  it 's now been renamed `` friulano '' , but sales are down . 
  i 'm afraid croatia should come out with a new name for its prosek . 
  i was excited , i still remember my very first euro purchase ( a newspaper ) , and my first atm euro withdrawal . 
  initially , having to multiply everything by 1936.27 in order to understand prices was a nuisance . 
  prices suddenly increased after the introduction of the euro , because they were all rounded up . 
  living very close to two other euro countries , however , i find that the convenience of not having to exchange currencies anymore is just incomparable . 
  i 'm still happy when i get one of the rarest coins ( for me , portuguese and finnish ) , but i do n't collect them .

  a relative of mine is a sicilian with a fiery viking-looking red beard , 
  yes , all people in the same y-dna haplogroup share a common male ancestor . 
  so all r1b people are `` cousins '' . 
  consider also that the current y-dna haplogroup distribution in europe is mainly the result of migrations happened just after the end of the last ice age , and that it has n't changed much since then . 
  the genetic map of italy , for instance , is reckoned to have been remained unchanged since pre-roman times . 
  the map illustrates the paternal y-dna haplogroups , which are transmitted from father to son . 
  it 's just a tiny portion of your dna sequence and it most certainly does n't affect the way you look . 
  for example , i took a dna test and i 'm r1a , which is `` slavic '' , but i do n't look particularly russian ( tall , fair skin with freckles , dark eyes and hair ) , it just means that i and millions of people in poland , russia , and ukraine share a common male ancestor who lived , according to genetists , somewhere in ukraine 20,000 years ago . 
  uk here , to my surprise . 
  too many questions about religion , however , and very little about immigration , the economy , etc.

  yes , in 2006 . 
  as long as you are in your home or workplace and your gun is legal ( i.e. 
  registered with the police ) , you can protect your life and property with a firearm . 
  many get carried away and shoot at fleeing burglars , or shoot out of the window , but that 's not allowed . 
  it 's a low paid job here too , and they also have to buy their own gun and ammo . 
  there 's some minimal training required ( at their expense ) , but it 's not a big deal ( 50 rounds at 10 meters every year or so ) . 
  the real problem is that not even regular police officers get much more training , they also just shoot about 50 rounds per year . 
  i shoot for fun , and i generally end up using about 800 rounds of handgun ammo per month . 
  i ca n't claim to know sweden well , since i 've only been to malm\u00f6 and lund , but the police officers i saw there , performing normal patrol duties , were armed with handguns . 
  in italy the various police forces are all armed , and so are private security guards in banks , supermarkets , universities , etc. 
  i see no problem with that . 
  i remember qzerty keyboards on typewriters . 
  not the real maple syrup , we can get that in europe , although it 's costly . 
  i 'm talking about the surrogate syrup , deliciously fake , that you can only find in the us . 
  it 's an impersonator . 
  best : there 's plenty of wonderful food in italy , my personal favorites are the simplest dishes : [ spaghetti alla carbonara ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbonara ) , [ eggplants parmigiana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eggplant_parmesan ) . 
  worst : [ casu marzu ( rotten cheese ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casu_marzu ) , with living worms !, 
  i can confirm that the comments to the article , although coming from readers with differing political opinions , are quite polite . 
  the topic is very complex , and nobody really knows about the implications for the rest of the euro area , or for the world 's economy . 
  however , imho , some of the expected consequences of an exit of italy from the euro can be summarized as follows . 
  italy by choice has no nuclear power , and it imports oil , natural gas , and raw materials at high prices , paying in euros . 
  a return to the lira and a subsequent devaluation would make those imports even more expensive . 
  italian manufacturers may be able to export more goods , which would become cheaper for buyers with a strong currency , but gasoline , heating , and electricity would become extremely expensive for italians . 
  all imports in general will become more expensive : foreign cars , electronic devices , etc. 
  only the rich could afford to vacation abroad . 
  also , the euro has helped keeping interest rates low on italy 's public debt over the years ( the actual savings are difficult to calculate , but economists agree that they exist ) . 
  with the lira , interest rates may increase and , given the high level of public debt , italy could be forced to default on its internally held public debt . 
  as a matter of fact , only 30 % or 40 % of the italian public debt is in the hands of foreign investors ; the rest is held by italian investors , i.e. 
  banks and families . 
  italian citizens who invested their savings in italian government bonds would suffer huge losses . 
  maybe in the long term the economy would recover , but in the short term all i see is a sharp decline in the living standards of ordinary italians . 
  nothing really special in italian , apart from a couple of mildly interesting cases : we call germany `` germania '' , but germans are `` tedeschi '' ( from deutsche ) , and their language is `` tedesco '' . 
  `` germani '' is used when talking about ancient german populations . 
  the dutch instead are `` olandesi '' to us . 
  `` alba '' is the feminine of `` albus '' , meaning `` white '' . 
  it may refer to an island ( `` insula '' ) , which is feminine in latin ( `` white island '' ) . 
  but why would scotland be called with a latin name in gaelic ? 
  the origin of the word `` italia '' is debated , but the most accredited explanation is that it comes from greek , via oscan ( the language of an ancient southern italian population ) , and that it means `` land of the calves '' ( the young cattle , not the anatomic part ) . 
  `` calf '' in latin is `` vitulus '' , in italian `` vitello '' , and it has an assonance with how we say `` italia '' . 
  it probably means that it was considered a rich land , where cattle abounded .

  how do you explain grillo then ? 
  he does n't appear on tv , yet he won a considerable portion of the votes . 
  also , hinting that only people with low iq would vote for berlusconi demonstrates a lack of understanding of a complex phenomenon , and it 's a dangerous understatement of berlusconi 's capability to attract votes . 
  the same error the democratic party did . 
  while not having verb conjugations , english is far from simple . 
  pronunciation is very difficult , and understanding native speakers requires a lot of training . 
  people learn english not because it 's simple , but because it 's an international lingua franca , mainly because of the us domination on business and media . 
  a big cup of coffee with milk , with pastries or cookies . 
  on sundays , i usually have american pancakes with maple syrup . 
  holding hands or kissing in public is bound to attract unwanted attention in italy . 
  in rome there have been reports of attacks on gays that displayed public signs of affection . 
  language barriers in europe are a serious obstacle to relocation , although this did n't stop in the past tens of thousands of migrant workers from leaving southern europe for germany and france . 
  the idea of a `` fresh start '' elsewhere in not very common in europe , because people are more deeply rooted in their home country/town than they usually are in the united states , so most migration is related to finding better job opportunities . 
  personally , when i 'm thinking of a fresh start , i think of the united states , where i 'd like to move . 
  are american eggs white because they are washed ? 
  or is it unrelated ? 
  eggs bought in supermarkets are usually clean ; those bought directly from farmers may have visible residues of fecal matter on the shell , i usually rinse them with water before use . 
  indeed , there is no divide . 
  but i ca n't see any region where five stars won the majority of the votes : data for the two white regions in the north are not available , but i can tell you they went to the democratic party . 
  http://www.google.it/elections/ed/it/results blue is berlusconi , red is the democratic party . 
  consider also that in a couple of `` red '' regions in the north the democratic party prevailed by less than 0.5 % . 
  standard italian , originated from the 14th century writers dante , petrarca , and boccaccio , is a polished form of florentine and remained relatively unchanged for centuries , being just a written language . 
  people used instead the local variants in their everyday life , already influenced by pre-roman linguistic differences ( celtic , greek , etruscan , etc. . . ) . 
  eventually , several dialects developed independently , and they are still today mutually incomprehensible . 
  real language unification only happened in the 20th century , with radio and , later , with tv programs using standard italian . 
  dialects are still alive , but they are now more prevalent in smaller towns , and in some regions ( notably in the south and in the north-east ) . 
  in every region , however , there is a very distinct accent . 
  wikipedia has a map of the different [ italian languages ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/italian_languages.png ) , which originate different accents , clearly identifiable , and one of the [ dialects ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:languages_spoken_in_italy_bis.svg ) . 
  i currently speak my dialect ( a variant of venetian ) when conversing with my elders and , without realizing it , whenever people address me in dialect ( quite often ) . 
  i drink coffee the same way as you , prepared with a moka , long , and without sugar . 
  the problem is , coffee must be really good to be enjoyed without sugar ; sometimes i 'm served coffee so bad tasting that i need to pour some sugar in it to make it drinkable . 
  personally not , but most people do . 
  much better now !, 
  that 's not short :p,
