  in theory cappuccino is a morning thing ; however , reports of clueless foreign tourists assaulted by an angry italian mob for ordering a cappuccino in the afternoon are greatly exaggerated . 
  anyone who eats salty food for breakfast is immediately identified as `` german '' in italy , 
  right , `` latte '' just means milk . 
  if you ask for a `` latte '' in italy you 'll get a glass of milk . 
  but we do say `` caffelatte '' , which is a sort of cappuccino , i guess ( i 'm not * that * initiated to the mysteries of coffee drinking ) . 
  til , thank you . 
  as a matter of fact , when i visited norway i really appreciated your coffee , definitely better than the american variety . 
  drinking espresso is not snob in italy , it 's just the way everyone drinks it . 
  starbucks should adapt to italian tastes if they want to sell their coffees here , since we perceive their coffees to be too watered down for our tastes . 
  and , btw , nobody says `` latte '' here when ordering a coffee , it 's a marketing trick devised by starbucks . 
  we only drink espresso , with several variants ( cappuccino , macchiato , etc. . . ) . 
  at home we use espresso machines , or a [ moka ] ( http://www.my-personaltrainer.it/nutrizione/moka.gif ) . 
  we call `` drip-brew '' coffee `` americano '' , and bars serve it almost exclusively to foreigners . 
  grillo won 25.5 % of the vote , the democratic party 25.42 % , berlusconi 21.56 % . 
  both the democratic party and berlusconi have formed alliances with other parties that allow them to reach , respectively , 29.54 % and 29.13 % of the votes . 
  full results can be found here ( in italian ) : http://www.corriere.it/speciali/politica/2013/elezioni/seas/politiche/camera/italia/20130224000000_20_italia_it.shtml, 
  we were a eu member before the euro , and we could continue being a member after the euro . 
   it was tailor made on the large advantage that berlusconi had at the time to hamper smaller parties . 
  and it was kept that way because the democratic party later thought it would have been in its best interest to do so . 
  unfortunately , yes . 
  devaluation was good for exports , but it would be a disaster now , energy costs would skyrocket . 
   old people and housewives are in his hand . 
  it looks like you ca n't understand either . 
  the 2006-2008 prodi government was such a disgrace that the electorate turned * en masse * to berlusconi . 
  not out of the eu , but grillo wants us out of the euro , apparently . 
  both grillo and berlusconi are opposed to the austerity measures imposed by monti , which is perceived as very close to germany 's merkel . 
  55 % of the votes to grillo and berlusconi is a big `` fuck you '' to monti and to the eu . 
  this is going to send shock waves all over the eurozone . 
  the gap between berlusconi and the democratic party is closing now , with just 250,000 votes . 
  there is the risk of berlusconi getting the majority premium in the lower chamber . 
  bersani might resign as leader of the democratic party tomorrow . 
  * gro\u00dfe koalition * anyone ? 
  38 billion would be a sizable sum , about 9 % of the total tax income for 2012 . 
  some [ sources ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/economia/2012/03/05/news/fisco_entrate_2011-30973320/ ) ( repubblica , in italian ) , however , claim that tax evasion amounts to 180 billions euro , so this phenomenon ca n't be fully attributable to tax dodging by the richest taxpayers . 
  let us assume you are right and that the number of rich people is actually , say , 10 times higher . 
  that would make the rich the 0.7 % of the taxpayers , still not enough to justify the downfall in tax collection you are attributing to `` self-employed people '' . 
  you are overstating the role of tax evasion by the rich . 
  only 0.07 % of italians can be considered rich ( yearly income of more than 300,000 euro ) , so even if you taxed them to death , you would n't get much in absolute terms . 
  the real problem in italy is the widespread evasion gimmicks in which even employed people engage : paying for goods and services without asking for an invoice ( vat evasion ) , buying and selling houses at a value higher than what 's stated on the contract , working without a regular contract , etc. 
  we have the strangest taxes : taxes on refrigerators ; taxes on elevators ; taxes on portable radio devices ; taxes on blank dvds ; taxes on advertising ; taxes on insurance ; taxes on rent contracts ; taxes for the 1935 war in ethiopia ; value added tax on taxes ... nobody knows how many taxes there are , and in most cases the cost of collecting them far outweighs the benefits . 
  they however serve the purpose of keeping a gigantic and inefficient bureaucracy busy . 
  i could listen to her accent for hours . 
   the thing is though , napkins are not part of the day-to-day eating habits of the english what ?!, 
  not even disposable paper napkins ? 
  `` beppe '' his short for `` giuseppe '' , or joseph in english . 
  points 1-3 also apply to italy . 
  i agree . 
  this `` holier than thou '' attitude has cost dearly to the italian left , but they still do n't get it . 
  does google translate work ? 
  it 's written in fake medieval italian . 
  i 'd say it 's a sign of education , not intelligence . 
  there are lots of educated idiots . 
  see , the problem with monti is that too many foreigners applaud the changes he brought ( basically , more taxes ) , while most italians hate him . 
  he 's going to get 1/3 of berlusconi 's votes , which is a dismal performance , after all what happened . 
  he 's actually at 7.5 % , he can reach 10 % with his allies . 
  ok , i 'll try with grillo this time . 
  thanks for your explanation , i was under the impression that berlusconism only referred to berlusconi and his supporters , not to the entire italian political and cultural spectrum . 
   i ca n't agree more . 
  i once read an article whose main point was that culture as a whole belongs and has always belonged to the ( italian ) left so why has italy allegedly stopped producing good culture ? 
  are leftist intellectuals only productive when they are subsidized by a sympathetic government ? 
  whiners who blame berlusconi for anything from global warming to the mt. 
  etna eruptions are the most annoying consequence of berlusconism . 
  monti is going to suffer a burning humiliation , he 's not good at campaigning and his decision to found his own political party has actually weakened him . 
  he made several successful tv appearances , and he is a master communicator . 
  he also promised to refund a loathed property tax imposed by the monti government . 
  unlikely as it may sound , this was a powerful move , since most italians are homeowners , and in turn forced the democratic party to promise lower tariffs on healthcare . 
  sex scandals do n't have much effect on a large part of the italian public opinion , as long as they do n't involve the misuse of public money ; moreover , he managed to convince many that the judiciary is not impartial and that he is being prosecuted for political reasons . 
  this allows many electors to dismiss his trials as part of the political battle . 
  in any case he is going to get half the votes he earned in 2008 , so not exactly a great success . 
  he enjoys considerable support in several parts of the wealthier north , where there is a medium class made of small business owners who are horrified at the thought of a leftist government . 
  most of berlusconi 's disillusioned voters are probably voting for grillo now , head of an anti-establishment party which is no friend of the democratic party , the main leftist party in italy . 
  i voted for berlusconi in 2008 , after the dismal experience of the prodi government , but i 'm not going to vote for him on sunday . 
  i 'm still undecided on whom to vote , but certainly not any party of the left . 
  there are educated people who vote ( d ) for berlusconi , even among redditors we have some isolated supporters . 
  to be honest , the youtube video is slightly out of sync , and the audio quality sucks ( i could n't find a better version online ) . 
  [ the quality of the dubbing is usually higher ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it2l4eavydm ) . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpz0faiiwk ) . 
  they use the same male , expressionless , voice , to narrate all the parts ( men , women , and children ) . 
  [ ... and in italian ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ualppujcngq ), 
  i did n't give a thought about dubbing until , when i was a teen , i saw a western movie dubbed in german were the indians were shouting `` achtung !!, 
  it was weird . 
  then you 'd better place your bet , because burlesque it 's now only 1.5 seconds behind . 
  and mario de la montaigne is going to receive a burning humiliation . 
  i think we might go to elections again within 1 year . 
  pffft , amateurs ... look at what italian `` translations '' do to the original titles : ** knight and day ** : `` innocenti bugie '' ( innocent lies ) ** the hangover ** : `` una notte da leoni '' ( a lions ' night ) ** not another teen movie ** : `` non \u00e8 un ` altra stupida commedia americana '' ( not another stupid american comedy ) ** the other guys ** : `` poliziotti di riserva '' ( spare cops ) ** no strings attached ** : `` amici , amanti , e. . . '' ( friends , lovers , and ... ) ( ? ), 
  it 's the same for me . 
  dubbing is not going away anytime soon . 
  people who are used to it simply wo n't accept subtitles . 
  this is going to backfire . 
  we 're having [ underground horse races ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/19/us-italy-vote-polls-idusbre91i0tq20130219 ) in lieu of election polls and the results are worrying . 
  so , who is worst ? 
  no , wait , i do n't want to know ... 
  same in italy , prices just doubled with the euro . 
  salaries did not . 
  i 'd say basketball , but also cycling and alpine skiing . 
  that 's why european countries are importing so much coal ; green energy can wait for another decade , i guess . 
  public transport sucks here , and i have to drive 50,000 km . 
  per year with my car . 
  also , having higher fuel prices than other european countries hinders competitiveness . 
  right , cost accounting was invented during the industrial revolution , probably independently in different parts of the world .
