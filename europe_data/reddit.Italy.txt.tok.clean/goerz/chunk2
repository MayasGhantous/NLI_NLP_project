  when my daughter was born , the city planted a tree in the woods in her name , but i did n't know it was an old tradition . 
  in italy we have [ carnevale ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnival ) in february , thought to be derived from the ancient roman festivals of saturnalia and bacchanalia . 
  on january 6th we have [ la befana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/befana ) , an old woman riding a broomstick and delivering gifts to children ( traditionally , dried figs and tangerines to good kids , coal to naughty kids ) . 
  befana is probably descended from the sabine/roman goddess named strina . 
  in sicily on the night between november 1st and 2nd there is the day of the dead , when the dead visit the houses of their relatives , hiding gifts for the children around the house , typically candies and sweets prepared especially for this occasion ( `` bones of the dead '' ) . 
  the cult of perchta was also present in northeastern italy , known as berta , bertha , or frau bertha . 
  the goddess and the demons appeared in folk tales until a century ago , and there is still a saying in italian to indicate a remote past , `` quando berta filava '' , i.e. 
  when berta was spinning , a reference to the legend of [ frau holle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mother_hulda ) . 
  most people do n't know it , but it 's a reference to pre-christian , i.e. 
  very ancient , times . 
  on january 6th in friuli great bonfires are lit , where a puppet ( representing a witch ) is burned . 
  it 's a reminder of pre-christian rites . 
  on the same day , a witch on a broom ( la befana ) brings gifts to children , a tradition originated in central italy . 
  only half of it , the occupied south . 
  in the north hitler reinstalled mussolini and the puppet state known as [ italian social republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_social_republic ) . 
  according to your logic , italy should have been on the winning side at the end of the war , while instead it lost some territory to yugoslavia . 
  i 'm no expert , i read it on wikipedia : http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/doppiaggio#la_tecnica, 
  they keep everything ( soundtrack , sound effects , laugh tracks ... ) but the dialogues are dubbed . 
  the production of the movie/tv series provides the dubbers with an audio track without the spoken parts . 
  everyday in large cities and tourist places in italy . 
  sometimes the police chase them away and they move a few meters down the street , other times they 're just tolerated . 
  i 've never experienced anything so extreme when i was in school , nor have my children so far , but i guess schools in southern italy are in a worse shape than those in the north . 
  canicatt\u00ec , a small town in sicily . 
  ac in schools is such an extravagant concept . 
  the school system in italy is so broke it can barely afford to pay teachers ' salaries . 
  parents often have to provide for essential school supplies out of their pockets . 
  exactly . 
  or , more frequently , no kids . 
   `` op z 'n italiaans '' is shagging her armpit . 
  not sure if there 's any truth to that . 
  wait , you mean not everybody does it ? 
  a titjob is a `` spagnola '' ( spanish , feminine ) in italian too . 
  there must be something going on in spain worth investigating . 
  are you thinking of spain ? 
  not in all languages . 
  we call it ue , which is quite the cacophony . 
  festung europa sounds much better . 
   in italy people sleep siesta there are indeed many differences between italy and sweden , but i 'm sure we do n't sleep siesta , whatever that means . 
  i 'm well aware of the fact that the us military [ has its own reasons for being here ] ( http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175755/ ) , and i 'm not under the illusion that us troops are here for our protection , although they still are a formidable deterrent . 
  i see having us bases in italy as part of the military alliance we 're in , but being on good terms with the us is also good for business : several italian firms have had access to lucrative us military contracts ( for example beretta for sidearms , fincantieri for building us coast guards ships ) , and there were also contracts for reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan . 
  however , the relationship with the us has n't always been easy : during the [ sigonella crisis ] ( http://everything2.com/title/the+sigonella+crisis ) in 1985 italy made clear that the bases are in italian territory and that they can be managed by the italian state in any moment , and the [ cavalese cable car disaster ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cavalese_cable_car_disaster_\\ ( 1998 \\ ) ) of 1998 strained relations between the us and italy . 
  i 'd say italian media cover national news 95 % of the times , then we get 4 % of news about the us ( because it 's cool ) , and 1 % for the rest of the world . 
  younger generations have n't experienced the cold war , that could explain the different disposition toward the us military presence in europe . 
  is italy ( or europe , in general ) an attractive destination for us military personnel ? 
  i mean , in terms of your career development , not for tourism potential . 
  interesting how renzi 's statement regarding the use was essentially ignored by the italian media , that focused instead on the revision of the stability pact . 
  on why the us military would want to keep its bases in europe , see for example [ the pentagon 's italian spending spree ] ( http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175755/ ) . 
  this is taken from the peace treaty with germany , revised in 1990 ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_final_settlement_with_respect_to_germany ) :  germany was to limit its combined armed forces to no more than 370,000 personnel , no more than 345,000 of whom were to be in the army and the air force . 
  germany also reaffirmed its renunciation of the manufacture , possession of , and control over nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons , and in particular , that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty would continue to apply in full to the unified germany ( the federal republic of germany ) . 
  no foreign armed forces , nuclear weapons , or the carriers for nuclear weapons would be stationed or deployed in six states ( the area of berlin and the former east germany ) , making them a permanent nuclear-weapon-free zone . 
  the german army could deploy conventional weapons systems with nonconventional capabilities , provided that they were equipped and designed for a purely conventional role . 
  germany also agreed to use military force only in accordance with the united nations charter . 
  article 11 of the constitution of italy reads :  italy repudiates war as an instrument of aggression against the freedom of other peoples and as a means for the settlement of international disputes . 
  italy agrees , on conditions of equality with other states , to the limitations of sovereignty that may be necessary to a world order ensuring peace and justice among the nations . 
  italy promotes and encourages international organisations furthering such ends . 
  this has n't been changed since 1948 , but it did n't prevent italy from bombing serbia and sending troops to kosovo , iraq , and afghanistan on `` peace '' missions , while , especially in afghanistan , troops were involved in actual combat duties . 
  for the limitations imposed to italy by the 1947 peace treaty , see articles 55 and following of the treaty ( http://www.diecifebbraio.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/treaty-of-peace-with-italy.pdf ) . 
  in short , no nuclear weapons , max . 
  250,000 soldiers , 200 tanks , no aircraft carriers , no bomber planes , max . 
  200 fighter planes . 
  the rules have been bended over the years : for example , we have two aircraft carriers , but i think they 're officially classified as helicopter carriers . 
  germany can not build a powerful military , because it 's forbidden by the wwii peace treaties . 
  italy has similar limitations . 
  until the treaties are revised , the us military is needed in europe . 
  not me , i 'm glad they 're here . 
  europeans will soon learn to disregard renzi 's empty rethoric . 
  well , we did this trick ( bar the citizenship part ) during the 2011 refugee crisis , but france and germany were n't enthusiastic about it . 
  amazingly accurate ( i think i speak american english ) , but i do n't understand how they came out with the singaporean dialect . 
  our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics 2 . 
  singaporean 3 . 
  american ( standard ) our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  romanian 2 . 
  italian 3 . 
  i do n't watch football and , according to some foreign friends , i do n't gesticulate at all . 
  but food-wise i fill the stereotype perfectly . 
  protection . 
  not sure yet , but i 'll be guided by a native !, 
  at the moment we 've planned only for bratislava and prague . 
  roadtrip to slovakia and czech republic . 
   from my grandparents generation almost everyone speaks english . 
  impossible , it 's known for a fact on reddit that no one over 30 speaks english . 
  awesome, 
  i like it , too bad they have n't developed a different design for each coin . 
  what 's the story behind this medieval knight ? 
  my main sources on the soviet union : mihail geller , aleksander nekric : storia dell ` urss dal 1917 ad oggi , 1984 . 
  ( an italian translation of a russian book ; i do n't think it 's been translated into english ) . 
  francis spufford , red plenty . 
  inside the fifties 's soviet dream , 2010 . 
  a unique mix of fiction and history that gives an insight on the reasons for the decline of the urss from the '50s to the '70s . 
  anne applebaum , gulag : a history of the soviet camps , 2012 . 
  it 's fun and requires some memory and attention . 
  you can find the rules here : http://www.pagat.com/fishing/scopone.html, 
  there 's also the `` scopone scientifico '' variant of scopa , where all the 40 cards are handed to two teams of two players at the beginning of the game . 
  i remember hot sicilian nights being played away this way when i was visiting my relatives . 
  it probably depends on the area . 
  my daughter is in school now ( in the north ) and less than 1 % of the students opt out . 
  catholicism in italy is a mandatory subject in schools of all levels , but individual students can opt out ( they are not always offered an alternative program , however ) . 
  the religion teachers and the programs taught are chosen by the church , but the state pays their salaries . 
  there are 2 hours a week in primary school ( grades 1-5 ) , then 1 hour all the way to the maturit\u00e0 ( high school diploma ) .
