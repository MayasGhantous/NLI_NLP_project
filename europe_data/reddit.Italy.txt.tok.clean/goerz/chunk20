  for italian literature , i would also mention : [ 13th century poets of the dolce stil novo movement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dolce_stil_novo ) [ the poetry of angelo poliziano ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poliziano ) [ ariosto : orlando furioso ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orlando_furioso ) [ pietro bembo : prose della volga lingua ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pietro_bembo ) [ tasso : la gerusalemme liberata ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jerusalem_delivered ), 
  i think that having the uk in is good for the eu : it 's like a reality check for other member states when they make delusional proposals , such as levying a tax on all financial transactions , that get regularly stricken down by the uk . 
  also , the eu economy would lose credibility without london 's strong financial market . 
  a better sociological analysis is provided by the `` high/low context '' classification of cultures : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_context_culture in low context cultures , information is not implicit , that 's why it is considered normal and perfectly acceptable to ask . 
  in high context cultures , you are supposed to retrieve the necessary information from the environment that surrounds you , so you have to guess . 
  italy is a high context culture . 
  i do n't personally like it very much , but the series is popular and it 's set in a fictional sicilian small town ( the episodes are shot on location in different parts of the island ) , which can be interesting in itself if you are n't familiar with the place . 
  in m opinion , romanzo criminale is a much better choice . 
  fuck rex , i miss kommissar derrick so much . 
  tv series : [ romanzo criminale ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242773/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) . 
  high quality production about rome 's most notorious criminal gang . 
  set in the '70s , with a fastidious attention to details ( clothes , cars , etc. ) . 
  edit : i corrected the link , that previously redirected to the 2005 movie , not to the 2008 tv series , which is definitely superior . 
  for me it 's denmark : a beautiful country which i toured extensively , it has an awesome capital , nice little historical towns , fairytale castles , and friendly people . 
  then the netherlands , especially amsterdam and delft : i love the architecture , and i could spend a week in the rijksmuseum . 
  third place for austria , for its history , museums , and architecture . 
  here 's the border between italy and slovenia in gorizia-nova gorica : http://www.minube.it/foto/posto-preferito/170171/1052191 the picture is taken from the italian side , the car in the foreground is in slovenia . 
  the building on the background is nova gorica 's ( slo ) train station . 
  less , last year there were 2 dead and 561 injured , including many children . 
  fireworks , firecrackers and shooting firearms into the air : 2 men dead and 361 people injured this time , better than the last year . 
  so true !, 
  i occasionally receive some baskets myself : i once did some professional work for an association of apple growers and i received a basket of apple-based products for christmas . 
  my mother was a nurse and she sometimes received some small gifts from her patients . 
  once she managed to talk a carabiniere out of a traffic fine because he recognized her as his nurse when he was hospitalized ( my mother did n't remember him ) . 
  baskets of fine food are still a thing for professionals/business partner , as far as i know , but they are usually given as christmas gifts . 
  students at my university have always been enthusiastic of what they call the `` orgasmus '' program . 
   why are us tv shows aimed at women such popular visits on italian wikipedia ? 
  if you look at the full rankings , gossip girl and vampire diaries are on the list , too . 
  us tv shows are very popular in italy . 
  probably most italian wikipedia users fall in the demographics that is more likely to appreciate those shows . 
  the winter weather in northern italy is not exactly spectacular . 
  also , i 'm under the impression that scandinavians are more enthusiastic about outdoor activities than italians are , so there must be other explanations . 
  natale is also a man 's given name in italian . 
  `` di natale '' means '' [ son ] of natale '' ( the man , not the celebration ) . 
  this is my experience in italy , but please consider that traditions vary greatly on a regional level . 
  christmas eve is less important than christmas day itself , which lasts 2 days and includes dec. 26th . 
  on christmas eve there may be a light supper , usually based on fish . 
  my family always skipped this part . 
  sometimes family members exchange gifts , if children are past the santa claus phase , otherwise it 's done on christmas day morning . 
  sometimes we play tombola , a sort of bingo . 
  mass at midnight . 
  on christmas day we have a sumptuous family lunch at home , an affair which can last for several hours and requires a prodigious appetite . 
  there 's no fixed menu , but after an appetizer there are usually [ cappelletti in brodo ] ( http://www.adgblog.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cappelletti-in-brodo.jpg ) ( meat stuffed pasta in a turkey soup ) as a first course . 
  second course is usually stuffed roasted turkey , but it can really be any other meat . 
  dangerous quantities of wine , spumante ( italian champagne wine ) and [ grappa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grappa ) are also consumed . 
  traditional sweets are [ panettone ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panettone ) , [ pandoro ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pandoro ) , and [ torrone ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torrone ) . 
  dried fruit , oranges and tangerines complete the picture . 
  december 26th is also a holiday , and those unfortunate enough to have a large family must endure another lunch , with another side of the family , although usually not as lavish as the christmas lunch . 
  choosing one side of the family over the other for the main christmas lunch can cause years of bitterness and resentment from the `` ignored '' side . 
  most italians pity those poor foreigners who must endure living in places other than italy . 
  interesting suggestions , thanks !, 
  i 'm going at the end of march though , so i think the football season will be over by then . 
  is a swamp tour worth it ? 
  ok , i 'll head to / r/colorado then . 
  thanks !, 
  how long does it take to drive from denver to moab ( ut ) along the i-70 and through the rocky mountains at the beginning of april ? 
  3 days in new orleans ( not during mardi gras ) . 
  suggestions ? 
  there are plenty of people who ca n't speak czech , but they are n't all called `` mute '' . 
  could it be just an assonance ? 
  that is , the name ancient germans gave to themselves resembled the word `` mute '' in slavic languages ? 
  for example , the czechs in italian are called `` blind '' , but that 's just because the pronunciation of the word `` cechi '' is identical to the corresponding italian word for blind . 
  the spelling is a bit different though . 
  `` sclavus '' is medieval latin , derived from byzantine greek ; the romans instead called their slaves `` servus '' ( pl . 
  `` servi '' ) , and i do n't think they had any contact with slavic populations , who back then lived well beyond the reach of the roman empire . 
  the [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_peoples ) article on the history of slavic populations makes for a fascinating reading , for those so inclined . 
  there are no nicknames i 'm aware of . 
  also the italian salutation `` ciao '' derives from venetian `` s ` ciao , meaning slave : `` i 'm at your service '' . 
  similar to austria 's `` servus '' . 
  i 'm not particularly proud of writing this , but since you 've asked ... here are the nicknames/slurs used in ne italy , near austria and slovenia , and the city of trieste . 
  possibly derogatory . 
  i do n't know the meaning , mainly used by italians who used to live in istria until wwii . 
  all former yugoslavian people : s ` ciavi ( slaves ) . 
  strongly derogatory , taboo word . 
  all german speaking people : crucchi ( may be jokingly spelled krukki ) . 
  derogatory , i read it originated from the croatian word kruh , meaning bread , during wwi . 
  southern italians : terroni , from terra , land , i.e. 
  those who work the land , peasants . 
  derogatory : the terroni are to northern italians what italians are to the rest of the world . 
  very interesting , thanks !, 
  there are old folk tales of a `` frau berta '' living in the woods in friuli . 
  also , there 's a proverbial saying that goes like `` back when berta was ~ ~ forming a string ~ ~ spinning wool '' , to indicate a very ancient time , that nobody can make sense of , but that it said to refer to the times when perchta was commonly revered as a goddess . 
  i find fascinating how these ancient pagan relics survive the millennia and resurface in modern times . 
  i think it would n't be politically correct banning hookah tobacco . 
  i live near trieste , and we also have both st. nicholas ( with krampus ) on dec. 6th , and santa claus ( babbo natale , or father christmas ) on dec. 25th ( a more recent addition ) . 
  the st. nicholas thing , as i found out growing up , is strictly local and unheard of in other parts of italy . 
  it might be a heritage of austria-hungary . 
  in nearby udine in fact they celebrate st. lucy ( dec. 13th ) . 
  on the eve of january 6th ( epiphany ) we have a full-fledged 17th century witch flying on a broomstick ( befana ) bringing sweets and fruit for good kids , and coal or potatoes for evil ones . 
  in the friuli countryside huge bonfires are lit , often with a dummy witch on top : it is said to be a celtic tradition predating christianity . 
  i 'm old school . 
  that 's it , if they ban my beloved flavored cigarillos , i 'm going to vote for the most anti-eu party i can think of . 
  those who vote for berlusconi tend not to give a fuck about what foreigners may think of them . 
  they pursue their self-interest ( real or perceived ) , in terms of keeping the left out of power and paying lower taxes . 
  this time , however , berlusconi wo n't make it to prime minister , although he can be 100 % certain to be elected again . 
  i 'll check it out , thanks !, 
  i wish politicians still sported such epic beards . 
  i agree , pertini should be in the list of the good guys . 
  he was a philosopher , a historian , a master of italian literature , and also a politician , but never a head of state . 
  i 'd also add that he 's been massively maligned and misrepresented in the last 500 years , and rarely read .
