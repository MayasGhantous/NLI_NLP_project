   i wish france , and the europeans countries create a unified fiscal system to limit this kind of selfish behaviours . 
  no way , what we need is a healthy fiscal competition among eu countries , otherwise people may not realize that their politicians ' retarded fiscal polices have adverse consequences . 
  good point . 
  also , he intentionally wants to cause a wave of criticism from his opponents , especially from abroad . 
  the more he is criticized in europe , the stronger he becomes at home , because he then can say to his electors : `` see ? 
  they fear me ! '' . 
  i 'm under the impression that angela merkel has done him a great favor by openly speaking against him . 
  italy : strangers : handshakes only . 
  relatives : 2 kisses , cheeks , sex irrelevant . 
  close friends : 2 kisses , cheeks , sex irrelevant . 
  not-so-close-friends could limit to a handshake , unless it 's a special occasion ( birthday , christmas , etc. ) . 
  after how much time without seeing each other ? 
  24 hrs . 
  i 'm from the north and this is my personal experience in terms of kissing etiquette . 
  my relatives in the south are more enthusiastic kissers though . 
  on a side note , i find interesting that bill clinton is still among the world 's most influential people , while george w. bush is not . 
  has he just disappeared from public view ? 
  when i was vacationing in rhodes the elderly seemed all excited to learn that we were italian . 
  one even performed a fascist roman salute , to make us feel more at home . 
  i remember that when i was 10 and i was learning about european geography for the first time , i thought it was awesome we had `` cousins '' speaking a latin language on the other side of the iron curtain . 
  44/45 , mixed up kosovo and montenegro . 
  this game used to be less challenging when i was in 5th grade !, 
   you can be a conservative and still use your brain ( there are lots of conservatives who do ) my brain has served me well so far , thank you very much . 
  you must be delusional if you believe that all the italians who have access to international media belong to the leftist * \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f * . 
  no if you believe that he 's innocent and that he 's been framed by leftist judges . 
  berlusconi 's supporters think that the judges ' attempts to remove him from power are politically motivated . 
  to be honest , judges have done little to prove that they are not partial in the last two decades . 
  not if you 're a banker  however it has nice museums , theaters , goethe 's house , and lots of places where they serve the local eppelwein . 
  it 's europe 's slow suicide . 
   nonetheless , what you do n't want to do is wear shorts and those fucking baseball caps . 
  shorts and baseball caps are a very common attire for the italian hot summer days . 
  however , despite being guilty of this myself from time to time , i 'd never show up in vienna in shorts , 
  note how the orientation of the windmill is determined by the american-flagged tail fin . 
  very subtle ... 
  a spy swap ? 
  now that 's an expression i have n't heard since the end of the cold war . 
  no range is complete without a bar  in a smaller range i used to attend we also had barbecues every saturday . 
  unfortunately not . 
  i 'd love to , but i 'm afraid i 'd have to sell something to make room for new purchases . 
  the calibre combined with the length of the barrel makes for an extremely accurate rifle , with a very tolerable recoil . 
  this model is actually the most popular in shooting competitions ( pre-1945 military surplus category ) . 
  shooting with iron sights at this distance requires some training , but once you get the hang of it you can get excellent results . 
  close but no cigar  it 's a swedish mauser ( see comment below ) . 
  admittedly , it 's difficult to tell from the picture . 
  but i also have a kar98k , soviet capture . 
  i restored the stock because it was n't in a good shape , but the barrel rifling is great . 
  it 's a carl gustafs m96 `` swedish mauser '' rifle , calibre 6.5 x55mm. , [ manufactured in 1910 , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/am0jk.jpg ) pictured at the 300m . 
  rifle range . 
  i agree , ipsc is so much better than static shooting . 
  too bad my local club has closed , and the nearest one is 100 km . 
  away . 
  weird , we have a catch-it-all license . 
  once you are licensed , you can buy whatever you want , within the limits of the law . 
  i own several handguns and rifles and [ i shoot them regularly . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/edugxxp.jpg ) i also moderate a small sub dedicated to guns in europe , / r/europeguns . 
  the border between italy and slovenia in [ gorizia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorizia ) runs through a [ square  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/nova_gorica-train_station-from_via_giuseppe_caprin.jpg ) the building you see in the background is in slovenia , the picture was taken in italy . 
  it 's not the first time i read of people entering the eu with fake italian ids . 
  it makes you wonder on the effectiveness of border controls in airports . 
  what is the old one ? 
  the [ marcia reale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvft615a14a ) ? 
  it seems perfectly normal to me . 
  in the middle age there were violent feuds among noble families in almost all italian cities ( see orsini and colonna in rome , for example ) . 
  living in a fortified tower was necessary if you did n't want to be slaughtered by your enemies . 
  to be honest , there 's not much information about georgia in our news . 
  i remember [ eduard shevardnadze ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eduard_shevardnadze ) , and the russian invasion of 2008 . 
  there 's no generalized opinion/stereotype about georgians where i live . 
  * how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  every day * how often do you visit / r/europe [ 2 ] ? 
  every day * what country are you normally resident in ? 
  italy * do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  italian ( first language ) , german ( beginner ) and slovenian ( beginner ) . 
  * what interests you about europe ? 
  politics , business , economics , news * what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe [ 3 ] ? 
  favorite thing is the interaction with other europeans : i 've learned a lot about my continent in the years i 've passed on this sub . 
  least favorite is the childish behavior of those who ca n't stand that sometimes people have opinions that differ from their own . 
  * do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  just of a couple of very small subs , nothing comparable in size and complexity to / r/europe * why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  i like this community and i think i can contribute a little . 
  * why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  i 'm a poised middle-aged man who does n't like conflict . 
  i 've been on reddit for 8 years and i do n't think i 've never had heated discussions with anyone . 
  * do you have any expirence with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  no , unfortunately . 
  i can make automoderator perform some basic tasks , however . 
  * what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  i think the mods gave the impression they wanted to censor anything remotely related to immigration , thus fueling the extremists . 
  immigration is a hot topic in europe right now , people are going to post and discuss about it , and it ca n't be confined to a megathread . 
  * what 's one weakness you have ? 
  i like the us very much  besides that , there are some periods of the year when i do n't have much time . 
  * would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  one hundred duck sized horses , ducks can be nasty . 
  * what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  explain why [ i suck at puzzles .

  today my 6.5 x55mm . 
  swedish mauser m96 ( manufactured in 1910 ) at the 300 m. range ( pictured ) , then i think i 'll shoot my .45 acp kimber 1911 handgun . 
  saturday is range day for me , so [ this is how i 'll spend my afternoon ] ( http://i.imgur.com/edugxxp.jpg ) .
