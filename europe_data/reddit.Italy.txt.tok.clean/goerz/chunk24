  indeed , it 's `` scuri '' in dialect . 
  the red star was dressed as christmas star in december 1991 , the year of slovenian independence . 
  later it was removed and it is now exposed in a small museum inside the train station . 
  exactly , there was a fence in the middle of the square . 
  if you wanted to cross the border , you needed to use one of the border crossings and show your papers to the border guards : the closest was about 100m away . 
  the building in the background is nova gorica 's train station , in slovenia . 
  the bike in the foreground is in gorizia , italy . 
  corporate tax for italy is understated : 27 % is just the income tax ( ires ) , but corporations also have to pay another regional tax , called irap , calculated on gross income ( income before interest and salaries ) and ranging from 3.9 % to 5.25 % . 
  moreover , all companies ( and individuals ) must pay taxes in advance ( calculated as 100 % of the current period 's income tax payment ) . 
  so the effective tax rate is more like 35 % , but it 's difficult to measure precisely , because ires and irap rates apply to different taxable incomes and therefore can not be summed . 
  too late , i 've already visited . 
  but i only went to bratislava , i 'd love to see the mountains and other areas in the east . 
  still more likely than italy . 
  [ tornado near venice , july 2015 . 
  ] ( http://www.youreporter.it/video_tutti_i_primi_video_tornado_in_veneto_8_luglio_2015 ) [ this is the aftermath ] ( http://www.youreporter.it/video_edifici_mitragliati_dal_tornado_come_dopo_un_bombardamento ), 
  i was n't talking about carrying , but about owning handguns , that in italy [ is legitimate for home defense ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4645228.stm ) and it does n't require more paperwork than owning a hunting shotgun . 
  in order to carry a concealed gun you need a valid reason : for example , [ jewelers ] ( http://cdn.thesocialpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rapina-gioielleria-calci-rapinatori-pistola-video-686x341.jpg ) , criminal lawyers , [ people who received threats ] ( http://st.ilfattoquotidiano.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/stefano.jpg ) , [ wealthy individuals that fear for their life ] ( http://images.derstandard.at/2011/05/13/1304581900888.jpg ) can apply for a ccw license . 
  gun control has always been one of r/europe 's favorite circlejerks . 
  in italy you do n't need different permits for owning handguns , shotguns , and rifles . 
  in any case , the shootings in naples mentioned by the article were gang related , and criminals do n't need permits to carry a gun . 
  who says we do n't have handguns ? 
  we definitely do . 
  they are not , they are a quarter r1a , which this map mislabels as slavic . 
  it means that a quarter of swedes and most poles share a common male ancestor who lived in today 's ukraine about 20,000 years ago . 
  it 's correct , but there 's much less variety in mt-dna , so it 's not that informative in studying ancient migrations . 
  paternal ( y ) dna is more useful in this sense , as long as you do n't try to link haplogroups with ethnicities , as this map does . 
  the legend on the top is rubbish : y-dna haplogroups originated thousands of years before the ethnic groups mentioned on the map . 
  the r haplogroup for example is indo-european and it entered europe during the great neolithic migrations , separating in r1a and r1b . 
  slavic , saxon , celtic , etc are ethnic identities that emerged thousands of years later . 
  finally someone who understands statistics . 
   `` we know the car is going to be an obsolete object , so we can take parking structures and turn them into anything , '' is this guy serious ? 
  the number of passenger cars has increased in the eu over the last 5 years : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/passenger_cars_in_the_eu#main_statistical_findings, 
  and you just reminded me that i 'm out of kisla repa ... 
  i do n't think my kids ( aged 12 and 9 ) know that the eu exists , they 've never mentioned the issue , and neither have i. i 'll ask them tonight . 
  edit : they heard about it , but they have no idea of what it is . 
   why german homework ? 
  some people study german in school as their second foreign language . 
  my kids , for example . 
  i think england in latin is anglia . 
  the eu bureaucrats are n't capable of stopping the inflow of illegal guns , but they are desperate to show that they are doing something , anything , to protect european citizens from terrorism . 
  what 's better than introducing `` new restrictive rules on some specific highly dangerous categories of firearms '' ? 
  it 's not like ordinary citizens are going to read the details of this useless directive , and the commission will be able to boast in the next press conference that they take the issue of our security `` very seriously '' . 
  i 'm actually surprised that the parliament is trying to stop this , i did n't think we gun owners were capable of lobbying successfully . 
  probably just people going to a marriage or some other celebration . 
  italians like to dress up . 
  just note how many italian redditors keep reinforcing the idea that italy is a `` very corrupt '' country and that you need to pay bribes for getting anything done in your everyday life . 
  i 'd suggest them to try to bribe their way out of a speeding ticket and get back to us with the results . 
  europe is riddled with corruption -- or so its citizens believe . 
  three-quarters of respondents to a eurobarometer survey in 2013 said they felt that corruption was widespread in their country ; in italy the figure was a cynical 97 % . 
  corruption , as measured by such surveys , seems to sap growth . 
  a report published in march by rand europe , a think-tank , claimed it costs the continent $ 179 billion - $ 990 billion ( $ 203 billion - $ 1,130 billion ) a year . 
  but getting accurate data on corruption is inherently difficult . 
  perception-based measures are often used , but economists have long questioned whether these reflect reality or common biases . 
  just as people systematically overestimate levels of immigration , what if they report corruption according to what they feel , rather than what they know ? 
  a working paper by lucia rizzica and marco tonello of the bank of italy offers evidence about one potential source of bias in italy : the media . 
  news reports provide information about instances of corruption , but they also communicate widely held views about its prevalence . 
  the authors test whether people 's perceptions of corruption are influenced by the news . 
  people are asked about the chances of a public servant suggesting a bribe , or a corrupt public servant being jailed . 
  over the same time that people were surveyed , the economists constructed a measure of exposure to corruption-related news , by counting the number of times corruption-related buzzwords appeared on the front pages of 30 national and local online newspapers . 
  people do seem to respond to media coverage by becoming more pessimistic about corruption in public institutions . 
  an increase in potential news exposure of one extra story raises perceptions of corruption by around 3.5 % and cuts trust in the effectiveness of the judiciary system by around 5.2 % . 
  this is not necessarily evidence of misinformation . 
  journalists are meant to hold those with power to account for their misdeeds ; the results could suggest that the public is updating its views given new information . 
  but the researchers split the news coverage into two types : reports of specific instances of corruption , such as a new bribery investigation into a named politician , and more general claims , such as a discussion of whether italy is more corrupt than other countries in europe . 
  when the researchers exclude days when only fuzzier claims are reported , the statistically significant relationship between news and perceptions of corruption disappears . 
  in contrast , when the researchers excluded days when specific instances of corruption were discussed , the relationship between the news and public gloom strengthened . 
  in other words , italians ' view of corruption appears to be shaped more by waffle than by hard news . 
  although only suggestive , the study is cause for concern . 
  the media can set the agenda , but also distort it . 
  there is some countervailing evidence , that relative rankings of corruption do have some validity : diplomats from countries where corruption is seen as more pervasive are less likely to pay parking fines , for example . 
  but if perceptions are heavily influenced by the media buzz , then levels of corruption might be exaggerated . 
  in other words , measures of corruption could themselves be corrupted . 
  we do have air conditioning at home in italy and electricity consumption indeed surges in the summer . 
  who said we did ? 
  it 's their border , if they want to deploy soldiers they do n't need to ask for italy 's permission . 
  the real issue is : are we going to have a new calais on the brennerpass ? 
  yes , i meant the bolzano region ( s\u00fcdtirol ) . 
  it 's an historical map , trento and trieste were part of the austrian empire in 1910 . 
  the map shows ethnic divisions in austria-hungary . 
  bolzano is in s\u00fcdtirol and had ( and still has ) a majority of german speakers . 
  why do you care ? 
  he decided that public transportation in italy is third-worldish . 
  he 's most likely never been to italy . 
  you were talking about trains , now you switch to buses ... ok , let 's talk about buses : why would you want to show your ticket to the driver ? 
  bus drivers in italy do n't concern themselves with tickets . 
  there are random checks on the buses , the fact that you were n't checked does n't mean checks do n't exist . 
  you buy a ticket , then a railway employee on the train checks whether you are travelling with a ticket . 
  what else do you need to make sure people pay their fare ? 
  too bad the eu commission 's proposal wants to confiscate all legally owned semiautomatic rifles ( category b7 of the directive ) . 
  this is why [ there is so much resistance ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-shooting-clubs-lobby-against-eu-gun-control/a-18933020 ) , including in the eu parliament : it 's a provision that would only affect legal gun owners , and not terrorists . 
  yes , he is indeed very quotable . 
  too bad he is not as good at acting as he is at formulating grand speeches . 
  i did n't find the quality of food in the usa ( specifically , colorado ) to be considerably worse than what i can find here in italy : fruits and vegetable , if not bought off-season , were good , and so were eggs and fresh orange juices from florida . 
  we did n't . 
  the origin of the rossi surname posted above is historically inaccurate . 
  the langobards left several words of germanic origin in our language , including several first names and some last names ( mostly patronymic ) , and rossi is n't one of them . 
  for me the quintessential american sound is the [ distant freight train horn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkhetmt9y8o ) . 
  another example of how italy really is a divided country : in trieste the memory of the hapsburgs is revered and there are still portraits of franz joseph hanging on the walls of some homes and businesses . 
  i was once stopped by the croatian police while driving at night . 
  in 15 seconds they deemed me not to be a threat to the croatian national security and they let me go .
