  easy , even if it hangs at the louvre in paris : leonardo da vinci 's [ la gioconda ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/mona_lisa.jpg ) , also known as monna lisa ( lady lisa ) , or mona lisa in english . 
  wonderful art . 
  i vote for american gothic . 
  yeah , it 's not like he was fired by the boss of his own party who wanted to take his job ; instead he `` resigned '' . 
  it makes ms. malmstr\u00f6m cry . 
  wow , that 's really restrictive . 
  if he had a license , why were the guns confiscated ? 
  in other news : [ a centre-right alliance led by silvio berlusconi would be the most likely winner if italians were to vote now under a reform proposal currently before parliament , according to an opinion poll published on monday . 
  ] ( http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2014/02/04/italian-poll-shows-reform-plan-could-favour-berlusconiled-centreright/ ), 
  indeed it is , it created a lot of controversies back in 2001 . 
  it 's also included in this bbc article about berlusconi 's most famous quotes : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15642201, 
  in the wake of 11 september attacks : `` we must be aware of the superiority of our civilisation , a system that has guaranteed well-being , respect for human rights and - in contrast with islamic countries - respect for religious and political rights , a system that has as its value understanding of diversity and tolerance ... '' ( s. berlusconi ), 
  byzantium left , among other things , some wonderful mosaics in the basilica of san vitale in ravenna , the empire 's capital in the italy , dating back to the 6th century ce . 
  we 've already done it . 
  maybe it would be easier if you identified yourself as italian american , that 's something we can understand in europe . 
  if you say `` i 'm italian '' , people would immediately think you were born and raised in italy . 
  still in the north , but east of venice . 
  too bad i live in the rainy part of the country . 
  you mean [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v5yf2ijgka ) ? 
  along the border with italy , they speak italian in every single shop or restaurant . 
  edit : also on the coast : koper , piran , izola , portoro\u017e ... 
  i do n't know if she 's guilty , but i read a book about the case years ago , and there are many inconsistencies between her ( and sollecito 's ) statements and some of the events . 
  however , i do n't think the court managed to provide a convincing evidence of their implication in the murder , so i think they should have been acquitted . 
   italian government  deal with [ something ] lol, 
  italy : there are a ton of stereotypes , broken down by region , city and even village . 
  here are a few ( do n't take them too seriously ) : people from milan are believed to be industrious , but also workaholic and obsessed with money-making and appearance . 
  people from turin ( and piedmont ) are believed to be polite but insincere people from genoa ( and liguria ) are believed to be tight with money people from veneto are believed to be backwards , racist and drunkard . 
  people from emilia romagna ( bologna ) are thought to be down-to-earth people focused on good food and sex . 
  romans are perceived as obnoxious , vulgar and lazy . 
  neapolitans are believed to be cunning and devious , and also very passionate . 
  sicilians are seen as extremely jealous ( to the point of `` honor killing '' ) and mafiosi . 
  sardinians are seen as short , reserved , hot-tempered sheep-shaggers . 
  she should 've called [ these guys ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europeguns/comments/1v6g6k/how_italians_test_bullet_proof_vests/ ) . 
  still more likely than ukraine . 
  it sounds like a self-fulfilling prophecy : a 30 year old student who 's not even looking for a job anymore is going to become unemployable in a short time . 
  man , it almost sounds like the news report from a normal country  i 'm on mobile and i ca n't provide references , but we also had illegal immigrants in a detention center near rome sewing their mouths shut for protest , and pig heads delivered by mail to rome 's largest synagogue , and to israel 's embassy . 
  when i was in school there was still czechoslovakia . 
  in history we learnt about the defenestration of prague in 1618 , and about johannes kepler . 
  in literature we read franz kafka ( the metamorphosis , the castle ) ; we also listened to smetana 's `` my homeland '' in our music education class . 
  nothing else really . 
  sounds like utter bullshit to me . 
  and i thought [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vflpkn6elok/ugtrk6kzffi/aaaaaaaac28/pmwqcndkzzo/s1600/achtung.jpg ) was a welcome sign . 
  it comes savoy blue , the color traditionally linked with the savoy dynasty that reigned over unified italy from 1861 to 1946 . 
  there must be a reason ... 
  i really hate the idiot that enters the sauna , feels the sudden urge of pouring a bucket of water onto the stove , and leaves soon after . 
  true . 
  ok , i asked because there are masters that people take after getting their magistrale degree , so i was n't sure what you were referring to . 
  although certainly there are people who take more time than it would be normal to complete their university education , i find it hard to believe that 28 is the average age at which italians graduate . 
  do you have any statistics available ? 
  what do you mean by master ? 
  exactly : living with your parents is great in an agricultural society . 
  in today 's world , not so much . 
  do you get subsidies from the state when you move out ? 
  it 's more of a cultural thing than an economic problem ; i mean , unemployment now plays a big role in this trend , but it was the same even when the economy was booming . 
  the last point is especially true for university students who may rent a room in another town , often illegally , but are officially at home with their parents . 
  it 's irrelevant . 
  english is a global language because of the us dominance in business and entertainment . 
  the uk leaving the eu would n't change this fact . 
  not gon na happen . 
  many people go happily in their life without speaking english and i do n't see why this should change . 
  plenty of other stuff in italy this week , for example the weather : [ snow in cortina , ski competition canceled ] ( http://images2.corriereobjects.it/methode_image/2014/01/19/sport/foto%20gallery/cac1888-680632-01-02-20140118-160708_mgzoom.jpg?v=20140119201522 ) [ floods in modena ] ( http://images2.corriereobjects.it/methode_image/2014/01/19/interni/foto%20gallery/15216485_mgzoom.jpg?v=20140119194743 ) [ freak train accident in liguria ] ( http://ansa.it/webimages/large/2014/1/17/eb0e6f6f6adfad3898ec473c0890ae45.jpg ) and several murders [ , including a mobster , his girlfriend and their 3-year old found burned in their car . 
  ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=it&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.corriere.it%2fcronache%2f14_gennaio_19%2fcorigliano-tre-corpi-carbonizzati-un-auto-dea16cb6-80ec-11e3-a1c3-05b99f5e9b32.shtml%3ffr%3dbox_primopiano&amp;act=url ) ( google translated article ), 
  the region gets tons of money , both from the eu and from the national government . 
  embezzlement of public funds is widespread , and [ most certainly organized crime benefits from it . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11848048 ), 
  i do n't know about this specific episode , but periodically the various camorra factions go to war and they kill each other in large numbers , [ sometimes the death toll is of several hundreds in a few years . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raffaele_cutolo#camorra_war ) so 5 people killed together does n't seem that far-fetched . 
  what could the eu do ? 
  set up a sub-committee and issue a declaration of intent ? 
  i had to google them , no idea they existed . 
  [ giuseppe garibaldi , the `` hero of two worlds '' . 
  from the comment section ( auto translation ) :  very good , that black and white photo . 
   black and white photo weaken the feeling of horror , decay and despair . 
  you 're right , 59.5 million . 
  i do n't know why but i was convinced we were 61m . 
   how anyone could put the uk in the top third is beyond me . 
  have you ever been in london in the summer ? 
  i would n't say they are 40 million ( i do n't want to believe that there are just 21 million of non-bitchicus ) , but they are certainly overrepresented in international forums . 
  i used to be a regular visitor for years , but i have n't visited san marino since 2011 now . 
  until 4 or 5 years ago you had great restaurants at affordable prices , good shops for electronics and clothing , and plenty of guns . 
  nowadays everything is more expensive , and most of the gun shops are gone . 
  personally , i 've been trying avoiding to consume agricultural products from campania for several years now . 
  [ 18682 points ] ( http://url.geoguessr.com/5mvy ) . 
  it was n't easy , especially when dropped in a random forest . 
  medieval history textbooks are centered on italy . 
  from the barbarian invasions , to the longobard kingdoms , the monastic orders , the normans in sicily , the crusades , emperor frederick i barbarossa , frederick ii , the first communes , the maritime republics of genoa , pisa , and venice ... 
  we could join new jersey . 
  i like it how at the end of the video the speaker avoids the intricacies of the slovenian grammar by just saying `` let 's go to lunch ! '', 
  to his friends . 
   i always wanted to know how english sounds to nonspeakers [ it sounds like this . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrv9gr9y0om ), 
  it sounds similar to spanish , but i could n't understand a single word . 
  weird . 
  eu laws are binding . 
  ** italy ** i do n't have the time to summarize the many events that are happening in italy , but among the most important news , we 're having anti-austerity `` pitchfork protests '' ( with some [ neo-fascist undertones ] ( http://cdn.livenetwork.it/news/256679/gallery/765747_635223667324977513_forconifascisti_400x263.jpg ) ) all over the country : http://ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2013/12/12/tension-soars-pitchfork-protests-grind_9770063.html [ and here 's a nsfw video of a group of protesters in front of an eu building in rome , trying to swap the eu flag on the balcony with that of italy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9iruemfpce ) . 
  edit : the man who stole the eu flag , an activist of a right-wing movement , was sentenced today to 3 months in jail ( actually , house arrest ) and to a $ 100 fine . 
  i 'd say we 'd better stay where we are . 
  the us military still value their bases here . 
  germany 's ( and italy 's ) military capabilities are still severely crippled by the post wwii peace treaties . 
  you need to solve this issue before thinking of eu armed forces .
