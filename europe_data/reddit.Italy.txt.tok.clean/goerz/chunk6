  is n't it what we have been doing for the last 60 years ? 
  in veneto and friuli venezia giulia local languages are very alive and they are used every day by all social classes . 
  `` ciao '' is both `` hi '' and `` bye '' . 
  it 's informal , however , and should be only used with people that you can address with `` tu '' . 
  my profesorica assures me that sometimes slovenians themselves are n't sure about their grammar , and that 's a comforting thought . 
  is dual really used in spoken language ( besides the usual `` se sli\u0161iva '' ) , or can i go with the plural ? 
  i mean , i do n't plan on winning any slovenian literary prize in the near future . 
  by adding the appropriate suffix , in italian we can make things ( and persons ) smaller ( - ino ) , larger ( - one ) , uglier ( - accio ) , or cuter ( - uccio ) . 
  and if you add that there are six cases and three genders , i can assure you that slovenian is a pain in the ass to learn for foreigners . 
  the various italian dialects are separate languages that evolved independently from latin , and they can be mutually unintelligible ( e.g. , venetian and sicilian ) . 
  the `` standard '' italian is based on the dialect of tuscany , and it became the language of italy 's intellectual elites since the renaissance , thanks to the works of dante , boccaccio , macchiavelli and guicciardini ( all writers and poets from tuscany ) . 
  ordinary people , on the other hand , continued to use their dialect . 
  for this reason , italian remained relatively unchanged through the centuries , because it was mainly a written and not a spoken language . 
  in the first half of the 20th century , radio and tv broadcasts contributed to the diffusion of standard italian all over the country . 
  one of the first uses of italian in an artistic context can be found in a [ 11th century fresco ] ( http://roma.andreapollett.com/s2/roma-c37.jpg ) in the san clemente and sisinnio church in rome , where all the text that describes the episodes from the life of st. clemens is in latin , but one scene is a comic depicting three workers , named albertel , cosmer , and carvoncelle , pulling a column that they thought was the saint himself . 
  one says `` falite dereto co lo palo '' ( `` push it from behind with the lever '' ) , while another shouts `` fili de le pute traite ! '', 
  ( `` pull , you sons of bitches ! '' ) . 
  so italian was first used in a `` serious '' context to characterize vulgar , obnoxious people . 
  i do n't see your comment in that thread , so it might have been removed . 
  did you try to contact the moderators ? 
  we do n't have registered civil unions either . 
  i do n't see italy allowing gay marriage in the next ten years , but you may be right , who knows what the future holds . 
  edit : adoption for gay couples ? 
  not in our lifetime . 
  italy 2 . 
  before 3 . 
  before 4 . 
  before , but in spoken language the currency is always placed after the number . 
  mine works fine . 
  i 'm using chrome and res . 
  for the historically inclined , the [ armoury of graz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/styrian_armoury ) is well worth a visit . 
  it was built in the 17th century , because they wanted to be ready in case of a new ottoman invasion . 
  but the turks never came , and the armoury still stands intact , with its original content of thousands of items of weaponry and armours . 
  i 'd try it . 
  it 's been the rule in italy for almost 40 years now . 
  in discount supermarket chains : $ 0.15 vending machines : $ 0.30 - $ 0.60 local stores and cafes ( refrigerated ) : $ 1.00 - $ 1.50 from an unlicensed street hawker in front of the colosseum : $ 2.00 - $ 2.50, 
  it 's a just a railway , get over it . 
  the building is nova gorica 's train station , the pictures are taken from the italian side . 
  in december 1991 , just after slovenia 's declaration of independence , the red star on top of the station was transformed in a christmas star , before being removed once for all a few weeks later and placed in a museum . 
  behold the worst dubbing ever , breaking bad in italian : [ `` i am not in danger , skyler , sono io la minaccia '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dkygltcxrg ) . 
  they even changed the meaning of the original dialogue . 
  i submitted voluntarily to the ordeal of learning german when i was a college student . 
  i just learnt the basics , because i did n't have much time , but i actually enjoyed it . 
  our teacher was from frankfurt and she was particularly thorough in teaching us the differences in pronunciation and lexicon between austria and northern germany . 
  at the end i was able to successfully communicate with the waiters in berlin , less so in m\u00fcnchen !, 
  good points , especially the part about him being glorified by the allied propaganda : defeating a powerful enemy brings much honor . 
  calling rommel a decent general is an understatement , he was undoubtedly a military genius , even at the beginning of his career in wwi . 
  and yes , he was used by the nazi propaganda machine , but he was also forced to commit suicide after the july 20th 1944 plot to assassinate hitler , of which he was informed . 
  btw , his son manfred , who was mayor of stuttgart for a long time , died a few days ago . 
  in italy only abrogative referenda are legal ( i.e. 
  aimed to cancel an existing law ) , while propositive referenda are n't . 
  and matters about taxation , amnesty and pardon , and international treaties ca n't be subject to a referendum , according to our 1948 constitution . 
  there is a minimum * quorum * of 50 % plus 1 of the potential voters for the referendum to be valid , whatever its outcome . 
  for this reason , those who oppose the abrogation of the law in discussion normally just abstain from voting , thus contributing to the invalidation of the referendum . 
  confirmative referenda can be held when the constitution itself is changed by the parliament , and when deciding to create new regions , or to move provinces from one region to the other . 
  to be honest , the article does n't really add new insight on the rise of the extreme right : alessandra mussolini has been a member of the parliament for almost 20 years now . 
  but i thought that it might be interesting for those who are not familiar with italy 's political scene . 
  rattling the establishment feels good . 
  so the danish couple sitting in the table next to mine and my wife 's in a copenhagen restaurant , who started chatting with us when they overheard us speaking italian must have been a really exceptional encounter . 
  i prefer the older designs : [ citro\u00ebn 2 cv ] ( http://img2.netcarshow.com/citroen-2cv_spcial_1979_1024x768_wallpaper_01.jpg ) ( i never really understood how to use the gear shift on the front panel on that one ) and [ citro\u00ebn ds pallas ] ( http://www.base4car.com/images/citroen-ds-pallas_key_5.jpg ) . 
  interesting . 
  in italy we are closer to france regarding formalities when approaching a stranger , and i have always considered tourists blurting out direct questions to me in english as very rude . 
  maybe we all encountered provincials . 
  i had the same experience : one man even spontaneously offered to provide us with directions in the metro , and in english on top of that . 
  but maybe he was n't a true parisian  in any case i noticed a big improvement in their attitude in the last 25 years . 
  * the most visited country in europe . 
  * strong centralized state , with uniform approach to regulation . 
  * the french tend to protest very vocally , especially farmers and truckers : when they go on strike , they paralyze the entire country . 
  * they export a lot of energy , mainly thanks to their many nuclear power plants . 
  * they have a lively movie industry and they make some excellent movies . 
  * the world 's biggest producer and consumer of wine . 
  * wonderful wines and great cheeses . 
  nouvelle cousine is not for me however , i think italian cousine gets you more value for money . 
  * the french are sometimes called by the italians `` our cousins on the other side of the alps '' . 
   they are already banned under national italian laws how can the ships be banned under italian laws if they 're still there ? 
  the ban has just been introduced , and it 's going to become effective on nov. 1st , 2014 . 
   he also gets cash from the cruise companies . 
  source ? 
  is the second victim paralyzed by terror ? 
  he seems standing still while the first victim is already down , until one of the killers comes back and finish him . 
  they got me on the ancient capital , on the balkan war of 1912 , and on one of serbia 's national holidays . 
  a basic level is n't enough , the goal is achieving fluency in written and spoken english . 
  i do n't know about france , but in italy , in 2013 , the school system does n't provide a working knowledge of english . 
  the teachers are n't native speakers ( and you know how pronunciation is difficult for us romance speakers ) and they focus on literature , because that 's what they know . 
  that 's why , besides watching movies and tv shows in the original language with her , i have to pay for a private institution where she can learn english from a native speaker . 
  it is n't fair that only those who can afford to spend extra money for their children 's education can guarantee that they 'll learn english , but that 's our school system for you . 
  but this study is only about adolescents , while the english data include adults of all generations . 
  maybe the difference would be smaller if you compared croat/bosnian teenagers with their english counterparts . 
  chinese ? 
  in italy the school system is spectacularly inept at teaching english . 
  i 'm spending a lot of money in private tutions for making my daughter learn english . 
  i thought i could understand a little french . 
  i was wrong . 
  never visited spain myself , so that 's what i have gathered from indirect sources : * their real estate market collapsed a few years ago , houses can be bought and rented at a discount now [ my parents want to spend the winter in a warm place and they found a reasonable deal for renting an apartment near valencia ] . 
  * hugely popular among british tourists . 
  * good food at affordable prices . 
  * very catholic , with a lot of religious processions and festivals . 
  * they like [ dressing in bright colors ] ( http://www.friendlyrentals.com/fr_imgs/blog/chicas%20freria%20de%20abril.jpeg ) in the south . 
  not a machine gun then . 
  i took the [ national geographic 's genographic test ] ( https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/ ) .
