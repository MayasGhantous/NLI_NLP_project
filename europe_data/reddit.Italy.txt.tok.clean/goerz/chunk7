  it costs about $ 200 , but it is currently on sale at $ 156 . 
  they send you a numbered kit with a couple of swabs to collect samples of your cells from the inside of your mouth , that you have to send them back . 
  please not that this test has nothing to do with the way you or your parents look , nor it is a genealogy test . 
  instead it investigates about your deep ancestry , i.e. 
  about the most likely route your ancestors took 70,000 years ago when they left africa .

  some random facts about italy : http://www.eupedia.com/italy/trivia.shtml, 
  yes , i 'm from friuli . 
  and despite popular opinion , slavic or germanic heritage is not as common as you might believe , because the major migrations in italy happened during the neolithic period , and what happened later had a relatively small effect on the population 's genetics . 
  from [ wikipedia 's genetic history of italy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_history_of_italy ) : migrations that occurred on italian soil from the fall of the roman empire until 1000 ad have probably not significantly altered the gene pool of the italian people . 
  [ 8 ] despite the lengthy goth and lombard presence in italy , it is estimated that the i1 haplogroup associated with the germanic peoples is only present among italians in the north in the order of 2-3 % and from 1 to 1.5 % among italians in the south . 
  [ 9 ] other haplotypes that could have been penetrated in italy together with the german invaders are haplogroup r1a which belongs to 2.5 % of italians and some subclades of the r1b haplogroup ( in particular the subclade r1b1c9 that owns 3.5 % of italians [ 10 ] and is particularly widespread among the peoples of north-west italy ) but because these haplogroups are just mentioned fairly commonly in other european ethnic groups it is difficult to establish whether they have been really brought into italy by germanic peoples or by other peoples ( e.g. 
  slavs ) . 
  the germanic or nordic heritage among the italians then wanders around 5-10 % . 
  my y-dna haplotype is r1a , subclade z280 , originated in the carpathians . 
  not common at all in italy . 
  i know this because i took the [ national geographic 's genographic dna test ] ( https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/ ) , because i have a great interest in history and i was curious . 
  i know my last name is a derivation of a germanic first name , as many italian last names are . 
  it constitutes no evidence in itself , but paired with genetic testing it becomes another piece of the puzzle of my deep ancestry . 
  but of course i 'm just talking about my paternal line , so it 's a small percentage of my overall dna . 
  i 've had fun anyway researching my origins . 
  thanks . 
  i took a dna test , and , although it 's not a conclusive evidence , i found out i have `` eastern european '' ancestry from my paternal line , dating back to thousands of years ago ( i also have a last name of germanic origin ) . 
  so i guess i may be a barbarian too , 
  how do you know ? 
  wonderful . 
  you should hang around / r/baroque more . 
  i do n't know for how long you plan to live , but you 're not going to be the last friulan speaker . 
  plenty of children still learn friulan from their parents . 
  [ she still is ] ( http://www.senato.it/leg/17/bgt/schede_v3/attsen/00001662.htm ) . 
   prior to the end of wwi , was a kingdom , with the last king being umberto ii . 
  it 's probably just a typo , but italy was a kingdom until the end of wwii , more precisely until 1946 . 
  i do n't know , do german tax payers have to pay in advance 100 % of their taxes before actually calculating their income ? 
  in italy we do . 
  taxes play a big role in our political debate . 
  for example : http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/a-complicated-tax-system-in-italy-buoys-berlusconi-a-926692.html, 
  i wish . 
  unfortunately , the government , despite paying lip service to simplification and de-bureaucratization , keeps writing laws so complicated and absurd that you need an army of bureaucrats to apply them ( and accountants , and lawyers ... ) . 
  there 's an entire sector of the population that actually thrives with this system , but they fail to understand that it only works as long as you can issue new public debt . 
  but then the hundreds of thousands of people necessary to keep the byzantine system working ( well , kind of , at least ) would be without a job ... our bloated public sector is dearly protected by most politicians , who do n't dare to touch such an important source of political approval . 
  it 's not concealed carry ( in most states you need a specific license for that ) , it 's an open carry , for which ( in some states ) you do n't need a license . 
  the logic is that someone with a concealed weapon could be more dangerous than someone with a weapon in plain sight . 
  for us in italy it 's the opposite , if you have a gun permit , you should always carry concealed , because a civilian with a gun in plain sight could cause alarm . 
  the only exception are uniformed security guards , who carry guns openly ( but i saw some of them carrying openly in civilian clothes too ) . 
  i concur , .45 caliber 1911 , officer or commander version . 
  i could n't tell if it 's actually a colt , however . 
  it does n't change the fact that what they did is still illegal . 
  what fiasco ? 
  the girl was n't theirs , was she ?

  it 's also good for the imports , esp . 
  oil and gas . 
  a strong euro can also be caused by an increased demand of euro-denominated treasury bonds from outside the euro area ( e.g. 
  china and us ) . 
  you did n't mention latin , so here it is : * ut ecclesiam videatis , museum transgrediendum est. 
  wow , i remember visiting frederiksborg castle years ago , it really is a wonderful place . 
  in italy i have experienced this only in trento : the sirens sounded everyday at noon . 
  i 've never understood the reason . 
  i rather enjoy my life in italy , but i 'd move to the united states if the opportunity arose . 
  it 's the foreign country i have more experience and knowledge about . 
  nice colors , but the horizon is tilted . 
  i was n't referring to you or to other commentators in this thread , but to the article and to its pictures ( people with yugoslavia t-shirts , etc. ) . 
  i really have this coin , my grandfather bought it when it was issued , not for ideological reasons ( he had his reasons to hate tito ) , but as a small investment , and i inherited it . 
  time to sell my 1973 yugoslavian gold tito commemorative coin , jugonostalgija seems to be at its peak . 
  i keep getting uk as a result at this test . 
  why milan ? 
  the first capital of the unified kingdom of italy was turin in 1861 . 
  or did you go back to ancient times ? 
  then maybe rome should be chosen , as it ruled for the first time over the whole italian peninsula . 
  also in parts of italy , on december 6th . 
  we still have a proverb from those times , `` mamma li turchi '' , a cry of fear for the arrival of moorish ( `` turkish '' ) pirates . 
  alarm guns are not firearms ( not even under the very strict uk firearm laws ) , they are noise-making devices shaped like guns . 
  altering them is already illegal , i do n't see how stricter gun control laws could have prevented this . 
  what part of `` illegally altered alarm guns '' did n't you understand ? 
  there 's no such a thing as free movement of guns and ammo in the schengen area . 
  there 's no evidence of guns being legally bought in one country and being illegally used in another , because criminals do n't have gun licenses and they do n't register their guns . 
  any restriction on legal gun owners would have no effect on curbing gun violence . 
  this one person happens to be the eu commissioner for home affairs , so not exactly a random eu politician . 
  also , english is today 's latin . 
  what a silly comparison : she wants more eu integration , while i 'm happy with the way things are . 
  so i 'm going to vote against her party , which happens to be very pro-eu integration . 
  i do n't care how european she is , i 'm european too and this proposal is just ridiculous . 
  1,000 europeans die every year because of firearms ? 
  besides being this an extremely low percentage of the eu population , what does she think to accomplish by toughening the regulations on air rifles and legally owned firearms ? 
  so now my registered and licensed guns are suddenly a problem , while professional criminals can continue using their illegal , full-auto guns and kill those 1,000 europeans per year undisturbed ? 
  that 's it , at the next elections i 'm going to vote for the most eurosceptic party i can think of . 
  europe does n't make me think of ancient rome , the us does . 
  and i doubt our continent will be more united 100 years in the future , but who knows .
