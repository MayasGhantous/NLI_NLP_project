  [ morally better humans reacting to the arrival of priebke 's hearse for his funeral ] ( http://it.notizie.yahoo.com/video/calci-alla-bara-di-priebke-165041585.html ) . 
  according to [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hylclgj.png ) in italy it 's supposed to be french , but i thought it was german ( i was n't offered french in school , i could choose either english or german as my first foreign language ) . 
  plenty of italians ( and of sammarinese apparently ) emigrated to argentina between 1850 and 1950 . 
  today a sizable portion of argentina 's population has italian heritage . 
  til . 
  are there other limitations on land and air forces ? 
  oddly enough , [ italy has more active aircraft carriers than any other countries except the us ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1obuyi/til_that_italy_has_more_active_aircraft_carriers/ ) . 
  also : [ the world 's aircraft carriers at a glance ] ( http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/these-are-all-the-aircraft-carriers-in-the-world_5087668a0cb54.gif ) . 
  i 'm not sure about germany , but there 's no us ban on italy 's military . 
  both germany and italy host several us military bases as a consequence of wwii , but that 's it . 
  yes , but she was doing it to ease your teething pains , [ it 's not like she sedated you and took you out in the rain when you were 8 months old to help her begging for money ] ( http://www.ilgazzettino.it/italia/cronacanera/narcotizza_figlio_per_chiedere_l39elemosina_anche_sotto_la_pioggia_rom_denunciata/notizie/338816.shtml ) . 
  children are often used by gypsies as props to beg money on the streets . 
  infants are sometimes kept sedated and carried by young gypsy women who beg for money . 
  we imported santa claus from the united states and we call him `` babbo natale '' ( `` father christmas '' ) . 
  before babbo natale , baby jesus himself brought gifts to children on christmas . 
  however , some pre-existing traditions survive from ancient times : on december 6th , san nicol\u00f2 ( st. nicholas , the original santa claus ) brings gifts to children in some parts of italy ( apulia , trieste , trento and bolzano ) ; in other parts , on december 13th , gifts are brought by st. lucy . 
  in sicily , children receive gifts directly from the dead , on november 1st . 
  finally , all italian children receive gifts from the [ befana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/befana ) , basically a 17th century witch on a broomstick , on january 6th ( epiphany ) . 
  1st november is an holiday in italy too , we visit cemeteries , light candles and bring [ chrysanthemum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:chrysanthemum_sp.jpg ) flowers to the tombs . 
  note that chrysanthemum flowers are only used in this occasion in italy , and they are therefore associated with death : bringing them as a gift to an italian would be a * faux pas * . 
  although some suspect that this is the reason why the pardon has been proposed in the first place , the ministry of justice has assured that berlusconi is outside the scope of this general pardon . 
  yes , of course , but i first check who is by looking out of a window . 
  but if i see a couple of middle-aged women holding pamphlets i do n't answer , because they are jehowa witnesses . 
  i 'd add that hundreds have escaped today from an improvised center in sicily , and i am under the impression that the authorities are not exactly bending over backwards in their efforts to bring them back . 
  a friend of mine is a carabiniere ( military police ) and he was sent to guard one of those camps in the south once , during the libyan crisis : he told me that sometimes , when there are too many immigrants and they start rioting , the police receive orders not to stop them if they want to leave , to release the pressure on the camps . 
  so i do n't expect that those who escaped today will remain in italy for long , because they want to reach northern europe . 
  ** italy ** * while boats with immigrants keep arriving in sicily , the parliament has started the process of wiping the criminal status of illegal immigration from italian books . 
  the crime was introduced by one of berlusconi 's governments in 2002 and its removal is strongly favored by leftist pro-immigration parties and by the integration minister cecile kyenge , an african immigrant herself . 
  in the meantime , detention centers around the country are beyond their capacity and the ones on the island of lampedusa are on the verge of collapse , [ with immigrants sleeping on bare earth ] ( http://video.sky.it/news/cronaca/lampedusa_accampamento_allaperto_nel_centro_di_accoglienza/v173851.vid ) . 
  * italian prisons are overcrowded and the parliament is thinking of a general pardon for those convicted of non-violent crimes . 
  the last pardon was issued by the center-left prodi government in 2006 and was highly controversial . 
  * [ erich priebke ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erich_priebke ) , a former ss-captain , died in rome aged 100 . 
  he was under house arrest for his involvement in the [ ardeatine massacre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ardeatine_massacre ) in 1944 . 
  a debate is undergoing about his funerals next week , because they are likely to attract right-wing extremists ( flowers were deposited in front of his house and swastikas have appeared on the walls ) . 
  * alitalia , the national airline company , after five years since it was last bailed out , is again on the verge of bankruptcy . 
  [ a new shareholder , the state-owned postal service group , poste italiane , is going to provide the necessary liquidity ( $ 300m ) for the short-term survival of the company ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/931e3432-3299-11e3-b3a7-00144feab7de.html#axzz2hbjod4wj ) , while a long-term solution could include a take over by air france . 
  the italian language was for centuries only used in literature and written texts in general , so its idioms are mostly literary , biblical , or taken from classical latin authors . 
  the funniest idioms then come from the languages spoken by the people , i.e. 
  the local dialects , although movies and tv have contributed to the creation of new italian idioms in the last decades . 
  what follows are some idioms in the trieste ( a city in north-east italy ) dialect : `` no gaver alba '' - lit . 
  `` not having a dawn '' : not having a clue about something , being ignorant . 
  `` go fuck the pussy of your mother '' `` tu mare grega ! '', 
  - `` your mother is a whore ( `` greek '' ) '' , used as the english `` fuck ! '' . 
  `` you are dumber than the pussy of a female donkey '' ( note how `` mona '' means at the same time `` vagina '' and `` dumb person '' ) . 
   agree . 
  all of the southern states should n't have come in . 
  are you talking about the euro or the eu ? 
  because italy is one of the founding member of the eu , it 's not like it was let in at a later stage . 
  i do n't think this map takes dead languages into consideration . 
  i studied latin and ancient greek in school , but they were n't considered foreign languages , i still had to take english as my `` first '' foreign language . 
  same here , i speak some german , but i 'm far from proficient . 
  alitalia ( again ) . 
  he lost the elections because he raised taxes . 
  he is hated by berlusconi 's press . 
  well before the unification : italians have been screwed over the centuries by popes , spanish viceroys , borbon kings , savoia kings , mussolini , etc. 
  that they have developed a contempt for rules and authorities . 
  there 's always been mutual distrust between the italian state and its citizens , a national trait that probably goes back in time several centuries . 
  berlusconi posed as an outsider to the political establishment , a friend of the little man and an enemy of the powerful and greedy state bureaucracy ( not that he actually ever delivered any of his promises , though ) . 
  but the tax problem is real , and until it is fixed the populists are going to take advantage of the situation once again . 
  absolutely . 
  libya under gaddafi was a police state and the immigrants were kept in horrible conditions . 
  italy had an agreement with libya 's gaddafi , and it worked , but when he wanted to get the upper hand in some negotiations he just released hundreds of refugees on the italian coasts . 
  oh , i always vote , and i also think that ep elections follow the same rules everywhere . 
  however , while i like to consider myself a reasonably informed person , i ca n't remember who i contributed to elect to the european parliament with my vote ( while i know exactly whom i voted for at the national elections ) . 
  weird . 
  the problem is that i have no idea who my mep is , let alone of what she/he thinks about the cap . 
  in italy , the eu parliament is regarded little more than a retirement home for failed politicians . 
  in other news :[ eu tobacco farmers recently asked for more subsidies ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/23/eu-agriculture-tobacco-idusl5n0hj30320130923 ) . 
  tobacco producers are going to oppose tough restrictions on cigarettes . 
  yeah , i could n't believe it when i read the news . 
  ** italy ** * [ at least 130 african migrants have died and many more are missing after a boat carrying them to europe sank off the southern italian island of lampedusa ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24380247 ) .

  earlier this week , another 13 migrants drowned while attempting to reach the sicilian coast . 
  * italian premier enrico letta [ won a confidence vote this week ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24367509 ) after a last-minute u-turn by former pm silvio berlusconi . 
  this political defeat has shown that berlusconi does n't hold a firm grip on his pdl party anymore . 
  * a romanian couple was found dead in the trunk of a car left on the brink of a pier in reggio calabria . 
  a man involved with a prostitution ring was later arrested for the murder . 
  * an alitalia airplane that could n't deploy its landing gears did an emergency landing in rome ; there were no casualties among the 151 passengers on board .

  her accomplice has been tried in cuba . 
  * a man who fired some shots against his former wife 's house was killed in a firefight with a carabinieri patrol in la spezia this morning . 
  * ten children , aged 11 to 12 , were injured ( two seriously ) after falling from a moving backhoe they were riding during a birthday party held in a quarry in lombardy . 
  the driver of the backhoe was allegedly the father of one of the children . 
  * [ giuliano gemma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giuliano_gemma ) , an actor who gained his fame in the '60s by featuring in several `` spaghetti western '' movies , died this week in a car crash . 
  italian news sites report that shipwreck survivors have been charged with illegal immigration . 
  this is bullshit . 
  berlusconi is just the tip of the iceberg , our problems are n't going to magically disappear when he leaves . 
  we have an entrenched and self-serving bureaucracy that is at the same time hugely expensive and a hindrance to competitiveness ; we have ineffective regulated professions that are sheltered from competition ; clueless politician that are just puppets in the hands of high-ranking bureaucrats ... until this changes , we wo n't be competitive , berlusconi or not . 
  this issue has the potential to bring down the entire schengen agreement : if the migration flows increase , i think we 'll have border checks again within the eu by the next 10-15 years . 
  i know . 
  i was just pointing out that the rbs bailout was one of the biggest in history , and that rbs is a uk bank . 
  rules in italy are always flexible . 
  yes , but $ 50 are much more common than $ 100 . 
  i would n't forget [ royal bank of scotland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_royal_bank_of_scotland_group ) , whose bailout cost the uk taxpayers # 45 billion in 2008 and 2009 ( the state still owns an 81 % stake in the bank ) . 
  italians rely on cash for their payments , especially for small purchases . 
  you need to insert your national health service smartcard to certify your age . 
  yes , why ? 
  i stand corrected then , thank you . 
  i saw this in leiden , and the phenomenon does not appear to be unknown to other observers : http://dutchculture.wordpress.com/2011/11/07/no-curtain-rule/ maybe it 's one of those small things only outsiders notice ? 
  personal experience .
