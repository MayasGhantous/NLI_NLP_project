  we have organized crime in italy , and mobsters have always killed each other , but i would n't say that two murders in a week are a crime wave of shootings , considering also the size of italy 's population ( 61 million ) . 
  moreover , the authorities were searching gypsy camps because someone with connections in the criminal underworld told them he heard the girls were there , not because gypsyies are automatically suspected of any random crime . 
  indeed the president of the italian republic wields real power : among other things , he can appoint the prime minister and dissolve the chambers , calling for new elections . 
  he was the mastermind behind the monti and letta governments . 
  he wanted to retire in february , but the parties could n't find an agreement on his successor , so he was re-elected for another 7-year term . 
  some random stuff that came up to my mind : * the dutch golden age in the 17th century gave the world artists like rembrandt and vermeer , but also the stock market , the limited liability corporation , and the first modern financial bubble ( the black tulip bubble ) . 
  * the rijkmuseum in amsterdam is one of the best in the world ; personally , i could spend a week exploring it . 
  * the dutch were the first europeans to settle in new york ( then new amsterdam ) in the 17th century ; what remains today of that period are some names of places of dutch origins ( harlem , stuyvesant , bronx , brooklyn ... ) . 
  * ~ ~ dutch houses are often without curtains at their windows ~ ~ window curtains in dutch houses are often left open , but peeking inside is considered rude . 
  * the pennsylvania `` dutch '' in the united states really are `` deutsch '' . 
  * the dutch like to joke about the belgians , sometimes even in international contexts where the humor is lost in translation . 
  they are never discussed , as far as i know . 
  but you can always ask italian redditors what they think about centrist parties directly in / r/italy , if you want . 
  in other news : * a delivery van hit a column in padua when maneuvering , sending to the ground the 13th century statue of a lion ( or cat , as the popular opinion said ) that was standing on top of it . 
  the statue shattered in hundreds of fragments . 
  * the brother of a former president of atalanta fc was shot several times in bergamo , in what looked like a mafia-style execution . 
  * a 30-year old man was shot to the head five times in rome , another assassination that seems related to the capital 's organized crime . 
  * still in bergamo , thugs fired automatic weapons against the windows of a bar . 
  nobody was injured . 
  * a jeweler in sicily [ scared away a couple of armed robbers by threatening them with his gun and literally kicking their asses out of his store ] ( http://mediaset.vitv.it/notizie.virgilio.it/vvms_409100?ref=notizie.virgilio.it ) . 
  * three women were killed this week in different occasions by their current or former male partners , events that get relevant coverage in the italian media , that have even coined a neologism , `` femminicidio '' , to refer to murders of women . 
  * the costa concordia cruise ship has been raised . 
  there were initially claims that the remains of two of the victims were found , but later it turned out they were just animal bones . 
  * authorities were fruitlessly searching several gypsy camps in sardinia for [ two swiss young girls ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disappearance_of_alessia_and_livia_schepp ) , disappeared in 2011 . 
  the father of the girls took them with him for the weekend when the girls disappeared , and then committed suicide in italy . 
  he left a note claiming he had killed the girls . 
  their bodies were never found . 
  italian redditors are not representative of the italian electorate . 
  according to a survey we did in r/italy , the vast majority of italian redditors are either left-leaning or m5s ( 5 stars movement ) voters , so you are n't likely to find comments in favour of berlusconi here . 
  his party however has been doing very well recently in the opinion polls , and that could explain why berlusconi decided to pull the plug and end the letta government . 
  going to elections twice in the same year would set an unprecedented record of political instability even for italy . 
  my italian grandmother , who experienced german occupation in northeastern italy ( that was annexed to the third reich as the adriatisches k\u00fcstenland ) used to say exactly the same . 
  \u010cesk\u00e1 zbrojovka manufactures the best handguns in europe ( sorry , beretta ) . 
  extremely reliable and precise . 
  it was like this before silvio , and it will be the same after he 'll be gone . 
  have you ever paid a bribe ? 
   also , corruption at every level ( a friend of mine who works at the land registry tells me every form you have to compile comes with a precise bribery price , established since decades and fluctuating with inflation ; not paying it means your form sits there forever ) ... what is the current rate for a real estate transfer of ownership ? 
  empty spaces . 
  oh no , they were definitely smaller !, 
  about the size of a german shepherd dog . 
  it was night , but yes , they had big tails . 
  you may be right . 
  i 'm not familiar with wildlife . 
  i did n't know there were no lynx in london then , so i did n't think much about it . 
  in august i saw two big cats , maybe two lynxes , in an alley in a london suburb at night . 
  they stared at me for about a minute , then they went back to a wooded area . 
  not being familiar with england 's wildlife , only now do i realized how out of the ordinary that encounter was . 
  edit : i guess they were foxes . 
  i thought they were smaller , but i had never encountered a fox before . 
  i was [ here ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/rmdpq ) on aug. 8 at 11pm . 
  nothing to report then . 
  i went to bergen once . 
  i can confirm it 's the rainiest city in europe , 
  at the beginning the grammar is simple : no cases , no genders , almost no verb conjugations ... at a more advanced level things become more difficult ( subjunctive , hypothetical sentences ) . 
  the most difficult parts for me were phrasal verbs and pronunciation . 
  especially pronunciation , because of the non-phonetic nature of the english spelling . 
  spoken english is a bitch , and understanding native speakers may be frustrating at times . 
  nothing gets more french and more '80s than [ caroline loeb ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidxttlq2ym ) . 
  ( i 'm not particularly proud to confess that i owned a single 45 rpm record of this song ) . 
  yeah , i forgot about toto cutugno , i guess he was n't exactly on my `` memory lane '' . 
  he was popular , but i 'm learning now that he might have been even more popular outside italy . 
  i do n't claim to be a beer expert , and i did n't imply that you should avoid it at all costs . 
  i simply do n't think that peroni is anything special : just another mass produced lager . 
  glad i 've never heard about vis then !, 
  i 'll avoid it if i find it . 
  i love paulaner wei\u00dfbier , i 'm glad to see my beer tastes endorsed by a german , 
  staropramen is just great , and it 's the beer i have bought more frequently in the last 3 years . 
  also good . 
  la\u0161ko zlatorog is the best , in my opinion . 
  most popular : [ peroni nastro azzurro ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peroni_brewery ) . 
  it 's not particularly good , but i heard that they inexplicably managed to market themselves at premium prices outside italy . 
  best one : the best beers are produced locally by dozens of small - and microbreweries and so they are n't distributed everywhere . 
  the best beer brewed at an industrial scale , in my opinion , is [ menabrea ] ( http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/birra_menabrea ) . 
  was n't falco an austrian ? 
  thank you for this post , compiling this random list of italian hits from the '80s was a nice walk down memory lane : 1 .

  gruppo italiano - [ tropicana ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psydohbcij8 ) ( 1983 ), 
  the po ' boys i had in new orleans were delicious indeed . 
  are they common just in the south ? 
  i have never seen them elsewhere in the united states . 
  we do n't have a perfect equivalent in italy , as far as i know . 
  i 'd call it a panino . 
  i 'm not a sammarinese but i know the republic well , because of frequent trips there over the last 15 years for work reasons ( 6-8 trips per year ) . 
  in my opinion , they do n't have an interest to join the eu , because they fear they 'd lose their tax and banking advantages . 
  however , the italian government in the last 3 years has seriuosly limited those advantages , by means of more thorough investigations and trials for tax fraud that affected many italian citizens that use san marino as a tax haven . 
  so they are currently experiencing a crisis in their business model ; it is difficult to tell wether this could lead to a change of mind in the sammarinese population . 
  impossible , guns are illegal in britain . 
  italy i suggest [ il mestiere delle armi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozm4hdrk55s ) ( the profession of arms ) , 2001 . 
  it 's a about the end of chivalry and the introduction of modern warfare in renaissance italy . 
  ermanno olmi 's movie tells the last six days of the giovanni de medici 's ( nicknamed giovanni dalle bande nere ) life . 
  son of giovanni di pierfrancesco de medici , from the distinguished florentine family , and caterina sforza , daughter of the duke of milan galeazzo maria , he was a famous captain and soldier of fortune and the most excellent knight , famous throughout all europe for his courage , his skill with weapons and abilities as a strategist . 
  he died in 1526 at 28 , from a wound caused by a falconet , a newly devised artillery piece , first notable man to die killed by this weapon .
