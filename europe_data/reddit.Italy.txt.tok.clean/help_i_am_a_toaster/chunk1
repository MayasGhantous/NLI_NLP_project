dude , just no . 
  do n't make endl\u00f6sung jokes with germans !, 
  do you know why all italians are short ? 
  because our mothers said we have to get a job when we grow up . 
  *** how do you make an italian shut up ? 
  you tie his arms behind his back . 
  *** how do you spot a northern italian at a cock fight ? 
  he 's the one betting on the duck . 
  how do you know a southern italian is there too ? 
  the duck wins, 
  that 's the joke . 
  ^ but ^ our ^ olive ^ oil ^ is ^ better . 
  i can confirm the secret fear of aircon , at least in some situations . 
  try to get in and out of your car repeatedly on a hot summer day . 
  i have fucking penguins in my car in summer , and i 'm sure it 's unhealthy , but whatever , i 'm sure i 'll die from something else . 
  for the rest , drafts do n't do no harm , and wet hair is even kinda comfortable in summer . 
  yeah , i wanted to keep things simple , but you 're right . 
  or ~ ~ germans ~ ~ * austrians * dressed up as ~ ~ polish ~ ~ * serbian * soldiers attacking a ~ ~ german ~ ~ * austrian * radio station . 
  they would 've found another . 
  christ , they would have invented one , if necessary . 
  no , it 's like saying that if you kill your neighbour , and a country takes this as a pretext to start a war which was already pretty inevitable in any case , you are to blame for the killing of your neighbour , not for the whole effing war . 
  thank you . 
  this explains a lot . 
  go away , big american corporation . 
  someone can explain what 's * really * confirmed ? 
  i 've read several articles stating this , others debunking this and others again debunking the refuting ones . 
  i 'm a tad confused . 
  oh god , not me ( sadly ) , the italian debt per capita . 
  i 'm a poor toaster . 
  yeah , sorry , forgot a link . 
  thanks . 
  as long as media and populist parties keep calling it an invasion . . nobody cares to do the math . 
  and nobody cares that of the 5m immigrants we have in italy at the moment , something like 30 % come from romania and albania alone , not africa/middle east . 
  ^ 44k ^ here . 
  we have spizzico , they sell - * what a surprise * - pizza . 
  not that good , it 's the most greasy stuff available outside from mcdonald 's , but not * that * bad if you 're in a hurry . 
  arguable . 
  i think ( iirc , in case feel free to correct me ) the line is drawn according to the roots . 
  if the language evolved from the so called italian vulgars ( neolatin regional languages ) it 's a dialect of italian . 
  if the language evolved from latin directly ( for example sardinian or furlan/friulan ) or from another language ( german , greek ) it 's a proper language . 
  true , it was an example based on my own experience . 
   trentino i ca n't even understand my own grandparents when they speak `` tight '' . 
  but not to germany . 
  no , the map is really about italian dialects in the country . 
  thus regions like sardinia , friuli , south tyrol and others are in grey , because in those places the majority speaks truly different languages ( sardinian , german dialects , etc ) rather than dialects of italian . 
  the wiki article linked [ above ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bi5k9/italian_dialects/csmb9gy?context=3 ) contains the actual map of * all * the languages and dialects spoken in italy . 
  yes , it has more in common with catalan rather than italian , iirc . 
  i do n't know if german soldiers used vulgar latin . 
  i know that vulgar/spoken latin was used by the broad masses , in opposition to the written latin used by the literate/for official documents . 
  vulgar latin mixed/formed the various local dialects , which became the different types of so called italian vulgars . 
  * edit : a letter . 
  first of all , italy was split up in bazillions of different states until the end of the 19th century , each developing his own version of italian from `` vulgar '' italian ( think of it as latin for peasants ) . 
  then , once unified , it developed in 2 `` macroregions '' , an industrial one in the north , and a rural/agricultural one in the south , with not much exchange between the both . 
  the biggest differences can still be seen on a north-south scale . 
  not having a unified language for centuries until 150 years ago , together with the fact that there was no necessity until late to learn proper italian outside from school for the most ( outside from the big cities/industrial regions ) , pretty much did the trick . 
  there sure are other reasons , and maybe someone more into the matter can give better insight , but this is what first comes to my mind . 
  * e : reread your question , there is something to add :  do italians not move very much or consume mass media that exposes them to other dialects ? 
  no , there is no necessity in using your dialect with everyone , since we still have common italian to interact , so the dialects are mostly used at home , with friends from the same roots . 
  and mass media are ( with small exceptions ) all in `` proper '' italian , so you are n't that much exposed to regional dialects apart from your own . 
  great . 
  now the germans will build one too . 
  not all , or at least not easily . 
  as a rule of thumb you can say that the further you go away from tuscany/central italy , the more are the differences between the local dialect and italian and the harder it is to understand , with bigger increasing going southwards . 
  i , for example , have a hard time understanding even single words south of rome . 
  as long as they do n't grexit also the schengen treaty , you should be able to cross borders as usual , maybe with some more border controls like it happens in switzerland . 
  first of all austria seeking revenge for the esc . 
  yeah , let 's close the a22 , they 're all coming through there . 
  not that there is much left to close , with all the roadworks . 
  i wonder how long it will take for them to declare war on nk and lil ' kim to go full psycho against is in response . 
   which is the westernmost capital city of ** continental ** europe ? 
  the original question . 
  oh , i did n't even realize . 
  shit , i always forget russia . 
  do n't forget about malta . 
  i know quite some who could be classified as dicks . 
   * also got ta love how you 're going to go `` you got sources for that ??? 
  huh ??? '', 
  for every single word i post now . 
  * maybe somebody is * really * interested in further readings about this ? 
  asking for sources is the best way to get them , as it is clear that you as op should be able to provide them more easily/quickly than a random google-search , since * you * brought out the argument . 
  maybe if we stop taking everything so personal so fast , we can get a great discussion out of threads like this one . 
   price range - assorted add 50 % for uk . 
  oh , i thought this was an italian thing . 
  i 'm somehow glad it 's more universal . 
  request for a greek referendum megathread ? 
  merc\u00ed .

  referendum about * what * ? 
  if you do n't mind my stupid question . 
  you know what , i like you for your opinion . 
  and for your choice of drinks . 
  * * please , drink lots of water before going to bed . 
  confirmed ? 
  opposed . 
  i ( * we * ) know . 
  and sending out frontex with only half of the budget the italian navy/coast guard had is n't very effective either . 
  any further readings on this ? 
  none besides the almighty me . 
  i need my pitchfork . 
  yes , i like it too .
