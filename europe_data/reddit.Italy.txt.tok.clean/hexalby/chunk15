  and have you seen their pizzas ? 
  my heart can take only so much . 
  see !, 
  it was n't our fault !, 
  i think ... 
  ah do n't worry , i 'm kidding . 
  there was a topic on r/italy about this some days ago where we jokingly discussed this . 
  considering how much shit i 'm seeing lately i 'm starting to think r/sweden and r/italy are at war, 
  naahh , i would have chosen another city though . 
  oh it 's my fault do n't worry !, 
  what 's wrong with breakfast btw ? 
  it ai n't perfect either, 
  so you 're saying that china is the economical colossus that is now only thanks to the lat 20 years of free market ? 
  the decades of mass industrialization under planned economy absolutely did nothing ? 
  that 's not soci ... you know what ? 
  i give up . 
  keep r/europe , i 'll go to r/fullcommunism, 
  ohhhhhhhhhhhh !, 
  oh i meant it as a joke as well ... 
  i forgot the / s i mean you can joke about our economy , unemployment ... 
  such is life in the zone, 
  dude ... update your jokes, 
  i think the idea is that is not only tasteless , but also aestethically tasteless, 
  ahahaha , bravo sir , well played . 
  was that music really necessary ? 
  do n't you mean molise ? 
  what do you have for kurwa in mexico ? 
  oh come on mate !, 
  i was hoping to start some flames here !, 
  ohhh you 're no fun ( just kidding btw ), 
  no , it 's an alternative to 4 months of jail , the italian law says that to avoi dthat you can pay a fine correspondent to 250 euros per day, 
  this . 
  i do n't know how much do you know of italian history , but the cold war period was pretty bloody for us , domestic terrorism of both extremes of the political spectrum was commonplace , so the laws protecting public administration buildings became stricter with time . 
  it had nothing to do with religion though , it was a matter of security, 
  it 's a matter of security . 
  this was not a simple building , it was the city council with the city administration present , mayor included . 
  the law requires citizens to not cover their faces in buildings used by public administration and it 's a pretty sensible request . 
  do remember that italy suffered tremendously of domestic terrorism during the cold war between left and right wing extremists , so we are a bit strict with security regulations for public officers . 
  this is not `` an example '' , an italian would have had the same fine . 
  https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanzioni_sostitutive_delle_pene_detentive_brevi to put it simply you can be jailed for x months in this case or pay a fine equivalent to 250 euros per day . 
  because that way she can be identified and later apprehended ? 
  or you mean that you would gladly work with your coworker completely covered in black ? 
  this is not about religion !, 
  the woman could have been a spaghetti flying monster believer and she would still be fined, 
  they were n't built yesterday ... and they 're often monitored . 
  it 's not even that unique as a position , like [ this ] ( http://monkeysandmountains.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lichtenstein-castle-best.jpg ) one , and [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b8/95/2c/b8952cedefb3ce4c4124241d0449e405--amazing-photos-mike-dantoni.jpg ) . 
  you think the nazis put genocide in their manifesto ? 
  no they presented themselves as the rational alternative . 
  there was nothing extreme in the nazi party , on the surface at least . 
  you do n't need extremists to get a dictatorship , just enough fear and complacency . 
  extremists come afterward , to consolidate power . 
  no you 're right , usually it 's the comma that separates the integers from the decimals , but studying engineering i slowly drifted towards the full stop . 
  oh you 're right . 
  thanks internet fellow !, 
  have an internet point !, 
  `` wait , it was today ? '', 
  0.01 % of albanian population, 
   people are deliberately making poor greeks suffer without reason is offensive and probably ideologically motivated . 
  a lot of wallets gain a lot of money from the greek situation . 
  the fact that such individuals hide themselves behind banks or stock markets makes little difference on the effects of their actions . 
   federal reserve chair janet yellen remarked in june that another financial crisis was unlikely `` in our lifetime . '' [ feeling of imminent ass rape rising ], 
  finland is pretty fucking metal . 
  says the guy from r/the _ donald, 
  oh god are you a bot ? 
  you 're showing the same level of critical discourse . 
  i really do n't have the energy to discuss things with someone that ca n't be bothered to research something before spewing garbage over it . 
  two things : - you can have a socialist party in power and not live in a socialist country . 
  this is because socialism represents a specific kind of organization of the means of production , not a set of policies to attach on the current system . 
  - declaring yourself socialist does not mean anything . 
  the list is literally called self declared socialists . 
  north korea calls itself the democratic republic of north korea , does that mean that democracy is to be trashed ? 
  at this point this is a meme , so i 'll fight [ fire ] ( http://i.imgur.com/esqvgph.jpg ) with [ fire ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ph5rz14.jpg ), 
  i agree , but it happens , a lot unfortunately . 
  of course it does n't help that far right parties took the socio political analysis of the left and used them to gather votes . 
  so apparently the years of austerity are not enough , let 's keep things as they are it will work eventually . 
  and these are the same people that say `` socialism never worked , stop trying '', 
  i think it 's the chance of random boasting per hour . 
  of course it was a brit to point this out !, 
  i for one welcome our new french overlords . 
  ahh the magic of international politics . 
  can somebody accidentally drop a diplomatically immune bomb in his car ? 
  i would n't call macron `` political renewal '' his policies are just another remix of classical neoliberal rethoric . 
  oh god the nazbol meme is escaping containment . 
  damn it / leftypol / i told you it would happen !, 
  pfft , amateurs . 
  oh damn you 're right . 
  universities controlled by private interests are much freerer !, 
  it 's not like they simply obey the rethoric of a different master . 
  i prefer people that admit they are not able to fully govern their life over masochists that prefer exploitation by corporations and private interest over everything . 
  it took thirty years to reach the old levels of prosperity . 
  and how is it that a decrease should be expected ? 
  i thought capitalism was perfect and could solve all the issues those pesky communists did . 
  only recently russia surpassed the ussr in [ gdp ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:soviet_union_gdp_per_capita.gif ) and [ life expectancy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/health_in_russia ) . 
  half the russian population still today think the collapse of the soviet union was [ a bad thing ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/08/soviet-empire-poll_n_5288261.html ) , even many of the ex satellite states of russia think [ the same ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gpfmp/polls_show_eastern_europeans_miss_communism/ ) . 
  and while china has not been communist for a while , the communist party is still in power and has direct control throught the state of many of thebiggest industries of the country . 
  oh i do n't think ubi would hinder overachievers , quite the contray in fact . 
  contrary to popular fables innovation is not the product of competition . 
  newton was able to formulate his laws thanks to his family that supported his studies , for example . 
  none was competing with him . 
  as i said i am a socialist , so my solution would be to abolish private property and let the workers manage the means of production .
