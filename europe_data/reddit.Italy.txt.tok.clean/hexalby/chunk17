  can you mention a single bloodless revolution ? 
   standard of living in russia today would be much greater , had the country been a democracy for 100 years . 
  do you have proof this is the case ? 
  do you have any example of a country similar to russia coming out of feudalism into capitalism where the standard of living were not abysmal for anyone outside of the elite ? 
  no you are just saying things . 
  it 's useless to speculate in this way if not counterproductive , especially if we consider a factor as democracy , which by itself is meaningless , being niether an economic system nor a political system . 
  the fact is people lived better under the communist regime than the tzarist government and for many even the current oligarchic clusterfuck . 
  oh wait i forgot . 
  we are on r/europe . 
  russia is baaaad . 
  environmental changes are not affected by mere 100 days or even a few years . 
   democracy , global stability he does n't rule alone . 
  he ca n't do anything so devasting to dismantle democracy or cause world wars . 
  if he manages to instead it means the seeds to do so were already there long ago . 
  yes that is exactly what i said . 
  i 'm a closet fascist you got me . 
  protests in the us are not as widespread and violent as what there is usually in france . 
  and not even trump can `` ban '' muslims and you knwo it . 
   because most centre and leftist parties want more police . 
  not an argument . 
  wait a year or two and you 'll see . 
  there is already a lot more red in the us than just a year ago with obama . 
  i do n't agree . 
  not voting is not stupid , but it is not legitimizing the parties running for the presidency . 
  not voting and then sitting on your ass would be complacent , but a party with a small power base with constant protests going on will have a hard time doing their dirty job . 
  and macron knows this perfectly , why do you think he wants more policemen as u/eurodittor said ? 
  you are implying though that it will remain so even with the `` lesser evil '' candidate , when in reality economic and sociopolitical trends will have a much greater impact on how things actually turn out to be . 
  you are also implying that revolutions can be only negative , while history does not support this . 
  in fact pretty much every successful revolution brought an increase in standard of living , be it the french revolution , the russian , the american ... a diseased system will eventually die out no matter how much it is reformed . 
  the roman empire managed to stay alive a few centuries more thanks to the colossal changes brought by diocletian and constantine and later justinian , but it still crumbled . 
  to use your metaphor if the house is slowly rotting away your options are to demolish it now and rebuild or try to patch it up and use it a bit more . 
  / pol / is as right wing as you can be . 
  all ~ ~ sane people ~ ~ leftists migrated to / leftypol /, 
  username kinda checks out . 
  of course the german would be interested ... can you keep a chair for us ? 
  and yet in rome women were not only allowed to have material possession but were very involved in the economy , they had the right to legal representation , could bring criminal prosecutions and defend themselves in trials and inheritance was by law equally split to the children regardless of gender . 
  it was ... rome was not a bad place at all for women compared to the rest of the ancient world . 
  it 's not like corruption is a communist exclusive . 
  not only them believe me . 
  edit : i meant russian scientists are not the only one being underpaid . 
  in fact rape comes from latin rapio , which means to kidnap . 
  sorry i just love trivia . 
  ahahahahahahahahhhhh you ca n't be serious . 
  please tell me you 're not serious . 
  this is getting kinky, 
  well i think this is part of the legacy of the soviet union , one of the few positive changes it made in russia . 
  fun fact : the stuntmen working with bud spencer said you had to be careful with him , as he would not really hold back much and he is a very strong guy . 
  you know ... it took me 20 years to see that hungary -  land of the huns ... now i feel like that time i finally understood what k-9 means . 
  ehi r/europe !, 
  i always wanted to make a little collection of trivia about venice and now i finally decided to post something . 
  i live near the once most serene republic and i was always fascinated by its history . 
  so here are some interesting facts . 
  & nbsp ; 1 - ** the origin ** : venice was founded at the beginning of the fifth century by refugees , driven out of their homes by the frequent barbarian incursions charateristic of the late roman imperial period . 
  the lagoon was a perfect place to build a fortified town , since the waters would stop any army . 
  the relative isolation of venice was a crucial advantage throughout its history . 
  & nbsp ; 2 - ** the name ** : the name venice came from the name of the tribe that originally inhabited the venetian region , the veneti . 
  the region is today still called veneto . 
  the name of the tribes comes from an old indoeuropean word that meant `` to love '' , in latin the same word was the origin of `` venus '' , name of the goddess of love , which is exactly the first thing that comes to mind thinking about the ruthless merchants of venice . 
  & nbsp ; 3 - ** the republic ** : you want to know how the city remained a republic during the middle ages ? 
  well , the main reason is ... 
  the first rulers of venice died ( assassinated ) so fast that eventually a republic controlled by the biggest merchant families was established . 
  ironically this early bloodied period gave the republic a long and stable government , while the rest of the italian city remained in a very unstable state . 
  after [ the gothic wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gothic_war_ ( 535 % e2 % 80 % 93554 ) ) venice was under the control of the byzantine empire . 
  initially the area was known as the exarchate of ravenna , with a dux controlling it . 
  later the word `` dux '' would transform in `` doge '' in venetian ( and duke in english ) . 
  venice and the byzantine empire remained in a love-hate relationship for a long time . 
  in the early period of its history venice often came to the aid of constantinople against the invading hordes . 
  the two columns standing in `` piazza san marco '' were gifted by the emperor as thanks for the invaluable help of the venetian fleet . 
  legends says that there was a third column , but was lost in the lagoon when pirates attacked the ships transporting them . 
  charlemagne tried to conquer the city and sent his son , pepin , the then king of lombardy , to siege it , but the army was ravaged by diseases and eventually pepin himself died , prompting charlemagne to sign a peace treaty with the byzantines , recognizing their sovergnity over the city . 
  in time though the byzantine empire waned and venice gained its indipendence . 
  the city 's power grew considerably , at its peak it controlled crete , cyprus , rhodes , corfu , much of the modern [ venetian region ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:the_republic_of_venice_in_the_mid-18th_century.jpg ) , dalmatia and istria . 
  & nbsp ; 3 - ** the forth crusade ** : the forth crusade and the subsequent sack of constantionople are infamous for being the decisive factor in the final defeat of the byzantine empire and both were engineered by venice to acquire new ports in the aegean and eastern mediterranean seas . 
  the [ bronze horses ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/venice_-_st._marc%27s_basilica_10.jpg ) that adorn the st. mark basilica were stolen from constantinople during the sack . 
  & nbsp ; 4 - ** the saint graal ** : according to some legends together with the horses and other important relics , venice managed to recover even the saint graal from constantinople . 
  allegedly the relic is hidden beneath the sarcophagus of saint mark . 
  several templar knights were buried in venice , strengthening the legends . 
  all of this was the basis for the role the city played in `` indiana jones and the saint graal '' . 
  & nbsp ; 5 - ** the economy ** : contrary to popular belief , trade in venice was almost entirely state driven , meaning ships , goods and sailors were paid by the republic and the revenues distributed among the ruling families of venice . 
  in contrast genoa 's trade was controlled by private merchants . 
  & nbsp ; 6 - ** ciao ** : the word `` ciao '' comes from venetian language , originally it was `` sciavo vostro '' which means '' [ i am ] your servant '' , later shortened to the modern form . 
  & nbsp ; 7 - ** ghetto ** : speaking of venetian words , `` ghetto '' comes from venice as well , it was originally the name of the jewish quarters and was later adopted in italian and other european languages . 
  we do n't exactly know where the word came from , a theory is that it comes from the gothic word `` gatwo '' , meaning street , which in german became `` gasse '' and in swedish `` gata '' . 
  & nbsp ; 8 - ** venetian cutural acceptance ** : while the `` ghetto '' was meant to segregate the jewish community , venice was rather * liberal * for its times : in the first half of its history venice was a haven for literates , philosophers and * inconvenient * intellectuals . 
  many would flee from the rest of italy to escape the papacy and venice was more than happy to spite its biggest italian rival . 
  things changed when the power of venice began to wane and the influence of the pope brought the inquisition into venetian territories as well . 
  & nbsp ; 9 - ** elena cornaro ** : one of the results of such `` openness '' was that the first woman to graduate ( from a university ) in the world was venetian , elena cornaro piscopia , though she did not study in venice but in padua ( my city ) , where she graduated in theology . 
  & nbsp ; 10 - ** casinos ** : another `` first '' venice scored are casinos , the republic built the first gambling house in the world in 1638 . 
  the word `` casino '' is , you guessed it , from italian language , its root means house and originally referred to social clubs . 
  be careful though that in modern italians `` casino '' is used to refer to brothels , while gambling houses are called `` casin\u00f2 '' . 
  & nbsp ; 11 - ** giacomo casanova ** : this popular venetian noble left a lot of literature behind , but it is most famous for its complicated and elaborate affairs with women , so much so that his name now is synomimous of womanizer . 
  his memoirs are considered one of the best sources of customs and norms of european social life . 
  during his voyages in europe he met important figures such as rousseau , voltaire , madame de pompadour , mozart , benjamin franklin , catherine ii of russia and frederick ii of prussia . 
  ironically he never realized in his life the importance of some of these individuals as he was a very conservative thinker , faithful to the established order . 
  & nbsp ; 12 - ** the `` piombi '' ** : casanova is famous also for being one of the few individuals to manage to escape from the infamous prisons of venice , named `` piombi '' , meaning [ plural ] lead , as the roof was made from that metal . 
  the `` piombi '' were the cells dedicated to noble prisoners , while the `` pozzi '' , meaning wells , were the cells dedicated to the common prisoners . 
  these were famous for the extreme conditions the inmates found themselves and the advanced techniques of torture used . 
  another interesting fact is that prisoners were not fed , but were expected to beg for food throught the narrow windows of their cells . 
  despite being a very open city , or better because of it , venice had a very strong spy network and a powerful secret police that kept the city in check . 
  & nbsp ; 13 - ** marco polo ** : another famous venetian noble is marco polo , who , while not the first european to travel to the far east , was the first to thoroughly document its voyage along the silk road in its book `` il milione '' ( the million ) .
