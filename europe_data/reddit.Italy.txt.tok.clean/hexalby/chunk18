  there is a lot of controversy on if he actually reached catai ( old name for china ) , but historians in general think he did . 
  & nbsp ; 14 - ** ca ' dario ** : finally i want to end on a ghost story . 
  there are several `` haunted '' mansions in venice , but the most famous one is ca ' dario , built in the 15th century by giovanni dario as gift to his daughter , marietta . 
  [ here ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:claude_monet_-_palazzo_dario,_venice.jpg ) you can see it painted by monet . 
  allegedly there is a curse on the building : every one of its owners either died or was brought to financial ruin . 
  in fact marietta killed herself after her husband was stabbed to death . 
  their son killed by raiders near crete . 
  a merchant then bought it from the surviving members of the family and was soon afer brought to bankruptcy . 
  recent victims are christopher lambert , who was the manager of the band `` who '' , who died overdosed in 1981 , in his last days he slept in the house of a friend , scared of the curse . 
  another famous victim was fabrizio ferrari , died in a strange car accident . 
  the most recent victim is john entwistle , original bass guitarist of the `` who '' , who died of heart attack in 2002 . 
  nowadays it is owned by an american society and open to the public . 
  & nbsp ; well this is it . 
  there is still a lot of stuff to talk about , but it came out already too long . 
  if someone finds inaccuracies i 'm more than willing to fix the mistakes . 
  i do n't pretend to be an expert . 
  far from it in fact . 
  hope you guys enjoy .

  ehi r/europe !, 
  it was pretty fun to write a little about venice , so here i am back with some juicy facts about grandpa . 
  since the roman period spans for more or less a thousand years it would be complicated and rather distracting to add dates everywhere , so consider the following information valid for the period of peak strength of the empire , that is around the second and third century . 
  & nbsp ; 1 - ** crazy emperors ** : we often hear stories about eccentric , cruel or outrageously silly emperors , but the truth is less colourful and a lot closer to our days than we think . 
  for example emperor caligula is said to have tried to make his horse a consul , cross-dressed in public and had an incestuous relationship with his sister . 
  pretty bad right ? 
  well for the most part it is propaganda put into the history books by his political adversaries . 
  the romans did this often , very often . 
  who knows why they targeted caligula , after all he only lifted the censorship over numerous books that exposed the corruption of the senators and took steps to fight that corruption . 
  this is true also for the famous nero that sang while rome burned . 
  the reality is that not only he personally intervened in the emergency operations , but used his villa to house the homeless citizens . 
  his political adversaries though used the occasion to strike at him . 
  i wonder why , after all he only wanted to give independence to greece , for which he had great fondness . 
  on the horse consul thing it has to be said that it probably was an act by emperor caligula to denigrate his political enemies . 
  by giving such a prestigious seat to his horse he was saying the other senators where less deserving of it than an animal . 
  pretty ballsy move if you ask me . 
  now it does sound a lot more logical than the silly little facts written in the books to amuse the students during history class , right ? 
  and also eerily similar to how political propaganda of today works . 
  & nbsp ; 2 - ** damnatio memoriae ** : the romans had an interesting method of punishments for certain crimes such as high treason . 
  it consisted in erasing a person from history . 
  his praenomen ( first name ) would be cancelled in any official documents , his statues modified , his property seized , his literary production burned , even the currency he coined would be modified to erase his name . 
  it sounds like a really orwellian practice , but it was fairly common in ancient civilizations and even today to a lesser extend is practised . 
  for obvious reasons we do n't know if the practice did work or how often it was used , but we know of some people that were condemned to it , but survived . 
  for example our two friends mentioned earlier , caligula and nero , had their names erased from public monuments and official documents . 
  the best example however is probably , as u/solistrum suggested , [ geta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:severan_dynasty_-_tondo.png ) who was murdered by his brother and then condemn to be forgotten by histori . 
  & nbsp ; 3 - ** salt ** : it is often said that in ancient times , salt was as valuable as gold , while the truth is it was n't , not by a long shot . 
  what it is true though is that the trade of salt was one of the most profitable , as salt was in extremely high demand . 
  & nbsp ; 4 - ** economy ** : it is estimated the gdp of the roman empire to be at around 26 billion usd ( 1990 ) which was more or less the same of the chinese empire of the same period . 
  the gdp per capita though was around $ 857 , which was more or less double the chinese one of $ 450 . 
  today the empire would be in position 179 right after niger . 
  ( though it is not a very significant comparison as gdp heavily favours industrial production ) what i found most impressive of the roman economy was its metal production . 
  annually it produced 82,500 tons of iron , 15,000 tons of copper , 80,000 tons of lead , 200 tons of silver and 9 tons of gold . 
  production of this magnitude was surpassed only with the industrial revolution . 
  ( except for iron production which greatly benefited from later processing techniques . ), 
  another interesting fact about roman economy was the distribution of wealth : the 1.5 % of the population , the upper class , had more or less 25 % of the wealth , 10 % of the population had another 25 % and the remainder 50 % was in the poorer 88 % of the population . 
  compared to recent figures wealth was actually quite distributed , thought in ancient times land had a far greater value than financial capacity . 
  & nbsp ; 5 - ** preferences ** : from what it is understood from erotic art , ancient romans were ass guys , while ancient greeks were boob guys . 
  gon na leave it there . 
  & nbsp ; 6 - ** ufos ** : put on your tin foils hats !, 
  as it turns out seeing strange unidentified objects in the sky is something humans like to do regardless of the year on the calendar . 
  ufos sighting were documented during the roman empire , for example in 218 bc , a written account reports that a fleet of gleaming ships appeared to be floating in the sky of rome . 
  in 90 bc `` a globe of fire , of golden colour , fell to the earth , gyrating . 
  it then seemed to increase in size , rose from the earth , and ascended into the sky , where it obscured the disc of the sun , with its brilliance . 
  it revolved towards the eastern quadrant of the sky '' . 
  another one , from 150 ad : `` a beast like a piece of pottery about one hundred feet in size , multicoloured on top and shooting out fiery rays , landed in a dust cloud . '' well now i 'm not paranoid at all . 
  & nbsp ; 7 - ** werewolves ** : in roman folklore werewolves were not only present , but pretty common . 
  even in the myth of the foundation of rome romulus and remus were nursed by a she-wolf hybrid . 
  generally the metamorphosis from human to animal form occurred as a direct result of divine punishment . 
  pliny the elder described the lycanthropic shape shifting of a man into a wolf by the gods following an act of cannibalism and ovid wrote metamorphoses in which king lycaon ( from whom we get the term ` lycanthrope ' ) offended the gods by serving them human flesh . 
  his punishment was being transformed into a wolf so he could continue his disgusting eating habits . 
  by the way metamorphoses is actually a very interesting and fun read . 
  & nbsp ; 8 - ** vampires ** : ok , i 'm stretching things a bit here but bear with me , romans did not have a mythological monster similar to the modern vampire , but they had the strix , a monster with the shape of a nocturnal bird such as an owl ( which is the meaning of strix ) , who could transform into a beautiful woman that allured young men and children and ate their flesh and blood . 
  later the strix would heavily influence the strigoi , romanian mythological monsters that were described as reanimated corpses that feed on human blood and attacked their living family . 
  the myth of the strigoi would then provide the base for the modern vampire . 
  & nbsp ; 9 - ** shopping malls and fast food ** : everyone love shopping malls , right ? 
  loud noises , obnoxious music , ads everywhere , your girlfriend/sister/mother / friend that uses you like a pack mule . 
  well , you can thank the romans for inventing them . 
  the first ever shopping all was in fact built in rome by trajan in 200 ad , 60 , 000 m \u00b2 in size , with 150 separate rooms in addition to the open market area . 
  though impressive for its times , now it would not be even in the top 100 biggest malls . 
  truly society has come a long way since then . 
  furthermore , since a good portion of houses lacked kitchens , food was usually bought and eaten on the fly by the common man . 
  there were thousands of `` take away '' restaurants in rome to service the working people . 
  & nbsp ; 10 - ** concrete ** : if you are a fan of ancient rome this should not be a surprise , since romans were pretty obsessed with civil engineering , while ancient greeks were more in line with modern architects . 
  this is probably the origin of the bromance/rivalry ( brovalry ? ), 
  between the two civilization . 
  romans used concrete and cement very often . 
  a pretty good example is the pantheon , which is to date the biggest concrete dome without metal reinforcements . 
  & nbsp ; 11 - ** education and literacy ** : the sterotype of uneducated masses in the past is only partially true . 
  greeks and romans actually considered education extremely important . 
  the elite was very well educated . 
  the schooling system was based on the greek one and not to far away form ours . 
  schools were financed by paying students and divided in tiers , though one would pass from one to another through skill rather than age . 
  even poor families would send their children to get a basic education as it was considered a social obligation for the pater familias ( the `` father of the family '' , head of the roman family ) to educate his children , both boys and girls . 
  of course the cost linked to high tiers of education and the competitive structure of the schooling system kept the lower classes bound to only low levels of education . 
  surprisingly it was fairly common for even slaves to get basic education , even the ones employed in menial labor . 
  as a result literacy levels were quite high , even among slaves . 
  this fact is supported by the huge number of graffiti written all over the roman city of pompei , written and meant to be read by low class citizens . 
  & nbsp ; 12 - ** women in rome ** : despite popular belief that ancient times were hell on earth for women , roman society was surprisingly egalitarian compared to many other past societies . 
  that said they were still far away from true equality . 
  here are some examples of what is believed only modern progressive policies : - not only did roman women were allowed to have material possession , wealth , land , etc.
