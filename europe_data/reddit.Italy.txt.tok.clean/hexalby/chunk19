  but they were extremely involved in the economy . 
  they worked their estates , invested their funds , lent and borrowed . 
  we know of one woman among cicero 's creditors , and two among his debtors , for examples . 
  - inheritance was equally distributed between sons and daughters . 
  it was actually enforced by law to euqally distribute inheritance between children regardless of gender and age . 
  if such thing was not respected the child had the right to dispute the will of the deceased . 
  - women had the right to legal representation , could bring criminal prosecutions and defend themselves in trials . 
  - divorce was relatively common ( especially in the upper class ) and shame free . 
  a man or woman could end a marriage simply because he or she wanted to , and for no other reason . 
  contrary to today though , unless the wife could prove the spouse was worthless , the husband kept the children . 
  - there were rather strict laws against domestic abuse and it was considered culturally unacceptable . 
  plutarch wrote : '' [ ... ] the man who struck his wife or child , laid violent hands on the holiest of holy things '' . 
  - similarly rape was recognised as a separate crime and severely punished . 
  the victim was not considered guilty even in otherwise unlawful circumstances ( like adultery ) . 
  like domestic abuse it was considered a foul action . 
  protection from rape was even granted to non citizens except when a city was taken in an armed assault . 
  slaves were not protected however , since slaves lacked legal personhood and so none could be prosecuted because of actions carried agaisnt them . 
  furthermore rape did not have a temporal limitation , like adultery , which had to be prosecuted within 5 years . 
  rape was a capital crime . 
  - bonus fact : rape was called `` stuprum '' from which the italian `` stupro '' comes , the english word rape comes instead from `` rapio '' which means kidnapping . 
  - female gladiators existed , but were fairly uncommon . 
  their lives though differed very little from their male counterparts . 
  - despite all of this thought women had two big prohibitions : they could not vote or participate in political affairs and could not join the army . 
  despite this women with considerable political power existed , just like in the middle ages , but their power existed and was used only behind the scenes .

  so here we are , talking again about the roman empire in all its weirdness . 
  hope you like this compilation as well r/europe !, 
  as the other list , consider the following true for the imperial era , though some might be valid for the republican period as well . 
  & nbsp ; 1 - ** height ** : from the skeletons of pompeii it was calculated that the average height for women was 155 cm ( 5 ' 1 '' ) and 166 cm ( 5 ' 5 '' ) for men . 
  also we know from found documents that the minimum for soldiers was 165 cm , but the average height of a legionnaire was around 170 cm . 
  pretty tall considering that just a few generations ago we were as tall if not shorter . 
  there is the stereotype that barbarians were much taller than the romans and this was born by the emphasis of some latin writers put on the height and the strength of the barbarians they faced , but the archaeological findings do not support this thesis , so it might that the big bad barbarians were simply boasting . 
  that said there was probably some difference in favour of the barbarian tribes , since relying less on agriculture and more on meat and animal products would have made them taller , that difference though was probably small , likely around 2-3 inches or 4-8 cm taller and for the most part limited to the elite warrior class . 
  we often underestimate greatly the height of past civilizations . 
  aristophanes , a greek writer , wrote about some heroic six footers ( which in modern times would be around 6 ' 1 '' or 185 cm ) in his comedy `` the frogs '' and nero was said to have formed a 6 foot only legion . 
  so 180 cm of height was considered quite rare and pretty impressive , but not freakish . 
  & nbsp ; 2 - ** de gustibus non est disputandum ** : culinary wars are not an exclusive of modern italians , today we argue between pandoro and panettone , during the roman empire ( and still today ) we argued between butter and oil . 
  being a mediterranean civilization the romans were used to olive oil , while butter was used by the tribes that inhabited gallia cisalpina ( gaul our side of the alps , today north italy ) . 
  when caesar was invited to eat in the home of valerio leone , in the modern milanese region , he found that his generals were less than enthusiastic of the dish of asparagus served with butter offered to them . 
  at that point he pronounced the now famous phrase `` tastes ca n't be discussed '' , sighing resigned . 
  & nbsp ; 3 - ** sewers demons ** : romans used public open latrines to satisfy their biological needs , but these buildings got in time a bad reputation , as it happened that some of the toilets exploded . 
  this happens ( very rarely ) also today and is related to methane build up in the pipes and/or sewers . 
  furthermore rats lived in numbers in the sewers and there was the risk that one would take advantage of the sitting roman and have a taste . 
  with time stories of demons living in the sewers grew in popularity and number , so much so that depictions of the goddess [ fortuna ] ( http://imgur.com/uxehjof ) ( luck ) on the walls . 
  with all this said latrines were still widely used and exploding toilets or brave rats were regarded more as funny rumors or urban legends , rather than real threats . 
  the presence of the goddess of luck was because , legend or not , romans were a very superstitious people and preferred to be safe rather than sorry . 
  another urban legend related to the cloaca maxima ( the sewers of rome ) is that something lived down there , something big and dangerous . 
  an octopus . 
  claudius aelianus wrote in his book `` de natura animalium '' ( the nature of animals ) that the creature came out of the sewers at night in search for garum , the famous roman fish based sauce . 
  so yeah , the roman version of the giant alligator in the sewers was an octopus with a taste for fermented fish innards . 
  & nbsp ; 4 - ** pizza ** : the modern pizza was created in the 16 ^ th century in naples , but there are examples of simple versions similar to today focaccia ( a type of flatbread ) from the time of the roman empire . 
  a legend suggests that roman soldiers gained a taste for jewish matzoth while stationed in palestine and developed a similar food after returning home , adding cheese and olive oil . 
  however a recent archaeological discovery has found a preserved similar food from the bronze age in the venetian region , so the question is still very open . 
  & nbsp ; 5 - ** pasta ** : the earlier mentions of pasta are of the 3 ^ rd century , thought something very similar was maybe used a century earlier . 
  dried pasta instead was created by the arabs , in the 5 ^ th century , adapting pasta for the desert . 
  but what about noodles ? 
  who invented them ? 
  was it us ? 
  the chinese ? 
  the soviet ? 
  the earliest mentions of noodles in china are of the 2 ^ nd century , so they may have barely beaten us , but it is very likely that the noodles were actually independently developed by the two civilizations . 
  china did not go further , however , because at the time it lacked durum wheat . 
  & nbsp ; 6 - ** actors ** : contrary to today , actors were not praised and considered celebrities , quite the opposite in fact , they were considered borderline `` infames '' ( social outcasts ) , almost at the same level of prostitutes . 
  this went as far as priest preaching to the elite not to go see plays so not to give them the prestige derived from their presence . 
  despite this however theatre was a big part of ancient rome entertainment , with thousands of plebeian attending the plays in the numerous theatres of the city . 
  the reason for this stigma is because the plays were often vulgar , sexually explicit and often criticized the status quo of society , so with time a negative stigma accumulated over this once noble profession . 
  to summarize roman society adored politicians and had nothing but contempt for actors . 
  exactly like today where politicians are hated and actors are placed on pedestals . 
  & nbsp ; 7 - ** lacus curtis ** : there is a special spot in the roman forum , called lacus curtis , which was a hole in the ground , later covered . 
  livy tells however that during the monarchical period it was a deep and widening chasm , that connected the city to hades , the realm of pluto , menacing to bring rome with it into the dark abyss . 
  the citizens tried to fill the chasm , but to no avail . 
  an oracle revealed that the city would be spared only if it was thrown the thing which rome held dearest . 
  marcus curtius , a young equites ( knight ) , understanding that it was its young soldiers what rome cared most about , threw himself with his horse and the city was saved . 
  an earlier version of the story of lacus curtis is that a sabine horseman fell into it , while chased by romulus during the war of the rape of the sabine women . 
  my personal opinion is that there was a hole , someone , maybe on a horse , fell into it and embarrassed by the situation came up with a nice story . 
  but that 's just a theory . 
  & nbsp ; 8 - ** pricks , everywhere ** : romans were obsessed with dicks . 
  in latin there are 120 different ways to refer to male genitalia . 
  in pompeii there are phallic representations everywhere . 
  on the streets , on the walls pointing towards good prostitues , on statues , on ornaments . 
  the most common charm against magic , the evil eye or envy was the [ fascinus ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:amulettes_phalliques_gallo-romaines_mus%c3%a9e_saint-remi_120208.jpg ) , which was typically a phallic symbol in bronze or lead ( now you know where the word fascination comes from ) . 
  the god priapus was the god of male genitalia and sported a [ huge permanent erection ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:pompeya_er%c3%b3tica6.jpg ) ( kinda nsfw ) . 
  and you people were bothered by a couple of dick pics . 
  & nbsp ; 9 - ** sexuality ** : ancient rome was a patriarchy , so the most important traits someone had to have were those considered masculine : self control and self reliance ( temperantia and prudentia ) , justice ( iustitia ) and courage ( fortitudo ) were the four pillars of virtus ( virtue ) . 
  the word virtus itself comes from the word for man , `` vir '' . 
  sexuality of ancient rome was heavily influenced by these cardinal values . 
  - as you probably guessed in section 8 , male genitalia were almost sacred , so there were several laws to protect them . 
  for example castration was outlawed by domitian in the 1 ^ st century and circumcision was criminalized in the 4 ^ th century , slaves subjected to it were freed by law . 
  the only exception were jews and egyptian priests , which were allowed to keep practising circumcision . 
  both practices were regarded as barbaric and cruel . 
  roman surgeons knew how to restore the foreskin of the penis with an operation called epispasm . 
  - the words for testicles and witness , `` testes '' and `` testis '' , are very similar .
