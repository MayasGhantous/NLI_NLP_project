  this is because in the early days of the republic , witnesses used to swear on their testicles , symbolizing that `` the bearing of false witness brings a curse upon not only oneself , but one 's house and future line '' . 
  the modern word testicles comes from the diminutive of `` testes '' , `` testiculus '' . 
  - homosexuality was accepted and relatively common , but roman men were required to assume the active role in order not to loose their masculinity . 
  this was the product of the mentality of mastery over their own body , part of the `` libertas '' ( freedom ) that distinguished a free man from a slave . 
  it is only under justinian and with christianity that homosexuality becomes a crime . 
  - latin had such a wealth of words for men outside the masculine norm that some scholars argue for the existence of a homosexual subculture in rome . 
  - the exception was among soldiers , where homosexual behaviour was strictly limited . 
  the reason for this was simply to maintain discipline between the troops . 
  plutarch tells of a good-looking young recruit named trebonius , which had been sexually harassed over a period of time by his superior officer , who happened to be marius 's nephew , gaius luscius . 
  one night , having fended off unwanted advances on numerous occasions , trebonius was summoned to luscius 's tent . 
  unable to disobey the command of his superior , he found himself the object of a sexual assault and drew his sword , killing luscius . 
  a conviction for killing an officer typically resulted in execution . 
  when brought to trial , he was able to produce witnesses to show that he had repeatedly had to fend off luscius , and `` had never prostituted his body to anyone , despite offers of expensive gifts . '', 
  marius not only acquitted trebonius in the killing of his kinsman , but gave him a crown for bravery . 
  - homosexuality in females is almost absent from latin literature , but this is mainly because roman historians were all males and ... simply did not have a lot of experience in the matter . 
  there is in pompeii this graffiti wrote by a woman : `` i wish i could hold to my neck and embrace the little arms , and bear kisses on the tender lips . 
  go on , doll , and trust your joys to the winds ; believe me , light is the nature of men . '' - some romans kept a few beautiful male slaves in their villas , who were sometimes castrated to keep their androgynous look . 
  these slaves were called `` deliciae '' or `` delicati '' ( toys or delights ) . 
  nero was known for its male slave toys . 
  - assuming any passive role during sex was perceived as a severe loss of masculinity . 
  this in particular regarded the use of ones body to give pleasure to another . 
  the worst offense was oral sex , as not only the action was extremely submissive and servile , but violated the sanctity of the mouth , in latin `` os impurum '' ( impure mouth ) was something extremely obscene . 
  because of this stigma , oral sex was often used to mock others . 
  a graffiti in pompeii says : `` vote isidore for aedile ; he 's the best at licking cunt ! '' - considering the importance given to masculinity it is not a surprise that effeminacy was one of the worst offences and a favourite accusation in roman political invective , often used by the `` optimates '' , the conservative party of rome , against the `` populares '' , the democratic party . 
  - cross dressing was considered sign of very low masculinity . 
  a famous example of this can be seen in the intrusion of clodius pulcher in the annual rites of the bona dea that were restricted to women only . 
  cicero wrote : `` take away his saffron dress , his tiara , his girly shoes and purple laces , his bra , his greek harp , take away his shameless behavior and his sex crime , and clodius is suddenly revealed as a democrat . '' - there are around 90 recorded sex positions coming from ancient rome . 
  the most common in erotic art is `` mulier equitans '' or [ woman riding ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:pompeii_-_casa_del_ristorante_3.jpg ) ( kinda nsfw ) . 
  `` pedicare '' instead is the act of anally penetrating someone , martial wrote that anal sex felt better with boys and he taunts her wife with the inferiority of her anus . 
  & nbsp ; 10 - ** profanities ** : similarly to today , many swear words were centred around the genitals or sex , the most common were cunt , in latin `` cunnus '' , and cock , in latin `` mentula '' or `` verpa '' ( respectively normal and circumsized ) . 
  however the most offensive word was by far `` landica '' or the clitoris . 
  this last one was considered so obscene that a senator was almost expelled from the senate because the way he pronounced some words sounded like it . 
  `` hanc culpam maiorem an il * lam dicam * ? '' possible etymology of `` mentula '' is as a diminutive for `` mentis '' , mind , so meaning `` little mind '' . 
  `` verpa '' , instead comes from an ancient indoeuropean verb that meant `` to thrust '' , traces of which we see in dutch with `` werpen '' and lithuanian with `` varpa '' . 
  `` cunnus '' comes from a proto-indoeuropean word for woman , traces of which can be seen in persian with `` kos '' and in greek with `` kusthos '' . 
  contrary instead to today , words regarding excrements were not considered offensive , mainly because the romans satisfied their biological needs in large open public toilets , so there was very little indecency left in the act . 
  `` merda '' however ( meaning shit in latin ) was used to describe unedible food . 
  the modern words penis , anus , vagina and clitoris were all used as less offensive ways to refer to those body parts . 
  originally they meant respectively tail , ring , scabbard and key . 
  think about this next time you put your tail in its sheat . 
  to summarize the worst offense a roman could yell at another citizen was to go suck a dick/lick a cunt .

  good day r/europe . 
  it is me again !, 
  here it is the third chapter of our collections of facts about the roman empire . 
  i hope you like this one as well !, 
  as usual if not stated otherwise consider the following true for the imperial period . 
  1 - ** sino-roman relationships ** : while there was little diplomatic communication between the two empires they were aware of each other existence . 
  in chinese documents there is evidence of several roman diplomatic envoys arrived in china from the second century forward . 
  trade flowing through the two powers was instead pretty vast and lucrative , so much so that the parthian empire actively discouraged communications between the two to maintain monopoly over the flow of goods . 
  this trade flow was later called the silk road . 
  the exchanged goods were mainly chinese silk and roman glassware . 
  roman coins and glass were found in china , vietnam and even japan . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:roman_hanempiresad1.png ) you can see the two empires and their middle man . 
  the roman name for the chinese was serica for china proper and sinae for south asia . 
  the distinction was mainly between the land routes ( serica ) and sea ( sinae ) . 
  serica means land of the silk , while sinae comes from the greek term for south asia ( sinai ) , which has probably indo-aryan origins . 
  the chinese name for the roman empire instead was daqin , meaning great qin , from the first chinese dynasty , the qin dinasty . 
  the chinese regarded the roman empire as their equal if not an idealized version of their own empire . 
  this is probably due to the fact that the chinese never managed to send an envoy to the roman empire , while the romans did , so they had to rely on secundary sources . 
  here is what a general sent to investigate wrote :  its territory extends for several thousands of li ( half a kilometre ) . 
  they have established postal relays at intervals , which are all plastered and whitewashed . 
  there are pines and cypresses , as well as trees and plants of all kinds . 
  it has more than four hundred walled towns . 
  there are several tens of smaller dependent kingdoms . 
  the walls of the towns are made of stone another report , from another source :  their kings are not permanent rulers , but they appoint men of merit . 
  when a severe calamity visits the country , or untimely rain-storms , the king is deposed and replaced by another . 
  the one relieved from his duties submits to his degradation without a murmur . 
  the inhabitants of that country are tall and well-proportioned , somewhat like the han [ chinese ] , whence they are called [ daqin ] 2 - ** roman inventions ** : we often talk about the great military successes of rome ( well there was that time in a forest ... ) , but rarely talk of the technical innovations made during the roman empire . 
  here are some less known . 
  - water distribution : the citizens of rome were able to purchase the access to flowing water in their home for a set of hours in the day and the quantity of water used was carefully measured and billed , pretty much like today . 
  rome had at its disposal 1,000 cubic metres per day coming from 14 different aqueducts . 
  it would be enough to satisfy a modern city of a million inhabitants . 
  - steam engines : did not expect this one di you ? 
  known today as hero 's aeolipile , it was a machine that utilized steam to produce torque on the central mechanism . 
  [ here ] ( http://modelengines.info/aeolipile/dscf4290.jpg ) you can see a modern reconstruction . 
  unfortunately this engine is a pretty inefficient reaction engine . 
  there is no evidence that it was ever used if not as a technical wonder . 
  just think if the roman technicians managed to get a bit further and started the industrial revolution 1500 years ahead of schedule ( also a steampunk roman empire would be pretty epic ) . 
  unfortunately , even if they had the technical skills to build industrial machinery , the roman economy was centred around the eastern mediterranean , which lacks natural coal deposits and timber is relatively scarce , so an industrial revolution would have at the very least struggled to get going . 
  - hydraulic mining : in latin called `` ruina montium '' , which means literally `` wrecking of mountains '' ( because romans too could be pretty fucking metal ) . 
  the method was to excavate narrow cavities and then utilize high pressure water to fragment thick rock walls . 
  this technique was extensively used in all the empire and its effects can be still seen today in some locations , one of the most famous is [ las medusas ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/panor%c3%a1mica_de_las_m%c3%a9dulas.jpg ) in galicia , which was the biggest gold mine of the empire . 
  - glassblowing : while glass making was discovered at different times in different parts of the globe , glass blowing was invented around the 1 ^ st century b.c. 
  in roman controlled phoenicia ( modern israel and lebanon ) and quickly spread in all the empire . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/x88oi ) you can find an example , found in the south of spain . 
  as we said before glassworks were a lucrative export for the empire .
