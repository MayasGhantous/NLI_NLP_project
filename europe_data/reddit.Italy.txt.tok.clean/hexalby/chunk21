  - water turbine : while the theoretical groundwork for the machine was probably done during the hellenic occupation of the eastern mediterranean ( 4 ^ th century bc ) , it is under the roman empire that it was actually designed , built and widely utilized . 
  the water turbine is considered the first machine meant to harness natural forces to substitute human muscular labour ( well , some say it 's actually the sail , but let 's not loose ourselves in details now ) . 
  it was used in mills to saw wood and produce flour . 
  hopefully in different buildings . 
  [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/roman_mill_at_chemtou.jpg ) 's an example of the remains of one of these machines . 
  the large scale adoption of this machine occurred around the 1 ^ st century ad and not , how it is often thought , in the early days of the middle ages . 
  - dams : dams are a very ancient concept , the earliest examples of such structures can be found in mesopotamia and dated 3000 bc . 
  that said the romans brought immense innovation in dam construction techniques , specifically they pioneered arch dams , arch gravity dams , buttress dams , multiple arch buttress dams and bridge dams . 
  some of these structures are still used today . 
  you 're welcome , netherlands . 
  3 - ** the corinth canal ** : while the idea to build a canal was older than the roman empire the first attempt was done by [ nero ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:remains_of_nero%27s_isthmus_canal_in_1881.jpg ) . 
  unfortunately the project was cancelled after his death ( he was n't a particularly liked individual ) and no remains of the attempt survived , since the modern canal ( which was finished in 1893 ) follows the path of nero 's project . 
  4 - ** military engineering ** : while on the topic of engineering , the first ever engineering corps was created under the roman republic . 
  alexander too made use of engineers in his conquests , but they were never organized in a separate unit and made a permanent component of his armies . 
  under the roman army these men were responsible for much of the engineering feats the roman army is famous for , such as bridge construction or the set up of fortified military camps in merely days of work . 
  the most famous example is probably [ the circumvallation of alesia ] ( http://kara.allthingsd.com/files/2009/12/alesia_watercolor.jpg ) with a double layer of walls ( estimated to be 20 km long ) in just a few weeks . 
  other famous engineering feats are [ the ramp ] ( http://m8.i.pbase.com/o2/93/329493/1/124318838.gn1qthwd.jerusalemmay102173.jpg ) to reach the city of masada during its siege and the [ hadrian 's wall ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jqndo9c.jpg ) . 
  it is not exactly clear what rank they held in the roman army ranks . 
  we have mentions of a praefectus fabrum , which would have been the officer in charge of such unit , but it may have been simply an advisor to the general . 
  5 - ** famous quotes ** : we all know some famous quotes , like `` carpe diem '' , `` alea iacta est '' , `` romanes eunt domus '' , but there are a lot of very good ones that never get some love , so here 's a few of my favorite latin quotes that you can use to make fun of your ~ ~ ignorant ~ ~ intellectually challenged friends . 
  money has no smell . 
  said by vespasian , when his son protested his decision of imposing a tax on the distribution of urine , gathered in the public baths . 
  why the hell did romans sell urine ? 
  well because of its ammonia content , so it was used to tan leather and bleach clothes . 
  his son found the origin of the money rather disgusting , the emperor was n't instead particularly bothered . 
  - * in vino veritas * . 
  there 's truth in the wine . 
  meaning an inebriated person can only tell the truth , as his inhibitions are lowered by alchol . 
  the phrase is actually of greek origin ( \u1f18\u03bd \u03bf\u1f34\u03bd\u1ff3 \u1f00\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 ) , first found in a poem by alcaeus . 
  a lot of cultures have their version , but for reasons i can not really comprehend i personally prefer the latin one . 
  there are many laws in a corrupted state ( paraphrased a bit ) . 
  used by tacitus , meaning the more a state is corrupt , the more laws there are , as instead of serving the common good , ad personam laws are approved to serve personal interest . 
  i take this opportunity to show how the word republic came to be . 
  the word `` res '' in latin means a generic `` thing '' , while `` publica '' means , well , `` public '' , so the `` res publica '' means literally the public thing , or the common property of all . 
  the world wants to be deceived . 
  there is some controversy on the origin of the phrase , but it was probably said by scaevola during the period he was the pontifex maximus ( the highest position in the roman religion ) . 
  he then added `` ergo decipiatur '' or `` so i deceive it '' . 
  he was clearly a true believer . 
  one hand washes [ the other ] hand . 
  in english we have `` you scratch my back and i 'll scratch yours '' . 
  a favor for a favor . 
  the phrase comes from the satyricon of petronius , where it described a conspiracy of silence . 
  it was originally used for laughs ( i wo n't say anything if you do n't ! ), 
  but later assumed a meaning more towards corruption and illegal behaviour . 
  whatever is said in latin , appears profound . 
  this is the quote you 'll use if you are the intellectually challenged friend to get revenge on the nerd on duty . 
  6 - ** no taxation without representation ** : what the hell is doing here this 18 ^ th century american motto ? 
  well let me explain . 
  during the first triumvirate of octavianus ( later augustus ) , lepidus and marcus antonius , there was lack of funds to sustain the war effort against the legions loyal to caesar 's assassins . 
  the proposed solution was to impose a tax over the wealthiest 1400 women of rome . 
  this obviously angered the ladies so they reunited in front of the senate to protest against the law . 
  hortensia was elected spokeswoman and with her moving speech managed to partially repeal the law ( the number of women was reduced to 400 ) . 
  she technically had no right to speak in the senate , but roman law was written to be quite elastic during war times , so none protested . 
  except for octavian , antony , and lepidus . 
  beaten by a woman . 
  the horror . 
  this is what reached us of the speech hortensia gave , wrote by the historian appian in his chronicles of the civil wars :  `` you have already deprived us of our fathers , our sons , our husbands , and our brothers , whom you accused of having wronged you ; if you take away our property also , you reduce us to a condition unbecoming our birth , our manners , our sex . 
  why should we pay taxes when we have no part in the honours , the commands , the state-craft , for which you contend against each other with such harmful results ? 
  ` because this is a time of war , ' do you say ? 
  when have there not been wars , and when have taxes ever been imposed on women , who are exempted by their sex among all mankind ? '', 
  7 - ** colonies ** : originally the term `` colonia '' ( from which the modern word colony ) meant simply an outpost to keep an area under control , but with time the term came to denote the highest status of a city . 
  since the roman empire did not have a standing army as we know it today , local territory control was tasked to bodies of roman colonists living in these outposts . 
  these colonists had also the job of romanizing the area , teaching latin , roman culture and laws to the populace . 
  during the empire these men were usually the veterans of the army and their families . 
  here are some examples of colonies that survived to today and kept their latin name . 
  the name comes from a gaulish term meaning white ( vindo - ) , probably because of the river danube flowing through it , and fortification ( - bona ) . 
  so the meaning is `` white castle . '' - lutetia parisiorum \u2192 paris . 
  the etymology for lutetia is a bit uncertain , but it probably had to do with swamp , while parisiorum was from the name of the tribe that lived there . 
  so the meaning is `` the swamp of the parisii . '' - londinium \u2192 london . 
  the latin names is a romanization of the original name given by the native tribes . 
  there is no consensus on the origin , the most accepted one is from the indo-european word plowonida meaning `` fast flowing river '' , referring to the thames . 
  again the latin name is an adaptation of the native celtic name which had to do with water , probably referring to lake zurich ( which is a lake in illinois apparently ) . 
  - colonia agrippina \u2192 cologne . 
  the modern name comes directly from the latin colonia . 
  similarly to paris this one as well owes its name to the native barbarian tribe . 
  so it means `` city ( of augustus ) of the treviri '' . 
  the name comes from the celtic language and meant `` breast shaped hill '' - mogontiacom \u2192 mainz . 
  the name comes from the gallic god mogons , which the roman soldiers stationed in the colonia adopted . 
  the god name meant the great one . 
  the river main owes his name to the roman colony as well . 
  the city owes its name to the legion `` legio vi victrix '' which was the legion that completed the conquest of hispania under the command of augustus . 
  valentia comes from vales , meaning strenght , while edentanorum refers to the local tribe . 
  so the meaning is `` fort of the edetani '' sources : - * ancient engineers ' inventions : precursors of the present * . 
  springer . 
  - * greek and roman technology : a sourcebook . 
  * john w. humphrey , john p. oleson , andrew n. sherwood . 
  - * encyclopedia of the roman empire . 
  * m. bunson . 
  - * commanding and consuming the world : empire , tribute , and trade in roman and chinese history . 
  * peter f. bang . 
  - * the civil wars .

  so we all like the joke of italy fancying different sides of the same war , but the memes never really tell what actually happened . 
  so here i am to the rescue !, 
  ** the backstory ** : let 's start with why italy declared neutrality at the start of the war in 1914 . 
  the triple alliance was initially a defensive alliance , formed in 1879 , between the austrian empire and the german empire against the growing power of russia , which while on an industrial level was far behind germany or france or england , it was still a tremendous threat . 
  italy joined the alliance in 1882 , in response of france gaining control of tunis and the british-french alliance , which made britain responsible for the mutual defense of the english channel , so freed the french fleet to concentrate in the mediterranean , possibly against italy . 
  loosing this opportunity to expand in africa , italy was left isolated and without possibility to expand if not in the balkans . 
  so why ally with austria , which was the other power interested in a hegemony over that region ? 
  the answer is that italy knew very well it had no chance of winning a war against austria , so decided to go the diplomatic route , backed by germany , which was interested in having italy in the alliance .
