  in 1902 during the renewal of the triple alliance , italy and austria agreed on not interfering with the balance of power in the balkans without first negotiating with the other for an eventual compensation . 
  when the war was declared italy had not been previously informed by austria , which was the aggressor , so italy not only was not obliged to join because of the defensive nature of the alliance , but the equilibrium of the balkans was disrupted without italy 's consent , going against the stipulated treaty . 
  another reason for the initial neutrality of italy was the rivalry between the two countries . 
  austria had been the enemy of italy since its creation , having fought against in three separate wars to liberate north italy . 
  some regions considered italians were still under the control of austria . 
  the italian public opinion of austria was pretty hostile and was reciprocated by the empire . 
  the alliance was in place because of the decisions of the italian elite and not reciprocated by the population . 
  so [ italy observed and pondered ] ( http://www.minerva.unito.it/theatrum%20chemicum/pace&guerra/immaginiitalia/equilibrio.jpg ) , while the great powers of europe attacked each other . 
  ** the crossroad ** : joining the central powers was considered , but failed to gather enough political support to become a possibility . 
  still some politicians tried to push italy towards war against the entente : the ministry of foreign affairs , sonnino , said `` le cambiali bisogna pagarle '' ( you have to pay your bills ) , while cadorna , the italian chief of staff , was already planning the dispatch of 5 italian division to support the german offensive in the rhine . 
  as the king of italy put it though `` there would be no desire or interest to award adequate compensations for the sacrifices [ the war ] would require '' . 
  that is there would have been little to gain for italy to join the war with germany and austria compared to the colossal expenditure the war would have required . 
  another important reason was the lack of natural resources available in the peninsula . 
  the italian economy for example depended for 90 % of its coal demand on britain , entering the war would have required assurance that germany or austria could have provided the needed supplies and since they themselves were starved for resources it was an unlikely possibility . 
  so considering their option , italy was divided between neutrality or intervention with the allies . 
  while in a modern perspective this option would seem easily the best , there were some serious concerns that would have to be addressed if italy was to remain neutral . 
  the biggest risk was , simply , a victory of germany on the french front , and this possibility almost materialized when the german army was stopped only kilometers away from paris in the battle of the marne . 
  a central powers victory would have meant for a neutral italy at best the loss of any possibility of establishing influence in the balkans , not to mention a protracted austrian dominion over trent and trieste , at worst italy would have had to suffer an austrian `` vengeance '' , as cadorna put it . 
  the political parties that supported joining the war with the allies were : - much of the conservative party , which was the party in control of the parliament . 
  their hope was that the war would reinforce the institutions , making italy a more authoritarian state . 
  - the monarchy , which hoped to increase the prestige of italy and consequently its legitimacy in a world were the crown was less and less influential . 
  - the nationalists , with anti-liberal , anti-socialist , imperialist views . 
  they saw the war as the last chapter of the italian independence wars against the old enemy , austria . 
  - the anarcho-syndacalist elements of the socialist party supported the intervention , hoping the war would bring social revolution ( which kind of did , but not in the direction they hoped ) . 
  - numerous elements of the industrial bourgeoisie , who , tired of the previous centrist government , desirous to gain the center stage in the country , inflamed by the new artistic views of the futurism movement and d\u2019annunzio 's work , wanted to join the great war . 
  - the allies ( duh ) , which hoped to keep some of the central powers forces occupied in italy . 
  supporters of neutrality were instead : - the catholics , mainly because of the condemnation of the war by the pope , which was not only moved by the christian value of pacifism , but also did not want to attack austria , who was the last catholic great power . 
  - the vast majority of the socialists , which saw the war as a useless massacre , against the international scope of the socialist movement ( in contrast with the french and german socialist movements , who were more in favor of the war ) . 
  - the liberal party , which was the most represented party after the conservatives . 
  their motivation though was not ideological aversion to war , but purely based on the potential gains italy could have with neutrality . 
  when the situation changed , so did their position . 
  - germany , which did not want to open another front and was hoping to use italy to supply itself of all the goods of which domestic production was insufficient , mainly food and some raw materials . 
  the debate fiercely divided italy . 
  towards may of 1914 manifestations , often violent , of the interventionists or the neutralists were common place . 
  fighting between the two groups almost guaranteed . 
  the political turmoil of this period laid the basis for the ascension to power of benito mussolini . 
  the man was initially in the socialist party , but was kicked out when he declared himself in favor of the war . 
  he organized numerous manifestations in favor of italian intervention as well as several violent repressions of neutralist protests towards the end of the year . 
  ** the negotiations ** : while the infighting raged on the government tried to initiate negotiations with the central powers . 
  after the attack on serbia an attempt to approach austria diplomatically was made and initially the empire was open for dialogue , but made it clear that would have kept the negotiations going only if italy actually joined the war . 
  neutrality was not enough . 
  in truth austria was quite aware of the fact that italy would have been more useful as a neutral country , rather than an ally , not to mention berlin was pressuring the austrian government to keep italy out of the war . 
  the reason it insisted on italy 's intervention was because the empire was sure of a fast victory , but allied victory later in 1914 made it clear that the war would had been quite longer . 
  the first entente power to approach italy was russia , which promised italy tyrol , trieste and vlor\u00eb ( albania ) , but the italian government , aiming for the control of the adriatic , wanted also the austrian controlled dalmatia . 
  the proposal was refused . 
  the reason vlor\u00eb was offered was because the city was under italian control . 
  on october 23 in fact because italy sent some forces to re-establish order as the population rebelled against the fragile government of the prince , vilhelm vidi , who in the mean time took refuge in italy . 
  the entrance of the ottoman empire with the central powers in the war changed things , as austria could no longer promise italy territorial gains in the eastern mediterranean . 
  under german pressure austria offered to make the occupation of albania permanent , but refused to talk about trent and trieste , even after germany offered a piece of silesia as compensation for the loss . 
  meanwhile von b\u00fclow , the german ambassador in italy , managed to convince the government to settle for trent and give up trieste . 
  after another austrian refusal of discussing the matter however italy began negotiating with the allies once again . 
  after some back and forth an agreement was reached : in exchange for the intevention in the war italy was promised trent , south tyrol , julian venetia , istria , dalmatia , the coal basin of antalya ( turkey ) , vlor\u00eb , sazan island ( albania ) , the islands of kvarner bay ( croatia ) and protectorate over albania .

  in may 4 italy proclaimed the alliance with vienna void . 
  may 23 , the parliament approved the declaration of war and as the saying goes , the rest is history . 
  i hope it was an interesting read , i am curious to know what side would you have been on . 
  war with the central powers ? 
  neutrality ? 
  war with the allies ? 
  do you think italy joining the war with germany and austria would have changed the outcome of the war ? 
  what about neutrality ?

  why are you down here . 
  go up !, 
  that is not depression or apathy , it 's alienation , a state of being that is extremely useful to our kind overlords . 
  same thing here . 
  in all political matter there 's still the shadow of the old `` christian democracy '' party . 
  not to mention the hundred of millions of taxpayer money going to the church , still based on the pacts written during the fascist regime . 
  it worked in england . 
  fascist regimes were surging everywhere in europe . 
  of all european cities i visited i must say paris is incredible , praha as second place and amsterdam as third . 
  well i thought you were joking , but i 'm starting to think you 're both serious ... 
  ... i wan na get off mr italy wild ride . 
  well it was part of the holy roman empire . 
  [ i promessi sposi intensifies ] that book ( the betrothed ) is a literary singularity of boredom . 
  you should , it 's a great series . 
  surprisingly touching and subtle . 
  well subtle for american standards ... , 
  i trust my politicians as much as i trust a cat not to push things off a table . 
  do n't worry , pretty soon we 'll be hit by another * unpredictable * economic crisis , right extremists will take power and europe will enter a second dark age . 
  but for a magical moment in history , we created a lot of value for our shareholder . 
  all our colonies were `` given '' to us in the sense the colonial powers promised they would not occupy them . 
  it is n't now , but it was . 
  socialism is an umbrella term for many political currents that are inspired or are direct descendants of communist or anarchist theory . 
  so are you of germanic descent , coming from the franks or the burgundians or celtic descent from gauls or italic/greek descent from roman or greek colonists ? 
  part of my family comes from the descendants of the cimbri , an ancient celtic tribe that settled [ in the north-east of italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cimbri#descendants ) . 
  i also have a branch of the family coming from hungary , but i do n't know much about this aside from what my relatives told me . 
  i imagine it is no too different from what happened to our own far left parties . 
  decades of anti left propaganda , foreign and internal meddling , corruption and the result is a socialist party in name only . 
  considering we obtained our colonies by making puppy eyes to france and england and we were terrible at managing them ( or even conquering them in the first place ) ... honestly i do n't have really an opinion . 
  well it 's like ... polish that got over its consonant addiction . 
  jokes aside i 'm often surprised by how similarly we pronounce vowels . 
  what 's a career ? 
   the law of jante would apply very much to the mindset of trump if you changed all that makes the law of jante the law of jante . 
  ah yes , ayn rand , who advocated for anarcho capitalism brought to the extreme while she never had a single day of honest work in her life . 
  most do n't even remember the name of our royal family and within those that do many would not mind reinstating the recently lifted banishment they had on the family . 
  uh you know venetian ? 
  it was suggested to 12 year old me by runescape when i created my first character . 
  father 32 , mother 27,
