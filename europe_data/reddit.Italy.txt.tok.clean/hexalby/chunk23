  that 's another theory for the origin of the term , but many do not find it valid , because of the difference in sound between getto and ghetto ( soft and hard ) . 
  it 's more likely the term came from somewhere else . 
  anyway it 's quite possible you 're right , but personally i think the hypotesis i wrote has a bit more weight behind it . 
  oh there 's another fun one , though not exactly in topic . 
  the word ** ghetto ** is from the name of the ancient jewish district of venice . 
  it is not certain but the word probably comes from the diminutive of ** borgo ** ( borghetto ) , which comes from the old german ** burg ** , meaning hill fort , ( from which also the english word ** borough ** comes from ) . 
  in one of the strangest twists of history the italian word for war is ** guerra ** which comes from old german ** werra ** ( from which the english `` war '' ) . 
  ** werra ** originally meant something on the line of `` messy clash '' and was used to distinguish the disorganized skirmishes of medieval europe from the ** bellum ** ( latin for war ) , the organized battles of antiquity . 
  surprisingly ( not really ) medieval italians were feeling self deprecatory . 
  or they did not like germans very much . 
  the twist ? 
  the italian word for beautiful is ** bello ** , which sounds pretty close to ** bellum ** , but it 's atually from ** bellus ** , diminutive of ** bonus ** which in latin meant `` good '' . 
  this . 
  it 's not like we do n't have new companies , but as soon as they threaten to gain even an insignificant percentage of the market it 's mmediately bought or brought to its knees . 
  edit : i meant knees , not feet . 
  i need a coffee . 
  well it 's not exactly an happy song , but it has a good rithm , i guess !, 
  it 's not exactly what you wanted op , but i was really surprised to discover `` bella ciao '' was an internationally famous song . 
  i can still remember my great grand father singing it to me as a kid . 
  he was a communist partisan in ww2 figthing against the italian social republic . 
  i think he had no small role in my far left political leanings . 
  excuse my french here as well . 
  well for me the argument is a bit broader . 
  banks are private insitutions , even many of the national banks are privatized . 
  the fact that public money is used to save private institutions is more than insulting to many people . 
  you can make the argument that banks are neessary for the economy to run , but if that 's the case you need to have a correspondent public entity so that the government is able to effectively control and manage crises . 
  you 'll find it 's pretty hard to justify giving bailouts to private non bank entities , then why do these institutions hold such a priviledged position ? 
  and more importantly are they deserving of this ? 
  especially considering what we had to do to get out of the crisis , how many years of austerity ? 
  how many more ? 
  how come these privately owned , profit driven society get a free pas and the rest of the economy can go fuck themselves ? 
  i agree with you the ecb does not reall discriminate like it is often said , but there is no dobut a bias towards banking firms and the various governments of the eu ( including the central one ) . 
  for paris is just enough to have a good look . 
  we did the same and after a week there still was a lot that we could see . 
  have n't been to london as a tourist yet . 
  i do n't know why but here in italy we have so frigging many weeaboos . 
  no really , literally half the cartoons i saw as a kid were anime and i think the same is true now . 
  aside from that we have a lot of crime series from germany and france . 
  not an argument . 
  it 's not like we wanted to conquer you or anything !, 
  b-baka !,

  bonus points for the title of the gif, 
  `` get off my damn lawn ! '', 
  they 're just following [ the manual ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) do n't worry . 
  oh i 'm pretty sure there are exceptions if there is historical value . 
  for example there are still plenty of schools with fasces on their walls ( here a lot of schools tend to be in very old buildings , especially those towards the centre of cities ), 
  ** comet sighted ** ^ the ^ economy , ^ fools !, 
  [ eu4 intensifies ], 
  oh yes i forgot . 
  still it 's something tha twould be pretty difficult to apply in reality . 
  til europeans are into bdsm a lot more than i though . 
   marry : germany so this is how stockholm syndrome feels like ? 
  the emperor and his holy inquisition approve of this message !, 
  but that makes it even better !, 
  it 's illegal to use fascist symbolism , so yeah it 's technically illegal but there 's nothing preventing anyone to rebrand it and pretend it 's something else . 
  really fucking high . 
  and the problem is that none is really buying , since we have some of the lowest wages in europe . 
  yet there is wild speculation that brings corrupt officials and toxic companies to build horrendous monstrosities on every available centimetre . 
  but ehi !, 
  do n't worry !, 
  if by an absolutely tiny chance the market implodes we will pay to bail out the criminals responsible . 
  are n't you already feeling better ? 
  it is partly influenced , but the star is a really ancient symbol for [ italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stella_d%e2%80%99italia ) . 
  the cogwheel is instead a reference to the first line of our constitution : `` italy is a democratic republic , built on labour '' which was written in as a compromise between the socialist parties and the liberal parties . 
  italy always had one of the biggest far left parties in all of europe outside the soviet block , in particular just after world war 2 where by far the communists were the biggest partisan group . 
  well we owe the name of our country to you guys , even if its meaning is not particularly inspiring , 
  can i use roman rulers ? 
  'cause [ caligula ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/caligola#/media/file:gaius_caesar_caligula.jpg ) was pretty fine and [ vibia sabina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vibia_sabina#/media/file:vibia_sabina.jpg ) as well . 
   private property enhances personal liberty but creating personal domains and giving you authority over your possessions with this you are essentially defining personal property as the amount of personal influence an individual holds over his peers . 
  since private property is an exclusionary statement , the fact that enhances personal freedom implies that such freedom is gained at the expenses of other men . 
   that is up to each and everyone of us . 
  oh good way to avoid the question !, 
  you esentially said : `` well you just have to do it right ! '', 
   international struggles have more to do with power politics rather than vague ideas . 
  i really do n't understand your sentence , but if i interpret it right you are saying that resources control is not an important factor in international politics . 
  am i right ? 
  because if so i really do n't have to work hard to debunk it . 
  did i argue that ? 
  all that i said is , to quote a roman proverb `` si vis pacem , para bellum '' . 
  my revolution can be as peaceful as i want , but if i want to succeed i need to be prepared to fight . 
  of course any type of revolutionary force will be billed as terrorism or fascism or `` dirty commie '' and that will be used to attack me directly and indirectly , no matter what are the ideas behind me . 
  did you actually read any socialist theory at all ? 
  or anarchist ? 
  or are you just repeating what you were told about it ? 
  italy : [ the red biennium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biennio_rosso ) was a period of extreme civil unrest and a leading cause of the birth of the fascist state in italy . 
  later during the [ italian civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_civil_war ) the communists and socialists were by far the biggest group in the italian resistance . 
  after ww2 the italian communist party was one of the biggest after communist countries and during the [ years of lead ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/years_of_lead_ ( italy ) ) italy was subject to numerous terror attacks , many of which done under the direction of the cia , with [ operation gladio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_gladio ) to prevent the formation of a communist uprising in italy . 
  germany : during [ the german revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_revolution_of_1918%e2%80%9319 ) right after ww1 , there was the [ spartacist uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spartacist_uprising ) lead by rosa luxemburg , which was killled by the german social democrats and the attempted [ socialist bavarian republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bavarian_soviet_republic ) . 
  france : [ the paris commune ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_commune ) was a short lived but an extrememly important uprising , that would have profound influence on karl marx and anarchist theorists . 
  spain : [ revolutionary catalonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_catalonia ) was an importat component of the spanish civil war , attacked by both the fascists and the republicas and denied help from the soviet union because of its anarchist soul . 
  despite that it managed to thrive during the war . 
   communists revolts are useless , like any revolt how do you think all the benefits you enjoy were gained ? 
  by gently asking our masters if they can spare a penny ? 
  by saying this you are ignoring the blood spiiled by thousands that fought for us to have what we have . 
  do you think the 8 hours workday was obtained peacefully ? 
  or security measures on the work place ? 
  do you think public health care was simply a coincidence ? 
  there was money laying around so might as well cure the poor with it , i guess . 
  do you think it was just a coincidence that fascist regimes popped up in countries whose ecomonies were destroyed or close to collapse ?
