  it is a center-left leaning party . 
  the `` 5 star movement '' is the second biggest party and is a populist party with ever shifting ideology and goals . 
  on the right we have `` forza italia '' which is the party led by berlusconi and `` the northern league '' another populist party that aims to make north italy indipendent ( but never actually tried to proceed with it even when they were in the government ) . 
   national day well we have the republic day , 2 june , which remembers the post ww2 referendum on republic vs monarchy . 
  then we have the liberation day , 25 april , which remembers the liberation of italy from fascist forces during ww2 . 
   things that would make a person understand your country better italy was never culturally united and likely never will . 
  there are some extremem differences between the north , the centre and the south . 
  every region has its language , often almost incomprehensible for non local italians , its traditions , its cuisine , its history . 
  also trains are never on time . 
  moroso intended as in [ mora ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/mora_ ( diritto % 29 ) fattura as magical curse , imposing the evil eye ( [ malocchio ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/fattura_ ( magia % 29 ) ) on someone . 
  * moroso * , which means both fiance and someone insolvent . 
  * fattura * which means both invoice and magic spell . 
  if you want to know how english sounds [ listen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bsntrxtlre ) to this . 
  it was a song made by adriano celentano to make fun of all the english songs broadcasted in italy . 
  the song does not have lyrics , it 's just a bunch of english sounding gibberish with occasionally an actual word . 
  test, 
  r/socialism is a general subreddit for the far left . 
  then there is r/communism and r/anarchy which are more specific . 
  r/fullcommunism is just for memes . 
  nothing serious there . 
  just like for capitalism though there are a lot of different philosophies considered `` socialists '' like authoritarian socialism ( the soviet union ) , social democracy , anarcho-communism , libertiarian socialism , etc. 
  you can not simply point at russia and say `` see !, 
  it does n't work ! '', 
  or i can point at greece and say `` see !, 
  capitalism is a joke ! '', 
  true , revolutions are bloody affairs , but rarely in our history old power structures were demolished through non violent means . 
  unfortunately it is quite impossible to modify society without ( often violent ) struggle . 
  and millions are dying to protect the current power structure ... 
  yeah i guess that was the attitude in the french royal court in 1789, 
  in all honesty i have to agree , which is a shame since i consider myself a socialist . 
  that said i also think that r/socialism is way better than r/altright is . 
  i like r/europe as well . 
  not a lot of subs have such a calm and open attitude ( despite the growing right wing rhetoric ), 
  r/capitalismvsocialism is what you want . 
  where did i say i prefer a circlejerk to political discussion ? 
  i am quite active here on r/europe and i posted a couple of times in total on r/socialism r/fullcommunism does not count , it 's just for the memes . 
  oh good . 
  hope you liked it !, 
  it was already broken when i came here !, 
  i 'll gladly discuss things if you want . 
  not here though . 
  i hope it was n't during the summer . 
  rome can be an oven . 
  [ my face is my shield !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtnfsufskvg ), 
  well europe does not have the best track record as far as acceptance is concerned . 
  we 're slowly getting better , but fascism is always a looming menace . 
  if you feel reddit is becoming too right wing i invite you to come and have fun with us at r/fullcommunism or r/socialism if you want to have serious conversations rather than memes , 
   because r/the _ donald is swarming our sub-reddit like tyrannids this is enough for me to upvote you . 
  emperor protect us . 
  the straw that broke the camel 's back . 
  i mean it 's a pretty awesome image . 
  mostly because they were proud of having guessed the accent and then finding out they were quite far away . 
  it happened a lot to my mother . 
  when she worked in germany they would mistaken her for english and when she was in england they would mistake her for a german . 
  she told me she loved seeing the disappointed looks people had when she revealed she was italian . 
  they were different times though . 
  we are talking of more than 20 years ago . 
  who the hell downvotes the bot ? 
  the problem is that ( sort of ) direct democracy is very difficult to apply to a country with a very large population . 
  the scandinavian countries can probably use a similar system without too many problems , but a country like great britain , france or germany it would be quite impossible . 
  not only for the logistical problems that comes with it , but also for the difficulties in actually informing the public on what they are voting on . 
  see brexit or our constitutional referendum , if you ask a random citizen of one of these countries what exactly they voted on they 'll give you a vague kinda sorta maybe right answer .

  ... you guys have way too much fun with this . 
  seriously those are 119 letters . 
  can you actually pronounce it ? 
  [ probably because of this ] ( https://www.buzzfeed.com/jobarrow/we-are-coming-o-rome?utm_term=.wc7npdkwo#.nfvzryjxo ), 
   eierschalensollbruchstellenverursachertestmaschinengenusnormierungsrichtlinienworttest google translate says it means :  eggshell breaking points polluter test equipment genus normalization directive word test so i guess it is a test about how much pollution breaking an egg produces ? 
  tested with different equipments ? 
  yeah i realized just now . 
  i haz the dumb apparently . 
  you and u/geejo posted pretty much the same thing together . 
  i do n't know what i expected from / pol /, 
  well i meant between the ones that sent troops in the middle east, 
  is the same thing for france and belgium too ? 
  he was acting suspicious before , that 's why the police stopped him , but they did not recognize him until they looked at his gun and passport . 
  it was more like the king and the elite were shitting in their pants that the communist movement would come and take their heads , but yes having guns probably helped mussolini . 
  eh could have been worse . 
  2016 was a weird year . 
  is that actually a word ? 
  considering it was our king that happily handed italy to mussolini , no thank you . 
  i mean people outside of italy were saying that if our referendum was lost we would go out as well ... 
   food friend [ mmmm ] ( http://img.memecdn.com/cannibalism-makes-a-comeback_o_190067.jpg ), 
  i may be seeing a pattern here . 
  we have 22 % vat , and in a couple of years it 'll go to 25 % . 
  beat that !, 
  i mean it could be bigger . 
  at leats the bbb does not have the prussian space marines . 
   want to learn one day : italian . 
  good luck !, 
   never consider imperial guard as even close to favourite u w0t m8 ? 
  no , but i studied latin for five years so that 's probably why . 
  actually usually i am bothered by their choice of using latin sound words rather than the actual latin words , i mean they do n't need to invent words !, 
  i agree then . 
  if that 's the case the entire po valley would go down as well . 
   have the imperium on the back foot for a while implying it is n't since the emperor took his vacation . 
   i collect aos chaos . 
  i see we have some heresy here to deal with . 
  in all honesty it would be time for gw to bring the plot forward with 40k but i hope they do n't end of time it .
