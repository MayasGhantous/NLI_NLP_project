  personally i would pick stalker over metro any day of the week , but that 's just personal taste, 
  soma is better than amnesia , imho . 
  i have n't played penumbra , i admit . 
  german engin ... 
  i mean czech engineering !, 
  did n't know it . 
  i rarely play racing games though i admit . 
  ck2 is awesome as well . 
  nothing like doing a grand campaign ck2 -  eu4 -  vic2 -  hoi4, 
  i agree . 
  there 's not a lot of games that can come close to the witcher 3 . 
  wait , are we competing ? 
   daedalic point 'n' click adventure which exactly ? 
  i do n't know them very well . 
  my favorite actually is victoria 2 , but eu4 comes a close second . 
  nothing an anschluss or two ca n't resolve . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  i was saying carthage because it was the second most probable superpower after rome . 
  still who wants to speak germanic languages ? 
  latin is better !, 
  ( / s 'cause you never know ), 
  i failed exams because of paradox games . 
  so many hours burned . 
  ... no regrets . 
  well at least you have choice xd, 
  ehi be careful there , it seems you have a rather vicious cough . 
  ehi we have 20 times your population and still we have n't managed to make famous games . 
  well 2048 is rather famous i think . 
  modern romans are proud . 
  ` nuff said . 
  oh it 's norwegian ? 
  i loved that series !, 
  really ? 
  i thought it stopped before . 
  good to know !, 
  constantinople became the administrative capital of the empire only in the forth century , but even after rome maintained a very important role . 
  regional identity is very strong in italy . 
  that 's one of our greatest problems actually , not a single region considers itself truly italian , but from lombardy , piedmont , tuscany , etc. 
  this has much to do with how italy was formed , it was n't a popular movement with the idea of a national identity behind , it was a war of conquest by the savoia ( our ex royal family ) , supported by the french that saw italy almost as a client state . 
  the roman empire legacy is still strong anyway , after all almost all fascist propaganda was based on the roman empire . 
  the name itself comes from the `` fascis '' , which were the weapons of the `` lictores '' , the guards of the roman magistrates , who beat down with bundles of wooden sticks ( fascis ) any rebellious citizen in the way . 
  & nbsp ; so fascist literally means `` holder of the stick '' ( paraphrasing it a bit ) . 
  ahah well we all have that guilty pleasure from our childhood . 
  do n't know how many playthroughs i 've done of that game . 
  still do n't know how the hero is called . 
  eh , we 're worse , no title in recent memory even came close to being popular . 
  and my brother stays entire afternoons on warband . 
  it 's a great game !, 
  cd project red are the only developers , together with paradox , that i still have faith in . 
  gwent is love , gwent is life . 
  eheh the mafia games are pretty good , but my favorite game from czech republic is space engineers . 
  well ubisoft has a lot of great games . 
  beyond good and evil is beautiful . 
  dind ' t know dishonored was developed in france . 
  i admit i have n't played too many anno titles , but they 're some of the best management games . 
  i love the gothic series from germany . 
  it 's unfortunate that piranha bytes are not having too much success now . 
  not everyone was conquered , for example the tribe that inhabited the modern venetian region ( where i live ) were first close allies and then peacefully annexed . 
  anyway i absolutely agree !, 
  if there is one thing the romans are known for is that they were very practical people , none cared where you where born , as long as you held the empire 's interest above all . 
  funny though that it is a dutch saying this , considering that the netherlands were never under roman occupation . 
  oh i did n't know it was finnish . 
  good game !, 
  `` if it was n't for us ya 'll be speaking carthaginian now ! '', 
  not into the netherlands though . 
  too savage there up north . 
  buddy they 're right . 
  you do know that several emperors were spanish right ? 
  the most famous is trajan , the emperor that saw the maximum territorial expansion of rome . 
  also spain was under the control of carthage before being taken by rome during the second punic war . 
  damn , that 's beautiful . 
  can we switch mountains for a while ? 
  do agree . 
  i mean some cities are beautiful , but nothing like a small town surrounded by mountains . 
  mmm , you can still see some venetian influence in the buildings , beautiful towns . 
  i do n't get why the downvotes honestly ... 
  i have to admit this is very german . 
  well , you know those slot machines that spin pulling a lever . 
  that 's how the m5s chooses its positions . 
  well there 's a certain region in italy that actually does n't exists . 
  ah ah ah ahahahahahahaahahah ahhhhhhhi 'm sorry i forgot what we were talking about .

  so some time ago there was a thread about us italians and how we viewed our grandpa . 
  now i 'm actually curious to know what you other europeans think of the roman empire . 
  is it seen as a cruel conqueror ? 
  a slaver ? 
  is it considered part of your culture or just a footnote in history ? 
  non-europeans are welcomed too , especially those that too have in their history great empires . 
  also what is your favorite army and why is it the imperial guard ? 
  so in the last year we 've seen a drastic increase of terrorist attacks throughout europe , but italy is not yet being protagonist of one , which is strange since we too sent troops in the middle east and the seat of the catholic church is here . 
  i read that one possible reason is because our police had to deal for as long as italy existed with very strong organized crime syndicates and a lot of domestic terrorism from both the far left and the far right , sowe have `` more experience '' in dealing with terrorism . 
  another reason is that maybe it is the mafia itself to deter jihadists organizations . 
  i find this idea both hilarious and terrifying honestly . 
  mainly terrifying . 
  furthermore it may be because it 's harder to become an italian citizen compared to the rest of europe . 
  for example there are 110 italian foreign fighters fighting for isis , compared to the 800 germans .
