  i 'll see myself out . 
  the plebs are coming !, 
  a specter is haunting europe ... 
  oh probably yes . 
  legions were not permanently stationend somewhere . 
  even in russia the `` fasces '' are present . 
  interesting . 
  well muscovy considered itself the third rome after all . 
  uh i like your approach . 
   also the chi-rho was n't a western empire symbol you 're right on that , but it 's also the symbol most associated with the western roman empire now . 
  [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/ixdycmc ) maybe be a better alternative . 
  if you have better ideas feel free to post . 
  did not know that !, 
  interesting . 
  the fasces were the weapons of the lictores , which were the bodyguards of the roman magistrates . 
  the symbolism of the fasces suggested strength through unity , so that 's probably why they were used by various political entities in history . 
  well provinces did not have flags of their own ( not official one at least ) but we could use the flags of the legions stationed there , in hispania we have : [ legio vi victrix ] ( http://imgur.com/gtmu88y ) [ legio ii augusta ] ( http://imgur.com/1vwcvce ), 
  oh i see thanks !, 
  is ... is that actually a thing ? 
  what 's a rubberbandit ? 
  the only problem with that flag is the similarity with the fascist flag . 
  the thing the eagle is standing on are the `` fasces '' which in latin means bundle of sticks and from where the word fascism comes from . 
  the byzantine empire changed flags in its history ) [ holy roman empire ] ( http://imgur.com/6wtxfix ) i am all fine for this , 
  ehhh you make a good point , but i think missiles are not necessary the future . 
  electromagnetic guns i think will be a better alternative once technology gets better . 
  that said , i am obviously talking `` out of my ass '' , pardon my french , since i have no military knowledge . 
  also great username . 
  are you a transhumanist ? 
  oh i 'm not saying that they are onver and will never be used again . 
  i am just saying that the time where missiles were the ultimate weapon is over . 
  just like with cavalry and tanks . 
  more or less when we switched sides . 
  i feel though that the era of missiles is going to end pretty soon with ever more sofisticated pint defense laser systems . 
  awww no fiat, 
  [ see first point ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ituif/some_interesting_facts_about_ancient_rome/ ) ( shameless self promotion ), 
  we should learn from the us recovery from the great depression . 
  heavily tax the wealthy and funnel money in the lower classes . 
  that 's how you breath life in an economy . 
  pretty good estimates anyway i have to say . 
  you might post this in r/theydidthemath, 
  oh ok i see what you mean . 
  i was more thinking of the area of the brain that we do not necessarily need simulated , like sense of smell or hearing . 
  that would cut out quite a number of neurons involved in those processes . 
  well you do n't need to simulate every neuron . 
  i would suggest privacy badger . 
  it is made by the electronic frontier foundation , a non profit organization , and not a for profit company like ghostery . 
  well i was asking mainly to know if it was something interesting to post . 
  but do n't worry !, 
  i 'll do my best !, 
  now i am picturing romans with wild west clothes chasing the latest gold rush in hispania . 
  it 's not actually the average face , iirc they took a couple of hundreds images and overimposed them one over the other, 
  ehi everyone !, 
  i wanted to ask what would you like to see in the next one . 
  i still have more than enough to make another post about rome , focusing on medicine and slavery . 
  otherwise we can explore medieval europe . 
  another idea i had was to explore the decision of joining the allies by italy in the first world war . 
  shh you know what i meant . 
  here in italy everyone has a bidet . 
  it 's only our ~ ~ barbaric ~ ~ rustic northern neighbours that do not use them . 
  the only ones that can bully finland are other europeans !, 
  the whole world is having less and less children , in just 10 years africa went from 5-6 children for woman to 3-4 . 
  it 's not something that is hitting only the west , here we just notice it more because it was already pretty low . 
  why socialism ? 
  it 's usually the right obsessed over protecting the european race and `` family values '', 
   because that always works out great . 
  why have a government at all sure r/anarcho _ capitalism and r/goldandblack would like to have a word with you . 
  edit : i suggest to use those subreddits exclusively as source of entertainment . 
  they are silly places . 
  [ xeno scum ] ( http://memestorage.com/_nw/71/03375614.png ) recruiting again, 
  and we are 16 ^ th ... meh i thought worse . 
  it 's pretty embarrasing however that we are 24 ^ th in culture considering we have in our country half the world heritage sites . 
  also 40 ^ th in science . 
  i 'm sure leonardo da vinci is proud of us . 
  why is luxemburg 100 ^ th in international peace and security ? 
  i do n't remember any country recently invaded by them ... 
  wow there 's a whole article about pizza 's history . 
  well the legend says the first pizza `` margherita '' has these ingredients as a homage to the italian royal family . 
  margherita of savoy was the then queen of italy and had the new dish dedicated to her . 
  we were coming out of one of the biggest corruption scandals in our history . 
  [ mani pulite ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mani_pulite ) or clean hands . 
  right after a big war between the government and the mafia . 
  berlusconi was the product of a decade of government instability and this was the effect on our economy . 
  well that is true for every nation . 
  and southern italy was called magna graecia by the greek colonists . 
  italia was the entire peninsula up to modern day romagna, 
  what do you mean exactly ? 
  now i want a fanfiction fo this . 
  hold on i 'm going to r/writingprompts, 
  roman egypt was actually one of the richest provinces . 
  the roman occupation made the country prosper like never before , if not under the old egyptian kingdom . 
  and the germans and the turks and the russians ... 
  yeah . 
  our modern set of values all centred around greed is much better than the old one centred around pride . 
  while i 'm not gon na dispute the fact that romans were a militaristic society , they were far less violent than many other civilizations . 
  you ca n't govern a graveyard after all and the romans did it for a thousand years, 
  oh i do n't know sorry . 
  i was only trying to make a joke . 
   the average briton is n't willing to do because they do not give enough to live on . 
  it 's not like people like to be lazy even if there are open jobs , but it 's much better for a business owner to hire an immigrant that wo n't demand decent working conditions than a native . 
  cough ... r/alternativeleft /,
