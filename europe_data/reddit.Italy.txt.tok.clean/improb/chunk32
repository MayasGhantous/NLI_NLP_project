  i am at the uni and i have practically never applied for a job and i am aware of this and i think that the average worker should be aware of it but apparently it is n't, 
  this kinda confirms my point . 
  in short words , one could say he 's an eastern european version of berlusconi, 
  agreed, 
  tunisia , albania , bosnia and indonesia would like a word with you, 
  we do n't record ethnicity but baranzate , a suburb of milan has 31,7 % of its residents being non italian citizens , while rocca de giorgi , a hamlet in the oltrepo wineyards , has 33,3 % of non italian citizens ( mainly romanians ), 
  the principlist which are the main ayatollah supporters and the most conservative group have been losing elections for a while now . 
  this year , they got 28 % of votes , which is still a sizeable amount but it seems they had more well know candidates unlike the reformers . 
  as relations with the west , embargo gets lifted and economy improve , reformers will gain even more votes, 
   that does n't contradict the idea though . 
  most people probably do believe that if a native and a foreigner both have the same qualifications for a job , the native should be given priority . 
  the problem is establishing what having the same qualifications means because it 's unlikely that two curriculums are exactly the same . 
  aside from that , if y ( the foreigner ) and x ( the british ) have the same qualifications but y has more experience in the field and i am searching someone that has this experience , i would give y the job but according to this law , x would get the job . 
  a sad day for hungary . 
  it probably wo n't cease to exist but it will become just another right wing newspaper and a large section of hungarian people wo n't be represented while orban will control a larger and larger section of the medias, 
  we are n't `` banning '' right wing newspapers and organizations though . 
  heck , the right wing is in government in many places . 
  aside from that , not all v4 countries seem to be `` banning left '' wing newspapers and organizations . 
  only poland and hungary . 
  slovakia and czech republic are even led by left wingers although they do n't sound very left wing when they talk . 
  if that 's what it is , it really is n't bothering but a british user below seems to have given a different answer : /, 
  yep , i know . 
  i wanted to make a joke about the balkans but it did n't fit and i forgot to delete albania, 
  did n't know . 
  i guess i will leave it there . 
  i thought relationships between your country and serbia were rougher for some reason . 
  my mistake , i was about to do it about the balkans , then got to romania and bulgaria and saw that it would n't have worked, 
  chaves nationalized everything , everyone and his mother in venezuela without really creating cooperatives and giving it to the people . 
  he used left wing policies as a pretext to improve his own political and maybe even economical standing . 
  i have no proof chaves himself was a kleptocrat but many members of his party and allies were and turned venezuela into a kleptocracy, 
  that 's too far into history to make a prediction about it . 
  it depends on which side of the republicans would have won . 
  if communists had won , the eastern block would have been strenghtened and there would have been chances italy and greece might have gone the same way as spain after ww2 ( if it would have still happened as we know it ) . 
  if anarchists had won , who knows . 
  if democratic forces had won , then the western bloc would have been strenghtened after ww2 ( it is likely they might have abstained from ww2 if it would have happened and for the same reasons franco did ), 
  that 's the thing that surprised me ... ... ... ... . 
  i would love for some company to run a poll on this, 
   it would also get lots of public support . 
  certainly not a support so high . 
  if people wanted this kind of policy making , they would be voting the northern league or brothers of italy . 
  instead , these parties are stuck at 12 % and 4 % . 
   i hope that we will see those papers and that this forcefull takeover wo n't happen because it demolishes the eu 's ownership principle . 
  neither serbia and kosovo are in the eu , so does eu law matter in this specific case ? 
  i 'm just curious about the whole issue, 
  a kleptocracy hands an award named after a kleptocrat ( i ca n't believe fellow left wingers still idolize him ) to the president of a kleptocracy and a kleptocrat himself, 
  that 's sad , especially when 51 % of labour and 59 % of british voters support this . 
  that would be a discriminatory practice or would open the way to such things at least . 
  it seems to me that this brexit talk is just getting more extreme instead of trying to offer workable moderate solutions . 
  that 's a good development as it incentives car manifacturers to invest more in research , it reduces dependency on oil and gas most of which is coming from middle east and russia and reduces ecological footprint slowing down climate change, 
  this could actually making them more competitive on the market in the long run as they have to speed up research on how to make batteries cheaper and more convenient, 
  i disagree . 
  if i am on vacation over a whole week or take a break from reddit , chances are that i wo n't know about several of the news that are there, 
  would be good to go further into depth about an issue . 
  we have the weekly news recap threads but they are not as successful as they should be, 
   it is nowhere close to an actual far left echo chamber , atleast from my personal experience it seems to me that whoever blames anything slightly left of center to be far left has a detached view of reality . 
  the best deal for both parties would be for both eu citizens in uk and for british citizens in eu countries to be offered citizenship for free . 
  i hope good sense can prevail, 
  unfortunately , more and more people look at things in the most simplistic possible way instead of examining an issue in depth and the medias are playing along . 
  now it 's a battle for being the first at reporting something . 
  it does n't matter how well it is reported . 
  if it causes outrage , the better, 
  is n't chemnitz one of the cities with the lowest amount of immigrants ? 
  as far as i know , most of the immigrants there until recently were vietnamese and east europeans, 
  it 's still a sizeable number . 
  you have a point though , in fact i think she 's just standing up because no one from the remain side is doing it vocally . 
  this is a smart move from a political point of view and it fits with her pro-eu and pro independence strategy, 
  can anyone explain me why they would support list of foreign workers ? 
  i just want a tldr about the whole issue . 
  it seems a step too far even for the average brexiter but it seems that a majority of british people ( even the ones who voted remain ) support it, 
   fascists made up an absolutely tiny percentage of members of the right-wing and nationalist coalition which suceeded . 
  yep , it was nationalists , monarchists and conservatives ( mostly close to the church ) who made the bulk of the revolution, 
  i wonder how things would have gone had the republicans won . 
  i think there could have been another civil war between communists , anarchists and democratic forces . 
  what 's more interesting is to see if hitler would have been discouraged by a loss of the nationalists in spain, 
   step 4 : do n't get bombed out in ~ ~ ww2 ~ ~ ww3 . 
  ftfy, 
  the average iranian is more liberal than the average pakistani . 
  the place has a good potential to become a democratic country . 
  the ayatollah are the only thing standing in the way but maybe as time goes they could just be transformed in figure heads , especially if a more moderate ayatollah is chosen . 
  the constitution would have to be changed first though, 
  they will never become iran 2.0 . 
  what erdogan aspires to be is putin 's russia and he 's slowly succeeding to turn turkey into an illiberal democracy . 
  chp is the last obstacle on the way and their opposition was indirectly weakened by the coup because they had to side with erdogan on the issue and were outshadowed by him losing part of their support . 
  this brings further light on the incompetence of the belgian authorities . 
  i hope they have learned their lesson because this general show of incompetence may turn out to be a magnet for islamic terrorists from all over europe, 
  in my experience , big scale enterpreneurs have never brought anything good to politics . 
  they are just defending their own interests through politics, 
  why does it always have to be either cinque terre or some central tuscan hilltop town that represents italy in these kind of articles ? 
  we have several building styles varying from region to region : * [ marzamemi ] ( http://www.marzamemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/slide_2.jpg ) , southern sicily * [ nicosia ] ( http://www.mondodelgusto.it/gallery/3036.jpgg ) , nebrodi mountains * [ scilla ] ( http://www.bboasis.it/images/scilla/6.jpg ) , southern calabria * [ gerace ] ( http://www.strettoweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gerace-dallalto.jpg ) , southern calabria * [ ostuni ] ( http://www.comune.ostuni.br.it/files/upload/portaleslide/immagine/91f12b651efad0ca1f49871f9541d57b_citta-bianca.jpg ) , salento * [ alberobello ] ( http://www.touringclub.it/sites/default/files/immagini_georiferite/alberobello3.jpg ) , valle d'itria * [ bovino ] ( http://www.immediato.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bovino.jpg ) , daunia mountains * [ monte sant ` angelo ] ( http://www.statoquotidiano.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/montesantangelo-comune.jpg ) , gargano * [ procida ] ( http://www.viaggiaincampania.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/corricella.jpg ) , gulf of napoli * [ buccino ] ( https://meravigliosacampania.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/buccino.jpg ) , central campania this is just southern italy, 
  it 's cold here too , at least for our standards . 
  minimum of 11c \u00b0 today . 
  consider that i live close to the adriatic coast of southern italy so it was colder elsewhere . 
  temps have gotten as low as 5c \u00b0 in udine and down to -6 c \u00b0 in the highest alpine town . 
  still no snow though but [ here 's the forecast for livigno ] ( http://www.3bmeteo.com/meteo/livigno ), 
  this is ... ... . ridiculous especially when coming from two parliamentians who support both the same party and the same way of doing politics, 
   well , i for one , was expecting more from the 48 % . 
  instead you have jeremy corbyn who from my perspective looks like he either does n't care at all or might even be an accomplice of the whole disaster . 
  i expected the lib dems support to surge , instead they are still at 8-9 % and several remainers still blindly support the tories and labour ( it must be said that the traditional northern labour voter has a point in voting against the eu ), 
  they are as nationalist as the republicans in the usa , subtly but they still are . 
  they have entered the russian army and have attacked from within,
