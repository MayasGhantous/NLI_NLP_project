  article deleted for the meanwhile . 
  unfortunately , this is true to any country but recently the idea that anything muslim is not good has made inroads in many people . 
  the far right is being legitimized after the recent terrorist attacks ( and erdogan 's crack on opposition newspapers is n't helping either as is the fact that most in the west still think the coup was made by some kind of secular force ) and xenophobes are more and more vocal . 
  i did bring a few articles to the table at least even though your claim had nothing to do with the subject of the article . 
  if you do n't ( or ca n't ) disprove what i am saying , it means that i am right to the neutral reader and that to him pis will be validated as a far right party and that poland 's political sphere will be considered the most right wing of europe by him . 
  i was reading english cumhuriyet 's front page ( was just curious if they were still running ) when i saw it and did n't check it was old . 
  that makes it much more believable . 
  at the same time , it kinda confirms that campania is the region with the lowest actual employment rate . 
  is there article coupled by the stat by the way ? 
  i would be interested in reading it, 
   even we secular turks are tired of europeans hating on us by now . 
  we just ca n't stand the way turkey is going . 
  turkey matters to us because we see it as an example that democracy can work in the muslim world . 
  we are n't attacking turkey or turkish people ( the right does that sometimes ) as much as we are attacking erdogan and akp, 
  you 'll have to wait for that . 
  he 's still fairly young and in good shape, 
  third world country we are not . 
  according to the [ human development index ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/2014_un_human_development_report_quartiles.svg ) , we are a very developed country . 
  [ they even list us \\ ( 0.873 \\ ) over poland \\ ( 0.843 \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) . 
  i wo n't deny that there is corruption but [ more people reported paying a bribe in poland ] ( http://www.transparency.org/country#pol_publicopinion ) than in [ italy ] ( http://www.transparency.org/country#ita_publicopinion ) . 
  there are datas when your country does better and datas where mine does better but that does n't mean either italy or poland are third world countries either way , you are avoiding to prove my point wrong changing the discours entirely . 
  i proved you wrong , now it 's your time to prove my point wrong . 
  made me really laugh . 
  the song is really spot on and german satire show seem more high quality than ours ( at least from this song ; [ the best we have is crozza ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kte16cmqrve ) ), 
  we already tried but you did n't want it to happen , 
  prove me wrong then . 
  poland is europe 's most right wing country . 
  that ca n't be denied . 
  there is n't a single leftist party in parliament . 
  the most left you have is basically a liberal europeist centrist party . 
  making the steps that are needed to enter the eu would mean a series of reforms that would lead to a further improvement of the political situation in your country . 
  all of non akp voters ( except kurdish nationalists ) should support entering the eu . 
  leaving the muslim world for eu should be a positive development to all kemalists at the very least, 
   also the syrian arab army has decayed considerably to the point it no longer exists in practice , it has even lost control of the warlords who acted on behalf of assad : the saa certainly exists . 
  it may be weaker but if we count the ndf which is basically counter insurgency/reserve force , they have a much larger number of soldiers than rebels do . 
   the current battles in aleppo at the moment are almost entirely between rebels and foreign shi'ite militia working on behalf of the regime - there 's no functional saa on the front lines anymore . 
  that 's not right . 
  liwa al quds ( palestinian syrian group ) , tiger forces and desert hawks ( multi-confessional elite troops ) and parts of saa 's 1st , 4th and republican guard elite unit are all fighting . 
  by the way , rebels also make a large use of foreign fighters . 
  the suicide bombers in the current aleppo offensive are all foreigners as are most of their shock troops . 
  how can you say things as your last sentence with a straight face ? 
  and how can you support the rebels without being an islamist ? 
  indeed , the eu has prepared some kind of road map for turkey to follow and erdogan is going in the opposition way on many of the policies needed to enter into the eu, 
  even a broken clock is right two times a day, 
  he 's turkey 's putin . 
  as simple as that . 
  whether a place 's well controlled or not , in the midst of a war , has little to do with the number of deaths but with local economy and how its government controls its citizens . 
  most of the rebel groups have proven to be warlordish . 
  the regime does n't make things easier of course ( by the way , i think unhrc numbers are exaggerated , especially given that un council is controlled by saudi arabia at the moment and that they are a huge backer of the opposition ) and i would argue their war conduct has n't been good at all but in this war , all of the sides ( with maybe the notable exception of sdf ) have committed their fair share of atrocities edit : [ the most realistic number of losses is probably the one included in wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casualties_of_the_syrian_civil_war ), 
  i wonder how these figures would look if cash-in-hand jobs were accounted . 
   quite a few muslim women left france because they could n't live without the burka . 
  seems like we solved that problem . 
  i think this phenomenon is called hijra and is encouraged by salafists and ultraconservative sunnis . 
   the extremists , `` ready for action '' , work in cells anyway . 
  what 's more problematic is what i see in germany here . 
  wahhabi and salafi fundamentalists are already shun by many almost every `` mainstream '' mosque here . 
  they are pretty much outcast - but they 've found other ways , lecturing via video and internet streams , private gatherings and on the street these days . 
  unfortunately , the internet has gave a voice to pretty much any extremist , whether salafi , marxist or neo-nazi , ecc . 
  but it still limits their action, 
  look at the bright side . 
  the sultan will be replaced with a new ataturk 8 years after we will win our war . 
  that 's why he should have kept his mouth shut in the first place . 
  if he cared so much , he could have done something . 
  instead , he transformed southern turkey into the waiting room for entry into is, 
  it literally was syrian al qaeda . 
   jabhat fateh al-sham ( arabic : \u062c\u0628\u0647\u0629 \u0641\u062a\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645 , transliteration : jabhat fat\u1e25 ash-sh\u0101m , `` front for the conquest of the levant '' ) , formerly known as the al-nusra front ( arabic : \u062c\u0628\u0647\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0635\u0631\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645 , transliteration : jabhat an-nu\u1e63rah li-ahli ash-sh\u0101m , `` the victory front for the people of the levant '' , often abbreviated to jn ) , al-qaeda in syria , or al-qaeda in the levant , [ 39 ] is a salafist jihadist terrorist organization fighting against the forces of the syrian government in the syrian civil war , with the aim of establishing an islamic state in the country . 
  [ 40 ] it was the syrian branch of al-qaeda until 2016, 
  nah , it 's more of a case of poland having its political scene unnaturally tilted towards right than pis not being far right poland is europe 's most right wing country . 
  do n't you realize that ? 
  only hungary comes close and maybe slovakia . 
  as an italian , sounds a good enough reason to invade you . 
  it 'll be 1912 all over again ... ... 
  many have returned blending in with legitimate refugees or with economic migrants but if turkey had a stricter control on their border with syria , foreign fighters both could n't have gotten to or returned from syria in the first place, 
  depends . 
  some regime held areas probably are but the main cities of damascus , hama , homs , ecc . 
  have strict state control ( even though at the start of the war , syrian government had to rely on militias and secret services ) the difference with rebel held areas is that there 's no main authority and that there 's a frequent infighting between the various groups . 
  a rebel win would basically mean another civil war between the winners . 
  a regime win would mean the end of the war . 
  the lack of resources has also made warlordism pretty common in places like aleppo . 
   pis is neither right or nationalist . 
  of course they are . 
  using both hardline conservative and nationalist rhetoric as well as having authoritarian tendencies . 
  the only established parties who are more right wing within the eu are hungary 's jobbik , greece 's golden dawn and slovakia 's lsns, 
  italy has slightly gone up to 56,5 % . 
  still above only croatia and greece . 
   in calabria for example inactive people are even twice the unemployed ones , what 's the point in fully trusting unemployment rate if it interests just 1/3 of the people without a ( declared ) job ? 
  that can easily be explained by the prevalence of undeclared ( under the table ) jobs in southern regions . 
  i think they fair well in the game making industry too but of course their biggest contribution is porn , 
  even areas with few romas such as trencin , kosice , zilina have all unemployment rates around 10 % . 
  to add to that , i think romas would n't be counted in an unemployment rate because the ones who have n't integrated usually do n't search a job, 
  i think age of consent should be raised to 16 or 18 in case one of the two persons involved has an authoritative role as in this case but the court just applied the law in this case , as flawed as it is . 
  i think for 14 and above , it 's called ephebophilia by the way , i do n't see why incest should n't be legal if two persons , whether they are male or female , want it . 
  it should be made illegal only if it 's under the age of 18 where the parent can exercise control on its children . 
  of course , mine is probably an unpopular view . 
   somalia is a failed state libya and rebel ( the so called `` moderate '' groups ) held areas of syria as well, 
  [ all the while they remove the syrian branch of al qaeda ( al nusra ) from their terror list ] ( http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/english/84325/turkey_removes_al-nusra_from__terror__list.html ) and while their special forces fight side to side [ with groups like zinki who have beheaded a child as recently as three months ago ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36843990 ), 
  it 's kinda the opposite though . 
  going overtly against him is only going to worsen the view of many turks towards the west . 
  we should just fund the opposition ( hdp , chp and try to rid mhp of bahceli if possible before funding them too ) and take a stand against the closing of newspapers, 
  exactly , they want to keep a good relationship with the west because they have realized it 's a good tool to spread sympathy towards kurdistan 's fight for autonomy .
