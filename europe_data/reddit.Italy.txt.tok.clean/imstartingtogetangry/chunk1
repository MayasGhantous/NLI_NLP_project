it does n't make any sense it absolutely does , it 's not even hard to understand : * we * 're the enemy , so * they * attack us . 
  the sooner we accept that there is indeed an ** us ** and a ** they ** , the better . 
  well , that 's a bit extreme . 
  it 's enough to get it out of europe . 
  it 's feels good to have your worldview confirmed , even if it 's a pessimistic worldview . 
  why * should n't * people use an atrocity to push a political agenda ? 
  it 's something that 's always happened , and it seems like a pretty normal thing to do . 
  do you think it was wrong for roosevelt to give the infamy speech after pearl harbor ? 
  do you find it odd to be more afraid of brown people ? 
  'cause it 's pretty common . 
  leftists do n't love muslims , they just hate themselves . 
  people do n't keep their political ideas throughout their lives , they become more conservative as they get old . 
  this idea that progressivism will eventually win because all the non-progressives are going to die out is absolutely moronic . 
  that 's what usually happen when people notice they have been moving in the wrong direction for a while . 
  why is it odd ? 
  like , why would n't want to kill a serial killer , for example ? 
  parents who do n't spank their children , should be spanked themselves . 
  you 're trying to argue that the past was not absolute shit and that modernity is not superior in every possible way . 
  this is like , the closest thing to blasphemy , to a liberal . 
  have an upvote !, 
  death penalty and corporal punishment are really good ideas . 
  at the individual level , sure . 
  but as a people , they did n't originate in europe , and more importantly do n't share the one unifying trait europe ever had , christianity . 
  that 's not how hate works . 
  turkey ** is ** europe but the turks are not europeans . 
  nope , i buy it from people who do n't live with me . 
  just like countries can trade with each other without being in a union . 
  there is a good reason we have many small houses in which we live alone or with our families , and not huge collective houses in which to live together . 
  i have no dream of living with everyone else . 
  mad respect for this dude . 
  people better get used to it , because this is the future . 
  exactly , anyone who is n't a normal human being . 
  good analogy , but italy was unified by a monarchy through war and afterward , since there were no italians , it required quite a bit of violent repression . 
  i honestly doubt a liberal and democratic eu can achieve the same . 
  yep , it 's a nationalistic project without a national identity behind it . 
  and because of that , it 's doomed to fail . 
  and what 's wrong with arbitrary limits ? 
  borders are arbitrary , should we allow anyone to come and go as they please ? 
  the age of consent is arbitrary , should we legalize pedophilia ? 
  because europeans are white , and back in the day people used to be sane enough to not buy into this `` diversity '' nonsense . 
  firstly , things have identities too , otherwise you could n't tell them apart . 
  most importantly , groups - such as countries - have identities , and they need them in order to exist . 
  secondly , identity is n't choosen ; what you are is largely independent from what you want . 
  consequently , shared identity is not the result of a convergent choice ( which does n't take place ) , but rather is enforced with discriminating practices : a group has an identity because the outgroup is kept outside ( segregation ) and the ingroup is forced to conform ( normative social control ) ; shared identity is thus ( inevitably ) lost due to * excessive liberty * . 
  those of each european country . 
   what exactly do you see being destroyed in this process ? 
  identity, 
  it 's funny because the age of hard nationalism and strongest divisions strangely coincides with the age of greatest competitiveness . 
  on the one hand , i hope they get out of the uk , because all people deserve independence . 
  fuck supernational unions . 
  on the other hand , i hope they vote to stay , just for the salt in reddit . 
  they 're nothing if not consistent . 
   the modern left lol no , they 've been using `` fascist '' as a generic insult since the 40s . 
  orwell wrote , in * what is fascism * :  * `` it will be seen that , as used , the word ` fascism ' is almost entirely meaningless . 
  in conversation , of course , it is used even more wildly than in print . 
  i have heard it applied to farmers , shopkeepers , social credit , corporal punishment , fox-hunting , bull-fighting , the 1922 committee , the 1941 committee , kipling , gandhi , chiang kai-shek , homosexuality , priestley 's broadcasts , youth hostels , astrology , women , dogs and i do not know what else . 
  why ? 
  those subs are not perfect by any means , but at least are a way to get out of the liberal pens\u00e9e unique . 
  because people never kick their gay family members out , and having jew neighbors and coworkers totally prevented them from being dehumanized last time ... 
  anyway , complacency is good . 
  keep it up . 
  nothing bad will happen . 
  i agree with everything except this :  it really baffles my mind how non-retarded people can support such ideas . 
  why ? 
  history clearly shows that those are the ideas that normal human beings support . 
  we 're not rational peace-loving creatures , we 're tribalistic and violent af . 
  it boggles my mind that we managed to maintain peace for so long in europe !, 
  in austria a guy who was described as a literal nazi ( then again , everyone is literally hitler nowdays ) almost won the election . 
  if i wa a minority , i 'd be scared right now . 
  intolerance is growing everywere due to the migrand crisis . 
  now , you could argue that intolerance of foreigners is different from intolerance of homosexuals , but let 's not kid ourselves , intolerance does n't stop at one kind of minority . 
  it 's not an ideology , it 's a mode of thinking . 
   you think countries that have already legalized ssm will go back and ban it again ? 
  yes . 
   would love to hear your opinions on why that would happen . 
  because of a shift in public opinion . 
  in particular , a shift away from the ideology of diversity and tolerance . 
   what specific countries do you think would do that ? 
  too specific . 
   many of them have over 80 % or over 90 % support . 
  50 years ago it would have been 10-20 % , and this shows that such attitudes can change really fast . 
  yeah , they 're almost as respected as politicians . 
  in 30 years this map will shows a lot more red and less blue . 
  the wind is changing . 
   being a former banker ... it 's a generally well respected profession . 
  is it , though ? 
  beautiful . 
  it 's also interesting how a woman does n't need to show much skin to be attractive . 
   moroccans and algerians then complained that they too were kicked out of spain during the reconquista well , that was the point , was n't it ? 
  minorities are never safe , and never will . 
  in sweden too . 
  edit : and spain . 
  this much is not in question , everyone agrees . 
  but it just means that _ the only unethical actions are immoral actions _ , because to decide whether an action has a net negative result is to make an evaluation , and this requires - and is relative to - a moral system ( which ca n't be inferred from facts with reason , because of the is/ought problem ) . 
  the problem is that your morality is your base , unquestioned assumption and you universalize it . 
  this is not strange , everyone does the same , but your morality is strange and absolutely not universal , and there is no way around it : there 's never been , in our knowledge , a culture that did n't think that incest produces a net negative for society ( a.k.a. 
  is immoral ) . 
  because of this ? 
   if there is one universal moral rule , it 's that incest is wrong i did n't mean to say it 's literally the only one , just that it 's certainly one . 
  maybe it got lost in translation .
