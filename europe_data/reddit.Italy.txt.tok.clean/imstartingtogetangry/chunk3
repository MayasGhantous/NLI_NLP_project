  firstly , it 's based on biological differences , which are the reason why same-sex marriage is n't common across cultures ( and if something is truly arbitrary , you 're expect exactly this , large cultural variation ) . 
  secondly , it 's based on our specific tradition and history , which is not something we should , or could , just gloss over . 
  we 're not generic human beings , we 're members and inheritors of a culture which shaped us , and we ca n't free ourselves from it . 
   it 's not like we perform mandatory fertility check before marriage , which clearly proves the correct genitals are not needed in order to be able to marry . 
  we do n't perform mandatory maturity checks before declaring someone of legal age , even though people do develop at different speed ; instead , we enstablish a universal age of majority irrespective to individual variation . 
  it 's a useful generalization to say that people below 18 are immature and people above that age are mature , even though there are ecceptions . 
  and likewise , it 's a useful generalization to say that stright couples are fertile and same sex couples are not . 
   there is no benefit in having two separate legal principles for de facto identical situations . 
  the benefit is the defense and perpetuation of heteronormativity . 
  which is good because we need social norms to function properly , and we 're destroying all of them . 
   law should be lightweight and as ease to understand as possible . 
  we have n't had any problem understanding and applying marriage until now . 
   you are a homophobic , rassist cunt you forgot sexist . 
   without any argument nah , there are argument , you just ignore them cause they go against your narrative . 
  * intolerant people * is redundant . 
  it 's either that or the fall of the west . 
  liberalism is self-destructive in the long run . 
   maybe we should illegalise divorce , in-vitro fertilisation , yes , definitely . 
  i 'm saying that your legal options are always limited by the circumstances you 're in , and this is only a violation of equality before the law if the circumstance is arbitrary and irrelevant to the discrimination . 
  but sex is relevant to marriage , as the primary function of marriage is to enstablish legal paternity . 
   and it 's a problem of equality before the law . 
  assume you have a partner you want to spend rest of your life with . 
  if only traditional marriage is permitted then your legal options ** depend on your sex ** . 
  and this would be a problem of equality if sex was irrelevant to the situation . 
  but this is n't the case . 
   why should moral non-conformity be punished ? 
  because society - and thus our wellbeing - requires a measure of conformity , and this does n't happen by itself , it needs to be enforced . 
  if everyone have a different morality , it 's impossible to reach any agreement or to predict people 's behavior . 
   that is fascism-like . 
  it does . 
  it also sounds like theocracy , feudalism , absolute monarchy , and literally every non-liberal social system ; and even liberal and democratic societies have a great deal of it ( just look at how are racists treated ) . 
  generally speaking , it 's always been far more common to punish non-conformity than to tolerate or accept it . 
   sure , when two consenting humans want to sex each other , they should be allowed , i just want to point out that this is not obvious ( as implied by * sure * ) . 
  it 's a political opinion , and one not shared by the majority of people throughout history . 
  in fact , even nowdays , almost nobody agree with the principle that consenting adults should be allowed to do what the want to each other . 
   zero evidence is needed to justify adherence to the principle of equality before the law why ? 
  also , equality before the law only means equal treatment for equal situation . 
  opposite-sex couple and same-sex couple are not in the same situation , so it does n't follow from the general principle that the latter should be allowed to marry because the former are . 
   how is non-conformity inherently good ? 
  i do n't think it is , i think it 's really bad and should be punished . 
   how is solidarity meassured , since when is it objective ? 
  i do n't know . 
  how is social capital measured ? 
  those are fuzzy concept , but nontheless real . 
  i expect anomie , because this ( heteronormativity ) is just another norm we 're destroying in our liberating furor . 
  which is really agood thing , is n't it ? 
  it 's not like heterogeneity reduces social cohesion and solidariety . 
  i honestly wonder , why do we have an instinct to conform and to dislike non-conformists , if non-conformity is such a good thing for us ? 
  favouring your ingroup ( family , friends , neightboors , country , and race too ) over the outgroup is definitely a good thing , and it was always seen as such . 
   historically we have lived in racist , misogynistic , vastly unequal societies . 
  so because according to you , since we do n't have the `` mental faculties '' to not live like that , we should just accept it ? 
  yes , absolutely . 
  in fact group loyalty ( racism ) , traditional gender roles ( misogyny , even if there is no hate involved ) and justice ( socioeconomic inequality ) are all morally good things . 
  why would we get rid of them ( even if we could , and we ca n't ) ? 
   i mean , let 's take it further : for the absolute majority of homo sapiens ' time on this planet , we have been hunter-gatherers . 
  since that 's the social environment we 've lived in the most , if anything that 's the one our primitive brains are wired into , should we go back to that ? 
  nice black and white thinking , but a limitation to our ability to adapt to new enviroment is not the same as a complete inability to do the same . 
  we can adapt to some extent , but since we 're not born in a blank slate , we ca n't adapt to everything . 
  yes . 
  let 's end private property and institute communism , the only consequence will be economic equality !, 
  social change is always positive s /, 
  that 's exactly my point . 
  there is n't plenty of data because same sex marraige was first legalized 16 years ago in netherland . 
  that 's a really short time ago , and yet people are sure there wo n't be any negative consequences . 
  more than a decare = / = long time . 
  and yeah , societies are falling apart , as they 're less and less homogenous . 
   denmark has had same-sex unions ( civil partnership ) since 1989 . 
  almost 30 years . 
   the netherlands have had same-sex marriage since 2000 . 
  more than 15 years . 
   neither country has imploded . 
  not a long time at all . 
  100 or 200 years would be closer to the * long term * . 
   quite on the contrary , actually . 
  studies show that recognition of same-sex unions and other lgbt rights reduce suicide and depression among the younger lgbt generation , while children brought up in same-sex households are just as happy as those in different-sex households . 
  and yet the countries which legalized same sex marriage are also the ones with the greatest consumption of antidepressant . 
  i wonder if there is a correlation ... 
   allow consenting adults to do whatever they want while not hurting anyone else 's rights and this is definitely a good thing , because of course historically we 've always lived in such a social enviroment , and as a result we surely evolved the mental faculties to prosper in it . 
  i do n't know what they will be , but it 's very unlikely there will be none . 
   because in some cases viloence now stops massive viloence and brutality later . 
  moral considerations aside , this only works when you 're the strongest . 
  otherwise your violence fails , and it just legitimizes an equally ( or more ) violent retaliation . 
  imo , he does n't inspire the same kind of hatred . 
  would it be just to tax everyone for 1 $ and give the revenue to me ? 
  for me , it would be millions , but everyone else would n't even notice it . 
  but really , my problem is the underlying materialistic assumption that only money matter , and this idea is simply not shared by everybody . 
  many people value public morality , and many people find homosexuality to be immoral ; and legalization of same sex marriage does affect them , even if not their finance . 
  then again , if it did n't affect them , they would not oppose it . 
  the whole narrative of `` it only affects some '' is an outright denial of the point of view of the opposition , which is delegitimized as petty and egoistical at best , and evil at worst . 
  i 'd totally pay to listen him say renzi is the spawn of satan . 
  `` i refuse to go along with this and see throught all your lies matteo renzi you wicked , wicked devil ( goes supersayan ) '', 
   not necessarely true . 
  we are perfectly capable of organizing horizontally . 
  can you point to any large-scale long-lasting horizontally-organized society ? 
   if this were true anyone who did n't own slaves could sue the government for violating their rights and insodoing force the government to provide them with slaves . 
  no one has a right to specific property , merely property in a general sense . 
  exactly . 
  there used to be a right ** in the general sense ** to own slaves . 
  now , this right has been abolisched , and you ca n't own slaves at all . 
   there is , of course and as i said , a process to modify and review past understandings of rights , but it is not a simple democratic up down majority vote .
