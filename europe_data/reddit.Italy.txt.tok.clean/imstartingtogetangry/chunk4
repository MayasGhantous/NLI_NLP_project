  it requires multiple branches of multiple bodies of government , and at least in the states super majority or three-fifths majority to do so . 
  this is true for the us . 
  but what about human right ? 
  can those be modified or abloshed , once they 're recognized ? 
   how is need a personal characteristic ? 
  it merely describes the present state of one 's finances . 
  that is not part of who you are as a person . 
  it is not immutable . 
  what about discrimination against muslims ? 
  religion is not immutable and it 's not a part of the individual , it 's just a descriptor of his current believes . 
   and those who are wealthy have never been historically denied equality . 
  in fact they 're the ones doing the denying . 
  who cares ? 
  the point of equality is not to rectify some historical inequality , it 's a value in and of itself . 
  ok . then same sex marriage also affects everyone , as it costs money to the state ( for example , for the inheritance of pensions ) , and this means cutting services or increasing taxes . 
  so , no votes to increase the taxes for the 1 % ? 
  no votes to abolish slavery ? 
  you say as if it 's strange to find weird and unusual things disgusting . 
  incest between adult siblings ( 100 % infertile ) . 
  sex with a deceased animal ( with no risk of disease ) . 
  sex between a normal man and a woman who took hormones that prevented her from entering puberty ( she looks like a child ) . 
  do you find any of those things disgusting ? 
   for the people that do own homes there are discussions about property rights , but those are not human rights it is a different matter all together . 
  from the universal declaration of human rights : [ article 17 . 
  ( 1 ) everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others . 
  ( 2 ) no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property . 
  ] ( http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ ) anyway it 's not important whether it 's * human right * or just a * legal right * , there is a right to own property , and it used to include a right to own slaves ( as slaves were seen as commodities ) . 
  this was changed when people decided it was monstrous , and this proves that sometimes rights need to be revoked . 
  another example is the right husbands used to have , to have sex with their wives regardless of their consent ; now , we see it as rape . 
  this all shows we need a way to review `` human rights '' , otherwise we would be perpetually bound to the choices our ancestors made . 
   i do not see how providing assistance only to those who need assistance is similar to allowing one group of people to access a public licensing based upon the characteristics of their person while denying it to another . 
  it 's similar because `` need '' is a personal characteristic as much as homosexuality . 
   here in america slavery was once legal but no person had a right to own slaves . 
  no person has a right to own a house , but houses are still object of property rights . 
  in the us , could slaveowners be arbitrarely deprived of their slaves ? 
  if not , then they indeed had a right to their slaves . 
   may i ask how providing services on the basis of need is discrimination to those not in need ? 
  that 's a strange question . 
  it 's a service provided to some and not others , that 's what discrimination is , differential treatment . 
  this is like asking how allowing only stright people to marry is discrimination to gay people . 
   but if someone like this really gets into power , who can realistically stop them from enacting their policies ? 
  by that time , it would be too late , but they can be stopped from getting into power . 
  for example , non-liberal parties could be outlawed ( in italy it 's illegal to reconstruct the fascist party ) and non-liberal speach may be censored ( i believe in germany a lot of nazy-themed speech is illegal ) . 
   the policies aimed at violating human rights should be condemned by other countries i 'm quite concerned about this idea of `` human rights '' everyone seems to be on board with ( fair warning , i think it 's the most undemocratic idea ever ) . 
  like , what if country a decide that x is a human right , while country b decide that non-x is ; what is the human right , x or non-x ? 
   any democratic constitution says that all adult citizens have the same rights . 
  the us constitution allowed slavery for quite some while , so not all democratic constititutions say that . 
  and constitutions can change : what if a part wanted to put in the constitution that marriage is between a man and a woman ? 
   if a heterosexual couple has the right to marry , then a same sex couple should have it as well . 
  it 's not the couple who has the right , it 's the individuals . 
  and even if gay marriage is n't recognized , gay people still have the exact same * right to marry as stright people . 
  ( * that is , the right to marry people of the opposite sex ), 
   it is not about instating a ` new ' right such as the right to internet access ( which is first recognized democratically and thereafter is to be treated as a right ) ok , so a human right need to be recognized democratically . 
  but afterward , is it unquestionable ? 
  how can it be revised , if the public opinion change ? 
  after all , there was once a time when owning slaves was a right , and it was a popular one . 
   in a situation where certain people are denied equal access to public services that is always a violation of their rights . 
  but there is no human right to equal access to public serivces . 
  for example some countries have means-test welfare , in which certain services are reserved to the poor . 
  that 's a discrimination for sure , but i doubt many people would argue it violate some human right of the rich . 
  a government enacts a law that discriminate against a minority . 
  should a referendum to repeal the law be allowed ? 
  in a country , the rich do n't pay any taxes . 
  should a referendum to make them pay be allowed ? 
  in both cases , the referendum would only concern a minority . 
  sure , but should non-liberals be allowed to partecipate in politics ? 
  what if a non-liberal ( conservative , communist , fascist , whatever ) party gets into power , should they be allowed to enact non-liberal policies ? 
   besides the genitals involved besides a clearly relevant detail they 're exactly the same . 
  it 's important because what they really want is not some legal right , they want a shift in public morality so that homosexuality is no longer seen as `` inferior '' to heterosexuality . 
  what they want is for `` gay '' to no longer be an insult . 
  it 's not going to happen , of course , because some values are not socially constructed and ca n't be changed , but still they try . 
  honest question : why do you care about upvotes ? 
  yeah , because clearly there is a link between the date and the policies a country enacts . 
  you 're implying human rights are not a political concept , that somehow they are objective facts that can be observed ; this clearly is n't the case though , as proven by the fact that people disagree . 
  so , who gets to decide what is a human right ? 
  and what about the non-liberals ? 
   10 people voting on the rights of 1 person sounds like bullying to me . 
  the majority taking decisions which affect the minority is literally all democracy is . 
   plus its such a non-issue its just petty and cruel . 
  it clearly is an issue , otherwise there would agreement . 
   the way i see it is if someone is paying tax they deserve equal rights . 
  yep , that 's how you see it . 
  others disagree . 
   nobody ** should ** be able to decide on whether the government can or can not discriminate a minority . 
  what ** should ** be is an opinion by definition , and since it 's about the government it 's a political opinion . 
  so , what you 're saying , is that democracy is cool only as long as you agree with the result ( or , at least , do n't strongly disagree ) . 
  and the french had a point . 
  had i lived back then , i would not have blamed you for discriminating against us ; rather , i would have been ashamed by the action of my countryman . 
   apart from you , you just said ** muslims ** are incompatable with western culture . 
  i did n't sai that , i said ** islam ** is incompatible . 
  not all muslim subscribe 100 % to their religion . 
  and besides , incompatible = / = terrorism . 
  there are other ways for cultures to clash . 
   either you accept that people should be judged by their actions and not prejudices or you are saying that and you have to try and defend the position that all muslims think x and do y. i do n't accept it at all . 
  ceteris paribus it 's better to judge people as individuals , but the conditions are not the same , as it takes more time and resources to acquire and process specific informations than to apply a prejudice . 
  in some circumstances , it 's just better to use a prejudice , that 's why we have evolved this tendency . 
  not all muslims are terrorists , but imo the cost of being unfair to those who are n't is lower than the benefit of reducing terrorism . 
   i would n't do that with italians even though i have an image in my head of italians being lazy . 
  i think you would do it , in the right situation . 
  i ** hope ** you would do it , for your own good .
