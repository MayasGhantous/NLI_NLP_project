  in theory , he does n't want to enter any coalition, 
  too close . 
  i 'd still smell the stench . 
  yes . 
  homemade . 
  i have my own hens . 
  where do you want to go ? 
  i 'm wondering if the votes have been tampered with , if the statistics are wrong or if we simply live in a country full of idiots . 
  i guess it 's a mix of all of those . 
  i guess it 's decided . 
  i 'll leave this country . 
  then what about alaska ? 
  the point is that everyone would be living on their own , even in the `` southern states '' if they were able to get 750 $ from the state every month . 
  maybe you did n't read well : i do n't have anything against landfills . 
  there 's one near my home . 
  sure , it has its problems , it could get in the water supply , but with incinerators that stuff gets ** in the air ** and spreads around everywhere . 
  incinerators can be built , if they are ** needed ** , once we 've reduced the amount of waste as much as possible , and everyone burns theirs , differently from the `` trash commerce '' going on right now . 
  ** but ** , they need to be correctly managed and controlled , something that i do n't trust my government will do . 
  ** maybe you should re-read my posts and realize that you 're arguing with yourself , not really replying to what i wrote . 
  i think this discussion is a waste of time : of course i do n't think we can recycle 100 % , did you take me for an idiot ? 
  ** but ** , since i live here , i know that an incinerator of that size is not needed for the limited amount of trash produced here , ** and the money spent for building that would be better off spent for improving recycling in the area first ** . 
  ( and here recycling is pretty well established , in some other cities not so much ) so , you say that we have to get rid of this stuff somehow , but how come we have to burn trash , in amounts above the necessary , right in the middle of an important food production area ? 
  oh , and it 's build in an industrial area , but here we have no heavy industries , nothing significant is getting dumped in the air otherwise . 
  do you think i feel any different about special waste being sold as fertilizer in the south ? 
  or being hid in the caverns of the tremiti archipelago ? 
  just because they 're far from me ? 
  i know what that means and it 's offensive , it implies an ignorant attitude on my side . 
  no , i do n't need you to teach me what trash is , thank you . 
  i 've got no problems with landfills , there 's one a couple of kilometers from my home . 
  saying that stuff is n't getting recycled as an argument against recycling is n't very logical . 
  well , for starters i never called you anything so please avoid doing so to me . 
  second , i dislike the concept of incinerators in any place , it 's not a geographical thing . 
  the problem is that there 's too much trash being produced and too little recycling going on . 
  i 've personally had to fight pointlessly excessive ( and stupid ) packaging in my work field , so i 'm sorry , but you do n't know shit about me and your assumptions about my thought process are faulty . 
  that 's absolutely not true . 
  we have landfills and recycling plants . 
  people here actually separate trash in order to minimize `` residual '' trash that has to be buried or burned . 
  the true reason for building this incinerator here is so the local government can make money by burning other regions ' trash . 
  in what 's called `` the food valley '' . 
  it makes no sense . 
  no , i do n't trust the authorities to manage it correctly . 
  this is italy . 
  be it the limits or correct construction , the result will be the same . 
  of course the plant wo n't treat parma 's trash exclusively . 
  italy could greatly improve its recycling practices . 
  and if you think that the area only produces ham and parmigiano you 're mistaken . 
  well , in parma , for example , they are building an incinerator right between barilla 's main plant ( you know barilla , the biggest pasta maker in the world ? ), 
  and chiesi farmaceutica 's plant , which as you may guess is a pharmaceutical company . 
  not to mention the area 's numerous traditional and protected food productions . 
  does n't seem like a good idea to me . 
  do n't know about ireland , but in italy i was taught to finish my plate too , and the reason could either be `` when , during ww2 ... '' or `` think of the starving children in africa ! '', 
  ( as if either of those things could change by eating everything in my plate ), 
  you do n't need to go that far in the past for reasons to finish your plate : you just have to go back to ww2, 
   diesel engines run far hotter and at far higher pressures than an average gasoline engine . 
    pressure and heat both cause engine ware , they are basically less reliable across the board . 
  that 's why they are built sturdier . 
  honestly in my experience diesel are just as reliable ( if not more ) as petrol ones . 
  my car has a diesel engine and 410000km under its belt . 
  the debate has been in italy for longer than anywhere else , they started coming by boat first , remember ? 
  they never stopped , also . 
   traffickers would be forced to buy new equipment for each trip that 's already their modus operandi, 
  or one who is too protected to end up caught, 
  holy shit , there will be 10 billion people on earth in 35 years ? 
  i 'd like to emigrate to another planet , then !, 
  hospitality is a business , you know ... 
  there 's been a few scandals on that matter in italy . 
  it reminds me a lot of the problems between north and south italy . 
  the point is that if you want unity you have to compromise , otherwise it 's everyone on his own and farewell . 
   one lorry driver hauling forbidden food pulled a u-turn and escaped back to belarus before border officials could destroy his illegal cargo , the service said on thursday . 
  my hero . 
  if you feel that 's it 's so easy to run a business , why did n't you open one ? 
  it does n't matter if people think of their salary as the amount after taxes , the business still needs to pay them , so when you need to hire someone you do n't have a 1200 $ extra cost , but a 2500 $ one . 
  if you ca n't afford it , you do n't hire . 
  and then people complain about unemployment . 
  i 'm not saying that it was reasonable for them to offer you 800 $ , nor i 'm devaluing your work , i 'm simply saying that the game is rigged against everybody . 
  sar\u00e0 che sto in una regione di ubriaconi , ma qui lavorare in un bar \u00e8 un `` dream-job '', 
  and that 's the reason why in italy there are absolutely no restaurants , no agriculture , dairies etc !, 
  i wo n't even waste my time finding a name to call you . 
  there 's lots of submerged economy in the north , too ... 
  the problem is that those are all small jobs, 
  those who offend you are just sheltered , ignorant fools , bear them no mind . 
  hardships give you strength that they 'll never possess , instead they 'll be living like little kids for all their lives . 
  we 're all being let down by our governments, 
  is there room for one more ? 
  ... maybe without a car, 
  well it 's not just that . 
  often it 's also families just sticking together , at some point it 's more the parent/s living with them than the other way around . 
  as a business-owner , they probably did n't offer you 800 $ , but 1600 $ ... 
  it 's just that half of it is taxes . 
  maybe it 's tv or something ... scrooge mcduck is from scotland , for example, 
   our standard `` room temperature '' 68f/20c , so i 'm a bit surprised the hotel was wasting money keeping it cooler than that . 
  usually when i check into a hotel in the summer , it 's set at 74 , and then i set it to 70 . 
  here usually a/c units are set to 24 \u00b0 c/75 \u00b0 f , but i know some people who set it as low as 20 \u00b0 c , which in many cases is pointless : old buildings are so poorly insulated that the poor air conditioning ca n't hope to reach that temperature when it 's 37 \u00b0 c outside . 
   i do n't know , i guess it is also what you are used to . 
  i do see a decent amount of women getting cold indoors a lot , but not really men . 
  i work in a building built in 1927 , which was retrofitted with ac . 
  a decent amount of women wear sweaters and use heaters in the summer . 
  but i do n't think it 's possible to properly cool such an old and huge building . 
  i guess it 's like an high-rise , where you ca n't open windows ? 
   and what were you doing in hartford ?
