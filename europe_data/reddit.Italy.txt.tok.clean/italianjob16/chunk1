duopoly of providers which can not be bothered to front the costs to put down some cables outside the main cities because demand will never be high enough to justify said costs . 
  our property laws , bureacracy and corruption prevent homegrown networks from even being imagined . 
  last time i checked it was 2014 , and the eu was more than capable of defending itself . 
  you 've summed it up perfectly . 
  please leave , i think you 'd be doing us all a favour . 
  the eu was never imagined to be operating in its current limbo state of neither federation ( with proper electoral system ) nor simple trade union and i think the uk has always been the main culprit holding us back for fear of losing their `` sovereignty '' which i find absolutely laughable because meanwhile the rest of western europe has us bases every 100km in each direction . 
  once they come ? 
  ugh ... if the us did n't have bases in all of western countries , i can assure you russia would already be applying to be part of the eu . 
  unfortunately for us , the us has no intention of letting go of its influence on western europe and needs an excuse to keep funding its military industrial complex so russia remains the bogeyman . 
  could please make an attempt at getting informed about what you 're talking about instead of shitposting ? 
  seeing as you 've contributed nothing to the eu-bailout fund for greece , i do n't see how it would affect you . 
  if anything you should be happy our taxes have gone to pay off your bankers ' speculative investments in greece . 
  http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2014/02/15/bitcoin-a-flawed-currency-blueprint-with-a-potentially-useful-application-for-the-eurozone/ ignore the bitcoin buzzwords and read the actual methodology . 
  to follow from your comment , [ in february last year ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2014/02/15/bitcoin-a-flawed-currency-blueprint-with-a-potentially-useful-application-for-the-eurozone/ ) he described the process in detail . 
  i advise everyone to go through it before going apeshit about counterfeit money, 
  cheaper than feeding an american woman, 
  for another [ point of view ] ( http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1027831.shtml )  with the distortions caused to the gdp and gnp ( gross national product ) metrics , by the foreign owned exporting sector - - tax avoidance by just 3 companies google , microsoft and facebook accounted for $ 34bn or 36 % of irish services exports in 2013 - - there are huge opportunities for delusion in ireland and it thrives through boom and bust . 
  more like east london m8, 
  no matter the supposed germanic consipracies we ( europe ) have done [ plenty ] ( http://imgur.com/wlgf8by ) to try and keep greece afloat ... unlike some others ( e.g. 
  it 's a recognized language and not a dialect . 
  well i was actually thinking only about the actual debt amount lost and not a total grexit as it appears to now be heading towards , but you 're right . 
   as it 's expected that euro lose some value . 
  that goes against all economic logic . 
  if you decrease supply of money and demand stays the same price has to go up . 
  furthermore demand will increase when greece gets out because finally the ez will be stable . 
  even if it does go down , a low euro is good for exports , which is why we are still doing qe right now ( i.e. 
  printing money ) . 
  no , we should all live in a offense-free society where nothing is discussed , everything is politically correct , and a massive police state is put in place so that whenever you tweet a joke to your friends the police arrest you . 
  remember when we all went to iraq to find wmds ? 
  good times ... 
  that 's strange , i thought people elected governments which represented their point of view . 
  you 're basically [ saudi arabia 2.0 ] ( https://jaymans.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/eu-muslim-population.jpg ), 
  yes , happy ramadan mohammed , 
  but the islamic republics begin north of the alps, 
  we lost `` our '' independence in 1943 , get over it . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  the number of recognized `` refugees '' are completely different from the masses of * illegal * immigrants with no right to that status who bypass all official control . 
  that 's against several international laws and we 've already been fined for it in the past - even having to pay each of the deported 15000 euro . 
  med union when ? 
  yeah keep hiding the dirt under the rug , it will clean itself up eventually right ? 
  obviously i could n't , maybe you can help ? 
  you have [ the minority ] ( http://imgur.com/teh1vbg ) opinion in your country . 
  and with regards to italians `` not giving a fuck '' , [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17138606 ) is what happened when we tried to send them back . 
  the comparisons with poland is facetious - one is a eu member since 2004 the other was pretty much a russian puppet state until recently . 
  if we wanted to help russia we could sell them the mistrals after all . 
  nouvelle cuisine is gastronomic masturbation . 
  meanwhile , everyone at home is cooking pasta with well established , traditional recipes . 
  nice straw-man argument , that 's not what i implied at all . 
   government funded movies need to get approval from a more or less politically correct council , so they can be blander in one aspect . 
  if by blander you mean less explosions then yes , european films are not trying to compete with michael bay . 
  if by blander you mean more politically correct , you are completely wrong . 
  `` blue is the warmest color '' was funded by france 2 cinema which is a public company and it features graphic lesbian sex scenes - and it also won cannes in 2013 . 
  the issue here is n't providing content , it 's creating a monopoly where only `` american '' movies get funding . 
  we 'd finally get a federal europe ... 
  it was a massive improvement over the previous system which was basically pure proportional representation . 
  we previously had elections on average every 9 months due to internal party squabbles and failures in the cohesion of coalition governments . 
  although no one wants to admit it , the reform did a lot of things to give the country much needed political stability for better or worse . 
  we already had a referendum to abolish the current law ... i 'll let you research how that went on your own . 
  on a side note the 0,4 % for 2,5 times the votes is nothing compared to what goes on in other countries you probably consider more democratic . 
  first-past-the-post comes to mind . 
  you 're right , they 're the third with 12.6 % of the popular vote . 
   i 'm looking at you , italy they passed a new electoral law this week . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32593187 watch the second video , tell me how many of those interviewed qualify for refugee status . 
  last i checked , traveling from ghana to turkey and then trying to get into europe because your football career did n't take off was n't classified as a life threatening situation . 
  well the way i read it you seemed to imply they were inflating the numbers . 
  3000 on saturday , 4000 on sunday = 7000 over the weekend as stated in the article . 
  this is the power of math . 
  i understand your line of reasoning , but if europe has to work ( and i want it to work ) you have to obey the rules and it 's everyone 's duty to try to change them when they do n't work . 
  by that reasoning we should n't have borders at all, 
  if they want to come here to work , they can apply for business visas like the rest of the world . 
  since you want to go down the economics route , increasing worker supply decreases wages - that 's a fact . 
  if companies had this dire need of workers we would n't have double digit unemployment rates in some of the biggest eu economies and we 'd be actively seeking them out . 
  the proof comes in that they 're not migrating to neighboring peaceful countries but opting to come to europe instead . 
  oh give me a break . 
  you think their families gather the equivalent of a year or more of salary and risk their children 's lives to get nothing in return ? 
  do you have any idea how living in developing countries is at all ? 
  birth rates are high in developing countries because children are needed to sustain the family . 
  if you need more sources for this i suggest enrolling in high school and taking a class that covers basic human geography . 
   source this , please . 
  i never thought someone from india of all places would actually ask this . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/remittance  immigrants from africa today number approximately 20 to 30 million adults , who send around $ 40 billion usd annually to their families and local communities back home . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22169474  in 2010 - the most recent year for which meaningful comparisons can be made , according to mr bodomo - the african diaspora remitted $ 51.8 bn ( # 34bn ) to the continent . 
  [ seems like it ] ( http://imgur.com/teh1vbg ), 
  we got fined from brussels for doing that a few years ago ( after sweden complained ) . 
  all i can say is good luck everyone else - i can assure you none of them want to stay in italy . 
  edit : we also had to give each of the deported [ 15000euro in damages ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17138606 ) so you can bet your ass we wo n't be trying that again . 
   majority of german indeed thinks we should defend ourself if we are under attack and the rest ? 
   if the uk does n't accept free movement everyone loses too . 
  uk is a services export economy , once free trade ends all the service providers will move elsewhere , it 's not like they have a natural monopoly on some special natural resource . 
  the only reason banks congregated there in the first place was because they paid less tax . 
  i would be proud of that . 
  it does n't really matter , if i owned a business i would n't wait around to see what happens in two years . 
  to put it mildly , wait all you want you 're still fucked . 
  businesses wo n't be waiting around for the uk to make the decision , i wish them luck . 
  12 % of the time on the losing side in the european council . 
  the next country in the list is germany with half that percentage . 
  [ link ] ( http://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/does-the-uk-win-or-lose-in-the-council-of-ministers/ ) not to mention the whole gchq basically being the us ear on europe . 
  more ethnic cleansing to do ? 
  ah you 're right , i got thrown off with italy since we 've always been majority pro-eu france , germany and italy count for about 60 % of the total eu gdp ( excluding the uk already ) http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i= ( france + gdp + % 2b + germany + gdp + % 2b + italy + gdp ) + % 2f + ( eu + gdp + - + uk+gdp ), 
  you do n't get a 15 year mandate if people do n't like you,
