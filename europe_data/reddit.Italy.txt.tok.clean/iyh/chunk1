but europeans should blame themselves for making them what they are absolutely one of the stupidest things i 've ever read on / r/europe . 
  the everyday european is to blame because arabs in possession of a european passport decide to conduct a holy war outside of our borders ? 
  do you even believe the drivel you type ? 
  i quote wolfgang m\u00fcnchau in a [ recent financial times article ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7b80fc52-94cc-11e3-af71-00144feab7de.html ) : `` first , eurozone inflation must be prevented from persistently undershooting the inflation target , as it has been recently . 
  second , italy needs lower market interest rates , which would require further unconventional policy measures . 
  third , shaky banks must be restructured and crumbling ones closed , and a `` bad bank '' set up to hold the debris . 
  fourth , massive current surpluses in germany and the netherlands will have to fall . 
  these surpluses are making it extremely difficult and painful for the eurozone periphery to adjust . 
  mr renzi should channel his rebellious spirit and make this case to his northern neighbours . '', 
  besides these italy 's electoral law is unconstitutional and renzi will almost certainly look to get a new one passed but given the fragile nature of the new coalition government , it does n't look very likely . 
  implying the ukrainians who have died during protests did so for some foreign government that does n't give a shit about them is frankly insulting and minimizes their sacrifice . 
  it would take a particularly malevolent breed of propagandist to attribute civilian deaths just outside our borders to a rallying cry for pro-eu politics . 
  disgusting article . 
  your political views are dangerous and radical . 
   but hey , if someone identifies as a liberal and yet fights alongside them is an idiot and might as well get shot you would wish death upon people who share views with you solely because they protested with those on the opposite side of the spectrum ? 
  monster . 
  \u252c \u2500 \u252c \u30ce ( - \u30ce ) tranquillo, 
  the alps , of course !, 
  particularly the western alps of my province ( alpi cozie , alpi graie ) . 
  sure , i 'll probably just use the redd.it url shortener . 
  sometimes i forget it 's even there . 
  you expressed disagreement with their labelling as `` brownshirt tactics '' and from there you insisted they had no reasonable expectation of privacy . 
  you did not explicitly agree with the actions but your continued defense of them here suggests you 'd be a lot less sympathetic if white nationalist groups leaked personal data of antifa members who commented online under the presumption that they were anonymous , not to mention your attempt to delegitimize certain political positions as not qualifying as political speech [ here ] ( http://it.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1sxedd/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week/ce26lqj ) . 
  the sturmabteilung were effective at intimidating anti-nazi legislators and voters via street violence . 
  by discouraging voters and politicians from standing against the nazi party , the sturmabteilung had essentially derailed the democratic process . 
  if you ca n't see the analogy with the blatant attempts at intimidation here , then i simply do n't know what to say in response . 
  it 's a refusal to acknowledge guilt . 
  i have n't followed the expressen controversy too closely but i remember reading about it here . 
  you must not underestimate the significance of being `` dox 'd '' online and there 's a reason why it 's against the rules here , among many other sites . 
  there is a very real threat of violence for certain types of online activity and the story you 're commenting on is proof of that . 
  the research group is to condemn for their nsa-like digging through of metadata and linking of disqus accounts to e-mail addresses to sell a good story to expressen , who is also to condemn for publishing a hitlist of people whose political views do n't fit the mainstream narrative . 
  would there have been a bomber today without the two aforementioned parties ? 
  this would almost certainly be a consequence of the revelations of expressen . 
  and to think that [ there were actually people on / r/europe ] ( http://it.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1sxedd/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week/ce269t4 ) who agreed with those actions simply because those targeted had opposing political views . 
  us too , `` ciao ciao '' is a common way to salute friends goodbye . 
  i love how the only `` italian '' to offer was a german on vacation here . 
  the euro skeptics who took it are now having a field day with the metaphor . 
  this is a really cool site and i shared it with my roommates . 
  my highest match is the dutch mep bas belder , which is odd since i do n't identify with the christian right at all . 
  can any dutch people tell me about good ol' signor belder ? 
  party-wise it 's the austrian fp\u00d6 and french fn with 67 % each . 
  i think it would be funny if we wrote what our lowest match is too . 
  i got some latvian party vienot\u012bba . 
  the lack of political correctness and americanization , especially compared to other european countries . 
  it 's impossible to dismiss my personal bias since something like an anthem is designed to invoke nationalist sentiment . 
  one need only watch [ buffon emotionally belt out the story of italian unification , eyes closed , ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umxdc7ccnm0 ) to appreciate our anthem . 
  also , on a purely aesthetic level ... it has a fun rhythm . 
  some confusion here and lots of confusion over in / r/worldnews about who she is , what her position is , how she was elected , and why any of this matters . 
  i do n't have time to write out an / r/bestof quality post here but i 'll summarize . 
  most people i 've spoken to in italy realize she was a token appointee . 
  / u/mick _ jones in / r/italy compared her appointment to how lots of women were given secondary positions in the 90s in accordance with equal opportunity . 
  c\u00e9cile kyenge has done well for herself ; she 's an educated woman who came here on a scholarship to study medicine and ended up becoming an ophthalmologist . 
  a model immigrant . 
  she was granted the opportunity to succeed and worked as a domestic worker upon arrival here to support herself . 
  she works in italy , pays taxes in italy , married an italian , and became an italian citizen . 
  not even the most far-right member of the lega nord would have any problem with what i said so far . 
  ms. kyenge eventually decided to get involved in the `` manicomio '' of italian politics . 
  anyone in any democratic country who enters the political realm opens themselves up to criticism , some more legitimate than others . 
  italy is a democratic country but as far as i know , the only country to share our exact political system is greece . 
  enough said , right ? 
  from the start , kyenge was elected to a minor role in her adoptive city of modena as `` the provinical head of international cooperation and immigration '' . 
  from there she became involved with italy 's main center-left party , the pd , in the region in which she lives , emilia-romagna ( historically known as a `` red region '' for being left-wing/communist/anti-fascist ) . 
  the pd got the most votes this year and when a coalition was finally formed , the new prime minister enrico letta selected his cabinet with c\u00e9cile kyenge as the minister of integration . 
  what is the minister of integration ? 
  what power does he/she have ? 
  other italians can correct me if i 'm wrong , but i 'm fairly sure it was a new ministerial role created under the past monti government . 
  kyenge is only the second ever minister of integration . 
  this role is known as a `` ministero senza portafoglio '' meaning she has no actual legislative power herself and mainly serves to advise those who do actually make the laws . 
  i 've heard them colloquially called `` ministri a met\u00e0 '' or `` half-ministers '' . 
  [ here 's the list ] ( http://www.governo.it/governo/ministeri/ministri_gov.html ) from the italian government 's website of the ministers and their respective areas . 
  you begin to see where the conflict arises . 
  heavily left-leaning region elects congo-born woman for immigration positions and she now rises to the national level of politics . 
  she has n't hidden what she wants to accomplish in her new position ; she wishes to pass laws that would grant citizenship to any child born in italy and in general make it easier to obtain italian citizenship . 
  politicians on the right are rightfully worried because this would basically be a generation of voters that predominantly vote left . 
  ordinary italians are getting caught in the political crossfire and accused of racism by people halfway across the world who never left their state . 
  my opinion on the matter is that illegitimate criticism , such as throwing bananas and saying she looks like an orangutan , is ** wrong ** and politically short-sighted . 
  by giving ammunition to foreign press , kyenge 's profile is raised and she is handling this remarkably well . 
  a politician making an argument about why new citizenship laws wo n't help italy emerge from its economic crisis and will irreversibly change its demographics wo n't get reported abroad , but a random guy throwing a banana will and has made us all look like idiots . 
  you 're basically saying you 're in favor of dissolving member nations ' government agencies to replace them with one operated by an undemocratic government hundreds of kilometers away from our borders . 
  if they were indeed ** replaced ** by an eu agency , we would be even more in the shitter . 
  i 'd love to ask some swedes and englishmen if they 'd be more comfortable with italians and portuguese spying on them instead of their own countrymen . 
  and considering the colossal budget of this proposal , i highly doubt there would be `` a lot less surveillance '' than there is today . 
  in the usa , the dialogue is gradually shifting . 
  i do believe the nsa spying program will be weakened or eliminated rather soon . 
  the bill to defund it failed by the narrowest of margins . 
  meanwhile in europe , we 're actually discussing setting up another intelligency agency * in response * to the edward snowden scandal . 
  this is the polar opposite of what should have happened . 
  it reminds me of republican rhetoric in america in response to gun crime ( more guns make us safer etc ) . 
  conclusion : this is a stupid , dangerous proposal and the eu should not be operating drones , be they spy drones or the predator variety that the us uses in places like yemen and waziristan . 
  i argued that european citizens would be quick to condemn domestic spying here , be it conducted by our own governments or the american government , but when the eu does it we get the the standard drum-beaters who love increased european integration , no matter the cost . 
  if you 're so naive as to think spy drones would be used solely abroad to `` keep us safe '' , i believe you have been living under a rock for the past two months . 
  i ca n't make this any clearer . 
   senior european officials regard the plan as an urgent response to the recent scandal over american and british communications surveillance by creating eu 's own security and spying agency . 
  not right when those anglos do it , but right for us ? 
  ** europeans when the us uses drones ** : fuck amerikkka how dare they circumvent international law and execute their own citizens without due process !, 
  what an utterly barbaric nation !, 
  try obama and bush for war crimes !, 
  snowden for peace prize !, 
  ** europeans when the eu uses drones ** : oh spy drones are a great idea . 
  they would help solidify the notion of european national identity and cut down on defense costs of each constituent nation .
