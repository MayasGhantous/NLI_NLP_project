  if the uk were offered the option to stay in the single market without accepting fom or paying into the eu budget you honestly believe that they would n't take it ? 
  that sounds like the brexiteer 's wet dream . 
  is your definition of making it as costly and painful as possible not letting the eu access to the single market without paying the costs ? 
  the eu will give the uk access to the single market in some sort of eea deal if the uk accepts fom . 
  if not , then they negotiate a free trade deal . 
  how is that punishing and painful ? 
  if i stop paying for netflix next month is netflix punishing me by not letting me continue to watch their movies for free ? 
  i do n't make a habit of responding to trolls as facts do n't affect your kind , but here goes . 
   there is nothing it can do to prevent the english from getting everything they want . 
  what exactly does this mean ? 
  what is everything they want ? 
  the eu can prevent them from access to the single market for goods and services . 
  outside of that , the eu does n't really care if the uk wants to sign trade deals with other countries . 
   so weak it cant negotiate anything because it is not beneficial to be part of it . 
  a bloc of nations comprising a population of 500 million and the largest combined economy in the world is weak ? 
  the eu does n't need a negotiating stance , it 's not trying to keep the uk , the uk is the one asking for things , the eu would be much less worse off than the uk to just walk away from negotiations , let the treaties cease to apply to the uk after two years and trade via wto rules . 
   it is imperative for a country to have control over it 's own borders . 
  otherwise the net negatives of migration far outweigh the net positives . 
  literally every statistic regarding eu immigration to the uk tells it the other way around . 
  immigration has been a massive net positive for the uk economy . 
   the only countries clinging to the eu are germany and the eastern european states . 
  what about ireland ? 
  they are one of the most vocal supporters of the eu . 
   the project has failed on such an epic scale exactly which part has failed ? 
  has every single eu policy worked out positively ? 
  no , of course not . 
  is the eu perfect ? 
  no , of course not . 
  but nobody but you thinks it has failed on an epic scale . 
   a nation that leaves the eu dictates all terms . 
  what terms ? 
  this is just factually untrue , the uk ca n't dictate any trade terms to the eu , the uk is the one in a weak negotiating position . 
   the only thing that holds this nation back from asking for too much , is the promise of may to not crash the union . 
  how would may theoretically crash the union ? 
   the eu isnt even able to punish england for their behavior . 
  it has to let go and on english terms . 
  the eu does n't want to punish england . 
  it wants to let the english go on english terms . 
  that 's why article 50 exists . 
   the english people are true visionaries , blessed with a foresight none of the remain campaigners have . 
  may is also a cold and superior tactician , she is forcing a hard brexit because she knows the eu is weak and cant do anything about it . 
  article 50 exists because the eu is n't an insoluble union . 
  it 's designed so a state can leave if they want . 
   and this is only brexit . 
  trump hasnt even started yet and he is going to hit the eu economy bigly with tariffs . 
  and what 's he going to do with the uk ? 
   the eu is a toothless tiger . 
  it 's actually the largest single market in the world . 
   you seem to lack the most basic economic and politicial understanding . 
  england is the one in the strong position here . 
  they are leaving a sinking ship , ready to start trade with the emerging markets on a scale not possible while being in the eu . 
  every deal the english will cut with the asia , north america , south america , oceania , australia and the eu will be custom tailored to the interest of the british people . 
  the eu is in a much better position than the uk to cut deals with emerging markets . 
  if you 're a country like china , would you spend more time and effort trying to cut a deal with a market of 500 million consumers or one of 60 million ? 
  the uk is losing its biggest trading partner . 
  that 's not a good thing . 
   they will also be able to lower their taxes significantly , attracting many businesses from the eu . 
  this is impossible . 
  the only nations that survive as tax havens are extremely small ones because they can base their entire political and economic structure on being a tax haven . 
  the uk ca n't do that , it 's too big . 
  uk public services are already stressed , cutting tax revenues would be suicide . 
  and even if it did attract businesses , those same businesses would want access to the eu anyway , and the uk would n't see that hypothetical potential economic growth for years . 
   the threat of doing so is enough for merkel to cave in . 
  she has already given up on the idea of free movement . 
  source ? 
  probably not because this is not true . 
   the eu cant allow the 6th largest economy in the world to be barred from trading with its businesses because some brussels bureaucrat is butthurt . 
  the eu does n't want to do this . 
  they want to trade with the uk . 
  but the uk ca n't allow the largest economy in the world and its largest trading partner to be barred from trading with its businesses because some bureaucrat in london is butthurt . 
  it works both ways buddy . 
  the difference is that the impact of losing uk trade on the eu is fractional compared to the impact on the uk of losing trade with the eu . 
  i ca n't tell if you 're just trolling or legitimately believe these falsehoods that you 're spouting , but i hope it 's the former . 
  if you legitimately believe this stuff then you should stop getting your news from the kremlin . 
  there is a reason why every person who studies economics and political science in the uk said brexit was a bad idea . 
  because it is . 
  it is economically and politically stupid , and it will hurt your country for years . 
  the brexiteers response to this was `` we 're tired of listening to experts . '', 
  brexit was entirely based on either straight up lies , or anti-intellectualism . 
  you ca n't use facts to back up brexit because there are none . 
  brexit was the voters of the uk deciding that their feelings about immigration , globalization , and inequality mattered more than the facts and so they chose to inflict economic harm on themselves in order to `` restore sovereignty . '', 
  that 's the reality of the situation . 
  no matter how great you think the british people are and how evil the eu is , the facts support the idea that the uk will be worse off economically and geopolitically after brexit . 
  ** when the juncker or hollande say something about the uk : ** oh my god they 're being babies , they 're treating us so badly , they 're appalling . 
  ** when boris johnson says something : ** stop being so whiny and get over it . 
  how silly to think that bankers might follow the money ? 
  london must just be so superior to every other city on the european continent that it would be inconceivable that bankers would move someplace else for more money . 
   that clause is un-necessary and punitive . 
  this is a completely subjective opinion . 
  i just gave you reasons why this clause is there . 
  the uk agreed to the clause when they signed the treaty . 
  the other 27 countries agreed to it as well . 
  i do n't think that 28 heads of state got together and just threw a bunch of words together and signed it and said oh this is unnecessary but who cares , we 'll do it anyway . 
  the point of the clause is that the union loses all of its bargaining power if individual states can bargain themselves . 
  in reality this might be moot anyway because the uk ( or at least pre-brexit uk 9 months ago ) does n't / did n't have negotiators seeing as how they have n't had to negotiate trade deals since the 70s . 
  if you want to dig up the civil servants that you have and send them to new zealand to negotiate a trade deal with a country of 4.5 million to replace a market ten times that size , be my guest . 
  it probably does n't really matter that much anyway , but unfortunately i 'm not the one who made the rules . 
   the eu changes rules all the time when it suits them . 
  just look at what they did to greece and ireland . 
  they can change that rule as well .
