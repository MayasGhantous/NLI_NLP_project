  germans do have the habit of pronouncing it * schemie * with ** sh ** , though . 
  which , to me , is far worse than ** k ** . 
  [ yeah ... 
  right . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_peipus ), 
  that huge lake you got there is pretty sweet , though . 
  i was just looking on the site of the corriere what exactly this is about , but did n't find anything , so i guess it is not really a thing , is it . 
  on the other hand , italy will do everything she can just to get her hands on some more money . 
  if someone asked me for directions , most probably i could n't even answer them in my native language . 
  giving directions is really hard . 
  as chancellor merkel would put it and should put it - thing is she does n't even care , the digital single market in the eu is alternativlos . 
  there is no alternative and the question here is not if but when it will come . 
  so the lobbies trying to slow down this are fighting the inevitable . 
   you mean marry them into austria . 
  ftfy, 
  renzi is finally getting things done . 
  or is he ? 
  well then we only had tent camps of libyan dictators in our parks . 
  that 's not so bad , is it . 
  / r/tmerkelfu needs to happen asap . 
  unfortunate hashtag . 
  #vexodus would be prettier . 
  #vexit would also be fine . 
  you know what they say , if you could dig holes using hate , the elbe would be 200m deep . 
  start charging tolls on all motorways 2 . 
  lower car taxes so that no one complains 3 . 
  privatise motorways 4 . 
   shoving a minority government down the majority 's throat italian election laws suck . 
  majority bonuses are not a way of fixing the political system . 
  so ... you 're saying ... if germany has n't won , it 's not the end ? 
  i do n't necessarily agree with the author . 
  of course historians will draw lines between different events , but they can only do it in retrospective . 
  and as they say , hindsight is 20/20 . 
  but you ca n't draw the lines while you 're in the middle of the situation . 
  there 's prognoses for many different outcomes and possible futures , so one of them will always end up right and * no one listened to them at the time * . 
  the thing is , we just do n't know right now . 
  you ca n't draw the lines before the things are over . 
  edit : shit , i just saw when the article was written . 
  that 's a first step for the prophecy to come true . 
  thanks for the source . 
  i had just looked it up on wikipedia quickly and a dubious list came up with italy ahead of the uk , which is crazy . 
  not needed , there 's two counter examples in the 20th century alone . 
   publicly humiliate trump as he deserves but he is the elected president and as such deserves respect . 
  what is the world coming to if we do n't respect the democratically elected president of a country anymore ? 
  why * former * ? 
  dream big !, 
  i 'm just going to leaves this here ... [ ~ ~ meno male che donald c ' \u00e8 ~ ~ thank goodness for donald ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utvr0zkdfys ), 
   italy better get it over with quickly , because in 3 weeks italy is going to be submerged in political turmoil . 
  which can take a while . 
  but if we take as a given that he is a crazy person , does it even matter if we have the nuclear deterrent or not ? 
  would a crazy person care about that ? 
  italy needs to command it . 
  they always end up on the winning side in the end . 
   the us and uk [ ... ] the two most powerful militaries [ citation needed ] ... 
  but seriously , who measures this and how ? 
   von der leyen last time i checked , she was still in shock because of trump . 
  poor thing . 
  do n't let the filter bubble fool you . 
  the fact that the mother chicken is called * notre m\u00e8re l'europe * disqualifies this as being something from a long gone past . 
  oh ... and the nazi chick . 
  no matter what happens , germany always wins . 
   germany [ ... ] liberal beacon of reason always has been , always will be . 
   in december i already see the optimism coming through !, 
  stay strong !, 
  it 's just a feeling i have . 
  the last election came as quite a surprise to many people , so i would n't bet on anything though . 
  i just have a feeling that the vdb campaign has not much to gain among non-voters , so they wo n't improve their result . 
  i would be surprised if hofer did n't win , to be honest . 
  well this does n't have much to do with trump . 
  they probably wrote that thing one month in advance and just needed to know whom to address it to . 
  but we know two things : china just wants the money . 
  on the other hand , wars are burning the money . 
  therefore , china does not want the wars . 
  ^ ( right ? ), 
  as chairman mao said : without destruction , there can be no construction . 
  i do n't see a war coming , but i do see some political destruction ahead . 
  and overpopulation . 
  my parents tell me they heard a lot about that problem in school . 
   heck , the closer the eu and russia would get , the closer we would be to rivaling the us in soft and maybe eventually even hard power after a while . 
  but the continent would be overpowered by russia ( as the biggest single country in this scenario ) and germany ( as the strongest economy ) . 
  now russia and germany leading europe , that 's not how i envision my eu . 
   i would love for america and russia to be friends again were they ever friends ? 
  i do n't see them being friends working out well for the world . 
  it is astonishing how deeply in denial the whole european media ** and ** european politics were to trump 's chances of winning . 
  it seems like everyone was out of touch with reality . 
  no wonder most western countries start being internally divided if everyone just reads and acknowledges what they want to . 
  it serves the european politicians right that they get a bad start with trump . 
  as for me personally , i hope it will work out well for europe in the sense that we finally get an independent foreign policy and more unity and cohesion . 
  i hope this is the starting point for a multipolar world where europe is not in need of a legal guardian usa anymore . 
  usa , eu , china as the three major powers in this multipolar system should be where it 's at , with russia unsure of whom to follow . 
  alas , this will probably not come true , but one can dream , right ? 
  you know , when your parents start becoming crazy oompa loompas , you need to move the fuck out of your home and start a life on your own . 
  time for europe to grow up !, 
  do you think trump winning has increased the chances of austria having a president hofer in the near future ( or distant future , depending on how many times you intend to vote again ) ? 
  no matter what happens in the world , germany always wins . 
  ^ ( except for wars . ), 
  greece rejecting the bailout ? 
  germany won . 
  germany gains ( relative ) weight in the eu . 
  we need to unify the eu * more * .
