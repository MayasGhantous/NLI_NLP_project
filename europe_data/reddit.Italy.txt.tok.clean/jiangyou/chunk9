   o7o7o7o7o7o7 now i know how that woman serenaded winnie the poo . 
  i 'm surprised it worked , though . 
  i personally would 've added the amazingly cruel [ beijing welcomes you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6gsbi35sh4 ) to that list . 
  china can not into soft power . 
  that 's a hilf if i 've ever seen one !, 
  this needs a trigger warning . 
  i know i 'm triggered !, 
  can someone fix this please . 
  this looks beautiful . 
  but i do feel guilty for finding something so terrible beautiful to look at . 
  also , your clock tower is prettier than ours . 
  it started with an innocent austrian guy just wanting to reap the sweet karma using a picturesque scenery found a few kilometres south the border . 
  fair enough . 
  then the shitshow starts . 
  seriously , one might think that after decades of peaceful coexistence in this land ( and the people who endured the hardships of the fascist period dying out ) , people would be less irritated by any opinions and discussions of this topic . 
  but no . 
  kinda sad , is n't it . 
  and do n't forget that vladivostok is rightful chinese clay !, 
  [ haishenwai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladivostok#history ) , as the chinese call it , was taken from qing china by russia in an unequal treaty the prc was never able to reverse because things with the soviet union were complicated . 
   a gda\u0144sk gdog now say that ten times fast . 
   danish pigs get sent to butchers in germany , and then are sold in asia so all that stays in denmark is some money and a whole lot of pig shit ? 
  i 'm not sure about polls , but it 's safe to say the ( silent ) majority probably prefers the status quo over any border-shifting or instability due to political tensions . 
  therefore , no politician in charge wants to open that can of worms . 
  one important thing to know is that before ww1 , the habsburg monarchy was bound together mainly by the person of the emperor himself along with his dynasty . 
  the emperor liked to address his countrymen by `` my peoples '' , as they were not one people with one language , but many peoples with different languages . 
  the emperor held all of this together , which was good and bad . 
  bad mainly because after the monarchy tanked , most of those peoples wanted independence . 
  after ww1 , the austrian empire broke apart and austria lost a lot of territories , among them south tyrol , which did n't leave by choice but was taken as spoils of war . 
  now the austrian nation-building only set in after ww1 ( and ww2 ) , so in general south tyroleans will not feel austrian in any way . 
  with the difficult situation under fascist italy and the tensions after ww2 , it is also difficult for the german speaking population to feel italian . 
  so what 's left is a faint european feeling and a rather strong sense of being south tyrolean . 
  you 're trolling hard , i see, 
  in english it would be south tyrol , just so you know . 
  and the reasoning behind my weird spelling is , if the conversation starts with * stelvio pass * , to me it 's only natural to keep using italian names . 
  so , do you go to bulgaria often to fill up your tank ? 
  did you want to top this statistic with  80 $ ? 
  for real , though , how much would it be in norway ? 
  thank you for the data . 
  i love data !, 
   but damn , now i do n't know if that 's a high or a low survival rate for marriages ... also , `` homohuwelijk '' is one hell of a word . 
  and for the sake of completeness : this puts the probability of both of them being still married at 58.8 % . 
  that 's not too bad !, 
  it was a joke , you know . 
  also , we would just need a divorce rate of ~ 30 % after 16 years , and the probability of both of the couples being still married would be a mere 49 % , so it would be less probable than at least one divorce having taken place . 
  the divorce : marriage ratio in the netherlands is 43 % according to wikipedia , so * of course * we are not there with the numbers , but again : it was a joke . 
   summer skiing til you can still do summer skiing in alto adige . 
  i thought they discontinued that everywhere because of a lack of tourists . 
  so ~ ~ italy-austria ~ ~ greece-bulgaria is the most ridiculous difference when crossing a border ? 
  i 'm too lazy to take all the differences . 
  i like the special 2 $ coins , like the ones with dante or galileo , or the german federal states ... 
  most other regular coins are not interesting enough anymore . 
  so they divorced , yet ? 
  statistically , chances are at least one of the couples is already divorced . 
  this was a sturzgeburt if i 've ever seen one . 
  i find it interesting that there is so much significance in the usage or absence of this one character \u570b . 
  also , regarding  \u7f8e\u570b\uacfc \u7c73\u570b the japanese spelling using rice just grinds my gears . 
  i never thought about that . 
  that is hilarious !, 
  what can you say , sheep are beautiful . 
   it will make their coalition negotiations easier though , since every potential partner has insisted on gay marriage being passed and i thought it diminishes their bargaining power , because they have one thing less that they can just give their opponents in exchange for something they want . 
   america is mei guo - beautiful country . 
  and merino sheep are called `` beautiful profit slave sheep '' . 
   \u524d\u5357\u65af\u62c9\u592b\u9a6c\u5176\u987f\u5171\u548c\u56fd qian nansilafu maqidun gongheguo ... close enough ? 
  such a handy name , though . 
   the name of the eight nations , except japan , was rewritten to include `` guo '' or states . 
  i guess japan preferred the traditional name `` sun rise '' . 
  austra-hungary and italy do not have much interactions with china subsequently and the `` guo '' was gradually dropped . 
  do you have any source on this one ? 
  i mean , i understand that there is not many countries that have \u56fd in their shortened name , but i ca n't seem to find any confirmation on the reason for this . 
  if i could have a guess everything just stems from the chinese tendency to abbreviate everything . 
  so \u6cd5\u5170\u897f is just too many syllables , let 's shorten it !, 
  and with china being a huge territory with not much contact to the outside world until very recently , there was no need for a lot of country names of smaller countries . 
  it 's hard to abbreviate names that are not really in frequent use . 
  still , i 'm not sure why they reverted to \u4fc4\u7f57\u65af from the shorter \u4fc4\u56fd . 
  edit : [ so i found a thread on zhihu which supports your theory and explains everything ] ( https://www.zhihu.com/question/21269367 ) , but that 's not really a reliable source , is it . 
  is it weird ? 
  i mean , \u65e5\u672c gets \u65e5\u6587 and \u4e4c\u514b\u5170 ukraine might get \u4e4c\u8bed ( not to be confused with \u4e4c\u5b5c\u522b\u514b\u8bed -  \u4e4c\u8bed uzbek ) . 
  in general , chinese loves to abbreviate everything until you ca n't recognise it anymore . 
  so i do n't find it that weird . 
  i 'm not sure if this is schulz gaining points on a `` weakness '' that merkel suddenly showed , or if it 's merkel stealing away the issues that are dear to her competitors . 
  in any case , i am on the edge of my seat to see how this will play out . 
  merkel will just have to play along and get the thing through parliament . 
  she 's arguably the one that has more to gain than to lose here . 
  fun fact , there is actually a [ japanese character for that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taito_ ( kanji \\ ) ) . 
  it 's a mess , though . 
  but it does in fact literally mean `` the appearance of a dragon in flight '' whatever that may be . 
  germany would be beautiful without the germans . 
  which is a sentence that works in many forms : vienna would be beautiful without the viennese . 
  paris would ... 
  who knows !, 
  we will have to wait for mrs may announcing another tautology . 
  hung means hung . 
  not enough seats is not enough . 
  no coalition is better than a bad coalition . 
  my hard brexit just went soft, 
  she is of the lizard people . 
  also , it 's june already . 
  it looks so mitteleuropean , 
  even if you agree with her point . 
  even if she is right .
