  maybe it is the reason why so many british come to live here ( we are close to the famous `` chiantishire '' between siena and florence ) . 
  14 c and a wet sunday here in tuscany . 
  i 'd like to be conquered by austrians but look , only if you replace our politicians with yours / s, 
  also : felice = happy benvenuta/o = welcome viva = alive immacolata = spotless italia/italo = italy perla = pearl orso = bear generoso = generous desiderata = desired fortunato = lucky domenico/a = sunday arcangelo = archangel angelo = angel ferruccio = little iron gustavo = i tasted vittorio = victory fiore = flower delfina = dolphine guerriero = warrior, 
  bianca = white ( feminine ) gaia = gay ( feminine ) donato/a = gifted pasquale/natale = from easter/christmas selvaggia = wild ( feminine ) libero = free man, 
  really interesting , this thing make me feel so old :d, 
  i beg you , do n't blame me for my ignorance on this matter , but how it works ? 
  because when i was 16 i used to play with an amiga 500 so the only people i could talk to were the friends i invited at my home . 
  it seems to be a good advice . 
  currently i 'm struggling with my english skills because i have to do the cae cambridge in june to get my second degree . 
  so , i 'm really depressed and i 'm trying to read and listen to english as much as i can . 
  moreover , it 's really tough for me given my age and the fact that i 've never been in a english speaking country before . 
  18 \u00b0 c during winter and 27 \u00b0 during summer time ... 
  i hate summer . 
  in italian the country is `` germania '' but people and language are called `` tedeschi/tedesco '' ( from the word theodiscus i suppose ) . 
  same thing for me . 
  i really love being part of this great place and its history . 
  my uncle fought as a sailor ( radioman and soldier ) for the italian royal navy . 
  he fought in libya ( especially tobruk ) and egypt against the uk royal navy for at least two years . 
  after the battle of el-alamein he was taken prisoner but escaped and finally returned in italy . 
  after 1943 he was engaged by the u.s. as an agent and was parachuted many times in piedmont to train and support italian partisans , he fought against nazis some battles into the woods and finally he obtained ( after the war ) a grant by the u.s. army and some medals . 
  edit : he wrote also a diary recently used to publish a book , furthermore he died 10 years ago so i knew him well . 
  ... and tuscany ( even if we were n't part of the empire our grand duchies were part of the habsburg-lorraine house ) . 
  i agree but think about my generation , our english skills are developed because of internet . 
  when we were young the best we could do was listening to some international music if we wanted to learn english language . 
  so , my generation can have an excuse that younger generations do n't have . 
  you 're lucky , if i want my degree i 've to pass c1 level ( not simplified ... ) . 
  actually `` gene '' would be pronounced like / \u02a4\u025bne / in italian , 
  in italian in pronounced as it is written : [ meme ], 
  i have a large bathroom so my washing machine is there . 
  my opinion is we could retain both european and `` national '' identity and as an italian this is n't weird because italy should have been a federation instead of trying to follow the centralist french model . 
  here `` regional '' identities are still strong after 150 years of national unity because our `` regions '' in some cases have inherited culture and language from the ancient pre-roman and roman regions and people . 
  er ... here in tuscany we 'd absolutely win the coarse-words championship , furthermore we drink a lot of wine and yes ... we invented italian language :d, 
  yeah , these are obviously different terms with different meanings . 
  i suppose a better term instead of nationalism would be patriotism . 
  because patriotism seems to be more positive than nationalism ( generally used non only to describe love for a nation but sometimes also for blaming or underrating other nations ), 
  i do n't want to do it but actually here in italy it is the way as many people intend fascism . 
  so we 're talking about a sort of similar food culture related to climate , temperature and weather . 
  but , for example , here in italy we do n't have such homogeneity neither on climate nor on food or culture . 
  tuscany has ( i use it for this example because i live there ) , different climate between our isles , the coastline and the appennines . 
  so we have in tuscany a different food culture but also different buildings not only in relation with our own region but also if you look at italian southern regions . 
  this is what i see obviously ... 
  stay . 
  why should i leave the eu ? 
  we 're talking about the most developed and beautiful land on earth . 
  absolutely not . 
  here in italy nationalists = fascists . 
  what is this `` mediterranean culture '' ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  is it probably because own country deserve it ? 
  we invented that word , so ... 
  italy is far from being considered a culturally united country because of its relatively young story . 
  so i suppose southern regions are closer to greece and spain , rome is rome , north have multiple relation , for example north-east is closer to austria and slovenia while north-west is closer to france and switzerland . 
  my region ( tuscany ) for its story is close to france , austria , uk and spain . 
  certamente ne abbiamo sentito parlare , i messicani mettono il fuoco sia nel cibo che nel letto :d we have heard about mexicans for sure , they put fire both into food and bed . 
  yeah ... i approve it . 
  in my city the centre is [ piazza del campo ] ( http://www.palazzoravizza.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/siena-piazza-del-campo.jpg ), 
  once i ate `` pecora bollita '' ( boiled sheep ) in sardinia ... omg it was ridiculously disgusting . 
  moka coffee with a drop of milk and no sugar for breakfast . 
  espresso with a drop of milk and no sugar at 10:00 for the second breakfast . 
  espresso after lunch . 
  moka cofee with a drop of milk and no sugar at 17:00 tea or tisane without sugar after dinner . 
  in italy we say `` polpette '' , not `` meatballs '' xd, 
  probably it is an `` authentic '' italian-american recipe ... 
  so , definitely not an italian recipe . 
  well , we called the whole mediterranean sea `` mare nostrum '' :d only to piss off every country with a border on it . 
  i 'd love a strong alliance and federation with ireland . 
  we want tuscany as the capital of that empire then you will be forced to learn some actual italian like the old good times :d, 
  here there are some photos of our landscapes in tuscany : http://www.tuscanypictures.com/tuscany-landscapes, 
  ba in communication but currently i have at least 12 years of experience in the sector . 
  i agree . 
  probably irregularities could be considered as a sort of oddment of other language 's influence . 
  it would be really easy if english had all the plurals with `` s '' , only a way to express the future or simple and regular ways to express past participles or infinitive . 
  same thing for italian , we could use only the final `` a '' or `` o '' for singular masculine or feminine names and `` e '' or `` i '' for plural ones . 
  same thing for pronouns or for articles ... it 's a kind of mess because of the evolution of our language . 
  italian is considered by linguistics as a not so standardized language because of its relatively recent adoption and standardization . 
  hahaha yeah , we have a lot of those indeed , so i have to admit it , every language at a high level can be really challenging . 
  7:00 first alarm clock 7:15 second alarm clock , i have to wake up then a i go to bathroom and a prepare some coffee with my moka . 
  i drink a cup of coffee with some drops of milk . 
  then i get dressed , i go to bathroom for the second time . 
  8:10 leave my house to accompany my daughter to kindergarten by car . 
  8:45 i arrive at university for lessons 13:15 lunch at home 14:00 leave my house to go to work by car 14:30 at work 19:00 at my home 19:30 dinner 22:00 good night . 
  yes please . 
  i 'd like to write correctly in english and i 'm aware of my poor grammar as well as poor vocabulary . 
  i know that many native speakers are satisfied when they can understand my thoughts but i really want/need to improve my language skills . 
  currently i 'm studying for the cae exam ... so i 'm really scared by how difficult is english at that level . 
  my professor once said : `` remember , it 's easy to speak a difficult italian and it 's difficult to speak an easy italian . 
  on the other hand , it 's easy to speak an easy english but it 's way more difficult to speak a difficult and complex english '' . 
  so , still now i find managing complex thoughts in english very difficult . 
  really ? 
  but it is grammatically close to french . 
  and for me an important plus of italian language is the great similarity between writing and speaking . 
  obviously we have irregularities as any other language . 
  i thought : `` mmm . . yeah , it seems easy , let me try ... the pen is on the table , banana is yellow '' . 
  but then : `` holy shit , why do i have to learn a language with so many irregularities ? 
  :d i have a good rain jacket here , siena is really rainy , more than london for example , in 2016 we had something like 1200mm of rain . 
  but the good thing is that generally we have a nice spring and summer . 
  i thank everyday to be born in europe and to be able to make trips around the continent or simply to have the opportunity to relocate in another country for a while . 
  i think it 's an incredible experience . 
  well , it 's really worth .
