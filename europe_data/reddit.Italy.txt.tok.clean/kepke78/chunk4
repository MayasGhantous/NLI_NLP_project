  same thing ... italy did n't exist yet . 
  my city at that time was a republic at war against the spanish empire ( charles v ) . 
  furthermore , we were allied with the french . 
  unfortunately i do n't know how these cartoon has been translated in the other countries ... but these are my favourites : [ ken shiro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1crm94emupe ) [ tiger man ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6oc0clptw4 ) [ jeeg robot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdwd5q0lc9i ) [ capitan harlock ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiwrcsdulpw ) [ conan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usgeltb9e38&amp;t=48s ) [ lam\u00f9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvzplp9y_yu ) [ devil man ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25iq_p1fjvo&amp;t=73s ) [ sasuke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-izoaynsvkk ) [ king arthur ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buhfqmbksp0 ) i think italian soundtracks were really amazing , i cry still now ... 
  my favourite cartoons were all the japan anime between the end of the '70s until '90s . 
  as an italian speaker i 'd say english has too many vowels compared to my language . 
  for example , we have 5 vowels and 7 sounds : a - e / \u00e8 - i - o / \u00f2 - u and you pronounce them as written . 
  there 's also a problem with some sounds like `` r '' or `` th '' . 
  but here in tuscany for example we pronounce the intervocalic `` t '' sound like the english `` th '' : really , really smooth . 
  this is the anthem of the former tuscan nation-state , it 's not very famous . 
  [ tuscany anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxabugo06zc ) as you can see , our former flag was the austrian flag with symbols of habsburg-lorraine . 
  a famous anthem is this : [ lombard-venet imperial anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihrqovtj2eu ) is the italian version of the austrian anthem, 
  economics : liberal/anarco-liberist immigration : generally liberal but tough control over extra-european fluxes to cope with integration issues . 
  social rights : liberal eu : liberal , i 'm federalist and i prefer the europe of regions model . 
  same thing in italy !, 
  we used to say `` chips '' ahaha really weird . 
  today 15 \u00b0 c and some rain . 
  but this is not the normal average temperature in february . 
  ahaha di caprio sounds really italian . 
  there 's a lot of people though and this makes me proud obviously . 
  you have passed the italian celebrity test , well done , 
  it 's impossible to forget two great actors as bud spencer and terence hill !, 
  very interesting thing . 
  i did n't know about this . 
  ahaha , you can also mention caesar , nerone , augustus , san francesco , santa caterina , a ton of popes and saints , archimedes , giotto , boccaccio , dante , mussolini , amerigo vespucci , guglielmo marconi and so on ... 
  lol !, 
  really true . 
  ancient romans ? 
  all dead ... 
  we are a mess with our anthem ahaha ... 
  mmmm ... 
  living : berlusconi , valentino rossi , benigni ... dead : too many people ... 
  it 's really easy to be biased by news framing and availability heuristic . 
  i try to stay strong and optimistic about future knowing that : `` what you see is all there is '' . 
  i think we can not mix up the european culture with the western culture as it were one thing . 
  for me to be culturally european you need to live in europe ( because , you know , architecture and landscapes produce a sort of `` forma mentis '' ) , you need to be influenced by greek-latin culture and philosophy , by french , spanish , portuguese , german , austrian , polish , dutch , ( and so on ) culture and common history . 
  russia is actually a european country but in the last decades it 's also in antithesis with the european common values . 
  i agree ... the italian plane destroyed upon ustica island for example . 
  it 's stable since 1945 . 
  our pleasure is in changing a prime minister every year . 
  ahaha yeah ... our brothers in blasphemy and good alcoholics stuff , 
  i ca n't say all the italians are blasphemous but actually a large part of tuscans are  i mean , here we use certain words as conjunctions or to fill dead spots in a phrase or in a speech . 
  obviously when they hear these words some people get annoyed . 
  italians not only are the most culturally catholic country but we are the most blasphemous country too . 
  a large portion of the country ( or at least the majority in my region ) uses to talk about saint and gods using unkind words on daily basis . 
  my cultural and historical region is toscana ( tuscany ) . 
  here we have a strong cultural identity as well as scotland or other historical regions of europe . 
  at university my english teachers are from : scotland , canada , new zealand and england . 
  probably there is an american one but i 'm not so sure . 
  it depends on where you live . 
  for example here in tuscany if you live in the middle area is not so safe because of our hills . 
   in other part of the country the problem is more related to traffic , so i ' would n't go to rome o naples by bicycle . 
  i went to a private school of cinema in florence many years ago but i 've learned my job only working actively day by day into the industry . 
  i made several short films , experience in a feature film as a second assistant director , an indefinite number of videoclips , corporate videos , video presentations an so on ... now i 'm working as responsible for video communication and as a video editor for an international art institute in my city . 
  so i work in an international place full of americans , greeks , swedish . 
  if you could afford all the costs to live here in italy you may go to study in milan or rome , having a dual-citizenship you do n't have any problems if you want to find a student job . 
  italian alps ? 
  edit ... not so conservative though ... 
  ahaha , narcos is really amazing , one of the most intriguing tv series . 
  for me listening to spanish ( south american spanish in particular ) is very easy although some words or some grammatical rules are different from italian . 
  this is the reason because many italians prefer to study another language ( and on the other hand the spanish do the same ) . 
  unfortunately i suck in english ... and this june i have to do the cambridge cae exam if i want my degree . 
  hi , i work as a director and ( mainly ) as a video editor in italy , here there are only two cities involved in this industry : rome ( mainly for cinema but also tv ) and milan ( tv and video production ) . 
  unfortunately i work in a small city so i decided to relocate in another eu country . 
  i think you should go in the uk and in particular in london but if you want to work there you need a working visa obviously . 
  i do n't know how it is the situation in germany . 
  i do n't know , brexit is destroying all my plans . 
  i 'm finishing my studies at university ( yeah , second degree as an adult learner ... ) then i will see ... in the next 6 months . 
  for my current job and skills i should go in a country with a well developed media industry because now i 'm living in a wonderful but little town . 
  do you know what countries in europe have a good media industry ? 
  these are our skyscrapers : [ siena ] ( http://www.theitaliantouch.org/it/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/centro-storico-di-siena-vista-aerea.jpg ) [ san gimignano ] ( http://www.ilcittadinoonline.it/cronache-dal-medioevo/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/11/sangimignano5.jpg ) a curiosity : not many people know that siena in the past had dozens of towers . 
  after the war of siena ( 1555 ) many of these were destroyed . 
  the last towers were cut after an earthquake in the late xviii sec . 
  [ siena 's towers 1700 circa ] ( http://www.florenceprints.com/images/vedutedicitta/siena/prospettica-di-siena.jpg ), 
  i 'm studying german in this period and i think it is a really challenging language for an italian speaker . 
  i could learn spanish for example but imo is n't so difficult and sounds really similar to an italian dialect . 
  maybe , but it 's not so popular . 
  italy has a long tradition but in these years average level is very low . 
  think about beppe grillo , 
  in italy the eu flag is in every public building , schools , offices , police offices , city offices etc. 
  in my country major sport events are ( in no particular order ) : - olympics - winter olympics - fifa world cup - uefa champions league - italian serie a - f1 - motogp - tour de france - giro d'italia, 
  really ? 
  yes , he 's a freaky genius , 
  probably we need to make only few steps at once but it is important to procede forward . 
  absolutely right , in every case if we were willing to adopt another language such as latin or esperanto we should be ready to plan a long term project ( 2 generations at least ) . 
  this :d [ andiamo a comandare - rovazzi ] ( https://youtu.be/kifn_wvgrem ), 
  it was a wishful thinking of constituent fathers , some of these belonged to the italian communist party ( p.c.i. ), 
  the biggest western communist party . 
  i completely agree with you , in fact still now many people complain about european politicians for everything . 
  in italy is a sort of national sport but political targets are variable and mostly depend on how facts are narrated by media . 
  i would like to see the biggest countries in the eu trying to build something , going forward and coping with each electorate explaining how things could go better . 
  probably i 'm too optimist ... 
  thank you for these interesting facts i was ignoring . 
  by the way , to sum it up the main point is we need a common language taught in europe because it 's essential for creating a more united europe . 
  yes , i understand your worries about the link between latin and neo-fascists . 
  unfortunately the whole roman history it had been used by fascists as a narration of their actions 95 years ago . 
  but as you say , latin is actually one of the cornerstones of our european identity . 
  i admit could be really interesting esperanto but at the same time i thought that when you are studying a language you are involved in its culture too . 
  so when i think about latin i imagine a great history , writers , poets , scientists , generals , phrases like `` memento mori '' or `` dura lex sed lex '' ... 
  i know it could sound childish but , you know , a language is this too ...
