  jobs are simply not a problem to switzerland . 
  do you have any idea what means integration ? 
  what means cooperation ? 
  switzerland benefits from italian workers , economically and socially , and italy benefits from switzerland opportunities , economically and socially . 
  take a look at usa and how it benefited from all those workers from europe . 
  do you think they would be half of what they are without them ? 
  yes , italian economy is not in a good shape . 
  it is wrong to expect that surrounding friendly countries will accept our workers in this time where we have more work-force then jobs ? 
  no one is stealing no one jobs . 
  a native always have a uphand when lookign for jobs , because of networking , know the local customs , language . 
  if they are employing so many italians , is that simply there arent enough swisses around to fill in the jobs . 
  or do you think that italians are a lesser race that should not walk in switzerland ? 
  thats the only possible argument . 
  if that is the mentality in switzerland ( i know it isnt , the biggoted won by a small margin ) , prepare to be left behind . 
  china , brazil , india are coming , and if europe doesnt update its mentality , we are going to become peripherical countries . 
  this stupid decision is more damaging to switzerland then to italy , or eu . 
  if this go trough , expect the swiss companies lobbying for relaxation of imigration laws in the next years . 
  and dont ever say `` dump '' . 
  people are not shit to be dumped . 
  so what ? 
  the , at least , hundreds of italian citizens that will face dificulties should not be helped ? 
  eu should not use its leverage to help its citizens ? 
  if eu want to protect its citizens , it must not shy away from applying sensible political pressures on countries who are not interested in cooperating . 
  thats is pressure . 
  it is not punishment , it is not `` imperialism '' . 
  if switzerland does not want to cooperate in other places where the eu citizens need ( and what is the point of the eu if not protect the interest of its citizens ? ), 
  , all those millions of euros can be better spent on countries that do want to cooperate with us . 
  switzerland is not even a part of the eu , it should not have the same benign treatment expected to a member of the eu . 
  applying this sort of pressure on a country member is not acceptable , but in a non-member that decided to go against the interests of the eu citizens ? 
  it is the least expected . 
  if the eu just say `` well , ok , thanks for trying swiss ! '', 
  it will completly undermine the eu authority to help its countries , and , in the long term , can even signify the weakning of it . 
  also i agree that if too much pressure is applied , it can have the same effect as too little , but this i dont see at all as too much pressure . 
  after all , if the swiss showed that they dont have a lot of intentions to integrating with us , lets send the exchange students and funds to countries that want . 
  he is talking about law , not morality . 
  my post will be about my two countries , italy and brazil . 
  the first , wow , i have to choose one among many famous paintings . 
  from leonardo da vinci i will choose : [ l'ultima cena ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/leonardo_da_vinci_%281452-1519%29_-_the_last_supper_%281495-1498%29.jpg ) la gioconda may be more famous then the last supper , but i believe it is a close call . 
  another thing worth mention from the master , even tough may not be a painting is [ l'uomo vitruviano ] ( http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/uomo_vitruviano ) , that i am sure almost everyone saw it at least once in their lives , at least in the west . 
  if you want to check something more about the great italian painters , click [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_italian_painters ) !, 
  brazil : not in europe , but if the american did it so can i =p . 
  i think that the most famous painting of brazil could be [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6hkan3e.jpg ) . 
  it was made by candido portinari , a italian descent brazilian , and its name is '' crian\u00e7a morta '' , dead child . 
  other famous ones would be [ independencia ou morte !, 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/independence_of_brazil_1888.jpg ) independencie or death !, 
  by pedro americo , showing a idealized declaration of independence by our first king , peter i , and [ primeira missa ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg ) first mass , by victor meirelles , showing an idealized first mass made on brazilian territory .

  hmm thats kinda complicated as the eu is not seem as as single entity by almost any country . 
  i mean , brazil for example treats portugal in a diferent way then any other eu country and i dont see them accepting extending that treatment to all eu countries . 
  it is too much a diplomatic problem for the eu to worry about it now , imo . 
  that would be one of the final steps for eu becoming a federation of states . 
  anytime someone mentions weapons or protections , the threads get crowded with out-of-context specialistics . 
  look , a danish using consonants !, 
  ( well , shit , idk any danish stereotypes , please feel ofended ), 
  after all that he is still an idiot ? 
  that requires some talent . 
  the stupidity and anti americanism in this comments are appalling . 
  edit : `` sigh . 
  americans . 
  trying to avoid personal responsibility and sue people since 1776 . '', 
  `` your reasoning failed at `` common sense '' . 
  it 's americans we 're talking about . '', 
  `` we do n't give a fuck about your corrupt court rulings !, 
  this is a political attempt at spreading american stupidity to the rest of the world . 
  fuck off , you have no jurisdiction in the rest of the world ! '', 
  and no , i am not american . 
  once it is aproved , international treaties get an `` supra legis '' status , meaning that they are above law and under the constitution . 
  but if they are aproved in the same way that constitutional emmendments , it can get a constitutional ranking . 
  thats at least how it work in some countries , idk how it does in italy , but it should be similar . 
  was answering to that guys comment , not to the whole thread . 
  how not having an official language works ? 
  the government have to choose a at least one or two languages to function . 
  what if i bring a document that was writen in a language not common to the country , what they will do ? 
  if a country dont have a de juris official language , it will surelly have a de facto . 
  `` according to a survey published in 2006 , 13 % of eu citizens speak english as their native language . 
  another 38 % of eu citizens state that they have sufficient skills in english to have a conversation , so the total reach of english in the eu is 51 % . 
  [ 1 ] '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_language_in_europe, 
  thats why i vote for elvish being the official language =d, 
  i believe it is correct . 
  they are not beign forbidden to speak their native languages , they are being asked to , at least , learn the language of the country they are wanting to spend their lifes in . 
  at least to be able to comunicate with the other citizens . 
  not learning the local language is a sure way to segregate yourself from the nation you live in . 
  and no , that is not to force muslims out of the country . 
  that is to force foreigns who doesnt give a shit about the bare minimum integration out of the country . 
  he should pay for any proved crimes in the terms of the law . 
  anything beyond that is going to harm democracy even more then berlusconi . 
  dont think i like that piece of shit , but the law and constitutional rights should be respected no matter what , or we are going to destroy democracy while trying to save it . 
  italy is not venezuela . 
  the only way to fix that would be killing him . 
  so in uk you cant go to redtube , or to the porn part of tumblr ? 
  how does that work ? 
  people are downvoting you , but what you are pointing is important . 
  when you compare it with the reporters without borders map , you can notice that the map is very similar , but the diferences , by coincidence or not , are very convenient to the usa gov. 
  it doesnt mean we should dismiss the source , but it is surelly to be taken with a grain of salt . 
  this map is way more acurate http://fr.rsf.org/img/jpg/2013-carte-liberte-presse_1900.jpg, 
  ananas from old tupi , that was the native brazilian language ( one of many actually ) . 
  its ironic that in brazil ananas is actually called abacaxi .
