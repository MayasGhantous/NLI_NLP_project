  i 'm not even trying to state that the opposite statement is true , but i 'm tired of seeing the actions of a couple of neofascists being used to [ question the moral standards of the whole country ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/jul/30/italy-racism-cecile-kyenge-esterofilia ) , while the favourite sport of the other half of the british press is talking shit about romanians and bulgarians . 
  edit : some things that may help explaining our unexpected openness towards turkish people : 1 - with the recession , the populist argument about `` immigrants stealing our wealth '' has lost his grip on the uneducated population , and has been replaced by the idea that the evil ones are banks and politicians . 
  ( as a consequence , xenophobe parties have lost two thirds of their votes and so are barking more loudly than ever to get some following back , giving the impression of racism being on the rise ) 2 - the tragedy of hundreds of immigrants dying near lampedusa brought `` humanity '' back at the center of the immigration debate 3 - somehow our media found out that domestic violence sells more than crimes committed by immigrants . 
  they are still distorting the public perception of reality but at least they are not hurting anyone . 
  - i should stop calling it cecoslovacchia - prague spring when i was a kid , one summer i spent two weeks in the turnov countryside with my family and friends . 
  us kids loved the vacation so much that we went back the following year . 
  i then went back to prague years later on a school trip , got drunk on becherovka , learnt the important lesson that norwegian girls are more fun that my female classmates , and fell in love with art nouveau . 
  in the end , i spent 5 weeks in a country and still know almost nothing about it . 
  bravo me . 
  i drink an espresso after every meal and i drink one between meals . 
  i even drink one before getting in bed , because it 's a nice way to say goodbye to the day . 
  but i think of it as a small pleasure , like food , cigarettes or sex . 
  i do n't overthink those things , feel cool or important because of them , or think i 'm part of a * scene * . 
  look how lame people over / r/coffee sound . 
  coffee is clearly part of our culture , it 's a thing we do and know , but it 's not a culture on his own . 
  i do n't get it : skateboarding , pot smoking ... even growing a pair of mustache seems to have become a * scene * . 
  fuck that . 
  anyway , i might be a little oversensitive at the moment because i 'm out of smokes and i was unable to do my cigaretteing today . 
  holy fucking shit why americans have to turn everything into a * culture * ? 
  people need coffee , people drink coffee , that 's it . 
  coffee it 's not a lifestyle and coffee making is a crappy job , not a secret art . 
  to any portland coffee shop with a vimeo channel , to the anyone who uses the verb `` coffeeing '' , to the writer of this article : i hope you all die . 
  sorry , nothing special , it 's just that foreign comedians often randomly use belgium for comedic purpose , being a well known country with a not very iconic identity ( also the reason why i have n't found a better explanation to belgium wealth ) . 
  true story . 
  also , due to lack of funding it took ages to raise the tip of calabria from the sea and the country appeared for years on maps with a penis-like shape , hence the word `` peninsula '' ( from latin peni , penis ),

   we do n't `` know '' what rights everyone is entitled to . 
  and so the statement `` everyone has the right to express every kind of opinion '' remains wrong unless you accept a narrative that legitimize it ( we do n't and we made laws about it ) . 
  wait , every country 's constitution puts some limitations on personal rights ( association , opinion , even propriety ) , if they are harmful to society . 
  an italian lega nord politician was sentenced to jail when she said that she `` hoped someone raped our black minister '' . 
  of course it 's highly debatable if a statement about history could be considered hate speech , but my point is that the common statement `` everyone has the right to express every kind of opinion '' is wrong ( even outside the not-so-clear hate speech legislation , defamation and libel are sanctioned everywhere i suppose ), 
  the truth is that if you live with your parents the food is always great , the clothes are magically ironed and you get to use the money you earn for partying , designer clothes and electronic gadgets , not for surviving . 
  forget the daily aperitivo after university classes , if you need to work to pay for an expensive room . 
  i do n't blame who stays home , being pampered is nice and having a good relationship with your family too , but hey , if you keep living with your parents for convenience without enjoying the time you spend with them , and complain every time mamma calls to ask if your are coming home for dinner , the problem is not the rent-price or the unemployment , you are just a spoiled asshole . 
  in italian it 's a female name ( it means `` small rose '' . 
  also a type of bread and a good dardenne brothers ' movie ) . 
  the democratic party is working to change the election law and he 's still the leader of the second biggest party , so it 's part of the democratic process to ask his opinion too ( along with every other political leader ) . 
  it 's really not a big deal , some b-list politicians are complaining to get their names on the newspapers , and the press is trying to turn every little thing into a scandal because they have no idea on how to fill their front page , now that silvio has lost his central role in italian politics . 
  it does n't happen only in napoli , in 2007 a massacre like that happened in duisburg , germany . 
  6 people were executed , [ the reason was a long-lasting conflict between two mafia clans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_luca_feud ), 
  this article makes no sense to me , i do n't know if the problem is my english , my ability to read data on a map , or it 's just bad journalism . 
  edit : i mean , the british spending percentage is still lower than most of europe and it 's change is not the highest either ( and does n't mean anything without the data on gdp growth ), 
  i 'm completely with you on the idea that columbus should n't be celebrated as a national hero , i was making some observations on the stupid trend ( at least on reddit , i do n't know how the debate carries on in the us ) where columbus always ends depicted as the worst asshole ever existed . 
  in the end his personal biography is completely unrelated to the enormous legacy the discovery of the americas left on the world and columbus day should be the celebration of his discovery of the continent , not of columbus as a person . 
  every civilization has tales of heroes as the basis of their foundation , all of them are fabricated myths while the reality is much more dark and cruel ( if not boring ) . 
  columbus has been treated for long time as one of those heroes , now we know that the myth is far from reality but it 's stupid to ignore the complexity of history and instead jump to the other end of the spectrum and treat him as a piece of shit . 
  the possibility to trace hundreds of years of history back to one single event is something unique that should deserve more respect and fascination . 
  yes , but in your statistically accurate portrayal of the german population , anal retentive engineers are a minority , while in my stereotypical mind projection they make up the 70 % of the population ( the remaining 30 is equally divided between cdu bureaucrats and bavarian folk bands in lederhosen ), 
  most german reply of the day, 
  i wo n't put him on an european note , but i do n't get the anti-columbus trend going on in the us . 
  nobody says that he should be celebrated as a saint , but give the man the credit he deserve , the whole history of the modern american civilization can be traced back to his actions . 
  his voyage to the new continent is considered by many as the starting point of the modern period , it does n't matter if it all happened by error or by luck , or if he was a cunt , this guy woke up one day and shaped history . 
  also , the atrocities he committed where common at his time , we ca n't hide or forget them but it 's a bit hypocritical to paint him as an absolute monster , when 500 years later the us are still in the business of invading foreign countries , killing their poor inhabitants and sometimes torturing them . 
  pff , we elected an [ hungarian pornstar ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/7/79/ilona_staller_in_parlamento.jpg ) , try to beat that . 
  guilty as fuck , once i asked to a girl `` puerto rico ?

  from an [ interview ] ( http://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/11/18/news/macch_bacio_di_pace_era_un_gesto_di_disprezzo-71239770/ ) with the girl , a month ago : `` i prefer to be legally charged than having to see my gesture pass off as a sign of peace . 
  it was an expression of loathing for the police force and it should be explained in that way '' `` i tried to provoke the guy with the means of a sex worker , of a prostitute . 
  i knew their rules of engagement , that they ca n't react if provoked . 
  i did n't just kiss him as the photo shows , i said things to him to see if he would react , but he stood still . 
  i also licked his visor , i wet my fingers and touched his mouth '',

  i peacefully marched many times against the berlusconi governments with thousands of other students and workers , and the riot police was always standing against us . 
  it 's ok , there have been few problems with violent rioters in the past , and the police is needed ; they are just doing their job , i said , and they have to deal with spoiled students , living on dad 's money , throwing stones at them for fun . 
  poor fellas . 
  but now , few hundreds of scumbags ( truck drivers , neofascists , football ultras ) decide to set up road blocks around the country , with violent outbreaks and coup d'etat allusions , but mainly fucking with the life of workers and commuters , and the police sides with them ? 
  it 's a demonstration supported by neo-fascists groups ( and mafia ) and the few officers that openly took the protesters ' side are probably affiliated with the extreme right ( what a surprise ),

  no way , the economist publishing apocalyptic opinion pieces to push their own political agenda ? 
  we built bridges and aqueducts around europe when everybody else was far behind in the civilization game , but even in modern times we hardly suck at architecture , industrial design and engineering . 
  beside the sports cars , i can mention agustawestland , aermacchi , ducati , beretta and arduino . 
  23/50 on spoken romanian , never had any real encounter with the language before . 
  i 'm tired of journalists writing kind-hearted opinion pieces on how the public reaction was wrong : journalists keep spreading wrong accusations over and over again to sell their newspapers , they show no will to change their behavior , they drive the hatred bandwagon and then they wash their hands by publishing a piece on how the whole public opinion was wrong along with them . 
  also , it 's easy to say that the wrong assumptions were fueled by racism , part of the truth is that when children are involved , it 's very common to accept the worst case scenario as the more plausible , i 've seen many innocent middle-class white people have their life ruined after a false accusation of child abuse . 
  ( and again no newspaper wrote a follow up piece saying `` our assumptions were wrong and our words violent , we are sorry and we will try to be more cautious next time '' ),

  ok , since we 've embraced the scatological route , i 'll explain better what an italian has to go through when he 's vacationing abroad : the italian man 's body is finely tuned , in the morning we drink our caffelatte , maybe we smoke a cigarette , and in a few minutes it 's morning shit time . 
  now , if you are staying in a hotel abroad , in the morning you shower and go for breakfast , where you talk with your travel companions about your shit routine - everyone at the table agrees that caffelatte is the crap catalyst , especially combined with a cigarette - and express your concern about the lack of bidet in the bathroom , for the second time since you all already complained loudly the moment you entered the room . 
  then it 's showtime . 
  who go first ? 
  you go . 
  they wait outside in silence . 
  what are you going to do ? 
  the floor is wet , the shower looks at you menacingly with its shitty wet plastic curtain . 
  you exit the bathroom ashamed , avoiding eye contact . 
  silence . 
  `` it 's ok guys , i 've managed to climb over the sink '' on the next episode : the french toilet is in a different room than the bidet , i 'm going to cross the corridor by jumping naked , with my pants around the ankles . 
  we ( rightly ) judge the degree of civilization of other nations by the presence , or not , of bidets in their bathrooms . 
  the biggest stereotype that we have about france is not `` frog eaters '' but `` people without the bidet '' : we do n't care if they invented it and if its far more common there than in many european countries , someone in the past century visited paris , did n't find a bidet , and now the stigma will stay attached to france forever . 
  it might sound facetious since we are talking about law systems , but bidets are indeed a proud part of the italian lifestyle , on par with pasta and espressos . 
  thumbs up to the pope : born in argentina , gets an absolute monarch gig by being good at his job , lives in a sick place ( where are your michelangelo 's frescoes , queen of denmark ? 
  ) , is beloved by all his citizens and has moral authority on people all over the world . 
  not really as badass as some of his predecessors ( sergius iii was two times pope , killed two popes , fathered a pope and ruled under an alleged pornocracy ) , but still more admirable than many monarchs born with their asses in the nutella ( to use a balotelli-ism ), 
  `` quality of life '' surveys do n't really portray the real soul of cities . 
  i lived in both and i would choose anytime to live in berlin over munich , and then i 'll still miss the morning light shining through the porticoes , the warm colors , and the slower pace of my hometown bologna . 
  everyone would like his city to be as clean and well functioning as munich , but if you say to a roman or a neapolitan that milan has a better `` quality of life '' , because it 's indeed more similar to munich than roma or napoli , they will probably laugh at you ( and then stab you , do n't ever say that ) . 
  you can draw a comparison with the republican party in the usa . 
  its getting dumber every year but it 's keeping his share of votes .
