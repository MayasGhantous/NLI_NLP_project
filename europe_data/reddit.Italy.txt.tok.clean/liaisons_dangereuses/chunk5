  all the patronizing we are receiving makes it look like the other western countries do n't have their share of right wing extremists and xenophobes . 
  stop the fucking hypocrisy please , how come a neonazi serial murderer is considered an anomaly for germany , while a couple of idiots down here are used to discredit the whole country ? 
  also , proud moments from bologna : oldest university ( 1088 ) and first documented abolition of slavery ( [ 1256 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liber_paradisus ) ), 
  token appointee ? 
  over the years she collaborated with many associations dealing with integration , she 's more qualified for her job than the majority of the ministers . 
  mauro , lupi , de girolamo , orlando , lorenzin have absolutely no prior expertise justifying their roles in the government , yet nobody calls them token appointees . 
  but yea , for sure kyenge got the gig only because she 's a black woman . 
  i love that in the body of the article the phrase `` prosecco , italian sparkling wine '' got more mentions than `` adolf hitler '' . 
  wait , i thought that iraq was one of the most secular countries down there , where are the `` true '' islamic states ( afghanistan , pakistan , yemen , saudi arabia . . ) ? 
  their pronunciation was so bad that mexican/spanish words sounded more italian than the italian ones . 
  many times they probably forget there 's a country there , but it happens so often that i 'm starting to think that they 're doing it because its damn funny . 
  they have two heads of state called ~ ~ power rangers ~ ~ regent captains . 
  that 's all i know , it 's about 120 km from were i 'm sitting and i never bothered stopping by . 
  sometimes i 'll make the trip to a place just outside their border that makes great steaks , but then i 'll move to the seaside or i 'll drive to some other small towns nearby with less tourists buying crossbows . 
  the only times they end up on our newspapers is when italian police/army `` accidentally '' crosses their border and they release some very angry interviews saying `` another invasion !, 
  that 's enough , relations between our countries will really suffer if you do n't stop vexing our citizens ! '' . 
  hahah i 'm not joking , [ here ] ( http://www.smtvsanmarino.sm/attualita/2012/12/06/san-marino-sconfinamento-militari-italiani ) are lots of very annoyed articles from san marino tv ( scroll for more invasions ) . 
  and [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/csj124z.jpg ) 's how we are reporting it . 
  maybe that 's also why they do n't vote for us on eurovision . 
  i heard so many times the argument `` you europeans do n't get how big are the distances between cities in the us , texas alone is huge '' , that i got a little disappointed when i saw it 's just slightly bigger than ukraine . 
  if i think about my high school and university classes ( an age group that would probably have an higher percentage of smokers ) 1 smoker every 4-5 people sounds right . 
  it 's still an high number that adds up to 10 million smokers , if you do n't like cigarettes i can see the confirmation bias making you believe that the numbers are much higher . 
  when was the last time you came to italy ? 
  smoking indoors in not allowed since 2005 , and the latest official report says we dropped to 20.6 % ( of the over 15 population ) , with only the 15,3 of the women smoking . 
  his party currently helds the 4 % of the national votes , in the past they reached the 8 - 10 % . 
  it 's enough to put them in a powerful position in the right wing coalition ( without them they would n't be able to reach the majority ) , and so they get to pick ministers . 
  his role in the government ended with 11 deaths due to a revolt against the italian embassy in bengasi , after he thought it would be funny to show up to a television interview with one of the infamous danish muhammad cortoons printed on his t-shirt . 
  i never said it was danish .

  yea great , north africa is mess , people keep sailing to lampedusa ( 50.000 in the few months after the arab spring ) and we ca n't send them back because they get the status of war refugees . 
  we do n't send them to any country , the borders are open and there are more jobs and bigger communities if you cross them ( < - as written on the official `` welcome to italy , african friend '' booklet ) . 
  if you speak of literature you can easily add latin america , usa and maybe israel to the list , literature has been a common ground in the western world more than we think . 
  a sad thing i noticed , talking about european integration , is how easy italian and french film directors in the 60/70 would cross their country borders , shooting a film in rome and the next one in paris , mixing actors from many european countries without confining them in stupid stereotypes , while now you watch the news and they 're painting your neighbor like a distant and unknown entity who 's trying to steal your money in european meetings . 
  i 've seen a guy that spoke only spanish having a long conversation with a korean with a poor english . 
  it involved lot of jumping around , miming , a great range of sounds and it was definitely a very funny experience . 
  `` i 'll follow you until i 've made you look like an asshole '' is a common way of political reporting on italian television , so the guy must be used to it . 
  anyway , it 's berlusconi 's party we 're talking about : their campaign for the ep elections was focused on berlusconi and taxes instead of europe , they had a fixed list of candidates chosen by berlusconi that contained the names of a dozen of his whores ( they excluded them after his ( now former ) wife went public and called the act `` shameless bullshit '' ) . 
  berlusconi pays each month thousands of euros to random idiots for their favors or their silence , when he wants to get rid of them he gives them an highly payed seat in a council or a parliament . 
  so , yea , this guy is probably an arse cheating the system , gg to the italian electorate and to the epp for happily having pdl join their group . 
  to be fair with fini : he moved away from is post-fascist youth many years ago , and in the past year he also exited berlusconi 's party ( making his government collapse ) and tried to start a modern , european , right wing party . 
  he was then for months under the constant attack of b. medias , and i think he probably lost any interest in the political game : he entered an alliance with monti keeping a really low profile , made almost no campaign and failed to enter the parliament ), 
  di pietro is a former prosecutor that dealt with the political corruption scandals of the 80 's , then jumped the fence , became a politician and sat for 20 years in the parliament . 
  he clearly has a very loose idea of our constitution , on the topics of separation of powers and independence of magistrates . 
  proposing him as potr shows a failure to understand the founding principles of our nation and the role of the president . 
  ( if the fact that grillo kept insulting napolitano for years was n't enough to prove it ), 
  sorry , i can only give you a brief summary of few things that come to my mind atm , and point you to the italian sources ( beware , he then denied some of this claims ) : - from his [ 20 points program ] ( http://www.beppegrillo.it/2013/02/lettera_agli_italiani.html ) : referendum in order to leave the eurozone ( not possible without heavy changes on our constitution ) - to allow propositive referendums without needing the vote of the majority of italians , and obligation for the parliament to vote on every legislative initiative made by the people ( this also need major changes to the constitution and could block the parliament work if approved ) - illegality to distraint someone 's first home ( banks would then stop loaning money to home buyers ) - abolition of equitalia ( italy 's tax collection agency , no comment on this ) - on immigration : [ `` citizenship to immigrants ' children born in italy ? 
  it 's nonsense . 
  better , there 's a sense : to distract italians from real problems and turn them into \\ ( football \\ ) supporters . 
  on one side the hypocritical good-doer-ists of the left-wing that would leave to italian people the burden of their hallucinations ; on the other the xenophobes that use the fear of births `` liberalization '' to raise their consensus .

  the nimby movements were one of grillo 's first target audience , when he started touring italy with his show . 
  - [ grillo asks to abolish worker 's unions ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2013/01/18/news/grillo_eliminiamo_sindacati-50836458/ ) - [ grillo to casapound \\ ( neo-fascist party \\ ) `` you can join us .

  now he paints himself as a web guru and the net as the solution to many italian problems . 
  ( also from his 20 points program : free internet connection to everyone ) i need to point out that very few voted for him because they believed all the stuff he says , the majority of his votes are protest votes against the italian political system and against austerity measures . 
  of course , the idea that left-wing parties and workers ' unions are as bad as ( if not worst than ) berlusconi , is the major talking point on which many italians believed him , helped by some scandals inside the party and by the fact that it 's the same picture that was painted on daily basis by berlusconi 's televisions for the past 20 years . 
  at the moment , many of his voters are vocally asking the movement to enter a political coalition with the left-wing party in order to reform the country . 
  grillo of course is strongly against it , hoping that left and right will end up having to make a government together , so he can stay outside and keep screaming against them . 
  dear people of france , fellow italians ; we all know that we won this battle on the field . 
  history is with us . 
  lets sit proudly together on the formaticum podium , looking down with pity to all those caesum savages . 
  it 's really hard to explain grillo to someone outside italy . 
  the best way to understand him would be by listening to the words he screams with rage on stage . 
  he says some true things about stuff that does n't work in italy , and some of his proposals are indeed good , but everything is mixed with a huge amount of nonsensical crap and stupidity . 
  he denied the existence of aids and supported many conspiracy theories , he promises a referendum in order to leave the eurozone ( incompatible with our constitution ) , his agenda on economy can be described as naive if we want to be kind . 
  ( yesterday he talked about covering the costs of his policies by retroactively imposing to the parties the restitution of the public foundlings they received in the past ) . 
  he made xenophobic and pro-mafia statements . 
  he promotes a direct democracy approach but only 30 thousand people voted in his party primary elections ( he 's supposed to get the 17-20 % of votes , on sunday ) , with the result that they will send to the parliament people elected with only few hundreds of votes each ( 86 for the molise region , you ca n't even get elect in an high school student council with that ) . 
  his propaganda is indeed fascism inspired : huge cult of personality and continuos appointment of enemies of the movement that need to be destroyed by them . 
  not only the political parties ( thieves and parasites ) , but also our president of the republic ( senile idiot ) , a famous oncologist ( cancer spreader ) , the workers ' unions ( to be abolished ) and all the press ( criminals ) . 
  he keeps suggesting conspiracies about hidden powers controlling italy and trying to stop them . 
  his followers act in cult like fashion and attack everyone who 's mildly critical to the movement , and they overpower every comment section of major websites and online newspapers ( it 's been found out that they used the help of a media agency for that ) . 
  he threw out of the movement elected candidates when they questioned his behavior . 
  he never went on tv avoiding to answer journalists ' questions and controls the movement political agenda by making statements on a blog . 
  he 's guided by the hand of his shady publicist . 
  do n't ruin the idea of anarchism by associating grillo to it : he 's just a populist that says shit in order to gain consensus . 
  - he failed to build a solid european right wing in opposition to the populist right , joining a coalition with the catholic center and the new right ( both leaded by old school politicians that have been allied with berlusconi in the past ) , a group of outsiders that was never supposed to attract more than the 10 % of votes . 
  when it seamed possible , after berlusconi 's debacle , that italian right wing would renovate itself , berlusconi retired his support to monti 's government , dissolved the primary elections that his party was supposed to held , and restored his alliance with anti-monti , xenophobic right . 
  he then made a campaign completely targeted to idiots in order to win back his core supporters . 
  - monti was respected but not really popular : his austerity measures hit the country quite hard , plus he made some faux-pas ( his pension reform left 300k over 50s without both a job and a pension ) . 
  populist politicians painted him as a puppet controlled by merkel and the banks . 
  his labour minister never missed an occasion to show herself as a cocky and unlikable university professor . 
  also , after he decided to run for prime minister , he tried to dump his respected image of cold and competent technician , alienating the electorate even more : the new monti is now allied with two not so popular candidates , is making electoral promises and trying to paint himself as a man of solid family values ; he appears absolutely uncomfortable in this role and is often unprepared on any political field that is outside is expertise . 
  - many former monti supporters have probably chosen to vote for the democratic party for a simple reason : if they lose , berlusconi is back . 
  true , everyone has his share of blame . 
  with the rise of berlusconism , many found out that you can make easy money just by releasing anti-berlusconi material and they took over , on television and in theaters , the spaces that used to belong to real , forward thinking , culture , now ignored by media and public . 
  we got accustomed to low quality material that treated us like morons and everyone was happy because they were against berlusconi . 
  we deluded ourself thinking that `` not evil '' equals `` good '' and gradually lowered our standards year after year . 
  as a nation , we 've been entirely focused on berlusconi for too long . 
  you won , i 'm going to hang myself .
