  you just admitted that you voted for him in 2008 , after he had already been proven as scum for two times . 
  he had to resign after three years of scandals because he was driving italy to bankruptcy . 
  i do n't just blame him , i blame you too . 
  can we also say that berlusconi completely destroyed culture in italy ? 
  we stopped making good movies , we stopped making good music , we stopped writing good books . 
  everything is fucking stuck in the '90s . 
  berlusconi systematically used his media empire to brainwash us and now we are taken hostage by populist cult-like parties . 
  the stupid idea that left and right are equal and that berlusconi 's opponents suck is just one of the many things that he made italians believe . 
  ( sorry , i just watched grillo filling up piazza san giovanni and i 'm shitting myself ), 
  we elect the parliament , not the government , so the only undemocratic thing right now is the electoral law made by berlusconi that leaves to the parties the power to choose who will seat in the parliament . 
  the center-left party had to make a separate primary election to let the people choose their candidates for the parliament , berlusconi of course has made the usual list of undesirable people that will get their seat if you vote for him . 
  a recent survey revealed that 75 % of the italians use the television as the mean of choice to inform themselves about politics , and if you had the fortune to watch italian television , you 'll understand berlusconi 's success . 
  former cia chief in rome , sismi ( italian intelligence agency ) chief , and italian counterterrorism chief were sentenced last week to 7 , 12 , and 10 years in jail for the abduction of [ abu omar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abu_omar_case ) . 
  25 other cia agents were convicted in september . 
  anyway , there 's no chance that they 'll be extradited to italy and no one really seems to give a shit as long as they do n't start kidnapping white people , so yea , it 's another big day for impunity . 
  no need for that , gomorrah , with it 's mix of violence , urban degrade , ugly people , terrible [ camorra-pop ] ( http://www.vice.com/music-world/neomelodics-part-1-of-3-alessio ) , and incomprehensible dialects , looks already like a distorted and grotesque postapocapliptic vision even to italian eyes . 
  too bad it 's just a small picture of a more complex and sometimes even worse reality . 
  exactly .

  so bad it could probably run for `` worst neighborhood in europe '' title ( and then inexplicably disappear from the nominee list after a member of the jury gets shot in the kneecap ), 
  i 've only been to rothenburg and its main problem is that like venezia or mont saint-michel , the beauty is a little overwhelmed by that disneyland vibe that mass tourism can bring . 
  the opposite problem is that sometimes small towns can be completely deserted , after an apocalyptic early afternoon visit to an old town in central italy , i now always try to reach small towns in the late morning , find a restaurant , feast on copious local food and wine and only then walk around the town until the `` i 'm . fucking.exploding '' feeling disappears . 
  band !, 
  she made a good job on giving a detailed overview on our food tradition , too bad she could n't taste any of that . 
  when you end up living in a rich meat-based culture vegetarianism is obviously a difficult route , but complaining about that is like complaining about the lack of french speakers in china . 
  every restaurant will serve you a vegetarian pasta and give you some grilled vegetables if you ask , but expecting a full vegetarian side men\u00f9 from family based restaurants that serves traditional meat recipes , is probably too much . 
  the poor numbers of / r/italy ( 3.3 k ) and / r/spain ( 1.7 k ) are mainly due to our low english proficiency ( plus maybe the self absorbed national culture of our once-leading countries . 
  internet usage stats are poor too , at least in italy , but for reddit 's core audience ( 15-35 ) we are probably on par with the rest of europe ) . 
  still it does n't fully explain the huge gap dividing us from france , there are probably many other factors involved . 
  portugal 's data ( 2.6 k ) is surprising . 
  edit : btw / r/italy always had a rotation of the most demented subreddit image + taglines combos , thing that always made me feel at home . 
  roman frescoes are probably one of most mindblowing things i ever seen . 
  we all are pretty much used to the sight of ancient architectures and sculptures , they are in the middle of our cities and their styles was imitated and carried on till the modern era , but then you see [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/ppyqesyvmiq ) , painted in the first century b.c. 
  and you really understand how much we lost , in terms of culture and technique , with the fell of the empire . 
  proposed new designs : ziggy stardust , george best , harry potter , page three , marmite jar , `` keep calm and carry on '' , `` please do n't leave us we always loved you ps : fuck you david '', 
  he has 6 ongoing trials , 2 dropped trials after an amnesty and 6 because time limits were reached , he also was acquitted 7 times and found guilty 2 , but he changed the law on false accounting before the could be sentenced . 
  rustichello da pisa , marco polo - the million leon battista alberti - on painting giuseppe tomasi di lampedusa - the leopard giuseppe verga - mastro don gesualdo, 
  many of the white dots are probably just from a single flying shuttle bus , connecting stonehenge to giza . 
  he 's been gratuitously and vocally attacking homosexuals for the past two weeks . 
  the main reason is that mario monti is probably going to run for prime minister and the vatican , who switched his political support from berlusconi to him , is now trying to make their conditions very clear . 
  oh , that 's what people in germany must have thought while knitting the sweaters ... but no , all they get is a dude dressed as a penguin stomping on their work . 
  thanks for ruining the christmas , phillip island .

  pertini was a total badass . 
  classy in our [ best times ] ( http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/images/pertini_1982_color.jpg ) , classy in our [ sad times ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/sandro_pertini_funerale_berlinguer.jpg ) , and [ smoking his pipe ] ( http://www.ilsecoloxix.it/rf/image-lowres_multimedia/ilsecoloxixweb/levante/foto/2012/02/24/26032002%20sandro%20pertini--u1402910434988st-111x177.jpg ) in all the others . 
  also , the slapstick comedy strip by andrea pazienza about pertini fighting the nazis is hilarious . 
  do you live near a ryanair or easyjet hub ? 
  book your flights early , avoid any payed options , travel with a small baggage . 
  some destinations have usually cheaper prices because of airport taxes ( london , frankfurt , valencia i think ) . 
  flights are often cheaper than trains . 
  sleep in hostels , for 15 euros you can get a really nice accommodation in germanic countries or a shitty one in london/paris/barcelona . 
  i usually prefer bigger dorms ( cheaper , more people to meet , less awkwardness , less chances of ending up in a cupboard-like room with a group of drunk and loud australians ) with the exception of london and paris , european cities are usually very safe , just try to avoid pickpockets . 
  lonely planet are good as city guides , also check unlike.net for the trendy stuff . 
  if you live in the north vienna and munich are close , beautiful , safe and clean ( there are also some deutsche bahn trains departing from italy ) paris is probably the true `` if i have to visit one european city before i die ... '' , london too but it 's more expensive and it 's a fucking mess . 
  berlin and madrid are young and vibrant ( and with great and cheap street food ) . 
  budapest is very cheap , you can reach it with wizzair . 
  if you want to start smaller , fly to brussel charleroi and then visit belgium by train ( brussels , gent , brugge , antwerpen , you can reach amsterdam too in a few hours ) . 
  scandinavia is great but more expensive , with less low cost connections , you have to exchange money , and there 's less to see than in big central europe capital cities , so maybe it 's not the best choice for your first trip . 
  i do n't know about germany , but in italy hyperactivity and low attention are very rarely diagnosed as a disorder ( 1600 cases according to wikipedia ) , and there 's been a lot of controversy on the subject . 
  `` il divo '' is a recent grotesque bio-pic of italy 's most hated politician ( after berlusconi ) . 
  italian film production is very often political , sadly in recent productions political themes are just there because they can sell a tame and uninspired film . 
  if someone is interested in older italian political/crime dramas here are some good ones : - the mattei affair - hands over the city - salvatore giuliano - illustrious corpses - investigation of a citizen above suspicion - how to kill a judge - the battle of algers - todo modo - the working class goes to heaven, 
  turns out that an healthy diet keeps you thinner than daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity . 
  who 'd have imagined . 
   wow that paper looks of such nice quality ours look like [ foldable maps ] ( http://www.data24news.it/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2013/02/schede-elettorali650.jpg ) . 
  [ also , ] ( http://www.scriptgodsmustdie.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/american-card.gif ), 
  this chart makes some sense only if you substitute each country with their leaders . 
  this is just a starting point , if you read the names of the 218 you 'll see plenty from m5s and sel and many `` independent '' meps , but the main voting blocks inside the parliament are still not taking side , and with the exclusion of a couple of smaller parties who are openly against it , everyone is keeping quiet waiting for the topic to get a more clear spin . 
  lots of meps are open to vote for it , if it reaches the parliament under the right conditions . 
  surveys shows that a major number of voters from all the political sides will approve this , but the topic is still too controversial to openly campaign for it : if the promoters are able to keep the momentum , pushing the law forward avoiding the formation of an anti-legalizazion campaign ( and to get renzi associated with it even indirectly , which is impossible without a secret vote ) , i can see their chances becoming much higher than 20 %, 
  the degree of delusion and insanity is so high it 's almost impossible for normal people to comprehend what the fuck she 's thinking , or why her family supported and then joined her dive into madness . 
  the only way is to stop thinking of them as religious extremists , but rather as followers of a violent cult , like the deluded idiots who killed or died for manson and jim jones . 
  italy , proudly defending the south : we took one bullet , deflected one to the east ( sorry romania , in reality we trust your workers more than the southern italians ones ) , and sent a praise to spain instead of keeping it for us . 
  i hope you are now ashamed of your yourself , fellow mediterraneans . 
  in emilia there 's was a big cultural shift after the war , most of our parents ca n't speak a word of it even if they were born in a dialect speaking household . 
  in schools , kids coming from smaller mountain towns are made fun of if they speak dialect or have strong accents . 
  in other regions younger people still think that it 's cool to speak in their local dialect : the ones from the north are the worst offenders , they 'll often throw at you lame/rude/sexist / racist one-liners in their local dialect and then translate them to you in italian , as if your annoyed reaction was due to you not understanding and not because we 're not in a fucking sheep-fuckers redneck bar . 
  kids from the south use it in a more natural , less obnoxious way ( except when people from calabria start screaming under your window and you end up shitting your pants , thinking that the ottomans are sacking the town . ), 
  it says nothing about russian culture , in the same way prince charles ' browser history will hardly be a topic of interest for the contemporary anthropology scholars of the year 2300 . 
  by the way , the artifacts might have been inspired by the pompeian pahllic art that was discovered around her time . 
  edit : yep , wikipedia confirms, 
  ah , carla bruni , the quintessential french woman, 
  honeymoons, 
  those crazy amsterdamers , everyone knows that a real dutchmen spend his holidays in a caravan just outside his hometown . 
  here 's the [ pdf ] ( http://download.repubblica.it/pdf/2015/economia/5pr.pdf ), 
  people from former axis countries and colonial powers do n't trust their governments ' calls to arms anymore . 
  beside these allegations ( which we keep hearing because they make everyone happy , from terrorists spreading the fear to politicians trying to turn the same fear into votes ) , the only facts we have tell the opposite story : hundreds of european-born militants are traveling to syria to join isis . 
  the three italian entries at cannes film festival were very strong and are all worth watching : [ matteo garrone - tale of tales ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3hvmpgzl7a ) [ paolo sorrentino - youth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shvjdbqyjqw ) [ nanni moretti - mia madre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4tq6vvppc4 ) the first two are arthouse films with an international cast , a fantasy adaptation of 3 baroque fairytales and a melancholic comedy about aging , the third is a personal exploration on the loss of a elderly parent with a very funny side story featuring john turturro ( although only italians are probably able to fully appreciate all the nuances of moretti 's cinema . ), 
  ca n't wait to watch the winning entries by audiard and lanthimos too . 
  italy mvp, 
  deal . 
  you get the mafia , more debt and unemployment , another bunch of regions unable to self sustain themselves , and you 'll be left dealing with all the immigrants coming from the mediterranean ( the eu will take the opportunity to dump you and build a patrolled wall south of rome ), 
  i love the italian flag and the french one that inspired it . 
  there are plenty of flags with great designs , like the union jack , the swiss one and the nordic crosses , but i see them as institutional symbols , while i see ours as the flags of the people . 
  it took me too long to figure out what was going on with the seated woman 's head . 
  yes , definitely moretti . 
  beside him , i would say gianni de gregorio little comedies ( e.g. 
  pranzo di ferragosto ) and many things by virz\u00ec ( ovosodo ) .
