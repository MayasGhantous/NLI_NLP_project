  hey france , if you want to be a free country too , you should get rid of your stupid labour protection laws and stop wasting money into schools , healthcare , and pensions . 
   you did not elect letta . 
  no one even ever considered letta as a potential candidate , i 'm still puzzled by the fact that he somehow got the job . 
  there will be great architecture , installations and performances , but being a world exhibition centered on nutrition , the real selling point for me is food , and the chance to try and discover proper regional food from around the world ( even strange stuff : fugu , crocodiles , insects ) thinking about that , i 'm very sorry that scandinavian countries wo n't be there , because there 's a thriving modern cuisine movement up there and money should n't be a big issue ( the us even managed to pull off a great project and program without any government fund ) . 
  and the 1992 olympics in barcelona are a case study on how big events can positively change a city . 
  that sounds reasonable , a corrupted country would have offered a rich deal to the highest bribing contractors . 
  but yes , with croatia being so close and so nice , setting up a small space to promote its tourism to all the visitors coming from asia , america and the oil countries , could have probably been worth the money . 
  it 's not so bad , many pavilions will probably complete their office spaces in the few weeks after the opening , but the exhibition spaces should all be ready from the start . 
  beside russia and a couple other countries , they all have completed the structures and are finishing the interiors . 
  [ some recent photos ] ( http://milano.corriere.it/foto-gallery/cronaca/15_aprile_26/expo-padiglioni-ultima-settimana-giorni-countdown-via-a4e603ae-ec2c-11e4-b9d3-aa4aa3ffc489.shtml ) speaking of europe , the [ french ] ( http://inhabitat.com/frances-2015-world-expo-pavilion-challenges-world-hunger-with-a-farm-to-table-design/ ) and [ british ] ( http://www.dezeen.com/2015/04/15/wolfgang-buttress-bdp-uk-pavilion-milan-expo-2015/ ) pavilions are probably the best looking ones , but i 'm sure the spanish tapas bar and the czech pool with dj and models will draw a lot of attention . 
  the only way to stop this would be a common immigration policy , with countries sharing the responsibility and the costs of dealing with migrants . 
  right now it 's everyone on its own , which makes no sense since , under schengen , italy 's borders are europe 's borders . 
  blaming italy for not doing enough , or for not imprisoning people until our immigration system is able to process them , is a stupid way to look at the problem . 
   island in the middle of nowhere  sicily [ you are an island in the middle of nowhere ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/7b95cb7ffd8f9434e8fc65cdf352f5c8/tumblr_n1ykxfha6v1tt3yyso1_400.gif ), 
  you redditors should understand that if a solution sounds stupid enough , there 's a good chance we already tried it : some years ago berlusconi 's government stopped a boat in international waters , picked up the migrants and then drove back to a lybian port , and of course we were fined by the european court of human rights for that . 
  italy , spain and greece are not australia . 
  if europe wants to try a similar solution , we 'll need a common immigration policy and shared investments . 
  europe ca n't ask mediterranean countries to take the sole responsibility of dealing with migration fluxes stronger than their capabilities , or to increase their capabilities by a factor of 10 while austerity and debt reduction are still on the table . 
  either we are all equally responsible , and we all do our part , or it 's everyone on it 's own doing what it can : northern countries will still have to deal with the problem , because the migrants that escape our systems will reach them ( with all the security risks connected to clandestinity ) , but on the other side they can blame southern countries , and their politicians wo n't have to tell their base that they 've agreed on accepting a quota of asylum seekers . 
  right now , it appears that everyone feels more comfortable doing things the wrong way . 
  the number of arrivals jumped from 12 thousands in 2012 to 130 thousands in 2014 ( 2015 will be even more ) . 
  you ca n't rebuild your immigration platform to work on 10 times it 's capacity in a single year , and you also ca n't detain people for months without a trial , waiting for them to be processed by the system , without breaking their human rights . 
  almost every one of them . 
  the only reason behind the decision to replace the expensive seek and rescue mission that italy had in place over the past year with a cheap , pan-european , border patrol operation , is that no one wants to deal with the migrants and letting them die in the sea is the easiest way to solve the problem , hoping that it will also stop them from coming ( which of course does n't work ) . 
  it 's disgusting that 29 countries , together , only managed to finance an operation that costs 1/3 of what italy was paying on his own ( plus all the costs of dealing with 130.000 arrivals ) , in a recession , while we were also dealing with the austerity measures imposed by bruxelles . 
  but yeah , we are the one that get to see the bodies every week . 
  he literally said today that the [ relationship between him and renzi ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1638784/images/o-matteo-renzi-enrico-letta-facebook.jpg ) is `` serene '' . 
  he 's still biting the towel ( sta a rosic\u00e0 ) . 
  and by the way , [ deep fried artichokes ] ( http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/09/dining/09passover1_395/09passover1-superjumbo.jpg ) , only served in the jewish ghetto in rome , are one of the best things in the world . 
   project based contracts are staying , contrary to initial promise ? 
  [ this is my last piece of news ] ( http://www.linkiesta.it/copertura-economica-jobs-act ) ( and poletti said yesterday that all the measures will be ready by august ) also , i do n't get why an employer would pay to fire people who worked 3 years for them and replace them with untrained fresh hires . 
  subsidies will only last for the next 3 years , and should work as a stimulus for employment and to reduce temporary contracts , from 2018 things go back to normal . 
  the most important thing , right now , is to see how and to what degree the active labour policies will work , without them the reform will indeed be flawed and unbalanced . 
   work of entertainment = italian politics, 
   what actually happened was that all the old contracts were left in place , and the old standard work contract saw its job security protections eliminated and replaced with a severance of 1 month of pay for every year of seniority . 
  unemployment benefits were reshuffled but left essentially unchanged , and no work placement or re-training program has even been mentioned . 
  that 's not true , the law gave to the government the guidelines for writing the new regulations , and many of them are still being written in their final form . 
  some were already revealed in details and are waiting to be issued ( the scrapping of project based contracts , new regulations on maternity leaves and against fake freelance contracts ) while others are still being worked on ( concerning the training and work placement ) . 
  the new unemployment benefits are a big improvement over the old ones : much easier to get , with higher maximum cap and with a fairer computation of the due benefit . 
  the lower protections of the new permanent contract came side by side with huge economic incentives for employers that choose it over short term contracts . 
  overall , the law is not perfect or dreamlike , but it 's probably more balanced , cohesive and relevant to the modern labour market , than what we had before ( which was ok for some and terrible for many ), 
  the supreme court declared the appeal process invalid , so they had to move the case to another court and redo that . 
  the third guy ( and now only culprit ) took the short route and his trial ended in 2010 . 
  once you get used to , `` hi !, 
  - hey !,

  [ ok ] ( http://media1.giphy.com/media/1szevdpeizdr2/giphy.gif ), 
  i 'm not an expat , but during my erasmus year in munich i gradually became aware of the greyness of the urban environment , something i did n't expect to affect me . 
  for comparison : [ the city i was born in ] ( http://www.blog-ville.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bologna.jpg ) vs [ munich ] ( http://www.julia-mathewson.com/photos/europe_2008_photos1/2munich03.jpg ), 
  decent families do n't fight over money and take care of their problematic members . 
  why should i treat the many great people in the south as enemies , when their only difference from me is that i was gifted with a pampered youth while they had to grow up in a more hostile environment ? 
  for most of the local population they are like big bullies , who scare you into doing what they want . 
  the potential solutions are : - police work : catch the leaders , track the money-flow , offer protection to people under threat . 
  we are fairly good at it , but sometimes it feels like emptying a river with a bucket . 
  - cultural : schools and many associations are working every day to support the civic reaction against the mafias . 
  they have done huge progresses in the past 30 years . 
  - economic : fight the degrade in many southern neighborhoods . 
  this is the hardest task because the quest to build a clean and functioning economy and political class in mafia controlled territories has proven very hard , and a huge part of the money we have been throwing south for the past century ended up wasted . 
  this is also quite annoying for taxpayers in the northern regions , hence the lega nord party : as you can see [ here ] ( https://s1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/nw5bhegvakfh0qyesvolng--/yxbwawq9ew5ld3m7ct04ntt3ptyxma--/http://l.yimg.com/os/653/2012/06/21/regioni-tasse-jpg_131046.jpg ) , lombardia only gets to use 2/3 of it 's taxes , while calabria spends twice the amount it collects , more than lombardia , and yet they often ca n't manage to not look like a open air dumpster . 
  the claim came from `` il fatto quotidiano '' ( an obnoxious newspaper founded in 2009 to cash in on the political scandals surrounding berlusconi ) who opened with `` berlusconi says fat-ass to merkel '' . 
  they are now saying that they never wrote that such recording existed , but that there were gossips about it coming from berlusconi 's entourage . 
  anyway , absolutely no proofs to support the claim , but since everybody liked the story ( b. 
  's fanbase included ) , they happily shared it without asking further questions . 
  only in italian , i 'm afraid . 
  [ here 's a full recap ] ( http://www.ilpost.it/filippofacci/2015/03/13/culone-che-non-lo-erano/ ) , but the basic story is simple : berlusconi is on trial for the prostitution scandal , many of his wiretapped phone calls are published on newspapers , one of them writing a bunch of articles based on the claim that in one of the recordings berlusconi 's heard calling merkel `` unfuckable lardass '' . 
  the news spreads quickly around the world , then four years later the trial ends , all the trial documents are made public , and it 's discovered that the remark on the chancellor never existed to begin with . 
  they 're in the un security council, 
  by the way , did you know that the famous `` unfuckable lardass '' comment by berlusconi on merkel never happened , an italian newspaper made up the whole story and the truth surfaced years later , when the full wiretaps became public . 
  you really do n't need doctored proofs to sell a fake story to the world , people will believe a story they like . 
  even here , it was easier to side with the fake or the double-fake arguments rather than saying that we were n't able to know the truth until all the parts involved revealed the real story . 
   italy has strong business links with russia more than that , the reason renzi visited russia and egypt in the past weeks ( and will meet with obama in april ) is libia, 
  there are multiple production lines ( nh90 are built by a consortium of european companies ) , and i 'm quite sure germany made theirs ( [ firsts source i 've found ] ( http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/germany-calls-a-halt-to-nh90-flights-over-safety-fears-408844/ ) ), 
  they were built by airbus in germany, 
  well , he 's not really immune nor laughing . 
  in the past year he was forced to leave the parliament and to partake social work duties , his only way to remain politically relevant was to bend before renzi , who proceeded to fuck him harshly . 
  he used him to become prime minister , got a huge win in the european elections , pushed his reforms forward , made the 5 star movement irrelevant , and then elected the president of the republic of his choice , making berlusconi look like a fool and leaving his party in ruins . 
  no more sex parties too , i 'm afraid . 
  the trial was a joke , they never had solid charges to begin with . 
  having said that , an acquittal does n't change the moral and political judgments on the events : a ) he 's an old , deluded narcissist , a male chauvinist , a gigantic douchebag , but i do n't think his sex escapades can be considered unethical or immoral . 
  speaking of ethics , i 'm more concerned by the actions of the press and the magistrates , on this case . 
  b ) on the political side , this story is very compromising : the guy is constantly blackmailed and is constantly paying a large network of people for their silence . 
  he 's also completely delusional and unable to deal with reality , not a good thing when you are ruling a country . 
  `` storm '' = the troglodytes who are trying to build an italian lepenist right wing did their usual hate mongering routine , and the press as usual helps them by giving to their stupid boutades more credit than they will ever deserve . 
   [ now explain that `` out '' for italy . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwepl4aujy8&amp;spfreload=10 ), 
  great , now french people know that we call our election laws with stupid names ( porcellum , mattarellum ) . 
  it all started in the 90s , when a journalist sarcastically gave a pseudo-latin name to the election law drafted by sergio mattarella ( our current president ) , calling it mattarellum . 
  everyone adopted the new name . 
  years passed , berlusconi 's government changed the law , but it turned out to be so bad that even the man who wrote it described it as a `` porcata '' ( bullshit , or , more literally , something made by/for pigs ) . 
  so the new law became the porcellum , and for years politicians , journalists and common men seriously debated the topic by referring to it as bullshitellum . 
  renzi promptly nicknamed his law italicum , in order to prevent journalists to attach a more degrading name to it . 
  aside of the shallow opposition to the current government , the major concern for some commentators is that the reform will strongly alter the current checks and balances of our system , turning it in some sort of presidentialism by putting too much powers in the hand of the government . 
  but our old political system has always resulted in low governability and ultra-slow lawmaking , and now that we moved from a bipolarized parliament ( left-right ) to a mexican standoff featuring three major parties , a reform is needed . 
  with the rise of populist parties alongside the classical left and right wings , it 's a problem for most of europe . 
  some systems , like french presidentialism , can easily handle the new wave of politics , but spain for example is fucked like us , and unable to form a government . 
  it 's not a good or bad thing , it 's a thing . 
  and it 's not limited to italians but also every other immigrant , from northern africa to eastern europe . 
  chinese shop owners undercut normal prices by basically working impossible shifts , i know chinese people that spent their youth without ever seeing their fathers .
