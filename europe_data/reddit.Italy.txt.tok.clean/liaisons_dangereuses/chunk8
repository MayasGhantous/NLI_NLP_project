  because they are willing to accept workloads that are not bearable by the european standards of life . 
  they worked on dams from china to the us , it 's not because those countries lack the competence , just the usual call for bids , i assume . 
  googled wlosi , [ this ] ( http://ruchlgbt.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seksowni-w\u0142osi-290x290.jpg ) picture comes up as the first image result , now confused if a raging hard-on is the appropriate reaction , for an italian heterosexual man . 
  rivalry that obviously peaked between 1998 and 2006 thanks to football . 
   good cuisine , joie de vivre yes , germany might be your trustworthy hey-diddly-ho neighbor and you like to measure your dick with the brits , but when it comes to lust , gluttony and swagger it 's us against the world . 
  spain is officially invited too , they missed [ la grande bouffe ] ( http://www.smarknews.it/press/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/la-grande-abbuffata.jpg ) but it 's never too late . 
   ` ndrangheta is able to skew the statistics that badly that +1.7 over the national average adds up to around 33 deaths , so it only takes a feud between two families to skew the statistics . 
  edit : to put things in perspective , if chicago had the same population of calabria , they would have reached their annual murder quota by february, 
   bad politics in the last ~ ~ 22 ~ ~ ~ ~ 70 ~ ~ ~ ~ 94 ~ ~ 154 years i guess, 
  wald --  guaud --  guddefi looks like a chinese whispers game gone really wrong . 
  italians want the civil unions ( [ source ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/475710/slide_475710_6491964_compressed.jpg ) ) , the problem is political : our post war history begun with 50 years of christian-democratic governments , with a really strong bond with the vatican , then in the past 20 years the parliament evolved into a center-right group with a christian and post-fascist background ( highly conservative about civil rights ) , and a center-left group featuring former-communists also mixed with former christian democrats . 
  the few times a left-wing coalition won the elections , their majority was so small that the former cds were able to veto everything that was n't approved by the vatican ( the last time a civil union law was proposed , in 2007 , they killed the government ) . 
  the problem is still here , but the catholics/communists subdivision of our politics is fading and now the parliament seems to have the numbers required . 
  [ i think they got it from france ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_manif_pour_tous ), 
  it 's a small isolated municipality , probably inhabited by old people , there are plenty like that all over italy . 
  the poorest `` real '' cities are of course in the south . 
  italy should be closer to spain than to england , considering how messed up is the south , but that would mean a big step down for the eu budget , since we are the third largest contributor . 
  it 's actually worst , the kia tries to be cool and young and futuristic , and fails miserably . 
  the multipla was just like `` i 'm not retarded , i 'm * special * ! '' . 
  it was the fannypack of cars , and so it became very popular within the `` i 'm not uncool , i 'm a dad ! '', 
  audience . 
  i only managed to find data about the the poorest municipality ( by median income ) , so it 's about villages rather than cities , but i 'm going to post it anyway because it 's kinda funny : poorest municipality : valsolda , lombardy . 
  population : 1.592 [ looks lovely ] ( http://www.visitfai.it/villafogazzaroroi/img/fotogallery/majno09.jpg ) the richest : basiglio , lombardy . 
  population : 7.780 an [ ugly development ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/europaconcorsi/project_covers/1337646/contrasto_milano_3.jpg ) outside milan , built in the 80s by entrepreneur silvio berlusconi . 
  wealthy people live there because it also hosts the headquarters of few multinational companies , i hope , not because it looks like the poor man 's 80s milanese yuppie dream of a garden town . 
  look at their [ stupid artificial pond ] ( http://www.dietrolanotizia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/basiglio.jpg ) , it 's almost like living in valsolda but so close to milan !, 
  alright but totti comes in a close second, 
  there are many people that live under 24/7 police protection after receiving a threat from the mafia , but it 's a shitty shitty life . 
  and if they still want to kill you , they do : if you look at the photos above , they killed falcone by blowing up an highway . 
  the only safety is in the numbers , it was news few days ago that the shop owners of a town decided to all stop paying extortion money , sending 22 mafiosi to jail . 
  no-one also considers how much more difficult is for french , spaniards or italians to learn english , compared to dutch or scandinavian people . 
  we have different sets of sounds and different ways of phrasing ; i 'm always amazed by how some norwegians , for example , speak with ease a fluent english and at the same time seem to have a much smaller grasp on english vocabulary and grammar than me or some of my romance speaking peers , who after years of study and practice still struggle trying to translate our thoughts and to not sound like idiots , and ca n't reach that level of smooth , confident , intelligible spoken english . 
  well we can close an eye on that, 
  [ this ] ( http://arte.sky.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/jeff-koons-gazingball_barberinifaun.jpg ) is the sculpture , not the one depicted in the article . 
  it 's not part of our cultural heritage , but an american piece in a temporary exhibition . 
  the citizens of florence complained about it being displayed in palazzo vecchio , the town hall , yet it 's there for any art lover to see . 
  it was shielded by a screen for a couple of hours to not offend a guest and investor . 
  an easy and safe choice , since a piece from a jeff koons exhibition is hardly relevant when you are giving a tour of palazzo vecchio to a foreign guest . 
  i also doubt the prime minister had anything to do with it . 
  how fucking condescending . 
  many us states still allow the death penalty , they have big problems with the gun lobby and with workers rights , but yet the nyt calls germany retrograde because one year after they fully legalized gay marriages , they still have to move forward with their legislation ? 
  civil rights do n't happen suddenly everywhere because the american medias have become gay friendly , they need political reforms and must overcome all the problems connected to the legislative process . 
  obama spoke in favour of gay marriage only in 2012 , before he was for german-style civil unions . 
  i do n't remember spanish or dutch newspapers calling him retrograde , in 2008 . 
  the italian parliament tried to legislate on the matter for more than a decade but was n't able to find a parliamentary majority on the matter , and even now we had to opt for civil unions to gain the support of the catholics . 
  germany has been led by the same coalition for years , should we push them to change their agenda with patronizing foreign articles or should we let them decide for themselves , under the rule of law , if or when they are going to update their laws ? 
  pushing for a eu army , training with iran , we are definitely prepping for the trump as commander-in-chief scenario . 
  his original proposed [ plan ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/matteo-renzi-proposes-european-migration-bonds-donald-tusk-jean-claude-juncker-border-controls/ ) to deal with african immigration was to issue european bonds in order to pay for cooperation deals , focused on migration , with african countries . 
  sch\u00e4uble said a big no , and merkel later removed the whole african scenario from her agenda ( focusing only on the turkey deal ) , which is what pissed him off . 
  after that he basically said two things : one is that they 're working on a different quota system in order to better allocate immigrants inside italian cities , the other is that we will try to reach bilateral agreements with african countries on our own , probably by rethinking the way we spend our africa development funds . 
  but they 'll probably keep working on a european-wide agreement on the matter , he 's barking a bit in order to put some pressure on merkel . 
  - your majesty , as your scientific advisor , i 'd like to propose that we detach ourself from old viking mythology and embrace the planet naming scheme too . 
  - your majesty , i 've been observing the continentals all week , i 'm starting to understand their way of thinking . 
  saturn , your majesty , tomorrow is definitely going to be the day of saturn . 
  - ... well , fuck . 
  the paranoia is real . 
  if you have an italian coworker , i 'm quite sure he has at least though about the logistics of climbing the office sink , after shitting . 
  and then probably walked back and forth from the sink to the toiler , pants down , moving like a penguin , in order to wet the toilet paper . 
  we do , but it 's less common colloquially . 
  the reason , that i 'm afraid you wo n't like , is that we call the british people `` the english '' , so england comes more natural . 
  we do have a translation for `` british '' but it 's mainly used in the longer form `` british citizens '' and we even prefer calling you `` the anglo-saxons '' than using that . 
  we use synecdoches ( england for united kingdom , america for the us or holland for the netherlands ) because we like sovereign states to have proper names , not descriptions . 
  no bidets + carpeting ? 
  i can physically feel the operator turning the hand crank . 
  she 's won [ everything ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/elisa_di_francisca#palmar.c3.a8s ) * , i 'm sure she 'll get over it . 
  * also : the italian edition of `` strictly come dancing '', 
  we 've got a finnish church too !, 
  [ alvar aalto church in riola , italy ] ( http://www.viaggiart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/slide21.jpg ), 
  yes , that was a later ( mid ' 800 ) restoration , also due to structural reasons . 
  the gap they patched can be seen [ here ] ( http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h3/h3_59.570.426.jpg ) . 
  the restoration method they used is mostly considered to be correct : you can differentiate the new from the old but the new does n't alter or weaken the way you perceive the whole building . 
  today they would have probably chosen a material with a more similar color to the original travertine . 
  the next announced project would be the restoration of the arena floor , almost a century after it was excavated ( now it 's [ open ] ( http://cache-graphicslib.viator.com/graphicslib/media/e5/arena-photo_14419173-fit468x296.jpg ) , in the future it will go back to how it can be seen in the drawing posted before , but with walkable undergrounds under it . ), 
  italian artist edoardo tresoldi built a cool '' [ wireframe church ] ( http://www.repstatic.it/content/localirep/img/rep-bari/2016/03/15/185241312-edec5c8a-2786-4533-b6ab-755731bcdde6.jpg ) '' over the archeological foundations of santa maria di siponto . 
  not really . 
  few hours ago [ i 've replied ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/4s9goo/why_havent_efforts_been_made_to_restore_the_roman/d57qt9g ) to the question `` why do n't you rebuild the colosseum ? '', 
  on / r/italy , with some insight on the matter . 
  the `` questionable restoration '' might refer to the 1806 buttress . 
  sorry but this is bullshit , [ here 's some informations ] ( http://www.acjna.org/acjna/articles_detail.aspx?id=300 ) about jews in italy under the war . 
  jews where well integrated into society and italy is the european country with the higher percentage of survivors ( 80 % ) . 
  after the armistice , the local population kept their jewish neighbors hidden from the germans . 
  the racial laws came from nowhere ( well , from germany ) and where the lowest point hit by ( already disgusting ) fascism . 
  we know about the extraordinary rendition that happened in italy because the secret service 's agents ( italians and americans ) were discovered and sentenced to jail . 
   does anyone else simply find this unfunny ? 
  i 'm with you , it drags forever without a single hint of wit . 
  the po valley , hosting most of our industry , is enclosed between two mountain chains , so there 's no wind to wash away the pollution and it just stacks up . 
  yes , my fault . 
  it 's not , it 's one of the most played songs of the year and michielin is probably the most respected young artist right now . 
  newspapers are mostly clueless on banking matters , this is the result of their standard way of operation : if they can spin news in a more interesting negative way they do , if they ca n't they do n't . 
  in the first case they heard complaints coming from the banking system and they ran with them , in the second they did n't , or heard praise , so they kept neutral/positive . 
  did they , anytime , felt obligated to publish banks-approved content ? 
  i do n't think so , it 's just lazy journalism . 
  the appeal is convenience : you do n't have to fully undress , you are sat down , you have both hands free to properly play with your balls and ( especially if you are a woman ) you use detergents targeted for genital hygiene , with the right acidity as suggested by your doctor , instead of the standard shower gel . 
  how many times people just do n't hop in the shower after a shit / sex , just because it 's a pain in the ass to do so ? 
  by the number of `` i just wipe '' comments , i 'd say that it 's quite common . 
  ( and of course we properly wipe too , before washing . ), 
  what about women , again , do n't they need special care during menstruation ? 
  i think it 's totally worth the little space it takes . 
  sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d are a great feat of sandwich making , when you lack a proper cheese , charcuterie , and bread tradition . 
  what happened is that they hated russia and the uk so much that they organically started speaking in french .
