  i beg to differ on the jokes, 
  thanks !, 
  i lived there quite a few years, 
  i think you withdrew much earlier and only kept a semblance of control , with the usa being the real masters, 
  try scotland ... 
  in england they are only mildly anti-catholic , but still it 's ok to make jokes about them being pedophiles etc even on tv . 
  jokes they would n't dare doing about jews or chinese or any other ethnic / religious group, 
  i would say it ended with ww2 when the usa and ussr split your empire among themselves, 
  * they think they are better than us * therefore they are leaving the eu * they _ were _ almighty and powerful under queen victoria , and uninterested in interfering directly with europe - they did it indirectly , an alliance here , a military base there , an embargo there , a pirate raid over there etc * most of their pirates are referred to as `` sir '' * they sponsored garibaldi first , mussolini later * it 's the kind of interactions with europe the brexiters dream of going back to * except that the empire is no longer there . 
  they still have n't come to terms with that . 
  come on guys it 's getting close to a century now * they even look at boudicca as some sort of hero because she raided and killed about 100k people - that 's supposed to be ok because they were `` romans '' , but most `` romans '' were in fact british subject to roman rule . 
  basically she was the originally brexiter * during victorian times a lot of science , technology , sport and literature which shaped the world developed there * ironically , queen victoria and her husband albert only spoke german at home * until ww1 their royal family was very open about their german heritage , then they invented the surname `` windsor '' because of the anti-germanic feelings * they were n't well known for visual arts and music until the 60s - and then they became fantastic - i wo n't mention any names because it would be ridiculous * they imported canaletto ( famous venetian painter ) and handel ( famous german musician ) * marx wrote das kapital there and is buried in london . 
  the 1st international communist was there . 
  lenin and trotzy also organised communist party congresses there before the revolution * alan moore * atrocious attitude to food ( they see it as mere fuel and do n't care about taste ) , but that has been changing and it 's much better - although those who care about it are labelled `` foodies '' and lookd down on * they go to the pub straight from work and start drinking without having dinner . 
  `` eating is cheating '' * you do n't get table service at a pub * they are generally stingy , although they give a lot of money to charity * europe 's highest teenage pregnancy rate * one of the world 's four financial centers * even they are confused about what britain is - the uk is not the same as great britain but uk citizens are british . 
  and do n't even start on national anthems , they have a few and nobody 's quite sure which is which * they are split into four nations , plus gibraltar . 
  isle of man and jersey technically speaking are not uk . 
  * the city of london ( which is only a part of london , the financial district ) has a strange status with its own major and even the queen has to ask permissions to enter the area * the scots will moan and moan about english rule , then you give them a chance to vote out and ... they do n't take it . 
  shut up then guys !, 
  same with the welsh * northern ireland is complicated . 
  protestants are evil , and have yearly marches to remind everyone of that * margaret thatcher is the evil witch which laid the foundations of today 's world * her predecessor , edward heath , is accused of being a pedophile , and part of a ring which included people at the highest level . 
  the news are slowly coming out * a few tv celebrities and mps have already been revelaed as pedophiles - normally after they are dead * lady di slept around a lot * fought on the winning side of ww2 , but for many years afterwards they were starved and had food rationing * sherlock and other great tv * they do n't really manifacture much , what they do is for foreign companies like nissan * rolls royce airplane engines * they are proud of their history and quite into of war * quite brave , see `` blitz spirit '' or their lack of concern during the ira bombing campaigns * ~ ~ strongly ~ ~ quite anti-catholic - one of the few minorities that it 's ok to insult openly on tv . 
  they even have a yearly festival where they burn effiges of the pope * strangely enough gingers are another minority that is ok to insult openly ( may be a celtic / irish thing ) * they had riots for 3 days in 2011 which they could n't stop * douglas adams * football hooliganism used to be a thing , now they get their arse kicked by russians * drunken tourist hordes in places like ibiza or cyprus * this post is written in their language , which is the world 's lingua franca * ( except for the word _ lingua franca _ itself that comes from italian . 
  take that fish-and-chips !!! ), 
  there was a brief , he basically ignored it . 
  that 's wrong in my eyes . 
  who cares , pointless pedantry . 
  `` racism '' is used as a blanket term for any sort of ethnic / cultural discrimination these days, 
  i am not interested in his journey of discovery , especially if all he does is look up wikipedia . 
  i can go and look it up myself . 
  what i find interesting is the _ stereotypes _ and _ common knowledge _ about this places . 
  if in the us they know little , than so be it . 
   i 'll go out and find some more interesting tidbits via google but that 's not the point , is n't it ? 
  it 's what _ you _ know about it, 
  oh almost forgot : in italy we say that you can go on top of monte bianco * and have a foot in italy , one in france , and piss on switzerland ( the three borders meet there ) . 
  their cheeses have holes . 
  they look down on italians , but they have a small italian speaking section that that almost reaches milan so that rich north italians could easily put their money in their banks and not pay taxes . 
  [ ursula andress ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vgb/search?q=ursula+andress&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all ), 
  * potato memes * miera iela in riga is supposed to be one of europe 's cool spots * second fattest people in europe * one of europe 's fastest growin economy * [ miss latvia 2016 ] ( http://g2.delphi.lv/images/pix/520x315/rglxhvdzagq/linda-kinca-8-47729675.jpg ) / [ mister latvia 2016 ] ( http://missosology.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mi-latvia.png ), 
  i was questioning the `` fuckton '', 
   pa amb tom\u00e0quet you spelled `` bruschetta '' wrongly, 
  nope , just yout average , not-keen-on-southerners northener . 
  are they lost though ? 
  everyone knows where they are , and that they are celts . 
  btw do n't forget asturians, 
  mm ... not really we have a real divide and a political party that was born as anti-southern . 
  myself for example , i define as a northern italian because i do n't want to be confused with one of _ them _ and think unification was a mistake . 
  i will when animals are free to choose, 
  i do n't care . 
  it 's needless animal cruelty and it has to go . 
  hey , i also put a lot of positives in there !, 
  bullfighting still happens , meaning the people who want it to happen are more , or more powerful , than those than want it to stop . 
  besides , it 's not just bullfigthing - a lot of villages have those fiestas where they block off the streets and let a `` bull '' ( often just a calf ) loose on the streets , and people just throw stuff at it and abuse it . 
  ouch . 
  mind you , at least they are not the bard ... 
  i think it 's simply down the fact the catholics made a point of extirpating any trace of the muslim heritage , including setting up the inquisition . 
  that 's why you had _ marranos _ and their muslim version ( do n't know how these are called ), 
   i guess , as long as your definition of living peacefully side by side is `` pay is a fuckton of taxes or convert '' , with the occasional massacre . 
  if by `` a fuckton of taxes '' you mean `` taxes '' , then yes , you are right . 
  can you demonstrate the taxes were noticeably higher than under the catholics ? 
  women , the sick , and the elderly did n't pay taxes , for example . 
  could the catholics match that ? 
  besides , taxes and `` living peacefully side by side '' are not mutually exclusive , and they are much more preferable than persecution in my book . 
  pogroms , sadly , happen periodically in history . 
  again , please show evidence that there were more in al-andalus than in catholic spain . 
    football fans throw bananas at black players  as far as i know , that happened a lot of years ago , if by `` a lot of years ago '' you mean `` no more than three years ago '' then you are correct . 
  http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/05/09/310990212/spain-fines-team-of-racist-banana-throwing-fan-but-is-it-enough   they also throw other fans down bridges into rivers , thus killing them  wtf http://deadspin.com/new-footage-of-spanish-hooligan-brawl-shows-murdered-ma-1665711039, 
  of interest : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arabic_language_influence_on_the_spanish_language, 
  surely el ( article ) comes from al. . . ? 
  funny how you call the muslim an `` occupation '' but do n't feel the same about the visigoths or romans, 
  * they love to parrrrty until the wee hours of the morning * and yet during the fascist dictatorship there was a curfew and people could n't stay out late * down to earth and friendly * yet intensely proud - not in a brexit `` fuck everyone else '' way , but in a `` we ca n't be seen to fail '' way * they had to be _ forced _ to ask the eu to help rescue their banks ( may be related to previous point ) * still , their economy is now growing , although the unemployment is still bad * they were one of the few muslim western european nations , and that was one of the highlights of their history with various religions lived peacefully side by side , and advances in science and the arts * granada is great , the alhambra fantastic * the moment the christians conquered spain from the moors they started persecuting jews and muslims and it all became evil * they conquered latin america , stole their gold and fucked their great civilisations * historically , one of the most useless superpowers on earth . 
  they stole mountains of gold and stuff from south america , yet they wasted it all and let genoese and dutch bankers take it from them * and the british pirates too * they cut most of their woodlands to build a massive fleet to defeat the british once and for all - and they lost it all . 
  they became poor , and a lot of spain has no woodland to this day * their legacy is that all the ex spanish colonies ( including southern italy , the philippines ) are fucked in one way or another * got their arse kicked by the dutch too in some long dynasty / religious wars * although it has to be said , conquering the whole aztec empire with only a few hundred men is remarkable * anarchism was widespread in catalunya . 
  eventually there was a nasty civil war which ended up with a fascist dictatorship * foreign fascists ( germany , italy ) and communiststs ( ussr ) took part in the war . 
  george orwell too * soviets agents there killed a lot of the people they were supposed to help because they were n't the right flavour of communist ( or worse , for being anarchists ) * the catholic establishment was involved ( guess on whose side ? ), 
  and remains very powerful ( see opus dei ) * the german pope who resigned and has n't died yet was also part of opus dei * among the lowest in nato contribution as % of their gdp * guernica * the indignados * corruption and cronyism * don quixote * they have a guggenheim in bilbao , and it 's brilliant * they took baroque and its pointless decorations to the next level * their idea of fun is to watch bulls being abused by men dressed in tight , garish colours , who dance around them with weapons ( although it 's becoming less popular ) * their idea of football is to watch small teams being abused by men dressed in garish colours , who dance around them with a ball ( may be related to their love or baroque ) * and yet it was the best football before the rise of the germans * great food , particularly tapas in the basque region * strong regional independentist movements , not only catalunya but also basques , andalusian , galicia * flamenco , more arab heritage * andalusia is great * dr fuentes was found to have doped a lot of athletes ; but he was made to destroy the samples so nobody will ever be able to prove anything ( see above , `` intensely proud '' and `` can not be seen to fail '' ) * they complain about gibraltar , and yet are doing exactly the same thing with ceuta and melilla * almost went to war with morocco over a barren rock in the sea ( parsley island ) * football fans throw bananas at black players * they also throw other fans down bridges into rivers , thus killing them * motorbike racing drivers , although none with valentino rossi 's class * the whole northern coast looks and feels like ireland or brittany - yet another great place to visit * they even drink cider * barcelona is supposed to be one of europe 's coolest cities ( although i 'd say berlin probably beats it , at least in summer ) * but it attracts all sort of international media riff raff and it 's basically disneyland for wannabe hipsters * madrid is actually cooler , in a spanish-cool as opposed to international-cool sort of way * they hate diphthongs . 
  instead of merging syllables into diphthongs like most languages do , they just speak incredibly fast to fit it all in * they do actually have siestas , although that is changing * churros and hot chocolate * before the dictatorship they had some age defining artists : picasso , miro , dal\u00ec , gaudi * musically they did n't quite leave their mark * british stag and hen dos in barcelona * they freaked out and could n't form a government for about a year because they ca n't handle coalitions . 
  the italians would have made three governments in that time !, 
  italians love putin . 
  stop being a prick . 
  or i could just , you know , voice my opinion and protest . 
  i know that 's a shocking concept for brits , used to sheepishly follow what the media tell them to think , whether it is voting brexit or whatever, 
   the lord said , '' ... not true , the statement is an example of the logical fallacy known as `` appeal to authority '' . 
  it 's `` truthfullness '' is based only on the fact that `` the lord '' said so . 
  luckily i have only contempt for the abrahamic religions, 
  true . 
  but apart from that ... ? 
  well it seems to have backfired ... 
  or you could argue that the uk is set up in such a way that corruption is not needed . 
  for example , instead of bribes you give tax breaks . 
  etc, 
   russia is not an enemy of europe , they are an enemy of the eu and nato well to me eu = europe so that settles it  if we send british soldiers out to die for europe oh spare us the melodrama , you are more likely to send soldiers out to die for trump or saudi arabia than for the eu  if you can tell me what an ` enemy of europe ' truly is , i 'll be surprised [ this kind of people ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/19/the-eu-empire-is-going-to-fail-on-thursday-we-can-protect-britai/ ) . 
  people who were voted in in 2010 , 2015 , 2017 . 
  people who threaten the eu in order to negotiate an exit . 
  people who side with trump who wants the end of the eu . 
  and to think you people take so much pride on your sense of humour ... 
  suddenly i feel trasported back to junior school, 
  o_o when did i insult anyone ... ? 
  are we going to do the same to turks , hungarians , etc. . . ? 
  just because you dutch get a stiffy whenever brits are named doesnt mean everyone feels the same ...
