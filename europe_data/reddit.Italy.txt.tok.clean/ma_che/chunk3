  my wife ( who is german ) first pointed it out to me and now i can not `` unsee '' it . 
  why do you think that is ? 
  even when flying tap they will play some melancholic songs . 
  i remember once i had just landed in lisbon coming from brazil on my way to germany and they started playing sodade by cesaria evora . 
  but you got ta love whole foods !, 
  whenever i am in the usa , i try to pay a visit to them . 
  it is really practical because you can find absolutely everything there - easier than in europe . 
  exactly !, 
  as someone who has to experience the daily violence here in brazil , i can state that some people simply do not share the same value for life as the average european is used to . 
  alas , we europeans need to try to see the world from a perspective that is not ours . 
  many of us expect people from other parts of the world and with different cultural background to reason like we do ( the biggest example right now is how we naively expect groups of badly behaving refugees to eventually catch up with our morals ) . 
  the truth is , there are a lot of bad people in this world . 
  and this has nothing to do with poverty - most of poor brazilians are humble and hardworking , but those who choose crime , wo n't hesitate on pulling the trigger on your head for whatever reason . 
  today i read on the news that a taxi driver was murdered because when they came to steal from him , he had no money to give them so they shot him . 
  ideology like isis ' fuels and boosts violence , but in the end , it boils down to having absolutely no consideration for life - and people like this should be wiped out of the face of the earth , because they inflict suffering upon others . 
  thanks for linking this . 
  i appreciate it . 
  right . 
  what i am trying to explain is that if whoever is biasing the news , do it in a way that fits abott 's agenda , he would not have a reason to keep things away from the media . 
  so i am speculating that one of the reasons they keep it secret is because of a bias ( usually from the left , since the left opposes these measures ) that does not fit his agenda . 
  having said that : not all news are biased or untrue , so he might also be wanting to hide real abuses . 
  but journalists are pros on amplifying things beyond reality . 
  yes , how is that relevant ? 
  my guess is that if the right was to bias the news ( and they do it all the time ) in this particular case , they would paint the boat migrants coming to australia as terrorists and criminals of the worst kind , and cover up any kind of abuse - thus helping abott . 
  i do n't think he would keep it secret if that had been the case . 
  what findings ? 
  you can argue against a strawman as much as you want . 
  when you switch to your barack obama example , you are also switching all the surrounding context , and context matters here . 
  not that i agree with keeping it secret , but it solved their problem . 
  ( i am not arguing whether it is right or wrong ) . 
  because of the inability of the mainstream media to report things in an unbiased manner . 
  the media chooses to follow a left-wing bias and will distort facts , thus making your work more difficult . 
  it 's easier to accomplish things with lying people out of your way . 
   just because you share something in common with saudi arabia means you are `` on par '' with saudi arabia . 
  while in general i agree , in this case you are on par with saudi arabia or china when it comes to censorship and punishment . 
  whether this is a good or a bad thing is subjective ( i find the idea of throwing someone whose opinion you disagree with in jail horrible , but that 's my opinion ) . 
   in fact , life imprisonment ( or other variations such as `` indefinite sentence '' ) is still available in most countries ( ... ) you are missing the point . 
  i am not arguing whether life imprisionment is good or bad ( and if i were , your argument would could be classified as a fallacy known as `` tu quoque '' ) . 
  the point is that i find it to be a horrible and tyrannical idea to throw someone for life in prison ** solely on the grounds of ** what he or she might have said . 
   and it 's the most humane way to ensure that people who wants to build their own societies get their own societies . 
  no it is n't . 
  in this particular case , one should try to spread the values of your society so that they would reach people like the guy referred by the article , together with ** strong institutions ** so that even if you fail convincing people of something , they wo n't be able to harm you . 
  everyone should be treated the same under the law . 
   someone like this needs immediate ~ ~ extradition ~ ~ life imprisonment . 
  no , someone like this deserves not to be given that much attention . 
  perhaps if people cared less about what idiots said , they would just fall into oblivion . 
  moreover , i do n't think throwing someone in prison for life because they said something stupid is a great value . 
  as a matter of fact , it puts you on par with saudi-arabia or tyrants in general . 
  instead , let these people fall into oblivion . 
  that 's what usually happens . 
  and only if not , then let 's knock him down on the debate stage . 
  the logic is simple : there is no free lunch . 
  it depends where you come from . 
  generally speaking , brazilian portuguese is phonetically more conservative ( towards latin ) than european portuguese relative to languages such as french , european portuguese , and romanian . 
  otoh it has a similar vowel quality of italian and mexican spanish . 
  having seen some comments , i would like to offer some insight on the subject . 
  as someone who opposes the current situation of illegal immigrants coming to europe , i also got worried about this law . 
  turns out it is not that unreasonable . 
  let 's take a look at the possibilities : ** constrained ius solis ** in order to acquire the italian citizenship via ius solis , the following criteria ought to be met : 1 . 
  the parents must hold a permanent residency permit ( permesso di soggiorno ue ) 2 . 
  the kid must be born in italy 3 . 
  must not be an eu citizen the key here is having a parent with the permanent residency permit . 
  the requirements for such a permit is : * the applicant must hold a ( temporary ) residency permit valid for at least 5 years . 
  * must provide proof of economical funds * the applicant must prove he is not a threat to the public order * must show he has housing * must pass a test of proficiency on the italian language students , professional formation , those who have residency on humanitarian grounds , those who have requested international protection and are waiting for a verdict , etc. . . 
  in my opinion , this rules out most of the refugees . 
  i would guess people falling into this category are usually skilled workers . 
  but i might be wrong . 
  ** ius culturale ** * must have been born in italy , or arrived in italy before the age of 12 * must have attended to school regularly , for at least 5 years . 
  * must positively conclude the course i hope this helps clarify some fears . 
  not really . 
  to be able to acquire the citizenship one must fulfil one of the following conditions : 1 . 
  be born in italy to foreign parents , and one of them must hold a permanent residency card ; or 2 . 
  those that have arrived in italy before they are 12 , attended to an italian school for at least 5 years , finishing at the age of 16 . 
  the frequency to the classes is to be controlled . 
  refugees do n't qualify for number 1 - their parents are not holding any long-stay eu permit - according to the eu rules ( if i got them right ) , humanitarian visas ( granted to refugees ) do not quality as eu long-stay resident permits . 
  at least not for this law , filtering out most of the incoming refugees . 
  my opinion on number 2 is that if a kid has arrived young enough , and graduated from an italian school , it implies he speaks the language and has assimilated the culture at least partially . 
  even though i am usually against the grant of citizenship like that , i do n't think this law will do a lot of harm . 
  it would be bad if people could simply claim citizenship by being born in italy without any constraints , as is the case in the us and brazil . 
  i am sorry for having misunderstood you . 
  my bad . 
  i am not against muslims . 
  i am against people who have a problem playing by the rules . 
  i am against people who are self-righteous , come to europe and demand , demand , and demand . 
  those who think it is okay to riot , to attack security forces , to hunger-strike , to force their way into the eurotunnel , who behave like savages . 
  i am against those europeans who take matters in their own hands and help smuggling people in their cars cross-border . 
  i am against the activists who have a holier-than-thou attitude . 
  i am against people who are unable to handle a heated discussion with respect and resort to yelling and ad hominem attacks . 
  i am against justin bieber , too . 
  i hope that is enough to elucidate your doubts about my positions . 
  feel free to ask more specific questions , should you be interested . 
  it is reasonable , but it is even better if you take the context into account when trying to understand people . 
  it usually has a huge weight in the meaning of the words . 
  jokes being the most extreme , but good example to that . 
  that 's a very good point , specially when you refer to what gets translated into policy . 
  unlike a reddit post , full of context and that can be ignored at best , policy indeed needs to be clear and unambiguous . 
  the existence of loopholes in the law is a good example , i guess , of how hard it is to achieve that . 
  as for the christian argument , my wish is that people would simply stop talking about muslims versus christians . 
  yes , i know i have done it myself on the parent post , but my usage of christians/jews was just an unfortunate way of trying to paint an idea of regular people - not because i think being of one of these religions make you a regular person , but because i assumed that by using those terms/constrat people would get the idea . 
  but now that i think about it , it was a mistake - in the end , it is about law abiding and respectful people versus the backwards , disrespectful , i.e.
