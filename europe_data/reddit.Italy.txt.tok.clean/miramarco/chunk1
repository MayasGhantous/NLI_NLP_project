  his first move was [ choosing antonio conte ] ( http://www.thelocal.it/20140815/football-antonio-conte-named-as-new-italy-coach ) ( former juventus coach ) as the new coach for the national football team . 
  * pierino gelmini , who founded a community for the recovery of drug addicts , died at 89 . 
  he was a priest , but he asked to be defrocked when he was indicted for sexual abuse . 
  the trial was on hiatus because of gelmini 's health problems , and it is now definitely suspended . 
  i think these may be some of the reasons : * the population is old . 
  the median age in italy is 43.3 years , the 4th highest in the world , and people over 65 years make up 21 % of the italian population . 
  as other commenters said , old generations are still wary of the internet and prefer old-school technology to computers . 
  * the infrastructure is lame . 
  [ the average download speed is 8.7 mbps ] ( http://www.netindex.com/download/2,3/italy/ ) , below the global average of 19.4 mbps . 
  the number of broadband connections per capita is quite low as well ( [ 22 for every 100 inhabitants ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=l6t8doc0rch3u_&amp;hl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=i132&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu&amp;idim=country:it:uk:fr:de:es&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=it&amp;dl=it&amp;ind=false ) ) . 
  * no government has ever pushed for the so-called `` digital agenda '' . 
  there were some laws that , in my opinion , eventually discouraged a widespread internet adoption . 
  for example , if you wanted to put up a public wi-fi hotspot or an internet point , a law required you to be authorized by the police and to ask identification to every customer . 
  this law was supposed to be a temporary decree , yet it had been renewed every year from 2006 to 2012 . 
  * most of the italian economy is based on small and medium-sized businesses . 
  they are not always interested in computerization ( i mean , not as much as big corporations are ) , because it would cost them too much and return too little . 
  * until a few years ago , public administration was not that keen on keeping up with technology either . 
  they have been catching up in the last years , but as it has to be done on a local level , each municipality is moving at a different speed . 
  actually the turnout rate for italy is not surprising at all . 
  the rate for the previous european elections was 65 % , and that is still lower than the usual rate for political elections ( 75 % last year ) . 
  they have * physical * ownership of the statue and for this reason they can control who can see the statue in person . 
  of course , if i own something , i can choose whether i should keep it in my basement or lend it to a museum . 
  what the italian law says ( `` legge ronchey '' , [ link in italian ] ( http://www.archeobo.arti.beniculturali.it/richieste/ronchey_immagini.htm ) ) is that the government can also claim control over the * reproduction * of works of art that belong to them . 
  the spirit of the law is : those works are part of the national heritage , which is one of the foundations of italy 's tourism industry , so controlling how they are depicted in the media is in the national interest . 
  i disagree with that law , but i wanted to point that out , because the rest of the thread talks about copyright law , which is not the issue -- everybody knows that michelangelo 's statues are in the public domain . 
  the ( imho specious ) claim the italian government is making is about ownership . 
  in italy , pretty much every trial can be appealed twice , making it three possible verdicts . 
  the last one is the definitive one . 
  but in this case , the first appeal ( the acquittal you 're referring to ) was rejected by the upper court , because apparently some evidence had not been considered . 
  this meant that the first appeal was void , and had to be redone . 
  yesterday 's news refer to the second take of the first appeal . 
  so , to sum things up : * first verdict : guilty * second verdict : not guilty , rejected by the upper court * second verdict , take 2 : guilty * third verdict : trial will start , will be the last one ( also , ms knox was also tried and found guilty for calumny , because she had accused another man of murder . 
  but that was a different accusation and a different trial , and it is now over . ), 
  pms do not need to go through any elections . 
  they are appointed by the president of the republic and have to win a confidence vote from the parliament , which is directly elected by the people . 
  therefore , mps act as a proxy for their voters when they decide whether or not to endorse a possible pm . 
  italy is not a presidential republic , therefore italian pms are never directly elected . 
  as [ quelar ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14i0pv/bbc_news_silvio_berlusconi_confirms_new_italy_pm/c7daah2 ) said , it 's a terrible idea . 
  and it 's arguably undemocratic : if i vote for a party , i 'm accepting their list of candidates . 
  if the lists were randomised , i would n't even be sure about the candidates that are more likely to be elected . 
  but political leaders will hate it for another reason : if lists were randomised , they would not be able to guarantee that their own candidates for pm would actually be elected . 
  if berlusconi came up last , for instance , his party would end up supporting a candidate who would not even be in parliament . 
  he will almost surely be elected as a member of the parliament , but not as prime minister . 
  according to the latest polls , his party would get 15 % of the votes . 
  its main ally , the northern league , would get 6 % . 
  add some minor right-wing parties and you 'll get 25 % . 
  for comparison , the democratic party , the main left wing party , would get 31 % of the votes -- and 39 % if you add its allies . 
  the five-star movement , a third-way party founded three years ago by a comedian , has 18 % of the potential votes . 
  yeah , * berlusconi has lower ratings than a comedian . 
  * but berlusconi will surely be elected as a mp . 
  here 's why : voters can not choose the people they want to vote for . 
  they can only vote for one party . 
  every party has to make an ordered list of candidates , and if they get , say , twenty seats at the parliament , only the first twenty people in the list get elected . 
  ( it 's a shitty system , everyone knows that , but nobody wants to propose another one . ), 
  so it 's clear that berlusconi 's party will list him as the first candidate in the list , and he will be elected to parliament . 
  ( it 's completely off topic , but ... why does your flair show the flag of angola while its mouse-over text is `` antarctica '' ? ), 
  the economist ran a couple of interesting articles ( in [ 2006 ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/6919139?story_id=6919139 ) and [ 2011 ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/18229400 ) ) to explain the complex structure of ikea . 
  it turns out that ikea actually belongs to a dutch non-profit ( therefore tax-exempt ) entity . 
  and that 's just the tip of the iceberg . 
  i agree on the first paragraph . 
  the way english is taught in italian schools is terrible , even in otherwise good institutes . 
  just to explain to the non-italian redditor : in an average 60-minute lesson , most of the time is spent talking * in italian * about the lexicon and the grammar ( and , in some cases , literature ) , in the same way they teach latin . 
  very little time is dedicated to strictly english discourse . 
  when it 's time to speak , little emphasis is put on spontaneity ; kids are taught to rehearse on the same pieces of dialogue , on the same kinds of description . 
  and as classes are getting bigger , every kid is given less time to try speaking in english at school . 
  ( also , sorry to say that , but most english teachers are excruciatingly bad , and i know from experience . ), 
  but i do n't think that late learners ca n't get better at speaking a foreign language . 
  they can if they get constant , * good * education . 
  the problem with italian schools is that they 're bad at teaching english * in every class * , from elementary school to graduation . 
  an average student has close to zero chance to improve their english-speaking skills . 
  well , `` favors '' is not the best word in this case . 
  everybody already knew that the statute of limitations had expired , so an actual prosecution was out of the question . 
  the only choices left were being completely acquitted or being found guilty but not prosecuted . 
  the latter is clearly the worst of the two , but it 's enough for berlusconi to save face . 
  [ qfly ] ( http://www.qfly.com/ ) claims to `` compare all low-cost airlines in europe '' , but it seems to restrict the search to germany , austria , switzerland and the netherlands for some reason . 
  does anybody know what those dots are supposed to stand for ? 
  it 's the representation of a coin on a coin . 
  ** c o i n c e p ... ** aaaah , forget it . 
  it 's hard to explain the reasons in few words . 
  i 'll try , but remember that my explanation will surely be incomplete : * * blind faith .
