   it 's still a broken window fallacy except we are n't talking of destruction . 
  and saying that my argument was `` this will be economically profitable '' is actually a [ straw man ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man ) . 
  my point was that there 's no thing such a money black hole or economic ticking bomb . 
  it 's going to be a burden , indeed , but nothing you can really discard considering the huge humanitarian service returned . 
  or at least all the ways i can see this happening require some kind of `` fuck them all to death '' argument . 
  definitively , we had some pretty relevant scandal here . 
  though the problem becomes corruption then . 
  and i mean , retrospectively i do n't see those same people that got arrested now , behaving like scouts would n't have been for this international situation . 
  well , in my opinion money just returns to national economy , if this was really everybody 's worry . 
  i mean : it 's not like you take $ 17b , you give 11k to every refugee and fuck it . 
  based on what i know happens here ( budget : ~ 40 $ per day ) 35 goes to the immigration facility for food , lodging , hygiene , clothes and all . 
  which are all italians in turn , if somebody had that nationalistic envy . 
  5 $ is what actually one receives cash and can be used arbitrarily . 
  though , again , i believe it 's way more probably these are used to recharge prepaid sims ( italian companies again ) or buy some snacks , rather than some money burning practice . 
  try to think who 's getting that money . 
  like , who 's being actually paid with that . 
  guess who this money goes to . 
  could it have something to do with the fact you were an actually rich before hitler and shit ? 
  while , i mean , other countries are this wealthy only now for the first time ? 
  i was actually asking for a source . 
  the quote is [ here ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html ) :  it is also because mr. obama embraced a disputed method for counting civilian casualties that did little to box him in . 
  it in effect counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants , according to several administration officials , unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent . 
  i guess then everything depends on what makes them classify a place as `` strike zone '' , and how much the intelligence really know , to make innocence opt-in rather than opt-out . 
  . . for real ? 
   eu must step up the game and do n't allow the low countries and others to facilitate tax fraud . 
  that 's tax elusion . 
  we are talking of tax dodging here instead . 
  two different things . 
  definitively all things america needs , i mean especially considering the past . 
  though , i have this feeling he 's not only going towards the * right * direction , but that ( if unopposed , thing that ai n't happening realistically ) he 'd be pushing his objectives even * too much *, 
  i mean , i see him as the least dangerous of the big fishes , and indeed i technically agree with him on most things . 
  but i ca n't fail to notice he 's no less `` biased '' than the other runners . 
  biases that may match my ideas , sure , but still the result of hardcoded choices , if i can explain . 
  ^ ^ take ^ ^ his ^ ^ nuclear ^ ^ power ^ ^ itch ^ ^ for ^ ^ example, 
  in an ideal world larry lessig , that won me with [ its ama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/3icikb/we_are_larry_lessig_presidential_candidate_maybe/ ) with logic and no additional bs . 
  unfortunately this is n't ( transferable vote anyone ? 
  ) , so i know i 'm obliged to vote one of the big fishes regardless . 
  so i 'd say sanders , for as much as i hate him for being not less bigot than your usual murican * patriot * . 
  it depends very much on which part of the country you are talking about . 
  in the northern regions , i mean , there may even be something here and there , but nothing special . 
  in calabria and sicily it 's not very different from your usual godfather . 
  * you know * , or just focus on services/needs of local people instead of stale primary sector . 
  it 's quite of a problem if 70 % of your population or even more has to work just for food . 
  i mean , if not even producing your own crops is cheaper than importing + value of the product + producer profit ... then you 'd better invest your time in something else . 
   protectionism , which can be easily exploited by corrupt elites , does not always deliver wealth ; but development is much harder without it . 
  this may be a nice sum up of that article , though for god 's sake : read it . 
  do n't just tar everything with the same brush . 
  even if there really where to be any kind of problem ( still undecided ) russia is no third world country , and not even developing one . 
  its [ gdp at ppp per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) is just short of portugal one . 
  cmon , now tell me even syrian , ukrainian , egyptian , tunisian ones have been `` provoked '' , as if everything was democratic and chill before . 
  oh cmon , [ really ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protectionism#arguments_against_protectionism ) ? 
  can you see what ue allowed ? 
  can you see how dprk sucks ? 
  can you realize nobody on this planet is self-sustaining ? 
   that such chaos was caused by the american and french intervention right ... because i mean , it 's not like people was n't already revolting before  in a strategic country for their national interests . 
  oh , yeah sure . . are we talking of the same country where eni now rules basically all oil production ? 
  yes , i did indeed . 
  but non **  ** does n't mean ** < ** . 
  it implies ** \u2264 ** . 
  which in turns can * either * mean ** = ** *** or *** < . 
  guess which i might have thought . 
  i do n't know . 
  * you * were suggesting otherwise . 
  mhh no , i 'll try to spell better : ** a g r e e s ** . 
  not w a n t s. 
  i 'd replace the word `` wants '' with `` agrees '', 
  their own hipster laws !, 
  basically like ours , but theirs !, 
  this : s, 
   these people ( like italy ) argue for their own interests . 
  oh , yeeees , sure . 
  it 's really funny the most anti-immigration party in italy is also one of the closest friend of the president of the country that [ vetoed ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39pknm/spiegel_russian_veto_threatens_eu_mission_against/ ) the un resolution about stopping smugglers . 
   i think they are surprisingly unified given how much money they lose . 
  no , we are n't . 
  it 's a lot more difficult than all white opposite to black . 
  one can only dream in the better . 
  perhaps even not considering themselves as special . ^ ^ gosh, 
  i 'm telling protectionism always sucked , since the dawn of time . 
  also , if products can go in , products can even go out and there 's no intrinsic downside . 
  * bad for people * . 
  of course if your criteria is `` bad for putin '' , nothing but restoring the iron curtain is enough cool . 
  i do n't see why it would been bad . 
  they get eu products that may be imported , similarly they could get their products exported to eu countries . 
  so in theory there 's no apocalypse . 
  practically on the other hand , i have never seen protectionism being a good thing . 
  and more specifically ukraine should n't be putin 's bitch . 
   was n't norway moving to green energy because they knew their oil would n't last forever ? 
  norway can into meaningful no-oil , just because they have a [ shitload of hydroeletric ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electricity_sector_in_norway ) power . 
  now they just have to move the co2-free electricity `` down the plug '' , but i guess that has never been the biggest problem , if you look around the world . 
  oh , electricity prices are [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/energy_price_statistics ) btw , if anybody was wondering . 
  and they are basically half of . . you know , france western cousins . 
  and this is a crime because ... ? 
   you can learn more about the mistakes , improper use of tools , and fraudulent claims bellingcat made here [ 1 ] and here [ 2 ] do you know english ? 
  or german for all it 's worth ? 
  * [ fraudulent ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fraudulent ) * does n't absolutely mean *** imprecise *** . 
  which if any , just covers the satellite images manipulation debunks that probably relied too much on [ ela ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/error_level_analysis ) . 
  what you linked have really nothing to do with my link . 
  if any , the only crazily fraudulent claims i can see , are russian minister 's ones . 
  you know , tankers flying two times their physically possible altitude and all . 
   not to break the circlejerk or anything , but do n't you think they would have conclusive evidence by now if the russians did it ?
