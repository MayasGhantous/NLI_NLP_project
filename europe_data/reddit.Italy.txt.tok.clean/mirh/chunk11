  inb4 trolls saying that was expected . 
  ** no , that was determined ** . 
  ^ ^ by ^ ^ russia ^ ^ itself, 
  they were just going to open to europe . 
  which completely mean nothing for the russian side . 
  unless of course they pretended monopoly over their ex-satellite country i mean . 
  behaving like what ? 
  because you seem to imply ukraine was already `` almost lost '' before the * succesfull * military aggression . 
  i think you have a very opaque understanding of * causes * and * effects * . 
  there would be no shitting around in the east , were it not for russia . 
  and this happened ** before ** any commercial shift or treaty . 
  cool . 
  so russia did n't want to share ukraine with europe , now they just dumped it altogether . 
  so in this unfair world , what 's truth and what 's not ? 
  everything is undecidable ? 
  some ( * the * ? ), 
  party is controlling reality ? 
  can physical laws even be modified at will ? 
  seriously , it 's ok to biased , in the sense we ca n't quit our point of view ... but it 's not like this mean we can not discuss this shit . 
  it 's just about recognizing we are n't perfect . 
  and it 's not like you can say a newspaper is shit just because you * do n't like * things . 
  give reasons and we may agree . 
  in this case i told you why the hell russia seems quite bullshit-prone . 
  you think ** i 'm ** wrong ( or bellingact ) ? 
  fine , speak up . 
  but do n't torpedo whole rationals just with a couple of random words . 
   there is no neutral media anymore perhaps the media were you necessarily truthfully read what you were previously saying ? 
  jesus christ , fuck this shit . 
  you * prove * somebody is in bad faith , you do n't just make wishful assumptions . 
  said this , why the hell should i trust less than russia ? 
  because you know , since a couple of hours after the incidents ( when everybody else was calling for a sam ) they were making junk theories about tankers flying two times their physical limit , conspiracy theories about presidential flights and all . 
  and in the meantime all the shills : `` oh cmon you were n't there , shut up and wait for the official report '' well , surprise the [ report ] ( http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/en/onderzoek/2049/investigation-crash-mh17-17-july-2014/publicatie/1658/dutch-safety-board-buk-surface-to-air-missile-system-caused-mh17-crash#fasen ) is out and it 's 100 % what * some * already knew . 
  we could go on speaking of the [ weirdness ] ( https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/10/08/mh17-the-open-source-evidence/ ) of that buk launcher ( that was in russian territory just hours before ) , but whatever . 
  is there anybody in this world outside your `` biased '' , `` on us paycheck '' , `` distrustful '' criteria ?

  wow . . 
  so much rherotic . 
  or perhaps it 's just there 's this thing called unemployment , and infinite growth is a lie ? 
  what is unbiased in this world if not even osce and un are ok for your tastes ? 
  i mean , it should be damn obvious after mh17 and all . 
  you forgot lega nord, 
  stop calling constitution every half sentence . 
  constitution was n't touched by any of thee treaties/laws . 
   lifespan ca n't stretch forever . 
  no , but the later the year people retires , the more years people contribute to pension system , the more money for said system is available . 
  i 'm not saying it scales linearly but the proportion seems way more reasonable afterwards . 
  besides , fertility rates are what you are talking about , not birth ones . 
  and it 's 60 % only if you omit these considerations indeed . 
   many countries have already been raising retirement age , my point is that there is a limit for how long you can do that . 
  yes , sure . 
  no buts . 
  and i 'm not saying thresholds should be raised above the fine point . 
  though i 'd dare to say that it would n't end disastrously this way . 
  speaking of japan . . the only correlations i can see between the growth of pubblic debt are the end of cold war ( unlikely ) and the [ breakdown ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monetary_and_fiscal_policy_of_japan#national_budget ) of the economic bubble ( quite likely imo ) . 
  that 's when your economy settles down to its `` natural '' position . 
  and i do n't think pumping more children could have any effect on `` restarting the wheel '' . 
   you can only extend retirement age so far , hence why i mentioned life extension . 
  if we are able to achieve some form of biological immortality of course there 's a middle ground between the two extremes . 
  and that 's what i was trying to suggest we ought to find . 
   it 's not really wise to make policies on what may or may not occur in the future . 
  the future is uncertain , but that 's also why we use statistics to evaluate it . 
   without these advances in life extension or robotics or some other advancement ( like artificial wombs ) , then there are only two practical options . 
  either tfr is increased to sustainable levels ( 2.1 or so ) or say fuck it and rely on ever increasing numbers of migrants to plug the gaps in pensions/benefits/workforce ( which is what most have settled for ) . 
  these is both a false dichotomy and a straw man argument . 
  first , you can even financially sustain fertility rates < 2.1 , if people are willing to trade social stability for a little decrease in their funds and/or increased fiscal pressure . 
  and considering they usually are accepting every kind of taxes ( even those meaningless ) i do n't see the problem considering this seems to make even sense ( and please avoid another straw man here : i did n't claim there should be any kind of dictatorship , social police or whatever ) of course asking a little sacrifice to a mason it 's not the same as asking a little sacrifice to mr. trump , but i just guess the key is a stable and positive economy . 
  second , do n't interfere people attitudes from something that may not even depend from them . 
  or may not even interest them . 
  even because you ask for contributions to workers , not general population . 
  and it 's not like the jobs `` migrants '' have , could n't have been taken by one of the many unemployed people . 
  they do n't grow on trees . 
  gaps in workforce ? 
  cmon ... 
  your example is probably one of the less `` evolved '' industries out there . 
  if retirement age has to be proportional with physical fatigue ( and life expectancy of course ) i do n't see why that would need such of an extensive `` stretch '' besides , i 'd replace `` poorer '' with `` dumber '' , if i can explain . 
  the two things in this case overlap , but do n't confuse the root `` cause '' ( you work as a mason ) with its consequence ( wage is low because you do n't need any advanced skill ) . 
   how do you expect to pay for pensions or benefits , when each generation is smaller than the last by extending retirement dates ? 
  if 50 years ago you were already spoiled after a couple of decades of hoeing fields , i do n't see why you should apply the same criteria in 21st century . 
  here in italy we are already having big problems with pensions because some genius around that last century had seen very high birth rates and thought there were n't reasons to come up with a logical plan considering youngs were arriving in droves  it 's not like the only choices are plummeting birth rates or overpopulation , there is a middle ground definitively , but one should take into account both extremes . 
  if i think to russian population , i 'd say that no social policy is going to do something if they first do n't fix the mindblowing corruption they have there . 
   but this thing where each generation is 60 % of the last is suicidal . 
  i do n't know where you did get this data . 
  sure , fertility rate may not be greater or equal to 2 , but remember we are also getting an increeeedible stretching of lifespan . 
  and the two things do n't cope very well in a realistic world where resources are limited . 
  yes , sure . 
  go on with your 20th century utopia of infinite growth . 
  then do n't complain when jobs start to lack . 
  oh right , the good old `` men are animals , animals think to themselves , therefore man has to think for himself '' syllogism . 
  [ best wishes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prisoner's_dilemma ) , you fucker . 
  i guess the trick has been politely asking . 
  i just love how you consider them just like any other weapon . 
  we have a religion hour in school in italy . 
  and at least in the northern regions it does n't revolve all around catholicism . 
  and i can tell you it 's a total bullshit . 
  kids do n't care of these things when they are younger ( similarly to other school subjects tbh ) when they are old enough to comprehend this kind of things on the other hand , it 's not like this can teach you respect at this point , if i can explain . 
  way better to dedicate an hour to talk about themselves and * show * how issues between civilized people are meant to be solved, 
  why even this question ? 
  it 's 2015 , not 2004 . 
  turkey has no actual chance to join .
