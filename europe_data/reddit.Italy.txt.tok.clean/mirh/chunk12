  or perhaps i see the hypocrisy in all of this ? 
  99.9 % of the population is just too poor to afford living in such a city , and the remaining 0.1 % is just * too rich * to such peasant lives . 
  also , you do n't seem to take into account the special geographical , industrial and economic position of uae http://www.thegazelle.org/issue/4/opinion/chumley/, 
  city is going to be 100 % complete in another decade indeed . 
  but first inhabitants were scheduled to arrive [ 6 years ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/masdar_city ) . 
  said when populace think the opposite . 
  when their view supports your position though it 's called democracy , right ? 
  a * ghost * city built by slaves http://www.fastcoexist.com/3035446/eerie-video-shows-masdar-city-the-sustainable-city-of-the-future-has-no-one-in-it, 
  also known as [ omert\u00e0 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omert%c3%a0 ), 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/regions/data/database ^ ^ under ^ ^ reg_ilc, 
  you know , bildberg , nwo , illuminati , and shit . 
  junker has obviously been sent by reptilians, 
   * we are willing to let * [ ... ] is n't assad only allowing russians to help with ground troops ? 
   hinkley point c has a feed in tariff of # 0.09250 / kwh which is $ 0.13 / kwh . 
  hinkley has a strike price . 
  do n't know how you calculate the rest . 
  ps : it 's pointless to compare unhedged power prices ( which would be 0.05 # / kwh ) with normal retail fit and all  i was actually wrong , that 's higher than all new photovoltaic installations in germany : http://www.jm-projektinvest.com/de/de/photovoltaik/einspeiseverguetung[ also , please , there are even us states with lower consumer prices than that subsidy itself . 
  it 's outrageous . 
   consumer electricity prices are so high in germany because of taxes and because the guaranteed feed in tariff needs to be financed man . . you realize that if the feed in tariff ( that still ca n't manage to keep prices low ) is financed with the same money that raise costs , then you have a double problem ? 
  it 's completely fucked up, 
  i linked the pages with the final elaborated charts . 
  then of course if you want to calculate this yourself , that 's where the fun really begins . 
  but the information * is * there , it 's not like iea is used to talk of flying ping . 
  there , notice , i linked you the exact page !, 
  * suprise * !, 
  well , they are incredibly [ strong ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nuclear/comments/3r2s1a/russia_is_building_a_global_nuclear_power_empire/ ) in the nuclear sector : s, 
   the future guaranteed feed in tariff at hinkley point c is already higher than today 's guaranteed feed in tariff for larger photovoltaic installations in germany and way higher than the one for wind power stop this bullshit . 
  i ca n't even see this having physical sense , considering electricity in germany cost [ 50 % more ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/energy_price_statistics#electricity_prices_for_household_consumers ) than in uk . 
  and it 's pretty easy , you know , to have lower prices , when state already paid half or even more of your investment , like for [ wind ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ntpph/wind_power_is_now_the_cheapest_electricity_to ), 
  ok , indeed you are right . 
  it 's like a religion . 
  they * feel something * , and they follow that , without questioning . 
  that 's why you have statisticians to assess said risk . 
  and it 's [ fucking low ] ( http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/73947_en.html ) ^ ^ rs2b ^ ^ d7 .1 ^ ^ pp. 31 . 
  it 's called [ radiophobia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radiophobia ) . 
  you can measure electric energy even in pj , you know . 
  after all w is j/s . 
  and wh is w * h, 
  http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/projected_costs.pdf#67 then , if you are talking about hinkley , you should see that 's probably the first epr ever built ( which how may we say ... was n't exactly the best design they could think ) , but other geniii reactors are doing well , for example in china . 
  also , i should remember you that even its strike price , is still lower than every other low carbon alternative ( and i would n't know compared to fossil fuels , after you account for their externalities ), 
  honestly , i just stick to idea the op gave me . 
  center secular parties do n't burn flags or assault asian people and proprieties . 
  and especially *** not *** * because somebody denied ramadam rights * . 
  mhh i do n't think you are right , cause if votes just moved between mhp and akp , these two parties could still form an coalition alone . 
  and * this * would be way ** more ** of a fuck up . 
  so what 's your argument ? 
  better a hitler than an erdogan ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grey_wolves_%28organization%29 indeed , you seem to speak wisely . 
   any loss of seats from akp would be a good thing except if those votes go to mhp i guess, 
  somewhat remember me the case of russia . 
  denying rights is a thing i suppose legally , being directly responsible for somebody 's death is another . 
  you do n't get death penalty only by being gay ( because punishing crimethoughts is a bit difficult i guess ) the actual offense is homosexual ^ ^ usually ^ ^ just ^ ^ between ^ ^ men intercourse . 
   this one was a convicted terrorist who could not be deported for fear that he might be harmed in his native county . 
  little correction : he could have received death sentence ^ [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rafik_y ) thanks to fantastic middle eastern laws . 
  [ here you are ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-%2f%2fep%2f%2fnonsgml%2bpv%2b20151029%2bres-rcv%2bdoc%2bpdf%2bv0%2f%2fen&amp;language=en#page=10 ) [ , ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/votes.html?tab=votes ) name by name . 
  hazard , right . 
  coal downsides on the other hand are a costant . 
  the second probably causes less problems, 
  on wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wendelstein_7-x edit : also , [ this nice askscience ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3pwetp/in_nuclear_fusion_why_is_a_stellarator_so_warped/ ) regarding its shape . 
  italian translation . 
  also check the op , you seem to miss a link in that * the common people * il 27 ottobre voterai sul futuro di internet . 
   ~ ~ a big part of your population will be scared because ~ ~ ** the future ** ~ ~ out of the eu ~ ~ ** is unpredictable ** ~ ~ as a result they will choose to stay ~ ~ . 
  ftfy, 
  now , if only i could find the interview where putin said he was completely looking forward to dutch investigation . . 
  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/appeal_to_consequences you do n't claim x has no sense because y does n't like it . 
  so y has nothing to do in the debate . 
   now multiply that quantity by 40 years or more of operation of each reactor during its working life . 
  that 's 120 m \u00b3 ( and also 320 twh ) which is absolutely a sand grain , compared to nowadays pollute standards . 
   the amount is n't small , as i said before spain pays areva 65,000 $ per day ( 24m $ per year ) and our nuclear capacity is rather low . 
  do n't tell me . 
  italy has not even nuclear capacity , but it 's still paying for * indefinite * storage ( just not areva though )  my only point is that it 's far from being the perfect and cheap energy source many people think it is , just due to the popular belief . 
  really ? 
  last time i checked [ popular belief ] ( http://www.behindenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/report-costi-energia-rev3.pdf#10 ) here was that it 's even worse than coal :| coal !, 
   and it will only get worse since uranium is a limited resource ( with very few producers/exporters ) that 's why reprocessing makes even more sense . 
  and there 's thorium then . 
   and renewable technologies are more efficient ( cheaper ) every day . 
  https://xkcd.com/605/  perhaps , still it 's a long road till sun can shine at night . 
   there are plenty of renewables plants without subsidies . 
  let me check : kenya , djibouti , chile , rwanda for solar . . then mexico , uruguay and jordan for wind . 
  do you see what this bs is into ? 
  it 's not rocket science that the more and more you approach equator the more solar yield increase . 
  also , it 's not that difficult to beat competitors , when they are diesel generators that cost as `` low '' as $ 250 per mwh . 
  and not to mention that even hell is decentralized in african countries , infrastructure sucks and all . 
  i 'm absolutely sure these kind of plants can make sense there . 
  but let 's just think to developed countries , for a moment ( which was the op argument btw ) . 
  the only one `` touched '' by your source is spain , or even more specifically just [ this ] ( http://english.grupoenerpro.es/project/marchena/ ) . 
  of the `` five 2mw projects in 2014 '' there 's no mention whatsoever anywhere else . 
  after some research , i believe the author just looked at [ this ] ( http://grupoenerpro.es/unsubsidized-solar-power-gives-it-a-go-in-spain-2/ ) without additional checks ( for example for the usual gp bias ) . 
  the legislation is [ here ] ( http://www.ree.es/en/about-us/regulatory-framework ) if you are interested , but there 's a nice sum up [ here ] ( http://www.holtropblog.com/en/index.php/blog-uk/renewables/306-the-new-law-of-the-electricity-sector-once-again-affects-renewable-energy-investments ) ( in english ) . 
  basically , you are not awarded per unit of energy produced ( fit ) , nor `` subsidized '' ( paid before construction ) . 
  but you still receive a prize when you connect it to the grid . 
  oh , and while i was at it , i even looked for [ wind in spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wind_power_in_spain ) . 
  definitively intriguing considering it had peak of 60 % ( [ 25/12/13 ] ( https://demanda.ree.es/eolicaeng.html ) ) . 
  for the records though , the * same * installed base is ( ~ ~ in this current moment ~ ~ three hours ago ) producing less than 1 % . 
  also , some economic consideration regarding [ build costs ] ( http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/lessons-learned-along-europes-road-to-renewables ) could be made  from your report from my report , yes . . but did you look at the linked page ? 
  because it 's subsidies per wh that matters . . is n't it ? 
  like the good old famous [ deaths per wh ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/ ) . 
   i think it 's easier for you to give a counterexample of a private plant that is not subsidized . 
  they all have the guarantee that the us government deals with the damage they cause above a certain threshold . 
  well , i guess that by your definition of subside it 's impossible under current [ international treaties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economics_of_nuclear_power_plants#insurance ) .
