  this would applies to hydroeletric dams too . 
   plenty of countries where the environment is n't very important , or where people are n't averse to nuclear power . 
  so they need a kind of implicit public permission . 
  thus my fear point . 
  and your point about `` environment not important '' seems a bit too bold , considering france has demonstrated completely the contrary with its [ below par ] ( http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/news_docs/c02%20mondiaal_%20webdef_19sept.pdf#16 ) emissions . 
  not all of it can be reprocessed , true . 
  but iirc after reprocessing you end up with three cube meters of hlw per year of operation ( of a typical 1gw reactor i believe ) . 
  now personally this seems a really big achievement for . . how much ? 
  8 twh more or less ? . 
  that 's more than 700k [ us ] ( http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&amp;t=3 ) households for comparison . 
   and it 's expensive so most countries just store them . 
  yes , but it seems just too stupid to have a medium endless cost rather than a big one immediately and then a low one in the future . . to not think i 'm missing something . 
  treat it ? 
   even so , the structured cost prediction is still somewhere around a 60 % capital cost decrease by the time when ~ 15 tw of capacity will have been installed . 
  https://xkcd.com/605/ you probably missed this . 
  and it 's not like you can improve endlessly . 
  notice iea chart is logarithmic , not linear . 
   it 's a long-term average . 
  i 've mentioned that . 
  if there are indeed wide seasonal discrepancies , it 's up to smart people to come up with solutions . 
  yes , but i do n't think redundancy need can be noticed in an `` average '' . 
  i mean . . there 's a reason if half of the day gas plants are running at reduced power . 
  and i would n't honestly know if that 1.2 tw consider actually operating plants or just * available * facilities . 
  also , i 'm skeptic of their demand response thing . 
   i always hear about how cheap is the nuclear energy , yet there 's total opacity about decommissioning costs . 
  mhh , no . 
  there have been already lots of decommissioned plants by now . . it 's not like nobody ever did this . 
  all countries have plans , especially when it comes to [ money ] ( http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf04ap4.html ) . 
  in the us the fund is over [ $ 40b ] ( http://www.nei.org/knowledge-center/nuclear-statistics/costs-fuel,-operation,-waste-disposal-life-cycle )  ( cost which you 'll have forever ) mhh i do n't think so man . 
  there are already a couple of fast breeding designs in the world , not to mention many pwr that have been retrofitted to `` burn '' mox fuel . 
  ... waste ? 
  aside of the efficiency of burning general stuff vs dedicated matter , the problem we have is with pollution btw . 
   you mean the thing that 's falling for solar ( unit-cost-wise ) by 20 % for each doubling of installed capacity ? 
  i would n't worry about that . 
  yes , * [ i ] ( https://xkcd.com/605/ ) * would . 
  especially after you consider * [ pv cells ] ( https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/technologyroadmapsolarphotovoltaicenergy_2014edition.pdf#25 ) * cost is decreasing , not final facility cost ( which needs inverters , structures and labor )  2.4 tw is more than what the world currently uses on average stop fucking thinking for a moment . 
  so , in 2050 us would be using 2 times the world actual power need ? 
  no way . 
  the trick is taking into account all * [ energy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_in_the_united_states ) * needs ( not only [ electricity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electricity_sector_of_the_united_states ) ) . 
  and it 's [ 2.4 tw ] ( http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/articles/i/usstateswws.pdf#3 ) now . 
  so i do n't think a fair comparison could be done in this case . 
  and i do n't even think you can do a fair comparison by dividing 4100 by 365 * 24 , since it 's a bit lame to omit night/day and summer/winter differences . 
  it was suggested to use `` combustion '' for heat [ ing ] . 
  now , what can you burn if not the aforementioned fossil `` fuels '' ? 
  it 's what people usually use in stoves , you know . 
  that or firewood . 
   preferential access to capital etc. 
  is a subsidy too . 
  name me a nuclear plant that did n't get state support . 
  never said it could n't count so . 
  though , you see it 's different from , say , biomass subsidies if you know what i mean . 
   even in countries that are positive towards nuclear power , it 's still subsidized up the wazoo . 
  [ bullshit ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/ecofys%202014%20subsidies%20and%20costs%20of%20eu%20energy_11_nov.pdf#9 ) . 
   even in countries with no organized public opinion or lax environmental rules and/or enforcement , [ name one ? ], 
   there are not private nuclear plants . 
  wtf ? 
  the whole [ us scene ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:nuclear_power_in_the_united_states ) is ruled by privates . 
   electricity does n't smell , they do n't need permission from the public to produce and sell it . 
  engineers do n't . 
  politicians that make laws do . 
   the article actually states 2.5 , not 5 . 
  sorry , my bad . 
  i remembered the 5x number below regarding raw capacity  that urbanized area is 1.7 percent of the country . 
  so you 'd only need about 1.1 percent of the country 's area to achieve overgeneration by a factor of 2.5 purely using solar ( an unlikely case !, 
  ) , a substantial portion of which would already coincide with rooftops in urbanized areas , and thus would n't need any extra land . 
  i was n't talking about land use . 
  the problem was cost . 
  and btw it 's not like you can do very much with pv during night , even if you covered the whole west coast . 
   than the actual average generation already ( about 470 gw on average ) you sure ? 
  because by whatever metric they used the demand nowadays is 2.400 tw, 
  you quoted the wrong message perhaps . 
  please . 
  do n't tar hydroeletric with the same brush of solar and wind . 
   and if we take into account dismantling costs , renewable energy plants will always be cheaper . 
  i call this bs . 
  you can check every country you want , but [ iea ] ( http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/projected_costs.pdf#67 ) even had to use a different scale to make solar fit . 
  by the definition of renewable , not it 's not renewable . 
  but people should stop to live in the 70s and just give fucks to the word `` co2 free '' . 
  for example , biofuels are the former , but sucks for the later . 
  try to think what 's better . 
  you are living in an utopia . 
  even the best battery out there is still [ extremely ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2015/05/01/why-teslas-powerwall-is-just-another-toy-for-rich-green-people/ ) uncompetitive . 
  more here http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/lessons-learned-along-europes-road-to-renewables, 
   no nuclear plants have ever been built without subsidies . 
  there 's a difference between subsidies , feed-in tariffs and loans . 
  indeed , if any , it 's just that capital ( overnight ) costs are higher than any other technology . 
  but this does not automatically imply electricity itself will cost higher ( per mwh produced )  if nuclear plants are so superior , why does n't anyone dare to build them without substantial state support ? 
  because people are scared to death by radiophobia and will rather swim in an oil pool than drink `` 2 times more radioactive water '' , if you know what i mean . 
  yes , it does look like peanuts . 
  and a reactor is usually 1gw . . so that does look indeed like 4 reactors . 
  if then who was talking did n't know the difference , i 'm sorry . 
  it 's a bad thing when the news makes people think there could be something like a 100 % renewable world and we are not there yet because evil lobbies and all . 
  i guess you know the remainder . 
  except you have to power europe , not libya ... and reliable or not reliable , night comes everywhere . 
  on the sea windmills build and maintenance costs increase a lot then . 
  it 's not the same . 
  water requires dams which requires mountains , which requires - in the end - the right geography . 
  and a bit less ( but still quite ) importantly wind and solar . 
  thermal plants on the other hand does n't need anything special . 
  lot of water at most , but i believe that 's available in every country in the world .
