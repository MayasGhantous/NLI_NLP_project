  you realize 10-12c is what you already normally pay for electricity itself ? 
  and this is already a 2x price increase at least, 
  actually , [ iirc ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/6/9/8748081/us-100-percent-renewable-energy ) overbuild factor is around ~ ~ 5 ~ ~ 2.5 . 
  ^ ^ which ^ ^ is ^ ^ crazy ^ ^ btw, 
  so if coal is used in highly efficient plants it 's bad . 
  if you throw it in your heater then it 's fine . 
  . . what the hell are you talking about ? 
  like ? 
  common market ? 
  unified tax system ? 
  open borders ? 
  cause the former still retains democracy and freedom of press . 
  no of course . 
  i 'm not sure you understood what non-nationalism means . 
  you do n't have such cases of parochialism in german lands ? 
  in ` murica that means left . 
  canada is not usa so it can not be * the same * . 
  besides , it 's not like they have n't income taxes too from the other side of the ocean . 
  again : i have no problem with us products ( and people ) . 
  i do n't see what kind of evil proxy ceta is for . 
  said this , trade worked good , but if i had n't to pay fares i 'd be happier . 
  it also made easier for people to quit and recognize them . 
  choice is as always on user 's shoulders . 
  i always thought problems with ttip ( which only * among other things * is a free trade deal ) was the downgrading of quality standards to us one . 
  i admit i know nothing about canadian ones , but since i heard nobody complaining about this lovely country i 'd expect them to be fine . 
  so what is this article trying to say ? 
  how is an us company operating in canada different from any other canadian company ? 
  why should that matter ? 
  -- i feel like this guy is taking for granted nationalism like an implicit principle of the world ? 
  then no surprise he ca n't understand the left . 
  which if any , i only blame not to call dipshits loud and clear enough : no , it 's not us vs them . 
  and wishing for solutions to be straightforward does n't magically change reality . 
  the point is , there should n't be any offense with `` copying an idea '' ( or worse , treating it like a physical object and saying you are * stealing * it ) . 
  where the world would even be if , you know , kepler or copernicus kept all their observations for them ? 
  or galileo had never shared the secrets of its telescope and somebody had been enforcing its intellectual monopoly ? 
  -- aside of that , the point is there should n't be any `` fuck other guys so i can profit more '' attitude . 
  but the future sure is looking funny , with automatization and pension systems hitches more and more questioning the society . 
  will we be able to overcome the `` you would n't do things if you were n't paid '' dogma ? 
   ~ ~ eu ~ ~ copyright law undermines innovation and creativity ~ ~ on the internet ~ ~ ftfy . 
  and to all those that will moan : perhaps you should dump even that `` people have to fight and screw each other '' dogma . 
   this is such a german suggestion . 
  nah , i 'd say more in general more of a latin thing . 
  opinions are n't sacred and can be wrong . 
   no one has absolute knowledge . 
  not even 3 to 5 educated supervisors . 
  in the meantime somebody manages to have * some * knowledge . 
   bureaucracy . 
  technocracy , thank you . 
  this is something i was also wondering . 
  i would really love this . 
  but i guess normal plebs are n't just accustomed to `` fact check '' , if i can explain . 
  better to hear people screaming and finding scape goats . 
  well , come on . 
  you are speaking like we were in 1984 london . 
  they do fucking lie . 
  and i believe you are equivocating two of the `` bias '' connotations . 
  you might say it 's hard for the guardian to concede nuclear energy is a good thing . 
  and that 's something . 
  another is reading on the sun that . . 
  i dunno , eu is no more democratic than uk . 
  there 's nothing enlightened and scientific in putting * you * , or * the party * before facts . 
  and indeed , better if i do n't start speaking of how urss/nazi used to `` convince '' people . 
  you should use logic , not * accept or die * . 
  and it 's not all that difficult to take on capitalism , given i still do n't see how it will be able to cope with automation . 
  unless we ditch liberalism , which would be funny . 
  the eu should spend money on . . advertising ? 
  i think i never seen such thing . 
  fair enough . 
  long live to scientific technocracy . 
  except . . that 's useless . 
  where do you think people `` inform '' themselves ? 
  most here check talk shows on tv . 
  and every day i see bigot spreading fud and utter bs . 
  be it `` pm or mp are n't * elected * '' or `` eu regulations are insane '' < no actual reference given  that 's what should be outlawed . 
  school wo n't solve nothing , especially considering how little kids care of politics . 
   you started out comparing people you have no idea about people you do n't even seem to believe exist . 
  so why all this fuss ? 
   you compared them to children without knowing what motivates them to hold said views in the first place . 
  that based on my experience . 
  you seem to have another and that 's why i asked you . 
  in the meantime i still have n't heard a single sound argument . 
   then you went on about how superior your vision of the world is based on some random articles you googled shortly before posting , hoping it would give you credibility . 
  i know for a fact you have not read them in full lenght or understood any of it . 
  well , you seem to have such an odd definition for `` fact '' . 
  still i have this impression you have n't addressed them at all . 
   if you wanted to have an in depth discussion , you would not need to do that . 
  if i wanted to have an in depth discussion < on sth  . . 
  i would have not needed to link you the thing ? 
  what ? 
   co2 is not the only thing coming out of your car that if even , means there are also ** others ** [ ie additional ] costs too . 
   just because dipshits with a bachelor in economics think its relevant does n't mean the other stuff is not going to kill or mutilate you faster . 
  whatever . 
  if the harm is human produced , the human that produced it shall take responsibility for it . 
  and christ , i would n't know of a more liberalistic claim . 
   there is no special reason to tax co2 emissions in cars other than the hysteria about it , there are other gasses an particles that do more damage to the atmosphere and the surrounding in smaller quantities . 
  there 's no such reason to think co2 is the most deadly thing since rat poison , but . . why in the hell not tax this , and the remainder then ? 
   you either understand it yourself or you stop referencing some journalists who got it second hand . 
  your choice . 
  you either pretend my claim are false , or that they are irrelevant to the point . 
  so do n't do the later , pretending the former .
