   alluding to what adolf does or your mum says does not make your argument any better aswell . 
  considering that without such an argument there would n't have been any famouse adolf or mussolini to begin with , no , it 's totally relevant . 
  and the real shame is pretending i did an argument `` hitler is human , thus humans are evil '' style . 
   whatever your views of the world are , they are not any better or worse than mine , a brexiteers or a trump voters , whom you describe as `` childish '' . 
  yes they may be ? 
  there 's that thing called truth , that the far you are the worse your opinion his . 
  the really childish attitude is pretending nobody can ever be wrong . 
   yours are just different , yes . 
  and only `` equal to yours '' prior to testing them . 
   does n't make you some moral authority that gets to trow around judgments like a pope . 
  so , the pope has authority over crap he does n't even have clue about , while economy bachelors have n't . 
   i despise people who accept them , . . so is [ trump ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-could-still-use-campaign-donations-pay-himself-back-36m-n578036 ) in the same boat of clinton , or not ? 
   living requires integrity living requires logic . 
  that 's the only integrity . 
  a retarded priest , is no better than a wise politician . 
   people taking bribes have none . 
  so , please , again : is taking a bribe `` accepting money '' or is it `` changing your ideas following said money '' ? 
  because in the first case , what ? 
  in the second , yes i agree . 
   she broke the law by doing that ( security clearance requires the use of government hardware , as you do n't know ) yes i do know . 
  i [ also ] ( http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/nsa-refused-clinton-a-secure-blackberry-like-obama-so-she-used-her-own/ ) know such law is [ shit ] ( http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/this-is-the-phone-nsa-suggested-clinton-use-a-4750-windows-ce-pda/ ) and i have no respect for it . 
  edit : [ today news ] ( http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/clintons-private-e-mail-was-blocked-by-spam-filters-so-state-it-turned-them-off/ ) : it department is so dumb they do n't even know what whitelisting is  and the russians have all her emails , go check the news . 
  [ no ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34411472 ) proof [ whatsoever ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hacker-guccifer-i-got-inside-hillary-clinton-s-server-n568206 ) . 
   does n't require any knowledge of system administration . 
  yes , [ it does ] ( http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/clintons-email-hosted-on-exchange-2010-server-now-not-in-chappaqua/ ) . 
  saying that it was `` completely unsecured '' sounds quite frankly suspicious . 
  also , [ this ] ( http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/state-department-slaps-top-secret-on-22-e-mails-found-on-clintons-server/ ) to bake my previous claim , should you not believe in what i said . 
   seriously ? 
  that 's all you got ? 
  not even a le drumpf joke ? 
  he makes money by building houses and skyscrapers . 
  i do n't see how in the world you could move production of real estates somewhere else . 
   sure he 's not politically correct whatever one should care of style over substance ...  tackling illegal immigration and the consequences of one sides trade agreements is a serious undertaking that nobody else dares to touch because people of screaming raycist and adolf and `` nationalism '' . 
  or perhaps , he sees these non-issues exactly in light of all that stuff ? 
  again , what 's the problem with america ? 
  lobbying , bigotry , economy , climate . . orthat [ 0 . something ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illegal_immigration_to_the_united_states ) % of people that comes every year and [ free trade ] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2016/06/09/cox-slicing-global-trade-with-a-ge-carving-knife/ ) ( which i ca n't understand whether you want it or not ) ? 
  edit : or [ trade deficit ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/trump-economic-plan-is-wrong ) ? 
   but he is the only one tackling the issues . 
  building a gargantuan wall , or `` fuck them all to death '' is not tackling the issues . 
  it 's wishful thinking . 
  not better than those morons which believe in a future where peace and rooftop solar is the norm . 
  which i 'd like to point you out i 'm not . 
   still a good reason to not let the psycho organizing it slip away and kill 3000 people later . 
  are you even trying anymore ? 
  so . . killing 3000 people is enough or not to start a war now ? 
  which was right to pursue or not ? 
  and that was started by democrats , republicans or both ? 
  i mean , just to spit it out . 
   i 'm more kantian about the whole morality thing . 
  morality is about people though . 
  i 'd prefer if we stuck to truthiness of claims . 
   using my own limited critical thinking possibilities to the maximum extent is the only moral thing in any situation . 
  that 's just about you and your remorse . 
  it does n't say anything over the goodness of your arguments . 
  and besides , i really ca n't see how under this definition hillary could n't be probably one of the more `` moral '' women ever . 
   there is no reason to shame people for doing it like you do . 
  i 'm not shaming people for allegedly being wrong . 
  i 'm shaming people for allegedly being wrong , and running away from discussions . 
  which unless it 's not even in one 's ability ( in which case they should n't claim anything in the first place ) it could be seen as a corollary of what you said . 
   i 'll let you figure it out yourself . 
  your words , my thought ... mhh what ? 
  first you assume there people that no matter what are lazy or unworthy then you say `` if you are weak , you get eaten '' . 
  then you claim `` people adapts '' . 
  and my mum example was just wondering how such people would be able to change . 
   this is getting better every day . 
  yes , definitively . 
   congratulations on leaving out the relevant part . 
  sorry , and which was the relevant part ? 
  you mean the one on europe that i indeed linked ? 
   what obligations ? 
  like . . a common market means a common taxation ? 
  and `` we do n't tax your goods , you do n't ours '' ? 
  how in the hell are you pretending to quit europe ( and say no to duties ) and expect every right still to fiercely remain ? 
   feeding lazy mediterranean people down there ? 
  i 'd bail too . 
  ohh right . 
  it 's about southerns now . 
  like [ italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#eu-27_contributions_.282007-2013.29 ) was n't paying as much as uk . 
  like poland was n't the highest beneficiary ^ ^ guess [ ^ ^ who ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2948/britains-future.aspx ) ^ ^ wanted ^ ( ^ them ) . 
  like it was n't that every ** country ** has its lowest income places . 
  like , i mean , italy [ again ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/384tcj/regional_gdp_ppp_per_capita_in_the_eu_1027x1370/ ) itself . 
   btw . 
  the world is tough . 
  if you are weak , you get eaten . 
  mhh , yes , that must be what some adolf once said . 
  it does n't work like this in 21st century though . 
  i thought you mentioned democracy and peace and whatever before , right ? 
   the eu has maneuvered itself into a tough spot . 
  time to close in for the kill , i do n't see how that is a bad thing . 
  that 's what we are discussing . 
  do n't rush conclusions . 
   these cost significantly more money . 
  he said he 'd pay for his own primary and that 's it . 
  good bait nevertheless . 
  i 've seen it before . 
  o. . okay . 
  so is he being `` paid '' or not ? 
   if they could be making it , no . 
  oh right . 
  so . . your dream is . . be the new china ?
