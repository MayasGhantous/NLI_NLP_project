  do you even realize why factories have been moved there in the first place ? 
   the good news is , every machine needs people to monitor , service and clean it . 
  yes . 
  sure . 
  did you even stop a second to quantify this ? 
  or do you think 1 machine = =  1 man ? 
  like we were in xix century ? 
   there will always be work , what will go down are production cost of certain goods . 
  yes . 
  work . 
  do n't confuse it with jobs , that 's another concept . 
   people adapt . 
  i did n't think we were talking about biology now . 
  and i do n't fucking think like . . 95 % of people have even the brain to become an engineer in the first place . 
  i mean , i would n't see my mum with a phd in machine learning in this millennium . 
  what about yours ? 
   without capital , there will be no automation drive anytime soon . 
  capital is done with money . 
  which one earns by profiting over sales . 
  selling requires people , right . 
  and they would stop to buy once they have n't money , correct . 
  since money does n't literally burn though , guess where this goes in the end , if peasants have n't it ? 
  and guess who , at this point , would n't even care about selling , markets , or whatever , once you have milked the cow enough for your lifetime ? 
  yes , it 's not so simple of course , but here 's where i want you to explain how the system would magically fix . 
   guess who sits on the most cash right now ? 
  the entrepreneurs in shenzen who made screwdrivers for the plebs . 
  mhh , no . 
  my stats says big cash is in [ people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_world%27s_billionaires#2016 ) that profited from cheap shenzen enterprising by selling to rich westerns . 
  please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  then of course , it 's not like [ they ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_chinese_by_net_worth ) are poor either . 
  but : who gave them the money ? 
  definitively not me , directly . 
  so who ? 
   i 'm not blowing people on the street yet if it is what you mean . 
  you said it was always about competition on the lowest wage . 
  i said you omitted a big part the equation , namely expertise . 
  or in other words : be worth your higher wage . 
  now , please tell me again : why in the hell somebody in the us or uk would even want to make screwdrivers , when you probably could n't even pay get to eat there with so little money ? 
   that 's why you try to get a degree in the first place - to not live in the ghetto leftists dream of . 
  something i honestly do n't even know what the fuck we are talking about . 
   few are too stupid , most are too lazy . 
  and so your rhetoric about people adapting is bullshit . 
   trust me , busting your ass every day and having lazy ass social science people berating me about how paying their wages is great kills whatever socialism is transmittable by parents . 
  you have all my support . 
   subsidizing college cost , not lowering it . 
  whatever it is . 
  why university here is basically donated , while there people even dies of old age before repaying loans ? 
   start digging then . 
  you know , at least i 'm trying to make up some cool story . 
  i already found a couple of contradictions in yours instead . 
   glorious times i heard . 
  in a small market as it is , it makes some sense . 
  enter the eu during the migrant crisis , with no more important things to discuss , striking down any kind of net neutrality regulation . 
  i thought i mention this to show you what you actually support . 
  thank you for nothing . 
  wtf ? 
  i mean , you could me more clear next time . 
  when `` regulations '' does n't simply mean `` law '' but fucking '' [ international law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) '' . 
  what are we talking about ? 
   the reason why the mentioned regulations are bad is the following : they are completely arbitrary and set the wrong incentives . 
  how about some actual point ? 
  all law is arbitrary , if you want to go about the totally abstract way . 
  this seems arbitrary ** and ** [ make sense ] ( http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/wireless-net-neutrality-puts-verizon-and-rivals-on-equal-footing/ ) . 
   net neutrality favors utilities with large infrastructure over smaller ones so much that rural providers associations is [ in favor ] ( http://www.ntca.org/ceoblog/net-neutrality-looking-back-and-getting-ready-for-many-months-ahead/ ) . 
   eventually killing them and then requiring another regulation against monopolization , as an example . 
  oh , it 's funny you mentioned monopoly . 
  and tell me , are laws about monopolies good or bad ? 
  and i mean , a law is always good , regardless of the context , right ? 
   air pollution standards have been used by big , influential corporations to cull smaller businesses . 
  source ? 
   there is no scientific reason for the current ones in e.g. 
  cars either . 
  [ how ] ( http://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2016/02/more-aggressive-climate-policies-could-save-us-1-trillion-each-year/ ) [ about ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbon_price ) [ no ] ( http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2015/04/air-pollution-costs-european-economies-us$-1.6-trillion-a-year-in-diseases-and-deaths,-new-who-study-says ) ? 
   the less the better you 'll agree ? 
  i 'm glad i live on the right side of the fence now . 
  i dunno wherever you live , still you are really really constipated with references for your claims . 
   as soon as you stop false equivalencies . 
  not fair . 
  friendly remainder not to use anecdotes next time . 
   they also made all the manufacturing in the west disappear . 
  again : regulations or the expected wages ? 
  would you like to live in china now ? 
   burn the witch !, 
  also , if libertarian means compassion with wanting people to open a business and generate wealth , count me in . 
  objectively better than being a leech on others . 
  it did n't have any particular positive or negative connotation in my sentence . 
  especially knowing how the word is bendable . 
  and ditto for capitalism below , that i never addressed . 
  but fiy i think marxism sucks . 
  if you really want to know and stop altogether the reverse witch burning . 
   bin laden was known to be involved in the cole bombing . 
  clinton ignored the guy . 
  bush was no treat either , nobody is claiming otherwise . 
  really a reason to declare war to a whole country . 
  i mean , seriously ? 
  and , besides , you still have n't adressed me : who the fuck started the war then ? 
   giving these people the means to go out with a blast . 
  please , define means . 
   remember 2008 ? 
  or are you so rich it did not concern you ?
