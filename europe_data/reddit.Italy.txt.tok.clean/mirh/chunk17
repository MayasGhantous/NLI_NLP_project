  are you obliged to be so anal ? 
  and i think you genuinely skipped the section about deregulation just some line above . 
   who was drawing red lines again ? 
  obama , the democrat president . 
  the red lines for what ? 
  should i remember that in some cases they just [ attack ] ( http://time.com/3857121/isis-smuggling/ ) refugees to increase tension ? 
   wtf . 
  are you even serious ? 
  yes , i 'm serious . 
  check the [ dictionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corruption#english ) . 
  you literally corrupts something when you make it change . 
  if the change does n't even take place , for as much as you can be lax over terms , it is n't . 
  i think perhaps you are talking about bribing ? 
  which happens when the condition above is satisfied and you use money to obtain it . 
  and regardless , i 'm a passionate consequentialist . 
  and whatever the reason i first of all i check what 's the end result . 
  i 'm like 25000 + characters written . 
  still none about actual political ideas being senseful or not . 
   he could hire cheap illegal immigrants all the way and import cheap shit . 
  oh . . right . 
  because , you can * import * real estates . 
   he 'd have to break some serious laws if he was doing it for cash . 
  in ` murica it 's called lobbying , and last time i checked everybody seemed to think that 's the base of democracy . 
   like the clingons and their mail server yeah , that very server - everybody with no sysadmin knowledge talked about - that in the end saved them from some leaks . 
   he repeatedly said he bribed politicians when it suited him . 
  and so . . what about * your * double standard about bribing instead ? 
   all i wanted to show you is that the way op and you characterize your political opponents makes you look like elitist dicks . 
  in the meantime i always talked about your ideas , and never about you . 
  \\* tips \\* said this , i addressed all your concerns . 
  i ca n't say on the other hand the contrary happened . 
   they disagree with you on everything , so it 's back to `` who '' . 
  you can approximate as much as you want , but my function is still over ** what ** . 
   inside the us , there is indeed a free market because member states do n't pay for access to it . 
  [ ditto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internal_market#customs_duties_and_taxation ) . 
   as far as i understand there is no intention to raise walls . 
  well , that 's a bold claim . 
  so , basically , quitting europe just means `` fuck obligations , let 's just pretend all rights belong to us , and if somebody complains he 's the nazi '' ? 
   we only heard from the remainians here about how the eu will have to starve britain do death sorry , i do n't buy this false dilemma rhetoric . 
   forgetting that it has lost it 's status as prime export market and is projected to decline even further . 
  and ... this matters to our point benefits/duties in the sense that . . ? 
   consider me the first who does . 
  i consider to be darn happy , indeed . 
   interestingly , the commission can sponsor laws . 
  and interestingly , guess who elects [ it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_commission#appointment ) ? 
   totalitarianism , after all , is still a tool to exploit others . 
  what ? 
  it 's like saying cancer , after all , is still a tool that kills some cells . 
   almost every shitty occurrence save the middle eastern wars was a democrat fuckup . 
  bin laden how about less talking , more [ links ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_iraq#legality_of_invasion ) ? 
  what about [ bush ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraq_war#relation_to_the_global_war_on_terrorism ) being , you know , president and all ? 
   the crash the what ? 
   iran deal what the fuck is even wrong with this ?? 
   lybia ohhh , right . 
  totally not something proposed by [ uk itself ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1973 ) . 
  oh , and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_positions_of_donald_trump#libya ) . 
   syria , mass illegal immigration oh right , 100 % not something to do with not interventionism against isis . 
   spikes in crime ??? 
  world hunger perhaps too ? 
   also google elisabeth pocahontas warren . 
  she sums up almost everything wrong with democrats . 
  [ seems good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_positions_of_elizabeth_warren ) . 
   it 's called corruption and if it is okay where you live , it 's called corruption only when money interests makes you shift from your ideas . 
  and even if in trump 's case there 's no money shift , all his veery deep policies ideas seem completely unrelated to magnitude of his bank account ^ ^ / s also , pardon me : remember which party [ proposed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizen_equality_act_of_2017 ) [ reforms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_by_the_people_act ) to campaigns financing ? 
   please stop being so ethnocentric . 
  it 's racist . 
  stop being a dick with word meaning , thank you . 
   well this season ideas do matter . 
  no , they [ still do n't ] ( http://letsfreecongress.org/ ) . 
   that 's why trump is successful in the first place . 
  mhh , i think we have diverging ideas over the connotation of `` ideas '' . 
  i mean ** sound ** ideas . 
  world peace , self-interest ( aka nationalism ) , and more in general anything that does n't revolve around first order logic , is n't . 
   if it was about money , there would be jeb bush running against hillary clinton . 
  it 's about money you can spend on advertising . 
   sanders continued success against clingon perhaps you should n't get your news on stormfront , but clingon won like last week . 
   trump is not a corporation . 
  yes , [ he is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_trump_organization ) ? 
   he is a successful businessman and [ ... ] which is what i 'm saying is also driving his agenda . 
  it does n't make him more noble , and perhaps it would n't hurt if instead of all this ad hominem attacks you brought up , you know , actual political program . 
   and is paying for his own campaign . 
  he has no obligation to beg for cash . 
  oh , [ this ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/the-americans-trump-betrayed-by-courting-big-money-donors/482025/ ) btw . 
   let me explain to you a simple economic fact that drives poor people to anti-immigration parties : competition drives down their wages and quality of life . 
  let me explain a simpler economic fact : it 's called capitalism , and i 'm not the one that made up a whole country praising and boasting it . 
  also , this is even misleading , considering it 's not about wealth , but it 's about expertise . 
  engineers must begging for money on streets corners i suppose ? 
  oh , what do you say there ? 
  not everyone is an engineer ? 
  and please , tell me , why ? 
  and who 's pushing for lower college costs ? 
   the only ones benefiting are the upper middle class and the rich . 
  right right right , because of course lower class does n't benefit of cheap electronics produced in shenzen . 
  or screwdrivers , or whatever . 
  and because of course upper class must be really the one caring whether the hairdresser costs 10 $ or 60 $ . 
  and please , would you also explain to me in which way you are going to regulate automatization coming in the next decade ? 
  like big economic landscape reforms , or banning robots because feelings are hurt ? 
   excessive regulation may make sense if you are not affected by it . 
  oh , we have a libertarian here . 
  regulations make sense if they have sense , period . 
  there 's nothing subjective in law .
