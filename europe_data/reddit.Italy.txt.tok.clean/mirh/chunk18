  so , please again , tell me : in which way net neutrality regulations are bad ? 
  and i guess you are one of those claiming that with even less regulation , 2007 crisis would n't have happened , right ? 
  oh , and what about pollution effects ? 
  because you know , it 's not like air is n't public . 
  oh , or that trump instead thought the opposite . 
  ^ ^ / s  reading 120 laws for a glorified bake sale is a little much you 'll certainly agree . 
  people who want to open a bakery and make bread find this out the painful way . 
  yes , yes , yes . 
  every country has these stories . 
  i wonder how the grass can always be greener on the other side of . . * every * fence ? 
   this is where you get the `` stupid '' eurosceptics . 
  100 % european union has something to do with bakeries . 
  k.  when you keep hearing about such examples , you might start to think that there is some kind of connection . 
  for the moments , the only complaints i hear , is indeed plebs on tv that speak with no actual clue of what they are talking about . 
   that says more about you than anybody else is my point . 
  the warning was too late . 
  if you repeat a lie often enough , it becomes the truth . 
  right ? 
   weapons are goods . 
  analogy stands . 
  weapons in you analogy stands for * problems * . 
  same for shitty ideas . 
   remember mercantilist france before the revolution ? 
  nope , and i 'd like to remember you world has changed in the last couple of centuries and half . 
   also , are you implying people who do not agree with you are stupid per definition ? 
  nope . 
  the determinant is what , not who . 
   single market ! = free market . 
  you said above not even the us are free [ and libertarian i guess ? ], 
  enough by your standards . 
  so , i wonder if you are n't just complaining world is n't what jhon locke was dreaming . 
   also , protectionism towards non europeans is a thing . 
  see , not so clever anymore . 
  oh right , eu is famous for being some medieval commune . 
  i guess even all those attempts to lower duties with ukraine , or russia , or us or whatever was just red herring . 
  definitively nothing that had to do with the past , more than with actual people desire . 
  and please , could you explain in which way uk would become less `` protectionist '' by raising other walls ? 
   as an exercise , find , in your opinions , better arguments for what `` they '' want . 
  i find 100 % of people that want uk out do n't even know that meps are democratically elected and all . 
  i find 100 % of people that want uk out do n't even know that `` council of ministers '' is n't some sectarian reunion in the basements of bruxelles with freemasons and satan , but the very ministers that all the eu citizens have appointed by themselves for their countries . 
  i also find 100 % of people praising trump claiming he 's `` different '' just because he 's , you know , `` new '' . 
  failing to remember * who * have been toxic members of the government and which not . 
  forgetting * who * has always put those people in power in the first place . 
  failing to recognize what have been actual negligence or malice and what instead a genuine sharable mistake . 
  we might even discuss all day whether clinton is in the hands of big corporations that pay her campaign . 
  and this is fine after all : the end justifies the means and it 's marketing , not ideas , what in the end makes you win . 
  trump ** is ** the corporations on the other hand . 
  and the only things that seem to conceal this evident fact , are . . his promises . 
  you can even have just two turkeys , and he will promise * three * apiece . 
  and people buys it !, 
  because there 's no such thing as `` wrong '' . 
  everything is an opinion !, 
  economy ? 
  finance ? 
  climate ? 
  physics ? 
  fuck em , unless it 's history anything can still be . 
  and i find this behaviour quite childish . 
  be it `` make america great '' again ( has america ever lost that status ? ), 
  or be it `` foreigners fucks [ us ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ocej2/britain_first_just_used_a_picture_of_czech_wwii/ ) '' . 
   free movement of weapons and shitty ideas . 
  mhh interesting . 
  so the eu would be free movement of weapons ? 
  really clever similarity . 
   same goes for the rest of it . 
  oh right . 
  anybody said . . single market ? 
   not true either . 
  trump appeals to the white lower class in america which is more conservative . 
  brexit voters are coming from both left and right . 
  see it as an intelligence divide , rather than class . 
  simpler , is n't it ? 
   it was however an association of states with similar regulation and foreign policy , even a common market mhh [ no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_international ) ? 
  it was an association of parties , and none of them was legally connected to the other . 
  unless you are talking of the `` soviet union dictatorship '' stage , where i totally do n't even see this . 
   why you are throwing two distinct protest movements together which advocate for quite the opposite ? 
  because they appeal the same animal instinct to find scapegoats . 
  this . 
  also , let 's not forget for obscure reasons , australian government can fine and imprison everybody that `` talks '' about it . 
  because people complain when money goes out of the country ? 
  indeed they did with turkey agreement . 
  it 's not like they are n't complaining of the opposite too then . 
  because they send said boats in papua , which accept them under a huge payment . 
  there 's no magic involved . 
  all developed countries already exploited the shit out their mountains . 
  if it made economical sense , it has already been built . 
   sure this is not the end of reaching a fully renewable energy supply but one big milestone on the way . 
  i 'd swear norway does this on a monthly ( if not weekly ) basis . 
  though it 's not eu . 
  and i honestly do n't see why that should change anything . 
  it 's not like on the other hand land is something that does n't require constant care with fertilizers , herbicides and all . 
  you see , the problem basically arises from putting expectations of an objective before its premises in the first place . 
  the result is wishful thinking . 
  but let 's discuss with order . 
  first , when doing ** apples to apples ** comparisons a couple of iea projections are totally [ ok-ish ] ( https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/technologyroadmapsolarphotovoltaicenergy_2014edition.pdf#25 ) ( ca n't speak for others since numbers do n't [ compute ] ( https://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wec_j1143_costoftechnologies_021013_web_final.pdf#page=12 ) with [ source ] ( http://www.seia.org/research-resources/bnef-new-energy-outlook-2015 ) ) second , we have `` mixed data '' issues . 
  somewhere they talk of ghg-free , somewhere else they write of `` fossil-free '' , in other news they say `` renewable '' , here and there they refers to `` solar and wind '' , full stop . 
  it 's no big magic to speak towards a nuclear for baseload , hydro for storage and wind-solar for remainder grid , a bit more instead if we start to pretend exceeding 2 \u00b0 c scenario damages costs with grid costs is also going to square the circle . 
  third ( not very important but still ) i saw they are using quite outdated ( or biased , in their tone ) sources , like when [ referring ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2015/05/01/why-teslas-powerwall-is-just-another-toy-for-rich-green-people/ ) to [ batteries ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-06/tesla-s-new-battery-doesn-t-work-that-well-with-solar ) . 
  last but *** most *** they are full of shit and do n't even check/mention their sources . 
  they bring up 3 cents / kwh in dubai , falling to notice that 's [ not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_power_in_the_united_arab_emirates#dubai ) unsubsidized ( and no acknowledgment for `` their special climate '' either ) .
