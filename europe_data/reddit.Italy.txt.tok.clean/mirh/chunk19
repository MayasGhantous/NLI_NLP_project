  then they fail to notice [ moroccan ] ( http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/new-low-for-wind-energy-costs-morocco-tender-averages-us30mwh-81108 ) and [ mexican ] ( http://cleantechnica.com/2016/04/06/mexicos-awards-enel-green-power-nearly-1-gw-sunpower-approximately-500-mw-solar/ ) examples are also all [ but ] ( http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/mexico-awards-more-than-1-gw-of-solar-at-us4050-mwh_100023944/ ) `` free market '' ( besides , i fail to see what wind power achievements have to do with solar 's ) . 
  if you notice some hatred , yes i have . 
  i need 20 seconds to blast your usual koch brothers argument . 
  on the other hand i need a full hour to debunk all this hippies bullshit that require a bit of thermodynamical and engineering considerations . 
  and at the end of the day truth , and the research of the best solution , is harmed more by well crafted narratives rather than 3rd graders i-cant-hear-you denying . 
  it 's not only a scam ( economically i mean ) . 
  it 's an energy hog . 
  you almost spent more fuel at farming then that you then recover . 
  could you have some link for these bad forecasts ? 
  because in my experience gp has always been a bs champion , and i fear you are confusing `` 4 days in portugal '' with `` all year in the world '', 
  sorry , i guess i must be misunderstanding the meaning of `` europ\u00e6iske union '' then [ . 
   watered down versions watered down versions , ok . and aside of opt outs that just marginally touched this , which of the many political rights and duties common among eu members were affected ? 
   denmark agreed to watered down versions of them with a lot of opt-outs . 
  watered down version with a lot of opt-outs , which still are n't enough not to declare them * political * . 
   we 've voted no to every major thing since we joined the eec . 
  what did people do on 18 may 1993 and 28 may 1998 then ? 
  and what did government vote on 24 april 2008 ? 
   stop sending me links to shit that 's not even related to what we are talking about . 
  world is one , remember . 
   you 're not informing anyone . 
  of course i ca n't inform anyone if their ears are shut . 
  still , i see somebody is n't even acknowledging denmark agreed to amsterdam and lisbon treaties . 
   and all sorts of other things . 
  not according to my sources . 
   you just wrote a bunch of nonsense . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/physicalism ) you [ are ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral_universalism ) . 
  so . . you wonder we are n't even talking of the same thing ? 
  good luck informing you . 
   yes it does . 
  [ no it 's a tie . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum )  the leave campaign is ahead in poles . 
  which even assuming it was , it 's really not the same of saying `` the whole personified uk rose and shone totally against the eu ''  yes , we did vote for the lisbon treaty and it was rejected . 
  you damn rejected [ conversion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_european_union_opt-out_referendum,_2015 ) of opt-out to opt-in . 
  the treaty itself was ratified by [ parliament ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7138138.stm ) in [ 2008 ] ( https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/r0710.aspx?id=116752 ) . 
   that is why denmark has opt-outs . 
  [ opt-outs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union ) are over euro , armed forces and in a quite unorthodox manner schengen . 
  for the remainder there 's no difference from germany or spain . 
   do you even try to make sense or are you just talking out of your ass ? 
  listen , i 'm just telling you how a physicalist and morally universalist world works . 
  are we thinking to two different things ? 
  we discuss our initial hypothesis . 
  still problematic ? 
  we discuss our very goals . 
  still problematic ? 
  we discuss why we have those goals . 
  reiterate . 
   i know . 
  eec was a economic union and that was what we joined . 
  not a political union . 
  did you even check links ? 
   what 's false ? 
  that it was just economical . 
  are you using a browser that sanitizes links perhaps ? 
  because i 'd swear there were some there . 
   that the uk feels that they have been tricked into a union which they do n't want to be a part of ? 
  that was n't what we were discussing about , and it really do n't seem to reflect actual pools . 
   sure there is . 
  we still want out though . 
  we do n't want to be part of a political union . 
  did you vote or did you not vote for treaty of amsterdam and lisbon [ ? 
  ] ( https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/r0710.aspx?id=116752 )  its fine you love the eu - i do n't and many others do n't either . 
  yes , and what i 'm trying to tell you since 5 posts is that either we are talking of a different reality or we just have to settle down our `` different data '' . 
   the dublin agreement requires them to be registered . 
  i guess i was n't clear enough . 
  i was saying that you can still be entitled , registered , and granted asylum , and yet decide to wander for whatever reason . 
  of course this can also apply to somebody that did n't meet the previous conditions . 
   legitimate refugees do n't hound truck drivers all day long , trying to stow away in trailers when they 're already in a safe country . 
  well , these are just your 2c . 
  legitimate refugees in your point , would n't also be sent to a favela . 
   now you 're just inventing flimsy excuses for their inexcusable behaviour . 
  no , i 'm just trying to find a source that asks them what they have their mind about in the first place . 
  too easy to lay the blame on them being animals otherwise . 
   seeking asylum is not a vacation , you do n't get to cherry pick your destination . 
  they 're in france , they must register in france . 
   failing that , deport the lot of them . 
  this is where also international ( or eu ? ), 
  law plays a big role . 
  if we take for granted they are legit refugees , then this mean the only country on earth that you could legally deport them is . . well , the same country they were fleeing in the first place . 
  if you merge this with the initial premise that had justified the asylum in the first place , this technically means you are * condemning * them . 
  i ca n't say i find this cool but if i quit experimental thoughts and think to a real person psyche , i see there 's a lot of room for `` misunderstandings '' if i can explain . 
   they 're choosing to live in squalor instead of seeking help from the french government , i have no pity for them . 
  i tried to find more about . 
  for as much as [ calais camp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calais_jungle ) [ illegally ] existed somehow since 1999 , [ at least part of ] the last one causes could be attributed to a [ day center ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migrants_around_calais#jules_ferry_day_centre_and_.e2.80.98new_jungle.e2.80.99_camp_.282015.29 ) opened a year ago over there . 
  then i staggered when i read [ 2000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel#asylum_and_immigration ) people tried to walk across the eurotunnel over a single night ( which for as much as a single event , it 's still crazy ) . 
  then after [ some ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21660581-camp-channels-edge-sideshow-europes-migrant-crisis-it-offers-important ) [ links ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27545079 ) i now start to wonder what the hell [ at least some of ] these people are expecting . 
   being relocated to a camp setup to house them during the conflict is in no way comparable to living under isil 's rule . 
  mhh , i was referring to the actual `` central territory '' , not conflicted borders . 
  if you are muslim , i 'm not seeing all that difference in * expected conditions * . 
   yes , which is why i said it would be necessary to have a good control over our external borders for this to work . 
  it 's a quite ambiguous claim though . 
  i mean , it 's not like canada has all that * control * . 
  it 's just nobody even try . 
   no , it 's a pragmatic stance on the way that their backwards culture works . 
  they treat women like shit , therefore women and children must be given priority . 
  i think you are confusing isis ( or as i previously said uae , sa ) with your average muslim . 
  for as much as your average woman is n't a pussy riot , i would n't say their conditions is that far from western women just half a century ago . 
   case in point : new year 's eve all over germany . 
  they view women as inferior . 
  oh , god . . 
  i think we should first settle down on the relevance of this * proof * before proceeding . . for as much as i 'm all but saying this is insignificant , how can you even correlate this to a population ?
