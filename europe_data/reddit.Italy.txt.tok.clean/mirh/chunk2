  which is why quotas exists in the first place . 
  you take down southern countries with all these people state has to look after . 
  if you spread them between all the member countries impact on economy is way more soft ... 
  even though you should take into account that it 's not like the 40 $ per day collectivity has to pay for a single refugee ... are n't give to other members of said collectivity . 
  so , while we are at it , let 's just tell them they can decide their own economic , political and social agenda as they wish . 
   all of them all representative democracies yes . 
  and i 'm saying that you have no `` good representation '' by counting the vote of an estonian citizen more than a france citizen . 
  also , i 'd like to underline again : vote depends upon social class , jobs , education and geographical residence . 
  there 's no all-germans-will-unite-to-fuck-others conspiracy . 
  i mean , i have never seen the majority of germans voting for a single party . 
  if it was a refugee from country x , it 's not like then he can lie , saying he came from country y. 
  well , tbh n9 was a kind of prototype . 
  i mean , it had more or less the same austerity you can find in nexus phone . 
  still , i know you could do a lot of things with that . 
  and it would have been way more farsighted to just improve on that , rather than trying to reinvent the wheel again with bloody wp, 
  fixing their countries , is definitively the right solution . 
  the problem is that it 's going to take a lot of time unless libya recognized state tell us we can help them , or un say we are authorized to trespass their borders . 
  and in the meantime people will continue to complain and complain, 
  oh , right . 
  no ethnicities came here in the last . . 2 thousands years . 
  roman empire fell by itself . 
  it 's not easy for you to fix problems in other countries when [ those ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2015/02/libya-foreign-minister-weapons-army-intervention.html ) do n't like you , and when [ others ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39pknm/spiegel_russian_veto_threatens_eu_mission_against/ ) try to fuck you as much as they can, 
  fiy the whole goddamn europe is a melting pot, 
  so , tell us this magic solution . 
  and please , remember `` securing borders '' is bs , because you do n't say `` fuck off '' to refugees . 
  better for you if you do n't look at south korea then, 
  do you know what n9 was ? 
  do you know it 's still ok for today standards and that , for no goddamn reason , the allmighty administration ( and ceo ) decided not to sell it ... in europe ? 
  because you know , what better place to show how appreciated is a new phone than those market where the whole brand is also new . 
  do n't know in your country , but in mine you can send them back from wherever they come from . 
  what the ? 
  are you living in the middle ages ? 
  you do n't just pretend they do n't exist . 
  and now you will tell me gerrymandering is fine ... 
  you can reject snowden by pretending us law is perfect and it 's just a normal criminal . 
  but war in middle east is something you ca n't workaround with lexical quibbles . 
  i 'm saying the only way to reject a refugee is rejecting every one and rejecting [ treaties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee#international_attitude ), 
  you seem to miss the point . 
  it 's not the opinion of * countries * which matters . 
  it 's the opinion of * people * . 
  otherwise you are just going to have a [ crappy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rgx91rq5i ) voting system like that used in the uk . 
  that 's how the legal framework works . 
  without refugee visa they are just like every other irregular migrant , and it 's not like you 'd find somebody that likes them . 
  you seem to miss the fact that we are not accepting them because they are just `` poorer '' . 
  it 's because religion , war and shit like that . 
  then , eu is actually trying to do something , but you see , russia fucks everything . 
  imo , this a reason to stay even more united . 
  you have no legal way to say no to people like a normal syrian , and yes to another like , say , snowden . 
   this is a union of the european people . 
  european heritage , european children , the well-being of all europe . 
  please , stop nationalistic bs . 
  our glorious culture , if you really want to call it like this ( it 's ours , best !! ), 
  is also based on christian values , which means welcome wretched . 
  would you want to disrespect it ? 
  jokes aside , refugees are fucking [ under international treaties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee#international_attitude ) . 
  as i said , you do n't just shut the door . 
  furthermore , even though i really do n't like throwing shit at france , italy , germany and us for libyan intervention ( i mean , there 's nothing like a good dictator ) , it 's not like in an ideal world we should n't even had assured everything was going well . 
  ... or unless shit is fixed there , you know . 
  then refugees are not longer refugees and they can return to their countries . 
  you do n't enforce borders with refugees christ . 
  you are obliged to check for them . 
  the only way to solve this problem is fixing the shit there . 
   try to tell sovereign nation that his view does n't matter and his vote does n't matter . 
  you seem to imply votes are distributed following a country based pattern . 
  actually , culture/views of people change according to their geographical `` region '' . 
  which is something like san marino with italy or belgium-netherlands with either france or german . 
  i never heard of clashes between people there, 
  wtf ? 
  since dawn of time it has always been like this . 
  and it 's not like this is n't even how democracy or a family work . 
  you try to agree and you what the majority choose . 
  you seem to imply southern nation give no damns of the problem because well , they can always send refugees to finland . 
  you serious ? 
  the problem is rather hard to fix , and quotas are a nice common method to relieve the most affected countries . 
  you can fix the reason for them to be refugees ( which is quite difficult , thanks to [ russia ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39pknm/spiegel_russian_veto_threatens_eu_mission_against/ ) ) but borders are a thing only if we are talking of irregular migrants . 
  afaik left has always been more about internationalism , whilst nationalism was more of a right point . 
  a right wing eu is going to dissolve by definition . 
  oh , tiny regions have less power ? 
  in what weird world are we living ? 
   it is eu problem because today ukraine , next time belarus and few other smaller nations refuges are also a common problem because you know , first you take down italian economy , than spanish one , then they freely travel to france and so on and so forth, 
   refugess are not responsibility refuges are a responsibility . 
  you ca n't tell them to fuck off , because treats and conventions ( which are in turn based on ethic standard i guess ) . 
  the contrary also did n't help for stability . 
  just to show you popular approval does n't imply anything . 
  on another news people in russia are happier than ever with current ~ ~ dic ~ ~ free government . 
  still economy is at its worse crisis since the 90s . 
   recent study in holland showed that more than 60 % do n't have faith in the eu oh , that 's really a serious economical indicator, 
  what the hell is this ? 
  child skirmish ? 
  yes , but i do n't think being inept as in hollande could cause the same kind of anger we were talking about . 
  i mean , the rage you have when you read of abbot, 
  oh right , i forgot about that big thing . 
  it 's pretty nice then . 
  yes , in absolute terms it 's really a big amount of money , but i was saying : if in 5 years this ratio can almost double , 1 % in 4 years seems a very tiny improvement in comparison . 
   will fall to 104 percent in 2018 from 105 percent in 2014 is this really a lot ? 
  something that really impressed me is also [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/starve_the_beast ) had it really a big impact ? 
  yes sure . 
  but i guess in the long run it 's shit if with every cyclic crisis you raise debt/gdp ratio further and further . 
  i mean . . 
  i hope it 'll start to decrease soon,
