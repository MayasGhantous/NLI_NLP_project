  i already had some discussion [ about ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/3zpv0w/ritenete_che_quanto_successo_a_colonia_a_san/cypkcbs ) ^ ^ sorry , ^ ^ italian but any kind of introducing statistics ended in various conspiracies . 
  [ these ] ( http://www.vice.com/de/read/die-rape-culture-wurde-nicht-nach-deutschland-importiert-sie-war-schon-immer-da-aufschrei-118 ) might [ help ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/07/10/most-muslims-want-democracy-personal-freedoms-and-islam-in-political-life/ ) contextualizing . 
   did you miss the part where the policy includes family units ? 
  no need for single men to travel alone to bring their families later . 
  yes , i miss the part where traveling becomes like a `` joke '' . 
  canada can even permit this luxury , but how could this apply here ? 
   diversity and having different opinions mean ... that you are thinking to different things . 
  now if this is about different `` inputs '' , different `` data '' , some concrete fact like i dunno , sandy seabed vs rocky one , it can be civilly discussed and accounted for . 
  and i do n't see where 's the `` omg it 's impossible to agree '' part . 
  the only way i see there could be a problem is , as i said , if you assume goals of a swede put his person on a different level than a portuguese . 
  once you rule out there 's no kind of `` culture '' bullshit that can not be worked around . 
   a does not imply b !, 
  we agreed to a economic community there 's no [ eec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_community ) anymore . 
  it 's just eu . 
  that 's what i was trying to say . 
   not a political . 
  which albeit unrelated to the previous point is false . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_maastricht_treaty_referendum,_1993 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_amsterdam_treaty_referendum,_1998 not to mention all the others treaties probably ratified by local parliament . 
   that is the exact same thing with the uk [ also ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amsterdam_treaty#signatures ) [ false ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/signing_of_the_treaty_of_lisbon#list_of_signatories ) . 
   our country be run by brussels . 
  ohh , right . 
  because banks , reptilians , lobbies , jews are brussels . 
  there 's no kind of voting system and all behind ^ / s, 
   i do n't see anything in that article that claims that europeans are screaming `` noooooo '' . 
  oh , sorry , i had misunderstood . 
  the link below talking of poland could be a good one for this then . 
  and i 'm having a quite doomed discussion with one of those europeans [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4j1q0o/kevin_kallaughers_cartoon_from_last_weeks_edition/d33umkl ) btw . 
   this is n't the attitude of refugees just seeking safety here , they are migrants who want to settle in a specific country and are abusing the asylum system in an attempt to bypass immigration laws . 
  in which case they are expelled . 
  i 'm totally fine with this . 
   those not eligible for asylum are to be deported . 
  [ they ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics#decisions_on_asylum_applications ) [ are ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/statistics_on_enforcement_of_immigration_legislation ) . 
  and `` illegally marching '' is n't technically incompatible with one that received asylum 's rights . 
  international law requires them to file for asylum in the first safe country they reach . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/sep/21/claim-asylum-uk-legal-position there 's [ no ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/3ae68ccec.html ) mention to the `` first '' bit . 
  perhaps you are confusing with the eu policy about identification ? 
   i see you very conveniently side-stepped when i pointed out the situation in calais . 
  aside of convenience , i 'm not sure how that 's relevant at all . 
  [ afaik ] ( https://www.amnesty.org.uk/truth-about-refugees ) anyway , these are legit refugees . 
   what on earth are they doing trying to force their way into the uk illegally ? 
  those in the calais camp who refuse to seek asylum in france should be rounded up and deported immediately . 
  [ some ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/06/worlddispatch.jonhenley ) [ ideas ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/migrants-sew-their-lips-shut-in-protest-at-calais-jungle-demolition ) . 
  tl ; dr it was n't really about `` refusing to seek in france '' . 
  it was more about that being a shithole and uk being so near . 
   do n't worry , at the rate they 're arriving here in europe we 'll reach those numbers soon . 
  the rate they are arriving in europe is proportional to the rate they are also fleeing there . 
   what was it last year ? 
  in germany alone it was 1.1 million , not counting the rest of the eu and migrants who never registered because our external borders are so damn porous it was 1.2 in the [ whole eu ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-press-releases/-/3-04032016-ap ) man . 
  and why in the world are you linking me an article behind a paywall ? 
  i mean , it 's not like it 's going to be of any use . 
   i 'd love to see your vigor in counting how many were taken in by the other arab nations who definitely have the resources to do so ( saudi , uae ) . 
  living there or under isil reign is not very different . 
  i think you are forgetting how wealth is `` redistributed '' in those countries . 
   of people criticizing it . 
  either way they obviously do n't hold enough sway to keep it from happening . 
  and for the record , i 'm in favour of the agreement . 
  i 'm totally , but even though the agreement will ultimately comes into place ( hopefully ? 
  ) , you see this is the kind of people that spoils europe . 
  and 90 % are n't even inside eu . 
  they sit in local parliaments . 
   only take family units , women and children directly from the refugee camps in the me . 
  quite easy when you confine with north pole and greenland , is n't it ? 
   no single men . 
  and for as much as i 'm totally against morons and against-white-men conspiracies , i ca n't avoid to stop thinking this is quite hate against y chromosome . 
  i 'd also like to remember you that usually , it works like : men goes there = =  ask for asylum and live kind of hardship = =  asylum is granted = =  family arrives, 
   you have probably heard this before , but you 're a special kind of stupid if that is `` logical '' to you . 
  ok , let 's break this down . 
  let 's imagine there 's a law . 
  it is gon na apply to the whole eu . 
  let 's say this is about environment and fishing practices . 
  sweden likes it , ireland does not . 
  now , we can imagine the state that ** does n't ** like it ( approval confuses too much with consensus ) thinks the law is ** too ** < something  . 
  we may say irishmen wants * something else * as well . 
  for example , using a type of net . 
  if we assume both nations have the same goal ( because they have , right ? 
  welfare , long term health and all ? ), 
  and if we assume as i was previously saying somebody is n't thinking to be more * entitled * than others to * have benefits * and brings in subjective criterias like we  you ... what 's the matter then ? 
  it 's just about truth , which is one . 
   yes , but if it has nothing to do with the discussion , they 're not relevant to mention . 
  my first [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4j1q0o/kevin_kallaughers_cartoon_from_last_weeks_edition/d33umkl ) ? 
   yes , we agreed to join the european economic community . 
  not the european union , which we have rejected several times . 
  [ except ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_community ) a implies b. 
   learn how to read , then you 'll understand it . 
  learn to write beforehand !, 
  '' [ ... ] about referendums that rejected referendums '' ? 
   well , for instance , they 're trying to force refugee quotas again again again . 
  yes , and this breaks down to what i said earlier . 
  are they right or wrong ? 
  if your critics is on the `` methods '' , on the other hand instead , what i 'm seeing is that you are winning this battle . 
   of course it does n't mean that one countries citizens are more worth than another , just because they want something else . 
  no , that 's exactly the logical implication . 
  you either accept that between two different opinions at least one must be wrong , or `` the will of danish people '' must be incommensurable with that of other men . 
   coming from an italian , i might understand that . 
  at least previous governments , current one is n't that bad . 
  aside of that ( i 'm not really into german or french politics i mean ) i also made poland example . 
  yes , eu wants , eu wants . 
  but i 'll buy that at any time over bigots views . 
   then why are you trying to pull them into the discussion ? 
  because you asked me who i was talking about when i said `` blaming them '' ?
