   the first one was us joining the eu , as i wrote . 
  so , you agreed to do something , right ? 
   3 of them was about referendums that was rejected in referendums . 
  what ? 
   the 2 others were what passed after the previous proposals had been rejected - severely watered down . 
  so you did agree to do something part 2 . 
   the 3 largest referendums we have had since we joined the eu : the maastricht treaty , $ uro and danish european union opt-out referendums were all rejected , as the links you provided points out . 
  ok . and you also rejected refugee plan iirc . 
  so , what in the hell are you talking about you are being forced to do ? 
   yes , individual member states want different things . 
  except it should n't . 
  unless you are saying that a danish citizen is more or less worth than a frenchman i mean . 
   but because we ca n't do all the things , someone will always get the shaft . 
  for the moment , i always found eu-wide decisions tens of times more sane than local government one . 
  my guess is that exactly in light of diversity , final compromise is better than everything else . 
   what are you even talking about ? 
  when did i blame poland or italy . 
  i 'm talking of a couple of states that are or has been under eu observation for problems . 
  nothing to do with you . 
   the eu is trying to force its will on member states you are talking as if eu was some ethereal monster . 
  well , surprise everything is directly or indirectly voted by people . 
   denmark has voted no to everything about the eu ever since we agreed to enter a economic union . 
  we voted no the the $ uro , we voted no to the lisbon treaty , we voted no to further eu integration , but still they 're trying to force us . 
  well , another surprise , you [ voted ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1972 ) [ for ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_single_european_act_referendum,_1986 ) [ it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_maastricht_treaty_referendum,_1992 ) , [ plenty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_maastricht_treaty_referendum,_1993 ) [ of ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_amsterdam_treaty_referendum,_1998 ) [ times ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_european_union_opt-out_referendum,_2015 ) . 
  i 'm quite unsure now of what `` force '' mean in your dictionary . 
   that 's not a symptom or whatever you 're talking about . 
  that is the eu who does n't give a fuck what its members actually want . 
  meanwhile you keep making referendums and they get honored .

  what do you mean ? 
   asylum should not be processed for people who march all the way across europe illegally while passing multiple safe countries on the way . 
  such is international law . 
  and just to give a context , [ it 's not like ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war ) turkey has n't already almost 3 million refugees , or jordan and lebanon a million ( or egypt [ 250000 ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e486356.html ) or tunisia [ at least 300000 ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/10/tunisia-refugee-crisis-policy-law.html ) ) .

  i would also . 
  but can you see how anything over than little sanctions is going to make `` some people '' really angry ? 
  i mean , the same people that already piss over integration . 
  ^ ^ eu ^ ^ state ^ ^ integration  [ citation needed ] i 'm not really sure on whether you want a citation for the [ agreement ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-16-963_it.htm ) or for people criticizing it . 
  in all fairness , i would n't know what 's the overall stance over europe , but at least in italy i saw a lot of backfire ( again , from those same parties that would have condemned the eu regardless ) . 
  though i 'm not sure you would be interested to this `` local '' stuff . 
   exactly . 
  and that is why its best for the eu to end . 
  so it 's state 's problem ( and eu just make these evident ) and it would be its fault ? 
  cmon . 
   instead of blaming who ? 
  blaming the moronic governors some state have . 
  today is poland 's turn , yesterday it was italy 's , tomorrow who knows . 
   i blame the eu for trying to further integrate . 
  blame the symptom , not the cause , right . 
  a little example of what you are talking about ^ ^ ^ [ credits ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/445v58/european_union_support_for_eu_falls_among_scots/cznvc48 ) : eu : we should create a relocation program to release pressure from greece , italy and hungary . 
  people : nooooooo -- eu : frontex should be able to enforce eu borders against the will of a member state people : nooooooo -- eu : we can reduce the influx of asylum seekers if we cooperate closer with turkey people : nooooooo -- people : eu ca n't deal with the crisis !!, 
  ! 1111 they should just stop the influx !!, 
  in the end you are n't doing anything more than tarring everything with the same brush . 
   you assume that the entire of nationalism is that it creates a negative perception of others . 
  i would say inferior , rather than negative . 
  and i kind of think it 's the superior attitude in the first place that leads you to nationalism , but i guess i 'm divagating into psychology and anecdotes here . 
   my argument is that the overwhelming majority of its reality is a creation of positive feelings towards duties and obligations towards others helping to secure and justify the acquisition of collective goods not accessible through individual action alone . 
  that 's the basis for a society , yes , i would agree too . 
   the good should not be ignored because it can be utilised for bad , as that is the case with everything in politics . 
  except we are n't talking of guns , or smartphones or alcohol . 
  we are talking of an idea . 
  it either maximizes the attainment of a goal ( whatever we could agree this is and for as much as we know ) or it does n't , in which case i would n't think to a better alternative rather than promoting it . 
  even `` juche '' ideology is `` not even bad '' if i can explain . 
   every ideology that has been tried has a litany of failed case studies . 
  i also agree here , but . . 
  i mean , is n't by exactly studying corner/failed cases that man has always improved ? 
  pretending they are forgettable issues is pretty blind imo . 
   if you want to see the problems that result from a lack of nationalism , look at the litany of failed democracies in africa where rather than any sense of the national self politics has devolved back into ethnicism , tribalism and despotism . 
  that 's just the very principles of nationalism on a smaller scale , and i do n't see why they would be lacking that , instead of complexity into state organization . 
  i think parochialism is the word we use here translated into english . 
   i also reject your idea that politics is only made up of people discussing the objective truth in a manner that is convincing to the political elite . 
  i never referred to the idea of what is , but rather to what should . 
  and i never mentioned * elites * . 
  there 's no intelligentsia-retarded dichotomy . 
   attempting to explain confusing and difficult concepts in simple terms that are accessible to a wide range of different audiences , particularly the less well educated and disenfranchised , is a good rather than a bad thing see this is also true with anything , be it physics or biology . 
  but i never talked about * simplicity * . 
  i was referring to ** truthiness ** . 
   particularly with nationalism as it can be justified on a number of different intellectual levels . 
  i disagree on the use of `` particularly '' but i 'm eager to hear some . 
  or worded differently : there are some people that run states that think to better than others , and unfortunately this does n't work well whenever you have to confront with others . 
  instead of blaming them ( perhaps your state is one of those ? 
  ) , i 'll assume eu politicians are n't representing anybody ( as if they had n't been voted ) and i 'll call for buzzwords . 
   nationalism includes a wider range of civic and ethnic arguments on an exceptionally wide range of different issues , including whether people have moral and societal obligations to their compatriots , what interactions and obligations they have to a state or its people , and how and why they should interact with democratic systems whose citizenry , in theory , drive the popular sovereignty of the state in question . 
  yes , this would make sense if we assumed everybody is living in a different reality . 
  in such a world consensus would n't exist because i do n't think objectivity could even be conceivable considering everything is a function of your house position . 
  thanks god that 's just a philosopher nightmare . 
   it generally provides much greater common day to day goods in a format that lots of people instinctively understand in a more effective way without having to read a whole bunch of books that will elevate them to the elites on your intellectual plane . 
  then you 'll agree there 's no more common idea than truth . 
   even if you do n't particularly like it , you should be aware that a large amount of political discourse you like is almost certainly justified to the electorate on some level through nationalist terms , which means : people are stupid . 
  instead of promoting genuine and right ideals , let 's keep telling them the problem must always reside in others . 
   if we accept nations are hotbeds of racial and ethnic tension , nationalism is often an exceptionally effective way of curtailing them by promoting an alternate identity more accessible based on nationality rather than ethnicity , well , except we do n't accept . 
  you cure the root cause ( which is people thinking to be * more entitled * than others just because they ** are ** ) , you do n't take placebo pills . 
   indeed the idea of nation building is often a fundamental part of helping fragile states with ethnic tensions become more peaceful and stable . 
  oh yes , tell me how good this worked in india and pakistan . 
  or yugoslavia . 
  or israel . 
   as hydro stands for 95 % of norways electricity production and 50 % of swedens i would say that there is production at all time . 
  yes , but exactly since they have to power those countries i was telling you that the actual available `` battery '' is just the nowadays unused potential . 
   as for offsetting of base load , sweden and norway is together aiming for 26twh/yr in new renewable production before 2020 with the current subsidy scheme and it seems to be working as in sweden currently ~ 500mw of wind power is built every year . 
  this would actually kind of lessen my previous incertitude .
