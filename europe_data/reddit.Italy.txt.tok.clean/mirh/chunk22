  but we are back to the root problem then . 
   the point is that we have a battery corresponding to something like 3100 / 80 \u2243 9days of the european grids average operation ? 
  80 twh may even be the potentially reservable * energy * in norway . 
  the maximum * power * available , on the other hand is a totally different matter . 
  we are far from 370 gw from your calculous . 
  we are talking of a quite more shy [ 31 gw ] ( https://www.nve.no/energiforsyning-og-konsesjon/vannkraft/vannkraftpotensialet/ ) and that , contrarily to what i said earlier is n't going [ any far ] ( https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/fd89d9e2c39a4ac2b9c9a95bf156089a/facts_2015_energy_and_water_web.pdf#28 ) ^ ( ( this also ansewer my wondering of why norwegians would be so dumb , not to develop what they could ) ^ ) and this with the assumption that constant maximum power could be attained . 
  in reality , power is a function of [ `` satisfied '' capacity ] ( https://www.regjeringen.no/globalassets/upload/kilde/oed/bro/2006/0004/ddd/pdfv/287575-kap.02.pdf#8 ) . 
  if you even factor [ sweden ] ( https://www.worldenergy.org/data/resources/country/sweden/hydropower/ ) , we may even call this a 47 gw dream , but we are still far from the 350gw required even in this perfect case . 
   the alps is n't total shit . 
  well , compared to scandinavia , i [ would ] ( https://www.worldenergy.org/news-and-media/local-news/hydropower-storage-abroad-could-support-the-german-energiewende-wec-germany-report/ ) say so . 
   i 'm not the one arguing for a monolithic grid built on one energy-source , you at least seem to . 
  i was n't either . 
  where did i say that ? 
  for as much as yes , i do believe it could be * possible * , i 'm not advocating anything along that . 
  i 'm just pissed of everybody that simply thinks he could do well without ^ ^ and ^ ^ mind ^ ^ me , ^ ^ not ^ ^ even ^ ^ with ^ ^ data ^ ^ like ^ ^ yours , ^ ^ but ^ ^ just ^ ^ * feelings *  i 'm mostly arguing that the pan-european grid we are building will alleviate most of the problems of intermittency . 
  anything whatever-european has my approval , definitively . 
  that 's a projection , iea is n't dumb . 
  also , i 'm not sure what are you talking about . 
  wind if any cost the same only if you compare fixed costs vs every costs . 
   no it is n't . 
  yes . . [ it is ] ( http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/lessons-learned-along-europes-road-to-renewables ) ? 
   and secondly today it 's used as base power not top power that means that there is a big unutilised capacity to balance dips in wind or sun . 
  which . . would n't mean you would have to replace the electricity previously provided for baseload ? 
  i mean , i do n't have stats for this , but how much `` reservoir potential '' is wasted today ? 
  or in other words : how much time are dams not producing ? 
  edit : at least for norway , it seems there would be room for only a [ 61 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/governance_of_hydropower_in_scandinavia#norway ) increase in production . 
  which even though enough for at least two denmark , does n't seem all this philosopher stone , overall . 
   2000km is something like 2 hours in longitude but more importantly its enough in latitude to avoid the seasonal day length difference in the north . 
  interesting point . 
   but most importantly 2000km is enough to span several different climate zones which is very relevant for wind generation . 
  yes , but i guess you would agree just relying on wind would be foolish . 
   but nuclear power is already more expensive than renewables oh , yes , please , [ tell me more ] ( http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/projected_costs.pdf#page=73 ) . 
  according to whom ? 
  wind perhaps is competitive , when gas back it up i mean . 
  sorry , i see no data . 
  regardless , true or not , a * huge * increase of 1c / $ per kwh would be able to cover whatever problem you may ever have . 
  no , that 's bullshit . 
  first , in italy there are heap of crazy green hipsters ( and there were tons of subsidies till a couple of years ago ) . 
  second , perhaps we are n't denmark , nor norway . 
  next time you might have better to compare us ( it 's not like i ever mentioned that btw ) with a big state like france , uk or germany . 
  surprise surprise . 
  decommissioning costs are fixed and expected to be amortized over x time . 
  suddenly stop everything before x and no wonder you lack money . 
  hydro in scandinavia is already used . 
  and i 'm not sure 2000km connections still are enough to bypass night . 
  you know , if you close earlier plants , then there 's no fee to pay for decommissioning anymore . 
  or reprocess it \\ ^ ^, 
  you are living in a pure wishful world and have no knowledge of how interconnections work . 
  it 's crazily inefficient to send electricity over thousands of kilometers , and `` storage '' is n't going anywhere with dams already built wherever they had geological sense . 
  it would be nice if 100 % if the world was like norway ( let 's avoid to think to agriculture or climate in this dream ) , but it does n't work like that . 
  oh , they are so lucky considering their electricity prices are two times french ones !, 
  french prices , which already factor decommissioning costs for the records . 
  is n't this article a bit old ? 
   your 93 % is pulled out of your ass . 
  ( 807 + 1041 + 624 + 448 ) / 43816  you made the original claim that there is `` the fund '' and that the title says `` the fund '' . 
  you are talking of the first post i made a month ago . 
  i fixed it . 
   the made up 93 % you mean ? 
  or the individual percentages in the paper ? 
  i 'm not saying there 's single found . 
  the [ overall/average/general ] *** situation *** is though . 
   i already referred to those countries specifically in picking them . 
  not in the sentence that was supposed to be an argument . 
   this is like 8th grade info in finland that those countries specifically are worse off economically . 
  worser economically does n't necessarily mean more indebted or more `` risky '' . 
  i 'm not sure how 8th graders swallow rating agencies then . 
   did you ? 
  romania , hungary , finland and bulgaria are going to produce just 6.7 % of eu nuclear energy . 
  since we are talking of europe here , that 's what i 'm talking about . 
   so you admit you lied when you said the title says `` the fund '' even though it does n't ? 
  i just paraphrased your quotation . 
  nothing that literal if somebody is n't pedantic . 
   based on what ? 
  on the bloody percentage of what the * problem * revolves around . 
   are you going to lie about this now too ? 
  no , i 'm going to point you out again that perhaps next time you should mention which specific countries had problems in the past , if it was that was relevant today of course . 
   ergo a share you pulled out of your ass , as i only gave those as an example . 
  you know , it 's not like you ca n't read the [ original document ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/1_en_autre_document_travail_service_part1_v10.pdf#35 ) too . 
   do you really not know what the difference between `` funds '' and `` the fund '' yes , one is plural , the other is singular . 
  then ? 
   so are you saying hungary and bulgaria have made appropriate contributions to their dismantlement + burial funds ? 
  no , i 'm saying their outlook is acceptable . 
   you think government budget issues in europe are a `` rhetoric '' and not a real issue i think you are purposely inventing something i did n't say . 
   and where did pull that 93 % figure ? 
  out of your ass ? 
  6.7 % being the aforementioned energy `` share '' . 
   i have never written that , and that is the opposite what i 'm arguing . 
    not like like european government 's ever have problems with funding , right ? 
  this is what i had read . 
   you are the person who writes stuff like : `` the fund '' . 
  actually , it 's written in the title . 
   i 've argued that there seems to be a clear problem , if the figures are to be trusted , and that the situation is not good at all . 
  if world was just romania , yes , that would be the word choice i 'd use . 
  perhaps even worse . 
  but it is n't . 
   and how is it pretty good when proper funding has not been reserved for nuclear plant decommissioning and spent fuel storage ? 
  because 93 % of the fleet is on schedule . 
   where exactly is the good part in there ? 
  the remaining 93 % . 
  was it 100 , i 'd have said perfect .
