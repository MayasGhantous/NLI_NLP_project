   but then argue historical background has no relevance . 
  i did n't argued `` historical background '' per se . 
  i argued the lack of proper references . 
  i mean : you mentioned a general `` eu governments '' as if something that happened in spain should have any effect on hungary . 
   a reasonable person would think about the sovereign defaults when state funding issues are brought up without having to mention credit ratings . 
  it 's not like those three countries are argentina . 
  if any , their `` past problem '' was called communism . 
  but i did check , and indeed , aside of `` historicism '' , i see romania is n't all that good . 
   overall situation is by no means good if adequate funding has not been accumulated . 
  i did n't say perfect . 
  i said `` pretty good '' . 
   there has been multiple sovereign defaults just in the last 30 years . 
  which as i said is a totally rhetoric information with no actual relevance value in this case . 
   it 's relevant that none of those three countries are well rated by credit agencies . 
  this is already something more `` concrete '' . 
  though , [ really ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_credit_rating ) , only romania seems to be in the `` worrying '' zone . 
  putting aside doomsday is expected in the more or less remote future ( while this is a `` past record '' ) . . 
  should n't the dm like be cheering for brexit and all ? 
   the reform was the kind of utter and total shite that should 've never left the prime minister 's desk , let alone be approved by the parliament . 
  that 's what ruined every plan . 
  i thought they had [ duped ] ( https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/spotify-soundcloud-deal-dead/ ) that ? 
  then you think what `` detours from reality '' ever lead to ( or doublethinking in fiction for all that matter ) and you sink into dread !, 
  * so laughable * !, 
   pakistan on which i laughed because probably there are many people blaming eu even for that . 
  trivia : in ~ ~ 1999 ~ ~ 1991 ( or around those years iirc ) british people * wanted * poland in the eu with a quite big majority . 
  edit : [ source ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2948/britains-future.aspx ), 
  that way would already be an improvement over current trend tbh . 
   i found out on here that after berlusconi somehow the index of press freedom went down . 
  [ due ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/2vn9m0/litalia_crolla_nel_world_press_freedom_index_2015/coj7k7v/ ) to [ mafia ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/42eooj/2016_world_press_freedom_index/cz9w4lf/ ) . 
   but frankly we are at a point where the official italian press is riddled with partial narratives as well . 
  source ? 
   we live in a time when it 's hard to tell the truth apart from narratives , but frankly , in italy , from mafia to gladio to the p2 attempted coup , to aldo moro , it 's always been this way long before facebook . 
  thankfully now we can believe into chemtrails and nwo false flags !, 
   someone replied quoting a passage in which the authors deliberately juxtapose a number from a statement in grillo 's site regarding the relatively small eu relocation plan with the size of germany 's massive intake in 2015 which is something that ** do ** matter , even if we are talking about whatever renzi can and can not do . 
  also , for the life of me i ca n't understand if i 'm the only one noticing hypocrisy into blaming renzi for not doing what germany/eu is reportedly being blamed to be doing . 
  -- besides , if what you care is just the question on buzzfeed seldom producing quality articles or not , it 's not like invaliding a single secondary example changes anything . 
  we are going up the context scale , which is good . 
  * but * the most comprehensive level of the thing ( especially you know , with that evergreen weapons deals remark ) is the whole figure i was for example referring to in sweden 's case . 
  germany is selfish if it just takes 20 migrants and it 's renzi 's fault then ? 
  i could blame him for russia invading ukraine at this point , and and tsipras would be one of the greatest diplomat in history then . 
   they could n't push the person they wanted in the white house if the greatest lobbying cabinet in known history is n't `` them '' , who the hell are these people ? 
  because he 's no god ? 
  what a surprise . 
  ironically [ other people ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/eu-governments-divisive-quotas-deal-share-120000-refugees ) used the same bullying namecalls for eu , exactly to describe * the contrary * . 
   it has nothing to do with the local actions of other states in particular . 
  yes it has , considering hungary had to take almost half of the refugees and denied the whole packet altogether . 
  for example sweden was cleared of any duty since , wait for it , they * already * did even too much . 
  also , the whole scheme is on stall , since litigations [ are open ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-un-greece-iduskcn10z18u ) . 
   there is no ambiguity in the source actually it 's even false . 
  put aside the misleading claims , by october the relocation target ( in light of these problems ) had been lowered to [ 100k ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-refugee-relocation/ ) . 
  the only different use i see is the connotation of the word solution , which you use in its etymological sense ( of wiping away problems ) to refute a `` choices left '' context . 
  you acknowledge that 's the best remaining option , then you call it out because it still is n't enough to solve everything ( ie imperfect ) . 
  wishful thinking is pretending a perfect solution *** has *** to exist . 
  these realities are called southern italy and northern italy . 
   considering it 's not a solution no , it does n't put it in the correct context at all . 
  wishful thinking never led anywhere good either . 
   at no point did any other country or any european institution take an interest in solving the problem for the sake of italy or greece : the interest was always and only in solving the problem for themselves . 
  rrright . 
  germany was really struggling without that million or so syrians . 
  thanks god isis exists . 
   yeah - because normally nobody fails it since even the attempt to participate is rewarded with a 4 ( as i can tell since i got regularly `` at least he did his best '' - grade . 
  have to add here that i have a foot-disability , so it was more diffiult for me . ) . 
  to get anything worse than that , you have to activly deny to participate , as this girl did . 
  in italy too . 
  somebody might say that fucking with your very own * brain * is more disconcerting . 
  usually * everything * tends to dump ** entropy ** into * something else * . 
  if the negative impact is eventually neglilble with respect to benefits though , you tend to call it a day nevertheless . 
   from hydroelectric plants . 
  renewable , but not exactly green what ? 
  something something something the new god of war, 
  and that would be an irrelevant difference , ok . 
  i could say that situation could even be worse now , and by the quality of your counterfactual history arguments it all would be equally sound . 
  sure , mr. guess-history . 
  and russia is [ vetoing ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39pknm/spiegel_russian_veto_threatens_eu_mission_against/ ) un intervention there too . 
  which wo n't stop , you know , *** e *** migration to happen in the first place ? 
   the narrow interests that craft things like tpp do n't care about the fallout , but they have to give politicians something to wave in front of nervous constituents regardless . 
  roger that , and legit . 
  but to be really honest , as i was saying in my first post , the interests are as narrow ... as the `` scissor '' of `` exploitation allowed '' is wide . 
   strangely , the current one is more likely to challenge adherence to trade agreement requirements like the cambodia one . 
  my impression is that current one is more likely to challenge just anything . 
   the comparison is because you appear to assume that the eu is going to act differently . 
  i do . 
  i 'm trusting them more then my government , for the records . 
  i can hardly remember a time they screwed hard . 
   no one 's going to shift their production to japan , so that 's probably true in this case . 
  yeah , i guess that 's what happens when trade agreements are made between more or less equally rich countries . 
  the market `` composition '' remains the same , only population number increase . 
   problem is that , in this context , it 's window-dressing to make the agreement palatable in the first place and tamp down opposition . 
  sorry , is n't your exact claim that they are n't giving any shit regardless ? 
  so , what 's even the point ? 
   your government might take a sincere approach to these things , but ours does n't well , certainly not your current one . 
  anyway , i 'm not sure if you are aware it . . why the comparison ? 
   it 's not the 80 's anymore , maybe it 's changed . 
  but you should at least be prepared to have to deal with it . 
  fine . 
   given that 's what the treaty is supposed to focus on along with automobiles , it should oh , mhh . . 
  sorry , yes , i guess you are right . 
   few places have that sort of dependency , though , or the kind of pressure we had to apply to them . 
  just be aware of the favored tactics , which i 'm sure the eu people making decisions already are . 
  sure , i guess people wo n't die without cheese ( * i * would ) .
