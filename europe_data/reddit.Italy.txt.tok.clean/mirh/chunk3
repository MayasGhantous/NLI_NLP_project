  it 's even true your debt [ skyrocketed ] ( https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/gfdegdq188s ) in these years . 
  somebody hates france ? 
  i can see the points for britain . . but not for hollande, 
  with this mind , people like snowden , assange or the next new jew-consipiracy ethnicity would be fucked, 
  it 's not with this `` others are morons , let 's do the same '' attitude that you 'll get it . 
  check [ arstechnica ] ( http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2015/06/eu-plans-to-destroy-net-neutrality-by-allowing-internet-fast-lanes/ ) if you get the paywall, 
  the original , lossless version of this image is [ here ] ( https://languagemaps.wordpress.com/2014/05/20/italian-dialects/ ), 
   although nuclear technically is n't fossil fuel it 's still polluting and non renewable . 
  yes , but it 's not polluting in the same sense of fossil fuels . 
  especially because that pollution is not blindly released in the air . 
  and please , renewable is just a word for many bullshits . 
  perhaps you wanted to say clean energy , and that 's a point for solar and wind . 
  but remember that even biofuels are considered `` renewable '' and they are not better than fossil fuels when you use them . 
  said this , yeah , i 'm also sure france may generate lots of sustainable energy given it 's a big country and all . 
  but remember that you also need baseload power . 
  and it goes [ crap ] ( http://www.rawscience.tv/german-coal-use-at-highest-level-since-1990-despite-rise-in-solar/ ) when you reject the only kind of energy that can produce it without emissions, 
  100 % renewable is out of mind . 
  at least unless we are talking of norway , or iceland http://www.vox.com/2015/6/9/8748081/us-100-percent-renewable-energy, 
  this is the best on all the net http://www.ecofys.com/files/files/asn-ecofys-2013-world-ghg-emissions-flow-chart-2010.pdf, 
  the problem is * not * ending the oil . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/22/earth-day-scientists-warning-fossil-fuels -, 
   countries with over 60 % in total renewable energy generation ( hydro ~ ~ and other renewables put together ~ ~ ) are iceland , norway , sweden , switzerland , portugal and austria . 
  no shit sherlock also , please notice that the only big country with a `` normal '' territory which is almost fossil-free is france, 
  i 'm not arguing austerity or anything now . 
  i 'm just recommending you that given you do n't trust the main stream narrative , this does n't mean you are authorized to trust blindly whatever alternative stream narrative tell you . 
  especially given that frankly that website seems one of those conservative circlejerks with , you know , climate change denying , praise to american 's descents and all . 
  said this ( after 10 freaking minutes looking for the right google query ) i finally found something that [ may somewhat be ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/24/us-unicredit-loans-prelios-iduskcn0id1w720141024 ) what that article is referring to . 
  except that there 's no mention of any 1b $ transaction ( on the contrary it seems to acknowledge there has n't been any big one in previous years ) and the conspiracy levels are pretty scaled down . 
  again , i 'm gently asking you if you can provide something that 's not a pdf about claims made by nonexistent entities . 
  it 's not critical if you follow two chem trails sorcerers and an inexistent newspaper, 
  i guess so . 
  but i also believe it 's by following this kind of unfunded stories people lose their critic mind . 
  if you put in this way , no . 
  but i 'm reasonably sure austerity had nothing to do with unemployment , * since * factories had already started to close before . 
  youth unemployment started to go crap in 2008 . 
  and only stabilized recently . 
  while austerity were done , no relevant change happened * of course * this ( lack of ) correlation does n't mean causation . 
  but in economy i have never seen some way to definitively rule of something else, 
  i do n't gamble , sorry . 
  still , i do n't see any bad reason for it not to happen, 
  we are already at 2.6 . ^ [ 1 ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/economia/2015/02/05/news/previsioni_economiche_commissione_ue-106584218/ ) and with pil increasing even further next year , it 's not that crazy to think, 
  it does n't necessarily imply that , but it definitively rules out your assertion . 
  besides , our deficit is finally below 3 % and next year if nothing goes wrong it should fall below 2 %, 
  haunting a defaulting state is pretty easy i guess , especially with hordes of highly paid economists at your service . 
  similarly i do n't see anything strange with bonds affair . 
  i mean . . if the state it 's in trouble , of course its bond will have an higher interest rate , and of course speculating firms will embark in flocks, 
  i saw it . 
  and i tried to look in ameco database . 
  but i could n't really find any data supporting the claim, 
  this . 
  it 's not a surprise if youth employment sucks . 
  to be fair , i could n't find anything about this story . 
  first , there 's no newspaper with that name in italy . 
  second , marco zanni and marco valli are two member of the 5 stars movements , which is very known for its conspiracy unfunded theories . 
  still given arguments ad hominem are not arguments at all , would n't you have some more funded source ? 
  wtf ? 
  is philosophy in france actually doing the philosophy ? 
  because here it 's actually more like studying * history of * philosophy and there 's not usually many space for personal thought . 
  actually , italian banks are n't doing very well . 
  what are you referring to ? 
  again , you seem to confuse causes with effects . 
  we did n't go into austerity mode because * air * . 
  we went on it specifically because shit was already happening . 
  please notice how austerities made some years ago had their fruits . 
  lower security for workers * means * in fact , that you can finally be fired for something that it 's not destroying the whole factory . 
  policies were way too unbalanced previously . 
  again with that graph . 
  where did it come from ? 
  and how the hell a prediction made in 2012 , is already wrong even at `` predicting '' what happened the previous year ? 
  a million ? 
  10 millions then . 
  seriously , obviously it 's not like we are going to get 1 % of africa upon us . 
  source ? 
  and could you explain why an assumption made in 2012 ... is already made on wrong data ? 
  trust me , there 's no better alternative at the moment and in the foreseeable future . 
  i wo n't be completely convinced until kim dies or gtfo . 
  which i believe may count as postponing actually . 
  it 's funny how salvini 's most beloved man ( and financier ) is also the leader of the nation that objected intervention against smugglers . 
  most of the actual problem resides in the fact they think euro was the cause for price increases . 
  tbh instead single vendors had been responsible for `` rounding '', 
  it 's not exactly like that . 
  ln is getting votes in the south . . because they are forming alliances under a completely different name in the first place . 
  and still , ~ 0.5 % of votes is n't that incredible in the northern region , we may say they are now the first right wing party ... but it 's because the other right wing party collapsed . 
  i mean , people 's mind did n't change a lot . 
  tuscany being the biggest example . 
  then , if we really had to compare single parties ( and not coalitions ) pd is the first one in every region except aforementioned veneto . 
   our people were bigots long before that , you ca n't deny there is a perpetual tendency for scapegoating present here upheld by xenophobia . 
  i can not , but you ca n't deny that without that situation would have been much better, 
   heartened by recent election successes by an anti-immigrant party this is pretty misleading title . 
  of the seven regions which went voting , only one was won by ln ( which was already theirs anyway ) overall , net balance was 4 regions `` conquered '' by left-wing pd . 
  this is just about veneto and lombardia presidents , which are perhaps a third of the whole northern italy . 
  it 's not all that difficult when all fucking talk-shows air 24/7 salvini ( lega nord secretary , which if you do n't know is somewhat on the extreme right of political spectrum ) and this is not only happening on berlusconi 's tv channels , albeit they show greater than norm xenophobic biases indeed . 
  ask german electors . 
  i recall uncle adolf saying the same after poland got visited by soldiers . 
  except that time they had not been so hypocrite to claim those was n't their army . 
  actually , in turn we say our southerns inhabitants are lazy mooches . 
  ^ ^ [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/384tcj/regional_gdp_ppp_per_capita_in_the_eu_1027x1370/ ), 
  yes , but i guess it 's way easier to ( socially ) stand these unprofitable jobs when everybody has the same middle or middle-low income, 
   policy in france has been directed at protecting people who hold jobs with the implicit result of lower job creation . 
  that 's also similar to what happened in italy . . in the last decades .
