  you basically have  40 years old with exceptionally loose contracts . 
  getting fired unless you destroy half of the company is almost impossible and you have all kind of social assistance . 
  on the other hand younger have few to none rights and shitty contracts . 
  * actually * they only gained voters because they allied in southern regions with less southern-fobic parties . 
  said this , 5 regions went to the centre-left party of the prime minister renzi , one to centre-right ( what 's left of berlusconi 's party ) and just * one * went to salvini lead party . 
  this out of 7 voting regions, 
  genuine question : are `` golden pensions '' just an italian thing ? 
  golden pensions being those fucking high , even more than 90000 $ * a month *, 
   i like the idea of security through obscurity much more . 
  what ? 
  really , no . 
  security through obscurity means that you ca n't access / `` read '' the software ( think to the contrary of open source ) anyway , this encryption scheme seems reasonably robust . 
  though , it 's not like you need a degree to use keepass , or to copy paste ( still offline ) the database . 
  then there should be cloud 3rd party services too i believe, 
  and that 's why it 's inherently more secure . 
  btw your link is wrong . 
  it should be . org edit : mhh . . indeed i looked at it , and it 's open source too ( a must if you are that kind of paranoiac guy that want security ) there 's even a [ discussion on reddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/32wlky/encryptr_zeroknowledge_system_based_password/ ) ... but , can you still have local copies then ? 
  no , they are aiming a bit higher . 
  you know little medieval communes isolated from the rest of civilization ? 
  well , that 's the idea , for whole europe and possibly the world . 
  [ keepass ] ( http://keepass.info/ )   other password solutions but thanks for telegram2 link,

  how could he dislike euro when poland is the bigger eu benefiter ? 
  because there 's this who cares ? 
  attitude that is deeply eradicated . 
  i mean : politic is shit , politicians are like mob and whatever . 
  also , i 'd say 70 % of young people would n't be able to distinguish between stupid rhetoric and actual facts . 
  i do n't know what the percentage might be with 30 + though . 
  i pay 5 $ for 3gb [ . 
  ] ( http://www.tre.it/opzioni/internet-con-telefonino/super-internet-ricaricabile ) so technically i could get ** 21gb ** for that price, 
  ok but you see your problem ? 
  if nobody had attacked libya ( and somebody had help syrians ) it 's not like you could n't still invert your claims, 
  so you are contemporaneously saying usa and eu suck because they * did * chose to intervene in libya ... and because they * did not * chose to intervene in syria . . what the hell ? 
  and * we * invented the scientific study ^ ^, 
  even as a northern italian , i did n't think difference was all this big . 
  i asserts you also need integration in gastronomic area, 
  yes , but who do you think migrant quotas are for ? 
  [ italy is the third most requested asylum country ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24583286 ) , toghether with france [ similarly they are on par even for accepted request ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32719014 ) the most loved country , it seems , is germany . 
  [ which as you can see ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitviewtableaction.do ) has managed to actually decrease unemployment . 
  it 's not that difficult to notice how they are barely 0.1 % of the [ workforce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_labour_force ) . 
  hopefully they are n't going to sell shells on the baltic sea too . 
  hey , it 's normal here . 
  and the shitton of refugees that came this year did n't seem to have influenced it at all, 
  and percentage of immigrants seemed to follow an upward trend . 
  and just for the records , in all civilized world violent crime has follow a downward trend since the 1990s , not only sweden . 
   mbt still have an important role to play any combatground active today and in which of these would dutches be involved ? 
  you have a crisis of faith with * yourself * . 
  proving loyalty is something you would do if * others * were to question it . 
  25 % of crimes came from immigrants ( as you linked ) ^ ^ [ 1 ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20051214/2683 ) in 1998 inhabitants of a foreign background comprised around 20 % of the swedish population ^ ^ [ 2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden#immigration ) ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ percentage ^ ^ ^ higher ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ subsequent ^ ^ ^ years so what ? 
  the mother mentioned in the article is the girl 's one . 
  and it 's the boy that ca n't speak italian,

  ~ ~ futile ~ ~ petty reasons then . 
  i 'm saying actual reports provides conflicting information and that besides , even if it was the case , it would n't be anything but one of the thousands of daily bullying cases . 
  today it 's him for the crucifix , tomorrow it will be somebody else for red hair . 
  ansa is a quite reliable source , definitively . 
  still , they are still just reporting what other journals said . 
  if i try to look in the local newspaper , i found that the story is quite . . [ cloudy ] ( http://www.giornaledellumbria.it/article/article227364.html ) i mean , first he was said to have told policemen his reasons . 
  now the headmaster of the school claims he could barely say `` hi '' . 
  why the hell his ignorance of the language would worsen the meaning of whatever actions he did ? 
  and why you just read the parts of the articles you wanted ? 
  [ other sources ] ( http://www.giornaledellumbria.it/article/article227364.html ) ( sorry , just italian ) claim he could barely say hi . 
  that there are shittons of morons out there bullying each other all days . 
  this does not mean we are going to be angry towards all blond people , all tall men or all women with whatever attribute offender had . 
  besides , while referring to this specific story , it 's quite weird how according to some reports ( which states this boy has been living here just for 3 weeks ) he can barely speak italian , while in others he conversed with policemen explaining the reasons of his actions and all . 
   while comparing the statistics of q4 with the ones of q1 is simply fundamentally wrong . 
  ok , but then do n't try to pass this message in the title, 
  sure . 
  i mean , i know it does even support to play external ( local ) tracks . 
  basically all formats but flac though , which is a big flaw imo, 
  i do n't know if you noticed the italic . . 
   the ukrainian economy shrunk 17.6 % in the first quarter of 2015 ** compared to the same period last year ** compared to the final quarter of 2014 the fall in first quarter gdp was * only * 6.5 %, 
  i 'm pretty sure vorbis @ 320kbps ( available only to premium subscribers though ) is pretty indistinguishable, 
   low income i do n't know . . at least in my country , education ( rather than income ) is the barrier to even realize what reddit is .

  the egg/chicken is already there : it can run android apps , so no problems . 
  for the fs problems on the other hand . . 
  it 's not good, 
  when you have people like salvini and grillo . . 
  it 's impossible, 
  buy jolla !, 
  neither italy it seems,

  i was especially referring to his statements ( made between today and yesterday i believe ) about the refugees quota system proposed at the european parliament . 
  anyhow , i see he 's not the mad guy i thought, 
  sorry , i should have specified better . 
  why is such a pain in the arse when it comes to * refugees * ? 
   damn commie is there something that ca n't be * socialized * ? 
   czech president is ardent euro-optimist may i ask why it 's such a pita when it comes to ~ ~ migrants ~ ~ refugees instead ? 
  surprised ? 
  sad perhaps . 
  or ashamed . 
  but but but . . western junta bought citizens approval !, 
  us must have screwed them , it 's plain obvious .

  well , they never gained wide support , especially in northern italy where the xenophobic electorate is monopolized by ln . 
  this is why they all ( somewhat ) allied to focus on the south , where as you can imagine salvini is not very popular ( even though he 's recently raising the bar of hypocrisy with his `` excuses '' ) .
