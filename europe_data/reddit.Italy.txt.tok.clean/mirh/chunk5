  nevertheless , they are not even near the maddness levels of [ casapound ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casapound ) ^ ^ english ^ ^ wikipedia ^ ^ is ^ ^ not ^ ^ quite ^ ^ comprehensive, 
  who do you mean ? 
  oh , good guy adolf . 
  so the question now is : did he learn itself this from somebody else ? 
  well , you may all know the main far right party in italy , lega nord . 
  they recently turned to almost extremist level when they decided to ally with the faaaaaaaaaaaaaaar right `` casapound '' that probably think mussolini has been too a pussy . 
   stalin attacked poland on 17 september 1939 , in accordance with the molotov-ribbentrop deal , on the pretext that he had to ** protect ** ukrainian and belarussian ** minorities ** . 
  oh , so it 's him that putin has learned the old story from, 
  he was doubtful between 2 things . 
  if the felony was saying `` islam is shit '' , technically it would n't be a different offense if you were eating pork . 
  or swearing allah . 
  on the other hand , i believe only targeting its practitioners ( just because they are ) is what could be punishable, 
  ok then , i searched a bit and it seems the interview is [ this ] ( http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/newspaper/top-stories/labour-to-outlaw-islamophobia-says-miliband-in-an-exclusive-interview/ ) ( it 's a bit weird though , since google search seemed cluttered by extreme right websites , contrarily to the usual randomness ) anyway , i somewhat get the impression he 's implying hate towards islam is not already a hate crime . 
  though wikipedia thinks [ something else ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_crime#united_kingdom ) ... idk, 
  it 's not like you can really target ideas . 
  what 's next ? 
  call them crimethoughts ? 
  on the other hand , saying `` we should kill them all '' is already another thing . 
  but i believe that would be [ incitement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incitement ) which should be already covered by law, 
  islamophobia * has to be * something against people . 
  otherwise if it was for ideologies , all pork eater would be transgressors . 
  therefore i do n't see the point . 
  is n't religious hate already a crime ? 
  are you sure ? 
  are you serious ? 
  there 's no way anybody with a pinch of salt would still be in favor after erdogan 's fuckups, 
  i guess the main problem is there 's not actually a libyan government, 
   diamonds , salt , gold , iron , cobalt , uranium , copper , bauxite , silver , petroleum , cocoa beans , woods , tropical fruits it wo n't be minerals or oil to feed population . 
  there 's really few space suitable for farming . 
  you ca n't just cut down tropical forest and hope to use it for more than a couple of year . 
  soil * requires * the vegetation it has always had to maintain its fertility . 
  otherwise you risk miserable scenarios like in brazil . 
  and do you know what would have happened otherwise ? 
  there would have been even more hostile barbarians and even less soldiers between romans military, 
  3 times the area . . 
  but how many resources ? 
  i find hard to think crops grow in similar fashions, 
  [ constitution ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/constitution_of_italy#art._75 ) repels referendums * in the case of tax , budget , amnesty and pardon laws , in authorization or ratification of international treaties . 
  * this has probably been done because economy was felt something too technical for people to directly affect it . 
  i do n't know . . 
  when i was in high school i was completely numb , politically speaking . 
  and by the time you are 18 ~ 19 , i know people that are already `` mentally regressed '' past elementary school . . ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ sad, 
  i do n't know . . there should be already `` civic education '' school subject . 
  but most of times it 's skipped altogether or students gives no damns . 
   who defines ` basic knowledge of politics ' ? 
  well , for example , here in italy there 's this stupid fable that says prime minister government is illegitimate because it has been not voted by people . 
  and you often hear this claim on tv , radio etc. . 
  but actually constitution just demands president of republic to nominate it . 
  other recurrent hoaxes are referendums for quitting euro which some parties viciously tell the population to be lawful , whilst they are forbidden by constitution itself . 
  it would n't be bad if people with certain diverted beliefs could * at least * be warned to be at fault, 
  [ translated original article ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwebcache.googleusercontent.com%2fsearch%3fq%3dcache%3aaynbhsfsmbij%3awww.newbur.ru%2farticles%2f21063%2b%26cd%3d1%26hl%3dru%26ct%3dclnk%26gl%3dru&amp;edit-text= ), 
  why not ? 
  it 's amazing i can travel in europe without hassles . 
  i do n't see why i should trrat a german different from a french , or my neighbor, 
  japan has really strict laws for weapons, 
  if nuclear fission happens in submarines in the waters all around the world nobody gives a damn if the same process happens inside a controlled reactor with more and more meters of concrete everybody loses their mind, 
  it 's the ground under ukraine that attracted missiles !, 
  italy had basically no central government between 476 and the second half of 19th century . 
  germany on the other hand had a basic kind of political unity . 
  like that , but not czech republic specific, 
  this is not actually . . * that subreddit with balls *, 
  russia ( and then eastern europe ) has n't been victim of * communism * . 
  its problem has always been a forced dictatorship that lenin * might * have meant to be be temporary but stalin set as rule . 
  then nobody ever cared to restore democracy, 
  definitively . 
  unless you think that throngs of underpaid people is what makes a countries rich . 
  the heavy emigration is a proof . 
  edit : [ other example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/301gjy/some_european_countries_gnp_per_capita_before_and/ ), 
  and you seem confused between what * sounds * logic and what * is * logic and you have a quite short memory too . 
  let 's say you 'll probably think that us started korean war , just because ... and try to ask yourself why all rich countries are not aligned with russia, 
   it 's deeply rooted in human nature to preserve our cultural diversity and go against the strongest . 
  and this mr. freud , where did it come from ? 
  : / i say human nature is just psychological bullshit and that you should think before acting . 
  in this case putin is the moron of the situation, 
  mhh . . like what ? 
  freedom of press ? 
  condemnation of north korea ? 
  cmon . . and please i did not say others are perfect instead, 
  i wonder why in the world you are even talking of ro , hu , bg , fi ( 6,7 % of total `` energy share '' ) to contest a claim about [ overall ] `` situation '' . 
   furthermore , the funds in romania , hungary and bulgaria are held by the state treasury directly . 
  not like like european government 's ever have problems with funding , right ? 
  not like rhetoric points are anything aside of that . 
   therefore the electricity produced during this time should n't be compared , and in reality , the fund 's could be adequately built up and the payment level sustainable . 
  i do n't know details , but i do n't think people supervising that are forgetting either . 
  i mean , it could be if reprocessing was something born yesterday , but it 's a somewhat standard procedure , at least in the eu . 
   the truth is that fossil fuels are not competitive without subsidies . 
  mhh , truth is a bit gray-ish , given most of `` subsidies '' are not `` per se '' but more for-poor http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/11/13/renewables-get-25-times-the-subsidy-that-fossil-fuels-do/ http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/08/04/the-imfs-absurd-calculations-of-fossil-fuel-subsidies-its-really-not-2200-for-every-american/, 
   it 's `` android '' under your own personal definition . 
  which is anything based on aosp code . 
  linux kernel with ion memlry allocator , dalvik/art , bionic and their special display server . 
   but , more importantly than diving into technicalities it 's not like there 's anything more important . 
  a rose with another ~ ~ name ~ ~ trademark is still a rose . 
   the google apps , including google play services , are an integral part of the user experience of an android device and are n't open source . 
  their are integral according to your standards ( ie most of the sold phones ) . 
  but i already used successfully bare aosp and i could say that 's as much integral as one can need . 
  how can that not be android ? 
   android ( tm ) devices do include them . 
  not every one . 
  and you do n't need them to [ be ] ( https://source.android.com/ ) `` android '' . 
  the same thing is also mentioned in your quote .
