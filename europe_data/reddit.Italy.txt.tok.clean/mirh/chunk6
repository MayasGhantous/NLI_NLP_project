   google forces the manufacturers to include their apps and services or you ca n't use the android trademark . 
  except you know , amazon . 
  and all those chinese oems . 
   hanff said he had received written confirmation from the dcms that the use of ad-blockers was legal , but the department did not comment on use of ad-blocker-blockers . 
  hanff said in the session that he had spoken to eu regulators who are of the view that they are n't legal , referencing the guardian 's recent trialling of whitelisting content . 
   he went on to explain that the guardian 's social media management software provided by tribal fusion enables tracking and data mining of users `` without the consent of the user to allow that tracking of data '' in order to feed back to advertisers . 
  this is really just about one kind of ad-blocking detection . 
  and i really would n't know how somebody could declare them illegal , given websites are free to accept whoever they want . 
   which does n't include some parts like the google apps and some internal services . 
  which are not part of android . 
  * please * do n't spread fud . 
   they 're not complaining that android exists , they just want android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to have more freedom in the way they use android . 
  oh , you mean those same device manufacturers and network operators that rape the good of an otherwise open system ? 
  that will definitively increase user experience !, 
  childishly populist is better perhaps ? 
  on the other hand putin has been `` pretty confrontational '' with some minorities , if you know what i mean . 
  trump * is * big businesses . . 
  seems fair . 
  even though i would n't know if they reach rt bullshit level ( aka physics is optional ), 
  the story was `` some isis oil is sold in turkey '' . 
  on rt it became `` turkey buys oil from isis '', 
  never critical of anything russia possibly might have done . 
  some says it 's just because it 's directly financed by the government , but that would be an ad hominem attack i guess, 
  he said rt does n't count . 
  because bombs in pakistan or iraq totally are n't killong muslims, 
  to be honest , i was referring to the fact that `` lethargic '' and `` catatonic '' is everything but the mice experiment end , if i can explain . 
  said this , the abstract was still pretty interesting . 
   stress occurs when homeostasis is threatened or perceived to be so another difference between mouse experiment and actual `` human society '' is that you are n't confined in a cage . 
  hell , perhaps you are * confined on earth * but i think `` things to see '' and `` things to do '' scale exponentially once you are out of a 3x1 .5 prison . 
   if an animal/human does not receive enough impulses , it becomes lethargic or even catatonic . 
  i 'm not sure we are talking of the same `` stress '' then . 
  mhh , i 'd say it 's simply unfair rather than harmful , but they have a point . 
   it describes what happens when you take away stress and danger and force social interaction on a social animal no . 
  it tells you there are more than just `` physical resources '' ( as in food , air , water ) that a sane mind needs . 
  taking away stress is everything but problematic , especially if , you know , somebody else worry about your necessities . 
  probably i should have figured out he was talking about [ this ] ( http://www.mae.ro/en/node/36659 ) . 
  my bad . 
  well , in that case it would indeed be cool i guess . 
  they have n't to . 
  i was just commenting the `` finally we are doing something '' logic . 
  which completely overfly the `` what is something '' part . 
  i dunno , i could have said ukraine as well , but it would be like shooting to apples in a barrel, 
   like in that mouse utopia-experiment . 
  that 's about `` post-scarcity economy '' and the danger of uncontrolled growth ( which in the end led to overpopulation in relation to society ) [ . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/45o5p5/czechoslovak_jokes_about_the_communist_regime/czzq74q ) it has really nothing to do with other kinds of utopia , paradise or whatever you want to call it . 
  yes , sorry . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/appendices/radioactive-waste-management-appendix-4-national-f.aspx ) 's the economic framework in most countries . 
  yes , which one priced at , let 's use a conservatice 15c/kwh makes exactly $ 120b a year . 
  and believe or not , waste disposal costs are already factored in that , in basically every country from usa to uk . 
  i see no sources there for these whishes . 
  [ mine ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2015/05/01/why-teslas-powerwall-is-just-another-toy-for-rich-green-people/ ) on the other hand says that 's going to be a dream for decades . 
  this is utter bullshit ( not surpinsgly they quoted a greenpeace adviser ) $ 253b will be needed ** by 2050 ** $ 133b are available - in the funds - ** now ** if you go on [ reading actual report ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/4dc0tv/europe_faces_253bn_nuclear_waste_bill/d1pve0g ) then situation is pretty good . 
  and where in the world am i bragging about debt being *** always *** hell on earth ? 
  i just told you , italy specific situation was limited by that . 
  it 's funny when you see that what was once said to be the evil german empire sucking blood from greece , is now the candid sheep . 
  https://wikileaks.org/imf-internal-20160319/transcript/imf%20anticipates%20greek%20disaster.pdf#page=6 by the way , if you just continue to read the conversation , you see it 's just people informally conversing , with all the implications and consequences of `` not sticking with etiquette '' . 
  and unless you want to imply irony ( hard to do in a text transcript ) they seem to care for the general situation . 
  [ regional chart ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/gdp_at_regional_level ) gives you more of a hint of the problem . 
  for the eleventh damn time . 
  you ca n't play roosevelt with an insane 120 % debt . 
  and of course it 's not like the crisis can be a common cause to both . 
  now , tell me , how are you so sure austerity caused problems instead of either relieving them or having no effect ? 
  of course , given you are taking into account something in people 's mind instead of a `` fact '' like nationality . 
  we are in contact with indians since ancient greeks , yet there 's nothing special in this 3 . 
  cut this bs . 
  we are in 21st century . 
  3rd millennia . 
  we do n't give a damn about religion . 
  if any , this is a rhetoric argument present at most in the extremist propaganda to depict today world ( believe or not the most peaceful ever ) like a crusade . 
  the worst thing is not when this propaganda only influences muslims , but when it does also affects westerns thought . 
  or a repetition if any ? 
  if any though i guess you have to temporally limit yourself with the meaning of `` aftermath '' . 
  otherwise . . 
  i dunno . . should i particularly blame romans or ancient greeks ? 
  what ? 
  it 's not like a war is something to be absolutely happy about . 
  more rigorous fun fact : the problem was n't actually about the invasion itself , but more with the aftermath . 
  it either is or is n't . 
  bend to what ? 
  action what ? 
  diplomacy is no poland invasion you know . 
  as i said in another comment , that 's not to be ruled off either . 
  the two things are n't mutually exclusive . 
  i do n't read the thing , but i 'd be glad if you could enlighten me . 
   that 's already possible within the confines of the current legal framework . 
  there 's no contradiction in reaffirming that . 
  it might be redundant , but there 's no `` practical issue '' . 
  unless you something negating that , your point is just empty rhetoric . 
  like night and day ? 
  unilateral decision vs plain suggestion ? 
  oh cmon , fuck the bait  the european commission will be obliged to ** consult ** with us authorities before adopting new legislative proposals following passage of [ ttip ], 
   that is the consequence of what i just stated . 
  ehrm . . this is a bit too of a hasty conclusion . 
  i mean , it really smells like `` post hoc ergo propter hoc '' . 
  i believe the [ point ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/price%e2%80%93anderson_nuclear_industries_indemnity_act ) is more about they * ca n't * rather than they do n't * want * . 
   in case of germany they build up a reserve of some 40 billion $ . 
  however , those are bound to investments like pp shares and not directly available . 
  estimates on the costs for decommissioning and disposal are ways above that number . 
  decommissioning and disposal is a totally different matter than incidents . 
  and those costs are already factored in fuel costs in basically every country .
