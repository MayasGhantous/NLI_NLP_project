   even though legally obligated ( as you quoted correctly due to the need that no private insurance company wants to do that ) , npps do not have the sufficient ammount of insurance capital to cover even the most basic long term commitments . 
  i 'm not reading that between the lines . 
  what `` long term commitments '' are you referring to ? 
   interestingly enough , german energy industry tried to pull out of that legal obligation by splitting off the expensive npps in bad bank style subs . 
  source ? 
  because really , it really does n't seem an active `` expense '' considering there are no problems at the moment , and it 's just about getting money/interests  do i have to ? 
  insurance companies did . 
  - c.f. 
  previous post technically this could even just mean they feel to be too small in the case of worse case scenario . 
  it 's not actually about it being probable , but more about having the whole company bankrupting in just a single event . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/research/soar.html ) is the most updated report i 'm aware , and as i said above , it does n't seem to depict an apocalyptic situation, 
  http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/liability-for-nuclear-damage.aspx https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna_convention_on_civil_liability_for_nuclear_damage surprise ^ and ^ you ^ still ^ have n't ^ assessed [ ^ * risk * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/risk_ ( statistics ) ^ btw, 
  that just because there is a danger it does n't mean risk is high . 
  once you take into account this , there is n't much left to `` wonder '', 
  you know , it 's not like you ca n't still make a cost/benefits analysis . 
  also , you should learn the difference between danger and risk . 
  damns are the best energy source economically , if you have the right place to build them . 
  yes , due to radiophobia . 
  not actual `` physical '' problems . 
  like compared to what ? 
   if you give 5 and receive 5 financially speaking you are contributing absolutely nothing . 
  again , you are part of eu . 
  your problem is with identifying the eu as a * completely * separate entity , when in fact you are technically inside . 
   the eu has no money , money comes from the member states and is either returned to them via eu spending or perhaps your problem is with identifying some metaphysics land where the set `` eu '' and the set `` eu members '' differ . 
   it would seem you did not change the graph so that it showed `` operating budgetary balance '' , which shows the net contribution for each country . 
  uh , sorry , i had miss the point was about `` net '' . 
  but now i do n't understand why he mentioned that in the first place , considering `` wealth '' is related to gdp , rather than `` spending over income '' . 
   which is obviously not an accurate representation of how much a country actually contributes to the eu . 
  what ? 
  it really does . 
  suppose you spent 5 and received 5 , you are still contributing more than one that spent 2 . 
  you are ** yourself ** part of eu . 
   but only just , the only difference between the uk 's rebate and normal eu funding is that the uk government gets to choose how it is spent . 
  and after you account for their hipsterism they are below . 
  in the previous example money indeed is `` eu '' . 
  here it 's still uk . 
   this is not accurate either . 
  italy is the 5th largest net contributor ( 2014 ) according to this . 
  that 's * spending * ( aka money goes out ) . 
  not ** contributing ** ( aka money comes in ) . 
  italy is indeed [ 3rd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#eu-28_contributions_.282014.29 ) . 
   he/she said again because he/she was reiterating his/her point , `` why would germany want that '' . 
  that seems pretty obvious . 
  why would germany want a lot of exportation ? 
  yes , that seems pretty obvious . 
  but my point is more about him asking this stupid question , which contrarily to his expectations ( that i guess he had , otherwise the question would be ot ) is n't mutually exclusive with union and all . 
   maybe because a fix for the current economic situation would mean the creation of fiscal transfers which would inevitably mean huge sums of money being sent from germany ( and other north european countries ) to the poorer states . 
  or perhaps you know , that 's indeed what they are working on ? 
  again what ? 
  if we were speaking of different things , it 's not like this can be the same one * again * . 
  why would germany not want a more united europe in your opinion ? 
  because i mean , everything merkel is pushing for is exactly going in that direction afaik . 
   an optimal currency area is often larger than a country . 
  for instance , part of the rationale behind the creation of the euro is that the individual countries of europe do not each form an optimal currency area , but that europe as a whole does form an optimal currency area . 
  and i 'd also add  the notion of a currency that does not accord with a state , specifically one larger than a state -- formally , of an international monetary authority without a corresponding fiscal authority -- has been criticized by keynesian and post-keynesian economists , who emphasize the role of deficit spending by a government ( formally , fiscal authority ) in the running of an economy , and consider using an international currency without fiscal authority to be a loss of `` monetary sovereignty '' . 
  which tbh is what in the end we 'd be trying to push forward . 
   why would germany want to fix the euro ? 
  fix as in monetary union . 
  not necessarily as in value . 
  fascism and nazism have a common root in the end imo . 
  and i do n't think we can individuate it in the 30s . 
  they are working on at least half of those fronts . 
   we have a monetary union that many economists warned would turn ugly many economists warned on the methods used to make that union happen , if any . 
  nobody ever claimed united was gon na be worse . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_and_monetary_union_of_the_european_union good reading . 
  remember you ca n't have everything instantly with the snap of a finder . 
   because germans do n't want to fix it . 
  they do n't ** want ** or they *** ca n't *** ^ ( [ magically shake the wand and fix it ] ) ? 
  because i mean . . it 's not like almost everybody ai n't indeed working for a closer economical union . 
  there would still be a dictator or who knows , it would have been facing the same problems of assad . 
  so , [ again ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/44w04j/la_trappola_di_draghi_che_metter%c3%a0_ko_renzi_e/cztmwhk ) the question is : why reinventing the wheel when you can just fix it ? 
   read some books about the ** 1930s ** deflation in europe  [ ... ] and the ** following ** rise of fascism . 
  you are at least 10 years late man . 
   what a great times for italy-libya relations back than when gadaffi was the ruler . 
  it still is a damn [ big deal ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/31v62e/leni_lunica_grande_societ%c3%a0_rimasta_in_libia_il/ ) for italy . 
  no love for salvini ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-%2f%2fep%2f%2fnonsgml%2bpv%2b20160225%2bres-rcv%2bdoc%2bpdf%2bv0%2f%2fen&amp;language=en#page=162 ) you can see votes by parliamentarians for every single [ proposal ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?type=motion&amp;reference=p8-rc-2016-0151&amp;language=en ) . 
  intriguingly , it seems only lepen and salvini 's enf voted against basically * everything * . 
  ecr and ppe instead choose to vote no only to some parts . 
  how about [ one-in-every-two migrants were syrians ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/5683d0b56.html ) ? 
  i do n't see your source though . 
  they did n't act * because * they were white . 
  they * already * wanted to act , and they choose x because she had this or that requirement . 
  they are different concepts . 
   the german government expects a total influx of 3.6 million refugees by 2020 , with an average of half a million people arriving each year [ and including the 1.1 already arrived ] it 's actually a decrease in yearly numbers . 
  and . . 
  i guess these stats assume a steady situation where nothing evolves . 
  but i 'd look forward to have things fixed in both libya and syria in a dozen of month . 
  no , it 's just that if i want to read a website ( aka exploiting its work ) , i accept what it burdens on me . 
  i do n't need and want an adblocker either tbh . 
  if you just pass over the baiting title , you see this has nothing to do with unions . 
   actually renzi and other party leaders said that all mps are free to vote what they want without consequences . 
  mhh , source ? 
  that was more about `` post-scarcity economy '' and the danger of uncontrolled growth ( which in the end led to overpopulation in relation to society , rather than physical resources themselves ) but nevertheless a very interesting reading . 
   the only reason a nation should accept migrants , is if it needs them man , do you even see the very concept of free market ? 
  and it 's not about `` us '' and `` them '' . 
  they still can quite manage to find employment . 
  if it 's just about jobs being numerically limited then , we should start also to cut on births . 
  not to mention planning economy . 
  i 'm personally open about all this stuff , but if you want to reinvent the wheel , you should probably mention your premises .
