  you ca n't just pretend all these things are up to the state now , when they are n't even * real * at all . 
   and , with most of them , there are going to be huge cultural problems . 
  i ca n't understand if your problem is just with the simple existence of an `` asymmetry '' between foreign born and natives , which is indeed the only thing that i guess is never going to go away ( and that would n't make sense because it 's not the actual relevant factor ) , or with its ** magnitude ** . 
  which is what you have definitively to look at when trying to assess the amount of * downsides * . 
  and my point , from my anecdotes and from eurostat data above , is that this is not `` madness level '' . 
   slippery slopes towards what ? 
  slippery slope in this alleged link between x nationality and y misbehavior . 
   their arrival brings only negatives with them   i could make an exception for small groups that are most likely to integrate , like the discriminate white people in south africa sorry , did n't you just say there was no room for other people because it 's just about downsides ? 
  and again , on which ground these assumptions ? 
  what about chinese ? 
  or argentinians ? 
  and why this is again about refugees now ? 
  ... can you see it 's exactly this kind of * fuck them all * attitude that ** really ** fuck it ? 
  again , if you deem somebody damaging then no shit , you ai n't letting him enter . 
  but your criteria are all big slippery slopes . 
  and i still ca n't understand why we are discussing about this , when the crimes in the op have been comitted by algerians and moroccans . 
  your problem is with the whole legal economical migration then ? 
  so what 's stopping this non sequitur from including even , say , iranians or thai or whatever ? 
  what about muslims coming from usa ? 
  and what about christians with libyan nationality ? 
  can you see there 's no way for any kind of logical legal framework ? 
  on which criteria ? 
  nationality ? 
  religion ? 
  language ? 
  every one seems lame tbh . 
  wickedness is in one 's mind . 
  blood has nothing to do with this . 
  and i should probably remember you precrimes are unconstitutional under most jurisdictions . 
   cologne is a sign of what happens when too many of them are in one place which is the same thing i could say of organized crime when too many mafia associates reunite in one place . 
  so , what ? 
  should i just try to prosecute them for their misbehaviors or should i call for a referendum to drop the whole sicily out of the state ? 
  and can you please explain how the fuck this is related to aforementioned cologne aggression ? 
  we all know world is not perfect and we are still far from it . 
  the stupid reasoning on the other hand comes from taking ridiculously small samples and making up universal conclusions . 
  be them positive or negative . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/migrant_integration_statistics this is something objectively accurate for example , if you get me . 
  and what i see ( as you 'd expect ) is foreign born people having a lower income and higher criminality rates generally . 
  am i frightened ? 
  no , because i know it 's stupid idealism to expect everything but ** exact ** equality is dichotomously a defeat . 
  either you have perfection or it 's a complete shit . 
  and i know it 's pure scaremongering to profess that . 
  this does n't even make sense . 
  why the hell you should induce a bloody macroscopic trend from 60 morons over millions and millions ? 
   without pride there 's no impetus for decisive action , or a will to make things better . 
  says who ? 
  people = meps in a rapresentative democracy you know . 
  as i replied below , i guess the stupid dichotomy is on the contrariety of `` easiness of friendship '' . 
  the opposite is `` difficulty of friendship '' , not `` easiness of hate '' . 
   just read latin american history , look at how the u.s. `` shaped '' politics in countries like in chile and guatemala where they either started a war or orchestrated a coup to put their own guy in oh cmon . 
  can we stop to pretend politics during cold war has anything to do with politics today ? 
  us was shit . 
  and russia ( you omitted ) was shit . 
  back to our times , i do n't remember when the former annexed another country . 
   a similar langauge leads to better communication , which makes trade easier , etc. 
  definitively . 
  but that can be a reason for easiness to be `` friendly '' . 
  but difficulty of friendship is n't the same of easiness of hate . 
  everything seems simpler if you reason like world began in 2010 . 
   i mean , great britain still has the commonwealth of states . 
  that 's more of an economical alliance , rather than political . 
  which i mean , it 's the same existed between russia and ukraine , no shit . 
  then ukraine wanted to be lovely even with its west and russia says no fuck you . 
  which in your similitude is like uk telling canada it can not * also * ally with us or china or japan . 
   pan slavism definitely has a history of being associated with russian imperialism , but do n't try and associate people seeing similarities rather than differences as filthy pan slavism . 
  you do n't need to have a similar language or similar cheekbones to be friendly with people . 
  depending on your definition of excuse , which is the op question , that might count . 
  also , did you even read that ? 
  that , believe or not , one can even rape in good faith . 
  care to link ? 
  because i mean , since i do n't see any sane people on this continent gifting hoses and cars . . why they still have n't left ? 
  wow . . 
  so you are paying other countries money you could pay your own citizens ? 
  and that would be a strong and hard reaction . 
   it works [ no ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/31/stopping-the-boats-a-fiction-as-australia-grows-ever-more-isolationist-on-asylum ) , it [ does n't ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34654629 ) . 
  which guess whose wallets ends in ? 
   i guess it would pretty much end up like libya , with isis as a bonus . 
  it already is like libya with isis as bonus , if you mean it 's a pretty bad place to live in . 
   you said `` then the scum will do x , y , z. '', 
  the scum , which still refers to the conditional premises in the start . 
  which substantive should i have referred ? 
  those people that i still had n't data about ? 
   you chose to refer to `` these people '' as some sub-human category . 
  that 's scum definition , which i took from the message above . 
  personally if it was just for me i 'd have said morons , but given the very opaque proprieties of the aforementioned adjective , i hoped nobody would have given a damn , considering it can be applied to almost everything . 
   iran by that definition would be a `` democracy '' - since people vote in bs elections for a guy pre-selected by an imam . 
  sorry , i meant vote and get voted . 
  you are right indeed . 
  ( to sum it up )  a democracy is a state in which opposition parties are allowed to form , and to campaign , without any disadvantages or walls put in their way . 
  state tv banning parties from a public forum of discussion undermines that . 
  i just dream a better world where i wo n't have to hear people believing in chemtrails and vaxxers or other magical shit speaking with fallacies and all , with nobody that can rebut them because `` oh , but you ca n't criticize me '' . 
  besides this ( that 's about the contents actually ) , it 's the method the true cancer . 
  apply the same conspiracy madness you usually found with `` big pharma '' to politics , and you get a `` banks stole our money ! '', 
  or a `` putin is our only savior '' nut . 
  because , with all my good will , i can even start to discuss and all , but if you even make 2 +2 = 10 because reasons , i 'm off . 
   further , you seem to live in an imaginary world where making it appropriate to `` ban people for their methods '' will not result in the establishment enforcing bans on political opposition . 
  are you under the impression that `` the left '' are paragons of virtue ? 
  as someone who identifies firmly to the left - they are not . 
  i do n't know what the hell afd does , i already said . 
  i was referring to my country situation .
