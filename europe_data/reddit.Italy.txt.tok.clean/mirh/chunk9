  it 's pretty bad , and i can tell you there are all kinds of hoaxes . 
  if afd is * fine * , i 'm * fine * . 
   dude you are referring to a group of people you do not know as `` scum '' due to their political leanings . 
  no , i did n't . 
  i said `` if x , then y '' . 
  i did n't say if x was or not . 
  i do n't follow german politics and i hoped people could just stick with the bare abstract reasoning . 
   especially in a democracy . 
  democracy means the people have to vote . 
  the word you are looking for is free state perhaps . 
   if you believe only the party you yourself support should be allowed a forum to speak and a means to be elected i do n't believe . 
  and i swear you damn have n't read last sentence . 
  i told you the conditions i see this would have sense . 
  if afd members are cool , no problem then . 
  but people seems to have mixed feelings on it afaik . 
  the point is , tv is no such place as reddit . 
  you can tell all the bullshit you want , and nobody can definitively rebut you , because you call for proofs and refuse to admit you are a moron and all . 
  now , i do n't actually know how afd members uses to talk , but if they are even half as bad as we get in every talk shows here , it will be shit all over the place . 
  you can even have economists or philosophers or whatever intriguingly debating , then the scum will bring on some argument ad popoulum or argumentum ad nauseam and things go down hill . 
  in the end , you should n't ban them for * ideas * , but for * methods * , if any . 
  seriously ? 
  that was already screwed by economical situation . 
  i know a lot of people that this summer called of their bookings due to euro fear and all . 
  `` richest '' ... 
  it 's not like we are talking of greece vs luxemburg ( similar comparison would be ok with southern regions though ) . 
  and in general , the whole northern italy is as rich as germany . 
  i do n't see any special influence . 
  * why ?

  happy ? 
  unfortunately italy has n't rape data , but i hope sexual assaults one can be enough . 
  and they are freakingly among the lowest . 
  that 's why statistics exists in the first place . 
  hard data does n't mean 100 % certain , just objectively quantifiable . 
  you know , if you do n't like anecdotes , then find hard data . 
  he definitively has the best party out there , indeed . 
  it 's just that some butthurt does n't understand what compromise has to mean in politic . 
  oh , definitively . 
  though , strictly legally speaking negligence is n't a valid reason . 
  and this time it would n't be different from all those times us or urss mistook each other planes , if it just was n't for russia denialism . 
  yes , definitively . 
  though they at least had balls to admit they fucked up . 
  that would be the point . 
  yes , definitively . 
  though i ca n't avoid to consider how no sane person would expect equipment that costs as much as 10 m1a1 tanks to be assigned to newbs . 
  this has been clarified [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3zcznq/mh17_crash_dutch_investigators_to_assess_new/cylk6mp?context=3 ) . 
  the launcher has indeed its own iff but for some goddamn reason it is n't enabled in autonomous mode . 
  said this : | [ sukhoi su-25m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_su-25#specifications_.28su-25.2fsu-25k.2c_late_production.29 ) | [ boeing 777-200er ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_777#specifications ) --------- | ---------- | ---------- ** altitude ** | 7 km ( max possible ) | 10 km ( effective ) ** wing span ** | 14 m | 61 m enough is enough ? 
  somewhat clarified [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3zcznq/mh17_crash_dutch_investigators_to_assess_new/cylk6mp?context=3 ) . 
  the launcher has its own iff but for some goddamn speed reason it is n't enabled in autonomous mode . 
  said this altitude and radar signature are still two unavoidable information . 
  it 's not like radar could n't even be deployed in that russian base near the russian border . 
  though i guess we 'll never have some conclusive proof . 
  in which case , anyway all the other conditions of this context still stand . 
  and again , cargo planes are something , boeing 777 are another . 
  ok , i see the thing now after much jerking [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mh17/comments/2blxwn/buk_missile_system_lethal_but_undiscriminating/cj7kvm1 ) . 
  buk launcher does have iff but it is disabled when entering autonomous mode ( because reasons ) . 
  so that was our problem . 
  *** whatever the more information is *** , the point is iff is also present on the standalone unit . 
  #so a su-25 is n't the same thing . 
  the radar does n't need to be standing in front of the launcher , and i remembered there were allegations of its use ( though i must say at the moment i ca n't find any source ) nevertheless this does n't matter even . 
   a telar operating on its own ( not with the snow drift radar ) ** does have ** * iff * and nctr as well . 
  the onboard computer argon-15 is connected with iff and nctr modules and provide info about target . 
   without iff permission target can not be locked and a missile can not be fired . 
  however the commander can overrule and press a button so a missile will be launched , even if iff says it is friendly aircraft .

   note the image at 1:41 , a black screen with a few dots on it . 
  that 's all there is to see for a standalone buk . 
    [ soviet-era air defense systems as the buk are equipped with iff ( identify friend or foe ) systems meaning that they are able to detect if the system is targeting a civilian plane through its transponder code . 
  ] ( http://theaviationist.com/2014/07/20/inside-buk-telar-images/ ) even if it was just points , there is a lot of information that single entity can carry ( like in color , size , blink frequency ), 
  ohh , right . . [ a dot ] ( https://twitter.com/abunin/status/490100518807957504/photo/1 ) !, 
  it must be some kind of space invaders, 
  a multivehicle multiantenna multimillion dollars sam that is n't able to monitor something that has been practice in aviation for the last half century ? 
  except you know , if the transponder tells everybody in this hemisphere `` hey guys !, 
  i 'm a civil airplane , i 'm here '' it 's a bit more difficult to confuse it . 
  not to mention i ca n't see cargo planes using commercial flight corridors . 
  if you take into account this , and you consider even 10km can matter for fuel , it was n't unreasonable . 
  if i had to see police as some greedy and corrupted moral wasteland of rude assholes , certainly i would hold my tongue . 
  but personally , * in my country * most of men are there to serve . 
  so , assuming nobody of us is going to be a transgressor , i do n't see reason not to cooperate . 
  afaik if you attack a boat on international waters you are indeed attacking its country citizens on that specific country `` soil '' . 
  do n't know of there 's a corresponding law for aviation . 
  i just want somebody starting from the ( wrong ? ), 
  argument to say somebody is an asshole , not viceversa . 
  yes , in this case there 's even something else i guess . 
  i just wanted to point him out * where * public leads to defeat . 
  i believe it may have something to do with 50 years of iron curtain which ideally pushed for this feeling . 
  it 's not like , regardless , it would n't be better to focus on whatever the hell he wrote . 
  public agency driven by scientific needs **  ** private company driven by profit **  ** public agency driven by politicians with a for profit agenda driven by previously mentioned private companies -- the fact spacex created a resuable rocket has nothing to do with its private nature . 
   ` immigrants immensely help the economy ' to ` they are a mediocre burden on welfare systems ' . 
  this is another straw man . 
  if you want to imply i was saying it 's an help , no i repeat i did n't . 
  if you are generically referring to people on the other hand , i 'd try to point my index finder to the word refugee on the vocabulary , which is not the same of immigrant worker .
