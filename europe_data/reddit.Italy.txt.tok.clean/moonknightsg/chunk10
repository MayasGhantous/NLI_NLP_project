  it 's not a battle , france is only trying to resist the german expansionism , but they can not expand into germany without ruining their flag . 
  the vertical tricolor design is showing its limits . 
  well , pesto can be made with different ingredients . 
  the green sauce is specifically called `` genoese pesto '' , but there are variances, 
   `` we can argue with france , germany and britain , but never with america , '' said another senior government official , who was not authorized to talk to the media . 
  `` we will do with trump what we always do ( with the americans ) ; find a way to get along with him . '', 
  what a bunch of useless servants . 
  what you say is true , but you will never find wood pulp in real parmesan , it 's a fresh product . 
  i admit that i also thought that my honey was `` expired '' when i saw the crystallization . 
  we need food education . 
  yes , it certainly does n't rank 120 there . 
  but also switzerland ranking higher than italy in food affordability smells like bullshit , honestly . 
  but we also are n't free from industrial bullcrap . 
  for example , i have in my fridge , right not , a pesto that is made with sunflower oil instead of olive oil . 
  and the fact that something is regulated does n't mean it is 100 % safe , because the manufacturer can still try to scam the consumer . 
  it is illegal and can lead to fines or to arrests , but it can still happen . 
  if you want real pesto , it is better to search for [ handcrafted products ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9bnpdkp4su&amp;ab_channel=lineagolosa ) , or do it by yourself . 
  industrial stuff is not to be trusted . 
  a very interesting video , which highlights the problem with capitalism . 
  food should be managed exclusively by the state . 
  entrepreneurs will never care about health and food safety if there is the possibility to increase profit by using shitty practices and selling fake stuff . 
  raise your luck to level 10 . 
  apparently they were from kosovo . 
  this is disgusting . 
  is it true that mt. 
  athos can not be visited by women ? 
   alexander the great was greek , get over it slavic macedonia, 
  ugh , kotaku is cancer . 
  i the interview at eurogamer , sapkowski said he was stupid in refusing a percentage of cdp profits and selling the rights entirely . 
  but , the popularity of the games also helped his books in reaching an audience outside of poland , so ... 
  since when a gay is incapacitated from pulling a trigger ? 
  it 's old , but it is a really good documentary . 
  but his original name is nikola tesla . 
  name and surname end with an `` a '' , so he was clearly italian . 
   genocide or `` push out all the opportunists who tried to grab a piece of turkey '' ? 
  the armenians were a scapegoat for the failure in the battle of sarikamish , for which enver pashal was responsible . 
   can you really say you have done everything in your power to improve your own society ? 
  yes , because i have no power outside of signing a box for a political vote every 4-5 years . 
  and that vote still does n't matter if taken individually . 
  that would certainly make more sense . 
   hell , it is the democracy . 
  no it is n't . 
  and we are n't true democracies either . 
  the individual has no responsibility over a political election because the decision is made by the collectivity as a whole . 
  and the majority actually voted for clinton . 
  but the electoral system can change only when there is a political will to make the change ( meaning that the politicians actively work to do that ) , the citizens can do nothing other than creating noises in the street and maybe getting beated by the police in the process ( and yes , that happens in europe ) . 
  would n't that be bad enough , now a powerless individual must also be shamed by foreign strangers with a superiority complex ? 
  been there done that , and it 's not fair . 
   the lombard kingdom what in the actual fuck ? 
  the lombards came after justinian . 
  [ i do n't think so ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kgl5i/berlusconi_calls_german_chancellor_merkel_an/ ), 
  yeah , it does n't work like that . 
  clinton had the majority of votes . 
  ( not that she was much better , bernie sanders should have won ), 
  kinda like django unchained :d, 
  wow , so edgy . 
  i. . i do n't get the joke, 
  unless you want to get more debt , you have to subtract the money from somewhere to spend them on the military . 
  we need to spend money in infrastructures , education , healthcare , industry . 
  not on military . 
  it 's not a tool for liberation . 
  they feel better when they are covered because they are sexually and socially oppressed . 
  they are taught those social rules and dress code since the first years of their life , and no amount of education will change that . 
  because the ones who enforce those rules do n't want it to change . 
  you can not be tollerant to the intollerance , because the latter will always prevail . 
  and tollerance is not an european value . 
  enlightenment is . 
  women wearing hijabs is not integration . 
  they are brainwashed . 
   so what does it mean ? 
  constantinople was used until ww1, 
  i 'm kinda sure that the map refers to the percentage of people who travel abroad . 
   it is safe to assume that caucasian is what is referred to . 
  but , even that makes little sense , ethiopians are caucasians . 
  [ she looks white to me ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kidhbkkb5-i/v2qoya88dgi/aaaaaaaaa7u/ciibkgf_vu0l04rlqpfhulj8xr1sn9maqclcb/s1600/list-of-best-japanese-girl-names.jpg ), 
  if rajoy does n't speak a word of english , he certainly could n't apologize in a polite manner to the journalist . 
  are n't asians ... white ? 
  yeah , bbc should n't really expect others to speak in english . 
  what the fuck is this ? 
  no you ca n't . 
  we can not drop them in malta without their permission , and we can not ( or could n't ) drop them in lybia because it was/is not considered a safe country . 
  what ? 
  yeah , so we can get fined and criticized for human right infringements . 
  [ last time it did n't went too well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tragedy_of_otranto ), 
  neither am i :( we are brothers in poverty :d, 
  that depends . 
  are you rich ? 
   enable border controls which is something that should not exist because ... you know ... schengen ? 
  you have actually suspended that because of  big influx of persons seeking international protection , all borders , focus on land borders with italy , hungary , slovenia and slovakia https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/reintroduction-border-control/docs/ms_notifications_-_reintroduction_of_border_control_en.pdf  how many more refugees should we take ? 
  how many of them have you actually taken ?

  have you already forgotten that wall/fence you wanted ( i am not sure if you 've actually done that ) to build between our borders ? 
  lol , this is rich coming from austria, 
  `` the empire '' refers to the hre . 
  `` kingdom of italy '' is accurate . 
  well ... she 's hot . 
  the worst offender in ubisoft game design is the tower mechanics . 
  they created that in assassin 's creed , they expanded it in ac brotherhood ( where you had conquer different parts of rome by burning the towers ) , and then they basically made a copy - paste of that in all of their open worlds , first with far cry 3 and then watch dogs 1 ( and in watch dogs 1 that tower mechanic was excruciatingly bad ) . 
  yep , it 's the standard ubisoft open world game that seems to be made in an assembly line . 
  same old , same old .
