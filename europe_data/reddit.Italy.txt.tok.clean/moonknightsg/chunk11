  you should learn to respect other people 's culture . 
   in fact making coffee using these is n't rocket science eh , you still have to set them up , with the coffee bean at the right pressure , and be sure the water reaches the right temperature . 
  it seems easy , but it is not . 
  this is why 2 different bar with the same espresso machine can make two different coffee, 
  and now starbucks is going to flood milan with shitty black water :(, 
   espresso which is ... coffee, 
  that set is awesome . 
  is it possible to buy it somewhere ? 
  kinda . 
  it 's espresso + milk foam . 
  it 's not coffee , it 's a fucking cappuccino .

  the most used subreddit is r/italy, 
   reading comments - ( e.g. 
  il fatto quotidiano ) w-why do you hate yourself so much ? 
   the thing that strikes me the most about these comments is the anger about germany , and this has changed fast . 
  yes , a lot people hate germany , that much is certain . 
  and if not , they surely hate merkel . 
  [ there was a time this was different ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johann_friedrich_overbeck#/media/file:friedrich_overbeck_008.jpg ) , but from the stuff that happened in ww2 and the growing power of germany in europe to what is perceived to be at our expenses has changed that . 
  not really , but it is making me realize that facebook comment sections are trash and the comments i read makes me want to purge the entire country . 
  there is a very undeground fascist right-wing way of thinking that apparently is expanding really fast , expecially among the lower classes . 
  does n't matter what 's your opinion about gypsies . 
  doing what they did , dehumanize another human being and treat them as animal is nothing different from the process that led to stuff like auschwitz . 
  really ? 
   i clarified that loanwords are n't illegitimate and , from a linguistic standpoint , you are totally right . 
  the nationalist fringe of our country is almost at the same time likely to associate itself with fascism , so it 's not easy to separate the one from the other . 
  spoiler : ceasar was an asshole . 
   ahh . 
  its just they have the exact same sentence on a bf1 loading screen . 
  seriously ? 
  i know they were helped by the guys who make the great war series on youtube , maybe it 's their influence ( cause they also pointed that out in an episode ) . 
   someone plays battlefield 1 . 
  nah , battlefield 1 is for casuals . 
  verdun is better . 
   also ( if i remember correctly from history class in school ) the british had vowed to protect the independence of belgium so were duty bound to intervene . 
  they actually did the right thing here . 
  and i did n't say they were wrong . 
  but i actually find interesting the fact that they did to greece ( more or less ) what germany did to belgium because it is a great summary of the great war . 
  in the span of 1 year every moral standing was thrown out of the window and everyone tried to do whatever was necessary to win the war . 
  it highlights the transition between the victorian/napoleonic warfare and the modern war . 
  the two systems were not exactly the same . 
  lol , why are you taking my comment so serious ? 
  i 'm not some kind of expert on pizza just because i happen to be born in italy . 
  eat what you like if you like it and damn who say you are wrong . 
   and then the menu is usually 20 different options yeah , same thing , maybe even more than 20 in some places . 
   just interested to see how far we 've come from the origins of this marvelous meal . 
  uhm , personally speaking , i do n't really see a fruit going well with a piece of bread . 
  i grew up with the fact that fruit is always separate from the main course , always eated at the end of a meal , so having first course and fruit all together turns me off big time . 
  for the same reason i would never fill a sandwich with a banana . 
  but that 's me . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfrsvtsy0d4&amp;ab_channel=lindybeige ), 
  they entered ww1 because germany violated belgium neutrality for reasons of military strategy , but then they violated greece neutrality for the same reason . 
  why did no one ever thought of this ? 
  that 's beautiful . 
   they even look at boudicca as some sort of hero because she raided and killed about 100k people - that 's supposed to be ok because they were `` romans '' , but most `` romans '' were in fact british subject to roman rule . 
  basically she was the originally brexiter if i recall correctly , it was the reinassance period that brought boudicca to her `` today '' status . 
  an heorine fighting the good impossible fight against the superior forces of an evil empire . 
  if you think about it , it 's a good material for an epic story . 
  in reality she was a bitchy idiot who could n't win a battle in which she had around 80.000 / 100.000 combatants ( dio claims they where 230.000 but that is bullshit ) against 10.000 soldiers . 
   free speech what the fuck ? 
  mallock is free to compare the eu to the soviet union and he 's free to wish to be part of its destruction . 
  this does n't mean he has the right to be accepted as ambassador . 
  i said it before , but i will say it again . 
  the one who created this anti-vaxxers bullshit must pay for it . 
  no amount of free speech can justify the damages he has done . 
  nay , the true and only descendants of the vikings , the icelanders , have spoken , and that 's that . 
  you must be under the effect of shakira law to say something like this . 
   i never ~ ~ new ~ ~ knew heresy was supposed to taste so good . 
  fixed . 
  sadly i ca n't fix your tastes . 
  he 's the hero we deserve . 
  i grew up watching this . 
  saccottino . 
  lesser of two evils ? 
  san marino had a perfectly democratic communist government and nothing happened . 
  a fascist dictatorship is not the lesser of two evils . 
  you are saying you are not warmongers ? 
  so ... only france ? 
   provide ammo when europe runs out , or provide air transport for european forces . 
  you do n't `` provide '' . 
  you sell that stuff . 
  you make profit out of it . 
  and in what conflicts are we involved in which the u.s. is n't ? 
   does n't have to do things for europe such as ? 
  this is a bad map . 
  the vikings never settled in south italy , but the normans . 
  the house of hauteville , specifically . 
  true , but it is n't sweet . 
  yes , you 're right , my bad . 
  if you order only `` bianca '' then it is without anything , the toppings must be specified . 
  so `` bianca con ( with ) '' the toppings you want . 
   neither is pizza bianca wait , why is that ? 
  bianca or `` white '' only means that it lacks tomato , not that it lacks every topping whatsoever . 
  i mean ... fruit with bread ... it is n't really inspiring . 
  why are you speaking spanish ? 
  they 've learned nothing from us . 
  it does n't really seems hygienic . 
  the smugglers actually opened fire , what the fuck .
