  specifically , you should look at second punic war and how hyppocrates and epicydes , who were working for carthage , used `` populism '' to turn syracuse against rome . 
  syracuse . 
  skinning the apple before eating it is just basic civilization . 
  the developers have said they did n't do any research . 
  the level design planning was already done by the time they were in greece . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.polygon.com/2013/2/8/3959776/arma-3-bohemia-interactive-prison-ivan-buchta ) and apparently greek police is n't really doing a good job .

  arma 3 developers were arrested in greece [ for the same reason ] ( http://www.polygon.com/2013/2/8/3968814/arma-3-developers-arrested-for-spying-on-military-in-greece ) . 
  they fought very hard against the austrian empire . 
  there were also reprisals against serbian citizens because of their partisan guerrilla warfare , and many others died fleeing the country . 
  the article talks about the eurozone being a disaster for italy , not in general . 
  i voted yed , unfortunately . 
  they 're infidels who defied the holy teutonic order . 
  cause it 's a fucking conflict of interest ? 
  elizabeth will probably outlive him . 
  during that period , generally italians moved to lybia to work , not the other way around . 
  everyone shat their pants in both world wars . 
  how many countries did you invade between 1945 and 2016 ? 
  all this free trade and `` protection '' is benefiting you the most . 
  so stop whining like a bitch . 
  is this article legit ? 
  the dictator is coming . 
  ... dictator !, 
   illiterate peasant stock is n't this `` class discrimination '' ? 
  it 's contanti . 
  contante in the singular form . 
  i 've read that the word derives from the latin `` argentum computans '' . 
  we can also say `` moneta/e '' or `` soldi '', 
  ww1 was an attrition war . 
  italy was dependent on france and britain for food and raw materials . 
  a war against the allies would have been simply suicidal . 
   buffon uhm . 
   do you think italy joining the war with germany and austria would have changed the outcome of the war ? 
  nay . 
  lybia was not defendable , and italy was dependent on france and britain for food and raw materials . 
  which was the reason the italian army was not ready for ww2 , since they imposed sanctions after ethiopia . 
  italy would have bogged france down on the alps ... but lybia was a liabilty . 
  it was not `` pacified '' yet , and it was not possible for italy to defend it ( the dodecanese islands were also at risk ) . 
  france could have storm in from tunisia and together with the british empire would have open a front in southern italy . 
  like it happened in ww2 . 
  this is the most useless statistic ever . 
  the inside of the reggia di caserta was used as location for the palace of queen amidala in star wars i. 
  capua of today is not the ancient capua . 
  how would you feel if the americans will protest en masse against your next chancellor ? 
  nope . 
  by definition , the least bad thing is just better than the others . 
  but not necessarily good . 
  why do they feel entitled to protest against the president of another country ? 
   we will receive basic unconditional income . 
  that 's communism !, 
  poor kids . 
  i do n't know why it gets downvoted , it 's the best wine . 
   cultural issues wtf ? 
  [ i like this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lambrusco ), 
  the un means nohing . 
  you should restrain from calling something illegal if you can not enforce a punishment . 
  who decide if an invasion is illegal or not ? 
  a war is a war . 
  the vatican has recognised palestine . 
  god is angry . 
  good , a monarchist is really what europe needs to fight commmmmunism !! 1 !, 
   we are just waiting for the franz ferdinand moment so ... a casus belli ?

  [ germans ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/images/2012/06/11/153613337-1f910f92-e295-42ca-ad92-b982cb0022c2.jpg ) [ german women stereotypes ] ( http://static.qnm.it/845x0/www/qnm/it/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/stereotipi-sullitalia.jpg ) ( not what i expected ) [ swedes ] ( http://www.siciliainformazioni.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/svezia.png ), 
  is [ this ] ( http://www.legioix.org/tp-images/1uidbull.jpg ) legit ? 
  expecially with the [ rsi ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y2cnxy2axqi/maxresdefault.jpg ), 
  the swastika is also a very ancient symbol . 
  it was , for example , used by the [ etruscans ] ( https://vieilleeurope.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/659px-etruscan_pendant_with_swastika_symbols_bolsena_italy_700_bce_to_650_bce.jpg ) and other bronze age civilizations . 
   with terrorism who armed the mujaheddin ? 
  bring back the teutonic order !, 
  i know that france and uk were the ones to start that shitshow because they were in some kind of nostalgic phase . 
  but with them failing now lybia would still be a functional country instead of the mess it is now , with uk trying to gain control in cyrenaica and france to secure their interests in the sahel region . 
  at our expenses . 
  you might understand why this piss me off . 
  oh , yes , you went to somalia and iraq to defend europe . 
  so we are basically a client state ? 
  well , fuck it , i want my second amendment right now . 
   if we were to move the capital to rome better not . 
  trust me . 
   i 'm asking why we should have shut them down a long time ago . 
  because , if we take for granted that it was a measure against the ussr , then after its fall nato had no reasons to exist . 
  so far the nato has been used only for war of aggression , and not to defend a country under attack . 
  we have the biggest number of american bases after germany . 
  why ? 
  what bases do you think the us used to reach lybia ? 
   shutting down us bases in europe we should have done that a long time ago . 
  the us bases in europe has been used so far only to allow the us to reach north africa and the middle east . 
  great . 
  foreign military on another sovereign soil is never good . 
  the worst year in history . 
  damn frenchies . 
  and spanish . 
  and germans . 
  wait , we were talking about them taking the south tyroleans , not south tyrol . 
  they ca n't . 
   hatred of the jews everyone hated jews . 
  what got germany into trouble was to invade belgium two fucking times . 
  neither did the eastern europeans , since soviet russia was not communist .
