   i do n't see that from everyone trying to convince me on the immigration debate . 
  he 's ... not trying to convince you on the immigration debate . 
  he said that he will invest money in small enterprises founded by immigrants . 
  and of course  and any profits will go to fund programs at the open society foundations , including programs that benefit migrants and refugees . 
  the reason ? 
   our goal is to harness , for public good , the innovations that only the private sector can provide . 
  of course . 
  the point of his foundation is to strengthen the neoliberalist view that a social state is inefficient , and that the private money and foundations are a better alternative to the welfare state . 
  this guy needs to die as soon as possible . 
  do n't be sad , we took care of germany in that world cup .

  1 . a group of people who leave their native country to form in a new land a settlement subject to , or connected with , the parent nation . 
  2 . the country or district settled or colonized it 's not necessarily subjugation to a foreign country . 
  as a matter of fact , colonialism can also refer to the mere european expansion over extra-european territory . 
  overseas ? 
  you mean `` colony '' . 
  i definitely would not fuck with a guy like him . 
   britain as a `` source of evil and misery '' for the middle east well , the statement is not necessarily wrong . 
   italians are not stupid i respectfully disagree . 
  stop acting stupid . 
  i do n't necessarly disagree , but the us should have never thought of opening nato bases in crimea . 
  plus , why is ukraine so different ? 
  turkey has occupied the northern part of cyprus and no one moved a finger .

  this is better https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc0h8jjbdhe, 
  they do that in apulia . 
  so it 's irrelevant what the south vote for . 
  they will never vote in their interests . 
  then it wo n't . 
  but any fate is better than being tied with an other country where people think that the `` southern question '' is irreversible and things are bound to stay that way forever . 
  the south also voted for the monarchy . 
  we ceased to be relevant since [ 1500 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_wars ),

  no , it 's only good for the north of the country .

  not true . 
  the ethimology of the name romania comes from the latin adjective `` romanus '' . 
  conflict is in the human nature . 
  we just need to stay the fuck out of there . 
  and let their history take its course .
