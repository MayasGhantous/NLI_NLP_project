  to avoid repeating the mistake you did after ww1 ? 
  you do n't submit other nations with economy . 
  do n't be rude , mate . 
   letting ethnic cleansing appen right in front of your eyes and doing nothing that 's not fair , the netherlands opposed a great resistance against germany . 
  but germany was just superior . 
  crisis of the third century . 
  the capital of the roman empire moves from rome to milan . 
  constantine ends the persecutions towards the christians . 
  the capital is moved from milan to ravenna . 
  the migration waves , kickstarted by the huns , comes to italy . 
  the visigoth sacked rome 410 ad . 
  later , the vandals get possesion of sicily and sardinia , and sacked rome in 455 . 
  the last emperor got deposed and odoacre managed to become the ostrogothic king of italy , governing as a client of the eastern roman emperor . 
  justinian then decided that he had enough of the ostrogoth , and sent belisarius to retake the peninsula . 
  after 14 years from the end of the gothic wars , the eastern romans was forced to face a new migration . 
  the longobards . 
  the gothic wars left the territory devastated , and the longobards had easy life to conquer most of it . 
   well european countries are largely responsible for the problems that arose in the middle east and africa during the 1900 's . 
  no , these countries were not better . 
  africa was a shithole since before the colonization . 
  meanwhile , the bbc seems more busy in trying to represents ancient romans , celts and british noblemen as [ black ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ziv096d.png ) . 
  yes . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  the malvines were occupied by argentina who took them from the spanish empire , in 1820 . 
  you came later , in 1833 . 
   99 % of falklanders wanted to be part of britain well , no shit , they are british colonizers that you settled there after having kicked the argentinians out . 
  you 're thinking of crassus . 
  this is not a `` sabotage '' , it 's a scam . 
  where is corsica ? 
  we must be ready for global warming . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but the rising sun was the war flag of japan , not the imperial one . 
  how is this better suited for askeurope ? 
   against which part of the workforce would they compete ? 
  agriculture and construction . 
   it 's called `` libertarianism '' actually it 's called `` liberalism '' in its originary meaning . 
  so basically germans and french conspiration intensifies, 
   totalitarian leftist state . 
  there 's nothing leftist in favouring mass immigration to kickstart wage deflation . 
   it would be suicide . 
  if they start shooting at us , i do n't see any other reasonable option , because a retreat would make al serraj look very very weak . 
  i do n't like talking about stuff like this because i 'm not in the military and do n't have competences about military stuff , but honestly , if you think that way we might as well disband the folgore . 
  [ his son does n't ] ( http://www.libyanexpress.com/saif-al-islam-gaddafi-italy-looks-to-libya-with-a-fascist-eye/ ) i feel kinda feel libya is going to unify under an anti-italian coalition if they keep pushing that narrative . 
  cold war ii, 
  i 'll try to translate it when i have some time . 
   unless you are willing to militarily engage , and get ready for own casualties but i do n't believe haftar is that stupid , he ca n't start a war against us and win . 
  oh , yes , in fact i believe people like amerigo vespucci or vasco da gama to be better navigators , but still , the enterprise remains . 
  a bit like penicillin . 
   he was basically a conspiracy theorist that got really lucky that is kinda unfair . 
  navigating through the atlantic ocean at the end of the xv century is no small feat . 
  actually there are phone records about them `` reassuring '' the traffickers saying that they will never cooperate with rome , and we also know that they resupplied in malta to avoid entering italian waters . 
  no , this is proof of cooperation between the german ngo ( to which the iuventa boat belongs ) and libyan traffickers . 
  yes , it was taken by an undercovered officer , according to some newspaper . 
  on the left `` rescue boat from iuventa '' on the center `` migrants '' on the right `` traffickers '', 
  uhm ... try here . 
  they took 10.000 $ per activist , they had multiple contacts with traffickers were they said they will never cooperate with rome , they resupplied in malta in order to not enter italian waters . 
  they are criminals . 
  yeah ... [ a lot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aerolinee_itavia_flight_870 ), 
  you should have translate the title . 
  not that i know ... why are you interested in that specific organization ? 
  they refused to sign our code with some bullshit excuse , but that is n't proof of anything . 
  msf is not mentioned , this is about a german ngo, 
   saving people from life-threatening situations which does n't happen , because they get handled to the ngos directly from the traffickers in libyan waters . 
   do n't count your chickens before they hatch , i guess ? 
  that article is from may . 
   not only because it 's the right thing is it ? 
  in europe most of them will be exploited as prostitutes and underpaid agricultural worker , others will beg on the street and others will sell drugs , like some do near my university , while the traffickers in libya ( and the ngos ) get more and more money . 
  this immigration model is n't really sustainable . 
  you wanted to kill him in 1980 , so ... no . 
  not in this one , no . 
  it 's written on [ this ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/08/02/news/migranti_codice_ong_in_vigore_fermata_nave_in_mare_per_controlli-172151820/?ref=rhpplf-bh-i0-c8-p2-s2.5-t1 ) they have phone records . 
  you would n't talk like that if it was bulgaria . 
  having your rights of sovereignity state and your border violated with impunity is not good . 
  judging from [ this article ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/08/02/news/migranti_codice_ong_in_vigore_fermata_nave_in_mare_per_controlli-172151820/?ref=rhpplf-bh-i0-c8-p1-s1.8-t1 ) they seem to have some proof now , they continued the investigation and apparently they even have undercovered agents on ngos ship . 
  this is big , finally there is proof of the connection between ongs and traffickers . 
  when i click on the link it 's in english . 
   at this time the ngos objective is less about preventing people from drowning and more about preventing people from being ferried back to libya . 
  the police has also seized a german ngo boat today because they were in contact with the traffickers . 
  you should return to school , because soundly beaten does n't apply to germany in ww1, 
   who 's the greatest man of your country you are sexist !, 
  what the fuck is this trash ? 
   do you think only nazis were slaughtering innocent people and fighting for great reich ? 
  martin gilbert thinks that . 
  he states that the standard german army did not partake in the atrocities against the poles , that was done mostly by the ss . 
   maybe unless that nato member was the us . 
  naah , not even in that case . 
  they simply could n't sustain the expenses ( the costs of their intervention in iraq was insane ), 
   they knew they would be backed by ussr they were n't really backed by the ussr tho , only by china . 
  at least that is what i read on wikipedia . 
  but yes , although both koreas were puppets , the southern one was not in a good shape . 
  did n't have a real army and the us was actually retiring its forces ( iirc ) when nk attacked . 
   then there is the fact that italian diplomats where totally bypassed and were n't even consulted or informed of this decision , while for some reasons british ones were , which does not exactly inspire a lot of trust and does n't suggest respect from across the alps , it certainly is not in tone with the european spirit macron basks in . 
   yes they were in favour of a unified germany under a communist puppet government . 
  well , it 's not that the americans and british wanted you to be free . 
  was n't britain `` concerned '' about the reunification ? 
  no , before the chinese intervention they almost occupied all of south korea and pushed back the few us forces stationed there . 
  the chinese intervened way later , when the us led coalition almost reached pyongyang . 
  i thought it was a terrorist attack . 
  well nk wss almost succesfull . 
  wtf that is sick, 
   conflict over africa in the late 1800s til,
