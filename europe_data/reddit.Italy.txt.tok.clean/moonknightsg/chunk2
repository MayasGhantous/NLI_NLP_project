  was it really that surprising that we were group winners ? 
  maybe you are right , but it 's not my fault if a great chunk of the world population is so stupid to use certain terms to indicate something totally unrelated . 
  it would be like if i define myself as communist and then my economic ideas are to privitize everything . 
  i could call myself communist as much as i want , but that wo n't be true because my ideas define me as something else . 
   out of curiosity , what would you say italians ' key feature would be ? 
  there is n't one .

  left-wing and globalist in the same sentence is really dumb . 
  globalism is right-wing by definition . 
  sometimes . 
  every ethnicity has some key facial feature that set them apart from the orhers . 
  but there is n't a clear divide line and in a country you would find different ethnicity living together . 
  will you publish the results ? 
  this is going out of hand .

  i need sugar in the morning . 
  that breakfast sounds like a launch to me . 
  ah , calatia , where i live . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lepanto ah , the old times . 
   if portugal were demanding investigations of russian/syrian war crimes , the demand would carry more weight than it does coming from the us it 's ... different . 
  the us did n't ratify the rome treaty , and actively refused to recognize the sovereignity of the icc during and after bush jr. presidency . 
  plus , after bush admitted the use of waterboarding and got away with it , to demand an investigation on russia seems , forgive me , quite hypocritical, 
   what happened to the spirit of europe ? 
  why are we letting lousy politicians and their political errors divide us , the peoples of europe ? 
  it 's good point . 
  and while for sure eu is n't europe ... the union is probably a way bigger reality than europe itself . 
  what happens in the union affects all of us , and seeing a nation complaining and leaving because of `` muh immigrants '' , is n't exactly great . 
  though , maybe i 'm blind to it , but i have n't seen any hate regarding the uk . 
  actually not , we study of geography only in the first year in high school . 
  does that even exist on this planet ? 
   \u2212 42.2 \u00b0 c i. . . could die at that temperature . 
  stupid question . 
  is it that cold in moscow ? 
  i 've never like them . 
  stability means nothing to the people . 
  it definetly means nothing to me . 
  the fascist period was very fucking stable , you know , mussolini was in power for ... how much , 20 years ? 
  the problem is not stability . 
  the problem is having , in position of power , people who do n't care about the commong folk or the country itself , but only about their pockets . 
  or old people who are completely out of touch with reality . 
  oh , i do n't know , i 'm so disgusted by the italian politics of the last 40 years that i just want to start a war we can not win and be conquered by germany . 
  at least things will get a bit more efficient . 
  make hre great again !, 
  yes . 
  it 's uninspired . 
  really . 
  all of it it 's blue ... with yellow start to for a circle . 
  it fucking sucks .

  til making videogames is an hobby . 
  i still have n't seen a real competitor this year , even among aaa games . 
  if i remember correctly , cd projekt did not only distribute games in poland , but they also made translations and repackage with some exclusive content . 
  slavic/nordic folklore , for the most part . 
  1 ) `` the italians are rich '' i have nothing to say about this statement if not that who said this has probably some kind of special brain damage , considering that our wages are way lower than average in western europe . 
  2 ) i 'm pretty sure that you ca n't just let a bank fail without huge economic consequences . 
  yeah , that 's the most stupid idea i 've ever heard . 
  i believe there 's a european program for european projects ( so basically cd projekt took advantage of it ) , though 150.000 $ for a videogame is n't much . 
  what the fuck does it mean ? 
  it basically says that 4chan is a site for right-wing ultra nationalists . 
   they proved we are capable of colonizing other worlds no , that 's pretty much impossible . 
  a theft is a theft , the value of the stolen items change nothing . 
  driveless cars are the one of the most stupid idea ever .

  uhm , sky will make a coverage on his news channel . 
  i do n't know what other tv channels will do . 
  mamma . 
  mama is spanish . 
  how is this even calculated ? 
  i do n't recall recent italian leaders encouraging people to beat communist on the street and imprisoning political opposition , while trying to control and organize the private life of every citizen , can you enlighten me ? 
  i do n't know what that means , but no , it 's just logic . 
  you are using the fascism argument to point out that i can not talk about churchill ( while ignoring a bit chunk of that historical period , by the way ) . 
  which is not correct . 
  because when i say that churchill was n't a saint , i do not imply that he was worse than hitler and mussolini , or that they were better , nor that the kingdom of italy holded the moral high ground in that time period . 
  you know , there 's a difference between saying that the russians put the most effort into the war and saying that they won the war single handedly ( and i did n't say that ) . 
  stalingrad was indubitably the turning point of the war . 
  after stalingrad , nazi armies were on retreat , and after the battle of kursk ( which was before the opening of the western front with the capture of normandy ) they were definetly shattered and on rout . 
   not to mention that the soviets did n't liberate your country from fascism , that was britain , the united states and canada . 
  fascism ? 
  the fascist party was already disbanded and mussolini imprisoned after the armistice in 1943 . 
  the war in italy was mostly against nazigerman forces and what remained of the fascist loyalist .
