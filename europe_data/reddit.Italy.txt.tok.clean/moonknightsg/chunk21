  and germany was there , as one of the main contributor of troops . 
  that is 2015 . 
   islam is actually a religion of peace no , it 's not . 
  islam is a religion for warriors . 
  it needed to be that way and only because of that they managed to keep europe in check for the duration middle ages . 
  people also say that it is antisemitic to be opposed to israel . 
  you should ignore those idiots . 
  so now islamic terrorism is to be considered normal ? 
  and how many of these kids will now have ptsd and be scared for life ? 
  say what you want , but terrorism has won . 
  [ make america great ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/23/in-1927-fox-news-service-filmed-benito-mussolini-telling-immigrants-to-make-america-great/?utm_term=.d64f9235896d ), 
  lol wtf, 
  yeah , i read that a couple of time because apparently that article is somehow popular , but it is also wrong . 
   and it 's a weird one . 
  `` mozzarella '' becomes something like `` mutzadell . '' `` ricotta '' becomes `` ree-goat . '' `` prosciutto '' becomes `` pruh-zhoot . '' there is a mangling of the language in an instantly identifiable way : final syllables are deleted , certain consonants are swapped with others , certain vowels are mutated in certain places . 
  this is basically the pronunciation of naepolitan ( with a wrong spelling , btw . 
  `` mutzadell '' does n't exist . 
  `` muzzarella '' with the final vowel not pronunciated would be better ) . 
  and gabigool and capicola do not exist . 
  it is coppa , with regional variances in capicollo or capocollo . 
  this `` gabigool '' is a very wrong way of spelling the phonetic pronunciation of capicollo in naepolitan . 
  but the point is , the article is wrong because it says that nj is protecting an italian dialect , that actually is still pretty much alive , by using some loanword . 
   piemontese ( i think that 's the root of most modern italian , no ? ), 
  no , it 's tuscan . 
  uh ... no . 
  it probably comes from the greek `` andragath\u00eda '', 
  well , their economic growth is impressive . 
  i 'm suggesting that they must vaccinate their children if they want to sent them to the public school . 
  you put your child at great health risk without any reason . 
  this can happen to your child . 
  you know , i might be wrong , but i do n't think we have homeschooling . 
  elementary school , middle school and high school are obligatory . 
  kindergarten is not obligatory , so the kid can stay at home , i guess . 
  ( until 6 years old ) . 
  one thing i do n't understand is ... if a parent does n't send his kid to kindergarten and does n't vaccinate him ... can he then send him to elementary school ? 
  mushrooms and ... ? 
  they will not be admitted to school , right ? 
  there was a topic about this some days ago , but the law was still not approved . 
  now it seems it is . 
   they must be doing something right . 
  high wages . 
  well , that would never happen , we live in appartments . 
  orwell was a genius . 
   i did not know there was a real difference between obese and overweight . 
  well ... it 's even worse than what you believed then . 
  i. . . i do n't . 
  do n't make me doubt of my certainties . 
  masturbate at night , when everyone is sleeping . 
   my mum is about to kick me out and i 'm 18 wtf ? 
  so ... this is how people moved to the british isles ? 
  tea and vea could be represented by black actresses , though . 
  it would make sense . 
  but the elves are white . 
  you ca n't be racist against whites . 
  the `` card collection '' was a replacement for the lack of sex cutscenes , which was not possible with the aurora engine . 
  and yet , that was the witcher 1 , not 3 . 
  their review of that scene with triss and of the bloody baron multiquest is filled with errors and bias . 
  the actual review is worse . 
  so it 's like the french `` putain '', 
   and the ultimate insult for him comes from the `` fans '' that come to him to compliment on how well he novelized the games . 
  well ... honestly i would n't take it well either . 
  everything is dubbed in italy . 
  and will smith in the role of vilgefortz . 
  wait , i 'm an idiot . 
  i was thinking about asylums . 
  naaah , he just does n't like games . 
  and he 's salty as fuck because he sold the rights entirely because he thought the games were n't going to be a success . 
   ( italian ) women have mustaches wat, 
  wait , so it is official ? 
  you still have psychiatric clinics ? 
  capitalism , baby . 
  [ he met charles ] ( http://www1.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/prince+charles+silvio+berlusconi+prince+wales+wrxhh-fyzwgl.jpg ), 
  so ... the tory party is more ruthless than the nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei ? 
  good to know . 
  it 's like `` alt-right '' . 
  what a bizarre synonymous for `` nazifascist '' . 
   basically the issue you 're pointing out has to do with wealth accumulation and not capitalism in general . 
  yeah , but wealth accumulation is a problem derived by capitalism , is it not ? 
  which , in a free market regime , is a problem because you can not compete on this with someone who has way more money than you . 
   nobody is entitled to a job , it is n't a right by virtue of citizenship , that 's not how a capitalist system works . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_to_work and the capitalist system does n't work . 
  i thought it was clear by now . 
  it makes everyone poorer , except for a minority who gets richer . 
  it must be undone . 
   if eastern europeans can do it , the french can too what did they do , exactly ? 
  they emigrated to richer countries , worked for lower wages than the natives ( thus creating unfair competition in the labour market ) and sent the money back home to their family . 
  french can not do that , because there is not a richer country than france in europe . 
  no one will ever hire a 50 years old or older metalworker when there is a pool of unemployeed young people ( mostly immgrants ) who can do the same job for a fraction of the wages . 
  emigration ? 
  they are french , where exactly should they emigrate ? 
  to eastern europe ? 
  lmao, 
  [ you should send someone better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sxzn_ylji4&amp;ab_channel=bucksttabu ), 
   find a new job at 50 years old ? 
  lol  or emigrate . 
  emigrate to do what ? 
  and with what money ? 
  i ca n't believe people upvoted you . 
   it leaves germany and italy as the only major powers left in the union , making the power very lopsided . 
  axis intensified,
