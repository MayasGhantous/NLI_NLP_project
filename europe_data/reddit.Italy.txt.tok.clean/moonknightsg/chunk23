  like , when there 's a poll about who has the bigger dongs in europe , and france is always high in stats ... that 's the reason . 
  not really . 
  the legend about romans having troyan ancestry existed already centuries before virgil , in the greek world . 
   unfairly and overly judged by their appearance uhm ... no , that 's not how it works . 
  it 's just plain and simple sexual selection . 
  a fat girl ( or a fat man , for what is worth ) is simply not desirable . 
  we expelled jihadists from kosovo some weeks ago . 
  that 's retarded . 
  they do n't want more muslim recruits , they want to do what the christians did to the roman empire and what they tried to do since the middle ages . 
  to convert us to islam . 
  this is russian propaganda ... ? 
  uhm , someone has seen vox . 
   ~ ~ their was ~ ~ there was, 
   ~ ~ there country ~ ~ their country fixed ? 
  the government fuck up and the parents are the ones to pay ? 
  always said ireland is going to conquer europe . 
   ~ ~ it 's money ~ ~ its money fixed, 
  this because they care about `` representation '' , not about actual rights . 
  you ca n't let constantinople to the bulgarian hordes . 
  you want to fight sexism by creating a gender segregated military unit ? 
  seriously ? 
  damn french, 
  exactly . 
  nah , i 've seen brits confusing `` their '' with `` they 're '' , so everything is permitted . 
   better than ~ ~ booth ~ ~ both fixed . 
  why is it green ? 
  but the year 1900 is also the 20th century, 
  also a few decades after the end of the american civil war and of the franco-prussian war . 
  the year she was born , 1899 was also the year when spain lost control of cuba , the hague saw its first peace conference and uk entered the second boer war . 
  it kinda makes you think about our perception of history . 
  maybe what happened before we were born ... is n't really that far beyond us . 
   would they have hit italy ? 
  probably , yes . 
  what did we ever do to them ? 
  the moon landing . 
  and when the east was richer than the west . 
  good times . 
  i surely hope to have no connections with you . 
  yeah , apparently we have the wrong eder . 
  i saw that . 
  it needs sources . 
  and i thought that 2006 burned with much more intensity , expecially because of the success of our secret agent , trezeguet . 
  it was a joke ... like , when everyone change the name of nikola tesla . 
  that needs proof . 
  is it ? 
  honestly , i believe france can preserve artistic and cultural works way better than us . 
  seeing what 's happening to pompeii or to the colosseum ( tourists carving their names into the walls ) , maybe it would be better if we give everything to france . 
  and why in the world would the eu ever decide to upset france , which has way more political weight than us ? 
   italy did give back the axum obelisk , for example . 
  because we lost the war . 
  win a war against france and maybe you can get back some piece of art . 
   you 're falling into the old trap of thinking that just because only the best survive the ages , that means the ones that we do n't know of were also grand . 
  i. . . my problem with modern art is the cultural difference from the older era . 
  art before was in big part craftsmanship , theory , physic . 
  now it appears everyone is entitled to be an artist , the only thing you have to do is throwing some paint on a blank canvas and say that that is the representation of you souls , or other similar crap . 
  meh , then we should give back a lot of stuff to egypt . 
  also , the mona lisa was brought to france by da vinci himself . 
  [ fix the car for the boys in green !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbbkebwdbyq&amp;ab_channel=ismailosman ), 
  so not a colony , but a mine . 
  oh , i can already see wars waged to get possession of these resources . 
   start building colony on the moon . 
  what for ? 
  the moon is a giant rock with no atmosphere and unprotected against the solar radiations . 
  it 's about integration , which is kinda of an `` hot topic '' at the moment . 
  so ... yes , it 's kinda relevant to europe . 
  sanders is centrist at best , it is n't even close to be a leftist . 
   north vietnam was a communist dictatorship with a goal to conquer the south ?? 
  with a goal to `` reunify '' the south , as it was supposed to be after the war against france . 
  the fact that it was a `` communist dictatorship '' is irrelevant , there 's nothing wrong in being commie . 
  and sure it is not an excuse to install a puppet state , divide a nation and then launching an invasion that would kill milion of civilians and cripple thousands with chemical weapons . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  they basically supported the dictator of south vietnam which went to power tanks to a rigged election , and defended south vietnam despite the fact that the partition after the indochina war was meant to be temporary . 
  l'uomo nero ( the black man ) . 
  it 's basically a boogeyman . 
  also germany , but i believe france is seen as the main rival . 
  even because ... minus exceptions , we almost always win against germany . 
  [ historia civilis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucv_vlhiwvbh_fr9vbeuiy-a?&amp;ab_channel=historiacivilis ), 
   come on , he kept faking fouls and insulted zidane . 
  that is standard , before the wc he was the most hated player in italy . 
  but i guess zidane knew that , he was n't smart in reacting to his provocations . 
   materazzi literally runs into malouda yes , but if you watch the [ replay ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6kw-tepv48&amp;ab_channel=triplemilan ) , it is debatable if there is a contact hard enough to push malouda on the ground . 
  to me it seems more akin to [ what grosso did against australia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs6wqt00gtc&amp;ab_channel=remymagy ) . 
  i guess it is for us like it would be for you to win the wc against the netherlands . 
  oh , yeah , his goal saved us . 
   fucking referee cheating like fuck . 
  i agree , the penalty to france was inexistent . 
   and seriously trezeguet learn to fucking shoot . 
  he trained at juventus with buffon , we was our secret agent . 
   zidane destroying buffon helps healing though . 
  [ totally ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoxrfu155m4&amp;ab_channel=jgv1 ), 
  winning the wc is awesome , winning it against france is priceless . 
  profiteroles and crepes, 
   and football for now . 
   the most important one . 
  for now . 
  well , last time a military action was set up to free hostages ( afghanistan , 2007 ) did n't went too well . 
  pasta . 
  not oil , but minerals . 
   trump vented to his national security team that the veterans told him forces from the north atlantic treaty organization have not been helpful , and he lamented that china is making money off of afghanistan 's estimated $ 1 trillion in rare minerals while american troops are fighting the war , officials said .
