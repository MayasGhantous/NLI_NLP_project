  trump expressed frustration that his advisers tasked with figuring out how the u.s. can help american businesses get rights to those minerals were moving too slowly , one official said . 
  we say `` in bocca al lupo '' which means `` in the wolf 's mouth '', 
   you battle these ideologies by fighting ignorance good luck .

  i do n't really like traditional folk music . 
  the only song that i like is [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcf9ohtama&amp;ab_channel=pelerinagedelarose ) , in [ griko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/griko_dialect ), 
  you are considered eastern european in italy . 
  the concept of center does n't really exist , there are only eastern and western . 
  ah , you 're right , i did n't read that . 
   it 's breaching international law . 
  what article ? 
   privatization itself is not a crime against international law . 
  i did n't mention war crimes , i mentioned that it was the reason for the invasion . 
   ok , but do n't you think this also could have also happened in any non-dictatorship independent iraq government ? 
  what do you mean ? 
   they do n't want a piece of land in afghanistan or iraq they do n't need a piece of land , they need what is below that land . 
  privatization of oil in favour of american companies is what happened in iraq right after the invasion . 
   invading , occupying and annexing a piece of another sovereign state like the falklands ? 
  or like india ? 
  sanctions are not done because a country does something `` bad '' . 
  that is just an excuse to damage a potential rival in geopolitic and economy . 
   i meant it like it originates from france eh , i do n't deny the `` frenchness '' of bugatti ... but even that would be wrong , alsace was part of germany when bugatti was founded . 
   bugatti bugatti is german now . 
  [ you forgot this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avinorhwudk&amp;ab_channel=godai75 ), 
   i think that the distrust is mostly on your side guys , really . 
  we actually like you quite a lot . 
  still ... that ethnic cleansing part after ww2 was a bit shitty . 
   future soldier o7, 
   but if you are going to have a prime minister be the real person in charge , why not have a monarch ? 
  because it 's the parliament who choose the president , which is ( in our case ) the head of the armed forces , the one who choose the prime minister according to the parliament , the president of the high council of the judiciary and other roles . 
  i 'm pretty sure that would be treason . 
  battle of lille . 
  40 000 french soldiers were completely surrounded by 110 000 german soldiers , yet they continued to fight as long as they could to allow the retreat of the bef and the rest of the french forces to dunkirk . 
  it 's ww2 propaganda . 
  the french were the heroes who allowed the brits to retreat , yet france role in the movie is downplayed in favour of a british centric view of the battle . 
   then is n't it also right to say we should n't view them positively via our modern lens ? 
  navigation and discovery are still values that we hold in high regard today . 
  and is also difficult to ignore the fact that the columbus voyage kickstarted a series of events that changed the history of the world dramatically . 
  while the negative view of columbus is about condemning a man for the setup of a work system in the european way of those times . 
  no one condemn hannibal , boudicca or ceasar for destroy villages and killing civilians . 
  why should it be different for columbus , who did way less than them ? 
   he can be viewed negatively for enslaving and wiping out the taino . 
  that if you are willing to hold one man responsible for a tragedy that happened in the spawn of 50 years and was mainly done by the conquistadores . 
  [ pesto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pesto ), 
  it is wrong to judge the actions of people from the 15th century using our 21th century values . 
  in the new world colombo only applied a system that was considered normal form the men of his time , such as the encomienda or serfdom . 
  he is still looked upon positively . 
  bad luck .

   mmh , a toss between france we are allied with france in what exactly ? 
  i shower every day . 
  every afternoon i go to walk for 1 and half hour/2 hours , so taking a shower afterwards is , well , necessary . 
  i doubt that 3x a day figure is correct , tho .

  most of the teachers are shite and what is taught in school is mostly useless , so the fact that it is mandatory is irrelevant . 
  most italians can not speak it anyway nor understand it at a more `` complex '' level . 
  if some poor illiterate immigrant from africa can put the eu in crisis with people closing borders and deploying soldiers , the union will not survive this century .

  i do n't understand the problem , really .

  not true , it is actually quite interesting , with a colorful cast . 
  the protagonists are dumb , that is the problem of the book . 
  what the fuck are you talking about , we lost the first war in ethiopia because france and russia supported them . 
  did not know 1936 was ww2 . 
   but true your colonial managing was sickening lol, 
  why should we be guilty about ww1 ? 
  no , what 's the point of turning it off ? 
  my mom was 28 and my father 33 . 
  lol no, 
  no , i hate liberal centrism . 
  i 'd say the best was [ craxi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bettino_craxi ) , despite the later charges for corruption and his later exile . 
  he had balls which he showed in the [ sigonella crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bettino_craxi#the_sigonella_crisis ) . 
  wikipedia only have an article in [ french ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/crise_de_sigonella ) and italian about the subject , tho . 
  worst is definetely [ silvio berlusconi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silvio_berlusconi ),

  honestly it 's a dumb question . 
  austria is rightfully italian . 
  everyone knows that . 
  and you are actually upvoted . 
  that 's nothing , i 've seen americans justify the nuclear bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki as a way to avoid to get more people killed on the front .

  ah , so the solution to improve healthcare in south italy is privatization and federalism .
