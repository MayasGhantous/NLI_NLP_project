  he 's catalan . 
  the house of aragon conquered the city , deported the original population and resettled alghero with pardoned catalan criminals . 
   ~ ~ good like ~ ~ good luck, 
  they will hold a refendum in october to ask for autonomy . 
  bah , south tyrol is irrilevant . 
  but ... but there are . 
   what veterans ? 
  wtf, 
  france would n't allow it . 
  catalonia is not a nation , nor a state . 
  [ the first battle of the piave river ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_battle_of_monte_grappa ) a successful defence , after the caporetto defeat , that severely reduced austrian and german combat power on that front . 
  that changed the war for us . 
  boh , i know almost nothing about single us states . 
  yes , of course . 
  i was born in 1993 . 
   having gorica not be divided would be really , really nice . 
  i agree . 
   also while trst is currently barely getting by , forgotten by italy , who has almost no need for it , it would thrive false . 
  trieste is from 2013 to 2016 the first italian port for entering goods . 
  it 's too violent . 
   how you germans oh no , you did n't . 
  the line between partisan and terrorist is very thin . 
  i believe it was common in the 50s, 
  if you read the second link , roma is also the name of a greek/roman goddess . 
  in english . 
  https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/roma https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roma_ ( mythology ), 
   roma culture  roma stop calling gypsies with that name . 
  yeah , i get that , but i really ca n't see the case where you do n't have olive oil or butter ( which are like standard ingredients in every kitchen in europe ) but you have ketchup . 
   on spaghetti if you do n't have anything else cause you ca n't use simple olive oil or butter , right ? 
  you must put fucking ketchup on it . 
  salt, 
  nope . 
  we never changed sides . 
  you have colonies in the america continent . 
  no one . 
   unofficial because it 's not in the constitution it 's a fascist symbol . 
  that was n't very nice, 
  yes , french and german in university . 
  it 's trash . 
  microsoft and apple are , for example , two strong brands , very popular and with a lot of capital , it 's impossible to compete with them . 
  and socks . 
  sandals . 
  i did n't know they also make chocolate cream . 
  uhm , i buy the marmalade of this brand , but i 've never tried the nocciolata . 
  what 's wrong with palm oil ? 
  novi ? 
  well , they probably are . 
  yeah , so lucky beating germany 2-0 and taking only 1 goal ( in the final , on a penalty that should have never been given ) . 
  discovery , indipendence , civil war , world wars , cold war , gulf war ( if there 's time left , it is very rare ) i do n't remember if we study lincoln and slavery . 
   lock look, 
   well , as you 're a woman you absolutely must love fashion , so i 'd say ~ ~ paris ~ ~ milan .

   ~ ~ ( `` the older '' ) ~ ~ ( `` the elder '' ), 
   also napoleon was sicilian , not french . 
   / r/sas is a cancer of a subreddit . 
  allow me to disagree , i had my best laughs reading what is posted there . 
  i masturbate . 
   ah i thought it was a joke on the quality of modern italian cinema . 
  well , it kinda is , actually . 
  trash was surely a. . . popular genre back in the 70s/80s , but since than there has been an insane amount of annual copy & paste of the '' `` italian comedy '' '' . 
  movie that are trash ( non in a positive sense ) and always released on christmas . 
  there are times when something with quality still come out from italy ... like , ferzan \u00d6zpetek movies . 
  but it is not at the level of the french/italian co-productions of the 60s . 
  is `` trash '' a genre ? 
  https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/pizza_fritta_ ( gastronomia ), 
  i 'm saddened that nato and the un let the us free to do what the fuck they want every time . 
  the starting of the war would be another violation of the international law by the us , which would go , again , unpunished . 
  you know we have that in naples , right ? 
  no , i do n't think it is effective . 
  pizza . 
  uhm , is maple syrup american ? 
  i once ate pancake with maple syrup , and i really liked it , but the syrup is not so easy to find here . 
  [ it is really sad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq1ymey07xi&amp;ab_channel=eduardmakarchev ), 
  it would make no sense , gta is always been a parody of the american society filled with a ton of black humour . 
   did n't know call of juarez was european . 
  developed by the same devs who later did dying light . 
  the witcher 1,2,3 ( cd projekt red ) , grand theft auto v ( rockstar north ) , dishonored ( arkhane studios ) , mount & blade warband ( talewords enterteinment ), 
  [ those ones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_playing_cards ) , the neapolitan version ... which apparently is listed on this page as `` spanish suite '' . 
  you might want to study history again . 
   churchill did in ww2 . 
  us did n't join ww2 until pearl harbor , and it was mainly involved in the pacific theater . 
  when it joined the war in europe , russia was already mounting its offensive against germany . 
   and tried to take over the world actually mussolini 's goal was to take over french territory in africa ( and corsica ) and taking control of the hellenic peninsula . 
  taking over the world would have been a bit of a stretch . 
   but could n't even beat the africans what africans are you talking about ? 
  in ww2 we fought against the british empire in the african theater . 
  which includes australians , south africans and new zealanders , maori and indians . 
  better equipped and supported by the suez canal , while the italian troops where issued equipment not fitting for desert warfare , with cardboard boots and without a necessary water supply , forced to drink from the radiators , and with a fucked up chain of command . 
  and despite that they mounted a decent fight , inflicted decent damage ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raid_on_alexandria_ ( 1941 ) ) , [ were the first to deploy human torpedoes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_torpedo ) and the [ frogmen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frogman ) . 
  no shame in losing against them , and expecially in those conditions . 
   or the greeks well , you could n't beat half vietnam . 
  fuck ups happen . 
   and basically was a detriment to your allies ? 
  yeah , like the countless times that our soldiers died to cover their retreats . 
  funny , it was a unit of bersaglieri to break your lines in the battle of kasserine pass . 
  p.s - fuck you , you have me defending mussolini and his fascist party . 
  unbelievable, 
  no one has ever asked for american intervention so ... no , they are not `` damned if they do n't '' . 
  actually , it was started by the uk at the end of ww1 . 
  and they hate us .
