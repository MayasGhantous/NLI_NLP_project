  reaching a sort of agreement with lybia about migrants has been a huge diplomacy effort . 
  better not . 
  we have no connections with them . 
  yes , cause it 's fucking stupid and based on stereotypes . 
  being italian does n't make you a good cook , and being german does n't make you good at organizing stuff . 
  scrap this shit entirely . 
  they did it , actually . 
  it was resettled around 880 ce , so it would be 1137 years old . 
  i do n't count the old samnite-roman settlement that was there before ( viii century bc - ix century ce ) , because it was destroyed and resettled in multiple occasions ( second punic war , vandals , saracens etc. . . ) [ this a photo with my town below and the vesuvius in the background ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/mount_vesuvius%2c_capri_and_maddaloni.jpg/1920px-mount_vesuvius%2c_capri_and_maddaloni.jpg ) [ and i really think that norman ( ? ), 
  castle deserves a better fate ] ( http://www.checasamaddaloni.it/assets/images/work-2.jpg ), 
  nope , europe is europa , jupiter 's moon is europa . 
  no confusion . 
  being a name , europa ( jupiter 's moon ) is always capitalized . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  i thought they eat croissants for breakfast . 
  we do not wave our hands when we speak . 
  no , we are not arabs . 
  no , we do n't have black heritage . 
  not ... not yet , at least . 
  so ... like normal bread . 
  but you can freeze it and then put it in the oven at 180 \u00b0 . 
  which is ... totally true to what happen in the story the quote is from . 
  nay . 
  that part was in the witcher 3 cgi trailer , but the full transcription he quoted was from the story `` the lesser evil '' , where geralt then gets the name `` the butcher of blaviken '', 
   the spanish king is the one responsible for avoiding spain to turn into , well , italy . 
  what the fuck does that mean ? 
  you know , problem is ... authoritarianism is right wing . 
  an authoritarian left ca n't simply exist , because it would be right wing by definition . 
  ( and no , the urss was not communist . 
  as a matter of fact , it was n't even sovietic ), 
  the whole point of fascism was to stop communism , expecially after the [ biennio rosso ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biennio_rosso ) . 
  so ... it could n't be left wing . 
  yes , they do . 
  eh , i do n't know . 
  generally , if the action is the result of planning security and successful cooperation between countries , a pm might really want to point that out for pr reasons and to instill a sense of security into the people , after a terrorist attack . 
  by `` lying '' , if they actually lied , they made the germans look dumb ( because they believed he was still in berlin ) , the french look stupid and us look very very lucky . 
  they did n't know , tho . 
  they got suspicious because it was late at night and the guy was hanging around . 
  it was `` luck '' he got caught . 
  i mean , he traveled from germany to italy passing through france , and making them look stupid . 
  the reality is that ... is difficult being caught on purpose if no one recognize you . 
  i got stopped two times with my car for a check , and one time at naples train station for another check ( 1 police man and two soldiers ) . 
  it 's not unusual . 
  they might have a gdp similar to us , but they have oil , money , resources . 
  gdp is n't everything . 
  their army is big , and any war with russia would be , if not a world war , certainly the biggest european war after the napoleonic campaigns . 
  which means a lot of destruction . 
  and a lot of deaths . 
  not really popular . 
  the only times i 've heard of rugby were : 1 ) in university , when a girl i liked told me she liked rugby players because they have big arms , apparently . 
  2 ) when britain got mad at us for something our team did ( some weeks ago , maybe ), 
  i have dark hair . 
  it 's an extremely huge source of cringe . 
  taxes . 
  i 've never really understood the opposition in the usa , tho . 
  what you do n't pay in taxes , you pay in private health insurances . 
  which , often , is actually more than what you would pay in taxes with a public healthcare . 
  i think , and excuse my ignorance if what i 'm saying is bullshit , that the real opposition is about `` i do n't want to provide healthcare with my money to people who can not afford it '' . 
  but is n't that the point of modern states ? 
  to protect and care for the lowest classes of our societies ? 
  google chrome . 
  what 's the point of this question ? 
  yes , it is . 
  religion is not falsifiable , which is in total contrast with the scientific method . 
   so maybe we should just give people the individual freedom to believe what they want ? 
  there 's no way to prevent that , because you can not control people 's mind . 
  but there 's a way to control the power of religion . 
  and that is to ban it completely from the public life ( which means no tv coverage of religious events , no public fundings to the church , no religious symbols in public offices , priests banned from taking part in the political discourse and so on ) . 
  yes , religion is dangerous . 
  [ my favourite ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/hayez_meditazione_italia_1848.jpg ) she looks badass . 
   are n't they already independent ? 
  not in term of fiscal policies . 
  every state who adopted the euro has renounced to be indipendent in that matter . 
  what ? 
  do you have any idea how many states , cultures and ethnicities are in the african content ? 
  it 's impossible to have a single opinion about every people who live in there . 
  he was 15,35887 % florentine . 
   smoking is about one of the worst things you can do health as is drinking . 
  or eating nutella . 
  sadly the good things in life are also cause damaged to your health . 
  america or stati uniti ( united states ), 
  not one of the best tarantino movies , but one of christoph waltz 's best performances . 
  low quality bait , mate . 
  try again . 
  [ accademia della crusca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accademia_della_crusca ) but they also use a `` descriptive '' approach . 
  if a neologism or a loanword spread to a certain degree among the population , they make it an official word in the italian lexicon . 
  i 'm a smoker , and it 's viewed ... normal , i guess . 
  of course smoking is banned in public buildings and restaurants for obvoius reasons ( but you can smoke sitting at your table in a bar , if you are in the open ) , and you can not smoke near a pregnant woman . 
  but other than that , you can smoke as much as you like and no one dare to piss you off . 
  now i see , i searched on google and i found proof of concept . 
  it did n't make sense . 
  same lol, 
   poc i fucking swear you , you are obsessed with acronyms . 
  what does poc stand for ? 
  in italy schools are public institutions with public buildings , and public institutions must display the flag . 
   there 's a really reeeally salty guy on here who reports every post which has `` americanized '' grammar . 
  pack it in \u0ca0_\u0ca0 like ... [ this message ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xgitumj.png ) i received some time ago ? 
  he 's gold . 
  the preposition do/does before the subject in the interrogative form . 
  also , adding the suffix - s to a verb when conjugated to the third person singular .
