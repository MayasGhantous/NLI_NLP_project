  combat training . 
  when we had the mandatory military service , the number of conscripts was huge . 
  as such , the resources where not enough to give to the soldiers some quality training . 
  many of them would have left anyway . 
  in the nato mission in somalia we also sent some units of conscript . 
  many of them never shoot with a weapon before . 
  so , i do n't think it work in countries with a huge population . 
   it creates a large labor force and hence drives down the wages making it possible for companies to save a tremendous amount on wage costs . 
  yes , and it also increase the gap between the rich and poors . 
  i do n't give a shit about companies if they start to pay the worker less . 
  mandatory military service creates an army huge in number with a shitty training .

   our islands you 've occupied those islands in 1833, 
   for example the stereotypical italian accent in english adds vowel sounds to the end of words . 
  this is because almost all italian words end with a vowel sound . 
  or the pronunciation of the `` th '' sound .

   how about beach and bitch ?

  it is still english , but in the 5 years of high school we do english grammar in the first 2 years , then english literature ( from beowulf to orwell , more or less ) and history ( from the moment the romans left britannia and alfred the great to the 20th century ) . 
  but it sucks , because we basically studied it directly in english . 
  and for a teenager , with only two years of grammar , almost no reading comprehension skills in english , it 's not good . 
  it was basically just learning the thing exactly as it was written in the book and repeating it to the teacher in a very bad english .

   base 10 is not logical . 
  we use base 10 because our cavemen ancestors had 10 fingers . 
  you do n't have 10 fingers ? 
  and no , we use base 10 because it can be easily divided and multiplied by 10 . 
   base 12 is far more logical , by the way , since it 's the smallest number with four factors besides 1 and itself which makes it more easily divisible .

  war does n't settle differences . 
  war is a tool to establish superiority against another country , another monarch , another people . 
  through war you take over territory , resources , military power . 
  war is a tool to make your country stronger at the expenses of another . 
   what i am more curious about is how it seems to leave a bad taste in european mouths . 
  some of the other responses have kind of cleared that up . 
  our national identity is defined not only by our birthplace , but also by the society in which we grow up . 
  let 's take the case with the italian immigrants . 
  from the moment they departed and went to america ( us , canada , argentina ) they made different experiences that shaped their society and sub-culture in a different way . 
  in the us for example they found themself in a feud with the irish , they faced racial discrimination , they kinda manged , through multiple generations , to cilmb the social ladder , but they are still in a limbo where they are not considered fully americans . 
  but they are also not considered fully italians . 
  those are all experiences that shaped them differently from the italians in europe . 
  at the same time , the immigrants never experienced the years of lead ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/years_of_lead_ ( italy ) ) , the [ mafia war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_mafia_war ) and a lot of other things that shaped us differently from them . 
  african-americans , italian-americans , irish-americans ... for me they are meaningless definitions . 
  one can certainly be the grandson of a certain group of immigrants , but living in , i do n't know , let 's say new york , he/she went to school there , he/she have lived there for the entirety of your life . 
  that makes them , to my eyes , 100 % american .
