  french revolution and the napoleonic wars . 
  that would be wrong . 
  the mediterrean 's tides are very limited because there 's little connection with the atlantic , so it can not be considered an extention or part of it . 
   becouse because, 
  in a very illiterate form . 
  the state underwent a process of centralization similar to france , so the only standardized language , the one thaught in school , is italian . 
  the other languages are considerate dialects by the state , and since there 's almost no literary publication in those languages , i only know the spoken form of the `` dialect '' used in the region where i live . 
  but i ca n't write in that language , and i definitely do n't speak or understand the others . 
  i 'm learning french and german at university , and i will take swedish next year as third language . 
  the closest language to latin is actually sardinian . 
   in spanish , a macedonia is a fruit salad . 
  same in italian . 
  ireland , russia , sweden . 
  yes , but not about iq . 
  more about linguistic competencies , knowledge of your constitution and the legislative process , knowledge of history . 
  more like robots . 
  we do n't have a state religion , but the vatican has a lot of concessions and privilages , thanks to peace treaty signed between mussolini and the pope . 
  so stuff like the hour of religion in school with teachers designated by the vatican or having the crucifix hanged ovee the wall in public offices . 
  nowday is difficult to fight this , because common people do n't see the problem with secularism . 
  everytime the issue is brought up by the medias , people go full retard and automatically think it 's a way to appease immigrants or islamists . 
  the unjustified nationalism . 
  it looks like a way to compensate , it 's fucking ridicolous . 
  not that simple . 
  oh , sorry , i did n't read the `` poles of r/askeurope '' . 
  i thought you were asking in general . 
  i was during the berlusconi government ( s ) . 
  now i 'm not , but at the same time i really ca n't find anything to be proud of that happened after 1861 . 
  how is that possible if taiwan is not recognized as a country by the permanent members of the un security council ( usa included ) ? 
  china is one of the founding members of the un . 
  they have a constitution and the right to vote . 
  the difference with the `` west '' is that they are not a `` representative democracy '' . 
   it 's an awful dictatorship no , it 's fucking not . 
  no , it was n't . 
  it was a defensive pact , which also stated that , would have been changes in the balance of power in the balkans , we should have got compensation . 
  and austria was n't willing to do that . 
  it was a defensive pact . 
  this is a shameful gratuitous offence . 
  that 's not true . 
  well , he was always surrounded by the giants of the garde imp\u00e9riale . 
   short guy . 
  he was as tall as me . 
  he 's the turning point for european history . 
  everything he did changed the political and social structure of the european countries . 
  the bourbons tried to retake their thrones in france , spain , south italy and restoring the old order , but eventually the felt before the beginning of the 20th century ( except for spain , they restored them multiple times , the last after franco 's death ) . 
  in italy , history is taught from napoleon 's point of view , and waterloo is defined as a `` defeat '' . 
  one of our most important writers , [ alessandro manzoni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alessandro_manzoni ) ( 1785 - 1873 ) , also wrote a poem about him , the fifth of may . 
  but at the end , he failed . 
  waterloo was a battle he should have never fought , but he did it nonetheless . 
  is my understanding that the concept of white in the states is `` anglo-saxon protestant white '' . 
  this is why the irish and the italian immigrants were not considered white . 
  the concept of `` cultural appropriation '' is just dumb . 
  wait , is hotline miami a swedish game ? 
  [ they sent their best , though . 
  what about ... no man 's sky ? 
  too bad it has been put aside in the gaming scene by battlefield 1 . 
  verdun is better .

  dishonored best game ever . 
  [ and best ending to credits transition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im7tbrdferm&amp;t ), 
  he did what he could in impossible conditions . 
  it 's not up to me to judge him . 
  modern romans are not ancient romans . 
  what you are saying does n't make any fucking sense . 
  in that case , `` italian '' would still be wrong , since the other italic people also got conquered . 
  and they actually tried to create an italian league . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_war_ ( 91 % e2 % 80 % 9388_bc ), 
   do you consider it to be a part of your culture and heritage ? 
  they are the ones who came before , and i consider it as part of the heritage and culture of at least half of europe . 
  but then , you also have to consider that the national identities in europe have began to take shape during the middle age , sometimes even bumping up irrelevant historical events , like [ teutoburg forest ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmf3vba_rcm ) for the germans and [ boudica ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npwm2touf08 ) for the british . 
  so ... yes , i consider them part of my culture , as much as the ostrogoths ( well , maybe they were n't exactly relevant at the end ) , the eastern romans ( byzantines ) , of which there 's still [ something left alive ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcf9ohtama ) , the lombards , the normans , the arabs , the spanish and the french . 
  i knew this bullshit was coming . 
   a year later it would be switzerland annexing italy . 
  yes , please !, 
  [ nutella burger ] ( http://fortune.com/2016/11/14/mcdonalds-nutella-burger-italy/ ) apparently . 
  uhm . 
  you may be right , there was probably connivence from ratzinger towards the entire scandal . 
  i 've only been to spain ( valencia and barcelona ) and zakynthos , greece for [ cultural reasons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ugo_foscolo ), 
  that 's actually irrelevant , since it is not a crime committed by the state . 
  [ the massacres of perugia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1859_perugia_uprising ) would be much more relevant . 
  sadly the english page is shamefully lacking , the italian and the french pages have way more infos . 
  edit : oh , i found the article from the new york times http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9f00e3da1f31ee34bc4152dfb1668382649fde, 
  this stance is honestly modern , since both prussia and france had interests in defending the papal state in the 19th century . 
  garibaldi was against it , though . 
  [ the papacy , being the most harmful of all secret societies , ought to be abolished ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_peace_in_geneva ), 
   fuck us for allowing it to remain us ? 
  if you think about it , ceasar also was elected pope . 
  go away , you heathen !, 
  sardinia ? 
  i always have the impression that they are not different from the ancien regime nobility . 
  they are a bunch of rich people with the right connections and families who only care about their wealth , and they do n't give a fuck about the country . 
  why work when you can eat pandoro ? 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capture_of_rome ) is [ why ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_question ), 
  why should the president of spain speak fluent english ? 
  can theresa may speak fluent spanish ? 
   pasta with w\u00fcrstel on the other hand , this is an odd combination from an italian perspective . 
  how is it cooked ? 
  i think a standard sausage is a much better ingredient for a pasta dish , it has a stronger flavour . 
  these are [ wurst ] ( http://www.blitzquotidiano.it/wp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wurstel.jpg ) , right ? 
  wurstel and potatoes is mostly seen as a pizza for children , but i find it to be quite good . 
  sausages and [ rapini ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rapini ) is also a quite good combination .
