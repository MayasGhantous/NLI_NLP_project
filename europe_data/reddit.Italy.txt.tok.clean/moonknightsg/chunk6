  people too often forget that this rethoric was used against italians from the south less than 3 years ago . 
  forest camo is ugly . 
  i. . . i do n't like how this modern society is structured . 
  what the italian government is proposing is a structural change of part of our legislative system and constitution , while preserving the abhorrent electoral law that undermines the basis of the democracy . 
  this , from a government that has been slowly stripping away the workers from their rights , privatizing the shit out of everything and completely eliminating the welfare . 
  we have been impoverished year after year , the youth has no hope of living a life of dignity and despite this the economy is still shit . 
  this referendum will never pass . 
  i was just asking because it 's a common mistake to no re-apply the cream after the bath . 
  are you sure you applied the cream correctly ? 
  meaning , before and after the bath . 
  it 's how we dress , is n't it ? 
  it 's how we dress every summers since at least 1950 . 
  so it 's part of our culture . 
  if you do n't like your belly exposed , you can wear this http://www.onfancy.com/media/catalog/product/cache/9/image/294x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/g/y/gyxh24752onfancy.jpg, 
  so can i walk full naked in amsterdam ? 
  no , they should be force to integrate whithin the society , not create a parallel one when a woman is force to be full clothed on a beach . 
  and no , we humans have a lot less of free thinking than we like to believe . 
  those women might choose the burkini out of their free will , but only because they are conditioned by their families and friends . 
  problem is that you ca n't prosecute a crowd of people . 
   unless they wish to face the wrath of their family and friends so the response is to legitimize the oppression of these families and friends and their sexist radical culture ? 
  exactly . 
  not because of merit , only because uk has decided to gtfo . 
  they are just populist idiots . 
  you ca n't have a referendum on the euro without changing the constitution first . 
  i have to correct myself , i got confused with this . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archbasilica_of_st._john_lateran as for the old senate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curia_julia the door the building has now is a copy of the one that was `` transferred '' to the basilica . 
  cause the us have a bigger stick . 
  it would not be wise to consider it an act of war , the response needs to be more ... diplomatic . 
  for now . 
  i got the reference . 
  star wars , episode v. am i becoming american ? 
  the ruins you see in rome are there because the city evolved . 
  people over the centuries took a lot of material from the old roman stuff ( temples , colosseum etc. . . ) and build new things . 
  did you know that the saint peter basilica 's door was once the door of the roman senate ? 
  edit : it was not st. peter , it was this other basilica https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archbasilica_of_st._john_lateran, 
  it 's not a matter of education , it 's a matter of integration . 
  they are a `` nomadic '' people who does n't want to integrate with the society of the country they are living now . 
  they do n't have documents , this makes them almost untouchable . 
  most of them use this condition to live of crime . 
  not only petty crimes like scam or robbery , but child kidnapping and smuggling . 
  those are their living conditions http://www.blogncc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/campi-rom.jpg you can not integrate people who do n't want to be integrated , and at the same time this create ... cases of discrimination and racism among the native population . 
  roma people is n't exactly well seen in italy . 
  so it 's not different from the italian flag . 
  or do you think that the `` so called '' italians share the same culture or genetic history ? 
  it 's impossible to do anything about them , most of scammers and thieves are roma people ( at least in italy ) . 
  have n't you read the link you posted me ? 
  go , read what stalin did with religion in the urss . 
  but it fucking is . 
  uff , what the ussr have to do with religion now ? 
  aaah , religion , always the same . 
  it 's more than grammar , it 's logic . 
  it 's a difficult concept for me to express , but ... your native language shapes the way you think and interact with the world around you . 
  which means that learning a second language , or a third , is good 'cause it opens your mind , but at the same time , the more the language you are learning is different from your native one and its family , the more is difficult to learn it . 
  this can be shown in english vs russian , or english vs mandarin , but also in the differencies between a language of the italic family ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o140ni6yim ) or a language of the germanic family . 
  for example , despite the phonetic differencies i could easily learn french . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrlycvitave but god forgive me if i have to learn german , it would really be difficult for me . 
  the differencies in grammar bring along a series of logic problems . 
  to learn a language of a different family group , you need to overcome this logic barrier ( for example , in english you have verb - subject - complement in the interrogative form , but for me it 's totally illogic , the only form used in my language is subject - verb - complement , which means that i made a lot of mistakes with the interrogative form in english ) you need a lot of practice . 
  you basically need to learn to think in english , you have to learn to think like an english native speaker , which is not exactly easy . 
  and yeah , the spelling does n't help . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qafwtkepj80 get your shit together , uk . 
   english = easy language for you , maybe . 
  italy did n't join the union , though , it was a founding member . 
  it was the charme .

  what a waste of money . 
  if you vote based on a `` misinformed '' campaign ( like the rethoric about immigration , which would n't really change , cause uk has always had control over their borders ) you are ignorant by definition . 
  which is not an insult , by the way . 
  they are just filthy lombards . 
  like the good old times http://www.novinite.com/media/images/2009-08/photo_verybig_106604.jpg where are you silvio ? 
  i did n't say that there was a law in turkey that prohibites to eat pork . 
  i just point out that the secularism is equal to not prohibite to eat pork , which stands for the concept `` civic law '' should not be influenced by religion . 
  nope . 
  secularism = no law against eating pork . 
  you need a movie industry . 
  chinese culture and history is still not really well known in the west , and it 's kinda exotic , so it has a lot of potential . 
  spanish has a lot of native speakers . 
   not that many redheads in ireland though , it 's fairly exaggerated trip to ireland cancelled . 
  1.5 billions because france and uk wanted to play `` little imperialist '' in libya . 
  how the fuck is nk a socialist state if they have a dictator , no free press and people are starving ? 
  i 'll tell you again . 
  you can call yourself whatever you want . 
  fascist , socialist , democratic etc. . . but it 's what you believe in and how you act politically that defines you . 
  the fact that the state basically does n't care about you ? 
  that you have to pay a fortune to afford medical treatment if you are not covered by a medical insurance ? 
  that even if you have an insurance , the company might decide to not pay for your medical treatment ? 
  that most of the workers are treated like slaves , and a lot of people have to work 2 jobs to survive at the end of the month ? 
  the almost complete lack of regulations ? 
   which is what he promised if there 's something i learned in my 23 years of life , is the politicians in italy never keep their words about anything , and they never face the consequences of that . 
  i have n't seen any newspaper article explaining what the referendum is really about . 
  seriously . 
  if the media do n't educate the people about the content of the referendum , people will always vote against the establishment or based on a personal fucked up idea of what the referendum is . 
  no special kind . 
  that was tried by lenin and it worked pretty fucking well . 
  and yes , socialism has a place in xxi because capitalism alone is not sustainable . 
  universal healthcare , welfare , minimum wages are supposed to be basic rights , and the concept that the state has a responsibility to look after its own society it 's the way to go . 
  unless you want to be like the us . 
  and no , neither north korea nor cuba were socialists . 
  forgive me , but i 'm pretty sure that the urss was socialist ( or communist ) only by name . 
  what stalin did was basically only establish a fascist dictatorship , using the october revolution as excuse to legitimize it .
