the best way is to improve future generation 's abilities to create wealth : health , education , research , infrastructure , ... 
  but norway is investing into these things , precisely by spending the interest from their sovereign fund . 
  of course the quality of everything can be improved , but norway is already doing pretty nicely : - 11th best healthcare system in the world ( according to the who ) - 7th best un education index in the world - 4th place in numbers of scientific papers published ( normalized by population ), 
   me for instance , had to wait 3 months for an mri , after that 2 months for an x-ray . 
  meanwhile i got paid ( full salary ) to stay at home and do nothing . 
  wow , is n't there any sort of priority system ? 
  in italy the prescribing physician indicates a priority on the procedure and you are scheduled accordingly - for procedures marked urgent it 's a next day appointment . 
  italy : - ** berlusconi ** is still playing at ** threatening the government ** while taking on the role of the wise statesman : he makes a threat , then denies having made it , then one of his men makes a threat , then another denies they mean it and ensures his party 's full support for the government . 
  berlusconi 's time is running out since the senate committee that must declare his incompatibility with a senatorial seat meets in a few weeks . 
  - also , his lawyers have submitted an appeal to the ** european courts of human rights ** , arguing that he did n't get a fair trial . 
  - meanwhile , the ** oecd ** published its projections , showing that we are still deeply in recession and embarrassing the government which , not two weeks ago , had said `` we will be out of the recession by the end of the year '' . 
  - ** pope francis ** called for a day of fasting and prayer on saturday in response to the syria situation . 
  - members of parliament for the ** five stars movement ** have occupied the rooftop of montecitorio , the palace housing our chamber of deputies , to protest against constitutional reforms that are being pushed forward , in their view , without regard to established procedure . 
  what a load of crap . 
  you got people working for below minimum wage , people who are probably struggling to get enough hours at their jobs , most likely trying to cut back on expenses to afford what 's necessary , who are probably investing time trying to get better jobs , and what do you do ? 
  you give them mandatory job placement seminars , which subtract from the time they could dedicate to job hunting or work . 
  you give them `` tasks '' that steal more time from their already-long days . 
  and if they fail to work their job and do the government-mandated homework , you cut their benefits . 
  this is class warfare , pure and simple , trying to fuck poor people out of the pittance they get in government aid and make them suffer because their are poor . 
  `` pull yourself up by your bootstraps '' does n't work when the government pushes down on your head . 
  in case anyone 's wondering where the italian uproar is , i can say this . 
  it 's been known for decades that dell ` utri , berlusconi 's former right-hand man , had strong ties with the sicilian mafia . 
  it 's known with certainty that for years berlusconi hosted vittorio mangano , a mafia boss , in his personal villa , under the guise of a stable master , most likely so that mangano would provide protection to berlusconi and his family . 
  what this trial does is establish once and for all that dell ` utri did indeed deal with the mafia * on behalf of berlusconi * ( a detail which had n't been proven before ) . 
  italians have known the facts above for close to two decades know . 
  they 've voted for him regardless , because he owns the media , buys out opponents and has faced some of the weakest , most disorganized political opposition in the history of the country . 
  some people buy into his narrative that all accusations against him are false , slander crafted by leftist judges to stop the liberal revolution he 's supposed to be bringing . 
  others are not as naive , but see their interests align with business-friendly berlusconi more than anyone else . 
  and many , many people would * never * , ever vote left , so berlusconi 's center-right is the only alternative . 
  that he should not be voted for under any circumstance just does n't occur to a high percentage of my fellow countrymen . 
   these no seceding laws are moot anyway , what exactly would a government do if a region wants to leave , send in the army ? 
  yup . 
  following wwii there were two big items of concern regarding italy : - that the ( back then ) strong italian communist party might take over ( either legally or not ) and realign the country with moscow - that several peripheral regions of the country might secede , creating breakaway regions that would be unable to do their part in stopping a potential soviet attack to counter these foreseeable problems , two things were done : - the old institution of the carabinieri ( military police with civilian law enforcement duties ) was maintained and its command separated from that of ordinary law enforcement ( it answered to the defense ministry ) . 
  the carabinieri were supposed to be used to suppressed armed revolt and secession attempts . 
  - a secret paramilitary and intelligence organization called gladio was created to combat the influence of communism and act as the nucleus of a guerrilla resistance in case of communist takeover so yes , at least in italy we would very much send in the army . 
  i actually wrote a fairly successful short story about just that , you can find it in my comment history ( it 's the one gilded comment ) . 
  i do n't know of any treat we 've ratified that forbids that article , probably because we ca n't ratify treaties whose provisions are unconstitutional . 
  i do n't know about spain but , for example , the italian constitution also forbids any partition of the nation and the article that forbids that is in a group of articles that can not be struck or amended . 
   how big is the blocco studentesco ? 
  ( for those who do n't know , they are a fascist-aligned student union ) practically insignificant . 
  they hardly manage to elect one or two ( out of dozens ) representatives in most university student body elections and end up counting for nothing . 
  btw , quick recap of what shadow banking is . 
  traditional banking is a * heavily * regulated business . 
  there are strict requirements for banking institutions regarding what they can do with their money and what kind of information they have to report to regulatory agencies . 
  compared to other industries , banking is really tightly regulated . 
  enter the shadow banking system . 
  it 's composed of various entities - funds , private equity firms , various types of investment vehicles - that do a lot of the same things as banks ( like lend money to people , edge against risk , deal in mortgages ) but they use different contractual forms ( for example , derivatives ) that do n't fall under banking regulations . 
  they do n't fall under banking regulations because when those regulations were written these kinds of instruments did n't exist . 
  through the shadow banking system , financial operators can do a lot of things that they either ca n't do normally or that they ca n't do as easily with normal banking . 
  `` shadow '' does n't mean that it 's run by the mafia or the illuminati , it means that it 's not subject to the same very strict regulatory requirements of normal banks ( especially the same governmental oversight ) and thus operates `` in the shadow '' . 
  sure , that 's a possibility , but the eu still holds much , much less control over the internal affairs of its members than the ussr did . 
   so , the `` eurasian union '' would be a new soviet union ? 
  it 'd be a customs and trade union between the old soviet republics . 
  the soviet union held very tight federal control over its constituent republics ; this would be much more akin to the eea . 
  that 's about what i was going to say . 
  i agree with the principle , but europe just does n't have the political unity to decide collectively on a matter as sensitive as defense , yet . 
   not the growth trend but the actual values , that a more liberalised labour market means a faster adjustment . 
  the same counterarguments apply . 
   germany among other things has no minimum wage it has no * federal * minimum wage , but it very much has per-industry minimum wage . 
   by contrast , the usa has wage controls and its government is getting into massive debts with their deficit spending and their funding of wars , unlike germany . 
  not to mention that both countries are similar with regards to economic freedom . 
  so you agree with me that labor law is , by far , not the only factor affecting unemployment . 
   you ca n't look only at that , cuba also has no unemployment and yet it 's a shithole , you could even end unemployment by paying people to dig ditches and fill them back up however the problem is n't employment but productive employment and for that you need a liberalised economy . 
  maybe , but my point is that throwing out a couple of cherry-picked examples is no argument in favor of this position , because by the same cherry-picking process i can `` prove '' the exact opposite , and i have proven to you that i can . 
  i made my point , so for me this discussion is over . 
   not really so what was the correlation you were suggesting with  see any correlation ? 
   btw , how 's italy doing with its 12 % unemployment rate ? 
  portugal is at 16.5 % , spain at 26 % and greece at 28 % . . but i guess you may be right , thank fuck for the government regulation of the labour market !, 
  germany has a heavily regulated labor market and [ by law workers participate in the management of the company ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/codetermination_in_germany ) ( normally through trade union representatives ) . 
  its unemployment rate is 5.3 % . 
  by contrast , the extremely unregulated ( by comparison ) us has an unemployment rate of 7.6 % . 
  by your quick and unscrupulous logic , we should conclude that heavy german-style labor market regulation , with mandatory workers ' representation in the board of directors , is better for employment . 
  but the correct conclusion is , instead , that with statistics , if you pick and choose your sample you can prove anything and its opposite . 
  i guess he thinks that since in 2010 switzerland 's labor laws became more lax ( according to the first graph ) and , according to that same graph , switzerland 's unemployment started falling in january 2010 , then this proves that laxer labor laws correlate positively with falling unemployment . 
  beside the fact that such a correlation needs to be evaluated mathematically and i 'm not sure the result would be statistically significant , the argument is flawed from the beginning since a ) unemployment is also related to macroeconomic factors that need to be accounted for and b ) laxer labor laws can create employment by encouraging short term and dead-end jobs which , however , do not contribute to lasting economic prosperity . 
  also , [ switzerland 's economy ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/switzerland/gdp-growth ) received a very small hit by the crisis and recovered very quickly . 
  a 1 % unemployment variation both rising and falling could well be explained by the effects of the 2008 crisis and subsequent economic rebound . 
  ** in short ** : the only way to conclude anything regarding the connection between labor laws and unemployment is to already believe in a conclusion and ignore all contrary evidence and all alternative possibilities . 
  this needs to be asked : where is the proof of the fiscal feasibility of basic income ? 
  the faq section on the op 's site has the laughably bad `` question ''  we already know basic income is feasible . 
  why ask for new studies ? 
  well , it turns out i do n't know that . 
  so i checked the provided sources , which turned out to be congress papers from the `` basic income earth network '' . 
  i could not find a single independent paper published in a major economics publication . 
  so , again , where is the evidence that basic income is feasible ? 
  and , while we are at it , where is the evidence that is also * desirable * ( that is , that it 's preferable that public money be spent on basic income rather than alternative destinations ) ? 
  indeed . 
  europe needs to maintain its presence in the main tech industries and nokia was arguably the best of the last smartphone companies that remained here . 
  not only do we risk missing the opportunities for research and growth that might come from the smartphone market , but we now lack a strong european voice in global smartphone standards . 
  this might seem little , but when inevitably technological advancements will require new standards to be adopted , they will be negotiated between american and asian companies , with the european market as a passive afterthought . 
  i do n't see any justification for using german exclusively , especially on the tourist attraction signs . 
  germany is the first language in the province and it 's only just that it 'd also be the first language on the signs , but considering it 's a ) still a part of italy b ) home to a sizable minority of native italian speakers c ) a tourist destination many visitors of which speak italian , there really is no justification beside blind regionalism to ask for exclusively german signs . 
  the rest of italy is ( slowly ) translating tourist road signs into english to appeal to the majority language spoken or understood by its foreign visitors . 
  if everyone were to follow sud-tirol 's example , each region would have the signs in its own regional dialect ( dialects which , linguistically , are separate languages ) to comply with the local majority language . 
   but going down to 3 cents / min and 1.5 cents / mb would cut into the fundamentals of the market . 
  but those caps are on wholesale prices , correct ? 
  they are not necessarily related to final prices paid for by the consumer , which is where the industry gets its revenue . 
   on the other hand i ca n't help thinking that they 're unique resources that should n't be wasted on mere politics !, 
  they have little actual obligation to attend parliamentary works . 
  the idea is that when they feel it 's important they have a direct way to influence political decisions .
