  anyway no , percentage has a meaning if you take into consideration internal product too . 
  if you just whine that you 're less than 10 million and you have so many immigrants it sounds just like moaning . 
  also you 've already given yourself the explanation why sweden accepts so many immigrants , because you do n't ( still ) have enough low skill workers . 
  seriously , if the problem is costs then who is the racist ? 
  and it 's not italy 's fault if your state is giving money away to people that do n't know what to do with their lives . 
  seriously i 've seen gipsies asking for money in the streets while playing on their i-phones in gothenburg , the fuck is that ? 
  i 'll check that out  thanks for the invite !, 
  yeah . . maybe it 's you who should do some reading on eurostat . 
  sweden has the highest asylum applicants ** per million inhabitans ** . 
  it would be easier if it was possible to do statistics by ethnicity to get the real numbers . 
  anyway , the amount of immigrants in sweden is estimated to be 1.33 million , which is almost the number of romanians we have in italy . 
  then there 's the rest , and we get to about 4.5 million , with a net immigration ( 2008 ) of 47.000 a year against the 32.000 that ** applied ** for asylum in 2010 in sweden . 
  so what are you talking about ? 
  you are the one who should educate him/herself . 
  if you do calculations based on the percentage of immigrants in the population , you do n't get the real numbers . 
  the real numbers are what i 'm giving to you . 
  also , you 're not accused of violation of human rights when you do n't have the fucking space where to put the thousands of immigrants that arrive every single day by boat ... and do n't be so hypocritical ... your country is thriving thanks to the cheap manual labour . 
  dude i lost it when you said `` ah t ` es un couillon d'ricain ! '' ... 
  yes but did n't you notice how slowly but surely the ex-ussr countries are passing to the western side ? 
  the nato is slowly surrounding russia , that 's why putin is reacting like this . 
  but man , just to clarify , i 'm not pro-putin eh !, 
  i 'm just trying to understand and think with you what is going on , unfortunately there is nothing i can do as a person , other than voting . 
  well i was n't there when they signed it man . 
  i complain about it and i was complaining about it before , but this thing was signed by a not elected government , you remember ? 
  pm monti was put there as a transition president to organize new elections after berlusconi 's government went down ( thank god ) , and he ended up selling italy to the germans . 
  it basically was a golpe !, 
  there 's actually an investigation now going on about him and that `` government '' with the accusation of lese-majesty , if this is the word . . 
  i guess you understand though . 
  about austerity , of course it can be good but here we 've been in austerity since the 90s . 
  hell since i was born the only thing i heard on tv was `` new budget cuts signed by the government '' , i 'm not exagerating i 'm serious !, 
   and they always cut on education first , which is the dumbest thing you can do ... 
  well ... there is no prospectus for now . 
  they should try to promote some policies to restart the economy but the fiscal compact makes everything impossible . 
  how can you invest in something if you 're forced to cut 45 billions $ of expense a year ? 
  in the end , universities will start closing ... already 3 million businesses have failed and closed . 
  in my case , being a musician , in italy i 'd have `` know someone '' to get a job and be payed less than 4 times less of what i 'd get here in sweden , working less , too . 
  edit : i mean , i 'd love to see my country thriving and being awesome but the politicians are very corrupt , and the population is just . . not honest i guess . 
  it 's also true that both sides have been committing war crimes ... 
  i have a lithuanian/russian friend who 's relatives live in ukraine . 
  they are russian speaking and their house was marked with a mural saying `` russians here '' , one of her relatives has been stopped in the streets and asked to say `` vivat ukraine '' , he refused and got beaten . 
  the eu was wrong supporting timoshenko and now we ca n't say anything because we ca n't protect fascists like this, 
  yeah , that fiscal compact is the stupidest thing i 've ever heard . 
  it 's like `` hey the economy is stuck , let 's cut all the financial aid to research , schools , industry and small businesses so that the state 's papers will be ok '' . 
  since there 's no news about it on italian newspapers , apparently ... http://www.cgil.it/news/primopiano.aspx?id=22259 link is in italian but i can provide a translation if google is too bad . 
  they also changed president, 
  yes but more sanctions would n't do anything ... and if there was a serious threat of war against the nato then putin would die in an `` accident '' very fast . 
  also , i do n't think the nato is interested in risking a war with russia to protect moldova and ukraine , it 's very sad but nobody wants another world war . 
  good news !, 
  now what happens ? 
  yeah thanks for reminding me that on the internet everything you say is taken literally . 
  anyway , yeah i agree with you it 's going be harsh , for the whole eu if we do n't try to stop the retards of the bundesbank . 
  thank the lord renzi has had the balls to say `` we 're not taking orders from the german bank '' , praise the lord he 's been the first !, 
  where 's the uk and france now ? 
  i 'd give you gold if i had any . . but i 'm just a poor southern italian fleeing the country like a coward . 
  if you say that this is meaningless whining then you probably do n't know anything about economics and political science , fellow redditor . 
  i 'm not addressing all the fault to europe , you 're assuming things i did n't say . 
  what i am addressing is europe 's responsibility in italy 's situation . . if i had to explain all of the things that brung down the potential of this country i 'd have to write a freaking 500 pages book , of course , but it 's getting on my nerves ( actually not only my nerves but a whole bunch of italians ) being addressed as a * country in trouble * with that stinking upright attitude some other europeans have . 
  also this expression is getting real dark metaphoric connotations to it when pronounced by politicians , especially those coming from germanic countries . 
  with this new prime minister , expect italy to try ruin some people 's feast . . at least i hope renzi will have the balls to do so . 
  this sentence `` a country in trouble '' has such bad connotations to it that it makes me angry just reading it . 
  do you think we 're a country in trouble eh ? 
  and what about uk and germany , with more public debt than us ? 
  what about the fact that in germany there 's still no minimum wage and they 're allowed to use cheap labour coming from poland while we are forced to move fiat 's factories in romania ? 
  we 're not in trouble , we are being actively economically attacked by other eu countries who are using the european commission to produce regulations and sanctions that effectively hurt our economy . 
  for example , agricolture . 
  why has the eu ruled about size and shape of almost every vegetable and fruit available in the market ? 
  because this is helping holland 's greenhouses sell their shitty products that otherwise could n't compete with 1st class italian products . 
  we 've been forced to respect eu 's regulations about milk productions , forcing producers to throw away excess milk because it is illegal even to sell it to 3rd world countries . 
  same goes for oranges , been thrown under bulldozzers in sicily since the 90s . 
  if you want the answer , this is to keep the high price of certain products , using laws as a meaning of unfair competition . 
  what about school systems and the fact that the eu imposed reform is adapting italian standards to central eu standards of education , not because their schools were good , because our universities were producing too many good professionals . 
  i 'm living in sweden now and i 'm opening my eyes about the staggering difference in level in international students and italian students . 
  guess who is passing the most difficult exams , who is producing the best professionals that are forced to flee their country because the economy has stopped working ? 
  italians . 
  thank god our university teacher and department heads are fighting the reform in any way possible . 
  and i can go on for ages . 
  to some it up , of course we 're doing our own interest , just like all the other eu countries . 
  because this union is a joke and it 's been proven in the past 20 years if you had eyes to see . 
  now you just ca n't not see after the greek situation happened . 
  greece has been cut into pieces and sold to the best offer because merkel decided so . 
  it 's crystalline clear that the eu commission is following the agenda of the most powerful economy at the moment . 
  you can also look at other examples , like the fishing industry in the uk being destroyed by unfair competition from spain . 
  spain was flagged as a developing country and so was receiving 10 times more financial eu help for fishing than the uk . 
  if this does not make it clear to you , i do n't know what could do it . . 
  and instead you suggest to cut all medical equipment exports to russia , so they 'll be even angrier at us ? 
  that 's not how politics work dude , this is how you start violence . 
  finland also was a partner of the nazis . 
  sorry we 're not sweden 's bitch . 
  also , those `` rules '' have been voted by the majority of northern and germanic countries ... it 's too easy to have all the `` good '' immigrants and have us take care of the others and the incredible situation in which they arrive . 
  you have absolutely no idea on how things are here in italy , while i 'm living in sweden and , dude , you have very little immigrants to take care . 
  it does n't matter if on percentage they are a lot , the real numbers matter here and we in italy have an estimated number of 5 million immigrants . 
  that 's like asking us to take all of the finnish and find them legal jobs while you get the 1 % `` because you 're only 9,5 million '' . 
  god dammit sweden , stop being so naive . 
  benito mussolini so what ? 
  things change , it 's like saying that germans are still nazis and russians are communists . 
  is it ? 
  is it like this ? 
  i agree with you it 's sad that western governments are not totally against the russian regime but , as i said before , you 're an utopist if you rely on the western world for human rights and democracy . 
  we do n't have democracy , we just change regime every now and then and europe is actually just the usa 's bitch . 
  look , italy has 17 american bases on its territory plus other stationing troops in italian bases ( such as in the military airport of sigonella , often used to repair and maintain us drones ) , plus we 've banned use of every nuclear system but we 're forced to maintain over 90 us nukes here .
