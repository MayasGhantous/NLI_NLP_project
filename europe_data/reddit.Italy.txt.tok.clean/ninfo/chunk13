  the only fascist party in italy is casa pound and they have 0 . x %, 
  [ you can look at this map ] ( http://www.lastampa.it/italia/speciali/elezioni-politiche-2013/elezioni-2008#/c/2013-02-24/r/italy ) red = left blue = right ( berlusconi ) yellow = 5 star moviment ( grillo ) south italy is more traditional and conservative , central italy is the left stronghold . 
  northern italy is not traditional , but there is northern league ( a party allied with berlusconi ) . 
  he does n't want to leave euro . 
  he wants to do a referendum to let people decide . 
  no grillo is no more a clown . 
  he is one who formed a violent movement that reached 30 % in so little time . 
  you can make fun of him , but you should be worried . 
  and you are naive if you think this is only italian business . 
  what do you think of putin ? 
  what do you think obama or merkel or cameron think of putin ? 
  do you see them insult him ? 
  you should learn how diplomacy works . 
  ofc it is not ok . who say that ?? 
  when berlusconi said that it echoes a lot because it was something awful to say and i was ashamed to be rapresented by him . 
  still what steinbruck did was wrong . 
  no he is no more a comedian . 
  i thought this was obvious . 
  still there is somethign called diplomacy . 
  and ofc this came from germany . 
  unfortunatly we really need a massive amount of reforms . 
  northern league ? 
  they are not fascist , they just want to divide north from sud . 
  if you mean something else like a far right there is nothing like this now ( something like 0 . x % ) . 
  with fascists do you mean 5 star moviment ? 
  anyway no , the majority of one chamber is in the center left hand, 
  interesting from an asian or american point of view maybe . 
  i think it will be a drama . 
  how can you speak like this ? 
  do you have any idea how are they living ? 
  how much they already paid ? 
  and you are talking like greeks are all the same . 
  i 'm starting to think not only in italy there is television brainwash . 
  yes but this mean a definitive break between bersani and grillo . 
  well sure the new one can , but can we stay in this `` limbo '' for 2 months ? 
  i do n't think so, 
  the president of the republic ca n't calls new election because he is in the white-semester . 
  the president has many power but not now because he is in the white-semester ( the last six months of the 7 years ) . 
  in the last six mounths he can do very little , we have to elect a new one in 50days and you can understand this will be really hard with this fragmented parliament . 
  in one month we have premier/president/pope election . 
  italy is in chaos . 
  a minirity government is impossible because berlusconi 's party would exit the room ( no more legal number ) . 
  yes i was thinking of the balance of trade , i made a mistake . 
  thank you for your post , it is worthy to read . 
  still all are printing money !, 
  usa uk japan china all, 
  the strong opposition to change the policy comes from a few states , not the majority at all . 
  you just have to take a look at what each state said yesterday to understand what is going on . 
  germany : `` italy did n't rejected austerity , it 's the only way to go blabla mario monti should continue blabla '' . 
  france : italian , with their votes , rejected austerity measures ... we need to change the european policy blabla . 
  spain and uk something else . 
  do you understand that it 's impossible all states do this ? 
  its something called mathematics . 
  yes but there is a difference . 
  silvio berlusconi is a corrupt liar and many other bad things so it 's natural that outside of italy ( and in italy too ) he is disliked . 
  beppe grillo is not understood outside of italy because the media report him just like a `` comedian '' not looking at ** what ** he said and ** why ** he reached nearly 30 % in so little time . 
  you have no idea of what you are talking about . 
  i agree with you, 
  so beacause years ago someone agreed in this currency policy i ( and all the other young people ) have to say : ok everything is ok , kill me ? 
  sure , cause for ceratin member countires this is not workingthey should bring back their own currency ... do you know the list of these country is composed by spain , italy , france and other ? 
  do you really think this is so easy ? 
  you forgot to quote the whole question '' ** italy has always been in debt , a lot ** ; why should there be a correlation between the raise in bond rates that started a couple of years ago and it 's high debt ? 
  yes seriosuly . 
  italy ( like japan and united states ) have a massive debt for decades , still the raise in bond rates started a couple of years ago only in italy . 
  italy , unlike japan and united states , started an austerity program . 
  i think you do n't have an idea of the impact of this to the whole eurozone . 
  italy is the 2nd industrial ( after germany ) and 3rd economy ( after germany and france ) in the eurozone . 
  italy is not the little greece . 
  this is not about italy anyway . 
  if germany continue with his stubbornness to impose its monetary policies ( that are ok for germany , but not for others ) the anti-european sentiment will increase 'till a point where something huge will happen . 
  this is not what i say , it 's just what is happening already and i 'm a pro-euro , but that 's the truth . 
  it is now the main party . 
  and europe is not understanding anything about that like what angela merkes said yesterday `` italy did not rejected austerity '' ( plz someone tell her that his puppet took 8 % ) . 
  a party that reach 30 % from nothin in so little time should be a warn to the whole eurozone . 
  no its not at all . 
  he allied with 2 parties ( 5 % +1 % ) at the start of the electoral campaign . 
  he was the prime minister for more than one year , he had the money for the campaign [ david axelrod ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_axelrod ) is not cheap , he had the vatican support , etc. 
  the impressive thing is the 5 star moviment , a new party that reach 30 % in so little time . 
  i doubt there is a recent case in the whole g8 . 
  `` italy did n't reject austerity ! '', 
  monti at 8 % was a clear approval xd, 
  since euro is here all the north countries improve and all the south countries are going down , do you really think this is a coincidence ? 
  do n't you see that is the monetary policy the reason ? 
  germany protects german interests ? 
  sure , but there is a difference between this and say that austerity is the cure for all the countries . 
  so the idea is killing 2/10 of them because otherwise 8/10 of them would be dead ? 
  do you have any idea how are they living ? 
  or be afraid to throw themselves into the hands of a `` man in command '' . 
  will italy ever learn this ? 
  the obstinacy of germany is blind . 
  and what angela merkel said today is grave and false . 
  they are not understanding what is really happening here and the dangers that this can bring to the whole eurozone . 
  a new impetuous and violent party that reach nearly 30 % in so little time should be a warn to the whole europe . 
  we are an export nation . 
  that 's not comparable with berlusconi 's media power in italy . 
  it 's really hard to understand for another country , but you have to think at the television and press he owns like an endless subtle propaganda . 
  old people and housewives are in his hand . 
  we are not following troika proposal . 
  we are the only `` pigs '' that did n't receive any financial help . 
  your point may be true .
