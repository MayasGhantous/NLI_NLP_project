  i just want to remeber you that berlusconi increased vat by one point , not monti . 
  anyway i agree that what monti did was not enough at all , and not fair too . 
  exaclty . 
  this is caused by the power of mass media not by `` democracy '' . 
  italian are not stupid , we are just manipulated/subjugated/plagiarized ( esplecially old people ) . 
  no it 's not special at all . 
  berlusconi will not rule . 
  the problem is that no one will . 
  i agree . 
  this is gon na be huge . 
  but he was still at the top of the party . 
  unfortunatly they never resign in italy . 
  that 's the reason the same faces are always there and the 5 star moviment is at 30 % . 
  no way . 
  i 'm leaving too . 
  this is just ridicolous . 
  he is not gon na win . 
  we have 3 party near 30 % . 
  you can understand that there will be no majority at all, 
  in trentino we 're doing even better than you !, 
  quoto, 
  there is a lesson to learn from us . 
  never ever give media power to one man only . 
  it 's too powerful . 
  i 'm crying, 
  he is winning ... he is coming back ... i wan na die this is gon na be huge . 
  first party 5 star moviment . 
  first coalition berlusconi . 
  is it more crazy continue to vote the same faces which ruled the last 20 years or the comedian ? 
  well the italian parliament is composed of the chamber of deputies and the senate . 
  bersani will have the majority of the first alone 'cause of the electoral law , but he will need monti in the senate . 
  yes i think they will have the majority , but who know . . we have too many actors this time ( the numbers of 5 star moviment are umpredictable ) . 
  but he will need monti too . 
  the tax should have been progressive . 
  i do n't think people do n't want to hear bad news if they are true because his popularity was higher some months ago . 
  he just did a really bad campaign and he is now a politician . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.fanpage.it/berlusconi-pronto-a-restituire-l-imu-con-i-miei-soldi/ ) and [ here ] ( http://www.rainews24.rai.it/it/news.php?newsid=175148 ) and [ here ] ( http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2013/02/22/berlusconi-restituiro-soldi-imu-di-tasca-mia-con-mezzo-miliardo-vivro-benissimo/509755/ ) and [ here ] ( http://www.lapresse.it/politica/berlusconi-rilancia-imu-se-mancano-i-soldi-pago-io-1.289493 ) and in the end ... the video where he said that http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uzr0-wbfcw the most press is not controlled by gruppo espresso at all . 
  mondadori is the first by a large margin , the majority of the magazine are from mondadori . 
  and about television i do n't even comment . 
  lawyers did not benefit from anything ? 
  so why they vote for him ? 
  why is the most representative profession in pdl and in the parlament ? 
  why do we have more lawyers than any other country in eu ? 
  - he touched softly the benefits of political parties and strong powers , he just increased the tax on the poors or on the people who already pay . 
  - he got the support of the vatican implying no civil union , no same sex marriage , no no no no everything . 
  - he did a really bad campaign . 
  - he is perceived like merkel 's puppet , just 2 days ago he said `` i do n't think merkel would be happy if center left win '' . 
  are you serious ? 
  who the hell care about what merkel want ? 
  and this is just the last one , he is obsessed with merkel since the beginning of the campaign . 
  - he is arrogant and distant from ordinary people . 
  i would never ever vote for the one with the support of the vatican . 
  and i think italy is governed by right since too much time . 
  it 's a miracle if he reach 10 % . 
  but why ? 
  you are versus berlusconi and grillo !, 
  2 real comedian . 
  you cant beat them in this way . 
  he should have been a serious professor , cold but serious . 
  1 ) he bought balotelli ( a national superstar football player ) implying that if his dying football 's team can rebirth , italy can too . 
  add the crazy football fans . . 2 ) he sent a letter to every single family in the country with random bullshit and the promise to remove the `` tax on home '' ( 5 bilion ) and reimborse the tax paied last year with his money . 
  3 ) there are a few people that actually benefit from his policies ( lawyers , construction etc ) 4 ) the media empire . 
  he controls 80 % of the televisions and 60 % of the press . 
  he is everywhere , at least 3 times a day between tv and radio . 
  you ca n't understand the media power if you do n't see what it can do . 
  a subtle and everlasting propaganda change people 's minds . 
  and in the end , italians do n't mass vote him . 
  his party is at 20 % ( and with 25 % abstained this means just 15 % of the electorate ) . 
  the problem is the electorate law ( created by him of course ) . 
  with an electorate system where you have to choose between x or y he would have no chace , but with this one the opposition splits in many different parties : 35 % left ( bersani ) - 15 % center ( monti ) - 20 % 5 star moviment ( grillo ), 
  today he even promised to reimburse 4 bilion of tax with his money and sent a letter to every single family in italy . 
  just unbelivable, 
  monti did the worst campaign possible . 
  really a bad one . 
  he hired [ david_axelrod ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_axelrod ) without understand that italian and american campaign are two different world . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eixtgd8hs8o really ?? 
  you are a cold bloded technocrat !, 
  you dont have to do this things , it 's just pathetic . 
  and he did many other mistakes . 
  fiat is doing ok on the global market . 
  in south america they have the highest market share , in usa they have chrysler etc. 
  it is the europe market their problem ( mainly because car sales in italy have fallen a lot ) . 
  do your leaders promise 1000 $ ? 
  do they buy a national superstar football player ( balotelli ) to resurrect milan implying italy can resurrect too ? 
  do they own 90 % of the media and are always in front page while the opponents are never in ? 
  bersani won the primary election with 60 % versus matteo renzi ( 40 % ) . 
  oo what are you talking about ? 
  he is at 19 % . 
  thieves , housewives brainwashed by all the television/magazine he controls , old people , lawyers , people with low education or who thinks the only way to get information is by television , many catholics . 
  months ? 
  days . 
  yes it is , but we were talking about spain . 
  a state is not like a person . 
  and considering the history yes , a lot of countries in time of crysis increased their debt until the crysis was over . 
  and only after they started reducing the debt . 
  in fact nearly all countries did this outside the calvinist area . 
  ireland got growth 'cause when you or me buy an iphone for some crazy rules some of that money goes to ireland . 
  and anyway ireland * increased * their debt in the last years , considerably . 
  yes sure , not a single country in the world outside the eurozone did austerity but they are all crazy probably . 
  when you see spain 's unemployment going from 26 % to 25 % you realize that austerity is working !,
