  did your government change something in the last weeks ? 
   portugal with the euro can borrow a lot more money from the markets , than what it would with the previous currency ; basically the markets are borrowing money to portugal as they would to germany , because if things go wrong , germany will be there to save the day . 
  this would be the case with eurobond . 
  now you are paying a lot more than germany for borrowing money . 
  with the same currency . 
  first : germany until now is not paying our debt . 
  period . 
  you ( and italy ) helped greece/spain/portugal / ireland . 
  second : italy would be happy to enter in a closer political union ( polls suggested that in the past ) , but it does n't seem to me that a more integrate political union will lead to eurobonds . 
  third : every country gave away that kind of sovereign . 
  not just germany . 
  the ecb should be independent , what do you suggest ? 
  that the ecb buys only abs from north europe ? 
  and who do you think is paying it ? 
  you know that sometimes you have to sign something or there will be impacts ? 
  you can be isolated etc ? 
  i blame who wanted it , not who was pushed to sign it . 
  yeah sure , cause everything was choose that time . 
  the fiscal compact was not imposed by germany a few years ago . 
  we must be all crazy in the south to think that . 
  just last week in france the government collapsed 'cause d some ministers said the swme . 
  it 's just an irrational feeling . 
  it concerns me , but it concerns me more that your country is imposing us to reduce it based on ideology . 
  it 's germany . 
  it must be the first in europe in everything . 
  yeah 0 debt . 
  debt is a sin . 
  only big country in the world obsessed by debt . 
  monthly post tax, 
  yes 'cause you have a leaning tower , a venice that is sinking and a 2200 years old pompeii and so on . 
   germany and italy both received 10 % of all applications . 
  that 's a surprise . 
  why are they coming here ? 
  we are not . 
  every single day/week . 
  and for all the parties ( partially excluded the renzi 's democratic party ) in a negative way . 
  he is an arci-super-ultra-federalist . 
  it is known . 
  seems a solid and deep source . 
  she is pro russian because ... she just is !, 
  i think it 's something about italian symbols , pasta pizza gelato etc. 
  the article inside is not so bad about him . 
  not like that . 
  italy the only one that put another country in least arrogant . 
  how can it be possible that every other country see themselves as least arrogant lol ( france ... : / ) the best was greece anyway ... 
  yeah probably you are right , they are just coming from lybia but they are also from other countries . 
  good point . 
  90 % of the immigrants landing in italy ( the country with the highest number of illlegal immigrants in the last year ) are from lybia . 
  lybia is in the extreme north . 
  with this reasoning , not a single european state should join nato . 
  and what do you think can italy do after it is released ? 
  i really doubt italy can veto it . 
  not to mention the smaller states . 
  here any politician say that italy is trying to keep or increase the food standard but the usa are deaf on this . 
  and it 's not a surprise , american standards are shit . 
  france was the one that 20 years ago refused to create a common european army . 
  that libya intervention was a really bad idea . 
  it does n't change because ireland/luxembourg do n't care about ethic , they keep veto everything and continue to steal ( yes if the profit are done in sweden but the taxes goes in ireland it 's stealing ) . 
   england has greatly benefited from the austerity it endured what austerity ? 
  your deficit is higher than both france and italy . 
  i felt very safe in germany . 
  and i 'm sure they are great guys , they just seems scary , that 's all . 
  maybe it 's 'cause i 'm used to the italian ones . 
  so maybe that 's the reason about this stereotype . 
  tell that to your cecilia malmstr\u00f6m . 
  wash yourself ? 
  german cooks way better than english one !, 
  i felt intimidated every time they passed . 
  maybe they are good on their job , but they are scary . 
  and still all the costs are on us .

  support what side ? 
  it 's not that one side is the democracy and the other the tyranny . 
  it 's a giant mess that even the usa did n't know what to do . 
  2nd of june when the repubblica italiana was born . 
  like the french strategy by sarkozy ? 
  bomb them and then when you realize that after the dictator comes the civil war and you ca n't do anything 'cause the country is splitted in two , just get out and ignore them ? 
  wrong . 
  libya under a dictator was not in chaos and the dictator was helping italy ( well , we paid them ) controlling their shores . 
  now the dictator is dead , libya is in chaos , they are all escaping trying to reach italy . 
  diesel for example . 
  anyway d&g no longer exist . 
  it was closed 1/2 years ago 'cause it was damaging the luxury brand dolce & gabbana . 
  ferrero ( nutella kinder tictac ) is 100 % italian . 
  it ' a not even listed in the stock exchange . 
  if you are talking about shoes overall yes . 
  leather is not cheap . 
  a pair of plastic shoes from h & m ca n't be considered high quality . 
  no one comes in italy except high quality manufacturers of shoes/bags/forniture . 
  croatia probably . 
  no italy is not fantastic at all or we would not have thousands of young people who emigrate , i just do n't like the generalization that leads to enclose all in a generic `` south '' . 
  for example italy did really few reforms compared to spain , at the same time italy did not received money but lent a lot to the others but that does not matter , we are all the same in the eyes of a lot of people . 
   the entire south has to still reform i 'm pretty sure you have absolutely no clue about the reforms done in spain or in italy in the last years . 
  just repeat what your media tell you ( 'cause it 's what you wan na hear ) . 
  and probably you also do n't know to what countries nl lended money but just a generic `` south '' . 
  yes it is . 
  i doubt these reasons come before `` we have a low corporate tax rate '' . 
  so why cecilia malmstr\u00f6m is refusing to do anything about the exodus that is taking place in the south ? 
  it 's a serious question , i really do n't understand where is the difference . 
  why your pm say something and the one you send to brussel do the opposite ?
