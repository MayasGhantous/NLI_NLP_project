please ... 
  while in germany i used to pay everything with my card , apart from the beer at the bar . 
  it 's because you should n't drink juice while eating pizza, 
  i honestly do n't know , i saw the other posts and a posted too ... 
  ehm , you know that risotto is rice and not pasta ?!, 
  mainly reddit and blinkfeed , sometimes google news, 
  i 'm living in a dorm , but it 's quite hard to meet my floormates , we are 9 and i sometimes meet just 3 of them in the kitchen . 
  the dorm bar is maybe the only place where i knew some germans , and i can speak german more easily when i 'm drunk, 
  i 'm in erasmus in germany right now and i can confirm that it 's quite hard to make friends with native student . 
  since i arrived here i attended the `` erasmus events '' organized for international students , as a result i met a lot of people coming from all over the world , but few germans . 
  if the problem is drunk driving , should n't they act with more controls on the road ? 
  what is the relation between studying and being able to drive ? 
  it would mean that most of the professional drivers who left school to race ca n't have one ? 
  but only the title is not clear enough , can you make a translation ? 
  maybe this is the solution , bring back slavery edit : / s obviously, 
  ok , i think i would n't understand anything there so . 
  do you really speak like this ? 
  it 's a serious question , nothing offensive , just it sounds strange ... 
  i do n't trust maps that show france better than us, 
  berlusconi 's voters were not ignorant and uneducated at all, 
  italian ( native ) , fluent english , b1 german and i 'm learning polish ( slowly ) . 
  i do n't exactly know spanish but i can understand it and have an easy conversation , does it count ? 
  after buying a new pair of skis i 'm waiting for it also here, 
  energy engineering, 
  well done germany , create good jobs for me . 
  i 'll come after university , see you in 3 years, 
  dear swiss , i like you because thanks to your low fuel price , we have a regional discount card to pay it less here . 
  and i like you also because you give good salaries to a lot of people i know , even if you hate us for this . 
  a translation ? 
  should they just die there ? 
  did n't they consider a minimum age ? 
  nope , never . 
  ireland 94 ? 
  so those few percent do n't know their language ? 
  or is it because of all italians who moved to london `` to improve their english '', 
  articolo 31-spirale ovale https://youtu.be/lksuyylvoya, 
  how can a 70 year old woman take care and educate a child ? 
  it all depends on how close you live to your grandma and how many times you eat with her, 
  you can swim ... 
  no one ever cares about varese :(, 
  the new interrail , but cheaper . 
  what about explaining what i 'm looking at ? 
  what ? 
  i knew things are pretty expensive up there , but this is a lot, 
  i went last february , beautiful city but it was cold af, 
  olive oil rules !, 
  this is r/europe , we are not all polish you know ? 
  if you do n't find an article in english you can make a translation in the comments, 
  finally someone with a similar breakfast !, 
  my breakfast ( 14 hours ago ) was only a tea because i forgot yesterday to go buy milk , usually i have milk and coffee or cappuccino, 
  dear mexican friends , what did you have for breakfast ? 
  i had been told not to smile nor wear glasses , in order not to change how my face looks like , i always wondered why they can hide half of their face, 
  thousands of lives will be saved by letting thousands of people die ? 
  it sounds like the american idea of bringing peace with war . 
  and even if we wanted to do so , should we do it all by ourselves ? 
  should n't europe be an union ? 
  ok , let 's let them die in the mediterranean so, 
  so we have to keep them all just because they come here from the sea and nobody wants them ? 
  even after eu said they have to be distributed in europe ? 
  are you really so selfish ? 
  in case it passed , can eu do something against this law ? 
  not a good morning , it 's raining af here in northern italy , and i hate rain, 
  i 'm glad he was stupid enough not to buy a ticket, 
  i 'm on your side ( for the moment ), 
  clean ones, 
  and we mention you < 3, 
  geez , you are trying all the shitty mainstream beers . 
  if you like it that way from italy drink moretti or peroni . 
  if you want to try good beers then you can find some less known ones . 
  i really like poretti ( 5 , 6 or 7 luppoli are the best versions ) , it 's not well known even in italy but it comes from my city , or mastri birrai umbri, 
  red for me , thanks,

  translation : an italian train , a eurocity 158 , derailed before the lucerne station . 
  according to the police at least 7 were injured . 
  passengers on board are around 160 , the train hit a pylon and the station is without energy . 
  causes of the accident are not yet known . 
  same also in finland and iceland, 
  why is the croatian song in italian and english ? 
  was it hard to write ferrero ? 
  they do n't produce only nutella ... btw , for who does n't know maria franca fissolo is the widow of michele ferrero, 
  ehm , i know that time passes quickly , but what you refer to as a couple of years ago was 6 years ago, 
  it 's celebrated every 50 years , we use as national holiday the 2 june , [ the republic day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/festa_della_repubblica ), 
  it 's not nice to fall with a gun on your back, 
  etna is not dangerous and it erupts almost every year, 
  till some years ago it was a good place to buy fuel , good old times ... 
  i know the most beautiful polish girl , i even managed to make her fall in love with me, 
  i already heard something from fisz , i like him, 
  i agree , it 's really good, 
  what is the problem with horse meat ? 
  we also use it, 
  do n't believe anyone who tells you the best food is not in italy, 
  football, 
  so poland has been in war with poland, 
  quite in contrast with every other snow image seen here on r/europe ... 
  meanwhile in [ north italy ] ( http://live.altabadia.org/cam006/foto/passogardena_nord.jpg ), 
  i just heard they agreed to release all the passengers, 
  is there a difference ? 
  below the po is all terronia,
