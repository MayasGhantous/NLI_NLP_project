  salamella is not salame , and yes it 's a street food, 
  yes , he 's really a bad ass, 
  oh come on , we are not so boring in milan . 
  and btw , how could you forget [ salamella ] ( http://www.manusmenu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/3-panino-con-la-salamella-7-1-of-1.jpg ) ? 
  edit : you forgot also [ porchetta ] ( http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/porchetta-112l-21.jpg ), 
  it 's the same difference between mayonnaise and egg, 
  putting ketchup on pizza should be a crime , but i have a polish girlfriend and she would never do it ( or maybe she knows i could break up after she tells me ), 
  that italian price is a bit too high , i have 4 gb for 5 $ , with 3 30gb cost 15 $, 
  they finish before christmas usually, 
   breakfast in sicily  8.56 do n't you work on monday morning ? 
  i 'll go also to parnu and then kuressaare before tallinn, 
  please no , i 'll be there ... maybe i should bring a jacket, 
  i would expect poland more drinking tea, 
  sound like really obvious things to me ... 
  he asked worst roads , not worst drivers, 
  i see you took it quite personally ... btw if you want to look for the ugly italian car you should link [ this ] ( http://ruoteclassiche.quattroruote.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fiat-duna.jpg ) more than the multipla, 
  if only it was n't so ugly ... 
  i bet alcohol helped, 
  it 's always been expensive here and a lot of people go to switzerland ( i live around 15km from the border ) because it 's cheaper . 
  actually , there were so many people going there that the region decided to give us a card to get a discount on fuel , last time i refuelled i paid it 1.35 $ per litre, 
  i forgot at least , wow 5 is a lot . 
  we have a fruit at the end of every meal usually, 
  they work so much that they do n't have time to eat, 
  we have a really diverse diet full of vegetables and fruit ( we are taught to eat at least 2 fruits per day and vegetables every meal ) . 
  moreover the italian food we eat is much lighter than the versions you find abroad, 
  we do n't drink a bottle every day ... 
  and is n't their lifestyle completely different from the polish one ? 
  explain me the difference so , because what i see is only racism . 
  how will it change for poland to accept few thousands people fleeing from war ? 
  they also do n't want to stay in italy , why should we keep them so ? 
  til poland is ruled by skinheads . 
  i am not , polish people are, 
   just not mena migrants simply because ~ ~ how wildly different and incompatible their culture is with ours ~ ~ they are black ftfy, 
  [ there was a birth record 9 months after their team won against england at euro 2016 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/03/28/birth-record-iceland-hospital-nine-months-day-since-win-england/ ), 
  paris , venice and rome, 
  so after breakfast ? 
  italy  six italian journalists are still under round-the-clock police protection because of death threats , mostly from the mafia or fundamentalist groups . 
  ** the level of violence against reporters ( including verbal and physical intimidation and threats ) is alarming , especially as politicians such as beppe grillo of the five star movement do not hesitate to publicly out the journalists they dislike . 
  ** journalists also feel pressured by politicians , and increasingly opt to censor themselves . 
  under a new law , defaming politicians , judges , or civil servants is punishable by sentences of six to nine years in prison . 
  many journalists , especially in the capital and the south of the country , say they are still subjected to pressure from mafia groups and local criminal gangs . 
  it 's funny because grillo always used this ranking to attack politicians and journalists, 
  what happened exactly ? 
  we celebrate the end of a dictatorship , i think it 's a good reason to celebrate , is n't it ? 
  so complete bullshit, 
   six toes what ? 
  i 'm coming to estonia this summer , you 'd better not tell such things, 
  pretty accurate, 
  what are those papers ? 
  a good way for poland to keep using coal and doing something to pollute less would be the use of [ gasification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coal_gasification ) , that can reduce the amount of sulfur and ashes and they would n't have to buy natural gas from russia .

  france . 
  if all the population is moving out i will not risk living with french people ^ / s and i can still have good wine and cheese, 
  not properly mine since i live with my parents , but our house is 240m ^ 2 plus a 1000m ^ 2 garden, 
  primary school ( 6-10 yo ) : around 200/300 middle ( 11-13 ) : less than 200 high school ( 14-18 ) : around 1500 university : 42 587 ( yep , quite big ),

  is it so hard to buy a thinner condom ? 
  check on booking.com , trivago.it or similar sites . 
  i usually check directly on the company website flights : ryanair and easyjet trains : depends on the country buses : flixbus, 
  italy is realy diverse and everywhere you go you will find something different . 
  you can have an idea reading [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_cuisine#regional_variation ), 
  wine wine wine wine . 
  about food everything you can find in italy, 
  in the country really common , in my area not really apart from some old german and dutch, 
  in italy we have a law forbidding to have your face covered in public places , it 's an old law but it applies also to the niqab, 
  that 's a great quality , i would vote for her, 
  this exactly the same as in italy , the last piece is called the shame piece because noone wants to eat it, 
  how could you forget about salamella ? 
  when we make potato puree here after smashing the potatoes we add a little bit of milk in a pan and mix it to make it less dry . 
  try, 
  of course the oil has to be added after cooking the pasta , do n't think of frying it . 
  you have great beers, 
  your women are beautiful, 
  `` a few '', 
  only if balsamico di modena, 
  olive oil of course, 
  bread and nutella or my grandma 's cakes . 
  going to ski i used to bring a [ kinder cereali ] ( http://www.viniesapori.net/archivio/2013/10/28/images/kinder%20cereali.jpg ), 
   i guess it would go like this from ok/good rep to very bad rep.   1 italians < 3, 
  you must be a troll . 
  if not i am really sad for you, 
  do n't you use some milk for the potato puree ? 
  ehm , no, 
  you started well ... 
  you can eat spaghetti only with olive oil if you have nothing else to make a sauce , and it 's not even bad ( if you use good oil ), 
  easter in italian is called pasqua , while the day after is pasquetta ( little easter ) . 
  we do n't have a strict tradition to be all together like for christmas but we tend to have a lunch with our family . 
  the biggest tradition is for the monday barbecue , everyone grills and it usually rains,

  football , every kind of motorcycle race and like the other countries around alps skiing, 
  when i 'm in the car i hate everyone, 
  there is a search bar, 
  3 is cheap and has a good coverage , tim and vodafone are the best with coverage but cost much more . 
  to buy a sim card just go to a shop with a document and they will do everything, 
  if so i let someone pro-life answer, 
  because it 's the result of a violence and the mother will see the child as a memory of what happened,
