  food and wine, 
  yes , i was thinking about songs in different languages , i like the first, 
  never, 
  nord : skagen denmark south : djerba tunisia east : krak\u00f3w poland west : tanger morocco highest : around 3500 skiing in cervinia, 
  it 's not about terrorism , they know people go to amsterdam for drugs . 
  you used the best word , decent , i would n't say it 's a good pasta or good sauces , but just a decent one you can find everywhere abroad, 
  even now that he 's attacking you ? 
   most czechs hate it do n't worry , my parents keep calling you czechoslovakia . 
  or you do n't like also this name ? 
  switzerland ? 
  a part of turkey ? 
  i doubt ... 
  but the worst thing dutch can do is destroying 18th century fountains , this is way worse than yelling ... 
  i 've always used sasso-carta-forbici , but i see we are four here with four different versions, 
  i was listening to [ marshmello ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alzhf5uqnu4 ), 
  do n't use duolingo , just buy a grammar book , you wo n't need to know how to say that the horse likes milk ... about germany , you can find courses in english only attending a master degree , i think no university has any program in english during the bachelor ( same also as in italy ), 
  they are hunting now , you will not have answers till they finish eating, 
  i would like to be able to easily see for free all the european free channels, 
  same here in italy, 
  considering the weather could be polenta or pizzoccheri, 
  you are on askeurope , not europeask, 
  why so much hate ? 
  what 's wrong with travelling ? 
  if you want to travel to some other countries or cities give a look to ryanair or easyjet for a flight and megabus or flixbus for a bus , the period is not the cheapest to travel but you could find something, 
  in prague it was even cheaper, 
  some italian artists i like : caparezza zen circus articolo 31 subsonica talco willie peyote mannarino fast animals and slow kids, 
  jesus no , not him ... 
  in milan they sell selfie stick, 
  rose sellers at the traffic lights , i never saw any in other countries, 
  italian , spanish , polish , french spoken by girls and german, 
  amazon, 
  since you are interested in rural locations i would suggest visiting a `` sagra '' , small events dedicated to some particular food , if you tell me when you plan to go i look for something, 
  is n't switzerland all expensive ? 
  i did n't experience any racism , but maybe only because i was in a small city with mostly students living . 
  would stop fighting the crime for lunch , no matter if there 's a superbad trying to destroy the world , lunch is more important edit : [ relevant ] ( https://youtu.be/pdfgd_qyhdo ), 
  i personally would go to germany , because i 've already lived there for 7 months and know a bit of german . 
  why do you want to move ? 
  what languages do you already know ? 
  i watched adam 's apple , i would recommend this, 
  what european cars ca n't you import ? 
  every region has a different dialect , and in some places it 's still used a lot . 
  it 's hard to understand every dialect you are not used to . 
  about accent , for me in the north its hard to understand the southern ones , since are completely different ( i needed subs watching the tv series gomorra ), 
  she 's polish , we met in erasmus and now living far , it 's not easy and i do n't have a lot of free time to visit her since i 'm both a student and i work , we are thinking i could move there for my master . 
  i imagined polish guys have to look abroad to find a free girl , with all those foreigners coming and finding girls in poland ( i 'm sorry , i 'm one of those ), 
  the list would be too long ... 
  i wish more people used it here , but we all use only whatsapp, 
  generally yes , wine is preferred and we have much more good wines than good beers , but we definitely have some good ones too . 
  ( and imo it 's still way better a moretti than the beers with rasperry juice you drink  ), 
  this is actually the most difficult thing to learn , you ca n't move then randomly or we 'll get confused and wo n't understand you, 
  we say that to speak spanish you just need to add an s at the end of every word , i guess you can easily speak italian by removing all those ending s, 
  or come to us , here in italy, 
  here we think the best erasmus is in spain , almost no need to speak a different language , a lot of fun and easy exams . 
  but i think i 'm a bit masochist , because i went to germany . 
  avantieri ? 
  [ ehm ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carpaccio ), 
  inaccurate : we are all part of mafia accurate : any other, 
  i 've never been anywhere in asia , but i guess japanese is really far from what we know here , also because most japanese restaurants ( usually they are all you can eat for less than 20 $ ) are run by chinese people, 
   we honestly ca n't do much about it though . 
  why ? 
  theoretically we are a laic country , practically we are not . 
  many laws based on ethics ( gay marriage , abortion , euthanasia ... ) are opposed by many people . 
  and generally speaking catholic religion is considered part of our culture . 
  but young people are not really religious , apart from some ( i see many of you do n't know any , i know maybe a dozen very religious ), 
  native : italian fluent : english not so fluent : german can understand and try to be understood : spanish, 
  sorry for the stupid question , is there a lot of difference between irish and english ? 
  i 'll keep it in mind if i come visit sweden, 
   how should i dress ? 
  in winter wear a duvet jacket like [ those ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=piumino&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1436&amp;bih=782&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjs8rithppnahvlfrokhz5hc2eq_auibigb ) , in summer shorts and a shirt or a white tshirt  what should i do in everyday life ? 
  things to know if you do n't want to make italians angry : * italian ice-cream is the best * real pizza is only in italy , and absolutely no pineapple * ok , in general italian food is the best * coffee is espresso , long coffee is not used , and cappuccino never after noon, 
  when i ask my polish gf `` how are you ? '', 
  she never answers fine , the best i can get is `` ok , why do you ask ? '', 
  we love [ fica ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fica ) too !!, 
  btw , what 's your problem with strangers ? 
  as an italian i ca n't imagine people like that ... 
  our cities are `` quite '' old , with narrow streets and lots of traffic . 
  a scooter is easy to drive in those conditions and are usually cheaper than a real motorcycle . 
  moreover you can drive a 50cc since 14yo and with car driving license you can drive a 125 . 
  teaching creationism in school, 
   why does n't anyone use air conditioning ? 
  during summer here the temperature is often around 30 \u00b0 c but we never use ac , i think we just got used . 
  while driving i turn it on only if i 'm on a highway , because open windows would be too annoying with high speed . 
   you people eat like birds ... healthy , skinny birds . 
  thanks , i take it as a compliment . 
  we care a lot about what we eat , i admit i eat a lot , but i 've been used since a child to eat vegetables and fruit at least twice a day . 
  and people here in italy are often quite narcissist ... 
   i 'm sorry for sounding rude you are not being rude , he is . 
  same for me if we beat you, 
  istanbul is the most `` westernized '' ( does this word exist ? ), 
  city in turkey , probably they wanted to give a signal to those people abandoning the strict islamic life . 
  wow , what a self esteem !, 
  food , wine , sea and art . 
  am i the only one who does n't like dutch cheese ? 
  everyone likes it , but in my opinion it 's nothing compared to what you can find in france or italy ... 
  usually [ salamella ] ( http://www.manusmenu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/3-panino-con-la-salamella-7-1-of-1.jpg ) or [ piadina ] ( http://blog.giallozafferano.it/cucinaplus/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/piadina-recheada.jpg ), 
  can confirm about giallozafferano , it 's a good site , and the app has also some recipes in english . 
  the only thing i do n't like in that site are cakes and desserts, 
  i just read the carbonara recipe , maybe one of the most raped italian dishes , and obviously it is as i expected . 
  garlic ? 
  cream ?
