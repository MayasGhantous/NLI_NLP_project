  * `` officer , i ca n't be drunk i swear , i only took a little sip from mom 's tits '' *, 
  by selling stuff on ebay , a multinational corporation , oh the irony, 
  toddlers are little drunk people , those policemen are doing the right thing !, 
  yeah , let 's segregate !, 
  ( spending money to improve internal security is out of question ofc , uh ? ), 
  what if i 'm short ? 
  * `` pull my finger !, 
  her hat looks like a cake , no complaining tho, 
  now i want a steak, 
   they do n't want to leave because of all the ~ ~ autonomy ~ ~ money they get . 
  st. peter basilica almost 140m tall , never realized it was that tall . 
  impressive , especially thinking it was built almost 500 years ago . 
  in italian it 's ferrovia , literally iron road, 
  are you telling me the eiffel tower in vegas is not genuine ? 
  mindblown, 
  `` ombrello '' and `` parasole '' in italian, 
  the celebration is over, 
  italy can still be warm ( rome in october and november is warm enough to just wear a shirt during the day ) and not crowded with lots tourists .

  i 've seen hanging cables only in really remote rural places indeed , no power transformers tho , but perhaps that has something to do with the higher voltage used in europe ( 240v ), 
  cold , grizzly , gold , oil , bush flying , salmons, 
  i ca n't understand why in the usa you still have electrical transformers and power wires hanging from poles . 
  oh , and why do i have to look at a floating turd before flushing ? 
  some d'essai movie theaters offer movies in original language with subtitles , but you got ta look for em . 
  vast majority is dubbed as quirite stated . 
  molla er fiasco,

  38c today in rome , gladly humidity went down a bit . 
  i would say this is a kinda `` normal '' heatwave , not a chill summer but i ca n't say i never experienced this heat before . 
  this is more like it . 
  he said one hit , jalisse were crap from the start . 
  the big thing in italy is sanremo song festival , but is more of a mundane event than anything , song quality is usually pretty low/on the commercial side , and winners usually get forgotten pretty soon . 
  same here , people even barely know it exist, 
  belsedere - nice butt bastardo - bastard purgatorio - purgatori femminamorta - dead female strangolagalli - strangle cocks,

  boh it 's the most italian word ever whenever someone ask you something and you have no idea , you just answer `` boh ? '', 
  my dad has 2 hunting rifles , but have n't used em in 40 years . 
  i was sarcastic ofc , being a well behaved citizen should be implicit, 
  learn the language and how to properly boil pasta, 
  yeah well , most religion based festivities are related to season changes anyway, 
  romans used to celebrate mitra on december 25th , and mitra sports several other similarities with jesus cult . 
  is not a matter of nudity tho , is more like we do n't really dig sweaty armpits of shirtless people . 
  no , gladly, 
  mac and cheese in the usa is not the equivalent of our pasta burro e parmigiano , is more like pasta drowned in a sea of molten cheese . 
  lol, 
  there are also rome , turin , naples , basically any major italian city, 
  they will just build taller dams, 
  none of the above , we had migrants trying to reach our coasts well before 2015, 
  cin-cin prosit alla salute,

  greece , spain , croatia, 
  no need to convince you , just look for yourself, 
  are we ? 
  this is on the same league as : * `` if the battle of the teutoburg forest never happened y' all be speaking some romance language '' *, 
  because very little people speaks italian outside of italy, 
  * `` mr gorbachev tear down this wall '' *, 
  yep , it was the same here , vape stores at every corner . 
  now you got ta look for one . 
  unbearably hot in april ? 
  afaik it was our usual april this year , no wonder tourists suffer so much in summer . 
  i always see doses expressed in mg, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gzew4u44kq it 's the exact same video , they just dubbed it, 
  some of our most iconic tv comercials [ pennello cinghiale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmirzdtydiw ) [ cedrata tassoni ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l4dzia8n0k ) [ pasta barilla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3sdmhnsj4 ) this one got famous because was directed by federico fellini [ brandy vecchia romagna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wddy2bq-csk ) as a kid it made me discover beethoven music, 
  lol , here too . 
  * '' ... e poi c ` era la marmotta che confezionava la cioccolata '' * in a sarcastic tone has become a synonymous of `` yeah right , suuuuuure ... '' same tv comercial btw, 
  * `` houston , we have a problem '' *,

  deja vu anyone ? 
  `` nella merda fino al collo '' we say exactly the same in italy i see crap is a recurrent theme in all languages xd, 
  ah got it , somehow like a fried doughnut , it would be breakfast food in italy then .

  in rome there are a couple of bunkers , one in villa ada and was mostly used by the former royal family during wwii , and then there is mussolini 's bunker in villa torlonia . 
  both have been restored and repurposed as museums . 
  i think it could be said both ways, 
  geothermic source ? 
  centralized methane gas, 
  volleyball and basket i believe, 
  my selfmade amatriciana, 
  you can get a fine if the license plate is unreadable for any reason , but you got ta find some zealous cop, 
  well , is pretty easy to get a fine , especially regarding parking violations , speeding on the highway is a big no-no since they installed tutor and other speed trap systems . 
  the problem is managing the huge amount of traffic in our big cities , police ca n't be everywhere all the time . 
  it also really depends on the power consumption of your appliances , depending on the device a 220v -  110v transformer could cost more than the appliance itself, 
  i believe they were disliked at the apex of their migration phenomenon in the 90s/early 2000 .
