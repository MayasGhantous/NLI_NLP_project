  italy is insignicant in europe . 
  edit : [ i ca n't see renzi ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cjvoqp9wcaa0uwg.jpg:large ), 
  my mayor is totally idiot . 
  it 's time for anschluss # 2 !, 
  a meet up in venice would be amazing !, 
  [ heitalia mater race ] ( http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/13600000/hetare-hetalia-13675090-2560-1739.jpg ) little hint : that 's the new eu flag, 
  italy is so much backward in that sense , italians are subject to the papal state . 
  i am ashamed to be italian right now . 
  pizza . 
  * pizza * . 
  time for itaexit !, 
  italy can into pacifism !, 
  italy can into economic growth !, 
  yeeeee, 
  skype and mojang are now part of microsoft corp. , so they ca n't be considered as startup anymore . 
  what the hell are you saying ? 
  we never supported russia 's actions in ukraine even if the sanctions cost us more than 2 billion $ ( and our economy is not that healthy ) . 
  the only parties that support russia are lega nord and fratelli d'italia but they are not part of the government . 
  they are part of eu 's system so they can . 
  here are the sources : [ 1 ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/immigrazione/2012/02/23/news/l_italia_condannata_per_i_respingimenti-30366965/ ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2012/02/23/immigrazione-italia-condannata-corte-europea-respingimenti-libia/193241/ ) ( italian only , i 'm sorry :( ) . 
  probably it is the `` b plan '' of our pm , matteo renzi . 
  but in the past ( 2009 ) we got sued ( 15k $ per person ) because we sent immigrants back to their countries ( that were considered by the european court of human rights dangerous ) . 
  no we ca n't send them back . 
  in 2009 the european court of human rights sued us because we sent immigrants back to their country . 
  we get sued by 15,000 $ per person . 
  apparently any member of eu ca n't send immigrants back if their country are considered lifethreating . 
  what does europe want from italy ? 
  we ca n't handle that stream : ( they 're too many and they do n't want to be registered by the police ) but also we ca n't ( obviously ) sink the boats and we ca n't send them back to their countries . 
  it 's really a difficoult situation for us . 
  yurop can into relevance !, 
  edit , 
  that 's enough ~ ~ wine ~ ~ ** vodka ** for today , putin , please go to sleep . 
  if we that do the rest of europe ( including you ) will call us nazi . 
  it 's simple . 
  come on !, 
  cold  hot weather all the way !, 
  yes , during these days the heat was just unbearable . 
  damn guys you need some teasers . 
  pragmatism and cold weather from germany . 
  god dammit 35 \u00b0 c in venice ? 
  wtf ? 
  i did n't expect that level of anti-semitism ( maybe is because the strong impact of catholic culture ) . 
   italy is often described , particularly in the international community , by negative parameters : public debt , scarce competitiveness , and a nominal budget deficit ( which , in the past , led to the european commission 's opening of an excessive deficit procedure ) . 
  however , alongside these data , there are some economic indicators that are more suitable for representing italy as what it is : one of the main countries of the developed world , the second-ranking european country for manufacturing , and the third largest economy in the euro area . 
  italy is country that has been , in the last 20 years , capable of keeping its accounts under control and of ranking as one the best performing countries in europe and in the world . 
  this presentation provides some economic data about italy that are not known or not well enough known , and that are designed to eliminate bias and to adequately represent a country that has actively contributed to the creation of the european union . 
  japan , pure awesomeness !, 
  yes , i 'm not scared of a military invasion . 
  but putin is stupid and mad as fuck , he can blow up the status quo of the world by nuking random countries or shut off the gas industry in eu . 
  i 'm totally fine with it !, 
  i think is due the choice of their flag colors ( green , white and red ), 
  italy has plenty of them : [ ortisei ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/36017700@n02/15298686427/ ) , trentino aldo adige [ savogno ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/signalkuppe/5139598365/ ) , lombardia [ petroio ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/22217581@n05/5751154931/ ) , toscana [ gangi ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/24823485@n06/12644363474/ ) , sicilia [ pisticci ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/87513876@n03/8689625452/ ) , basilicata [ sant ` agata de ' goti ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/dianasch/14787237209/ ) , campania [ colledimezzo ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/blueblond/4043118115/ ) , abruzzo [ alleghe ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/carmelo61/2803406666/ ) , veneto [ zoagli ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/enricobave/14793388442/ ) , liguria [ crampiolo ] ( http://www.ciaspole.net/ciaspole-crampiolo1.jpg ) , piemonte [ monte santo di lussari ] ( http://img1.juzaphoto.com/shared_files/uploads/1157728.jpg ) , friuli venezia giulia [ fermignano ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/bercellino/11114032985/ ) , marche italy is truly beautiful , it could be an endless list . 
  poland stronk !, 
  the same thing in italy ( us bases in aviano and ghedi ) , we have about 70 bombs under our ass . 
  savage, 
  we are [ blue ] ( https://youtu.be/za52unzx7y4 ) . 
  they are sealocked and not relevant ( i 'm jocking guys , i love you < 3 ), 
  slovenia can not into turkish geography knowledge :(, 
  gg east berlin . 
  renzi can not handle all that power . 
   it 's eu 's fault, 
  as always norway is masterrace . 
  we decrease from 60 million to 60 million . 
  :( even our decreases are incredibly weak . 
  better hide the real numbers , italians are very homophobic , especially if you go to southern italy . 
  yeah but we are italy 's least favorite country :'(, 
  yes , we are weak . 
  in italy uber pop is illegal , taxi drivers are acting like mafia . 
  no , we change side . 
  yes please , i need it, 
  swedistan stronk, 
   best cakes really ? 
   everyone knows polders are superior because of the food bonus . 
  they add color to the map too . 
  and create one of the greatest turist trap ever . 
  apart from mexico ( obviously they hate him ) , italy is ranked second because italian media describes trump as usa 's berlusconi , so that 's why mrs clinton is preferred . 
  in north-eastern italy i think it 's german , in north-west french , in the south spanish . 
  another reason to go to croatians beaches , much much better . 
  [ no ] ( http://i1.tribune.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/864839-putinafp_-1428219082-978-640x480.jpg ) . 
  even smaller than japanese houses , wow . 
  what a waste of money this referendum was . 
  til china is a regional power . 
  c'mon air strip one we are no longer in the xviii century . 
  new roman republic . 
  ^ ^ zoon ^ ^ empire, 
  goin ' war with germany did n't work well for us . 
   prop-up a government in libya , we 're trying , almost impossible . 
   pay a government to take refugees back , pay a government in libya to set a italian/european run ` refugee ' camp and deport people to here to keep them nogovernmentfound.jpg . 
  `` italian/european '' , europe does n't give a shit about italian immigration problem , now germany is sheltered from any flux thanks to austria , hungary and fyrom . 
   deport them to countries of origin instead of libya extremely expensive , a lot of them come from `` war zones '' so it 's also illegal to deport them , their home country does n't want them . 
   there 's just no will or competence , only ineptitude in italy . 
  i do n't feel much for sharing in the consequences of that . 
  no comment . 
  other solutions ? 
  shot boats ? 
  our constitution does n't allow it , we need a special request from a lybian government but , y know , since gheddafi there are none . 
  build a giant spaghetti wall and make italy great again ? 
  [ oh , really ] ( http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120223/local/italy-violated-human-rights-when-it-pushed-migrants-back-to-libya-echr.408194 ) ? 
  ca n't wait to get more human rights violations . 
  you forgot r/itaglia .
