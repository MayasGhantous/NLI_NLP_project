  the real original subreddit for the italico vomo, 
  russian minority spotted in italy, 
  we shouted about the `` refugees '' crisis about 4 years ago and no one helped us . 
  then the baltic route open the flow almost directly to germany , the eu in just few month have secured its borders and stipulated a treatment with turkey . 
  now the mediterranean route is ready to be invaded again . 
  german problem are eu 's problem , italian ones not so much . 
  europe abandoned us years and years ago , now our entire peninsula is going to be a gigantic `` refugee '' camp . 
  at least some time ago we had an agreement with gheddafi but now thanks to france and uk he 's dead and now lybia is a war zone . 
  they wo n't do anything . 
  i 'm sure about this . 
  now we are waving our hands around swearing god , the next phase is written comments . 
  ca n't wait to see english people destroy themself with their hand . 
  and of course they 'll blame eu one , last time . 
  glorious germoney . 
  well france can you please stop stealing other country 's works of art and return them to their home countries ? 
  of course italy wins here , but i do n't think it is a good thing : / muh castaah, 
  banks are not the only italy 's problem . 
  we have a lot of corruption , organized crime eradicated in the institutions . 
  economically the country is split in half , the odds between south and north is gigantic . 
  also populist parties are sky rocketing such as movimento5stelle and lega nord , both of the are extremely eurosceptic . 
  our gdp decreased by 10 % with the economic crisis and seems to be irrecoverable . 
  and sadly austerity measures are n't helping much containing public debt grow . 
  i 'm not saying that we are doomed , but sure we are drowning in a shitty sea . 
  i see a russian minority in france , it has to be protected !, 
  potato power . 
  i actually think that erdogan should learn more about european laws . 
  does eu really want this guy ? 
  oh not this again . 
  in northern italy we do n't have sunny days , only fog . 
  we beat you again ~ ~ france ~ ~ ** frogs ** honhonhonhonhon ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s btw i want to see a regional one ( with 2016 data ) , is there any ? 
  i 'm curious about how much difference there is between southern ( especially calabria , campania and sicily regions ) and northern italy . 
  you forgot * ' o core * o ( \u2267 \u2207 \u2266 o ) ( o \u2267 \u2207 \u2266 ) o,

  bestonia stikes again !, 
  i think poland has the best space agency in the world . 
  god save the tsar . 
  eurobros there is a lot more than rome , venice , florence & milan : if you want the countryside go to tuscany , if you want beaches there are sardinia , lampedusa , apulia ( do n't stop in rimini !, 
  ) , if you want history there are trieste , verona , vicenza , turin , genoa ecc . 
  i 've always wanted to visit ** ukraine ** . 
  a lot of history in crimea . 
  ah ~ ~ dubrovnik ~ ~ ** ragusa ** is beautiful . 
  sorry estonia but we are more qualified than you in the nordic league .

  if you stay in switzerland about 1 month then every fucking country ( monaco and singapore excluded ) in the world seems cheap . 
  damn you renzi !, 
  i 'm sad because you 're sad .

  of course . 
  only if you are a journalist .

  glorious padania . 
  if i will be available it would be a pleasure  , but in this period i 'm bouncing between trieste , venice and milan . 
  oh fuck , in the upcoming week i 'll buy several cartons of marlboro . 
  thank you for the hint . 
  i smoke marlboro gold , the slovenian price is ** 3.90 $ ** while the italian one is ** 5.20 $ ** . 
  it 's a big difference even though i smoke a small amount of cigarettes !, 
   so turks , italians , americans , a far right wing subreddit and ~ ~ ice cream ~ ~ ** gelato ** . 
  obviously , if you close your borders with trieste how could i buy cigarettes and diesel with low taxation ? 
  italy start to clean up your navy , the mediterranean route is back again in all its magnificence . 
  how can we build a wall on the sea ? 
  maybe a spaghetti wall . 
  renzi always fails .

  i 've also been to both of them and i found berlin cheaper , cleaner , less crowded and more organized . 
  btw i prefer 20th century history over the roman period . 
  and now that the balkan route is closed they 'll start to seal the mediterranean sea again , our navy is ready to be used as taxi again . 
  you 're wrong m8 . 
  prague or berlin are the best choices . 
  if money are a problem go to prague , if not ... both of them !, 
  nope , berlin  rome, 
  i change-a side-a .
