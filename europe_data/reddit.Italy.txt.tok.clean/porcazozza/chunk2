  just like stereotypes, 
  first of all , being an entrepreneur and the boss/ceo/president of a large company are two * completely different things . 
  second , there 's [ proof ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyclay/2013/01/05/the-top-10-jobs-that-attract-psychopaths/ ) that people in charge of big ass companies usually lack empathy and such edit : man , such effort to destroy an argument , and everything vanishes when the guy deletes the comment, 
  is the world turning into a comic book , where all the supervillains pat each other 's back ? 
  well , being the president of a company and being a politician both require you to not have a soul,

  it can only be better than * speed 2 *, 
  i still do n't understand why they did n't include paris,
