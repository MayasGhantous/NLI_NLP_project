  i do n't know , man . 
  bremen 's local election seems quite important for the economy of a south east asian country with 100 million people, 
  only billionaires can afford to go to zimbabwe, 
  so filling this sub with posts about uk is okay , but talking a little bit about poland is just too much ? 
  cut our polish friends some slack , they are people too . 
  you 're still not representing 12 % of the voters, 
  great !, 
  now let 's go drink !, 
  i 'm absolutely not an expert , but i 'll just guess why that 's possible . 
  being poor in the usa does n't mean you 're not able to feed you and your family - in fact , the welfare system is efficient enough to help people in need - but it 's usually associated with poor education , which brings people to ignore certain aspects of their body and their diet . 
  plus , since the 80s , the us have had less laws regulating the amount of sugar in a wide range of food , especially meat , which is fundamental in the southern diet . 
  yeah , i mean , in this context it means * language * , but , yeah , you 're right, 
  i do n't know, 
  a few words have the same meaning and sound alike in some italian dialects , like `` limba '' , which means `` language '' both in romanian and sardinian, 
  understood at least 90 % of what 's written there . 
  romance languages stronk, 
  it was n't even meant to be a strike, 
  needs more vocals, 
  meh , i do n't know , i do n't think the bulls have enough money to bribe them all, 
  humans of perm, 
  hey , at least they 're not basques, 
  basques are people too . 
  i bet it 's baro\u0161, 
  it 's simple : you tell people you respect the constitution to let them feel they 're somewhat represented and that 's the will of the nation , then you say that you 're the person the country needs and proceed to deny any possibility that any kind of opposition will rule and make people afraid that if anyone except you became president , everything will collapse , then create a pantomime classically referred to as `` election '' and win with a 97.7 % , which will make you look like a total badass to the eyes of the pleb . 
  say that ron paul is shit and proclaim a proletariat dictatorship, 
  that 's what i call living the life, 
  nope, 
  * ave , caesar , morituri te salutant * yeah , that 's all the high school latin i remember, 
  finland 's michael cera,

  a turk on the dramatrain about the armenian genocide . 
  who would have thought ? 
  these people should fire their graphic designers, 
  we need to fucking stop these users coming from nowhere who try to troll our ~ ~ country ~ ~ sub, 
  but i do n't see why we should seek their help when the entire european community can do this , porcazozza !, 
  no , i 'm just saying that i do n't see why they would care about finding a solution in the mediterranean immigration crisis . 
  they just do n't have an interest in it . 
   we give lampedusa to the usa that 's it , guys . 
  the us are the solution to the entire world 's problems . 
  that 's what we get for being a top 100 sub, 
   getting hard, 
  you consider yourself zeus ? 
  for a moment i thought i was playing football manager, 
  i do n't know how that kind of stuff works, 
  she was catholic, 
  such a cool guy !, 
  he also treats women so well !, 
  yeah , it sucks , but his career is over , so i guess that 's fine, 
  well , actually , i think that it kinda sounded bad . 
  in defense of this sub , you have to understand that people are not able to know * what your true feelings are, 
  then i guess people did n't understand it was sarcasm, 
  i hope you dropped the / s, 
   i miss berlusconi [ mfw ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/ernest_joseph_bailly_-_in_contempt_of_hate.jpg ),

  the danker of the candidates to the circlejercaty throne wins the heart of m ` lady, 
  and whoever mentions climate change dies, 
  steal some chords from marvin gaye and make it without lyrics .

  agreed , national anthems only exist to make you look badass before a football match . 
  * looks at op 's flair * ah , i 've just lost a bet with myself, 
  today rome was hot as hell , so i would recommend you to only come during winter, 
  at least someone cares about libertarians, 
  we usually blame ourselves,

  even the pope believes in evolution tho, 
  i bet she 's having a great time being a politician now,
