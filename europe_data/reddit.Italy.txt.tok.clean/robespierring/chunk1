well , thank you . 
   the next world cup you win i guess that you 'll have to forgive somebody else for the next, 
   that should have been enough to understand the pattern as said below , the common pattern is the `` question mark '' . 
  crazy , but true . 
  guys , guys , guys . 
  i know that this will blow your mind , but that is ... a ** question mark ** . 
  i know , it seems crazy , but everytime it 's used there is a question mark , and every time there is a question mark you can use it . 
  leave him alone . 
  he just want your attention . 
  he does n't need to be in parlamient to be the leader of his party . 
   the lemmings game btw : http://www.elizium.nu/scripts/lemmings/, 
  i was here to post the same : `` made in eu '' = `` made in east europe , because we are europe , deal with it ''  but also [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1dk1jk/first_made_in_europe_label_ive_seen_are_there_more/c9r2vj2 ), 
  [ you have a good point ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/composition-division ), 
  very hard to foreseen, 
  as usual the most important point is always missing : ** the point of view of the supporters of berlusconi ** . 
  i never see an online discussion with a proper and unbiased description of `` the other side '' , so [ i tried to fix this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/192pak/can_someone_explain_why_italians_are_still_voting/c8kqgny ) in / r/italy . 
  i 'll x-post the comment here : -- the following are not my points of view but [ ... ] this is how a supporter of berlusconi would answer your question . 
  i do n't like the `` italy votes berlusconi because brainless zombies '' version of the story , it 's biased and kind of unfair . 
  i think you do n't have the big picture untill you do n't understand also this unpopular point of view . 
  1 ) problem with justice ? 
  he is just a victim of persecution of the left wing judges . 
  look how much ex-judges there are in the left wing of the parlament . 
  he had a lot of proceeding , but he never found guilty for anything . 
  this is just a political issue and we should stop to waste public money for this . 
  2 ) the media ? 
  he may own some tv channels , but nonetheless most of the media are againist berlusconi . 
  de benedetti ( he is old bitter enemy ) owns a bigger media empire , most of the newspaper are againist him , the main media events of the year ( es . 
  : festival of sanremo ) typically are againist him , there are comedians ( es . 
  : benigni , crozza , etc. . ) and journalists ( santoro , travaglio , etc. . . ) who made a fortune just because they are againist him ( and they are also very famous just because of this ) , even in the show schedule of his 3 tv channel you can find very different journalists and opinin leaders with a wide variety of point of view : you ca n't say they are all supporter of berlusoconi ( actually few of them are ) . 
  did n't you remember how berlusconi was badly pictured by all the media just 6-7 months ago ? 
  stop sayng that berlusconi is voted because he can influence the media !, 
  3 ) the italian politic was even worse before berlusconi : governments were much more instable and also after the election you could n't know which prime minister would have been elected . 
  with berlusconi this changed and he made the italian democracy a little more modern . 
  he was one the best enterpreuner we have ever had and he is one the few modern politician in italy , all the other would bring back the old politic . 
  4 ) taxes . 
  berlusconi want to keep taxes at minimun , he had some difficulties to do this in the past , but also he had several success and he is the only one who is talking about this issue . 
  monti and the left wings know how to lead italy just by raising taxes . 
  5 ) promises . 
  he respect them . 
  as somebody who had berlusconi as pm for a decade , i do n't see how you can enjoy this . 
  it 's not funny to be so unprofessional if you have such an important role . 
   not some type of eu tourism board exactly . 
  and probably there would n't be enough budget for such a video . 
   one family , 2 cameras , 30 countries , ** 60 flights ** , 1000 + time lapse videos , 200,000 + images - almost 20 terabytes of data !, 
  hello everyone , i 'm from taiwan . 
  this is a compilation of time lapse videos shot over the last ** two years ** when i travelled europe with my wife and son, 
   there 's nothing of present worth mentioning which should be worrying of course there is . 
  and it 's mentioned in any other thread where it would n't be off-topic . 
  it 's few months old , but gold : article : http://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-users-laugh-off-isis-threat-to-invade-rome/, 
   best to leave behind our nationalism and consider the number of unesco sites in the entire eu agree . 
  wait a second ... following that logic ... 
  i should be proud because in europe we have the best beer and '' * friet * '' of the world ? 
  i did n't open your link , but i do n't think that 's the issue . 
  that 's the same requirements we have in italy and street view is correctly compliant . 
  the color scheme seem confusing untill you realize there was not traffic light in 1914, 
  the trial happened , but they were not `` on trial because they failed to predict an earthquake '' , that 's common misconceptions you always read in reddit . 
  just carefully read the sources you provided . 
  do n't forget that almost any small town is half hour away from a bigger city , and at most 3 hours away from one of the main capitals, 
  guys ... can you believe the karma you could get if we talk them about the erasmus project ? 
  they have no idea, 
  what ? 
  italy has money to pay the debt , but an higher growth would make everything easier . 
  the italian debt is something like 2.000.000.000.000 $ ( not exagerating ) , and without growth italy ca n't make significant investment , becasue it can only slowly pay the interests, 
  classic r/italy meme are best meme, 
  italian fascism is probably the most prototipical kind of fascism . 
  here a list of excellent definitions : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/definitions_of_fascism and something more specific about the italian version of it : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fascism_and_ideology  can you describe it in your own words ? 
  it 's what we look for when we are scared , threatened , confused , hungry and uncertain . 
  it 's subtle because you think it ca n't happen to you and you do n't recognize it because it proceeds slowly and gradually . 
  it gives you safety , unity and strength , they say it will change everything and save your country , but it 's rude , violent , brutal and it needs your obiedience . 
   i do n't understand why mussolini 's contribution to ` nazifascism ' does n't seem to be properly represented in this celebration . 
  do you expect us to be sad because italy lost the war ? 
  we are happy because the fascist italy lost the war , and a new republican , democratic italy was born . 
  celebrating the end of a regime , does n't mean denying the responsibility of the war . 
  to be honest , i am not sure you could understand as a british . 
  please read this again in the most polite way possible , because i do n't mean anything to say anything bad or rude , and give me a chance to explain in my broken english what it `` should '' mean to be italian . 
  your country existed for centuries . 
  i would not be surprised if you perceive to belong to the same country you were 200 hundreds years ago . 
  i would not be surprised if something the united kingdom did 200 hundreds years ago would be described by you using the term `` we '' . 
  this does n't apply in italy . 
  italy as a country did n't even existed 150 years ago . 
  do you think i may ever use the term `` we '' to describe what the holy see or the republic of venice did 200 years ago ? 
  as an italian i perceive that the kingdom of italy in 1940 was my country as much as the holy see in 1860 was my country . 
  it was not . 
  no sense of belonging at all . 
  some land , and some people , i know ... . 
  but it 's something very distant from a cultural and institutionally point of view . 
  everything we are today , everything related with our identity ( culturally , politically , institutionally , etc ... ) is a rejection of those dark days . 
  being italian today , means rejecting any form of totalitarism . 
  i do n't use the term `` we '' to describe what fascist did , but `` them '' . 
  as a country we are/were accountable , formally and institutionally , for what we did . 
  but today ? 
  today is a great day , because we were liberated from that heavy identity of a fascist regime . 
  that 's way it does n't feel a contradiction for us to celebrate the liberation of italy , because modern italy and today identity was born with the end of the fascism . 
  ok , so the probem is the name of the celebration . 
  it seems that it 's like judging the book from the cover , but if it 's that important let 's discuss about the name , then . 
  wikipedia : italy 's liberation day , also known as the anniversary of the resistance , or simply april 25 is a national italian holiday commemorating the end of the [ italian civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_civil_war ) and the end of nazi occupation of the country during world war ii . 
  2 years of civil war . 
  italian vs italian . 
  democracy won . 
  today we are grateful to the allied troops and to the italian resistance movement .
