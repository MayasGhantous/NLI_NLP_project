to be fair , that article on forbes was considered shit on most communities . 
  you may want to check out the thread on / r/economics which is populated by a large number of us citizens as well . 
  he was not found guilty for stealing , it seems there were irregularities in the hiring of some public employees ( florence province ) instead . 
  still illegal but not the same as `` stealing public money '', 
  adding some : * [ tinturia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuqye7wqlpm ) from agrigento , sicily * [ calibro 35 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxuroi4dzw ) from milan, 
  i absolutely agree on this , the south needs several reforms , maybe more than `` a bit '' . 
  but lowering interest rates and not printing money sounds like a contradiction to me . 
  what 's the point in lowering interest rates but not printing money ? 
  you 're helping deflation with this , are n't you ? 
  ** italy ** i did n't follow many events this week , maybe someone will add more . 
  there are some links in italian , so you can have a look with google translator if you want . 
  * [ debate on minister cancellieri ] ( http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2013-11-17/cancellieri-civati-presenta-sua-mozione-sfiducia-e-mette-tensione-pd-141257.shtml?uuid=abpmqld ) continues , a representative from pd ( partito democratico ) wants to remove her from office and should make a motion in a few days * berlusconi refounded his party , but [ most of the important politicians wo n't follow him ] ( http://qn.quotidiano.net/politica/2013/11/15/982574-cicchitto-pdl-berlusconi-falchi.shtml ) and will make another party with alfano ( leader of the split ) instead . 
  voters seem to be splitting as well . 
  ^ edit : ^ ( added a bit on deflation ), 
  sorry , it was actually the reconstitution of fascist party . 
  this is the bill : [ d.lgs . 
  n. 66/2010 art 2268 comma 297 ] ( http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/n2ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:2010;66 ) , and [ this ] ( http://guide.supereva.it/diritto/interventi/2001/11/78236.shtml ) is the law suppressed . 
  me neither . 
  by the way , too bad that ~ ~ ~ fascism apology ~ ~ ~ reconstitution of pnf is a costitutional crime , but the article on the penal code regulating it was suppressed by berlusconi 's govern , so it 's virtually legal . 
  we need a costitution article that denies bills like that, 
  italian here . 
  emphasized : roman history , we ( we ? ), 
  were the most powerful etc ( but i 'm in a italian secondary school specializing in classical studies , so i think it 's ok ) left out : basicly no one ** knows of ** or talks about italian war crimes . 
  if you tell an average italian that we killed thousands in colonial wars ( ethiopia , somalia , libya , slovenia , etc ) they go like `` wtf are you talking about '' . 
  worst part is that if you tell him we did have concentration camps in italy managed by italians , they 'll most likely reply `` nah germans did that shit , we 're fine '' . 
  this kind of behavior has been noticed and analyzed by nuomerous italian historians , eg [ italians , good people ? 
  ] ( http://www.ibs.it/code/9788854500136/del-boca-angelo/italiani-brava-gente?.html ) by del boca ( sorry i cold n't link anything in english ), 
  [ art . 
  i thought it was the english for `` etnia '' which is basicly `` race '' and answered consequently . 
  definetely needs to be clarified next time, 
  only among truckers and some radio enthusiast, 
  well it 's not easy to explain if you 're not into radio and cb , but they behave in a much similar way to [ italian ones ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=novmlbuzyde ) . 
  they 're basicly putting in their radios tons of mods in order to get a ultra-distorted modulation . 
  the best part is that they believe that this has a good effect on the radio 's power . 
  also , they often use illegal frequencies , just for the sake of . 
  their truck drivers are the most annoying 27mhz cb users in europe . 
  greek redditors , what is the affluence like compared to previous elections and pre-crisis ? 
  is people starting to lose interest ? 
  wikipedia as every other encyclopedia is a `` tertiary source '', 
  exactly , translating any latin poetry and keeping the metrics is extremely difficult . 
  even in prose , if you try to translate from latin to most languages , you will end up with something like 130 % the number of the original words . 
   they get temporary visa which basicly is the same as asylum . 
  are they getting welfare with a temporary visa ? 
   milan expensive though , especially compared to the rest of italy . 
  source ? 
  then i 'm afraid there are no enough migrants . 
  btw you spelled migrant wrong, 
  what is your proposal , out of the metaphor ? 
  this is not a pro-immigration speech , pretty much every politician in italy wants a common eu policy on migrants and simple mass immigration is not necessarily one for most . 
   while wasting billions on f-35s ( instead of paying even more money for manteinance on older planes ), 
  what kind of written test ? 
  on the law system ? 
   then they are clearly economic migrants i do n't know , it is not always that clear . 
  often people escape their land but also end up trying to get asylum in richer countries . 
  otherwise , there would be far less immigration in sweden and germany , for example . 
  i 'm not an international law expert , but these treaties are often considered fundamental human rights ( clearly not by you , though ) and exiting them would cause a lot of trouble with ngos such as un . 
   do they have aplications on them when they come in ? 
  of course not , how are they supposed to ask for it when they are not even in the application country ? 
  because asylum applicants . 
  this is exactly what i thought about my own country . 
  probably yes , it 's just reddit , but there has been some rioting as well in germany , so it 's probably real ( in smaller quantities than on / r/europe ), 
  macedonia is not in eu nor schengen area , so no big deal really . 
  i kind of expected this , macedonia was clearly not prepared and they could n't keep them forever . 
  i guess it 's up to serbia now , correct ? 
  yes , i totally agree with you , things have changed . 
  however sometimes even in our times it is really easy to be a victim of propaganda , and the fact that it used to happen 100 years ago makes it less hard to believe . 
   against anti-democratical and irrational government decisions as if rioting and beating both migrants and policemen is totally democratical and rational . 
  being in your own land does not entitle you to act like an idiot . 
  wars in the 20th century attracted a lot of teenagers who wanted something to fight for . 
  look at the spanish civil war . 
  since when rioting and injuring random policemen led to something ? 
  these people are no different from the violent migrants in macedonia . 
  are we supposed to post every single thing that happens in europe ? 
  i do n't get it , why are you posting this on / r/europe ? 
  on page 28 it just says `` co2 footprint '' , so i do n't know what to tell you . 
  from what i get on the subject , `` green '' silviculture is still considered sustainable . 
  50 percent is still a very big part , anyways . 
  some [ 2014 statistics ] ( http://digibook.digi-work.com/digibooks.aspx/get/cepi/1391/key_statistics_2014_finalpdf ) tl ; dr : a lot of the paper comes from recycling , and most of the wood used in the production of pulp is from eu silviculture ( oversimplifying a bit , that means that the trees are grown for the specific purpose and not just randomly cut down from a forest , and the same number of trees must be reintroduced ) co2 fingerprint is also stable , even though the productivity is getting higher . 
  ( sorry for the english , i 'm on a rush ), 
  most of the ( european , at least ) paper production is sustainable . 
  i just did n't realise that in germany landline phones are still that common . 
  `` they '' seems to refer to `` criminals '' in his sentence edit : that was the joke, 
  yes , criminals do indeed cause 100 % of the crimes . 
  which biases the data , because younger people are less likely to have a landline phone . 
  because it would make macedonia a non-safe country ? 
  \\ s no seriously , that 's exactly the reason why the police has tear gas in the first place . 
  i 'm more or less fine but / r/europe is not , to be honest . 
  far too much polarization , anger and unwillingness to have a serious debate , these days . 
  i feel like everyone is just seeing in black or white . 
  sorry , it had to be said . 
   not counting lodging i guess that the 19 eur include lodging expenses , though, 
  ironically , i 've heard of people moving to north africa . 
  although it should be said that a part of that money disapperars in corrupted associations and organizations , as the recent roman scandal pointed out . 
  many immigrants still end up being lodged in not-so-human conditions . 
  ofc i 'm not saying it 's not enough money , it should be more than needed . 
  as always , our problem is in organizing the way it 's spent . 
  this remembers me of when in 2001 berlusconi mailed 200k calculators as an electoral manuever . 
  til `` migrant '' implies `` terrorist '', 
  i guess we have two different ideas of `` nationalism '' . 
  like berlusconi in italy , that 's interesting .
