* well , fuck . 
  italy - ask why all italian men still live with their mothers by the age of 30 . 
  because we do n't we have the money necessary to move out . 
  i know it 's supposed to be a joke but people seriously think we do n't move out because we love our mommy too much . 
  - wear your seatbelt when in the car and imply that you do n't trust the driver 's skills . 
  i expect you to wear your seatbelt even if you trust my driving skills . . - tell them they look albanian . 
  wat - if they invite you to a restaurant , complain about italian cuisine . 
  you can piss anybody if you do that , not only italians . . 
  this is so lame . 
  i ca n't blame you , because of the internet i ca n't take italian words like `` fagotto , fagottino '' seriously anymore . 
  i am 27 . . 
  some from italy : bastardo ( no need to translate , i think ) bellano ( nice anus ) borgomale ( sounds like `` evilburg '' ) bulgarograsso ( `` fat bulgarian '' ) casa del diavolo ( house of the devil ) femminamorta ( deadfemale , i hope tumblr does n't find this one ) la california ( well . . 
  california . ), 
  misterbianco ( mr. 
  white . ), 
  merlino ( merlin . . ) mondragone ( dragon mountain ) nanto ( only hokuto no ken fans will get this ) onani ( ... ) strangolagalli ( cocks , as in the male chicken , strangler ), 
  thank you , we people from naples really appreciate that . 
  germany has a boner . . 
  naples , in southern italy , has a strong and old cult of the dead tradition , which was enough to worry the catholic church in the 60s , and lead the pope to officially condemn it in 1969 \uff0e, 
  you foreigners really do n't get it right ? 
  that 's not how you use that gesture !, 
  no one seems to understand !, 
  bashing japan is a fad on reddit . 
  every thread about japan ends with wwii and whales . 
  san marino 's flag is quite ironic . 
  hurr durr i 've run out of arguments so i resort to personal attacks . 
   there is something quite cool about saying `` here 's 5 dollars '' like in the movies this . . this is what hollywood did to us !, 
  we find american money `` cool '' !, 
  we know about america more than we should !, 
  why should we know where americans go when they go for groceries ? 
  but we know !, 
  hollywooooooooood !, 
  yes , yes . 
  i 've seen much of old japan . 
  but still is different from walking around and bumping in a historical site at every corner . 
  that is what i meant . 
  `` italy has more history '' is different from `` japan has no history '' . 
  look at the facts and try again . 
  yeah , old edo was pretty much destroyed . 
  but still , edo did n't become a center of power before the 17th century , before it was just a tiny fishermen 's village . 
  yes , my favourite place in japan is still nara , which was the capital in the 8th century . 
  how come i cam a `` euronationalists '' just by saying my city has more history than japan ? 
  lol . 
  it is a fact . 
  you talk about the jomon period like `` ancient culture '' . 
  the jomon period is a prehistoric period . 
  i was n't considering that , and even if we consider that , we have to consider prehistoric history of italy then . 
  and it does n't change nothing . 
  and how is this multiculturalism thing even related to the discourse ? 
  lol this makes no sense . 
  this is hilarious because the poster somehow thinks i do n't like it here he knows about japan much more than me . 
  my hometown in italy is 2800 years old , much more than any still existing japanese town . 
  the usual food stuff aside , i miss living in a city where i can feel history . 
  tokyo is a awesome city but everything is so . . modern , and new . 
  concrete everywhere . 
  my hometown alone has a much longer history than the whole country i live in now . 
  the only pizza is neapolitan pizza . 
  the guy who says pizza is the same as in the north is clearly crazy . 
  i think it is fascinating that people get actually interested in other european countries through stuff like polandball and paradox games . 
  ** naples , italy ** ** federico ii university ** first state university in history ( 1224 ) ** giordano bruno ( 1548-1600 ) ** philosopher , mathematician , astrologer and astronomer ** gian lorenzo bernini ** prominent artist and architect ( 1598-1660 ) ** giambattista vico ** philosopher , historian and jurist ( 1668-1744 ) ** pentameron ** first fairy tale collection in european literary history ( 1634 , giambattista basile ) ** renato carosone ** world famous musician ( 1920-2001 ) ** sophia loren ** ( 1934 -- ) , actress ** largest historic centre in europe ** ** pizza ** no need to explain . 
  and many others i think . . 
  [ fucking gustavus adolphus ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlt0lerdgks ), 
  japanese internet as a whole is stuck in the 90s . . 
  if berlusconi wins , i am going to throw away my citizenship as soon as i can . 
  which is not the point of this discussion . 
  coperto is not tipping . 
  it covers bread , dishes and cutlery . 
  when i studied abroad i was continuosly ( mostly by germans ) harassed because the italians are considered `` momma 's boys '' . 
  while it is true that as this show italian people leave home quite late in their 20s , this mostly depend on economical reasons . 
  it is almost impossible to leave as a student . 
  hell , some of us ca n't leave even if we get a job because wages are low and housing prices are high . 
  rex was a huge hit in italy too . 
  used to watch it a lot when i was a kid . 
  there it is again , the romanian with the american jokes, 
  jobs ? 
   aversion to spicy food what ? 
  the scene where the kestrel kills and eat the mouse from the group scarred me for life . 
  `` you are eating my wife ! '' . 
  people still make jokes about this in italy . 
  everyone here seems to absorb american culture , including jokes and racial slures . 
  i was really perplexed when a romanian user here called italians `` greasy guidos '', 
  there 's a road named after j. f. kennedy in my city in italy too . 
  well , we also have one named after the soviet union nearby . 
  makes sense since a lot of cities in the south were founded by the greeks !, 
  you are always someone else 's terrones, 
  yeah insulting the greek people is bad . 
  meanwhile , let 's just insult a specific area of another country, 
  the life and times of scrooge mcduck is still the best comic book series ever written . 
  we make our own donald duck comics , and i think norway and denmark do too, 
  ah , games without frontiers . 
  it was really popular in italy too , and definitely something i was looking forward to during the summer months as a kid . 
  happy to see we have some european-wide shared good memories of it !, 
  golden carolus tripel, 
  wrong stereotype . . 
  that looks more like a zaku bootleg . . 
  abe ? 
  really ? 
  the problem is , the japanese love that walking stereotype . 
  i remember seeing a regular , plain looking italian guy in a japanese variety show being told `` why could n't we get an italian man like giro-san ? '' . 
  never seen him again .
