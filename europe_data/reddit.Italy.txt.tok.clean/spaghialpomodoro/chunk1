i did n't invoce the oath . 
  i think it 's empty words . 
  who gives a shit , frankly . 
  there 's no best one , it 's too personal . 
  i mean , the difference between val d'aosta and puglia is more or less the difference between the north and dorne . 
  anyhow , i 'm toootally biased , but i 'd go with sardegna . 
  you have no idea what it was like to travel in europe/meet foreigners during his last government . 
  the jokes , so many many jokes ... 
  jesus christ that was the year he came to roma with soldiers with swords riding camels . 
  he slept somewhere in the capital in his tent . 
  berlusconi kissed his hand . 
  dear heaven i had forgotten , i think i 'm gon na puke, 
  his election is the second oldest political memory i have . 
  they showed it live at school during lunch break when i was 6 . 
  the oldest is my family talking about elections and my aunt calling bossi , fini and berlusconi `` a bunch of assholes '' in ' 96 . 
  at least we clean our ass, 
  i 'm 30 min away from milano . 
  before they went into hiding ( more or less ) my neighbour 's surname was rispoli . 
  you 're such a sweet guy . 
  and italy is not an extreme example , and tell me , what positive outcome on the economy would we have destroying a good chunk of italian buisness-owners ? 
  as far as i can remember italy is among of the richest countries on earth and has been for the last 50-60 years , even without letting big foreign corporation screw its local seaside economies . 
  you are seriously comparing us to venezuela ? 
  `` the laws of market '' do you really believe in something like that ? 
  some 80 years too late . 
  anyway , i just had a couple glasses of white . 
  i hope what 's next for him is shittier than 41bis . 
  [ yeah well ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/industry/manufacturing%2c-value-added/current-us%24 ), 
  at least we still have a manifacturing industry, 
  last time i saw a western country do something * so * stupid was the last time we gave berlusconi power . 
  thank you mates, 
  not all italians , just those from vicenza , 
  do i need to pay 12 bucks for 40 mb ? 
  i spent 12 $ for roaming 4 days in prague , 3 $ / day to get 200 mb , 60 sms and less than 30 minutes of call-time per day . 
  that 's not all , this shit autoinitiate itself everytime i used something ( sms/internet/call ) and lasted not 24 hours , but from the moment i used it til midnight . 
  i had no particular problem spending them because i have a shit ton of money on my sim ( thanks to grandma , she still think it 's 2006 ) and i really needed google maps , but shit i used less than 40 mb in those 4 days . 
  unacceptable, 
  today in milano it felt like it was may . 
  hot , flowers and leaves on trees , people in shorts ... too bad pollen allergies ruin everythin, 
  some of the best chocolate in the world is made there, 
  take this ny !, 
  if that 's the case we 'll change science . 
  we 'll make her an offer she ca n't refuse, 
  iirc the materials used to make these dresses simply are n't made anymore, 
  well i think basically dead , the knowhow to make them and the needed materials is lost . 
  my family still has a couple i think , obv just for the processioni, 
  for those interested , [ here ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/tamata80/sets/72157667368480062 ) 's the flickr album i took it from . 
  every town in sardegna has a set of traditional dresses , and the difference between them are sometimes pretty big . 
  maybe . 
  but do you think italians and spaniards do n't report homicides ? 
  because women are killed at higher rate in northern europe than italy/spain edit : i 'm all for free entry for women on 8 march , and i know first hand that equality on workplace/society is shitty in italy compared to other nations . 
  on the matter of violence it 's not that clear cut . 
  we are not niger and they are not utopia, 
  well yes , dolce as opposed to `` intenso , forte '', 
  we have something similar !, 
  `` del maiale non si butta via niente '' ( basically `` a pig has no waste '' ) and `` del maiale si mangia tutto '' ( `` you can eat the whole pig '' ), 
  they are different products . 
  spanish hams are very intense , more akin to the prosciutti crudi made in central italy ( toscana/umbria , i 'd even say those they make in sardegna ) than to the crudo di parma or crudo san daniele , which are waaay more delicate . 
  it 's a matter of personal taste if you prefer something like crudo di parma or something like the spanish ones . 
  i had very good stuff from spain , but nothing that blew out of the table the best italian stuff ( which is obv easier than the spanish one to get in italy ), 
  well you could compare it with prosciutto crudo , which is n't cooked . 
  that would be fair . 
  you got ta be fucking kidding, 
  * hotels are expensive , but if you manage to find a b&b / airbnb/whatever you should be fine . 
  * food can be very expensive if you do n't know where to eat , or shit if you go for the inexpensive choices if you ca n't figure out which are tourist bullshit and which are n't . 
  * transportation is shitty , taxy are a big nono ( $ $ $ $ $ $ $ ) , ferries are a bit over the top with their prices ( nothing crazy like the taxis but pretty high anyway , 9 $ or atound that price for 3km ) , trains are ok price-wise but you lose all the scenario . 
  a car is definitley the best way , if conbined with the ferry you can see everything , but cars are expensive and parking is shitty . 
  with that said , it 's one of the most gorgeous places in the whole world . 
  i spent a lot of time there with my grandma , i also wrote [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/58cxse/visiting_varenna_venice_octobernovember/d91v3d9/?st=iujxzonm&amp;sh=4090b0e0 ) comment about stuff around varenna - if you have any question , feel free to ask . 
  did n't the last berlusconi government abrogate that law after the dumbass himself dropped one while telling a chauvinist joke about an opposition 's politician ? 
  edit zio caro relevant username, 
  `` better a dead kin in the house than a pisan knocking on the door '' , livorno and pisa are our india and pakistan without nuclear weapons, 
  i 'm going to fight you over the ronaldo claim . 
  with swords . 
  and fire . 
  by area ravenna is huge , obv by population roma milano napoli, 
  yes italy !, 
  yes art conservationism !, 
  ravenna , i think . 
  milano is way smaller edit ma cazzo downvotate, 
  corse does not exist it seems, 
  alex del piero !, 
  i do n't think he was talking about politics : ), 
  being an industrial town bombed during the war and rebuilt for the same purpose has that effect . 
  a pity , before the war the city center was stunning , now there 's little left, 
  i did in summer ' 13 . 
  nice city but every slovak i met made sure to remind us of wc10 :(, 
  they were [ cossacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cossacks ) and they came from somewhere between ukraine and russia but it 's quite possible friulans called them mongols , after all i do n't think uneducated italians in 1944 ( or even now ) had half an idea of whatever lied east of budapest at the time . 
  yes by the way , i know some people from there and i heard such stories . 
  the italian wiki page about [ carnia ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnia#storia ) has some stuff about the matter , but i ca n't find external sources . 
  cool story : hitler had some cossacks soldiers that fought for him and promised them a `` kosakenland in italie '' or something like that . 
  they went in carnia ( friuli ) and messed around until the liberation , when the allies forced them to go back to russia ... to stalin ... whom they betrayed . 
  knowing that meant death some committed suicide by riding on horseback into a frozen lake in hungary . 
  i now know what i should do in life, 
  northern italy . 
  it 's a plain , tons of cars , a lot of factories , no wind , it 's fuckin shit . 
  i hate breathing here, 
  the inside was decored again by christians . 
  a lot of rinascimento vip ( eg raffaello ) are tumulated there, 
  quitaly is an excellent italian blogger btw, 
  i was just having breakfast now imma puke,
