  you 're not missing anything, 
   for no reason because he can , and because he 's an asshole, 
  english and french , or just one of the two ? 
  i live in a metropolis and i dream the alps every single day, 
  i wonder what happens if you go to finland and call them `` fake swedish '', 
  from the latin `` downvotus '', 
  [ relevant post ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fcxar/i_spent_3_months_travelling_around_the_eu_alone_i/ctnu863 ) , 
  most italian cities are fucking amazing . 
  just stay away from naples , that 's it . 
  as a roman , many roman waiters and shop owners are absolute garbage , rude idiots . 
  i especially hate it when they do n't even know you and they start making jokes or even make fun of you , so extremely unprofessional . 
  do n't take it personally , it happens to everybody , not only tourists . 
  thank god i do n't live there anymore . 
   so my least favorite city in my european travels so far , i 'd say venice . 
  and again , it 's not `` bad '' ... but it 's cramped , not the cleanest place , and all . 
  i agree . 
  everybody always wants to go to venice while completely ignoring the surrounding region of veneto , which is absolutely amazing . 
  it 's a shame really . 
  it 's a literal translation from italian . 
  we say * sentire l'odore * which , taken literally , means `` feeling the smell '', 
  london has money . 
  this map does n't mean much to the individual person anyway . 
  you can be happy in london and miserable in trondheim ( i know i would , it 's in the middle of fucking nowhere ) . 
  london is a shit place to be honest . 
  most people are only here because of all the jobs, 
  if you can visit just one of the cities in veneto other than venice , i suggest verona . 
  if you can squeeze a visit to trentino , i 'd recommend the stelvio pass and the resia pass , ending up in the resia lake . 
  but i 'm sure you can find a lot of info online . 
  no i do n't live in italy anymore , i had to move to the uk 2 years ago because salaries in italy are a joke . 
  hopefully i can go back in a few years , but i do n't see the situation improving anytime soon . 
  edit : there are a ton of awesome places in the alps near como , no need to go to trentino unless you want to check out a specific place , 
  jealous ? 
  i take it you 've never been to italy before if you think that street is incredible  you 'll have a great time in veneto . 
  actually i 'll be there in september too for my annual visit :p just be aware that venice is essentially a giant tourist trap . 
  i suggest staying somewhere else in veneto , for example verona , vicenza , or padova , which is the closest to venice but also my least favourite of the three . 
  you can get a cheap train ride to venice from any of those cities , i 'd just go on a 1 day trip there if i were you . 
  do n't go to any restaurants in venice unless you 're going with a local . 
  avoid gondola rides unless you like burning money . 
  there 's so much more in veneto other than venice , the best option in my opinion is to rent a car and just drive around ( but go to venice by train ) . 
  some places off the top of my head : * verona - probably my favourite city in italy * vicenza - lived there for a year , loved it , hopefully i 'll be able to go back if the economy gets better . 
  nice lively ( during summer ) city centre , and you can get a view of the whole town from monte berico . 
  the basilica palladiana is there , but villas by [ andrea palladio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrea_palladio ) are scattered throughout the region * padova * marostica - they play [ human chess ] ( https://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/256615.jpg ) here every year * cittadella - nice small medieval town * bassano del grappa - famous for being the `` birthplace '' of [ grappa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grappa ) * asiago - famous for the asiago cheese * pedavena - tiny town in the alps , locals often go [ here ] ( http://labirreriapedavena.com/ ) to get drunk if you like mountains , visit trentino alto adige . 
  if you have any other questions feel free to ask, 
  he 's saying exactly that, 
  1:28  ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) seriously , cool video . 
  seems like you had a great time !, 
  i hope you did n't get ripped off too much in venice, 
  that 's ok , i was n't asking for myself , but thanks nonetheless . 
  i have a friend who 's been looking for a while with no luck . 
  he speaks good german , and has a master degree from a top italian uni . 
  i 've heard getting into the automotive industry , as a mechanical engineer , is not actually * that * easy anymore . 
  is that true ? 
  do n't quote me on this but i 'm pretty sure italy was in a recession in the 70s after the economic miracle of the 60s, 
  it 's the [ beer ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vnwvgjg.jpg ) that albanian construction workers drink at 8am in rome . 
  i was very surprised to discover that you guys actually have draft peroni here and seem to like it . 
  maybe it 's better than the one in the can ? 
  i 'll have to try it . 
  been here 2 years and still have n't had one . 
  also , they have some amazing marketing here in the uk . 
   peroni not sure if making fun of me, 
  sorry , i was once taught by a german that a pint should last half an hour . 
  maybe he was lying to me, 
  take a sip , stare awkwardly at other people , then go home, 
  it 's probably because i 'm usually either at home or in the office . 
  to be honest it 's a very rare sight in central london too, 
  italian parents would maybe give you money to stay , not ask for it !, 
  and that 's milan . . 
  yes but people often seem to forget how big the italian economy is, 
  he 's trying to be funny playing the stereotypical american who does n't know about geography . 
  italy and ireland have similar flags and maybe in his mind a similar name . 
   old news , basically all major european countries ( germany , uk , italy , spain and france ) yay we 're a major country !, 
  we 're a major country !!, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ ^ overdoing ^ ^ ^ ^ it, 
  having a dual boot is a pain , plain and simple . 
  i had it in the past but i ended up always using windows because it 's more convenient having games and everything else available at all times without having to restart, 
  less games . 
  harder to make some things work . 
  mostly the game thing though . 
  windows 8 just works out of the box for me , and never breaks randomly, 
  i hate to agree with you on this because i ca n't stand facebook , but yeah you 're right, 
  i think at least 3 , i 'm on my phone right now so i ca n't check, 
  maybe you should tell us where you 're from :p, 
   8/10 would recommend others and i think over all national conscription has a positive effect on my country and those who choose to complete it . 
  do you think this is because finland is a small country population wise , and `` you 're all in it together '' against russia ? 
  italy had conscription up until 10/15 years ago , and we hated it . 
  i suppose it 's because we do n't have any immediate threat , whether real or perceived , like finland . 
  we also definitely saw it as slavery and without purpose . 
  personally i 'm thankful i did n't have to waste a year of my life listening to some idiot yell orders at me . 
  so the internet works with bananas ? 
  on a serious not , what can they do in this case other than telling me to use linux ? 
  the thing about italy is we do n't make jokes about `` italians '' or any other nationality specifically . 
  we do have some jokes that start with `` a french , a german and an italian go to a bar . . '' , but the most common target are the * carabinieri * , one of our police forces . 
  1 billion americans and europeans eating all this meat are a bit too many already, 
  what % of cows are running freely though ? 
  i think the majority are born in factory farms . 
  we need to eat less meat , i do n't think there 's any other way around it, 
  no no no you idiot . 
  it 's only because of 0 hour contracts . 
  it 's only the top 1 % making the money while the rest of us are poorer than ever . 
  you wo n't be missed , snoop,
