  that was 37 years ago , what do you want us to comment ? 
  he 's just saying that the poles have had it worse for a long time so he does n't have any sympathy for the greeks . 
  at least that 's my take . 
   `` god protect me from those i trust , i 'll protect myself from those whom i do not '', 
   the average price of a house there [ london ] right now is nearly # 600,000 it was 440k less than 2 years ago , if i remember correctly, 
  no , that 's just germany, 
   it 's like they 're trying to make themselves look like idiots deliberately . 
  we have that in italy too , just search for `` test drive maranello '' on youtube, 
  i do n't understand, 
  this is gon na end badly, 
  what countries in the eu are in recession apart from greece and finland ? 
  still , many people do n't like looking at actual , although pixelated , corpses, 
  ok , we actually agree to a degree then . 
  i think we misunderstood each other from the beginning . 
  in my original post i was `` mocking '' northern europeans , although the same applies to north americans , for thinking that pasta and oil are the devil and then going to starbucks or eating a double blue cheese burger . 
  thank you for your smug one-liners ( education ? 
  * wink wink * ) that do n't answer any of my questions . 
  link me something at least, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the food pyramid ? 
  we italians live longer and are [ thinner ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/0,,16820851_4,00.jpg ) than most europeans , yet we use a lot of olive oil and eat a lot of pasta . 
  clearly they must not be the most evil things in the universe . 
  it took [ 41 years ] ( http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/07/22/strage-di-piazza-della-loggia-ergastolo-per-maggi-e-tramonte-in-appello/1898399/ ) to give a life sentence to 2 guys for killing 8 people and injuring 100 . 
  the only way we 're getting rid of berlusconi is by either sending him to russia or him dying, 
  what is it with northern europe and the hate of carbs and olive oil ? 
  i do n't think we agree on the meaning of * sounds *, 
  it * sounds * italian though . 
  * starts and ends with a vowel * does n't have more than 3 consonants in a row * `` ndr '' and `` ghe '' are common combinations in italian * does n't have a crazy amount of consonants like finnish * uses italian letters i have no idea how this word can sound `` 100 % foreigner '' to an italian . 
  it 's this happening in every country ? 
  really ? 
  it actually does sound like an italian word , just one that had the first letter stolen from it . 
  do n't act like you do n't love the mafia 's money , 
   suomi mainittu rajalla tavataan finland mentioned the border is found ? 
  maybe not tomorrow but it happens more than i 'd like . 
  oh , he did n't kill her ? 
  he 'll be released tomorrow . . 
  is this finally it ? 
  well i 'd like to come back to italy sooner or later , so yes, 
  i need to move to svalbard, 
  unless you live in the very centre you hop on a car and you 're out in 20 minutes, 
  i 'm trying to say i would n't want to live in a city so big or a town so small , but i 'd prefer something in between, 
  i do n't know galway at all really , my bad for not being clear . 
  i meant that both living in london and in a place in the middle of nowhere is n't great, 
  much more so than london , and it 's much smaller . 
  plus it feels safer/less sketchy and it 's easier to get out of the city if you want to spend a weekend out, 
   i know what you mean . 
  i 've been here for 2 years and i 'm moving back to rome this year . 
  it feels like a small town in comparison . 
  ca n't wait to go back . 
  yes , that 's the best thing , living close to a decently sized town . 
  living in london is madness , good luck with your plans . 
  mid sized cities are the best imho . 
  london and galway are both problematic, 
   france , italy , spain ... yep , agree completely, 
  that 's what he said, 
  thanks for the explanation , 
  simply not possible . 
  it takes 30 minutes , not including the walk to and from the stations , to get from zone 3 to zone 1 , and if you want to live by yourself in zone 3 in a decent flat you 're going to spend , i do n't know , at least 1300 pounds per month ? 
  and you have to add transport costs to that , which is another ~ # 160 monthly i think . 
  add food and a bit of fun and you 're going to spend close to 2000 pounds every month . 
  would you do that if you made # 2500 a month ? 
  probably not . 
  yep, 
  i count five , but that might just be me . 
   rszcz why . 
  just . . why ? 
  well , i got a bit carried away by the comparison to london . 
  that , and the depressing threads you see on / r/unitedkingdom . . and [ this ] ( http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/are-9-of-the-poorest-regions-in-northern-europe-really-in-the-uk--ej0axhcqmx ), 
  in london you feel like you 're at the centre of the world . 
  it 's essentially a giant business area where people from all over europe , and the world , come to make money . 
  anyone can get a job here . 
  unemployment is low , and there are so so many companies where you can have a nice career if you have the right qualifications . 
  also , the article says :  the 6 % who fall into the top `` elite '' class have , on average , a household income of # 89k working in the city of london i 'm surrounded by people who make that on a single salary . 
  i would n't be surprised to discover that 90 % of that 6 % lives in london or in the south-east of england ( aka london communters ) . 
  basically , if you visit london you might get the impression that the uk is doing great , but that 's not the case . 
  if you go anywhere else in england ( not to mention wales ) you realise that london is the exception and the rest of the country is doing rather poorly . 
  i have n't been to scotland yet but looking at some charts it 's not that different from the poor parts of england , with the exception of a couple of places where they have oil like aberdeen , which have been suffering lately due to the recent fall in oil prices . 
  and another thing you do n't realise as a tourist are the rent prices in london . 
  a salary of # 50k a year might sound like a lot if you do n't live in london or zurich , but it 's not even enough to live comfortably on your own here . 
  basically it only makes sense if you want to stay here for a few years , or if your salary is beyond ridiculous . 
  the more i live in london the more i realise i 'm in a bubble . 
  it 's kinda depressing :(, 
  i 'm from rome actually :p, 
  welcome to europe , where italians live in the uk and learn swedish , 
  i should have . 
  i was young and stupid . 
  i honestly do n't remember much apart from the wall and potsdamer platz . 
  it just did n't strike me as a particularly beautiful city . 
  not saying that london is beautiful , because i do n't like it . . but there is objectively so so much to see here . 
  that said i 'd much rather prefer a place like munich . 
   not just startups but basic things like tourism what 's there to see in berlin apart from the wall ? 
  honest question . 
  i was there once years ago and i do n't remember much . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  lol i 'm talking about the startups in london  it seems to me someone 's super jelly . 
  i live in london 2 . 
  why would i give a shit about a city 's `` startup scene '' ? 
  well it 's not a surprise really is it : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_city, 
  i see , cheers . 
  i suppose amazon killed many of those a while ago .
