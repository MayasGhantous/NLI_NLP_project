  maybe i 'm too young to remember , but what 's `` hisoign '' ? 
  london might be number one but honestly the quality of many startups is dreadful . 
  it 's all about `` adtech '' , `` fintech '' , or yaasu , * yet another analytics startup * . 
  just take a look [ here ] ( https://www.siliconmilkroundabout.com/companies ) . 
   powering the mad men of the modern age . 
  we 're a growing tech company in the booming ad-tech industry with a nimble approach to a global problem . 
  or  we help make the digital world personal by using cutting-edge tech to get our clients closer to their customers yawn . 
  [ one tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/hashtag/letseurostar?src=hash&amp;lang=en-gb ) as of now, 
  so what country is left with decent privacy laws ? 
  norway ? 
   italo is made by alstom btw :p . 
  yes , the * frecciarossa * and * frecciargento * follow the route naples-rome-florence-milan-turin i think . 
  many more high speed lines are planned . 
  we also have * italo * , [ one of the fastest trains ] ( http://www.railway-technology.com/features/feature-top-ten-fastest-trains-in-the-world/ ) in the world . 
  what i meant to say is that we are definitely capable of building good trains . 
  our slow `` regional '' trains suck , i know , but that 's probably true all over the world . 
  also if some trains are late that 's because of strikes or poor management , not because the train itself is poor quality . 
  and to be honest , i 've never been late when using a freccia train . 
  we have some of the best trains in europe, 
   you 'll get used to it , over time . 
  or not . 
  after 3 years i ca n't wait to go back home , and it 's only getting worse . 
  might be because the standard of living in london is shit unless you 're on # 100k/year . 
  but also seeing your family and life long friends twice a year sucks big time . 
  why did you ask me then ? 
  wikipedia says [ you are ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe ), 
  self loathing ? 
  i love europe and would n't want to spend my life anywhere else, 
   i was born in romania , now living in italy 10 years . 
  italy and italians disgust me . 
  sounds like you need to go back to romania then, 
  i do n't know , weirdly i think there are better pastries here in london . . lol . 
  i 've also heard amazing things about puglia/the south , but i have n't been there in ages . 
  that might just be me biased against roman restaurants . 
  i do n't particularly like them to be honest , for both food and service quality . 
  i meant the average cornetto in rome is pretty shameful . 
  there are some good pasticcerie but on average we 're not the best at desserts in the capital . 
  and our cornetti ( croissants ) are generally fucking awful, 
  10 % is not a lot ? 
  i 've never heard the exact term , but `` pasta in bianco '' and sometimes `` pizza in bianco '' refer to pasta and pizza without tomatoes , for example pasta with just olive oil and parmiggiano could be referred to as `` pasta in bianco '' . 
  so maybe cucina bianca means cooking with no tomato sauce ? 
  eheh , me too . 
  i hope to go back soon . 
  where in italy would you like to go ? 
  anyway there 's plenty of good food here . 
  the greenwich market should be close to you , right ? 
  and the borough market ( london bridge ) should be no more than 30 minutes from cutty sark by tube, 
  are there no jobs for you in paris ? 
  i do n't know anything around that area unfortunately . 
  the closest places are probably [ this ] ( http://www.amicimiei.co.uk/ ) ( they 're actually italian ) and a pizza place in stratford westfield , i think it was [ this one ] ( http://www.francomanca.co.uk/restaurants/westfield/ ) but i 'm not 100 % sure . 
  a lot of people also like rosso pomodoro but i 'm not a fan of neapolitan pizza . 
  there 's an unfortunate lack of take a way sliced pizza , the only good place i found so far is [ pizza rossa ] ( http://pizzarossa.com/locations/ ), 
  oh god , not going to start this argument . 
  i do n't know where they originate from , but they are very common in trentino-alto adige . 
  yes i 'm talking about zone 1-2 of london, 
   stuffed with chopped veal 's lung and spleen that have been boiled and then fried in lard sounds , erhm . . disgusting . . : /, 
  never heard of it, 
  ok i just got back home , here are some : * [ canederli ] ( http://ricette.giallozafferano.it/canederli-alla-tirolese-knodel.html ) , can be done in a million different ways * my mom 's lasagna , obviously * cheese with olive paste and or honey * as a vegetarian it pains to admit that there are few things as good as [ pizza bianca with mortadella ] ( https://i.imgur.com/yv0cvt5.jpg ) , many cured meats are incredible as well ( the only real rival in my book is the spanish jamon iberico ) * i have n't found good ice cream anywhere outside of italy yet , and i have been to half of europe . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.dissapore.com/grande-notizia/100-migliori-gelaterie-artigianali-2015/ ) are some of the best ice cream places in the country . 
  i 've been to number 13 recently and it 's just insane . 
  * anything with truffles , [ random example ] ( http://www.originalitaly.it/it/ricette/r-risotto-al-tartufo-e-noci-su-flan-di-verza-e-gelato-al-castelmagno ) * bruschettas . 
  there are hundreds of variations . 
  simplest one is probably with cherry tomatoes , [ real olive oil ] ( http://www.actondileporano.com/index.php/it/prodotti/monovarietali/vendita-olio-extravergine-oliva-ottobratica ) , and [ real balsamic vinegar ] ( http://www.acetaiamalpighi.it/en/collection/saporoso-riserva-2/ ) . 
  balsamic vinegar is incredible actually , look [ how dense ] ( https://youtu.be/xxdpkcvn1ww?t=213 ) it 's supposed to be . 
  pasta : * [ puttanesca ] ( http://ricette.giallozafferano.it/spaghetti-alla-puttanesca.html ) * [ cacio e pepe ] ( http://ricette.giallozafferano.it/spaghetti-cacio-e-pepe.html ) * [ fuoco di bacco ] ( http://www.fragolosi.it/primi/spaghetti-al-fuoco-di-bacco/ ) i 'm a simple man . 
  yeah but you have to speak polish : /, 
  just got back home , i actually have [ 22 results ] ( http://www.originalitaly.it/it/ricette/search/?recipestype=0&amp;keyword=spinaci ) for `` spinaci '', 
  unfortunately domino exists too here in london :(, 
  search for * spinaci * on the website !, 
  please do n't go to pizza hut though , you have your fair share of good pizza places in london, 
  i think he was making a joke, 
   i mean it 's fucking pizza , there 's not much you can do . 
  was good . 
  i 'm sorry but you 're wrong here, 
  once a week ? 
  sounds about right, 
  honestly i 'm not an expert . 
  just avoid fish and expensive meats and most of the recipes are pretty cheap i think, 
  a simple but awesome cake !, 
  my favourite italian is the millefoglie , but nothing beats the sachertorte i have to admit . 
  i 'm not a big fan of cakes though, 
  no problem , those two are n't exactly easy to get right though . 
  hit me up if you need simpler recipes , or better yet just ask on / r/italy . . , 
   but well , it could use ** moar meat ** we 're fine , thanks :p, 
  i 'll give you two , one from the north and one from the south . 
  purple * canederli * at kugler 's speckstube in dobbiaco , and * spaghetti al fuoco di bacco * at la torre infame in castrovillari, 
  where in italy ? 
  maybe in the rural south ? 
  i 've never seen any `` cool kids '' at mcdonald 's anywhere i 've ever been . 
  i 'm sure they 'd be all over starbucks if we had that though, 
  yep , many restaurants in italy do n't even have pizza . 
  if you want pizza you usually go to a * pizzeria * or * pizzeria ristorante * , where they have both pizza and other dishes, 
  do n't have time right now . 
  maybe i 'll post some tonight  the thing is most of my favourites are probably not even on this list . 
  i 'll just leave you with the worst , shittiest and blandest of them all , but a staple of my diet from when i lived in rome ( you can only find them there ) . 
  it 's got sentimental value for me more than anything else . 
  the [ suppli ] ( http://ricette.giallozafferano.it/suppli-al-telefono.html ) . 
  no idea why it 's called * zuppa inglese * . 
  lol . 
  do n't forget the tomato writing on the plate !,
