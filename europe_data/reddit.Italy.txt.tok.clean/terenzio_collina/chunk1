despite being hard workers sweet british hypocrisy . 
  the concept is not right . 
  the government cars are n't luxury sports cars , but lancia , mercedes , audi , bmw , etc. 
  like every other country . 
   a generation of italy 's best and brightest are now living in the uk  speaking as one sure m8 . 
  how is the pizzeria going on ? 
   government lamborghinis for every senator what the fuck are you talking about . 
  your hopes are in vain with the anglo press . 
  i 'd say * better * than many other eu countries . 
  only french and british armed forces are clearly superior and better equipped . 
  realistically , poland has more weight within the eu . 
  france or spain . 
  he is putting into practice the election results , i.e. 
  the will of his people . 
  i do n't see where the problem is . 
  atlanticism is the main problem of europe . 
  you can choose between the [ 50 world heritage sites ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/it/ ) . 
  god bless communism . 
  the two things are not mutually exclusive . 
  are we talking about immigrants or native swedes ? 
   growth and employment it means public spending , opposed to austerity . 
  i hate christians too . 
   ( i love italy ) it seems you like more the hollywood-italy than the real history . 
  can you make an example of those laws ?

  hre was dominated by rome during middle ages , more or less until protestant reformation . 
  see [ humiliation of canossa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walk_to_canossa ) for more info . 
  italy was still the center of the world during middle ages ( the pope , maritime republics , first universities , etc. 
  ) , and again during renaissance . 
  you should review your anglocentric world . 
  most of the italian debt is owned by italian citizens . 
  is it illegitimate ? 
   just 20 years later germany was rebuilt out of scratch and became the strongest nation again [ germany was n't the strongest nation , that 's why it lost again . 
  it 's a survey among few countries .

  yes , all italians see their future in a european federation , even the nationalists call for it . 
   go to trentino and you 'll probably be very surprised . 
  i was born and raised 30 km from it . 
  cavour aircraft carrier , horizon-class destroyer ( your type 45 is just a copy of it ) , fremm frigate , type 212 submarine . 
   just because your nation is a fucking shitthole nowadays my nation today is better than in any other era in history . 
  i do n't know what are you talking about . 
   italian military tech is less developed . 
  true about the entire military . 
  not at all about navy tech . 
   anti-uk attitude contrary to italy which is so loved on this subreddit . 
  lol, 
   united states are for a low public spending what ?!, 
  their military budget is higher than a medium country 's gdp . 
  italy is not powerful , just like the uk . 
  the `` rule britannia '' times are gone . 
  i was referring to gdp per capita . 
  lombardy , even if it is n't the richest in the statistics ( just like bawu ) , is the industrial backbone of the country ( exactly like bawu ) . 
  the government of renzi is pro-eu and it is n't against austerity . 
  the first thing he did when he came to government was to reassure merkel about it . 
   very little interest in foreign policy by its best politicians so true . 
  not all italians are against austerity . 
  public spending in italy means wasting money on unnecessary works . 
  we need to streamline the state and lower taxes on labor . 
  what 's the point of using total gdp ? 
  china would be the richest nation in the world . 
  personally , i see no moral problem in rejecting illegal immigrants . 
  i do n't know what data you have seen , but lazio has never been in second place . 
  today , the regions with the most gdp per capita are trentino-south tyrol and aosta valley ( small regions with basically no industrial sector ) , then there are lombardy , emilia-romagna , veneto and finally lazio . 
  not even lombardy has the highest gdp in italy , but it is the most economically and industrially active region . 
  i had already figured out what you meant , in fact i mentioned the two most productive regions of the two countries . 
  they are very similar . 
  i think lombardy and baden-w\u00fcrttemberg are both equally rich , maybe a little more the german region now because italy is in stagnation since 2000s . 
   they are italian speaking , that is a fact . 
  but i do n't know who you think you are not being from trentino yourself and telling them what they are . 
  let them decide for themselves . 
  in trentino no one has any doubt about what they are , apart from some habsburg nostalgic and reactionary monarchists . 
  cesare battisti is still a hero there . 
  south tyrol is a different kettle of fish . 
  eu forbids us to do so . 
  they say it 's inhumane . 
   naval ( gb ) we have more aircraft carriers ( 2 vs 0 nowadays ) , better technology developed in collaboration with france ( destroyers and frigates ) and germany ( submarines ) , and we are in a strategic position in our sea . 
  they are no longer in the imperial era , kiddo . 
  define `` friction '' please . 
  the south is still poor and the north is still obliged to support it financially . 
  that chart starts in 1990 . http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:gdp_per_capita_big_four_western_europe.png, 
   linguistically , yes , it has been italian speaking for centuries . 
  no doubt about that . 
  secondly , can you define what an ` ethnic italian ' is ? 
  hint : it is going yo be very hard/impossible . 
  the same applies to the concept of `` ethnic germans '' or any other ethnicity . 
  as you said , language and culture are the key . 
  in trentino , people from the western part of the province speak eastern lombard ( hence they are ethnic italians like the people from brescia ) , while people from the eastern part speak venetian ( hence they are ethnic italians like the people from vicenza ) . 
  for sure they have nothing to do with germanic peoples , even if they were ruled for centuries by them . 
  in a few centuries , we could say the same about the south tyroleans , do n't you think ? 
   under the austrian crown their territory was united in the states of tyrol and italian speaking tyrol , normally referred to as ` trentino ' and they were considered tyroleans . 
  is this rightful to you ? 
  people from trentino have always been ethnically italians . 
  they are n't tyroleans . 
  also , ladins are a non-germanic latin population , like friulans from [ friuli ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friuli ) region . 
   separate from the eu i do n't think you can separate military and foreign policies from the rest . 
  i really hope so . 
  farage is our best bet in that direction . 
  when the european union will become a federation . 
  sooner or later they will have to accept anyway . 
   if ruk loses permanent seat on unsc we will take the french down with us .
