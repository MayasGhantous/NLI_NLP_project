  i do n't see it happening . 
  an european permanent seat is the solution . 
  south tyrol is exactly like the rest of austria . 
  it was annexed after ww1 because it 's an area of high strategic value since it includes the brenner pass . 
  in the past , south tyrolean people aspired to be a free state ( [ tyrol ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/county_of_tyrol ) ) or return under austrian rule , but today they have great autonomy ( no taxes to central government ) and they could not get better than this . 
  with austria or switzerland , they would not have the same benefits . 
  [ naples ] ( http://www.easyoops.com/img/architecturedesign/in_naples_metro_station_looks_like_a_museum_of_art/metro_station.jpg ) should be the paradise . 
   left party lol, 
   i like to compare a futuristic european union to the usa , where people are texan , california , east coast , detroit , etc. . but everybody is american before all ... 
  i prefer the comparison with switzerland , where german , french and italian peoples live peacefully since xviii century without having to abandon their traditions and cultures ... and they are all swiss . 
  you spelled / r/marenostrum wrong . 
  verona is full of them , trust me . 
  every teenager has one . 
  that 's the annual income . 
  i was talking about total wealth . 
  edit :  a danish is a piece of pastry . 
  sorry , in italian we use the same term for them . 
  they are common in every part of italy , from turin and milan to sicily . 
  if you live between the mountains of tyrol , you are the exception . 
  an italian is generally richer than a danish or any other european . 
  i 'm pretty sure the outside is the same . 
  see ? 
  only a terrone does n't know the difference between a lombard , a venetian and a ligurian . 
  what the fuck is a northener ? 
  you keep acting like a terrone . 
  god bless the russians . 
  these lambos look tough . 
  the interior is intact . 
   of course it 's a vengeance system . 
  when someone comes in my home and kills my mom i do n't want to rehabilitate him . 
  vengeance and mommy . 
  who are you , a sicilian ? 
  the european union , led by germany and its nordic circlejerk , forbids us to reject immigrants . 
  we have had for 20 years a right-wing government that would have gladly kicked back all the illegal immigrants . 
  there is no threat in this . 
  that is just the title of an english news . 
  in italy it 's a ** fact ** : if a tunisian wants to go in germany , we do n't keep him here . 
  why should we ? 
  it would be the right moment to leave this useless pro-america alliance . 
  absolutely irrelevant here . 
   except for the fact that nobody cares about sanremo either that 's not really true . 
  during that time the mass media do n't talk about anything else . 
  i think it 's the biggest televised event after the world cup . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's a gypsy from the balkan block . 
  italy has the original sanremo festival . 
  no one cares about eurovision festival here . 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  this is just the truth . 
  southern italy has the same level of spain and greece , or even worse . 
   all reports show [ you should read all sources . 
  [ not all europe is silent . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/grahamwp_uk/status/462325050528387073/photo/1 ) unfortunately . 
  so , what makes them slavic ? 
   no slavic country is european imo well , you have a really strange `` opinion '' . 
  culturally , historically , racially , ethnically , geographically , they are 100 % european . 
  edit : also , more importantly , both romania and moldova are n't slavic countries . 
   they have n't yet associated ~ ~ this ~ ~ their country fixed . 
   the possible entry of moldova proves that they do n't care if a country is european or not romania is european , but not moldova ? 
  un sammarinese su internet !!, 
  it does n't sound french at all . 
  no more than italian itself . 
  there is nothing like a `` genetic heir '' in history . 
  alexander and another macedonian of his time did n't necessarily have the exact same racial composition . 
  corsican is a dialect of italian . 
  we are mutually intelligible . 
  history is based on culture and traditions , not on genetics . 
  a greek and an italian may have the same blood , what makes them different ethnic groups is the culture . 
  well , usually it moves on the border of verisimilitude . 
  macedonia/fyrom is n't a slavic country ? 
  how can they consider themselves the heirs of a hellenic people ? 
  that 's what the op wants . 
  that 's the anglo mentality i do n't like . 
  france and italy have state-controlled energy corporations too . 
  you should read the thread from the start . 
  i think atlanticism is more deleterious for europe than a commercial relationship with russia . 
  he is part of the public opinion of his country . 
  that 's the opinion of the 51st state . 
   sign agreements to buy gas from exporters outside europe - like the united states this is what i do n't like . 
   it is italy . 
  [ ... ] that is where the beating heart of italy resides . 
  you basically know nothing of italian history and culture . 
  what do you mean with padania ? 
  the main tourist destinations are rome , florence , venice , pisa , verona , bologna etc. 
  most of the foreigners in naples are americans who are rediscovering their roots ... 
  well , the entire article is based on the assumption that '' * only 13 percent of tourists who come to italy go to southern italy * '' , and this data are confirmed by [ rai news ] ( http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/articoli/rapporto-italiadecide-bigdata-e-turismo-b78633fc-651a-4a51-9633-54d450cf356a.html ) . 
   they adapt , they learn italian , they integrate with the culture . 
  this is bullshit . 
  they dress like american rappers and eat kebab . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_italy you should look at the map in this page . 
  immigrants go where the work is , i.e. 
  in northern italy . 
   il fatto is n't a good news source not enough demochristian ? 
  it would be interesting to read a list of the absolute values . 
  some commentators call him `` berluschino '' with reasons . 
  these reasons are too many and my english is rough . 
  an example ? 
  he said that he would never become premier without going through the elections . 
  long story short , he is called `` berluschino '' ( little berlusconi ) by some commentators . 
  he was not referring to `` more countries '' . 
  italian politicians rarely talk about foreign policies .
