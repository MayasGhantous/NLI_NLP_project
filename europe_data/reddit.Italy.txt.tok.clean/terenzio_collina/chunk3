  bicycling is one of the major differences between north and south . 
  you should learn the difference between nation and state . 
  actually he was from arezzo . 
  but , anyway , florentines are n't italians ? 
   it 's a great piece of art from a time where everything was miserable . 
  are you on drugs ? 
  the david is not a national monument for italy . 
  we do n't really care about it . 
  romania is not exactly the same as ukraine . 
  a difference of 400-600 km means double the range of missile systems . 
  it 's very simple . 
  they do n't want nato defence systems near their frontiers . 
  he might be even the mafia boss himself . 
  why not ? 
   berlusconi was the son of a mafia contact that 's a big speculation . 
  you need a tinfoil hat for this post . 
  are you referring to imu ? 
  that tax is designed specifically to attack the second/holiday houses of the middle class . 
  the house is considered a fundamental right in the italian society . 
  what about the rest of europe ? 
  i do n't think moldavia has a dubbing industry like big countries . 
  i do n't understand why a belgian should be better in english than a moldovan . 
  i was just kidding m8 . 
  they are the 51st state . 
  today germany does n't have the military strength to handle situations in bosnia or sub-saharian africa ? 
  even italy would be prepared for this . 
  those are the financial times proposals , not the renzi 's agenda . 
  is this supposed to be a good thing ? 
  you know , the world does n't revolve around scandinavia . 
   well its still south of us just like poland and baltic countries are still north of us . 
  exactly what i was saying . 
  the axis to be taken into consideration is the west-east . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union it 's not really a `` north vs south '' thing . 
  italy is the third net contributor , while lithuania , estonia and poland are among the biggest recipients . 
  for what they are dying then ? 
  break away from russian sphere of influence ? 
  `` fighting for a better ukraine '' is really a vague concept . 
  can you make some examples , or not ? 
   full of people put there by berlusconi some examples ? 
   conservative and pro-vatican network like rai what ?!, 
  it 's just the public broadcaster owned by the italian state . 
   your governments gave the nsa the information after a polite request . 
  that 's the point . 
  you should think of yourself . 
  it 's just the truth . 
  nope , but you can talk about italian politics with arrogance . 
  a dude of that country . 
  i do n't accept lessons from a country that is worse off than mine . 
  i do n't think spain is going any better , even without berlusconi . 
  at least we italians are not leeches of the eu . 
   all of my italian friends call them center-right because the party is full of former [ christian-democrats ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_democracy_%28italy%29 ) . 
  in italy , only commies are considered `` true left '' . 
  nope . 
  italy is a full parliamentary republic and we vote only for the parliament . 
  ( this is why our governments do n't have many powers . ), 
  why do you care ? 
  sincere question . 
   but you 've not been living there for 6 years !, 
  he/she is still a swiss citizen . 
   gallic attitudes more like latin attitudes . 
   carino this does n't sound like `` nice '' in english . 
  starbucks in italy ? 
  we drink real coffee . 
   look at norway . 
  what ? 
  they will ask for asylum , claiming to flee from war and famine , and we are obliged to accept . 
  such is life in the eu . 
  [ italian coins ] ( http://0.tqn.com/d/coins/1/0/1/2/-/-/italy_money_coins.jpg ) .

  i went through austria to go to germany and czechia . 
  personally , i prefer the [ italian alps ] ( http://treviso24.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/dolomiti.jpg ) . 
  i see no insults here , man . 
  take it easy . 
   i 've never been on holiday in austria , it 's a country that does not like me . 
  actually , we admire the german people , the workers and the companies . 
  politicians are always viewed with suspicion in italy . 
   in france we find italy to be a mess . 
  i think it 's a picture shared by all latin countries , including france . 
  like a powerful version of italy . 
  italians are very aware that they have always ** given to ** the eu . 
  i do n't like austria neither before nor after the vacation . 
  but you have good infrastructures !, 
  italy has never taken money from the eu ; on the contrary we are among the states that give more .
