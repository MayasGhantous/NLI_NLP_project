  we are notoriously self-haters . 
  in italy , the germans are always taken as a model in public debate . 
  why do spaniards see italy as the least trustworthy ? 
  i thought we were friends . 
  i 'm sorry to disappoint your racism , but ...  the pirelli calendar is a trade calendar published by the pirelli company 's uk subsidiary . 
  oh , the british media !, 
  i 've never been to sardinia . 
  the maggot cheese is banned by the european union in the same way of the cinnamon products . 
  i made a parallel between the two situation . 
  do you understand now ? 
  me ... what ? 
  you are talking about the ban on cassia . 
  i 'm talking about the ban on maggot cheese . 
  maggot cheese is one of the traditional foods subject to the ban of the european union . 
  in sardinia they still produce maggot cheese , so the eu ban is not really effective . 
  this is ** very ** accurate , better than a professional article . 
   gdp per capita in the uk is already higher than in germany source ? 
  the situation in last fiscal year was [ germany 41,866 $ and united kingdom 39,161 $ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita ) . 
  i suppose this has to do with the increase in population , both domestic and immigration . 
  germany and italy are stagnant from this point of view , dunno about france . 
   anyway , veneto is in the padana valley . 
  nope . 
  [ po valley ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/po_bacino_idrografico.png ) and venetian-friulan plain are two different things . 
   and most maps i 've seen make this padania . 
  that is northern italy , not padania as intended by its inventors . 
  italy has some historical basis : [ roman era ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_italy ) , [ medieval era ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_italy_%28holy_roman_empire%29 ) , [ modern era ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_italy_%28napoleonic%29 ) . 
  padania is a concept invented in the '90s and , [ according to lega nord ] ( http://www.leganord.org/index.php/il-movimento/lo-statuto-della-lega-nord ) , it includes toscana , marche and umbria . 
  if it were a synonym of the po valley , it should also exclude veneto and liguria . 
  padania is an invention , and as such fits the circumstances . 
  puritanism is n't a catholic thing . 
  just look at berlusconi ; we do n't care about his sexual adventures contrary to anglo media . 
  italy does not have the diplomatic power of france . 
  we did not even have a seat on the un security council . 
  when france , supported by the british , decided to overthrow gaddafi , we had already lost our spot . 
  article 11 of the constitution of italy says :  italy rejects war as an instrument of aggression against the freedom of other peoples and as a means for the settlement of international disputes . 
  also , italy was the first commercial partner of lybia ; we had no reason to change the status quo . 
  now that role is occupied by the french . 
  so the parliament , sovereign according to the constitution , has not approved anything . 
   not really . 
  this is your opinion . 
  reality is another thing . 
  the parties always receive contributions from any source . 
  when ? 
  this happens in every case , regardless of public funding . 
  the parliament is sovereign . 
  international treaties are a matter for diplomats . 
  then the term to use would be `` unconstitutional '' . 
  how can a law be illegal ? 
  you 're replying to a pseudo-racist comment . 
  he does n't care about stats , as long as they do n't allow him the joke . 
  immigrants in italy have access to birth control . 
  still , they have a higher birth rate than italians . 
  probably the same situation applies to other european countries . 
  read the whole sentence and the context in which it is inserted . 
  '' [ to fund a political party ] , now you have to donate yourself '' . 
  this is exactly what i said . 
  i 'm not sure i understand your comment . 
   just give each party tax money according to the number of votes they received . 
  this was the old method . 
  no more state funding for political parties , now you have to donate yourself . 
  i do n't think economy and birth rate are related factors , at least not in the same direction . 
  this . 
  exactly like russia is the successor state of the soviet union . 
  actually , the sicilian mafia was almost eradicated in the 1990s . 
  nowadays it 's not more powerful than any gang in los angeles or any other american city . 
  in contrast , the ndrangheta from calabria is still very strong and international , and so is the camorra in naples . 
  the usual mafioso has not even finished the compulsory education . 
  for those who do n't understand the importance of the news : renzi will be the next italian prime minister . 
  why is this less relevant than `` germany 's young spd social democrats reject merkel coalition '' ? 
  i like how foreigners think it 's just about fun . 
   france is in deseperate need of reforms , but plagued with a lot of immobilism and corporatism interests . 
  it sounds familiar . 
  who is the enemy , usa or russia ? 
  not sure about the ending date . 
  [ since the 80 's , italy was * de facto * governed by the socialists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pentapartito ) . 
  the italian justice system is considered a joke around the world , since the time of the mitterrand doctrine . 
  i prefer the google method . 
  if an employer wants to hire only his friends , instead of capable people , that 's his problem . 
  i do n't think ferrari , armani or ferrero hire only recommended workers . 
  if this is the way to judge a person , i am not surprised that italy has all these problems . 
  that article , unlike the previous one , is totally lacking sources . 
  besides , i would like to know a bank that does not host the money of some criminals . 
  google translate of italian wikipedia :  after the first youth work experiences as a singer and entertainer on cruise ships together with his friend fedele confalonieri and as door to door salesman of electric brooms , he began the business as real estate agent and , in 1961 , founded the cantieri riuniti milanesi together the manufacturer pietro canali . 
  the first business was a real estate purchase land in alciati street in milan , for 190 million ( lira ) , thanks to the surety of the banker carlo rasini ( owner and co-founder of the rasini bank , where berlusconi 's father worked ) . 
  i know , it 's more fun to imagine him as a mobster . 
  no , i do n't think a person who publicly offends gays ( or anyone else ) is a corrupt leader . 
  probably we use different dictionaries , mr. sheepman . 
   great job picking out a single point actually i was also very interested to understand what you meant with `` extortion '' , but it is clear that you are speaking without knowing the situation , so i have not insisted . 
  a [ 17yo woman ] ( http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110124060010/nonciclopedia/images/c/c3/ruby_rubacuori_palpata_di_culo.jpg ) is considered a child in germany ? 
  here in italy the age of consent is set at 14 yo . 
  regarding the rest of your `` impartial '' and `` dispassionate '' comment , i suggest you to inform you about the italian justice system and the separation of powers . 
  you 'll find that berlusconi , despite its flaws , is persecuted by the judiciary for some other reason . 
  you can also use a few more words to express your thoughts . 
  do you think berlusconi is a mafia boss ? 
  why exactly do you think italy is a `` corrupt country '' ? 
  i live there , exactly in rome , and i have never encountered any problems . 
  berlusconi is not the evil incarnate , as some like to describe him . 
  he is just a shrewd and cynical businessman . 
  no doubt he has never been corrupted by anyone but himself . 
  it 's just a list of the `` proudest '' countries , or the least self-loathing .
