  the last time before 1861 we shared a culture , it was the roman era . 
  i 'm ashamed to be associated to the neapolitans , with whom i share nothing of my history . 
  we are the founders and third-largest net contributors of the eu . 
   and more specific the nations that can actually produce food like spain italy portugal and the rest of the south france included .

  touch\u00e9 is used in italy too .
