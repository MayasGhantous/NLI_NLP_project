  no one really cares about the thought of that renegade jew around here . 
   christianity no , thank you . 
   italy is part of the big 4/5 financial contributors to the eurovision are you sure about this ? 
  because the eurovision song contest is not much popular here . 
  the italian one since you voted for him . 
  who was the singer ? 
  it was just a way to say that turkey encompasses both . 
  they were turkic . 
  islamic and/or turkic are the constant , apparently . 
  the ottoman empire conquered and administered parts of europe , but it has nothing to do with the european peoples and their culture . 
  it was probably the first real threat to europe . 
  you are not european , my friend . 
  what happened to sicily ? 
  i do n't know where this goldsmiths university is located , but i really hope not in europe . 
   to avoid brexit [ ... ] first of all he should explain why it would be bad . 
  the muslim woman is not a menace to society , so i 'd say `` hello '' . 
  the swedes will no longer exist in the long run . 
  why do they need israel as an ally ? 
   i take it strong regionalism has something to do with this not at all . 
  mexico is only big . 
  italy is an advanced economy . 
  you need to find and identify them , to give them medical assistance , feeding them , etc. 
  moreover , many of them do n't have documents , so no foreign state accepts their repatriation . 
  what northern europeans fail to realize is that the problem is not asylum seekers , but illegal unregistered immigration . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_most_beautiful_villages_in_italy this is my favourite : [ corciano ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nytv-7jrerq ) . 
  i 'm just asking for a source for this statement :  even worse , they looted the graves and played games with skulls and bones they found . 
  author , book title and page . 
   so that detail about the games played with bones was stated explicitly in the 1816 text . 
  this is the topic of our argument . 
  what page ? 
  it says nothing about bones and skulls . 
  [ what page ? 
   document dealing with the costs of renovating the church what about the napoleonic troops playing football with the skulls ? 
  can you provide the exact source of those letters and diaries ? 
   religious devotion : crocifissa ( crucified ) , addolorata ( in pain , as in `` sharing the the pain of christ '' ) , assunta ( ascended , not as in pcmr but as in `` ascended to heaven '' ) . 
  these have fast faded from use and now are mostly found among old ladies and unlucky middle aged ones . 
  for the record , those are/were used only in southern italy . 
  it 's one of the ways that you can recognize the origin of an italian . 
  best : mario ( from the roman general , not the videogame character ) . 
  worst : ermenegildo ( from the visigothic king ) . 
   being a small city in the center/south of the country fyi macerata is not in southern italy . 
  that 's sad , but who cares ? 
  switzerland is for the swiss . 
  [ brothers of italy ( r ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brothers_of_italy ),

  yes .

  what italian groups were in frankfurt ? 
  des-troika and black block are mostly germans . 
  your country is the heart of the anarchist/antifa movement . 
  * gypsy mentality intensifies *, 
  des-troika is a german-based anarchist group . 
  it 's top news in italy . 
  [ most of them were germans .

  i do n't know what a political sex scandal has to do with strikes . 
   no italy what ?!, 
  we are probably at the french level . 
  the italian armed forces have an entire division dedicated to pharmacy and chemistry . 
  * http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/stabilimento_chimico_farmaceutico_militare * http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/corpo_sanitario_dell'esercito_italiano, 
  you can add italy to that list . 
  since the post-war era the italian intelligence is an american puppet . 
  the abu omar case or the niger uranium forgeries are just recent examples , but we ca n't forget the whole `` strategy of tension '' period . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  if flying a foreign flag may cause trouble , it seems right to remove it . 
  there is no law to guarantee this right to foreigners . 
  fyi  italy has a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size , but there is a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises , many of them grouped in clusters , which are the backbone of the italian industry . 
  someone has to pay the workers . 
  much of our ( enormous ) debt is held by domestic entities . 
   `` you '' ( italian banks , i mean . 
  i am quite sure you are not a bank ceo ) italian banks \u2192 italian companies \u2192 italian workers \u2192 italian families . 
  you know , the so-called `` economy '' . 
   tsipras and outspoken finance minister yanis varoufakis tried at first to mount a coalition against berlin , touring france , italy , britain , brussels and media studios after their election . 
  they found no allies outside the media . 
  apparently , he did n't know that greece is in debt with the italian financial system of about 40 billion ( after germany with 60 and france with 46 ) . 
  we need that money . 
   most of the elders wo n't build a bathroom because of building cost and water cost . 
  maybe the next 2-3 generations will change things around . 
  i do n't want to sound too socialist , but it would therefore be good if the state force them to do so . 
  you know , for health and hygiene issues . 
   turkish-austrian friendship 11 september 1683 . 
  never forget . 
  i do n't understand what 's your point . 
  is this what they teach in british schools ? 
  after malta and suez , we must drive out the brits from gibraltar and cyprus . 
  go fuck yourself in your north sea . 
   but i guess this all depends on whatever government is in charge at the moment . 
  in italy it 's bipartisan .

  i always thought that france is the most pro-palestine country in europe , along with italy .
