  we need a casus belli m8 . 
  you 're not doing a good service to the nation . 
  in many places you do n't even receive citizenship with only 10 years . 
  if you are 10 years old , yes . 
   the british were the first people to properly colonise the island . 
  those people were not even self-sufficient until recently . 
  they were persuaded and forced to stay there for political reasons . 
  so yes , the british crown has the legal right to maintain sovereignty ( just like in some parts of antarctica ) , but let 's not pretend that it 's a colony like the usa or canada . 
  an independence referendum there is ridiculous . 
  so let me get this straight , the british crown has funded a small colony of british settlers some years ago and this should ensure the democratic rights on the islands . 
  to be clear , i 'm not saying that las malvinas son argentinas , but rather that it 's stupid to ask the islanders to resolve the issue . 
   descendants since when ? 
  19th or 20th century ? 
   islanders they are 3000 british colonists m8 . 
  [ hello . 
  ] ( http://ximene.net/wp-content/gallery/rise-of-nations/free-occitan.jpg ), 
   very very few people actually speak regional languages in france who knows why !, 
  italy has good relations with iran . 
  so trusted that they deposed the last emperor of the western roman empire , romulus augustulus . 
   hardly a barbarian invasion if you are already there to welcome them . 
  the goths were refugees during the era of attila . 
  rome welcomed them under its protection ( in exchange for service in the legions ) . 
  we know how that turned out . 
  the carabinieri are considered among the most professional in the world regarding peace-keeping and patrolling . 
  they are n't kids like most of the regular armies . 
  the french were less prepared than italians and they had to invent a lie to justify their failure . 
  moreover , it would be quite normal to dialogue with local tribal leaders . 
   iraqi insurgents rarely attacked italians around nasiriyah http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_nasiriyah_bombing, 
   he was taken hostage together with umberto cupertino , maurizio agliana and salvatore stefio . 
  they worked in iraq as security contractors . 
  quattrocchi 's kidnappers forced him to dig his own grave and kneel beside it wearing a hood as they prepared to film his death , but he defied them by pulling off the hood and shouting `` vi faccio vedere come muore un italiano ! '', 
  - `` i 'll show you how an italian dies ! '' . 
  he was then shot in the back of the neck . 
  he had the balls . 
  berlusconi junior : the revenge . 
  no wonder it 's an englishman to say this . 
  why the fuck did you join us in 1973 ? 
  i 'm totally with my northern neighbor here . 
   the police chief ( and former mayor ) of roman province , walter veltroni , was found the be taking 5,000 euro bribes from the mafia source ? 
  veltroni was the major of rome . 
   the east `` roman '' empire yep . 
  maybe you should start giving trust to the judiciary in the same way you give it to the politicians . 
  separation of powers is a pillar of the modern state . 
  that was the greek/byzantine 's sphere of influence . 
  there was nothing roman in palestine . 
  anti-corruption is a code word for `` i want to bring down that government that i do n't like '' . 
  those traditions are from the middle east . 
  in italy you sound more competent if you speak a dead language than one that is taught since kindergarten . 
  here the us are associated with cigarettes ( marlboro , camel , lucky strike , philip morris etc ) . 
   i 've always found it interesting how an explicitly criminal organisation played a notable role acting as a form of italian resistance . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_mafia#fascist_suppression ) : * in 1925 , benito mussolini initiated a campaign to destroy the mafia and assert fascist control over sicilian life . 
  the mafia threatened and undermined his power in sicily , and a successful campaign would strengthen him as the new leader , legitimizing and empowering his rule . 
  [ ... ] when mussolini firmly established his power in january 1925 , he appointed cesare mori as the prefect of palermo in october 1925 and granted him special powers to fight the mafia . 
  mori formed a small army of policemen , carabinieri and militiamen , which went from town to town , rounding up suspects . 
  to force suspects to surrender , they would take their families hostage , sell off their property , or publicly slaughter their livestock . 
  [ ... ] mori 's campaign ended in june 1929 when mussolini recalled him to rome . 
  although he did not permanently crush the mafia as the fascist press proclaimed , his campaign was nonetheless very successful at suppressing it . 
  as the mafia informant antonino calderone reminisced : `` the music changed . 
  mafiosi had a hard life . 
  after the war the mafia hardly existed anymore . 
  the sicilian families had all been broken up . 
  moreover , some scholars discusses the relation between mafia organizations and the post-unification resistance movement . 
  see [ brigandage in southern italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brigandage_in_southern_italy ) . 
  traditional organized crime provides some sort of welfare care to their affiliates , therefore they get all the support they need from a consistent part of the population ( e.g. 
  when the carabinieri arrest a boss , there are often small riots in some neighborhoods ) . 
  they are n't just criminals , it 's a cultural phenomenon in southern italy . 
  the sicilian mafia was absolutely the most powerful in italy , but it was mostly defeated in 1990s when they started doing [ terrorist attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_of_via_dei_georgofili ) in the rest of the country . 
  before that , mafia was tolerated because it was useful as an anti-communist and had the support of the americans ( since the allied-invasion of sicily ) . 
   they do n't want to leave the eu , but to change its policies . 
  same about grillo 's m5s !, 
   would n't m5s ' definition of establishment include labor unions ? 
  labor unions in italy are a complicated matter . 
  the three largest of them are hated even among leftists because they are nothing more than the lobbies of bureaucrats and public employees , a privileged class as much as the traditional `` bad guys '' . 
  on the contrary , the well-known labor union [ fiom ] ( http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/federazione_impiegati_operai_metallurgici ) , representing metalworkers , is supported by the m5s . 
  i agree with you , podemos seems more serious and organized than the party of grillo . 
  theoretically , however , they are the same thing : anti-establishment , environmentalism , euroscepticism , direct democracy , nonviolence , anti-capitalism , anti-americanism , right to internet access , etc. 
  grillo is just populist . 
  he has no real political program . 
  [ his party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_star_movement ) resembles podemos . 
  it sounds like renzi 's democratic party of italy . 
  france is way bigger than netherlands and denmark . 
  the uk is not crucial for the eu - they never really integrated . 
  gallic nation ... franco-german axis ... those are not the words of an italian , but the british press . 
  mario monti has said only that populism in france could be a problem for the eu . 
  since 1300s that city was inhabited by germanic people . 
  for example , johannes von baysen ( or jan ba\u017cy\u0144ski as you renamed him ) was german . 
  even milan was founded by the celts ( or some ancient people before them ) , but i 'd say that is an italian city that owes its cultural development exclusively to the italian people . 
  well , hitler was right about danzig . 
  his criminal record is stained with far more serious crimes . 
  or the good ol' mitteleuropa under the habsburgs , my austrian friend . 
   the u.s. army says it will soon be sending armored stryker vehicles on a 1,100-mile convoy through six european countries to show solidarity to allies well , if it 's for solidarity ... 
  these are permanent : * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/columbus_ ( iss_module ) * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tranquility_ ( iss_module ) * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harmony_ ( iss_module ) * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cupola_ ( iss_module ) * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leonardo_ ( iss_module ), 
  do you know that half of the international space station was built in turin ? 
  just like the italian [ alenia aermacchi sky-x ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alenia_aermacchi_sky-x ) . 
  it 's funny when the protestants are competing to see who is the most ruralist and practical . 
  you forgot sardinia and sicily in the last picture . 
  you have a strange concept of supporters . 
   if pd gets 50 % in the polls that are conducted on everybody it indicates that 25 milion italians have the intention to vote pd , then there are election , let 's say there is a 50 % turnout pd is going to get only 12.5 milion real votes . 
  this is exactly what i 'm saying to you . 
  if berlusconi has 10 % in the polls does n't mean he has the support of 5 million people .
