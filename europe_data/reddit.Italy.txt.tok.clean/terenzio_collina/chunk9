  it happened in western europe too . 
  the arab spring was fueled by the us and its gulf allies .

  the unrightful demand was poland .

  the armed junta in donbass are just ethnic russians in ukraine who do n't support the us-backed coup . 
  look at the sources . 
  do you really believe that a peaceful demonstration has naturally turned into a civil war ? 
  what makes you think i want to live in russia ? 
  i just want peace between the peoples of europe ( including russia ) . 
  russia is a sort of empire with russians as the leading nation . 
  you americans do n't even have your own language . 
  you should learn the difference between nation and state . 
  i used the term `` regular '' in the sense of `` normalized '' . 
  unlike italy or germany , us and uk are n't neutral towards russia . 
  i support national reunification , a concept that an american ca n't understand since you are not a real nation . 
  not a single bullet was fired in crimea . 
   the syrian civil war began in isolation of western interference . 
  you are so naive : fsa is an american proxy , while army of conquest is a saudi one . 
  us and uk do n't have good diplomatic relations with russia ; italy , germany and france have . 
  we are talking about us vs russia , thus syria and ukraine . 
   can you trust russia and will russia trust the west ? 
  most of europe has regular diplomatic relations with russia . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the only belligerent country is the us with its proxy wars . 
  i think it 's time to dismantle nato . 
  sounds like south america . 
  in italy it 's a kind of cosplay event with parade wagons and traditional sweets . 
  the free market : romanian edition . 
  danish by ethnicity or documents ? 
   palestinians mistaken as knifemen are killed by mistake how many of these incidents are we talking about here ? 
  have you said martin schulz ? 
  welcome in the club !, 
   it is clear that catholicism is not compatible with europe . 
  / s just like any other semitic religion . 
  in italian language , the noun is * guerra * ( from frankish ) , but the adjective is * bellico * ( from latin ) . 
  til udinese is considered a major italian team . 
  til iaquinta is popular outside of italy . 
  it 's calabrian dialect of the neapolitan language . 
  sicilian-american mafia and sicilian mafia ( cosa nostra ) are almost disappeared . 
  ndrangheta is completely another thing and it 's from calabria . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/denmark/comments/3sneuz/ciao_a_tutti_cultural_exchange_with_ritaly/cwzw8wx ) . 
  it 's an old thread for a cultural exchange between r/denmark and r/italy where we speak about mafia . 
  actually , mafia is an umbrella term in italy too , even if it 's a sicilian slang . 
  the criminal organization in sicily is called cosa nostra . 
  he 's replying to this :  so yes , the original titles will be changed as well . 
  with this :  they are not doing away with them , the previous titles will still be accessible, 
   do n't worry , you can still access your material by using the old keywords . 
  i want the original name on the plate , i do n't care if it 's in a database accessible to professionals . 
  i sincerely hope that the rijksmuseum will be boycotted by italian museums regarding exchanges of art pieces . 
  germany 's journalists waged a violent campaign against far right since 1945 . 
  she supported the us decision however , while at the same time her project with russia is untouched . 
   right ... because i mean , it 's not like people was n't already revolting before you are very naive if you think that the arab springs across mena were spontaneous . 
  russia cancelled it because the project was freezed by bulgaria pressured by the eu acting on behalf of the us . 
  technically correct , but :  putin accused the eu of denying bulgaria , heavily dependent on russian gas , its sovereign rights , and said that blocking the project `` is against europe 's economic interests and is causing damage '' . 
  [ ... ] indeed , the commission has put pressure on bulgaria to freeze south stream , citing breaches to eu law in the intergovernmental agreement for the construction of the pipeline . 
   i 'll just go ahead and post the answer to the unavoidably `` germany sabotaged south stream so they can build north stream '' posting they are two different projects perfectly compatible with each other . 
  south stream was blocked by bulgaria due to us pressure . 
  turkey 's project was chosen as alternative . 
   it 's really funny the most anti-immigration party in italy is also one of the closest friend of the president of the country that [ vetoed ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39pknm/spiegel_russian_veto_threatens_eu_mission_against/ ) the un resolution about stopping smugglers . 
  russia now supports italy 's stance on libya . 
  italians also remember that such chaos was caused by the american and french intervention in a strategic country for their national interests . 
  what about the pro-american lobby ? 
  in italy it 's active since the end of the world war 2 . 
   it 's not about forbidding , he basically says that emancipation and equal rights movements lead to pointless stuff like female weightlifters and he goes on to explain that women 's hips and men 's shoulders are wider for a reason . 
  he also says that men and women are equally important but have different roles , as described in genesis . 
  his argument seemed so reasonable , i do n't get why he had to mention the bible . 
   source : half my family is corsican . 
  a mixed family is the less unbiased on the matter . 
  we italians do n't put random italian words in an english sentence . 
  where are you from ? 
  english translation of `` battuta '' is joke . 
  there are more people in milan than the whole of norway . 
  there 's two practical ways we can go : we may invest economically and educationally in youth , motherhood and family , or african immigration . 
  [ i think we need to debate them . 
  ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/world/europe/italy-delays-eus-renewal-of-sanctions-against-russia.html ), 
   italy and the uk have two very different views of europe . 
  while the uk holds the single market as its main focus , italy 's position is inspired by the vision of a federal eu and ever-closer integration , both economically and politically . 
  they are in the union only for the benefits and to thwart the plans . 
  i see no reason to cooperate with the 51st state . 
  crimea is russian , deal with it . 
  this subreddit is full of americans . 
  at best it was leaving the turkish air space . 
  if the jet crashed into syrian territory , it seems hard to believe that it has invaded the turkish air space ignoring numerous warnings of the turkish air force . 
  the current italian government is basically a puppet government . 
  foreign policy is a taboo in the public political debate . 
  if you are against nato , every single news media and mainstream party ( sometimes the judiciary ) will be against you . 
  even a billionaire like berlusconi has paid dearly for his friendships with putin and gaddafi . 
  iraq is in the middle of a civil war . 
  in italy there would definitely be a coup or a balkanization . 
  the last three times an anti-american party came close to power : a [ prime minister was killed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kidnapping_of_aldo_moro ) , a [ coup was close to realization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golpe_borghese ) , and a [ corruption scandal engulfed the whole political class ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mani_pulite ) . 
  also , you should read about the so-called years of lead and the strategy of tension . 
  we do n't have a permanent seat in the security council at the un , not even a nuclear arsenal . 
  we do n't need uncle sam if a terrorist attack happens on italian soil . 
  we have a lot of european allies , [ including russia ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/vladimir-putin-russia-trip-rome-italy ) . 
  what did nato done good for italians ? 
  it 's an alliance whose purpose is to secure american interests . 
  the us has over 100 military installations , 7 major bases and 12,000 troops in my country since the end of ww2 .
