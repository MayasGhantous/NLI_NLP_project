gib back clay, 
  i 'm not you 're guy , human . 
  1066 never forget !, 
  but communist rule was no better . 
  killing the tsar is one thing , but killing his wife , all his children , the servants and all the others is just fucked up . 
  the bolsheviks were psychos . 
  they should have done the trial thing like england did with charles i. 
  poland into space , poland into mars !!!, 
  not of belongings into lowly yurop, 
  make antarctica great again !, 
   roman empire ~ ~ best empire ! ~ ~ * only * italian empire #ftfy, 
  jesus did n't do it , his followers did more than a thousand years after . 
  meanwhile mohammed and co. conquered mecca , the holy city for pre-islam religions and then led an army through arabia , the near east , persia and north africa, 
  i also recall the part where jesus led 10,000 men to conquer someone else 's holy city . 
   well it 's lucky we do n't really just use tectonic plates to decide where a continent starts and stops . 
  [ yup ] ( https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6034/6303199024_7aceb75b87.jpg ), 
  secular just means separation of religion and state . 
  how many people died under capitalism ? 
  indian famines + irish famine + colonial genocides + great depression + other poverty + other starvations etc. 
  the indian famines alone are ~ 40 million deaths . 
  add up the other ones and capitalism deaths surpass `` communism '' deaths ( communism has n't really been implemented and probably never will ) . 
  half the words you 're using are `` euroshit '' . 
  lindt 's lindor from switzerland . 
  alternatively , everything ferrero ( from italy ) . 
  the anschluss is real . 
  [ also belarus and russia fully integrate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_state ), 
   ~ ~ eu4 ~ ~ map colouring simulator 2013 is leaking, 
  [ here 's my attempt ] ( http://imgur.com/a/bmlyn ), 
  no gib monies plox, 
  wrong . 
  lent comes from old english * len ( c ) ten * , meaning spring ( cognate to dutch * lente * , which still means spring ) . 
  easter comes from * \u0112ostre * , a germanic goddess . 
  the shitposts are evolving, 
  not yet, 
  brandenburg was never part of the second polish republic . 
  ottoman cannons ca n't melt theodosian walls ... 1453 was an inside job, 
  at this rate constantinople turns greek again . 
  [ i prefer this version tbh . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71pojwxibkw ), 
  lots of indo-european/languages posts lately . 
  til the appenines have glaciers, 
  / r/latestagecapitalism, 
   in total , there are 32 elements named after specific places on earth . 
  24 are named after places in europe . 
   poland , czech republic , slovakia , austria and hungary austria-hungary has risen again, 
  i 'll take ceylon . 
  remove kebab from premises pls, 
   like italy surrounded the papal states . 
  italy actually first annexed the papal states then released a tiny portion almost 60 years later . 
  us annexation confirmed ? 
  operation tannenbaum , he did plan to annex the swiss too . 
   controlling everything east of paris and west of tokyo . 
  [ this was hitler 's actual plan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/generalplan_ost_staatenkarte2.jpg ), 
  in italian it 's `` calcio '' ( `` kick '' ) but it still makes sense . 
  at least it will shield the uk from all those weather fronts ... wait ohhh . 
  gives a whole new meaning to dr. \u00d6sterreich . 
  holy fuck , gaddhaffi was right all along while the arabs were laughing at him . 
  / r/latestagecapitalism, 
  the russian accent makes this somehow more magnificent . 
   charles is next in line pls no, 
  needs moar jpeg, 
  winter war never forget, 
  [ the great christmas culinary war ] ( http://biancatrading.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/pandoro-vs-panettone.jpg ), 
  it was for self-defence . 
  the guy shot the police . 
  guess you never been to glorious / r/yurop, 
  and the aqueducts, 
  so stronk . 
  that would be k\u00f6nigsberg . 
  we 're not really that racists . 
  we just hate and joke about everyone , each other and ourselves . 
  [ especially ourselves .

  aftermath of the great italian christmas culinary wars, 
  d\u00f6nerepublik n\u00f6rdturkey, 
  / r/accidentalrenaissance, 
  do n't forget the franks . 
  it 's anschluss time, 
  a theory explains how something works , it does not talk about the existence or factuality of things . 
  gravity , germs and atoms are theories too . 
  not the first time . 
  many dialects are going to follow old people into their graves . 
  walser , friulian , sardinian , slovene and maybe ladin may disappear too . 
  and it 's not just italy , france is losing occitan and breton and scotland and ireland might lose scottish and irish gaelic . 
  cornish and manx are practically dead by this point . 
  there are probably many other similar cases throughout europe . 
  ~ ~ europe ~ ~ switzerland stronk !, 
  typical latvian [ breakfast ] ( http://perfectresonance.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/potatoes-no.jpg ) typical latvian [ lunch ] ( http://www.meandmydiabetes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/no-potato.jpg ) typical latvian [ dinner ] ( https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.70569082.9690/flat,800x800,075,t.u4.jpg ), 
   is no potato . 
  is only hallucination from ** malnourish ** . 
  # ftfy, 
  von hindenburg was forced to appoint hitler as chancellor . 
  * democratic * people 's republic of korea, 
  my merch sells like god-church, 
  hitler was n't democratically elected . 
  again , the entire slavic race would have been wiped off the planet if nazism prevailed . 
  communism had more time . 
  imagine what would have happened if germany won wwii . 
  slavs : close to extinction for example .
