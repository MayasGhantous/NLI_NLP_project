this is a safety issue , not religious . 
  you 've clearly never been to jail . 
  ** as much as i despise berlusconi ( and trust me , i do ) , compared to trump he 's fucking abe lincoln . 
  berlusconi never threatened to jail his opponent , or not to accept the results of a free election ; he never bragged about assaulting women ; he did n't base a campaign over blatant racism ; he is 10 times as smart and 100 times as charismatic as trump . 
  there is a clear reason why berlusconi was elected three times : the guy is a freaking genius , from a political , entrepreneurial and communicational point of view . 
  let 's not fool ourselves and pretend that trump 's election was in any way deserved . 
  this may be patriotism speaking , but in italy the consensus is that british schools are basically a joke . 
  i 've had friends that , coming back from a year in england as exchange students , had to basically re-do a year worth of classes since the way topics were addressed there ( math , literature , history , philosophy ) was not nearly enough to pass the year here ; i had a british girl who was studying to work in the ** tourism ** sector that looked at me in utter suprise when i told her i was from milan ( `` i thought you were italian !, 
  '' ) ; my very english and english-educated classmates at uni have been among those who 've struggled the most even with relatively easy levels of math ( algebra and differential calculus , namely ) . 
   how raw it felt . 
  i really like the way you put it , and i think i get what you mean ? 
  care to expand ? 
  tbh milan is the kind of city that you need to * get * : if you do you 'll love it forever ; if you do n't ... you just wo n't . 
  milan is really much , much better than how you 're depicting it , although the stale piss part was kinda funny . 
  as a milanese , i 'm moderately offended ; as a lombard , i 'm flattered , 
  you 're right , suing some random scientists over a french cartoon was probably not a great idea . 
  lol no you 're not . 
  i know that , and i 'm not implying that they delayed the procedures on purpose . 
  i 'm just explaining why we did n't deport him . 
  we tried to deport him but the tunisians messed up with some procedures . 
  we ca n't deport a guy if his country does n't want him back . 
  italy and italians are stronger than you think . 
  we 're a resourceful people , we 'll be fine . 
  that 's not the kind of speech of someone who 's planning to stay away for long . 
  still beautiful though . 
  renzi 's speech was actually quite beautiful . 
  someone should translate it ( not me , way too lazy ), 
  it 's more about the political consequences of this ref : if no wins , renzi resigns and eurosceptics will have a pretty good time . 
   renzi  center-left  pick one  * yawn * pick four, 
   no , since 9th vote , 50 % +1 votes decide the pdr . 
  which will make sure that the opposition forces find a reasonable compromise in the first 8 ( eight ) votings . 
   the powers given to the national government over the regional ones will mean many abuses . 
  such as ? 
   the fear is that given the vote nobody will be able to touch the new text , and many political scientists think it wo n't be changed untill a major scandal . 
  i 've never heard a political scientist voice this concern . 
  if this constitution does n't work , and hence is unpopular , any sensible politician will try to change it . 
  edit : by the way , the current constitution states that the president can be elected with a simple majority of the mp from the 3rd vote . 
  the amendment modifies it to the majority of the ** voters ** , but from the 9th vote . 
  how is that authoritarian ? 
   it appears you have read only partial propaganda or you have well read the changes and not been able to understand consequences . 
    the government will be able to sell everything it wants to multinationals , concede to create , yes , but to be slave . 
  he may not win , but he will be able to tilt the political discourse in his favour the way sanders did . 
  18 % is ** a lot ** , and many parties wall want a share of that . 
   election of corte costituzionale and presidente della rep. 
  thanks to a always-changeable electoral law . 
  these two organs will be emanation of the first party , not of the first coalition . 
  always . 
  a party that takes control will be able to rest there forever thanks to our propaganda situation . 
  false . 
  if anything , the quorum for the election of the head of state would be higher than before . 
   the government will be able to sell everything it wants to multinationals , concede to create , yes , but to be slave . 
   more powerful governance = less workers ' rights and more banks ' interests . 
  depends on who you vote . 
  it 's democracy . 
   wo n't be able to re modify the contitution ** false . 
  false . 
  false . 
  **  this is the most scary bill of my life you must have read very few bills then . 
  the tide of history as in , the anti-establishment , populist movements that are spreading all over the western world . 
   nice slogan not a slogan . 
  this referendum will affect italian politics for a very long time , including the next elections . 
  you keep on denying it , but you know it 's true . 
  my priority should be the same as yours : living in a prosperous country . 
  that is why we have constitutions , governments and elections . 
  i believe this reform corrects some flaws in our current constitution , and if the referendum passes , i think that our country will be better-governed than if `` no '' wins . 
   do n't pretend you know what 's in the heart of all or most no voters you 're free to vote `` no '' for whatever reason you like , but do n't pretend that most people will vote based on their leader 's campaign . 
  and that all major opposition parties campaigned for the referendum not to pass because that would have weakened renzi . 
  you 're telling me to argue against your argument regarding m5s , but you do n't have an argument . 
  you 're just dodging the whole point of why i think it 's wrong to vote `` no '' : the ** consequences ** of the vote . 
  regarding your last point , i 'm not voting on the basis of which party i prefer : i 'm voting on the basis of which ** country ** i prefer . 
  schools mostly . 
  renzi is the only italian politician capable of swimming against the tide of history - which grillo and salvini are riding . 
  you may consider them weak , but so we 're brexiters and trump . 
  except they were n't . 
  voters do n't only decide on the constitutional reform . 
  they also decide on which country they want to live for the next few years - and a country where `` no '' wins is a country that , whether you like it or not , will make a m5s government much more likely . 
  voting responsibly means also taking into account the consequences of your vote . 
   voters to decide between the political establishment and rising populist forces in referendum that could see renzi resign this is true though . 
  there is no alternative to renzi which is n't populist - be it salvini or grillo . 
  and it is also true that if `` no '' wins a m5s government will be very likely , sooner or later . 
  he * himself * is the most popular politician in the country . 
  he 's also been governing for quite a lot now ( for italian standards ) , so that must also be taken into account . 
  ti be honest it is extremely common for the incumbent party to poll behind opposition parties . 
  the electoral campaign has n't started yet . 
  oh come on , please quit this bullshit . 
  the economist endorsed the `` no '' - and it was n't the only newspaper to do so . 
  you 're not victims , the media are n't against you , you 're not being misrepresented . 
  he 's still more popular than any other political leader . 
  considering how long he 's been in power , he 's pretty popular in my opinion . 
  what part is scary ? 
   house of lords can do a lot of delays . 
  the new senate too , and it will still have a say in the most important stuff , like constitutional amendments . 
   majorities are not guaranteed and are earned depending on how big your vote is . 
  lol no they 're not ? 
  the tories have the majority of the seats in parliament although they only earned less that 37 % of the votes . 
  with the new electoral law ( which is ** not ** part of this referendum and is likely to change whatever happens today ) if a party does n't reach a 40 % threshold there is a run-off vote . 
  have you actually read the reform ? 
  does the uk have unopposed rule ? 
   calling rightist stupid , xenophobic , homophobic and accusing them of cheating is exactly why moderate left parties are on a decline . 
  this argument is next level annoying as people keep on repeating it like a mantra although it has no basis whatsoever .
