for me sovereignty should always be a currency , wisely spend to advance freedoms and happiness of a nations citizens . 
  * this * . 
  but even though there are some salvini 's supporters who are fascists ( just think of his partnership with casapound ) , most of them are not . 
  his electoral basis consists mostly of conservatives and old lega supporters : bossi always defined himself as an anti-fascist , even though his policies were often far right . 
  australia is not surrounded by countries whence thousands and thousands of refugees set out ** everyday ** . 
  italy is . 
  of course we need different laws : we are , geographically and politically , in a totally different situation . 
  speaking of the us , as / u/sopadurso says , we ca n't consider their immigration laws an example , can we ? 
  i like it that in your twisted view obeying the international agreements we signed is a sign of incompetence . 
  seriously ? 
  no italy ? 
  are we gon na be * that * low ? 
  mostly by italians, 
  username checks out , 
  yeah right , 'cause that 's definitely not gon na make things much worse ... ^ / s, 
  i honestly wish it was n't , but it kinda is ... 
  definitely ... sure , not as expensive as london , 
  to be honest , right now i 'm totally happy with where i am . 
  living in milan , i get the best of both worlds : it 's in the north , so there is a decent labour market , the economy is not at all bad , services in general are pretty good and with a 2-hour flight i can be basically anywhere in europe . 
  plus , i love milan . 
  being in italy though , i can enjoy great weather , great food , stunning art and with a 2-ish hours ride i could both have swim in cinque terre or go skiing somewhere near switzerland . 
  sure , you ca n't get both the italian lifestyle and the nordic precision : but it 's a compromise i can totally accept . 
  edit : if i had to move , anyway , the only place i 've visited that made me think : `` yeah , i would n't mind living here '' was london . 
  basically because i know the language . 
  i 've never been to spain though , maybe i could also consider moving there ( probably barcelona ) . 
  i know some spanish but if i did n't i probably could n't tell it apart from greek . 
  the sounds are really , really similar - both are extremely harmonious and mediterranean . 
  all slavic language sound the same to me - and i actually like the way they sound , like a gentler german . 
  as an italian admitting it is incredibly hard , but french does sound good . 
  if you think about it , its sounds are quite harsh , but overall it is really melodic . 
  english can vary a lot , from the condescending posh sound of a southern english lady to the slang of a scotsman that is n't really that far apart from any other northern germanic language . 
  which means ugly . 
  scandinavian languages all sound the same - an uglier version of german . 
  never heard finnish , probably it would sound like a mix of slavic and germanic . 
  portuguese is just ugly . 
  it 's like hearing a spaniard with a terrible cold and a stick up their ass ... just no . 
  sorry guys . 
  i really ca n't tell german and dutch apart : both are kinda harsh but not as much as people say . 
  depends on who 's speaking , definitely not appealing languages though . 
  probably missing out on a few languages . 
  about italian , i find it very expressive and complete . 
  ca n't really say much though , since i hear it everyday and after a while it just sounds * normal * . 
  cool language though - probably my favourite after english and spanish ( the only languages i know to be honest ) . 
  by the way , the parish where this funeral took place is the same that refused to celebrate [ his ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piergiorgio_welby ) because his life choices `` did not conform to the catholic morals '' . 
  cool stuff . 
  update [ been there . 
  got two . 
  no regrets . 
  i sure will , sir . 
  i 'm actually landing in krak\u00f3w tomorrow . 
  pls save me some pierogi ... 
  what about milan ? 
  easy to reach , centre between the south and the north , not too far east and not too far west ... 
  but most importantly , i live there so i would n't have to move . ^ / s, 
  fascinating how some dialects in northern italy seem to have derived the term from arabic . 
  until this one i honestly thought you were italian !, 
  italian philosophy in a nutshell, 
  what about :  yes ... while italy has some issues , like economic inequality , organised crime and many bad politicians ( but what country 's perfect ? 
  ) , i live in one of the most beautiful countries in the world , i get to enjoy some great weather and the best food in existence . 
  it 's all about perspective . 
  rome is not northern italian . 
  there 's something called * centro italia * that has its economic and social peculiarities . 
  and tbh , i do believe that , in terms of services and job opportunities , there 's a much wider gap between milan and rome than rome and naples . 
  this is why i 'm convinced that , economy-wise , speaking of italy as a whole makes almost zero sense . 
  job market ? 
  gdp per capita ? 
  purchase power ? 
  hell , we 're really talking about two different countries . 
  man , you keep on talking cheap stereotypes and honestly you 're embarrassing yourself . 
  what 's gon na be next , italians not working until they eat their daily portions of pizza , * spaghetti bolougnaiss * and * fetucini alfredo * ? 
  honest question : for that amount , and given both the better quality of life and the greater purchase power , would n't it make sense to come back to italy ? 
  even though both salvini ( who 's been growing a lot lately , and i think is now around 20 % ) and grillo ( who 's lost plenty of consensus since the 2013 elections ) are suggesting we exit the eurozone , it is still extremely unlikely . 
  our gdp is finally starting to grow and renzi is pushing for all the structural reforms we 've been needing for so long . 
  not saying his reforms are the best possible , but they are something . 
  what 's more , renzi is an extremely able communicator : i do n't think italy 's ever seen such a charismatic leader since berlusconi . 
  the way renzi could is the next elections would be a terrible economic outcome in the next few years and a very unlikely salvini-grillo alliance . 
  i do n't think you guys will get rid of us easily !, 
  exactly . 
  you understand that the first sentence contradicts the second right ? 
   they 've been ravaging the part of italy in the south that 's relatively poor . 
  this is hilariously wrong . 
  although mafias have a stronger presence on the southern territory , they reinvest almost all their money in the north . 
  which means that no , they ravage both parts of italy equally . 
   i 'm pretty sure i know a hell of a lot more about this whole deal than you do , though , but never mind the facts !, 
  what facts ? 
  you 're saying nonsensical bs about the italian government only now starting to go after them when in fact there 's always been an effort . 
  like that idiot saying that the mafias and the state have a mutual interest to coexist . 
  makes zero sense . 
  the current democratic party ( pd ) is mainly composed by the most moderate parts of the ex commununist party ( pci ) and socialist party ( psi ) and the leftist members of the ex christian-democratic party ( dc ) . 
  the current party leader ( who also happens to be the prime minister ) is probably the most moderate and centrist leader the party has seen in its ( brief ) history . 
  here 's the thing : i do n't . 
  i just think that if you have the right to decide whether to have an abortion or not , then i have the right to decide whether to contribute financially to the raising of a child you decided to give birth to . 
  i think you can get it . 
  but you do realise that parenthood is n't just about women being pregnant , but it is a process that involves ** equally ** both the mother and the father , right ? 
   if you are pregnant and do n't want to be -  have an abortion  if someone else is pregnant and you do n't want them to be -  tough shit , buddy if you 're smart enough to type on a keyboard you can get where the inequality is . 
  in case you are n't , it 's right there . 
  if i make it clear beofehand that i do n't want a baby ( e.g. 
  wearing a condom that breaks , or consenting only if assured that my partner is on the pill but guess what she is n't ) no , i do n't hold myself responsible for the choice ** she ** will make whether to keep the baby or not . 
  you said that the only one affected by a pregnancy is the mother . 
  i said that no , it 's not .
