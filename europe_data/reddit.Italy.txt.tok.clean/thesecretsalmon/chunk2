  you then assume i was implying that women should have an abortion if told to do so and that they are their partners ' / fathers ' property . 
  nice strawman there . 
  way to go . 
  like , i 'm sorry ~ ~ men ~ ~ single mothers ca n't ~ ~ get pregnant ~ ~ take care of their children by themselves for the most part . 
  i 'm still not ceding control over my ~ ~ body ~ ~ personal finances and the next 20 + years of my life to any random ~ ~ dude ~ ~ chick out there . 
  ** ftfy **, 
  then you are admitting that women always have a plan b if they do n't want a baby , but men do n't . 
  does this really sound fair to you ? 
   the medical , emotional and associated risks of a pregnancy is carried solely by the pregnant person . 
  so if my partner has an abortion against my will i wo n't be emotionally affected ? 
  or if i find myself a baby i did n't want in the first place i wo n't have to bear the psychological , and financial burden just because i am a man ? 
  having a child is not only about the nine months of pregnancy : it 's a process of 20 + years in which theoretically both parents should be equally involved . 
   this means they [ * pregnant people , i.e. 
  women , i suppose * ] ca n't have a say about what happens with the foetus , either . 
  [ ca n't they ? 
  ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=abortion ), 
  vasectomies are n't 100 % effective and condoms sometimes break . 
  next . 
  the problem is , men have no say in the transition * foetus -  baby * . 
  and this is , like it or not , unfair ( despite your witty semantics ) . 
  ok , very nice and all , but what this man says has - thank goodness - zero influence on the matter . 
  he 's a priest . 
  here we 're talking politics . 
  different subjects , different people whose opinion is worth discussing . 
  milano centrale is quite cool tbh . 
  he specifically said he does n't want grillo or salvini to win the elections . 
  if were a right winger , he would n't have said so . 
  he said the lesser evil is renzi , and despite the leftist propaganda claiming the contrary , renzi definitely is n't for right wingers . 
  right wingers in italy now either vote grillo or salvini . 
  berlusconi is gone , renzi has the moderates and some of the leftists . 
  so no , op definitely does n't sound like a right winger . 
  yeah but this is a public discussion and not everyone speaks french . 
  please , english . 
   -  no ticumptalism ( ? ), 
  triumphalism maybe ? 
  i 'm sorry , but claiming that the situation in italy is anywhere near the one they have in greece is not `` writing the truth and nothing more '' : it is perpetuating misconceptions and idiotic propaganda . 
  have we got our fair share of issues ? 
  sure we do . 
  is the situation dramatic ? 
  there are areas where it is , but tbh there have always been . 
  but i can feel the pain and the anger in op 's words and i honestly ca n't say that we 're anywhere near that . 
  actually it absolutely is n't , but who am i to oppose your ( and many of my compatriots ' ) inferiority complex ? 
  oh do n't worry , we 're pretty good at that too !, 
  can you actually survive this kind of stuff ? 
  i mean , what are the temperatures ? 
  plus , is n't it hazardous to be that close to the engines ? 
  even though it is undeniable that norway has many more refugees per capita than italy , you just ca n't only take that into consideration : also the gdp and the population density are important factors to determine if a country physically can welcome more people . 
  and yes , you give more than us in foreign aids , but hey , do you really want to compare our economic situations ? 
  oh , btw , i 'm sure that if we save a few millions a year ( like what , 0,00001 % of our gdp ? ), 
  from our politicians ' salaries we 'll have solved our biggest issue and hundreds of thousands if not millions of other migrants wo n't have reached our shores in the meantime ! ^ s, 
   is someone from southern nigeria that claims they 're running away from boko haram a refugee ? 
  i do n't know the criteria , but i suppose they 're not . 
  there are interpreters and anthropologists whose work is to define where someone is from . 
  i for one would never be able to impersonate a neapolitan convincingly . 
  i guess that 's the same for a nigerian or a somalian . 
   if they 're refugees why did n't they stop in one of the numerous safe countries between their origin and destination ? 
  most of them do . 
  others either already have friends or relatives in europe , or choose to seek asylum in a developed country instead of moving to a poor and socially unstable area . 
  i would do the same . 
   i do n't care . 
  i do n't trust those people . 
  i do n't care of what what you care . 
  i care about facts , and facts ( see the economist article that was posted here few days ago ) say most of them are refugees . 
  even though i believe the uncr is still fair and it does n't need to be changed , i think italy should make the eu hear its voice on the dublin convention - it 's just ridiculous and ** that 's ** the subject that needs to be addressed . 
  the right of a person to see their asylum rights recognised should not be on the table . 
  since the journey is very expensive and physically exhausting , not to mention very dangerous , i guess it makes sense if many families decide to first send the man/father so that he can build some economic stability before the rest of the family arrive via more `` traditional '' routes, 
   whoever promises to send everyone back to libya . 
  whatever they promise , ** nobody can ** . 
  it 's against international agreements . 
   being a refugee is about safety not economic upliftment . 
  and also being able to have a family without seeing them starve to death etc. 
  you would be absolutely right , ** if ** : * most of the people who flee from war-stricken areas did n't look for refuge in nearby regions ; * the socioeconomic situation of such areas were comparable to even the poorest countries in the eu ; * there were n't strict criteria to determine whether the migrants who reach our shores are actually potential refugees and , most of all , the majority of their applications were declined . 
  do i really have to tell you all these premises are false or you can do your homework and find that out yourself ? 
  not sure if you 're joking or just plain ignorant . 
  anyway , [ nigeria ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=boko+haram ) and [ mali ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mali+civil+war ) are n't the best example you could 've picked . 
  that 's a bit simplistic , let 's just say they 're in a very complicated and dysfunctional relationship, 
  you could start posting in english only yourself . 
  the italian pm , which you 'd know if you 'd read the article, 
  it 's a quote from renzi, 
  ... and i 'm sure that your opinion is worthier than the lives of thousands . 
  honestly , i have no idea . 
  theoretically , it could be done by seriously enforcing the state 's presence in the most crime-stricken areas . 
  to be fair , many historians believe that the fascist regime effectively dismantled mafias in the south this way ( and that they were brought back after wwii ) . 
  the thing is , that would mean creating a police state in some regions , and that 's both a huge investment and a terribly unpopular choice . 
  but i 'm not an expert and this is a very complicated issue : it 's about culture , society , politics . 
  let 's just say that if you want to fight mafias , you need to address corruption and infiltrations first - and it seems this government is going that way , but this is surely not something you sort out in a year or two . 
  what do you mean ? 
  if you 're asking about the everyday experience , yes it is different . 
  there are towns in the south completely controlled by mafias : racket ( the so-called * pizzo * ) , violent crimes , drugs : it 's all about them . 
  it 's much more entrenched into the everyday life and society . 
  from what i 've heard , you just * feel * that it 's there . 
  but that does n't mean that mafias do n't operate in the north : in fact , the richer an area is , the more profitable it is for them . 
  although certainly much , much rarer , racket is still a thing in the north . 
  honestly , i have never happened to feel the presence of organised crime in my area myself , even though it often turns out they infiltrate events , banks , companies . 
  let 's just say that the money they make in the south , they invest it in the north . 
  probably it has much to do with the south-north situation . 
  i mean , if the overall gdp stagnates , that might very well mean that lombardia , veneto and piemonte have grown just as much as germany and the uk , but sicily and calabria are still deeply in recession . 
  that means that , unlike more homogeneous economies , gdp growth in italy does not affect the population that much . 
  there are much more important factors such as unemployment rate ( which is fairly low in the north , which often means that when people get new jobs they get them in the south ) .
