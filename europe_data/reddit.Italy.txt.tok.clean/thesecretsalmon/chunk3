  needless to say , he did n't reprehend him . 
  * he used to sing racist chants towards neapolitans . 
  needless to say , he stopped when he realised neapolitans can vote too . 
  * he is adopting some typically fascistic mottos like `` italians first '' and `` stop the invasion '' . 
  they 're not racist per se , but it is undeniable that they 're directed towards racist and angry people so that they vote for him . 
  1 ) by `` you ca n't '' , i mean there 's the un refugee convention preventing us from doing so . 
  and is your country gon na pay for the dozens of flights every week ? 
  2 ) libya ** does n't want them ** . 
  is that so hard to understand ? 
  who should they rat out specifically ? 
  here 's what we got . 
  thousands of people from dozens of different countries . 
  you ca n't expect each of them to know where the others come from . 
  do you really think that if you put a nigerian and a kenyan in front of the average syrian he 'll be more capable than you at telling them apart ? 
  and btw , we do interrogate them . 
  the thing is , without a little help from our friends ( as in , you guys ) we ca n't just handle all of them . 
  right now the protocol is to help those who have right to asylum and deport those who do n't . 
  the thing is , we ca n't handle all of them and make sure they leave the eu if we 're left totally alone on this . 
  oh come on , seriously ? 
   some of them are refugees . 
  you just ** ca n't ** prevent them from landing . 
  by ** ca n't ** i do n't just mean it would be wrong and inhumane ( and it would ) : there are ** laws ** we signed that prevent us from doing it . 
  international agreements we ca n't ignore just because some people disagree with them . 
  that 's not how politics work . 
  1 ) you ca n't 2 ) to where ? 
  you still need to identify them and figure out where they 're from , and please do n't say to libya because they want them as much as you do . 
  some of them are refugees . 
  you just ca n't prevent them from landing . 
  the reason these trips are that expensive is that smugglers know people can afford them . 
  barely , but they can . 
  the moment they realise these desperate ca n't pay that much , prices will drop immediately . 
  nothing new under the sun , that 's how the market works . 
  he 's old and tired - i do n't blame him . 
  he probably ca n't take it anymore . 
  the thing is , i quiver when i think the only alternative he left to renzi is that racist prick of salvini . 
  not that berlusconi was better , but ... hell , he probably was . 
  this . 
  you ca n't just agree on international treaties and then turn your back on presumed refugees because `` no one would care '' . 
  please tell me you 're joking . 
  you 're seriously comparing a `` colonial empire '' that lasted something like ** 60 years ** with ** centuries and centuries ** of deportations and exploitation and oppression ? 
  you just ca n't be serious . 
  as if they would n't try and come back again . 
  and again . 
  and again . 
  no , they 're not . 
  they are supposed to reinterpret it based on the new testament , which means that they often do n't follow it literally ( very few catholics believe that adam and eve * actually * existed ) , but they still think it is god and everything . 
  anyhow , there are a few radical christian cults that believe in everything the bible says , including creationism according to the genesis and that you should n't eat pork and you should stone people to death . 
  i 'm not a catholic and you do n't have to convince me of anything . 
  just saying that catholics are christians who believe in christ and all that stuff . 
  you can quote the old testament as much as you like , that wo n't change anything . 
  well but you know , there are a few things like the ten commandments and dogmas and all the obligations you 're supposed to stick to if you consider yourself christian . 
  catholics are monotheistic . 
  they do also worship mary and the saints ( hell it 's complicated ) , but catholicism is a form of christianity and it 's absolutely 100 % monotheistic . 
  hell no . 
  catholics ** are ** christians . 
  after the east-west schism in 1054 , christianity sort of split in two : the orthodox church set in eastern europe and the western church lead by the pope in rome . 
  anyhow , many alternative cristian movements rose in europe throughout the centuries , and around the xvi century the western christian community separated again ( i 'm simplifying this ** a lot ** ) and was divided into catholics ( loyal to the pope ) and protestants ( who followed many preachers like martin luther , john calvin etc. ) . 
  so yes , they are christian and pray to christ ( not exclusively , but that 's complicated ) . 
  me too !, 
  and it was shot in my town !, 
  i only watched the second semifinal and tbh the only song that got stuck in my head was the one from the guy from israel . 
  apart from that , it all felt a bit dull ( but i found lithuania 's kiss hilariously cute ) . 
  but our guys are stereotypical enough to give us a shot . 
  and they 're singing in italian , so people wo n't realise how ridiculous the lyrics are . 
  granted that a referendum on that subject would probably be against our constitution , i must admit i 'm not sure of how i feel about a referendum . 
  yes , it is true that it 's something that only concerns a minority of the population , but you must also consider that it would influence e.g. 
  the pension system , therefore having repercussions on the population as a whole . 
  anyhow , i am pretty sure that a referendum on civil unions ( maybe even marriage , probably not adoptions ) would pass quite easily , although i think that acting through the parliament would be a simpler , quicker and overall better choice . 
  you need to understand that the common marked has always been part of something bigger : a political design you are absolutely entitled not to want to be part of , but only if you accept every consequence of that choice . 
  i think the uk 's already got its fair share of opt-outs . 
  in italy we have a saying that goes : * you ca n't have both a full barrel and a drunken wife * . 
  really , what 's the point in joining the eu if you opt-out from basically everything ? 
  i love the uk and i really wish you guys would stay , but here 's the thing : the eu has many perks , but if you want them you 'll also need to give something up ( be it sovereignty , migrant quotas or whatever ) . 
  if you 're not willing to do so , i hate to say it , but you know , * the door is right there * . 
  i ca n't see it going anywhere tbh . 
  neither uk nor greece have any interest in leaving the eu , which anyway remains the slow , bureaucratic dinasaur we 're now used to . 
  pane it 's is a shame : i believe in europe , i love europe and i feel like i am part of it . 
  and i know that one day we will see a united europe . 
  i just hope that it wo n't take too long . 
  for those who understand italian , i 'd recommend watching [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymz6cwi_n18 ) , which is probably all that we will remember of these days of protesting, 
  i have mixed feelings about it . 
  it certainly is more functional , since it - usually - results in a two-party race , which makes it much easier to form a government . 
  furthermore , it allows many local parties to have at least some representation . 
  on the other hand , though , it often leaves out the votes of many , many people , and , as a consequence , may not be too democratic . 
  but honestly , like any other electoral system , it mainly depends on the context : in a country with mostly two big contenders and , other than those , a few local parties it actually does make sense ( even if you have to compromise and give away proportional representation ) . 
  in countries with a few big parties running for government , it 's probably better to give up some effectiveness for the sake of equality . 
   italy 's problems are hugely connected to the euro . 
  oh yeah , corruption , slow bureaucracy , mafia and antiquated mentality have absolutely nothing to do with our issues - it 's all about the currency , right ? 
  you 're assuming that maintaining your national sovereignty instead of gradually integrating into the eu will be in the long run positive for the uk . 
  which , according to most studies , wo n't happen . 
   why give up the ability to determine your own future ( ... ) ? 
  as if , assuming that the uk leaves , it wo n't be affected by the eu almost as much as it is now , without being able to work within the european institutions ( just look at switzerland ) . 
  oh come on , italy 's problems have very little to do with our currency . 
  and the assumption that sovreignty itself gives more chances at prosperity is totally arbitrary . 
  if you really consider the concept of `` sovereignty '' itself more important then your country 's economic well being , then i really have no idea what to tell you, 
  the thing is smugglers often charge migrants several thousands of dollars : as you can imagine , most families just ca n't afford to leave all at once . 
  i suppose they send men first so that they can get a job and help the others pay for the journey . 
  italy is not a federal state . 
  we do have regions , but not countries . 
  i agree this case took too long to reach a verdict ( 8 years ?
