gary kasparov is really sunk so low ? 
  now he is just referred as a russian opposition activist ? 
  he was the best chess player in the world for decades !, 
  yes , but it 's easy to understand , generally you do n't go peach nor peel fishing . 
  we do n't have a real name for it , we just call it correct pronounce . 
  my favourite false friend is the italian `` cavarsela '' , that means to manage , while in spanish has a complete different meaning , 
  i 'm pretty sure one is the `` e '' that is pronounced differently https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f35ofhstlhy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f35ofhstlhy p\u00e9sca means peach p\u00e8sca means fishing so the meaning of the words can change very much . 
  beware that we do n't use the accent in this case , i wrote it like this just to make you understand better . 
  the other one i guess that is the o that can be open or closed , but i di n't find examples . 
  not really , we just use the latin alphabet . 
  there are only differences in the phonetics . 
  so maybe you will need something similar , we have characters like \u00e0 , \u00f9 , \u00f2 , \u00ec that you might do n't have on your keyboard , given that it is a spanish one . 
  i found spanish easy to learn due to the similarities between our languages , but there are some hilarious false friends . 
  for example `` burro '' in spanish means donkey , while in italian means butter , so if you call someone burro you are not really insulting him . 
  so if you will learn italian pay attention and write a lot . 
  however , spanish is amazing , it sounds really great . 
  yes , i 'm trying to learn spanish . 
  at the beginning of my studies i found it easier to paste the characters from one of these sites to a.txt file , so when i wrote in spanish on my computer it was faster than using the ascii code, 
  so you do care , 
  both ronaldo and ronaldinho were the bests in their role , when they were at the top . 
  for me ronaldo was the best player that i had ever seen simply because there was n't a forward like him before : he was strong , agile , useful to the team , intelligent , he had a powerful shot , an incredible dribbling skill , a precise pass . 
  what i found really incredible was his ability to feint to gain a real profit to the opposer . 
  after the injuries , he was n't the same physically and also had a thyroid problem that led him to gain weight , but could always be one of the strongest forward simply playing inside the penalty area . 
  ronaldinho , on the other hand , was maybe even better in his early barcellona period , but he did n't last much . 
  he was very very agile and had an incredible pass , he could find the best solution at any time . 
  too bad he decided that he did n't had to train , because he was so strong . 
  i think that is referred to the spacial characters spanish has , like '' \u00f1 \u00e1 , \u00ed , \u00f3 , \u00bf , \u00a1 '' . 
  when you do grammar exercises you have to type them and they are n't available on most of the foreign keyboards . 
  the brazilian ronaldo was way better than the portuguese . 
  georgia on my mind , but not on romanians ' one . 
  fair enough . 
   the eu , lead by the italians , prop up a western friendly government that over time turns into a regime sources please . 
  in the 15th/16th century syphilis was called like that in almost all parts of europe . 
  some of the soldiers that sailed to america with columbus were then hired as mercenaries in the army of the french king charles viii during the first of the italian wars . 
  when they arrived to naples , they spread the disease in the city , that 's the reason why it was named the gallic disease or the french disease . 
  there 's no blame in having stereotypes , the blame is in having such a difficult and unspeakable language , sharing it with the austrians , and in allowing them to call themselves germans without even anschlussing them . 
  right , i did n't notice it, 
  basically german stereotypes about europe in the eighteenth century . 
  however it is funny to see how turkey was already considered europe in those days . 
  it 's still a better criterion than comparing two random cities , as parma is not even in the [ top ten of the italian most populated cities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_in_italy ) , while wroclaw is like the [ fourth biggest polish city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_and_towns_in_poland ), 
  comparing the two capitals gives different results http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=italy&amp;country2=poland&amp;city1=rome&amp;city2=warsaw, 
   akhlaghi was sentenced to 100 years of community work and ordered to pay # 85 costs and a victim surcharge of # 60 . 
  i hope that when he is 134 , the judge will have mercy of him . 
  `` fachas '' means just fascists or has some other denigratory meaning ? 
   when i get injury , i get injury . 
  i never take nothing to be back quicker . 
  so i guess that he does n't even go to the hospital . 
  maybe this is n't the best place to ask this , but here is my question : are there areas that are really against the bourbons , like for example catalonia ? 
  and do you think that there will be sooner or later any referendum about the monarchy ? 
  thanks . 
  [ the casino of campione d'italia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/campione_d'italia_03.jpg ), 
  italy - two of the four italian workers , that had been kidnapped in libya last july , have been killed during a fight between thugs . 
  [ the other two have been released and are now in italy ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/libya-italy-hostages-idusl5n16e0p8?rpc=401 ) . 
  there are some speculations about the payment of a ransom by the italian government . 
  the pm has also said that italy wo n't commit larger troops in libya for now . 
  corbyn 's party is never going to have the majority in next elections , i mean until corbyn is in charge , and i ca n't see the ukip or the liberal democrats winning neither . 
  of course it 's harder to change the tax policy under the eu , because of the rules and so on , but as far as tax evasion it seems to me that , since the luxembourg leaks , something is changing . 
  it is true that it takes time to change eu treaties , but it is still possible . 
  david cameron dealt with eu last month and a partial change of some treaties has been approved . 
  however , every choice implies that you get some and you lose some , so if the uk choses to stay in europe it will keep giving some of its powers to eu , while if it leaves , nobody really knows what will happen . 
  interesting , but i ca n't forget that the british government [ is doing all that is possible ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/30/google-tory-battle-protect-30bn-tax-haven-bermuda ) to help corporations in their effort to do n't pay taxes in uk . 
  i think he is being sarcastic . 
  serbia is landlocked , so they do n't have a navy . 
  you do n't need a navy when you win european water polo championship . 
  you just send your men against the boats and make them throw balls against the enemy until his navy sink . 
  i 'm sorry , siena does n't mean anything in italian and the name of the city has not certain etymology . 
  maybe your friend did n't know what to say and he told you that it meant fortress . 
  maybe they did n't suffer from the war itself , but they did suffer from its consequences for sure . 
  the rise of the fascist party was a direct consequence of italy 's participation to ww1 and both de gasperi and spinelli were arrested . 
  and triggered the u.s.a. entry in ww1 with its [ u-boot warfare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u-boat_campaign_%28world_war_i%29#1917:_resumption_of_unrestricted_submarine_warfare ), 
  i did n't know that , thank you very much !, 
  yes , sardinian is a really peculiar language , that is not so known . 
  i will post something when i 'll find something interesting . 
  italian and sardinian have days ' names almost like french : ita sar eng - luned\u00ec - lunis - monday - marted\u00ec - maltis - tuesday - mercoled\u00ec - m\u00e8rculis - wednesday - gioved\u00ec - giob\u00eca - thursday - venerd\u00ec - cen\u00e0bada - friday - sabato - s\u00e0badu - saturday - domenica - domingu - sunday friday in sardinian ( cen\u00e0bada ) has an uncertain etymology , maybe it comes from the latin `` cena pura '' meaning pure dinner , as in the christian and hebraic tradition no meat should be eaten during that day . 
  ok , maybe you are right , or maybe not , it has o be proven with some scientific experience . 
  in the meanwhile , the italian state can start to guarantee the same rights to gay couples as it does with traditional couples , as it seems that it does n't hurt anyone . 
  children grow better when they have both parents , but there is n't any serious scientific article that sustain that they have to be a male and a female . 
  for example they can adopt children and raise them . 
  at least we do n't have the bourbons anymore . 
  is it a rhetorical question ? 
  - on wednesday the reform of the constitution [ has been approved by the senate ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-reform-idukkcn0uy2qo ) . 
  it still has to be approved by the italian people through a referendum , that will be held in october . 
  the prime minister matteo renzi has announced that he will leave politics if it wo n't be approved . 
  - the opposition leader of the movement 5 stars , beppe grillo , has announced that he will make a step aside . 
  if you do n't like the genre , than do n't watch it , but maybe [ this clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq-ukgppvdy ) from the sequel is explaining, 
  i 'm not sure , it was quite common also in the past . 
  have you ever seen the movie `` il medico della mutua '' with alberto sordi and its sequel ? 
  it 's quite explaining of how the old italian national health service worked . 
  in italy a lot of private hospitals prefer cesarean births over natural births because are paid much more by the state , as they are considered surgery . 
  maybe in turkish hospitals doctors get paid more for the same reason, 
  yes !, 
  there 's nothing better than [ real estate ] ( https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewiz0_rtkbzkahwbuhqkhqk6bz4qfggjmaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fspanish_property_bubble&amp;usg=afqjcnehbqpthloltiwcg0_uj7ycfsnqha&amp;bvm=bv.112064104,d.d24 ) !, 
  hahaha !, 
  nice !, 
  they are going to [ fire people ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/11962187/deutsche-bank-stumbles-to-record-6.1bn-loss.html ) , this is what they mean with cost cuts . 
  also , db 's total assets [ were eur 1,694 billion ] ( https://www.db.com/ir/en/content/ir_releases_2015_5023.htm ) at 30 july 2015 ( it 's the last i could find ) . 
  anyway is all the european banking sector that [ is not in good health ] ( www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/24/european-banks-one-trillion-euros-bad-debt ) . 
  anyway , i 'm not an economist , so it 's just my opinion , 
  yes , but i guess that deutsche bank will not fail for 6,7 billion of euros, 
  it 's not possible anymore , since the 1 january of this year .
