  with the [ brrd ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11947986/eu-takes-member-states-to-court-over-bail-in-laws-to-protect-taxpayers.html ) ms merkel has decided that the private sector creditors will pay for banks ' bail in . 
  this means that if you own stocks or you have deposits of more than $ 100.000 you will be likely to lose them . 
  so what ? 
  some peshmergas sold their weapons on the black market in erbil , but the arcticle does n't explain which is the size of this phenomena . 
  sardinia : [ mamuthones ] ( http://www.sardegnaturismo.it/en/article/carnival-mamoiada ) or https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/mamuthones . 
  they can have different names and the weight of the bells can be different , if you consider different villages . 
  i 'm disappointed with seville not having a special colour in this map . 
  how is called the dialect spoken in trieste ? 
  after the recent events in eastern ukraine , has anybody changed his way of speaking ? 
  for example , someone who used to speak an ukrainian dialect or russian who changed to ukrainian ? 
  there are some networks that have only local coverage and the tv news are different in every region . 
  in the national network ( rai ) 20 regional tv news are broadcast at the same time in all italy , each of them has different journalists and different news . 
  the language that is used is always italian , but i guess that in alto adige / s\u00fcdtirol german is used for broadcasts . 
  in corsica people do n't speak italian ( at least , not the majority ) , speak an italian dialect . 
  in sardinia italian is widely known and taught in school . 
  it is also the official language and it 's used in the local parliament . 
  i can speak only for the place where i 've lived . 
  in sardinia , dialects are used in everyday life , also among the youngsters . 
  in campania young people use it , but as an `` italianized '' version . 
  in umbria is used mostly by olders , even though you can hear a very strong accent when people speak in italian . 
  let 's say that those who live in the areas with roman numbers can easily understand each other . 
  as you go farer from that region , the possibilities of understanding are less and less . 
  for example someone who live in corsica ( xiv ) can understand those who speak gallurese ( xv ) , but ca n't understand those speaking palermitano ( xxx ) . 
  the central and southern parts of sardinia have their own language , that is called [ sardinian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sardinian_language ) . 
  it is not an italian dialect , but a different romance language and there are , of course , a lot of dialects of saridinian . 
  in alghero , a city on the west coast , [ algherese is spoken ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algherese_dialect ) . it is instead a catalan dialect, 
  fca , the corporation that owns fiat and crysler , has been accused by two american salers [ of conspiring to inflate sales ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/01/14/fiat-chrysler-sales-lawsuit/78783142/ ) . 
  as a consequence , the firm has lost 8 % on thursday and more than 4 % on friday at the wall street nyse . 
  the mayor of quarto ( near naples ) [ has been ejected from her party ] ( http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2016/01/12/quarto-mayor-ejected-from-m5s_c70e1339-4283-438e-bc83-bbf1302c5255.html ) , the five stars movement ( m5s ) . 
  the reason that has been given is that she allegedly did n't report to the authorities a blackmail made by some politicians on behalf of the camorra . 
  it 's the first time the m5s is involved in such an incident . 
  as a result , the political debate has been inflamed . 
  some italian names of famous people from the past , that somehow are still used , are pretty original : dante ( short form of durante ) , galileo , amerigo , cangrande ( the translation is bighound ) , mastino ( mastiff ) , desiderio ( desire ) , ferruccio ( iron ) , cavalcante ( the rider ) , romeo ( something like roman ), 
  brothers of italy has just 8 seats on the chamber of deputies : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brothers_of_italy . 
  new force was voted by 0.26 % of the italian population on 2013 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_force_%28italy%29 . 
  i googled domenico libri and salvatore zambrino , but i coul n't find any significant result . 
  it 's duce , not duche , even if we can both agree that the duce was a douche . 
  relevant username . 
  well , they could have said that as rajoy was going to be the candidate president for the 7th ( ? ), 
  time , he was the problem and not the psoe . 
  i think that people are tired of seeing rajoy all the time . 
  in the event of a new election , many people would have voted against him ( but this is just my impression from outside ) . 
  it seems to me an ill considered choice on psoe 's behalf . 
  this way , they are going to split their party and lose many voters . 
  they should have demanded the ~ ~ dimissions ~ ~ resignation of rajoy as a `` conditio sine qua non '' for voting a pp government in the parliament and they should have been very clear on this from the beginning . 
  i 'm not sure that i understand . 
  should we kill the immigrants or southern italians ? 
  what if a southern italian immigrate to the north , should we kill him 2 times ? 
  also , i 'm a southern italian that emigrated , should i kill myself now 2 times ? 
  ( the last question would be harder to accomplish : italians from the south have the lowest rate of suicide in the country . ), 
  i think it too , 
  i do n't think that southern universities are of bad quality , i just blame the nepotistic attitude that professors have . 
  just to make you an example , when i started universities they ~ ~ had ~ ~ wanted to repeat the entrance test because of irregularities in bari and catanzaro . 
  that same year , half of the scores over 70 were in the university of messina , where there were rumors of a professor doing `` particular courses '' that assured you to pass the exam . 
  i 'm sure that things are better now , but when i began they were n't . 
  edit : typos, 
  i studied medicine , at the time there were 3 universities in my region with that degree and they were known for nepotism . 
  the other southern universities were even worse , so i decided to go north . 
  afterward i regretted this choice , edit : because i think the university were i studied was no better , but that 's it . 
  they actually do it . 
  i 've emigrated myself for studying , because there were n't a lot of universities where i could study what i wanted in the south . 
  as southern italy is poorer than the northern counterpart , there are less foreigners and therefore the majority of people seeking ~ ~ for ~ ~ economic help is italian . 
  at least he put the source . 
  they are not nordic countries though , they may jusy simply have higher infections levels . 
  or they may have a screening program that is better than the italian one . 
  or both . 
  not to forget that this study analise just hepatits c , not to all the stis . 
  edit : it may also be dued to the fact that some countries use different standards to define hepatitis c ( someone includes chronic infections and some other does n't ) edit 2 : i just checked , if you look at table 2 in the link i posted , you can see that italy does n't say if the new diagnosis are from acute or chronic infections , while latvia and estonia count both . 
  so if you look at the numbers of acute infections , you can see that they are not that high . 
   first of its group stable governments , investments on infrastructures and universities , low corruption levels and a currency that favour our exports . 
  these are all the things that we have n't . 
  on the other hand our football team was relativeley well trained and our coach did his best in the last euro cup , so we won the first two matches and we ended first on our ~ ~ round ~ ~ group . 
  edit : typo, 
  yes , that 's what the article suggests . 
  the new cases reported are higher in nordic countries , because they make more tests in people who may get infected by hepatitis c ( for example drug addicts ) but the estimated prevalence ( the number of people who shows to have been in contact with the hcv from blood analysis ) is low . 
  countries that are n't eu members . 
  http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/hepatitis-c/by-country/ this is just the first that i found , so i do n't know the metodology and nothing else . 
  as soon as i find a better version , i 'll edit this comment . 
  edit : i wrote too late :(, 
  this is the source : http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/hepatitis_c/pages/annual-epidemiological-report.aspx edit : just a clarification :  indeed , many northern european countries , which have extensive testing programmes targeting populations at risk , report the highest notification rates in the eu/eea , but are also known from serosurveys to have low-prevalence estimates [ 1 , 4 ] . 
  by comparison , the countries in the east and south-east of europe have the lowest reported rates of cases , but the highest prevalence estimates . 
  this discrepancy highlights the challenge of interpreting hepatitis c surveillance data and the importance of considering the data alongside other sources of information such as local testing practices and seroprevalence estimates . 
   that 's exactly how it is !, 
  you do not understand what the word indigenous means , apparently . 
  indigenous , from the latin `` indigenus '' from `` indi '' ( in ) and `` gignere '' ( generate ) so it literaly means `` generated inside '' [ that land ] . 
   are white people indigenous to america ?? 
  should native americans claim the rule of the u.s. ?? 
   just . 
  random ... 
  most of northern estonia lives around tallinn . 
  from the wikipedia article about estonian demographics :  however , in harju county ( which includes the national capital , tallinn ) and ida-viru county , ethnic estonians make up only 59.6 % ( 55.0 % in tallinn ) and 19.7 % of the population , respectively . 
  in those two counties , russians account for 32.4 % ( 36.4 % in tallinn ) and 71.2 % of the population , respectively . 
  in the nation as a whole , russians make up 24.8 % of the total population . 
  [ 15 ] should i ignore minorities only because they are within your national borders ? 
   by what sane standards would the whole country have a say in one region using its right to self determination ?? 
  it goes directly against the essence of that right itself !, 
  i 'll try to explain this to you for the last time and i 'll try to be as accurate as i can . 
  when the spanish constitution was written , spain found itself in a very delicate situation . 
  franco was dead and the dictatorship was over , but how would have the new state been like ? 
  if catalonia ( or other regions of spain ) were to secede in that moment of spanish history , you can bet whatever you want that there would have been another bloody civil war .
