  if you really want to be the number one , you have to wait 70 years without government and even then , you must always remember that we did it before it was cool . 
  yeah , successful is n't the best word that op could choose . 
  edit : typo, 
  by the way berlusconi was a singer , even if not successful at all . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/worldnews/8878966/silvio-berlusconi-in-pictures.html the artist in the picture is claudio baglioni and i do n't understand how he can be the most successful singer in italy https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_estimated_best-selling_music_artists, 
   it is dying in south america too , fast and steady . 
  do you mean that people are just less religious or that they are becoming protestants ? 
  or both ? 
  they staged a terrorist attack and that is a crime . 
  in most countries ( i think that czech republic is among those ) it could be prosecuted as ~ ~ offense ~ ~ criminal simulation . 
  through out history , they have also been very kind toward their subjects . 
  that 's why nowdays nobody swears in central italy and if someone does it , he is immediatly blamed by the entire community . 
  vatican city . 
  i was imaging something like this , in the end it was a sort of blackmail by ryanair , but if it will bring more investiments and tourists to italy , i 'm for once happy that the government gave up with its demands . 
  first , they were threatening to shut down their [ flights to alghero and pescara ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/economia/finanza/2016/02/02/news/ryanair_taglia_600_posti_di_lavoro-132573822/ ) , now they are announcing new jobs . 
  i 'm curious to know what has the government given up in order to make ryanair change its mind . 
  so much ado for nothing . 
  i want cape verde in the eu . 
   erdogan told rai news 24 tuesday that the probe `` could put our relations with italy in difficulty '' and added that italy should instead concentrate on the mafia . 
  he could instead concentrate on his country , that he is making sink so low . 
  i heard about it in newspaper , but i had to google to know more about it . 
  it is basically a hill where mafia built houses illegally and now artists have come there to make it better . 
  sounds interesting , thanks . 
  yes , naples would be a valid alternative to bologna , people there are really different from the rest of italy and much more open to strangers . 
  you are right , the first thing that you would notice is that they walk very fast . 
  also when you are there you can eat the original pizza ( it was invented there ) and you can also visit a lot of places nearby ( pompei , paestum , oplonti , caserta , capri , costiera amalfitana ) you just have to chose . 
  other italians hate naples for a lot of reason and it would take a lot to explain why , but most people from there are absolutely ok and very friendly . 
  yes , naples would be a valid alternative to bologna , if you arrive there directly . 
  you can also visit a lot of places nearby ( pompei , paestum , oplonti , caserta , salerno ) you just have to chose . 
  i 've been in siracusa when i was a kid , so i ca n't help you very much . 
  what i remember is `` l'orecchio di dioniso '' , that is a giant cave made by the tyrant of siracuse in order to hear what people told about him , but i 'm sure that there is much more to see . 
  outside of siracusa i remember the noto cathedral and catania ( i think it 's woth to visit it ) , and the etna volcano . 
  for what i know public transports are terrible there and in that case i would suggest you to rent a car , but i can be wrong . 
  you should . 
  there are a lot of important monuments in a small place with a lot of young people during the night . 
  there are a lot of international students , people are very open , everything is really suggestive . 
  i tried to be realistic , these city are not so far to each other so you can spend at least 2 days visiting them . 
  venice is farer so you have to spend more time travelling and more money , and it is my understanding that op wanted to visit just 3 places , otherwise i would have suggested much more cities . 
  on the other hand i 've never been to venice so i do n't really know it . 
  maybe someone who is from there can give more details . 
  this article is 7 years old . 
  rome , florence and bologna are well connected each other and are pretty alive at night , a lot of cultural events , concerts and so on . 
  they also have very beautiful monuments . 
  if you had come sooner i would have suggested you also perugia , but the main event ( umbria jazz ) has gone and during august there is n't really much to do . 
  you know , sky news is owned by rupert murdoch . 
  28/07/1914 , the austro-hungaric empire declared war on serbia and triggered a chain reaction of declarations of war that ultimately ended in the first world war . 
  edit : my country ( italy ) will declare war on austria-hungary , only one year later , siding the entente cordiale, 
  it 's the only one where someone dies , so you were right to put it , otherwise someone could have objected '' but no one have died '' . 
   mann t\u00f6tet hure und sich selbst mit messer reading the bild 's headlines is always a pleasure :d, 
  what the hell is happening these days ? 
  i agree with you that the first thought is about islamic terrorism , as it is more frequent . 
  what i find strange is that some people seems almost happy when they hear that the terrorist is an islamist . 
  yesterday i red about the munich attack in this subreddit ( do n't remember where ) and there was someone saying something like : this year the right will gain a lot of votes because of this . 
  i honestly think that there is too much hate against muslims , the politicians ride it and here on r/europe you can see the fruit of this campaign . 
  touch\u00e8 , he was probably just nut . 
  i like how people were ready to believe that the nice attacker was an islamist , even before anyone had said such a thing , while now are sceptic to believe that this time the terrorist is a right winger , even if the police say so . 
   if you dont think that aircraft bombing produce mass killings then i have some bad new for you boy . 
  france has over 100 air raids the past years in these countries ( mainly iraq , lybia , raqqa , syria ) turkey is bombing both [ syria ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/24/turkish-jets-carry-out-strikes-against-isis-in-syria-reports ) and [ iraq ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/turkey-extends-bombing-campaign-pkk-targets-iraq-isil-150724212302167.html ) , so following your logic turkey is making mass killings in foreign nations as well . 
  also , i asked you sources , not assumptions . 
  they have been doing raids long before the `` fight against terrorism '' began . 
  are you referring to the 2011 bombing ? 
  it was n't so long ago , to be honest , but i agree that it was a bad idea . 
   and for sure the primary purpose of them being there now is not to fight terrorism again , what 's your sources ? 
  these are mine : [ 1 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/24/isis-behead-11-police-officers-in-fighting-in-libya ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-france-iduskcn0vx1c3 ), 
   france is doing invades and mass killing of civilians in middle east and africa all the time can you provide some sources of these mass killings ? 
   im generally against terrorism but when i see news about french soldiers brutalizing foreign nations again , i can understand the terrorists a bit the special forces deployed in libya are there to fight migrant smugglers and isis , so they are actually fighting the terrorists that have delivered so much destruction . 
  you do n't hear every day about french special forces soldiers dying while on mission , nor about those of other eu countries . 
  that 's why the news has been reported . 
  who knows ? 
  it will certainly take sometime for the u.s. administration to verify what happened during the coup and in the meanwhile people will have probably forgotten the request of extradiction . 
  edit : typo, 
   erdogan on saturday challenged president barack obama directly to extradite fethullah gulen , an islamic preacher who lives in exile in rural pennsylvania , saying the u.s. needs to do what is necessary `` if we are truly strategic partners . '' erdogan , the master of diplomacy . 
  it 's a bad sub for posting this , people have already decided that he was an islamist , even if investigations are still underway . 
  you made me laugh a lot . 
  however , f.s. 
  it 's actually one of the few italian companies that have fared well in these years after a change of governance and privatizations . 
  that makes sense , thank you !, 
   the original deal was for 300m but it was `` offencively low '' and got turned down . 
  who did the offer ? 
  the frenches ? 
  the italians ? 
  and how long ago ? 
  it does n't at all . 
  it 's a two months old news ... 
  obviously no . 
  but as the prince is still saying bullshit like he still considers himself as the king of italy , then he should n't be allowed to come here as he is a potential threat to republican state . 
  also , i just would like his father to be punished for the crimes he has actually committed . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_on_rome please , inform yourself next time . 
  people who wrote the italian constitution were often imprisoned under the fascist regime , that took power thanks to the king , who did n't approve the use of the army against the fascist party and instead proclaimed mussolini prime minister . 
  so i guess you would n't want any king on your homeland soil he caused you so much pain . 
  i agree with you , i hope it will be a disputed match , well played by both sides and without anything to complain later . 
  i wish you good luck too . 
  ps : nice video , 
  i ca n't believe we 're going to play against again . 
  good luck to you too , 
  italy - the second turn of the mayoral elections [ has been held last sunday ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-vote-mayors-iduskcn0z40tu ) and the result was the defeat of the ruling party ( pd ) in two major cities ( rome and turin ) . 
  the five stars movement has won in those cities with virginia raggi ( in the capital city ) and chiara appendino ( in turin ) . 
  this was considered a big setback for pm matteo renzi . 
  - [ a camorra crackdown ] ( http://www.italianinsider.it/?q=node/3966 ) occurred last monday in naples , during which 90 persons related to the d'amico clan were arrested .
