i did n't say that the colonial race took place in the xvii century , tho . 
  context is everything . 
  that happened in the xx century , not the xvii and not during the colonial race . 
  ethiopia was also a recognized member of the league of nations , that was an unjustified war against a sovereign state , just like germany and ussr invading poland . 
  luckily not all the italians are that brainwashed , still italian communists like putin ( sigh ) because he 's anti-nato and italian neofascists like him because he 's a badass anti-muslims/immigrants . 
  i 'm between two fires :(, 
  welp i hear that all the time : `` the only mistake mussolini made was join the ww2 '' . 
  sure , let 's put aside what he made in ethiopia , the anti-jew laws , all the censorships and imprisonments etc. . . 
  lol actually renzi is hated by actual communists , who think they 're still living in the 70s . 
  italy occupied provence ( and later , corsica ), 
  and make him a martyr ? 
  no , thanks . 
  do you have any idea how far are those islands from australia ? 
  while lampedusa is geographically in africa, 
  i do n't know , but if you go with literal fascists and support them , then expect to be called a fascist . 
  exactly . 
  fascists telling themselves that they are poor victims and the eu is the only one to blame for their miserable lives . 
  edit : [ inb4 they 're not fascists !!, 
  itt : lots of people who do n't know shit about punk music . 
  they 're very good , but everyone here 's shitting on them because they 're disabled lol . 
  finally we have a song that it 's not just another shitty electro-pop piece at eurovision ... 
  `` several '' = 2 `` planning terror attack in the us '' = fighting a us funded group in somalia . 
  what is title editorialising ? 
  and of course this was xposted from r/european and r/coontown, 
  i think it 's the opposite for us , kinda weird i did n't expect that . 
  funny because that was the whole point of lega nord when it was founded in the 90s `` the southerners are stealing our jobs !!!, 
  '' , but now they know that they can fish more votes replacing southerners with africans and arabs . 
  uh you 're right , i misunderstood what he meant . 
  point somewhat stands anyway ... pinochet killed all those people , democracy in itself was n't at fault for that . 
  yeah look at the history of chile ... 
   if you are from north italy and you dislike southern italians because their customs are a bit different are you racist/xenophobic ? 
  yes , because you 're thinking of southeners as members of another group ( even another ethnic group ) . 
   people do n't view muslims as a race , you do . 
  lol , no . 
   muslims from india will be seen totally different than muslims from saudi arabia , and you should know that . 
  ** i ** know that . 
  i think that might be a bot, 
   racism does n't apply to islam since muslims are n't an ethnicity . 
  but people ** view ** it as a race , it does n't matter what it actually is . 
  they view it as something * different * and they 're scare of it . 
  so it 's either racism or xenophobia . 
   ca n't be racist since muslim is n't a race or ethnicity . 
  oh c'mon , we all know what they mean : in racists eyes , mosques = muslims = arabs/africans . 
  nobody seems to have issues with muslim albanians or bosniaks travelling throughout europe . 
  vote manipulation is against reddit rules and i 'm pretty sure that nazi scums from / pol / , european , stormfront or whatever brigaded this thread , as they brigade every thread about immigration and asylum seekers since they got nothing better to do than flooding reddit with their racism . 
  i 'm happy that real people in real life are different . 
  it 's just straight up fearmongering right wing propaganda , i 'm speechless . 
  i mean , how could a person older than 14 years old buy all the crap that 's being spouted in this thread ? 
  wtf, 
  is / r/european leaking or wtf is goin on this thread ? 
  again , jail is not for sadistic satisfaction in punishing the criminals . 
  that just does n't work , both in preventing crimes and rehabilitating the criminals . 
  lol i always thought that was a myth, 
  he 's seen as such by right wingers , tho . 
  ( at least the ones i know ), 
  d'annunzio here is still celebrated as a hero and a genius , but i always thought that he was a psycopath, 
  i said `` without fascism '' , not `` without fascists '' . 
  i 'd say salvini is more scary and dangerous than alessandra mussolini , she 's not relevant at all, 
   clearly yeah sure , whatever, 
  itt : people who knows better about migrations than un migration experts, 
  [ there you go ] ( http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/starcraft-2/446041-naniwa-forfeits-mid-series-at-iem-katowice ), 
  nothing in particular , i was just jerking . 
  ( unless you also missed the iem world championship 2014 ), 
  this is our first government that cares about palestine ... 
  uptlo for clarity, 
  you should apologize for naniwa, 
  they are the ones that deny that genocide , not the ones that did it . 
  i think that was sarcasm , or at least i hope it was . 
  it was in bad taste anyway , brah, 
  i think fph is a shitty sub and i 'm 60 kilos , so wot, 
  i think it 's just a / r/fatpeoplehate circlejerk, 
   it 's to deter others . 
  is it working ? 
  japan has the highest suicide rate in the world, 
   where they in the building illegally at least ? 
  nope . 
  notice that we do n't have a serious law against torture , so the police could do anything they wanted . 
  the parliament now will be finally forced to vote for a law against torture , you will not be surprised to find that lega nord is against it . 
  also , if you 're interested and can understand italian , check out this thread : http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/31uy80/ero_alla_scuola_diaz_di_genova_la_notte_del_21/, 
  does it matter that i post on srs ? 
  and you made an account just to point that out , how brave, 
  i just read about it on repubblica , it seems that two people died , the judge and a witness . 
  this sucks . 
  edit a third person is dead : /, 
  so was it her decision to not send enough supplies to the soldiers ? 
  got a source for that ? 
  how is this related to feminism ? 
  i mean , they 're not receiving food because of the feminists ? 
  also , being a feminist has anything to do with the decision to send the troops to iraq ? 
  also , this is hilarious : `` feminist minister says saudi arabia sucks '' / r/europe : `` how does it matter that she 's a feminist !?!? '', 
  `` swedish minister says they 're sending troops to iraq to fight isis '' / r/europe : `` wtf evil feminazis '' lmao, 
  how are those two things related ?
