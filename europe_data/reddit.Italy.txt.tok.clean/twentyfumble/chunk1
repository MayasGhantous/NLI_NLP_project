i imagine they were all giggling and sharing memories about letting merkel wait . 
  then silvio told the story of when he called merkel an `` unfuckable larde-arse '' and putin called it a day and went back to russia with his jet . 
  [ well done vlad ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fh8wuxrwuj8/swvvtkd8kzi/aaaaaaaaboo/jqhatou7-1i/s1600/berlusconi+putin.jpg ), 
  civil unions bill has been presented in parliament and * should * be approved in the next months . 
  students are not counted as unemployed, 
  new jersey ? 
  [ yeah right ] ( http://www.seriouseats.com/images/rawherringsammich.jpg ), 
  croatia , greece , france, 
  according to wikipedia she has been in politics for more than 15 years and specifically at the office for foreign relations since 2003 , worked with the american democrats and on the iraq and afghanistan crises . 
  i do n't know much about her but i would n't say that she has zero experience . 
  many of those boats , when they are rescued , are in danger of sinking and are full of people who are starving and in need of medical attention . 
  so you have to save them for drowning , take them to a facility where they can eat/drink/rest and have emergency medical care . 
  then you need to id them ( not easy , most of them do n't have any papers ) . 
  then you have to sort out all the requests for diplomatic asylum . 
  doing this currently costs around 120m euro per year , only in italy . 
  if you add greece , france and spain the total is probably more than 300m euro , only for rescuing them . 
  frontex current budget is 55m . 
   hungary had one of the worst recessions in the eu with gdp falling something like 7 % in one year ( as bad as any of the pigs countries except greece ) the same can be said of [ every european country ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:dnk:deu:gbr:swe&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=1124316000000&amp;tend=1376776800000&amp;hl=it&amp;dl=it&amp;ind=false ) . 
  2009 was a bad year for everyone . 
  my attempt at 7 ( slightly ) less famous wonders of italy : 1 . 
  [ valle dei templi ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/valle_dei_templi_3214.jpg ) ( agrigento ) 3 . 
  [ san giovanni in laterano ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/lazio_roma_sgiovanni1_tango7174.jpg ) ( rome ) 4 . 
  [ vernazza ] ( http://www.domustrend.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vernazza-italy.jpg ) 5 . 
  [ san gimignano ] ( http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/7c/13/bc/vista-panoramica.jpg ) 6 . 
  [ mole antonelliana ] ( http://www.ilovetorino.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mole_antonelliana.jpg ) ( turin ) 7 . 
  what is this fog you speak of, 
  i am also surprised by italy 's low number , i do n't have an explanation for it, 
  just look at a map , russia has projection power from warsaw to beijing . . 
  it feels good to see berlusconi fall into irrelevance . 
   not all italian have 56k  adsl coverage is [ 96 % ] ( http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/copertura_adsl_in_italia ) , very few people still have 56k . 
  the problem is that only 60 % of the adsl lines are 20mbit or more and a good 10 % of the adsl lines are 2mbit . 
  75 $ per month ? 
  i do n't believe you , it 's impossible to pay that much . 
  even if for some reason you decide to go with telecom italia , their rates are [ much much lower ] ( http://www.telecomitalia.it/internet/adsl-telefono/internet-senza-limiti ) . 
  italian unemployment [ by region ] ( http://economia.panorama.it/lavoro/disoccupazione-2013-regione ) : - north-east : 7,2 % - north-west : 8,8 % - center : 10,3 % - south : 17,9 %, 
  too late . 
  the leaders of the porta nuova mafia [ have been arrested ] ( http://www.gds.it/gds/edizioni-locali/palermo/dettaglio/articolo/gdsid/338282/ ) two days ago, 
  zero , this article is fiction . 
  no one is bothered by that , except for the director of the museum in florence , who said that any commercial exploitation of any piece of art that is in custody of the museum needs their approval . 
  so it 's just copyright stuff or something like that , i assure you no one in italy is `` in arms '' or `` outraged '' . 
  i do n't know why this thread has turned into uk vs italy . 
  anyway since the end of the monarchy we had 17 democratic elections in 66 years . 
  so on average we have elections every 3,8 years . 
  that `` unlike italy '' remark is not justified i think . 
  we also had [ 16 public voting sessions ] ( http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/consultazioni_referendarie_in_italia ) on many importants topics like divorce , privatization , monarchy/republic , health issues , ecc, 
  i do n't know but it 's a new thing, 
  4 of the 18 ministers are under-40 and 9 are women, 
  april to june is a great time for visiting . 
  if you like hiking and nature i suggest the alps ( the swiss and italian parts have the most beautiful locations in my opinion ) . 
   allowed as many tries as they want no . 
  we have first trial ( `` primo grado '' ) , then the losing side can request a second trial with a different judge ( `` secondo grado '' ) and finally you can take the case to the supreme court ( `` terzo grado '' ) . 
  that 's it . 
   the euro area 's official unemployment rate includes only those who actively sought work in the previous four weeks and are available to start within the next two weeks not true , eurostat unemployment rate is based on [ workforce ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/glossary:labour_force ) : includes both employed and unemployed people , but not the economically inactive such as pre-school children , school children , students and pensioners . 
  the vatican . 
  but we will get there , civil unions are in the political program of 2 of the 3 major parties . 
  welcome to rome : [ pic1 ] ( http://de.wallpaperswiki.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/rome-skyline.jpg ) , [ pic2 ] ( http://static.guide.supereva.it/guide/roma/lungotevere-ed-il-suo-fiume/quandoiltevereaccendelacittdipoesia.jpg ) , [ pic3 ] ( http://good-wallpapers.com/pictures/4671/piazza%20san%20pietro%20saint%20peter%20square,%20vatican%20city,%20rome,%20italy%20.jpg ), 
  why is that crazy ? 
  bush got 50 % of the votes . 
  berlusconi owns half of the tv networks in italy , he has a huge lot of money , a great pr team behind his every move , he always promises tax breaks , he 's very good in front of the camera . 
  it 's not that difficult to convince the uneducated to vote for you with such tools at your disposal . 
  many people vote for the party , not for the man . 
  it 's impossible for the right party to fall below 20 % really , regardless of who 's the current leader . 
  but even right-wing voters are deserting him . 
  to give you some perspective , in the 2013 elections berlusconi got 10 million votes . 
  he had 18 million votes in the previous elections , he lost almost 50 % of his voters in the last 4 years . 
  come on senate , do something useful for a change, 
  he gets the votes of the very wealthy ( because he promises tax breaks ) and the uneducated ( brainwashed by his televisions ) . 
  it 's not weird or uncommon , bad people get elected all the time . 
  the us elected george w bush twice . 
  royal family did n't do that well either . 
  maybe we could try with caesars again , that was successful i am told . 
  why does n't he die already . 
  - bjork - ccp/eveonline - that volcano with unpronounceable name that erupted few years ago that 's it i think :-(, 
  fischer is great and it comes in an awesome bottle . 
  yup . 
  and after they pumped out all the fuel , titan salvage came in and got the contract to tilt the ship and got all the news coverage . 
  that 's why boskalis is butt-hurt , 
   a man of boskalis claimed their company would have done it for 250 to 300 million euros instead of the estimated 1.1 billion it 's going to cost now it 's the same estimate that titan salvage ( the company who 's doing the job ) did . 
   he basically blamed corruption ( `` the italian factor '' as he called it ) suggesting the local politicians preferred the method currently used the project is mostly paid by insurance companies and it involves american , dutch and italian private companies . 
  it seems to me that boskalis is just butt-hurt that they were not chosen . 
  finally tourists across all europe will be able to browse facebook all day . 
   the world happiness report ranks countries based on six key factors : gdp per capita , healthy life expectancy , someone to count on , perceived freedom , freedom from corruption , generosity . 
  lol, 
  * berlusconi threatens the country as usual * weather is great and italy is beautiful , cities are empty except for tourists * economy still bad but not getting worse at least * we have 4 new senators , and it looks like they are decent people ( nobel prizes and stuff like that ), 
  in 2-3 years all europeans will be able to use their subscription plan in roaming while abroad . 
  finally the tourists who come to rome will be able to browse facebook while standing in line waiting to visit the colosseum , 
  three italy had this for long time , i went on vacation in the uk 3 years ago and i could use my subscription plan there . 
  in order to connect to the 3g network i had to change the apn manually on my phone i think , but that 's it . 
  the bad news was that three uk had very little coverage in devon and cornwall . 
  bad guys never die . 
   because they voted for him this is not even true , people are not voting for him anymore . 
  in the last 2013 elections he only received 10 million votes , a steep decline from the 18 million votes of 2008 and the 20 million votes of 2005 . 
  poor vending machines builders, 
  because he 's the president of his party ( pdl ) the party has : - 1 president - 1 secretary - 3 coordinators source : http://www.ilpopolodellaliberta.it/notizie/arc_15381.htm, 
  it 's the diet , every time i go to england or sweden i gain weight . 
  i guess the food is more caloric and has more fat to compensate for the cold temperature ? 
  til to smoke in uk you must be rich, 
  i am not following this trial much , i have been listening to this shit for 20 years now and i am really tired of it , i have lost any interest in berlusconi and his problems with justice . 
  so i really ca n't comment about the lack of evidence but i think what you say is plausible , the justice system has become obsessed with the man after what he did . 
  this trial is like al capone being convicted for tax fraud .
