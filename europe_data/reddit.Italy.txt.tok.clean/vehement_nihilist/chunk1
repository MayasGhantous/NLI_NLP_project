so many posts and not * one * picture ... 
  as a vegetarian , if i asked everybody at the table not to eat meat , they would get angry . 
  and they would be right . 
  i laughed ( while holding a nice glass of red wine ) . 
  because it 's true . 
  i really hope - <  - becomes as popular as / s or ? 
  in 10 years a dialogue like this may or may not be considered ordinary : a : so , honey , what are we doing for christmas ? 
  - <  - a : oh , come on !, 
  stop merkeling around . 
  today is the 23rd !, 
  dick is like `` mhmmm good soup , good soup . 
  nom nom nom '' . 
  it makes sense . 
  i would assume it means between each other . 
  noooooo !, 
  you guys beat us again !, 
  ( pun intended ) . 
  now we 'll have to go to mars and draw a european vagina next to that american penis . 
  it 's a noble purpose , is n't it ? 
  go to mars .

  profit , europe , profit !!, 
  and we could see our sister moon io in all its beauty , volcanoes and all !, 
  they have very little to lose + religion ( as opposed to logic ) . 
  i stumbled upon [ this billboard on wikipedia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/don%27t_abuse_children_sign_in_south_africa.jpeg ) that left me speechless . 
  at least we got a catchy song about that experience . 
  yes , because the last time a wall was built in europe , it went incredibly well . 
  love the url `` fatwoman_3267110b . jpg '', 
  [ here 's the perfect music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2wh8mhjnhm ) to match the photos . 
  now you can get the full experience when you look at that rusty and moldy staircase . 
  alcohol : real life photoshop . 
  you have extremely cute-sounding words . 
  even insults like `` imb\u00e9cile '' sound almost like a compliment . 
  one my favourite words in french is `` choisissez '' . 
  hell , i would name a litter of kittens after the whole imparfait conjunction of `` choisir '' !, 
  that being said , to me , written and spoken french are two different things : the silent vowels , the silent consonants , the accents , it 's hard . 
  damn latin . 
  sorry for invading you , lol . 
  having 200ml of wine 3 times a day during a meal does n't have the same effects as drinking 600ml of wine on an empty stomach in a single setting . 
  / late to the party but whatever . 
  sometimes i do this too .

  good thing the romans gave them [ bath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bath,_somerset ) , imagine if they did n't !, 
  good thing that you set up a system to make tea [ inside the tanks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boiling_vessel ) !, 
  optimise the efficiency of tea breaks !, 
  such idiots for booing the anthem , and an amazing one too . 
  i love singing it . 
   maybe that actually is what you mean ? 
   yes . 
   the ultimate goal was a world dominated by `` aryans '' . 
  that 's my opinion too . 
  to expand on why i say the war was a pretext ( maybe it 's not even the right word ) , it 's because the nazi clearly needed to mobilitate the army and win the masses ' consensus in order to achieve their goals of ethnic cleansing . 
  if they did n't blame the jews , the war reparations imposed by the french , and the lost territories , for the horrendous state of the economy at the time , i doubt the german populace would have brainwashed to that level . 
  by inciting the masses against these ` enemies ' , they exploited their consensus and used them accordingly . 
  the old prussian culture played a major role in that context , and the nazis exploited that as well . 
  the psychological impact of that kind of propaganda was simply immense : the people felt like they could do something for their country , be part of the plan to fix the economy , to fight the common enemies ( foreigners ) and regain territories and resources and heal the wounded prussian pride , from the loss of wwi . 
  without the war and the chaos of it , i ca n't imagine how their plans would have worked . 
  what could they do ? 
  tell the troops to get every single jew in germany and kill them ? 
  those very people who were their shop assistants , neighbours , in-laws ? 
  the motivation would n't have been strong enough . 
  making the enemy a stranger , a foreigner , was necessary for the first stage of their insane plans . 
  these are personal opinions , of course , but i recently had a pretty in-depth conversation on / r/italy on the topic , and it made me think quite a bit on this aspect . 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  in my opinion the war was a pretext created by the top nazis to kill as many undesirable civilians as possible . 
  in this sense , one could say they won . 
  not to say that genocide was new thing , but it had never been applied to that scale , and most importantly , at the expense of the military actions . 
  this is why i think it 's a war led by very unconventional motives . 
  war reparations have always existed , it certainly was n't an invention of the french . 
  that said , you do n't ask them 50 + years after the fact , when the country is n't made of rubble anymore . 
  it really depends on your goal . 
  wasting that many resources on such a large scale in order to kill civilians does n't exactly scream `` i want to win the war '' , at least not in a conventional way . 
  aww !, 
  keep being strong , brothers . 
  remember when we both ruled the world ? 
  cheers to that and to the future !, 
  you said it was fun . 
  :( disappointed . 
  hell , we had ultras throwing bananas at mario balotelli . 
  hands down , you win . 
  why the hell , all this hate for brits on this sub ? 
  just to give you an idea as to why it happens , please refer to [ my comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zamsc/earthquake_strikes_central_italy/d6ufr0r ) . 
  of course , on top of that there is lack of funding and many old buildings ( probably ancient for americans ) . 
  the point still stands though : the school in amatrice crumbled down and it was built 3 years ago . 
  it was officially earthquake-proof . 
  i was reading about optimism bias in relation to disasters and mentioned that the people who plan to avoid them would need to work with philosophers , so greece , thanks for that . 
  and democracy . 
  and feta . 
  thank you greece !, 
  although there 's no need for more rescuers , we deeply appreciate the sentiment !, 
   malakas thanks , now because of this word i 'm on a wikipedia spree , currently reading about `` homosexuality in ancient greece '' . 
  thanks lagarde !, 
  63 now, 
  you 're right , building codes are ok . to make your house earthquake-proof is simply not a priority for your average italian , except those who have a phobia or suffered the consequences of a real earthquake . 
  plus , corruption of course . 
  check my other comment for more details . 
  one can hope , but ... http://lacittadisalerno.gelocal.it/salerno/cronaca/2015/04/05/news/sfollati-35-anni-dopo-il-terremoto-vivere-tra-i-container-di-cava-1.11178127, 
  it 's mostly because of the buildings . 
  because not everybody wants to live in a city ?
