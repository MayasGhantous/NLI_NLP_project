  corruption is a major issue . 
  there are many anti seismic regulations for new buildings but sometimes contractors use sub-par materials to cut costs while pocketing the money . 
  at the same time , some people 's mentality is roughly `` why would i want to spend money , renovate my house or move 2km over something that may not happen or has a tiny chance of happening in my lifetime ? '' . 
  the same philosophy applies for those idiots who illegally build houses on mount vesuvius ( the volcano , yes ! ) . 
  it must be mentioned that if one wants to renovate and secure their ( presumably old ) house with antiseismic criteria , the government offers tax breaks and partial reimbursements , same thing for renewable energy like solar panels . 
  some people see it as an expense instead of an investment . 
  edit : case in point . 
  a 6.0 earthquake strikes the town , the only collapsed building [ is the elementary school ] ( http://www.ilgiornaledelmolise.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/crollo_sangiuliano.jpg ) , that had just been renovated and `` secured '' . 
  26 children and 1 teacher died . 
  after a lengthy trial , in 2010 , the engineers and the contractor , alongside with the local authorities , were found guilty and sentenced to prison . 
  edit : reddit , you 're fickle . 
  from +6 to +1 to +4 to 0 . 
  you really think that this mentality and corruption are not the reasons why a 5.5 earthquake is a major concern in italy , while it 's not elsewhere ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.emiliaromagnameteo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4843223_orig.jpg ) is what happened to a visibly new house in 2012 after a 5.8 earthquake in emilia . 
  it 's not just old rural buildings that crumble down . 
  anti-rape female condoms actually exist , but dear god , it 's sad that there 's demand for them . 
  monologue bracelets ? 
  wow , some of those are less utopistic than the versions i 'm used to . 
  the romanian one '' ... and they lived happily until old age . '', 
  makes me think of an old fairytale prince in a nursing home saying `` after the third heart attack i 'm not * that * happy '' . 
  interesting stuff . 
  is it for real ? 
  talk about a nice dose of realism . 
  wtf ? 
  so anything involving the number 88 must be banned because it 's racist ? 
  how widespread is this use of 88 ? 
  i did n't know about this . 
  because your cars are like your cell phones : they 're indestructible . 
  i have a nokia 3310 somewhere and i 'm sure that thing would still work with a new battery . 
  lol . 
  i 'm rooting for iceland against france . 
  what 's not to love about them ? 
  it 's an underdog dream . 
  do n't they have a part-time dentist as a coach ? 
  buffon is crying on tv right now ; ___ ; what an engaging and dramatic match , even for someone like me who does n't follow football . 
  congrats germany at least it was entertaining losing like that . 
  whoa !, 
  are we capitalising nouns already ? 
  / r/europe ist scheller than europe . 
  it 's basically our holiday home anyway . 
  he left his flair on the moon , duh !, 
  if anything , this mess will offer a lot of food for thought in regard to democracy and its responsabilies . 
  not to mention , many people across the globe , including some leavers , soon realised that some politicians started campaigns only to advance their careers , dragging their country with them . 
  it may help change perspective on many important issues . 
  do n't pay too much attention to the echo chamber though , we 're truly sad for the remainers . 
  i 'm saving the good wine for the event . 
  i read it in karl pilkington 's voice .

  romanticism is not dead , after all . 
  those sexy keynesian monetary policies ...

  awww , you , and your lovely pagan festivities !, 
  meanwhile , here i am , boiling alive . 
   __  look at that fresh , soft grass and the cool water in the lake !, 
  i can almost feel a breeze .

  happy midsummer festival , finland !, 
  [ look at her !, 
  we 'll miss you :(, 
  time to learn to spell color instead of colour . 
  very wise , actually . 
  you 've got a dragon in your flag : you 'll never die . 
  nope . 
  ca n't do it . 
   it 's also somewhat surprising that italy unified and has been so stable . 
  lol . 
  glorious flying tank , hi !, 
  underrated comment . 
  this needs / r/askhistorians or / r/askanthropology i have a feeling religion plays a role in that . 
  we built some roads there and not much more . 
  oh , and we have a [ mildly racist yet catchy song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmcjd6_dwfe ) about the whole ordeal . 
  that 's about it . 
  italy ca n't into empire . 
  indeed . 
  you 've got to love catholicism . 
  yay !, 
  so metal . 
  welcome to italy !, 
  your math is right . 
  the number may seem small but really , it 's not . 
  for instance , [ today , the national average ] ( http://www.prezzibenzina.it ) is 1.494 / lt and you can effectively say it 's almost 1/4th of taxes . 
  the surreal part is that those taxes should finance situations that no longer exist . 
  back in 2013 the prices [ skyrocketed to over 2 $ / lt ] ( http://www.motori.it/immagini/attualita/2013/carburanti-prezzo-benzina-oltre-2-euro-al-litro/016550_big.jpg ) , by the way . 
  i did n't know that . 
  thanks . 
  fixed . 
  ok , these ones are not valid anymore but they were repealed only in ** 1981 ** . 
  ** honor killing ( only valid for men ) ** similar to other southern/mediterranean european areas , `` honor '' was traditionally important in italy . 
  indeed , until 1981 , the criminal code provided for mitigating circumstances for such killings ; until 1981 the law read : art . 
  587 : he who causes the death of a spouse , daughter , or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the offence to his honour or that of his family will be sentenced to three to seven years . 
  the same sentence shall apply to whom , in the above circumstances , causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse , daughter , or sister . 
  [ 113 ] [ 114 ] traditionally , honor crimes used to be more prevalent in southern italy . 
  [ 88 ] [ 115 ] ( via wiki ) ** rehabilitating marriage ** if a woman is raped and the rapist offers to marry her and she accepts , the rape crime is extinguished . 
  if she does n't accept the proposal , he 'll be prosecuted but she 'll be ostracised by society . 
  a good story about this is [ franca viola 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franca_viola ) . 
  for every single litre of petrol . 
  like granade balloons ? 
  we still pay these excise taxes on all types of petrol/gas/diesel whatever in order to fund : * drumroll * $ 0,000981 : ethiopian war 1935-1936 ; $ 0,00723 : suez crisis 1956 ; $ 0,00516 : reconstruction for the vajont dam disaster 1963 ; $ 0,00516 : reconstruction for the florence flooding 1966 ; $ 0,00516 : recontruction for the earthquake in belice ( sicily ) 1968 ; $ 0,0511 : recontruction for the earthquake in friuli 1976 ; $ 0,0387 recontruction for the earthquake in irpinia 1980 ; $ 0,106 : war in lebanon 1983 ; $ 0,0114 : war mission in bosnia 1996 ; $ 0,02 : contract renewal of train and bus drivers 2004 ; $ 0,005 : purchase of green-eco buses 2005 ; $ 0,0051 : reconstruction for the l'aquila earthquake 2009 ; $ 0,0073 : maintenence and conservation of cultural sites and institutions 2011 ; $ 0,04 : accomodation for libian immigrants 2011 ; $ 0,0089 : flooding of liguria and tuscany november 2011 ; $ 0,082 ( $ 0,113 sul diesel ) : `` salva italia '' decree ( austerity euro stuff ) ; $ 0,02 : reconstrution for the earthquake in emilia 2012 [ source ] ( http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/petizione-contro-accise-obsolete-stanco-pagare-guerra-detiop-1213028.html ) now i want a round of applause from the germans because translating this stuff on mobile is booooring and it 's against my laziness  __  edit : fixed a mistake .
