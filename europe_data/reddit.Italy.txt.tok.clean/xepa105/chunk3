  there 's just as much harm done by richer tourists that spend only on a small number of already elite establishments , or what i call `` scared tourists '' , those who only want to eat and spend on things they know ( like eating at mcdonald 's or shopping at carrefour ) . 
  there 's a reason why when you go to the info centres of a tourist-dependent city there 's so much information for backpackers ; those cities know the value of these kind of tourists . 
  both kinds of tourism have their positives and negatives , but to say that just because they have less money overall , that backpackers are `` leeches '' is extremely shortsighted . 
  backpacking is crucial for small and medium businesses that employ thousands of people in various european cities , moreover it is a great way for seeing different places and cultures while keeping your costs down , and considering the situation of youth employment in europe at the moment , you 're against that !? 
  so the only people who should travel are the comfortably rich , who stay in 3 + star hotels and rent cars and dine in michelin-grade restaurants ? 
  these `` leeches '' you complain about are the ones that keep little kebab stands , and small souvenir shops , and independent hostels running , all while seeing different places and meeting different people at an age where these kind of interactions help shape their understanding of people from all over . 
  getting rid of these `` leeches '' would destroy the already fragile economies of a lot of european cities . 
  the amount of people who make a living in munich , or paris , or milan , etc. 
  by catering to young people travelling on a shoestring budget is significant enough that whenever tourism drops in one of those cities the whole city feels , cause suddenly a lot of people who were making money off of tourism have less of it , spend less of it on their local shops , and those local shops now have less money , and the cycle continues and affects everyone . 
  what you want then , is for young people to remain in their countries , not exposed to people form other places , not visiting and taking in different sights and cultures , basically enclosed in your own little bubble , up until the moment that have enough money to not be a `` filthy backpacker '' , at which point , what are they really travelling for anymore . 
  at the same time wanting for small businesses in tourist areas to suffer because not as many young people with small budgets are traveling anymore , and god knows most 35 + - year-old people who are travelling with family and staying in hotels do n't eat in out-of-the-way kebab shops or stay in hostels . 
  there 's a reason why tourist cities encourage and desire backpackers , it 's because they know that as a whole , they impact and benefit more of their businesses than the comfortably rich , who would rather stay in large chain hotels , eat in large established restaurants , and drive cars to see sights rather than take transit or walk . 
  venice from may to august is n't a city , it 's a theme park for foreign tourists , like disneyland . 
  everything is geared towards tourists , the city is so small that there is nowhere you can go too get away from the touristy areas . 
  everywhere is the touristy area . 
  even in other tourist-trap cities in italy like florence and rome , you can go to some out-of-the-way neighborhoods to feel a little less swamped by the tourists , appreciate a little bit of the city beyond the tourist areas ; not so in venice . 
  very well said . 
  every other european country is saying ` italy should be doing more ! ', 
  but then when italian government asks for help , everyone says ` not our problem . ', 
  the country is operating on a shoestring budget on this issue as is , while taking the brunt of the migrants * and * doing it with little outside help ( fucking libya is doing way more than any other european country ) . 
  and people have the balls to blame italy or say that italy should be doing more , while not lifting a single finger . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  it 's supposed to be an european * union * , but in cases like this it 's every country for themselves .

  exactly . 
  and yet no one talks about how those guys also do n't fit into our society because `` they look like us . '', 
  italians were suppressed , and the country was a lot more divided during the second world war than most people give it credit . 
  mussolini got into power not through a quasi-democratic manner like hitler did , instead he was installed through a coup , without that much popular support outside of the military and industrialists , and as soon as he got into power he ruthlessly smashed any dissent or political opposition . 
  and you got ta remember that he also did so much earlier than hitler , he took power in 1922 , so that he had a lot of time to put his grip on the country , and dissent was harshly suppressed . 
  i am not going to make comparisons to the soviet treatment of ukraine , cause it 's not comparable , but italians did n't all have it great under the fascists . 
  that 's not to say there were n't millions who supported him after he got into power , there were , after all he did improve the economy and the infrastructure of the country , so that italy was a in a very good economic situation on the eve of ww2 . 
  but that very economic improvement was why war itself was never that popular with the italian people , partly because there were no great victories to cheer on , and partly because it was seen as ` the german war ' that italians got dragged into because mussolini wanted to buddy up to hitler . 
  the discontent was much more acute than in almost any other pro-axis country . 
  by 1943 there were massive labour strikes and resistance movements gathered strength , enough to cause a country-wide civil war as soon as mussolini was deposed and the germans invaded . 
  while you 're right , i 'm gon na go out on a limb and say that most people who hate soros and blame him for all kinds of stuff , have never heard/read anything he 's said . 
  i know i have just a few things here and there , and i 'm very much into politics and world affairs . 
  for the average person in america/hungary/wherever , when soros is portrayed as an evil entity , how much about him do they really know , and how much do they just take at face value ? 
  the fact that you can read/hear what soros is putting out there does n't mean most people do , and in that sense soros * is * like goldstein in that he becomes this icon for the state to direct people 's hate and frustrations onto .

  it 's still enough to delegitimize his presidency and hurt his new party 's chances in the upcoming parliamentary elections later this year . 
  if macron has a poor showing in that election it 'll really harm his presidency and his ability to get stuff done .
