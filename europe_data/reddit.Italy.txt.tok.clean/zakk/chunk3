  also berlusconi never said that he would pay back the tax with his own money . 
  also the 80 % figure for his control of televisions is utter crap , and most of the press is controlled by gruppo l'espresso which sides with berlusconi opponents . 
  no , that 's only one city in veneto ... and by the way they started eating cats only during ww2 as last resort during a famine . 
  after the war a long period of economic prosperity followed , and they never ate cats anymore !, 
  in my area of italy ( veneto , in the north-east ) horse meat is widely appreciated and there are plenty of restaurants serving only horse meat . 
  it costs more than beef , on average , and it is more savory !, 
  i would love a lasagna made of horse meat !, 
  all this smells like ethical state ... 
  i do n't want to live in an european union like that !, 
  most constitutions do not allow for a part of the country to secede . 
  so you are technically right , most independence declarations and most revolutions are illegal and no one has any obligation to take any notice . 
  no one was legally forced to take notice that the usa declared independence , or that a king was n't ruling france any longer . 
  nonetheless revolutions do happen , secessions do happen and the international community sooner or later has to take notice . 
  relevant username !, 
  i think the submission is interesting . 
  given all the debate about the european union , analyzing how the eu is promoting its image to citizens it 's very interesting in my opinion . 
  please leave this submission . 
  thank you !, 
  it looked so absurd i though it was from a long time ago !, 
  which year are they from ? 
   everyone should cut spending by 1 % and income by 1 % , this would provide 3 billion euros for the crisis handling . 
  what ? 
  is n't orban the bad guy who hates all immigrants ? 
  / s  refugees should be distributed all around the world , not just in the eu good luck with this !, 
   the brilliant fellow in charge of this operation is the same gentleman who called italy 's first black minister an orangutan . 
  i 'll add a detail i find very funny to your summary of mr. calderoli 's recent political career . 
  a criminal investigation was starting against this `` brilliant fellow '' after he insulted the black minister . 
  actually there were two : for defamation and for incitement to racial hatred . 
  ( the latter can be either a crime by itself or an aggravating circumstance , but it does n't matter here ... ) however in italy a criminal procedure against an mp must be authorized by the parliament itself . 
  guess what ? 
  the procedure for defamation was authorized , but the procedure for incitement to racial hatred was halted . 
  and the votes from the ruling centre-left party have been decisive . 
  one can only speculate how this happened . 
  on a completely unrelated note on the same day mr. calderoli withdrew half a million of amendments on another proposed bill . 
  despite the loud outcry from the ruling centre-left party , this kind of behaviour is , sadly , very common in italian politics . 
  nearly every party used it sooner or later . 
  mr. calderoli has just taken it to the next level . 
  the funny part is that , depending on someone 's political leaning and who 's using this strategy , this behaviour ( obstructionism we call it , i do n't know if it makes sense in english ) may be regarded as an expression of righteousness and democracy or , alternatively , as scandal , made possible by the unacceptable twistedness of the italian parliamentary system . 
  are you for real ? 
  is / r/libertarian a far-right sub ? 
  what about / r/tumblrinaction , / r/mensrights and fatpeoplehate ? 
  for sure , you may or may not like the content of these sub 's , but the bot does not check for far-right content , it checks for an arbitrary list of content someone arbitrarily judged unacceptable or offensive . 
  it 's not about politics , it 's about someone 's fee-feelings . 
  of course i can . 
  but the whole thing has a thought police vibe i do n't like . 
   they have clean posting histories . 
  what makes a posting history clean ? 
  what makes a posting story dirty ? 
  should n't we judge the quality of each comment , rather than the subs they 're posted to ? 
   he likes to throw around the word ` racist ' a lot he just proposed on / r/italy some guidelines for banning racist users ... 
  / u/hjongoldrake would make a ** terrible mod ** in my opinion . 
  as i noted in the other thread ( click [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3j57p8/reurope_is_looking_for_new_moderators_apply_here/cuxzgqs ) to see his answers ) he 's known for his arrogant and unfriendly demeanor and for using blasphemy in / r/italy . 
  just a couple of examples , among hundreds : https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/3hcbfv/che_ne_pensate/cu6805f?context=3 i 'll ( badly ) translate , for the non italian speakers : ** `` your god , who is a pig , should strike you with a lightning for posting these fucking titles '' ** . 
  for context , the title was : `` what do you think about it ? '', 
  ( the translation does n't make a lot of sense , it 'll suffice to say that the kind of blasphemy he uses is perceived by many as one of the most offensive expressions in the italian language . ), 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/3e6zlj/per_sconfiggere_lis_%c3%a8_necessario_fermare_chi_lo/ctc2jax?context=3 translation : ** `` go and spam this bullshit on facebook , anyway , #fuckoff . 
  '' ** ( i took two recent comments , most probably it 's not even the most offensive comments he posted . ), 
  definitely not mod material . 
  you are known for your arrogant and unfriendly demeanor and for using blasphemy in / r/italy .

  i took two comments , most probably they 're not even the most offensive comments you posted . 
  that said , my questions are : 1 ) do you believe that every opinion can be expressed and supported without resorting to offensive language and blasphemy ? 
  are they needed sometimes ? 
  2 ) can you publicly commit to using a decent language , should you be chosen as a moderator of / r/europe , at least when speaking as a moderator ? 
  3 ) are blasphemy and insults intended or the result of a surge of anger ? 
  4 ) a moderator is constantly dealing with spammers and trolls . 
  do you think you can effectively control your rage in those situations ? 
  often in / r/italy you have been trolled into endless , pointless discussions . 
  do n't get me wrong , i enjoy colorful figures of speech , it 's just that i feel like your behavior is too blunt and arrogant to be a decent moderator . 
  you make a good user but a very bad moderator in my humbly opinion . 
  edit : grammar, 
  make it 20 . 
   were abolished in 1992 1995 ( riforma dini ) . 
  ftfy . 
   asking for more flexibility is ok but it does n't mean that you can break the rules . 
  actually flexibility is just a euphemism for breaking the rules , or , at least , negotiating some new rules , which means breaking the old ones . 
  no , you 're not , i can see your comment . 
  i am just reporting what has been said in a major national newspaper ( la stampa ) and by a redditor in / r/italy, 
  usually there are strict security controls at courts in italy , however according to some sources ( la stampa ) the metal detector was out of order this morning . 
  according to a redditor on / r/italy lawyers , plaintiffs and defendants do n't need to go through the security controls . 
  funnily enough , the parts about prostitution and darts received a lot of criticism on / r/italy , not because of the accuracy of the content , but because of the perceived appropriateness of the topics . 
  forza nuova is structured more like a party , casa pound looks like a `` movement '' . 
  i do n't think they support each other openly , however there is a big ideological overlap . 
  you got it right !, 
  the correct name of the italian one is `` forza nuova '' . 
  upvoted for molis n't !, 
  it 's highly unlikely that he will go to jail . 
  his lawyers will surely appeal the sentence , and anyway he may be too old to serve a sentence in jail , so he will probably go to home detention , which means ... more bunga bunga parties , actually !, 
  well , no dude ... trenitalia is 100 % owned by ferrovie dello stato italiane , which in turn is owned 100 % by the state ... 
  it is only a private company only from a formal point of view . 
   it is fair that everyone 's vote counts the same . 
  well , in my opinion , no . 
  how can it be fair a system in which a moron has the same voting rights of a nobel prize winner ? 
  we are not all equal ( that is a myth which dates back to the french revolution ) there are stupid persons and there are then people who run the world . 
   i 'm not that sure that any other electoral system would have resulted in anything dramatically different . 
  i 'm not saying that our electoral system is flawed , i 'm saying that __ democracy __ is flawed . 
  that 's another story and i am going very off-topic , but ...
