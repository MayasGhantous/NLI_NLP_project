[ after surrendering to the allies , italy split up , and the northern half of the country was still under mussolini/german control until 25th of april , 1945 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_social_republic ), 
  in italy , 25th of april is a national holiday ( liberation after ww2 ) , just a week apart from the 1st of may . 
  easter monday is also a holiday , so depending on the exact date of easter , the three may all combine favourably , as it was this year . 
  for instance , if a holiday falls on tuesday or thursday , many businesses and schools tweak their schedule so to take an extra day off ( * ponte * , `` bridge '' ) and have super-long weekends . 
  ( edit : all on german taxpayers ' money / s ) . 
  similarities probably stop there , considering they evolved from [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neac\u0219u%27s_letter ) and [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonio_veneziano_ ( poet \\ ) #no . _ vii ) . 
   i 'm from piedmont and i have lived in lombardy as well , and in my experience southerners use their regional language more but i might be wrong your sample of southerners living in the north may be skewed towards a lower socioeconomic status . 
  my impression is that people from e.g. 
  the northeast see no social stigma associated with their dialect , and people everywhere tend to use it quite liberally when addressing complete strangers . 
  edit : source for usage is wpedia . 
  hey , glad you noticed , 
   in the south regional languages tend to be more used than in the north even assuming this fact ( which is wrong in my experience ) , neapolitan would be the `` top minority language '' anyway ( 6 vs. 5 million native speakers ) . 
  in fact , it is not farther from standard italian than other regional dialects * ( e.g. 
  a number of words come from arab , spanish , french , etc. 
  roots , but the bulk of the lexicon obviously comes from latin . 
  * or regional languages or whatever the linguists call them . 
  although i do n't agree with almost anything you wrote , the amount of downvotes on your comments is appalling - people here probably feel that every b. voter must be a brainwashed madman with no rational motive other than destroying their country . 
  the science going on at these facilities is usually planned at an european level , so the actual geographical position is not that important . 
  it is important for logistics and such . 
   who settled some centuries ago in molise and calabria ( two italian regions ) . 
  also in sicily . 
   whereas prosecco is a product of the latter half of the 20th century . 
  [ in 1754 , we find the word prosecco in the book `` il roccolo ditirambo '' , written by aureliano acanti : ` and now i would like to wet my mouth with that prosecco with its apple bouquet ' . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prosecco#history ) so , not really . 
  letta is now the current democratic party leader after bersani resigned : he mainly represents the christian democrats in the party , more inclined to cooperate with centrists and right-wing parties . 
  he comes from the same left-leaning christian democrat area as prodi . 
  he 's always been quite far from the limelight , and possibly the only one able to find the necessary compromises at this point . 
  pdl secured the control of very high-budget ministries ( health , infrastructure , interior , agriculture ) with key figures who are extremely loyal to b. 
  on the one hand , this means they are going to profit from all this ; on the other hand , compared to what happened with monti ( pdl could back up that govt until a few months ago and then walk away like nothing happened , since they were not poiticians ) , pdl is probably going also to take much more responsibility of what the govt is going to do . 
   btw , is this grillo better for the country than berlusconi , lega nord , or is he just as bad ? 
  right now it 's a container for a wide range of anti-euro/conspiracy/populist ideas , fueled by the present rampant income inequality and general distrust towards the political parties . 
  in some respects it is similar to what lega nord was at the beginning , just without the open regionalist/xenophobe connotations . 
  their slogan was `` roma ladrona '' ( robber rome ) , meaning that lega nord would have cleansed all political corruption in the parliament . 
  eventually they did not , and they soon benefited extensively from the very same system - that 's also why they have survived as a party throughout the years . 
  it is unlikely that grillo 's party is going to have this chance . 
  taken as a party , it moved a few steps forward on b. 
  's footprints towards quite a dangerous path : all in all , b. 
  's party is still composed of established politicians , and whatever display of hostility towards judges or other institutions has been a limited role-play to protect the personal interests of the boss . 
  however unlikely , some nutty in charge who considers banning vaccines , leaving the euro or defaulting on sovereign debt just for a laugh , should worry everybody much more than the most corrupt politician . 
  the families who control directly very large companies ( berlusconi , agnelli , ferrero , barilla ) are arguably the most powerful people in italy . 
  some of them manage to keep their influence and wealth out of the limelight ( e.g. 
  the boroli and drago families , who own de agostini and lottomatica ) . 
  which is ( luckily ) not relevant , if not from a numerical point of view . 
  his movement gained significantly less seats than its vote fraction . 
   we ( / r/austria ) had a christian right/far-right coalition for 10 years , and the amount of corruption has been staggering . 
  but now there 's also a public feeling of `` enough is enough '' , and the corrupt shitheads are now being burnt at the stake . 
  that same public feeling dominates ( part of ) italy since the early 1990s . 
  problem is , a very large part of the population thrives on the very same political/economical system that has been allegedly `` uncovered '' and `` dismantled '' in the early 1990s ( tangentopoli ) . 
  what happened then was that the corruption system ( used by all , and advantageous to all ) became too expensive so all politicians were `` fired '' , and replaced with new ones . 
  this is a slightly personal interpretation . 
  the official story may tell you that a bunch of brave public attorneys uncovered and dismantled the system , the public opinion raged , and everything was clean again . 
  everyone proposes their own causes and cures for all this : libertarians argue this is all caused by the huge influence of the central administration on the economy ; leftists shift the blame from the public servants to their bosses ; people living in the north say it 's because of the mobsters in the south ; people living in the south argue that the north most benefits from corruption ; almost everyone says it 's genetics and we just ca n't behave like the swedes do ; and so on and so forth . 
   does n't that just make you cringe when you think about it ? 
  this man has been blackmailed by so many people and for who knows how long , when he was the pm of an eu and g8 member state . 
  i think this is way more cringe-worthy , and in this context hookers become just details . 
  i think that the analysis of the public impact of b. has been overly prurient , and that focusing on salacious stories and private misdemeanors , so fitting the italian clich\u00e9 abroad , does not help when trying to understand what has been going on in the last two decades . 
  ( i do not think that sleeping with underage people is ok , of course ) . 
  edit : as what concerns changing the laws , bear in mind that corruption is pervasive at all levels in italy , so b. is not the only beneficiary nor the only advocate of such laws . 
  i understand that the idea of an evil mastermind is extremely appealing , but i 'm afraid the problem will not magically disappear with his demise . 
  according to a leading linguist and former education minister , about fifty per cent italian adults have difficulty in understanding texts . 
  if this is true , then browsing a website in a foreign language requires that you belong to a rather small subset of the general population . 
   well , two reasons :   his opponents suck   he has a lot of media power this is has become almost a commonplace in italy . 
  i humbly put forward a third reason : there is a sizable number of citizens who identify themselves with the ideas of the political right , and who would never in their life vote anything vaguely resembling the left . 
  they may not have been happy to vote for b. , but they did , and apparently they will . 
   and seems to have a real shot at winning the upcoming election ? 
  there seems to be a consensus between polls that his party is not going anywhere close to `` winning '' , and that it has in fact been very close to disbanding during the last year . 
  edit : what could be labeled as `` winning '' for his party is that the democratic party fails to reach majority in one or two key regions ( lombardy and sicily ) , thus preventing it to have the majority in the senate , which is assigned on a regional basis . 
   how you can convince your countrymen to give up on this guy once and for all ? 
  you ( meaning everyone outside italy ) should realize that he could be bad , but his agenda and motives were not significantly worse than those of the whole centre-right coalition that backed his government . 
  the astounding amount of conflicting interests he needs to protect is arguably the motive behind his stubbornness as an individual , but i ca n't see how that political area will be significantly different after he 's gone ( * bunga bunga * and other trite details aside ) . 
  2nd panel , # 3 ? 
  it 's `` aumma aumma '' . 
  guess it 's neapolitan dialect , but such a gesture is understood throughout the south . 
  i have no clue on # 8 . 
  something like that was included in the reform promised by that the prodi government in 2006 . 
  anyway , the [ `` rights and duties for stably cohabiting people '' bill ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diritti_e_doveri_delle_persone_stabilmente_conviventi ) ( dico ) never ever came to life after discussion in the parliament , even if it was an already neutered version of the original idea ( akin to french pacs ) . 
  it is interesting , however , that the proposal was put forward by a prominent catholic mep , minister of family at the time . 
  subsequent political transformations , including the de facto exclusion of all leftist parties from the parliament , eventually buried the discussion . 
  the italian surname and the dutch toponym most likely share the same origin ( [ a germanic-longobard word * braida * or * braidaz * --  broad ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:proto-germanic/braidaz ) ) . 
  that 's an incredibly dumb article . 
  it lists the many meat-based delicacies of emilia and then it concludes `` hurr durr , no one must be vegetarian there '' . 
  i ca n't find no better definition of talking out of one 's ass . 
  you could probably list as many meat-based delicacies for any other italian region ( not as refined or as famous as those from emilia , though ) - but what 's best is that [ italy has probably the highest fraction of vegetarians in europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vegetarianism_in_specific_countries#europe ) , and a higher percentage of vegetarians appears in northern and central regions , correlating well with wealth . 
  that 's like the definition of emilia . 
  i would have multiplied everything by 100 , and no decimal digits . 
  actually the people over at r/dataisbeautiful would probably have more clever ideas to deal with such a table . 
  yes , but the number of significant digits in the % column makes it unreadable anyway . 
  italy . 
  much of the income taxes go into maintaining an expensive and inefficient system , but on the whole it is fairly high-quality ( albeit regional standards vary wildly ) and the poor have access to decent healthcare after all . 
  pinewater seems not really ok for po . 
  it may either be : 1 ) river that digs , if * pades * comes from an indoeuropean root ( most agreed on according to wpedia ) ; 2 ) resin , if it comes from a celtic root . 
  a few names in sicily are slightly off : palermo was pan-ormos -  * all harbour * , not * good harbour * catania was founded by people from syracuse , so they would not use a foreign phoenician word to denote the relation between the new town and the larger city . 
  ( there were also no phoenicians nearby ) . 
  the origin is unclear , but according to plutarch * kat\u00e0ne * means grater . 
  others proposed kat\u00e0-aetna ( beside mt. 
  syracuse may come from the greek word for sirocco wind , or may refer to the syraka saltwater swamps ( with the roots * syr * , sour , and * aka * , water ) . 
  the map still looks better than writing `` we have no clue '' next to most very old names , though . 
  for italy it is a bit sloppy . 
  trento should not be grouped with tyrol or s\u00fcdtirol .
