  specific separatist movements in liguria , emilia , central or southern italy ( given they exist , i doubt the average italian has ever heard about any of those ) , are nowhere near the relevance of the `` serious '' ones ( sardinia , language minorities , the whole lega nord thing , etc. 
  this is misleading as it confuses the accent people have when speaking italian ( the question op asked ) with different regional languages . 
  the calabrese and pugliese examples you linked are not italian , but different regional languages that are as related to italian as other romance languages . 
  as for people from tuscany , they have an extremely thick accent : you can always pinpoint where they are from . 
  every speaker speaks italian with an accent ^ \\ ( given ^ they ^ speak ^ italian ^ and ^ not ^ their ^ regional ^ language ) , derived from the regional language/dialect of the region they are from . 
  having no accent is not associated with any region , but with formal training ( actors , anchormen , etc. 
   there are more people committing suicide than dying of heart disease , cancer or car accident . 
  given that the situation in spain is really bad , heart diseases or cancer each kill some 150 people every 100000 , while the suicide rate in spain in 2008 was 6 for 100000 people . 
  it is likely that the suicide rate may have relatively increased in recent years ( could not find any official data ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/causes_of_death_statistics ) [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oecd_countries_by_suicide_rate ), 
  ok , thanks for the explanation . 
  this calculation assumes the system response is totally linear , so to say ( and that a country is a factory ) . 
  i put forward that for a complex system this may also not be exactly the case : for instance , if the total demand of goods is much lower than the maximum productivity , there is no point in working more - and the loss due to working less may also be smaller than expected . 
  how are these figures calculated ? 
  i sampled one of those when in poznan , and chances are you may regret such a decision . 
  well , you are using a peculiar definition of `` isthmus '' , which i do n't think holds for such a landmass . 
  ( mind you , i have no interest in considering catalonia homogeneous with the rest of spain from a cultural or economic pov ) . 
   catalonia is outside of the iberian peninsula really ? 
  what about the pyrenees ? 
  my favorites : wenders - the earlier ones : alice in the cities , kings of the road , the american friend herzog , with klaus kinski - aguirre , the wrath of god is probably their best , although fitzcarraldo is astounding as well bu\u00f1uel - if you do n't know him you 're so lucky because you can watch a bunch of his movies for the first time and it 's going to be great . 
  the exterminating angel , the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie , belle de jour are my favorite , but there 's a handful of equally great ones . 
  tarkovsky - solaris , but andrei rubl\u00ebv is equally good and less known fellini - this is cinema history : i would pick 8\u00a01/2 among all . 
  risi - the easy life petri - investigation on a citizen above suspicion it 's a pity that a few very good classic italian movies can not be appreciated fully from abroad , because of their use of patois and dialects ( l'armata brancaleone , i soliti ignoti , miseria e nobilt\u00e0 ) . 
  a good compromise between his earlier movies , somewhat unintelligible for a non-italian audience , and later work . 
  even if you are familiar with british film-makers already , i would recommend peter greenaway ( belly of an architect , drowning by numbers ) . 
  sorry , but if you want to disprove the points raised by other people in this thread you should at least provide some sources to back up your claims ( i.e. 
  some data , some ranking , some statistics , whatever ) . 
  you have to admit that simply stating `` you are wrong '' is not very convincing , is it ? 
   i 've been working in an italian university for the last two years . 
  neither i nor anybody i can name has been working under the aegis of a research institute . 
  that 's great , but your anecdotes or mine do not hold much relevance in this context . 
  national institutes in italy ( cnr , infn , inaf , etc. ), 
  play as big a role as their french or german counterparts : for what it 's worth , cnr consistently ranks first among italian research institutions in scimago rankings . 
  i 'm italian . 
  i also find that the difference in taste between uht and mass-produced fresh milk does not justify the difference in price . 
  so i find convenient to rely on uht milk , which i can buy by the dozen , for everyday use , and buy a small amount of delicious and expensive fresh milk from a local small farm . 
  of course this would not hold in northern europe , where the milk is always excellent everywhere . 
  although standard italian is my mother tongue , i can speak the local dialect of my hometown ( which is a sub-variety of sicilian ) . 
  while not exactly mutually intelligible with standard italian ( especially when spoken ) , it forms a continuum so that you can go from slightly-inflected italian to full-blown dialect just by substituting words . 
  most of the words that are not shared with italian come from arabic , spanish and french , due to the peculiar history of sicily after the fall of rome . 
  sicilian has a social stigma attached to it , especially in larger cities , and in general it is prevalent among the less affluent people . 
  being associated with stereotype mobsters in italy and abroad does not help either . 
  in general , it is common that anyone will try to `` italianize '' as much as possible when speaking to people they are not familiar with . 
  on the other hand , most cultured people can speak and understand some dialect , using it in informal context . 
  in smaller towns , and farther from the coast , its use is more widespread and carefree . 
   are you honestly trying to convince me that greeks are as diligent in paying their taxes as the finns ? 
  please , you do n't know the points i am trying to make - because i am not trying to make any . 
  i have pointed out that : ( 1 ) you made a very broad statements ( tax rates in northern europe are higher ) which is not true , backing it up with data that do not say nothing at all ; ( 2 ) you made another statement `` we do not cheat on our taxes '' - which is neither true nor false , it is just pointless when you are trying to discuss data . 
   also , we do not cheat as much on our taxes , which means we do actually pay what we have to . 
  with such arguments i do n't think you need any quantitative data to support your views . 
   northern europeans pay more taxes than southern europeans . 
  in fact , based on this plot , the two groups seem to be very well intermixed ( e.g. 
  denmark , netherlands and norway having lower taxes than italy and spain , etc. 
  you are not completely right . 
  there have been two center-left governments in italy since b. 
  's first government in 1994 , yet they could not ultimately do significantly better than b. 
  ( except for not giving a terrible image of themselves abroad ) . 
  the point in monti 's government is that there are no politicians in it , so it is almost free from vetoes and bargains that bind all parties to the interests of this or that group . 
  trying not to displease anyone has always been the bane of all italian governments . 
  because of this reason , the present situation is also not going to last for long . 
  and `` il giornale '' is the ultimate trolling `` newspaper '' in italy ( imagine the most philistine and reactionary leaflet whose readership is only composed of diehard berlusconi fans ) , so i guess that 's not really a debate worth following . 
  you 've probably never heard of * cccp fedeli alla linea * , a seminal italian alternative rock band of the 80s , combining soviet union , islam , traditional folk music from emilia-romagna , and punk rock . 
  their album [ epica etica etnica pathos ] ( http://grooveshark.com/#/album/epica+etica+etnica+pathos+2008+remastered+edition+/3811655 ) is ridiculously good . 
  this is probably one of the worst-designed websites i 've seen in a while , and the readability of this piece is no better . 
  bad as he may be ( and this guy certainly is ) , it is the entire italian ruling class ( political , administrative , economical ) that is deeply inadequate/short-sighted/suicidal . 
  in this respect , i do n't see how any political leader backed by the same people who back him could be much worse . 
  exceptions ( prodi , monti , draghi , the late padoa-schioppa ) are treated as weird aliens , and promptly wiped out way before they can innovate anything . 
  the ( short ) long list of italian songs . 
  just a few suggestions . 
  traditional italian songs ( actually , traditional neapolitan songs ) have become palatable abroad thanks to the `` canzone napoletana '' sung in neapolitan dialect ( ' o sole mio , funicul\u00ec funicul\u00e0 , ' o surdato ` nnamurato , torna a surriento ) . 
  i argue that there 's something more to be taken from italian pop music of the last , say , 50 years . 
  note : the works of some artists can be appreciated just for the sake of music , but many others require some of the lyrics to be understood . 
  many artists used songs to convey social/political messages ( we had the strongest communist party in europe , after all ) . 
  in any case , some basic understanding of the lyrics will add to your enjoyment . 
  i will deliberately not cover the so called `` musica leggera '' ( mainstream pop , often devoid of any musical quality ) after the seventies , although it is still predominant , and also very popular in latin america : cfr . 
  the late fifties/early sixties were the years of the `` economic boom '' : some of the most successful songs from that era are still recognizable by everyone , like the ones by domenico modugno : [ nel blu dipinto di blu ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-dvi0ugelc ) , arguably the best known italian song of the last 50 years ; gianni morandi : [ c ` era un ragazzo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4_dg1zyqtg ) , [ fatti mandare dalla mamma a prendere il latte ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7elbr4xqt_4 ) ; gino paoli : ( [ sapore di sale ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofn4i78ukew ) , [ il cielo in una stanza ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt091rqpnzs ) caution corny video . 
  mina and lucio battisti were by far the most talented and successful musicians in the sixties and early seventies . 
  mina was an extremely gifted singer , and her unconventional public persona granted her a ban from italian tv , where she was the first female rock and roll singer ever to appear . 
  * mina : [ tintarella di luna ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92y-zid0aba ) , [ se telefonando ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxx4pdw7dlm ) , [ brava ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poemrczynk8 ) , [ grande grande grande ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4msw-saves ) * lucio battisti : [ mi ritorni in mente ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aoumcgonwc ) , [ acqua azzurra acqua chiara ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqeue6hw6um ) , [ un ` avventura ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atnmahxyj5m ) , [ il mio canto libero ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukyohc4p21c ) in the seventies , a new generation of politically committed `` cantautori '' ( singers/songwriters ) came in : * lucio dalla : [ caruso ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxgolyfxsnk ) , [ l'anno che verr\u00e0 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88klo8boxu ) , [ disperato erotico stomp ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsq_ovnriec ) * francesco de gregori : he was later defined `` the legend of italian pop music '' by bob dylan himself , and released good albums even after the seventies : [ il bandito e il campione ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrbrjryfcga ) , [ la donna cannone ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsw7_q3yz-w ) , [ la leva calcistica della classe ' 68 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvv0hbqdidy ) , [ titanic ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzfbxbprvg8 ) * rino gaetano : [ il cielo \u00e8 sempre pi\u00f9 blu ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8ioog-paxq ) * francesco guccini : [ dio \u00e8 morto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5xy42y4m8a ) * fabrizio de andr\u00e8 : reminiscent of dylan and cohen , he arguably penned the best lyrics in italian pop music . 
  he also released many good albums along four decades : [ verranno a chiederti del nostro amore ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ous_watkqto ) , [ bocca di rosa ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcxv1t_qipq ) * franco battiato : his early 70s albums were fine experiments in progressive rock , minimalism and contemporary classical music . 
  later evolved to be a postmodern singer , blending eclectic highbrow and pop references : [ centro di gravit\u00e0 permanente ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfgz-t5r0be ) , [ voglio vederti danzare ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngyflitlxgk ) , [ cuccurucu paloma ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu_b0ef65q4 ) . 
  paolo conte : `` the lawyer '' . 
  he was never politically committed , and never had much to do with italian traditions , taking inspiration from swing , early jazz , french chansonniers , and topping off with his peculiar blas\u00e9 humor . 
  probably the best know italian musician abroad among connoisseurs . 
  ( the booklet of his cds contain lyrics in four languages ) . 
  * [ via con me ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq2gyuldkoc ) * [ azzurro ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smdncjbdtea ) * [ gelato al limon ] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vzxpbahl48 ) * [ bartali ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la5jbsedie0 ) * [ max ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocy6yglhhbi ) * [ sotto le stelle del jazz ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-2i3wufblu ) progressive rock inspired by genesis or king crimson was also very popular among italian youngsters in the seventies , much more than in other countries , and many acts started as backing bands for `` cantautori '' , who penned songs for them . 
  they also had abstruse names , such as premiata forneria marconi [ la carrozza di hans ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdrtznxbypq ) , or banco del mutuo soccorso [ r.i.p. ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of0mq339imc ) . 
  area , led by singer extraordinaire demetrio stratos , brought leftist experimental jazz-rock to the extremes , until stratos ' premature death : * [ luglio , agosto , settembre nero ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oyshwzy1_k ) * [ consapevolezza ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prbrt7epepm ) * [ arbeit macht frei ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cguaj_42nq8 ) * [ cometa rossa ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatimocvcns ) with post-punk , diaframma [ siberia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkeunjgogk0 ) and litfiba were the `` joy division of florence '' . 
  litfiba proved to be less ephemeral , reshaping their sound to include heavier elements : [ el diablo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok12_utbn3y ) . 
  cccp formed in berlin , but their `` pro-soviet punk '' drew from middle-eastern music as much as from folk music from emilia-romagna ( a longtime communist stronghold ) , with a distinctive tongue-in-cheek use of soviet iconography for cover art . 
  despite his idiosyncratic singing tone , giovanni lindo ferretti was for sure one of the most distinctive frontmen that an italian rockband ever had . 
  cccp later disbanded and reformed as c.s.i. , abandoning much of the absurdist themes . 
  `` epica etica etnica pathos '' ( by cccp ) and `` linea gotica '' ( by c.s.i. ), 
  stand anyway as landmarks in italian alternative rock . 
  cccp : * [ militanz ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0to1_b1ja0m ) * [ io sto bene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2stdemwjs0 ) * [ huligani dangereux ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyful-jgoqg ) c.s.i. 
  : * [ linea gotica ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nozxnvdpuuw ) * [ irata ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9to-z02z7qo ) nineties and beyond . 
  italian pop/rock scene became much less peculiar , and the similarities between models ( nirvana , sonic youth ) and ripoffs were often appalling . 
  singing in italian also became again synonym of provincialism , as it was in the early days of rock 'n roll . 
  some notable examples of recent alternative rock worth a listen : * afterhours : [ male di miele ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iknhppyq4ao ) * marlene kuntz : [ lieve ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtrvs8rkvkq ) * subsonica : [ radioestensioni ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3vo97_axnu ) * scisma : [ tungsteno ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oyf6moscbi ) * cristina don\u00e0 : [ goccia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gukfniso18i ) * fluxus : [ giro di vite ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzjsr77thjy ) * massimo volume : [ fausto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnqfnns99ge ) * perturbazione : [ del nostro tempo rubato ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1m5e9skiu8 ) hope i put all the links at the right place . 
  edit : ca n't seem to get the lists look right .
