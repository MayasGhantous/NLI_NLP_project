  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hope ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ wrong . 
  100 % truth , but my comment was pretty much joke comment . 
  you can sneak it . 
  thought i 'm sure that would be brutal fatality death . 
  op deliver please . 
  damn it 's nice view up hereeeeeeee.aaaaaahhhhhh, 
  who 's there ? 
  naming them = / = naming their geographical location . 
  no one says you 're . 
  it 's just stupid stereotypical joke . 
  that 's explains why australia and sweden exchanged 12 !, 
  australia more yurop than murica . 
  lithuania televoted russia # 3 , it was juries who made them get 0 points . 
  san marino on other hand was jury only . 
  yes . 
  since 2011 . 
  and junior eurovision in 2007 . 
  well uk always # 1 televote lithuania . . so does ireland . . 
  i guess we could arrange some points for you two . 
  overall performance was bad . 
  first time they did that was n't scriped - improvisation . 
  now they both just enjoyed themselves . 
  lithuanian are tryhard at televoting . 
  if not for restrictions , every country with lithuania emigrants would have lithuania as # 1 televote . 
  song itself was pretty good , but perfomance - not rly . 
  whole country is brainwashed just like you . 
  this is song contest , not politics . 
  and as far as i know , those singers did n't kill anyone . 
  go ahead and prove me wrong . 
  i 'm pretty sure juries gave 0 on propose . 
  inb4government entitles me as traitor and jails me . 
  or i, 
  rank 3 televoting . 
  i 'm happy about that , what about you ? 
  uk televoted lithuania to rank # 1 was because of emigrants . 
  tbh most lithuania points where because of televoting by emigrants . 
  we voted russians to 3rd place , it was our bribed judges for made russian receive 0 points . 
  personally i did n't like russian song , but they deserve every point they got . 
  edit : glad 99 % of voting was n't politics/favoritism related . 
  i 'm sure i have n't seen that since 2004 or so . 
  and their 0 geography knowledge * proceeds to fail at america geography *, 
  russian population is pretty much lower than estonia and latvia , but either whole nation is brain-washed or votes where forged . 
  also , was n't overall voting pretty much talent/perfomance biased rather than politics/favoritism ( except lithuania and points we received - too much emigrants ) ? 
  edit : juries was bribed . 
  no idea . 
  research time i guess . 
  seems like this year it 's actually songs winning it . 
  uhm russia is at top3 . . 
  cool . 
  will they bring kangaroos ? 
  i do n't know . . 
  i tend to be optimist , but i 've strong pessimistic opinion right here . 
  yeah , we had everything - cute girl , gay and lesbian kiss , but i hope we do n't win . 
  we have nowhere to host it . . damn , we do n't have money for that !, 
  hm , not really sure what else could it be . 
  http://picamax.lt/images/pics/alkoholiniai_gerimai/%c5%bealios-999.jpg best picture i could find :|, 
  indeed it 's , but samogitian sounds awesome . 
  `` lituanica '' or something like that is pretty good . 
  i suck at vodka names . 
  first time hearing us referred as lowlanders . 
  always been using samogitians . 
  as long as it 's proper vodka . 
  lol , what i 'm talking about , finnish vodka best vodka . 
  that was the agreement . 
  wow . 
  wow . 
  where you live at ? 
  i 'm buying you a beer . 
  and vodka . 
  and etc. 
  which city you live in ? 
  in tel\u0161iai most of girls are really beautiful . 
  we will need everyone to help with that . 
  best ones stayed . 
  trust me . 
  in that case australia would choose who 's host , and they would co-host . 
  if you want you can get 500mbps pretty cheap too . 
  i do n't use up 100 so there 's no point for faster . 
  i would even get slower , but they do n't include iptv . 
  i get 100mbps literally for free ( comparing to already low wages ) . 
  as adult who quit drinking at age of 17 ( dumb dumb dumb idiot ) , i agree . 
  99 % of girls in lithuania are as beautiful as she is . 
  i 'm guy and i 've crush on him . 
  turns out i 'm gay . 
  they totally will . 
  we all hope so . 
  `` dude , it 's just a prank , its a prank '', 
  nope . 
  it 's just one of theories . 
  main one is , plane went missing due to malfunction . 
  it was ~ 32 ~ 33 years old plane . 
  not sure for best , but ** skirmantas ** is worst for sure . 
  thanks to one advertisement on tv , that name defines butt-crack . 
  saw `` erasmus '' in link . 
  content just what i expected . 
  nope , it 's worse . 
  personally wickler and hostler were my favourites . 
  i was there for month only , but it was enough to learn how real beer tastes ( not like 4 times more expensive and 0.25 times as good in quality , here in lithuania ), 
  indeed . 
  beer is super cheap in germany .
