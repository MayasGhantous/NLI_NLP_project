oh those german search engines obsessed with slavs to the ost !, 
  estonia has larger land area than netherlands and a population of 1.3 mil , it wo n't mean a thing to the world if they were to reach replacement level or even some growth , but it 'd be huge for estonia . 
  indeed they do . 
  weird that they had birth rate peak in 2010 and then decline while pretty much opposite was in latvia . 
  eurovision : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1c7gdoafy0, 
  great . 
  now get on with that birth rate , world needs more cute little eestis !, 
  i may need a tinfoil hat but according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) book . 
  ethnic tensions in polish-lithuanian relations is very valuable element that should be used and if possible aggravated . 
  and then we have that guy . 
  and yeah , that title is cringe worthy , no idea why it stuck as suggestion . 
  weird that it comes up with english search phrase as well . 
  well , it does n't take a whole lot of demand when you 're capable of selling even a photo of potato for [ 1mil eur ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/27/arts/potato-photo-million-euros/ ), 
  plz do n't fear , we friendly !, 
  yea , i do n't get the same results : [ 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lvxgzu7.png ) [ 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zgwizxf.png ) fwiw , i think results with lithuanian search phrases are more interesting anyway . 
  oh man , when i was checking lithuanian suggestions finland had the weirdest one :  why finns export very little of crude wood ? 
  eh , maybe i was a bit unclear . 
  i meant common folks in lithuania , not this sub . 
  having this overly glorified picture of west was major drive for baltic people in 90s too and it 's not only better pay that leads to people emigrating today but this picture in people 's head of place where everything 's better . 
  regarding this sub i do n't see much hate towards west from baltic states . 
  disagreement towards the handling of refugee crisis ? 
  sure , but even that gets exaggerated due to the nature of internet comments . 
  lol wtf , west is over glorified by common people here , seen as some sort of almost utopia . 
  i now feel like buying big car . 
  oh , based on that lithuanian suggestions would be : 1 . 
  gave ultimatum to lithuania in 1938 2 . 
  does n't have euro . 
  why germany attacked poland . 
  integration ! = assimilation . 
  neither poles nor lithuanians had a problem speaking russian whenever needed in ussr . 
  i 'm not really sure if there 's even an issue , i was of impression that mostly old folks were the ones who did not know how to speak lithuanian . 
  every young pole i 've met spoke it fine . 
  our greens are like watermelon - green on the outside , red on the inside . 
  based on this , it 'd be mari people that are closest to balts apparently and they live in russia . 
  this might be more what you 're looking for : http://admixturemap.paintmychromosomes.com/, 
  you 're correct in that perception of each other has gone downhill within last ten years . 
  i would not however take making fun of you as an indication of not liking you since we pretty much make fun of everyone around us and mainly ourselves . 
  here , for example `` latvians '' commenting our presidential candidates : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhv7u-fd2fo, 
  not much of an explanation then i suppose !, 
  he 's danish , liths and poles apparently have a rep of stealing their bikes . 
  people can dream all they want , what do i care . 
  now if it 's more than just dreaming but an actual action , i suppose it 'd depend on it 's merit , say if latvia said they love us a lot and want to be one country with us but does n't want their flag to look like africa , i certainly would n't mind changing our flag to something new in order to indicate this union . 
  oi mate , we may come off as a bit nutty sometimes but we would never nuke our shopping center !, 
  whew lad , you just gave depression to my depression !, 
  that is deeply concerning . 
  it 's not very active , but yeah it 's about lithuania , mostly q&a for foreigners sometimes some discussion on random lithuania happenings . 
  the most important part is probably identifying as british , polish , danish etc first rather than wherever your parents or grandparents came from . 
  i do n't really believe one can feel that way if he was n't born there and brought up in culture of host country . 
  place of origin of ones ancestors is n't of much importance , there 's been a lot of mixing in europe as it is and that does n't stop one from identifying with host nation . 
  lol , no thanks . 
  who ? 
  the general director of baltma tours ? 
  that 's our president who said it . 
  well to be fair even reading western news one could easily get the impression that we 're in constant state of preparedness for war or something purely because that 's what gets the most attention . 
  oh hell , poland is blobbing again . 
  just taking care of what matters . 
  naw , we should send someone like these guys : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nztuomsqzo, 
  whose quote is that ? 
  they teach you that at school ? 
  that 'll do , we steal most of eesti jokes from russians anyway . 
  i suppose you could but you gon na have to come up with a few good eesti is slow jokes , we kinda ran out of ideas . 
  i salute you in joining the club . 
  now you gon na show up in the annual baltic way meeting where we 'll hold hands and sings songs then we 'll raise a lithuanian flag . 
  it 'll be fun !, 
  i 'm not saying they did not stop to conduct an exercise , what i 'm saying is that they conducted their exercises en route to klaip\u0117da . 
  as in exercise -  go to klaip\u0117da . 
  hence why that particular location was chosen . 
   americans told that they were conducting a joint military exercise with poland and you are saying they were travelling ( which they did go to klaipeda almost a day later ca n't they do both ? 
  well you said they blatantly chose this position to do exercise and i told you why they were there . 
  effective resource management , that 's all . 
  it was traveling to klaip\u0117da where else would it go through ? 
  no surprises , still hilarious seeing our dear president , first one to be impeached european head of state , rolandas paksas voting against . 
  i hold three cards , two aces , one deuce . 
  you pick a card if it 's an ace you win one euro , if it 's a deuce you lose five euros . 
  odds are in your favor , but you 'll lose money in the long run . 
  that 's a weird definition of gambling . 
  you can both gamble with odds in your favor or against and neither is inherently bad or good decision without taking into account cost/payoff . 
  russian empire did n't mind as much us using latin letters as they did mind us using polish ones because they did not want us get influenced by poles and join up in uprising with them so in order to get the ban on latin letters lifted we decided to adopt czech letters instead . 
  or something along those lines . 
  prob at least partly because our is n't like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j5lbum8.jpg ) anymore . 
  but where 's the proofs it 's russian ? 
   make lithuania ~ ~ great ~ ~ grand again !, 
  fyp, 
  it 's probably the only country 's name that i ca n't stop mistyping . 
  all thanks to the glorious cz !, 
  it 's been removed anyway . 
  it is however up on / r/imagesofrussia / r/freeeuropenews / r/besteurope, 
  so much wrong in one picture . 
  leaving fb tab with someone 's full name ? 
  and most importantly , soad ?!, 
  come on !, 
  do n't remember exact source for that specific one , sorry . 
  [ this ] ( http://worldhappiness.report/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/statisticalappendixwhr2016.pdf ) ( pdf file , pg 15 for the happiness chart ) is the most up to date one i think . 
  re , language , thanks , really nice to hear that . 
  yes it is pretty hard , especially grammar , speaking is much easier imo  regarding suicide rates , not one of the highest in europe but in the world ( second after greenland ) . 
  the reason why is a question i do ask myself but i ca n't really come up with a good answer , we 're not the poorest , we 're not [ unhappiest ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rc4mmjk.jpg ) . 
  people point to alcoholism which is certainly a problem , but so it is in other similar countries yet while the suicide levels are fairly high there as well it 's not close to our level . 
  then we have [ pil\u0117nai ] ( http://www.ancient-origins.net/history/mass-suicide-pilenai-lithuanian-defenders-choose-death-over-enslavement-002855 ) or [ romas kalanta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romas_kalanta ) maybe that 's just how we are culturally . 
  although it does n't seem like we were as suicidal in [ interwar period . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7txesyj.gif ) and while it gone down from early independence years , the rate fluctuates around 31-36/100 k for the last ten years .
