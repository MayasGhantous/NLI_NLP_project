  pretty much . 
  some people like her , some do n't . 
  she got reelected last year so i suppose the overall view of her is quite positive . 
  yeah , i 'm glad that this year 's tree is back to more traditional look . 
  it 's supposed to be a `` smart '' interactive christmas tree , [ this website ] ( http://kaunoeglute.lt/ ) will automatically upload guest pictures and stream the tree 's moving toys etc in real time . 
  good luck learning lithuanian . 
  poor lonely guy from south korea . 
  that 's cute . 
  eagerly awaiting pictures of kaunas 's tree , should look quite nice too .

  * allow borders to be redrawn like that * let the emigration/immigration continue as usual * repeat first two steps until * ????? 
  * all euroland are belong to baltics !, 
  french : les revenants . 
  uk : black mirror , utopia . 
  yea , sure . 
  not saying it 's not ridiculous . 
   and those sneaky bastards do n't warn about storing cookies !, 
  in my limited experience , all public sector clients are pain in the ass ( not only in lt ) . 
  their requirements make it pretty much impossible to make a good looking intuitive website . 
  and they do pretty much want more of the same . 
  fwiw , last saturday another officer accidentally shot and wounded a homeless guy with his automatic rifle . 
  whoever came up with this idea to handle out kalashnikovs to under prepared officers to ensure our safety is most certainly mental . 
  interesting . 
  somewhat related , in lt it was ~ 61 % as completely against . 
  the matryoshka 's are behind this, 
  hearing this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy . 
  go france !, 
  do n't think this should be posted at all . 
  being assimilated with potatoes is not a laughing matter !, 
  hahaha !, 
  brilliant !, 
  after return from denmark i kept noticing how everyone seemed to be walking around with a frown on their face . 
  some people wore flu masks . 
  people seemed cold and distant . 
  i felt rather depressed for a while but all 's well that ends well . 
  few days later i was back to being my good ol' grumpy self . 
  whoa . 
  had no idea about getjar . 
  that 's rather inspiring !, 
  there 's no other way but the german way !, 
  making the world laugh is never a waste of time . 
  sweden can push for it as much as they want , wo n't change the fact that refugees do n't want to go anywhere else . 
  not to eastern europe at least . 
  we ca n't even convince few hundred to come over . 
  so what are we supposed to do ? 
  get them here by force , forbid to leave and expect them to integrate ? 
  nothing . 
  fwiw , you 'd lose clay to newly re-established prussia and become dmz . 
  did n't know stoners are secret nazis . 
  same here , only that weather is bad , snowing + strong wind . 
  yea , they also pretty much enslave some naive lithuanians that come over looking for work . 
  nothing surprising [ prison population average per year per 100k inhabitants ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/e/e7/prison_population%2c_average_per_year%2c_2007%e2%80%9309_and_2010%e2%80%9312_%28per_100_000_inhabitants%29_yb14.png ) on one hand i 'm happy that those criminals go away and we do n't have much of organized crime locally , on the other hand they go away to other countries do crime there and paint us all in bad light . 
  people are n't all that hesitant to open doors as other user is trying to portray , random politicians go door to door before elections , u\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s has trick or treating with masks on and it 's alive and well . 
  the only people that are hesitant to open doors to strangers are grannies , they tend to be very paranoid from my experience . 
  ca n't really blame them i suppose . 
  the correct answer is poland , everything 's cheap there . 
   you have finland nearby , have n't you heard any of the absolutely terrifying horror stories about the effects of the state monopoly on alcohol ? 
  the blatant price-gouging ? 
  five euros for a glass of beer ? 
  clearly not , since one of their arguments for this was that nords have it so it 's fiineeee . 
   but perhaps there is more to them than that there really is n't , they sucked up all the uninformed and protest votes and crushed conservatives even in their stronghold kaunas because new mayor ( who 's really liked ) hates conservatives and supported peasants all over the place . 
  people kinda got tricked too i 'd say , the man who lead the party to a win - skvernelis is n't all that relevant and the man who stood behind him , karbauskis will be the one calling the shots . 
  expecting us to dwarf poles now on political comedy gold . 
  napro infertility treatments and such . 
  basically https://media.giphy.com/media/axmy0g9z9khzc/giphy.gif, 
   you should be looking at two countries , not one . 
  [ for now . 
  with very high certainity - eastern/western/southern european . 
  with fairly high certainity - germans/french/russians . 
  currently the difference between peasants and homeland union is mere 0.1 % with areas that will support ts-lkd still not having delivered data , it 'll be even or slight win for ts and then second round in single mandates will decide fully , so far ts-lkd has one mandate more here than peasants . 
  pro russian parties only . 
  if he doesnt want to go he probably wont be taken anyway , theres enough volunteers . 
  other internet surveys i 've seen were quite similar . 
  youth very often supports either homeland union or liberals , they both go hand in hand . 
  liberals have been hit by a corruption scandal when their now ex leader was cought with 106k euros bribe and since electorate of liberals is extra sensitive to such things their ratings took a nose dive . 
  lietuva can into imaginary top 10 richest list !, 
   but ts-lkd is dangerously strong at the moment and i do n't want them anywhere near me . 
  why ? 
  ageless car , eternally in style . 
  my gang fits in there and three bags of potatoes . 
  well since you found \u010d , might as well go with full lithuanization - \u0160erlokas holmesikevi\u010dius . 
  though we just call him \u0160erlokas holmsas , fwiw . 
  in denmark average age of first marriage for women is like 32 , men 34 . 
  thaaat 's a lot of cinnamon . 
  they do kinda sound meh , but personally our country 's name in english is the worst . 
  how the hell does lietuva ( like lietus - rain ) become lithuania ? 
  are you also not / u/poliak1 ? 
  grats to polan on beating south africa !, 
   find lithuania the least offensive heh , why ? 
  we do n't but that 's still better than losing people to emigration . 
  and you 're not yet near iceland 's level on % of population in capital , nothing to worry about . 
  why worrying ? 
  way better they go to the capital than abroad . 
  fwiw , it 's not only migration , birth rates are higher in vilnius than death rates . 
  i assume same is the case in other baltic states . 
  we should get more capitals then !, 
  i suppose one thing that impacts us and poles is that we 're being taught at schools about religious/ethnic tolerance of olden poland & lithuania . 
  a matter of perspective , i 'd say your water violated our ship . 
  rightful lithuanian clay !, 
   you have no idea what you 're speaking .
