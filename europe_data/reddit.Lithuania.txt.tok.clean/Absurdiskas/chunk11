  what 's with the attitude ? 
  this thread will be fun . 
  looks like ... britain 's got talent ... . ^ ^ ^ yeaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, 
  as [ per my other post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51s0c3/suicide_rates_by_country_in_europe/d7een96 ) , vilnius is n't suicidal , it 's suicide rate is roughly that of sweden , less developed regions are . 
  merely ~ 18 % of population lives in capital though , as opposed to for example ~ 32 % in latvia . 
  well since we 're leaders and all , here 's data [ 2011-2014 ] ( http://www.vpsc.lt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=355%3aduomenys-apie-20112013-m-saviudybi-skaii-pasiskirstym-pagal-ami-lyt-savivaldybes-ir-mirties-prieastis&amp;catid=14%3asaviudybi-statistika&amp;itemid=24&amp;lang=en ) and up to [ 2015 ] ( http://osp.stat.gov.lt/en/statistiniu-rodikliu-analize?portletformname=visualization&amp;hash=cb4770dc-b9fa-4276-867a-69148cb60f9a ) our numbers are higher for 2012 than those by who . 
  not much has changed , most suicidal group is [ 75 + years old ] ( http://www.vpsc.lt/images/stories/saviz_statistika/saviz_amz_gr_lyti2014.jpg ) capital is n't much into suicide with a rate of 11.6 / 100k . 
  we 're samurais . 
  texas also has median age of 33 years , while poland 's is ~ 38 and will continue to grow , which will lessen the workforce and put a bigger strain on them as they will have to support more and more pensioners , this will halt economic growth and we 'll never converge with west . 
  same problem for us . 
  i think taking people in from countries of compatible cultures is good short term fix to lessen economic impact that comes from emigration and low fertility , once we grow enough , we 'll have the resources to tackle those problems internally imo . 
  good for you baltic bro !,

  when i think of a drinking song , the first one that pops to my mind is [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdeenpes51s ) chorus : so lock me up dear father !, 
  in sauna and do n't let me out , until i sober up !, 
  it usually does n't go without [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhy28wihtge ) either . 
  that 's why he has the sword out , he 's killing commie potatoes . 
  many lithuanian surnames have a polish equivalent . 
  like say from top ten most common surnames : jankauskas - jankowski , kavaliauskas - kowalewski etc. 
  so there 's nothing exceptional about her surname , i suppose except that in both polish grzyb and in lithuanian grybas means the same thing . 
  friendship is not a thing in the lands of baltirus . 
  [ you 'd love that would n't you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b3sggq7.jpg ), 
  [ ohhh yea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14ie7e ), 
  that 'd wreck us economically , so not really fun !, 
  in the long run things would normalize and we 'd be aight , maybe some cee union would be formed . 
  you 're supposed to splash on the whole bottle !, 
  more kcal for the buck !, 
  na , they 're not balts either , they 're [ finnic people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_finns ), 
  but where 's the fun in that ? 
  they 're kinda southerners of the north . 
  no real snow and quite extroverted people . 
  i wonder if there 's even a single country where majority would want to see an unified eu delegation . 
  depression ai n't something to ignore , so see a doctor about it if you have n't already . 
  also as far as i recall you live in quite depressing place , so maybe consider moving once you 're finished up with your studies . 
  kaunas/vilnius are quite nice places to live !, 
  as if everyone lives that way, 
  well , he made the crime against humanity by ripping off `` born in the usa '' and making it all shitty . 
  we gave citizenship to everyone who wanted it regardless of what language they spoke . 
  we 've never been close to 4 mil . 
  [ 3,690 mil in 1989 ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_m._lietuvos_gyventoj\u0173_sura\u0161ymas ) today there 's [ 2,866,935 people ] ( http://osp.stat.gov.lt/web/guest/statistiniu-rodikliu-analize?portletformname=visualization&amp;hash=f201640d-ef5e-421d-bed9-845eb20e505e ) living in lithuania . 
  so not quite as extreme as you assume , still quite a loss . 
  commonly known as hipsters . 
  ye we sound nothing alike but there 's quite a few words we share , this month there 's been a dictionary released of polonizms in lithuanian language , dictionary is 764 pages long . 
  as far as i recall poles too have some words of baltic origin , although belarusians have more if i recall correctly . 
  baltic states 7,907,031 back then , currently 6,156,579 . 
  hmph , i 've heard that joke before . 
  anyone know who 's the original source ? 
  on the bright side , great for gdp !, 
  hey , they operate abroad as well and it works , had no idea reserved was polish !, 
  they 're proud of not being proud . 
  we 're austrians now ? 
  central europe based on cultural proximity lines kinda looks like a maple leaf . 
  but we do talk about it , wtf are you on . 
  as if you 've not heard of suicide prevention lines that get advertised all the time . 
  much more should be done but i kinda doubt that anything major will change without major focus on economic development of smaller regions . 
  because it 'd bot improve quality of life of people who live there and make em more attractive for specialist to move there . 
  currently i doubt that a great healthcare specialist ( psychiatrists / psychologists too ) will want to move into small town with sharply declining population . 
  it 's a contributor but not the main one . 
  kaunas has more than double the suicide rate of vilnius but slightly longer life expectancy . 
  there are [ other things we excel at ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/7/70/causes_of_death_\u2014_standardised_death_rate_of_people_aged_less_than_65%2c_2013.png ) that have bigger impact imo . 
  i 've no idea how you managed to jump from suicides to jews and i would n't say that i 'm particularly interested to find out or argue with whatever this is . 
  have a nice day !, 
  oh yeah , certainly . 
  which part of the country you live in is also important . 
  people live longest in [ klaip\u0117da , kaunas , vilnius ] ( http://osp.stat.gov.lt/web/guest/statistiniu-rodikliu-analize?portletformname=visualization&amp;hash=1c4740a7-fdde-47be-be5c-41a4feb8532c ) lowest is in utena , 2 year difference too . 
  that 's probably due to superior healthcare services in major cities of lithuania when compared to smaller regions . 
  hey it ai n't too bad , if you 're a woman you can live almost as long as norwegian man and if you 're a man your life expectancy is as long as that of myanmarese woman !, 
  that 's because they could only choose the languages other than their mother tongue . 
  thewire should feel ashamed that they used such a low res photo , look at them pixels fffs !, 
  24.54 % seems rather low , i suppose they did n't take into account private lithuanian torrent sites that are probably the most popular ones . 
  til ukrainians use ` pan ' . 
  i 'd say we 're quite conservative , maybe slightly less so than poland . 
  anyway , big part of why moving out early is a thing is because in lithuania one pretty much must attend university or college to not be a shame for the family and best ones are in kaunas/vilnius so anyone who does n't live there but wants to get good education gets to move out of their parent 's home . 
  i suppose natives to those cities stay with parents a bit longer but generally not until marriage . 
  many live in flats , that are rather small , not much personal space for young person and may get pretty annoying if you go out partying or want to bring someone back home etc. 
  not common , most folks move out when they begin to study or work . 
  not at least for the last 100 years or so . 
  average age for first marriage : 29 - men , 27 - women . 
  first child at roughly same time . 
  we were to them , the most inferior of all baltic states . 
   of which i never hear the balts stop complaining about ... let 's be real , most baltic / r/europe posters would rather see them closed . 
  i 'll give you that some posters certainly come off too edgy in that regard but i can assure you that it 's not reflective of majority population . 
   you 're dead set on ( just like the other guy ) on creating arguments against things nobody is proposing currently . 
  i think it 's called a ` strawman ' unless i am mistaken . 
  pray , do tell me , how does enforcing your language and identity on people who are not of your language or identity keep your language and identity alive ? 
  or do you have some sort of a neofascist/stalinist identity that mandates that everyone must assimilate into the oneness of the community of ein volk , ein sprache , ein reich ? 
  russian people are russian . 
  you are free to restrict their immigration into your country or hell but trying to force the ones already in your nation to assimilate is being no better than the ussr you claimed to hate , congrats . 
  dude , chill , i 'm not arguing anything , you said you do n't understand why language is so important to us , i briefly explained . 
  i 'm not advocating some sort of assimilation process nor we 're attempting to do that sort of thing . 
  and here i thought that our language commission is retarded . 
  on the bright side , shitty roads do wonders against blitzkrieg . 
  yeah , terrorists did n't achieve anything , such ` pranks ' have been a thing for as far back as i can recall and happens semi-regularly . 
  we do n't really buy much from us at all though . 
  polish , german , french or russian it does n't matter as much , still `` our people '' . 
  if some lithuanian went on polish killing spree you 'd see plenty of outrage . 
  stealing shit and such is n't what gets public outraged . 
  i 'd say epp but that 's with very little knowledge of listed parties . 
  whew , did n't know dugin now lives in spain, 
  foreign born citizens - yes , during soviet times .
