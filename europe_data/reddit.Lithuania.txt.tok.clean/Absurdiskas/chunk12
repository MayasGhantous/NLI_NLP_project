  but migrants of today come from the same countries as well . 
  our poles are locals . 
  most of our migrants come from non-eu countries : 1 . 
  russians 2 . 
  cern is work of the devil . 
  too bad eesti has left !, 
  kowalski becomes kovalski , no w letter in lithuanian alphabet , that 's all . 
  yeah , and after top spot goes poland so that leaves croats as third !, 
  ca n't let the puzzle [ stay unfinished ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1yzj7ud.png ), 
  i 'd imagine it goes both ways, 
  maybe people would be less ignorant had you not participated in baltic way , sang songs about three baltic sisters awakening and did n't join up in baltic assembly . 
  ca n't speak for latvia and i suppose estonia is kinda nordic wannabe but we , liths totally do n't care about becoming discount nords . 
  as if we 're not fashionable [ now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uroi5ww.jpg ), 
  we also were progressive before it was cool . 
  probably has more to do with [ this ] ( http://passel.unl.edu/pages/informationmodule.php?idinformationmodule=1130447033&amp;topicorder=7&amp;maxto=7 ), 
  lol , sealand got big !, 
  well that 's rather easy in our case - latvia . 
  \u0160iauliai too and at first vilnius was given to poland as well . 
  he 's like uspaskich for western minded folk . 
  go get a real job . 
  too bad his [ prophet ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2003/world/europe/03/14/offbeat.lithuania.rasputin.reut/ ) did n't foresee this . 
  ppp adjusted does take into account cost of living . 
  difference between czech and polish wages is rather small but one has much higher gdp ppp and positive net migration while the other one negative . 
  not sure what that changes . 
  people still move to uk or ireland way more than to germany . 
  these countries have the advantage of english language which is first foreign language for pretty much everyone meanwhile german is n't all that widespread even as second foreign language . 
   would ' t be surprised if we had 2.6 now if we were to adjust our current gdp to that population to get per capita gdp ppp it 'd make us ahead of spain and czechia . 
  doubt we 'd be having current levels of negative net migration if that were the case . 
  ca n't speak for other baltic states but at least for lithuanians top destination by far is uk , not germany . 
  even czechia 's evil twin chechia made the list !, 
  i 'd say things been pretty good lately . 
  ca n't really recall anything negative within last year at the very least . 
  when it comes to love it goes something like this : lithuania -  latvia -  estonia -  finland -  vodkka & sauunna . 
  i 'd say if we allied germany , lithuania and lithuanians would quite likely not exist today regardless of who would 've won . 
  yea , we did get taught about it too . 
  nazis are not forgotten in literature either : http://www.lituanus.org/1974/74_4_01.htm, 
  where does this map originate from even ? 
  slow in no way translates into dumb when it comes to eesti , belarus vassals ? 
  should be blank space for more accuracy . 
  i prefer this one http://i.imgur.com/dfhphnz.jpg edit : or this one : http://i.imgur.com/is8nrup.jpg, 
  well the [ sex ed book ] ( http://www.sena.lt/namai_seima_sveikata/zalytis_janis-meiles_vardu/763210 ) from soviet era that i 've read as a kid quite clearly outlined homosexuality as mental illness so there 's that . 
  `` he was a simple student until one day he was bitten by a pole and he became pole-man ! '', 
  ( kinda like spider-man ), 
  bathory 's heritage, 
  some people just took the `` go west '' song too literally . 
  this could totally pass for a black metal video : http://youtubedoubler.com/ivzq, 
  pessimism and frowning faces - eastern eu in a nutshell . 
  mountains are fucking awesome though . 
  this guy is tick 's wet dream . 
  maybe they want to produce john paul iii, 
  ca n't recall ever hearing someone mention ` slavs ' irl , russians are russians , poles are poles , serbs are serbs etc. 
  pretty much . 
  while youth has rather low participation in elections . 
  although last elections numbers got a lot better for youth participation , hopefully we 'll see a great increase this year as well . 
  they swore an oath and took the yellow , their watch has now begun . 
  he 's been a president of lithuanian basketball federation since 2011 , recently reelected and will continue to be such at least until 2020 . 
  does it resemble some finnish word ? 
  [ super hype ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/lithuania-rising-food-prices-spark-cauliflower-revolution ) they also got [ arvydas sabonis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arvydas_sabonis ) to be their [ ad face ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nll4zz7.jpg ) . 
  prices seem low , there 's a bunch of folks that despise current supermarket leaders for high prices that go to shop in poland , now they 'll shop in lidl lithuania i suppose . 
  unleash pensioners !!!!, 
  fwiw , looks fairly neat for a lidl shop . 
  20/28 [ ooooooh you !, 
  oh absolutely , i do agree , but majority vote was the way it was and the ship has sailed by now . 
  have n't really heard anything of nuclear power plant being built in kaliningrad yet . 
  we were supposed to build a new nuclear power plant ourselves but people voted against it in referendum so not really sure where 's the hypocrisy if people of today 's lithuania are against nuclear power plants . 
  just fyi , it takes into account bands that are n't active anymore as well . 
  how come tilsit is called sowetsk but klaip\u0117da is memel or gdansk - danzig ? 
  they were n't . 
  i kinda thought it was a fad that came in either during soviet times or even earlier . 
  think i recall my grandparents having one back in a day . 
  certainly not been a thing for a long while now , maybe you could find some grannies still sporting one . 
   laugh at poverty of russia we do n't , ordinary people being poor is not a laughing matter , oligarchs and politicians do n't suffer from it . 
  important to note also that only 26 % of respondents considered poland hostile nation , hardly was a majority view . 
  just that considerably less than before people rated poland as friendly . 
  not danger but hostility of a country . 
  in 2006 poland was deemed second most friendly country then in 2014 as second most hostile . 
  but then if we look at [ this ] ( http://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/eu28-poll-feb-16-full-data-tables.pdf ) ( pdf file , 2016 survey ) you 're rated pretty favorably again and not many other countries gave you similar scores . 
  so facebook status * it 's complicated ? 
  yea , pretty normal thing over there . 
  tons of ketchup or other similar lame sauce on pizza too . 
   ) i kinda consider it a heresy but am too lazy to cook normal meals often . 
  eh , is it really that bad ? 
  last [ survey ] ( http://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/eu28-poll-feb-16-full-data-tables.pdf ) ( pdf file ) on how favorably you rate a country lithuanian respondents gave you median 67.63 score out of 100 which was one of the highest scores you 've got . 
  so at the very least i 'd say you 're not universally hated by us . 
  it 's to the east of estonia , have a visit sometime !, 
  no , belarus can not into basketball . 
  yea , i 'd think so too but that 's how this article describes him , hence the laugh from my part . 
  hahaha , antanas guoga - the closest thing parliament has to a donald trump . 
  i do certainly think we do get more mentions when it comes to russia related news in this sub but are probably referred to as baltics or eastern europe in the title . 
  other than that , not really much is getting posted that 'd be specific to one of these countries so that it 'd call for name in the title of a post . 
  wayyy too much russia . 
  like blackberry priv ? 
   belarus gudija that name kept fading during soviet times and today does n't really get used much anymore , gudija is now commonly referred to as baltarusija so pretty much like in every language . 
  who needs comedians when we have politicians ? 
  iceland maybe ? 
  never been there but sounds very attractive : i prefer colder climates generally , landscape is very different to what i 'm used to so would provide a nice refreshing change for my eyes . 
  low population density so lots of uninhabited area to wander around . 
  high standard of living certainly does n't hurt either . 
  ha , take that turkey !, 
  while i really liked ukraine 's song and am glad they won , we 'd be better off without our jury .
