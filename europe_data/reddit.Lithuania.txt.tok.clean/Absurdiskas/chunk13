  they go full politics on russia second time in row which is insulting to our voters . 
  not to mention that it 's a lot more interesting to see what people vote for one by one rather than jury anyway . 
  i do n't think ww2 themed entry would bring germany better eurovision results . 
  lots of referendums in minority majority areas ; , 
  the commonwealth shall rise again !, 
  ooooooh man what and ending !, 
  baltic circle jerk broken by australia !, 
  oh latvia , what a wonderful taste you have !, 
  these backing singers of jedward ai n't the worst . 
  austria for miss universe !, 
  shhhh you !, 
  extra points for conforming to mustached polish man stereotype . 
  okay okay , you 'll get 12 points total but not more !, 
  k , thanks . 
  first thought that pops to mind is french , most certainly does n't sound anything like russian . 
  any example vid to listen to ? 
  poland soft !, 
  two best friends embark on a quest to find some hunny . 
  http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/02/14501/ there 's a whole bunch of pdf files at the bottom of the page with stats related . 
  i used `` eu28 - full data tables '', 
  sweden , denmark , netherlands are n't the biggest fans probably not enjoying their bikes getting stolen after all !, 
  oddly enough all three baltic states get lowest scores from portugal + greece , no idea what 's up with that , do n't think they even ride bikes much . 
   baltic boys man , that totally needs to be a real boy band name . 
  in general our top 5 most favored : 1 . 
  sweden ( 79.46 ) 2 . 
  finland ( 78.43 ) 3 . 
  united states of america ( 76.24 ) 5 . 
  austria ( 75.75 ) romania least favored eu member ( 47.63 ) . 
  us most favored country between lithuanians in 18-24 age group , this group likes southerners more while for the most part liking everyone a bit less and italy makes it into top 3 . 
  either way , no country that likes us more than we like them . 
  i feel like good amount of liths tend to like russia 's entries too , add some minority voting and voila . 
  oh that totally stole my heart unexpectedly < 3, 
  this confirms it , we 're by far the most relevant nation to ourselves . 
  i 'll take it as a win . 
  https://youtu.be/up6cahy8cji?t=4m44s btw , i looked into it a bit closer : -1 for russia due to prussia . 
  and +5 to poland due to poles . 
  so 34 vs 33 . 
  polan wins silver . 
  lietuva , most relevant best catholic , taip . 
  nah , but seriously , neo ** lith ** ic does n't count . 
   i used to be able to buy a whole full bag of groceries for 10 ltl nooo way . 
  50-70lt i 'd say . 
   they even went as far as to call this boycott being sponsored by the kremlin certainly the most hilarious thing to come out of this so far . 
  lidl is about to open up [ quite a few shops ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1ffjxsjpx3dnx3thsgih3r_7hgio ) so seems like they 're in to take a good chunk of market share . 
  liths also buy building materials from poland . 
  have read an interview with manager of some shop in suwalki branch , he kept wondering wtf are we building there that there 's so many orders . 
  just our way of investing into eastern poland . 
  meanwhile [ poland after lithuanians ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a7mjgdd.jpg ), 
  should we send them a letter ? 
  i 'm somewhat guessing that it was more due to repeating `` gas the jews '' ad nauseum . 
  well , as the saying goes `` svarbu ne \u016bgis , o sm\u016bgis . '', 
  - it 's not the height that matters but how hard you can hit , 
  it 's pretty normal , i 'm guessing you 're around average then . 
  map for [ females ] ( http://www.averageheight.co/average-female-height-by-country ), 
   life is n't a basketball game . 
  it kinda is , or at least that 's what a priest once said in funeral i attended . 
  - she played a good game but now is her time to sit on bench . 
  lith : [ 181.3 - men , 167.5 - female ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15830586?dopt=abstract ) . 
  seems rather low but personal bias i suppose . 
  nothing in particular , just generally positive feeling like seeing sunshine i suppose . 
  yeah , how the stores look varies quite a bit some look quite nice to me , some look horrendous . 
  but overall , let 's just say we 've had worse looking store chains . 
  regarding lithuanian wages - same here , the pay is low even by our standards , staff gets overworked etc. 
  working in maxima is sort of a swear word . 
  as in if a student wants to say his degree is useless he 'll say he 'll have to go to work in maxima after graduation . 
  [ higher education - everything 's considered ] ( http://www.diena.lt/sites/default/files/styles/940x000/public/img640964.jpg?itok=hynr1maa ) now employees unable to speak estonian , that 's news to me , certainly something that 'd piss me off as a client for sure . 
  :'( 10 more maximas for you !, 
  same here more or less , \u010cigonai , rumunai . 
  pc term is of course romas ( singular ) for gypsy but that poses a bit of a problem since romas is decently common lithuanian male name . 
  while there 's no suggestions for ireland , there 's one for irish :  why many irish left the homeland and now are returning ? 
  stork - kle kle kle kle !, 
  [ 2016 survey ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ioo7e7z.png ) an improvement , yay !, 
  nothing much was said , armed with a knife mid-aged man intruded into japanese embassy 's territory , acted aggressively and shouted to invite our president . 
  police got him quickly . 
  i 'd imagine just some druggie on a bad trip . 
  yeah , he has laikykites ten show for lithianian audience about our internal politics and decided to try branching out a bit . 
  define `` nice '' i personally prefer a city life so i do n't really want a house and new flats are fairly affordable even to folks with a bit higher than average salary as long as they don ' t have kids before buying one . 
  it 's even cheaper to buy one than to rent . 
  me and my friends do travel for vacation once in a while , cheap airlines ftw . 
  why would i leave my fatherland for few more euros ? 
  more expensive car wo n't make me any happier . 
  mykolas te\u0161lius you mean ? 
   i can understand like ~ 90 % of written lithuanian opened up delfi.lv comments and i found them funny and not cancerous at all , which confirms that i ca n't understand squat in written latvian . 
  the only odd thing here is that romania has 4.61 mil employed persons . 
  seems way too small for a country that size . 
  based on what ? 
  currently it 's not even on [ m-1 top 40 anymore ] ( http://www.m-1.fm/topai/top40 ) it used to be very popular last year though . 
  currently [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1xodnk1iha ) would be most popular lithuanian song right now , at least on radio . 
  so nice of you to shit on kaunas for no reason whatsoever . 
  irrelevant whether it 'll help with stopping smuggling or not , when trolls come off with shit like `` it wo n't stop tanks ! '', 
  and you reply explaining that it 's not meant to be you come off as someone who supports it being built big time while in reality may not care at all about it and just dislike random shit being spread . 
   look at the figures that 's not figures , that 's a picture . 
  i 've not seen much past explaining that it 's not meant for purposes that russian news claim it to be for . 
  like `` protecting against russian tanks '' or so `` lithuanians would n't flee to russia '' and it 's not a wall , but a simple fence ffs . 
  if it was up to reddit 's lithuanians conservatives + liberals would 've won by a landslide , now they 're in opposition . 
  i do n't recall our government making fun of him + there 's a new one in charge now anyway . 
  your mom 's a russian region . 
  the dude calls himself blue eyed blonde 69 what else can you expect . 
  red , placed at the bottom symbolizes communism that we 've left in the past so we could smoke weed and make shekels . 
  we 're the glass is half full of crap kind of people .
