  sounds like you have a. . . stockholm syndrome . 
  kinda hilarious how there 's an account solely for posting articles about e-residency . 
  talinnbots are at it again !, 
  it 's still aired on national broadcaster , ca n't watch it on their online stream though , no copyrights !, 
  that 's correct . 
  [ lithuanian leaflet , page 16 , pdf ] ( https://www.lidl.lt/statics/lidl-offering-lt/ds_doc/1_lidl_kainu_leidinys.pdf ), 
  yes , those names were very popular and are in top 10 most common lithuanian male names overall list [ source , pdf ] ( http://osp.stat.gov.lt/documents/10180/756286/popul_gyv_vardai_pavardes.pdf ) but these names fell out of fashion and now most popular baby names are as in op .

   is it related to the princess leia ? 
  dunno if popularity is related to princess leia , the name was at top 10 since 2013 but yeah , leia/leah we 'd say as l\u0117ja . 
   is it related to noah ? 
  yes , nojus = noah , reached it 's peak in 2008 placing third on the list .

  domantas, 
  i 'd imagine when it comes to immigrants from eastern states that 's gon na be quite a common haircut because that 's the type that most often emigrates . 
  no worries , since we now have peasants/greens in power we 'll be so renewably green that nords themselves will want to join the baltic club !, 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ then ^ ^ we 'll ^ ^ kick ^ ^ eesti ^ ^ out, 
  picture composed from male athletes has short hair , shocker !, 
  all cool , mate , that response is just angry copypasta , 
   we have a government agency called gus coll link , thx  fuck , we 're poor :( we are , but hey , remember that time when we kicked teuton 's ass ? 
  polish data ^ private ^ sector ^ only although i 'd imagine it 's tidbit higher overall as well . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but seems like your source is of some non governmental survey where most participants were young , educated , living in cities with more than 200k inhabitants . 
  we do have similar surveys and they 're usually quite a bit off from official data . 
  with that said that same page does n't seem to give any source for our median . 
  with that said , it 'd be interesting to see official polish data , if only for average salary but that it would include private + public sectors , the data i find in english only includes private sector . 
  fwiw , not looking to argue or anything , just general neighbourly curiosity , 
  that seems fairly similar to how many lithuanians feel and why they voted peasants . 
  funnily enough their leader also does n't take up any major positions in government and is full of funky ideas . 
   lithuania long ago have surpassed poland in income and households earn much more there . 
  [ oh ] ( https://youtu.be/vqxti--qcqg?t=1m53s ), 
  not a tea person i reckon !, 
  i do n't see why this one would be bad for us . 
  it 's not like over time we 'll start using english more and more and even start communicating with each other in it !, 
  to them it was just a one-hand stand !, 
  now brits on the other hand , they 're into commonwealths i 've heard !, 
  i imagine it may be [ drau\u010diai shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drau%c4%8diai_shooting ) . 
  not sure if that 's the one though . 
  greece was founded by lithuanian-sarmatians , duh !, 
  what you , a strong independent russian , can do in your daily life that is verboten for an ordinary romanian ? 
  of course , just like democratic people 's republic of north korea is full of democracy !, 
  no such thing as baltic race . 
  i suppose it 's important to point out that the numbers are made up . 
  like there 's a difference !, 
  because winter is coming and we know what 's coming with it , duh !, 
  previous government passed a law that 'd allow for freezing unlimited number of embryos , peasants ai n't having any of it because `` it 's life '' . 
  same peasants have raising fertility rate up to 2.1 in their program . 
   and beer [ come over here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/barlo1r.jpg ) , we 'll have a little friendly talk about the downfalls of alcoholism . 
  estonia did move ministry of education to tartu back in 2001 , not sure if it had any sort of benefits though . 
  it 's not impossible that peasants would break down at some point either , it 's basically a party of people with very different views , on one side pretty reasonable people on the other side `` stds - god 's punishment '' types . 
  yes , they 'd like to move em to kaunas , it 's not a new idea , been proposed and shot down before but peasants so far seem to be more determined to do it . 
  what 's with your obsession about hair and eyes ? 
  ash brown hair - very common , brown eyes - fairly rare . 
  overall , with all the other facial features she 'd totally pass for lithuanian . 
   the fear exists only in the titles of media outlets . 
  i kinda agree , media is way over exaggerating as usual . 
  like [ this ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lithuania-pm-iduskbn13h133 ) . 
  that was n't even major topic during elections and in his speech either , fixing demographics , more attention to regions , education , anti-corruption , better relations with polska etc , naaaah instead pick one thing about defense spending that was done deal long time ago and report it as if it 's key issue . 
  average price at 8,5 eur/m \u00b2 . 
  filtered through current proposals for exactly 25m \u00b2 apratments i get the average price of 244 eur . 
  iceland has most r/europe subscribers per 1k country 's population as well as far as i recall . 
  not aware of such rules either , but having such surname would probably cause quite a few inconveniences to the bearer . 
  there 's a proposition right now for a more convenient solution , writing it in both languages in passports , so it 'd be written as : toma\u0161evski / tomaszewski . 
  against : bronis rop\u0117 , rolandas paksas , valdemar tomasevski enough said , only weird that uspaskich voted for . 
  fwiw , in our defense , he only went batshit crazy after becoming a president , which did n't [ last long ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rolandas_paksas )  well now after a bit of a laugh i 'll go back to praising our polish king and savior jesus christ . 
  it 's not easy going back to feudal times . 
  well , at least kremlin seems to fear the catholic cross like the devil so you 've got that going for ya !, 
  it 's the party of [ this loon ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2003/world/europe/03/14/offbeat.lithuania.rasputin.reut/ ) so what can you expect . 
  order and justice is a joke these days . 
  i 'm more worried about possible trojan horses in peasants and greens party . 
  we 'll soon see i suppose . 
  [ 100 % glorious ] ( https://i.redd.it/g1lbvlirvbux.png ), 
  swedes would be like 35 % of population so of course we would oppress them by taking away their mansplaining hotline . 
  it 'd be fun !, 
  oh lol , dugin quoting jones . 
  will [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuvwo4annkg] ( this guy ) do ? 
  heard he 's looking for a job !, 
  as a retaliation we 'll feature polish death camps on our passports . 
  seems like there 's not been much decline in cities within 25-34 group within last few years and a recent increase so that may also be having an impact , people in that group usually start families and are looking to buy . 
   yay for emigration ? 
  we have that too , yet the real estate prices keep rising . 
  be visible !, 
  gddamn swedes stole our cannons and made ikea furniture out of em !, 
  was there like a bunch of noise about german deployment in lithuania or is it something else that made them go up in chart ? 
  you mean as in renovated ? 
  if so then far from it , renovation only kicked off in like 2013 or so with focus being on the least energy efficient buildings and small towns , big cities get fairly low number of projects a year when compared to smaller towns . 
  100 or even 200 euros for heating seems rather ridiculous . 
  \u0160ilainiai is full of commieblocks and the average for heating seems to go somewhere between 0.66 and 0.88 euros per square meter . 
  if you compare cheapest products in maxima and lidl it probably wo n't be any cheaper in the latter one but there are other benefits , like not being tricked into buying more expensive product because it 's on discount while you 're perfectly fine with the cheaper one . 
  and the lack of choice of different brands is a blessing to me , as now i do n't have to wait angrily as my wife ponders on which brand of bread to choose from . 
  shopping is easy and quick now . 
  yeah , sweden , finland were mentioned a lot during pre-election debates as a sort of easy out . 
  in short , people have elected anti alcohol crusaders and what passed is fairly mild to what they were planning before elections , like only selling alcohol in specialized , government owned stores .
