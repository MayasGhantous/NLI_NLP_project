  regarding obesity , i did not even suspect we might be top 5 or 6 in europe until very recently . 
  i 'd say it 's mostly older people letting go after having children coupled with very high calory diet . 
  good thing soda consumption is low or we 'd be the fattest in eu . 
  young folks generally do n't seem to be fat . 
  and since i mentioned pil\u0117nai : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3sx9u29m74, 
  that 's just one of the side effects of democracy and freedom ^ ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ ^ yeah 8 - ), 
  no worries !, 
  [ found one !, 
  oh yeah , i 'm aware . 
   our latvian buddy may have been confused though , dunno . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sibvdy7bi0 ) should qualify as super liked underground . 
  yea , samogitian feels closest to latvian . 
  not really many people talk proper samogitian these days which i found barely understandable . 
  although samogitians being stubborn as always their dialect is probably the strongest one remaining . 
  oh i 'm sure you would !, 
  yea , did n't expect you 'd understand , more so wanted to know whether it sounds better with some sort of regional dialect rather than `` standard lithuanian '' . 
  it 's not hate but perception of unfriendliness , 23 % ai n't that much given rather loud anti putin rhetoric , lt president calling russia terrorist state and all . 
  eh , do n't have to be latvian to be infuriated by that rap . 
  :d better ? 
  latvia : bestest of the best brothers . 
  belarus : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnlu_8h9noi poland : tymbark and kubus !, 
  eh , never been to great at giving compliments !, 
  i do n't think it 's fair that the first few can capitalize on shitposting , leaving nothing to the rest . 
  it should not be this way . 
  it should be based on simple and fair principle - from each according to his shitposting ability , to each according to his shitposting needs . 
  soo , looking at [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vw9rdwh.png ) ( 2010 data ) it would seem like now you dislike almost everyone else either a bit more or a lot more . 
  okay . 
  oh fuck , indeed . 
  was fooled by that other sources posted it as well . 
  goddamit , estonia - best enjoyed slowly would 've fit em so well !, 
  baltic circle jerk intensify !, 
  i thought [ this ] ( http://en.delfi.lt/lithuania/freetime/baltic-states-to-use-their-mutual-indistinguishability-to-their-advantage.d?id=70864178 ) was rather nice gesture . 
  it this english ? 
  it 's just a / r/polandball thing , do n't take it seriously . 
  we use the word as well , it 's not really some horrible insult in on itself i 'd say , more so have negative historical connotations that 's all . 
  probably `` brute '' would be somewhat decent translation . 
  russians seem to translate it into douchebag . 
  not we but good guy poland . 
  although we also of course punish those who spread hate speech etc , fines mostly for internet comments directed at some ethnic group . 
  a blessing in disguise , once the dust is settled and everyone 's wiped out it will be up to romania to repopulate the earth . 
  oh shut up , the dutch have spoken , you 're poland now . 
  well that was quick !, 
  i suppose we 're good then . 
  as the saying goes , if pole offers to pay you in unborn dead polish fetuses you take the deal . 
  still you can get greater deals in smaller shops , ~ 4.50 eur for 1kg of smoked , high quality meat ( de\u0161ra ) is hardly something you 'd find in maxima . 
  that 's the thing , there 's plenty of small butcher shops/bazars etc that offer high quality products much much cheaper than maxima and co but somehow they do n't get as much attention as polish ones . 
  goddamit polen , stop it with this polonization of our ~ ~ nobles ~ ~ industry !, 
  oh man i can envision the shitstorm it 'd cause . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://i.imgur.com/s5cd01x.gif ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://i.imgur.com/pgha8or.gif ) that second one looks like a scene from the office . 
  our people are n't exactly sitting on welfare there either . 
  we know more than enough , he worked with our troops as a translator , learned the language which was n't really necessary ( and very hard ) , soldiers say good things about him . 
  and yeah , i 'm inclined to believe his life is in danger , people who work with nato soldiers are n't exactly loved by various terrorist groups . 
  lithuania ai n't exactly a welfare state , you have two options here : you either work or work hard . 
  it is very popular in lithuania as well , second or third . 
  here 's how it sounds : https://youtu.be/fioq_3majrs?t=8s, 
  what 's the context ? 
  i thought your government already refused to take in any more refugees . 
  ooooooh , okay then . 
   murza gervaldas , it 's gervaldas now !!!, 
  poor thing actually thought changing a surname would make people take him more seriously . 
  when it comes to private houses it 's mandatory on : * day of restoration of the state of lithuania * day of restoration of independence of lithuania * coronation day of king mindaugas, 
  that 's pretty cool , did n't know - wicz would be belarusian . 
  it 's 16 not 14 in lithuania . 
  so keep yer dirty paws away from children !, 
  if you add - is ending that sounds very lithuanian , here 's your problem . 
  i do n't see any benefit for russia letting in a large poor country with backwards cultural attitudes . 
  now now comrade , do n't be suka . 
  for our black metal comrades out there !, 
  our mafia guys back in 90s reeaally really loved this song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpzah5u5xgg, 
  what 's vytis if not lenin riding on a horse to communism !, 
  finally we can blet have world [ peace ] ( https://i.imgur.com/otosfy5.jpg ) !, 
  i never though i 'd have to say this but that makes perfect sense and i 'm happy that it happened . 
  holy fuck you almost gave me heart attack !, 
  i wonder whether polish people would generally support such ban not . 
  okay okay , just do n't put me into kantcentration camp !, 
  soon ^ ^ ^ tm, 
  yea , i love proper winter but winter months that looked more like extended autumn were rather depressing this year . 
  goddamn german niceys are at it again !, 
   / r/animalporn ooooookay then . 
  their reporting from war zones is rather good imo . 
  but other than that seems rather biased . 
  oh yes , absolutely great weather today as opposed to almost always being cursed with rain whenever going for bbq . 
  maybe they should get rid of them , say give it away to other allied countries that would take good care of em . 
  well yeah , burzum - burzum , or burzum - dunkelheit http://www.burzum.org/eng/discography/official/1996_filosofem.shtml, 
  gon na open up [ shashlik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shashlik ) season . 
  eh i was about to say something about varg taking a trip to finland . 
  might be , i 'm not really sure on how widespread the usage of morning after pill is in poland . 
  but then there 's also that one of these groups does want to have children while the other does not . 
  by halting state funded ivf ? 
  but steve jobs mate . . why wo n't you let in future jobses ? 
  man i love those `` i '' letters in belarusian and ukrainian . 
  well australia is already in esc , do n't see why us should n't be in as well !, 
  non-paywalled : http://www.baltictimes.com/europe_must_declare_war_on_terrorists_-_grybauskaite/, 
   it is 400 times higher risk to die in a traffic accident . 
  not for me , i drive volvo . 
  well now , let 's not downplay the whole refugee crisis in lithuania . 
  not two , but all four of them !, 
  apparently he sent a letter to the speaker of our seimas expressing concert over the situation of refugees in our country , encouraged us to be patient , welcoming and open our home doors to them . 
  funny guy . 
  our beloved eastern european neighbours .
