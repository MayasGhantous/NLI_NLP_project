  suicidal thoughts intensify . 
  the question was about the looks not originality . 
  so let 's put it this way , out of the sea of blonde models yours is the pretties one to me . 
  looks serious , neither too dull neither too bright . 
  dunno really , just always loved it without giving it much thought . 
  i suppose third colour does it for me . 
  i like the flag of iceland more than other nordic cross flags too . 
  shut up backward monaco !, 
  best : serbia , norway , germany . 
  worst : belarus , cyprus . 
   we need to become baltic israel very fast . 
  oh one can dream but there 's no real capability of doing so . 
  5.8 % russians which is sure , less than poles ( 6.6 % ) but as you can see not by all that much . 
  8 % out of all population are native russian speakers but not necessarily ethnic russians . 
  i certainly ca n't compare it to latvia and estonia because i 'm not really sure what 's the situation like in there but since you mentioned baltic states and we are one i felt like clarifying what 's the situation like in lithuania . 
  yeah , but you see those `` some '' are always there regardless of if you 're russian in lithuania , pole in germany , hispanic in us or whatever . 
  and the percentage of such folks is rather small in comparison . 
   also , i think you will agree that with the amount of bs in the last 2 years - it would not be surprising to see a massive drop in people who view russians negatively . 
  in 2015 opinions of lithuania 's russians got worse for 26 % respondents and improved somewhat/improved greatly for 38 % . 
  ( no change/opinion for remaining ) generally opinion seems to be improving yearly as people do n't associate the actions of russian government with that of people living in our country . 
  last time i saw a survey results get published ~ 80 % of ethnic lithuanians shared positive views of our russian minority . 
  now i ca n't find that one , but this [ pew research report ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2009/11/02/chapter-6-opinions-of-ethnic-and-religious-minorities/ ) shows 17 % of lithuanians having negative view of russian minority . 
  so roughly same as polish views on lithuanians and much much better than russia 's views of us . 
  sure it 's a bit dated , but it certainly did n't get worse . 
  a wise woman she is !, 
  20 % ai n't that bad given what a hateful bunch generally gathers in comments section if you read delfi or such . 
  we 're not that religious . 
  [ religious commitment ] ( https://i.imgur.com/mw9fda1.png ) and [ importance of religion by age ] ( https://i.imgur.com/qnqhpde.png ) that 's as far as i recall from 2009 , done by pew research . 
  so hostile they give 40 % more funding for their education than for ethnic lithuanians . 
  so oppressed that they emigrate less than poles from poland or lithuanians from lithuania . 
   i understand this is some local thing ai n't that a thing in poland as well ? 
  hmm , same gdp ppp as latvia , similar name endings , has eternal danger neighbour and another neighbour that likes to call themselves a name related to greeks . 
  greece broliukas confirmed !, 
  contractions from the cold !, 
  yea , that 'll be on saturday . 
  here 's pic from [ last year ] ( https://i.imgur.com/djvfwuu.jpg ), 
  haha , yeah , this has been going on for a while now . 
  even my sister went there with husband a few times to see what 's all the fuss about . 
  elections are coming up this year and this got a lot more attention after an article published about masses of lithuanians spending their time on march 11 ( day of restoration of independence ) shopping in poland . 
  the opposition was outraged and blamed the current government and whatnot ( they were in charge previously at time of crisis fwiw and that 's when this began ) . 
  given that it 's election year i 'd guess it 's likely this will come to fruition . 
  well how would i know how much of it is truth , i did not live to see it . 
   i do believe it is accepted as such . 
  the documentary aired in 2005 on tv3 channel . 
  imo it 's best not to dwell on such things . 
  oh mate , in description link for more info leads to :  \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 , 
  well [ you know . . ] ( https://i.imgur.com/klkgeky.png ), 
  i have no emotional attachment to the subject . 
  and if you consider it a disorder then you too have to look at other disorders such as borderline personality disorder and how it impacts children , highly doubt that having two dads/moms would be worse than that yet one is fine the other is big no no . 
  not necessarily , homosexuals can and do have children if they so desire by pairing up with other homosexual couples of opposite sex . 
  they can and do help out couples where one of the partners is infertile too . 
  acceptance of homosexuality in society can possibly be beneficial to fertility rates as people wo n't start turning gay just because homosexuality is accepted if they are not gay to begin with , but the practices i mentioned earlier could become more widespread . 
  good guy latvia , took one for the team . 
  fuck off with this nonsense . 
  oh , okay then . 
  well , the good news seems to be that your happiness has risen , so there 's that at least !, 
  so seems like greeks are the least happy out of eu member states now having experienced biggest decrease in happiness in recent years . 
  makes sense i suppose . 
  poor folks . 
  otoh , latvia has biggest increases in happiness in eu . 
  and i can into stryczeku !, 
  well , that was fun . 
  last year we had 31968 births as opposed to 30369 in 2014 . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://osp.stat.gov.lt/web/guest/statistiniu-rodikliu-analize?portletformname=visualization&amp;hash=9ae2e698-f7df-4535-9385-ec878852035e ) on the other hand , so far since new year until beginning of this month there 's 6877 less lithuanians in lithuania as opposed to 5574 less in previous year for same time period . 
  [ 2 ] ( http://osp.stat.gov.lt/web/guest/statistiniu-rodikliu-analize?portletformname=visualization&amp;hash=f201640d-ef5e-421d-bed9-845eb20e505e ) but then again , 6969 births in last few months as opposed to 6039 last year same time period . 
  [ 3 ] ( http://osp.stat.gov.lt/web/guest/statistiniu-rodikliu-analize?portletformname=visualization&amp;hash=cdc90d9c-f8a1-4964-9ce5-dc01d5f75a10 ) sooo yeah , it 's cool that births are on the rise , but we got ta find a way to lower emigration asap or we 'll soon sing `` two million '' . 
  stop spamming your channel , goddamit . 
  who are they ? 
  not your average jonas that 's for sure . 
  he may not use the term to refer to us as such , but that 's because we can identify ourselves as lithuania/baltic state while only lumping up `` the west '' into one group . 
  nope , i 'm as lithuanian as it gets neither majority of my friends are russian ( i do have a few though , but besides the accent they are just as lithuanian ) , no idea how that 'd be relevant though . 
  as for connection with poland , it may not feel like it while we 're in lithuania . 
  once you meet one in actually different culture ( say italy or w/e ) you certainly begin to notice and appreciate the similarities . 
  or at least i do . 
  do people irl genuinely care about being referred to as ee or is this just internet circlejerk ? 
  if former then lol , [ get on our level , lads ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab9c0klyilw ) . 
  glamour may be over for some of us but as long as west is significantly richer than the east there 'll be no shortage of folks looking up to it regardless of their policies , imho . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  luckily we did not have such cases yet as far as i could recall . 
  jesus that 's infuriating . 
  good to know that as long as you 're supposedly under 15 you can go and murder anyone in cold blood in sweden . 
  hm , that 's a long video to confirm something that could 've been done in like [ one picture ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wztbykr.jpg ), 
  i 'm sure some estonian will clarify and expand on it further , but yes , i would say that should absolutely give you a pretty good life there . 
  avg wage in estonia is ~ 870 euros . 
  romania is possibly the cheapest one and has great internet speeds . 
  not sure about coverage though , but should be no problem living in a city i assume . 
  baltic states are on the cheaper end of the spectrum as well ( more expensive than romania ) and has great internet speeds/coverage as well . 
  lithuania being the cheapest one followed by latvia then estonia . 
  no idea about bulgaria , cheaper than baltic states though . 
  poland is also pretty cheap and a nice country overall . 
  now of course union ai n't happening and we 're only talking what ifs but language is n't really a problem . 
  everyone 's bilingual anyway and can communicate with each other freely , being in bilingual country does n't destroy language either as history shows , not even if there 's attempts of doing that forcefully . 
  and us valuing our languages so much only means there 's even less threat to it as there would be measures in place to preserve em . 
  i suppose . 
  would n't be much of joining up , more like joining into polan though given our huge size difference . 
  twins would be belarus imo , but they dyed their hair red and went away to live with big boy russia . 
  then there 's brothers/allies . 
  bros with no issues - latvia . 
  big bro poland , status - it 's complicated . 
  as for joining up into one country , like there 's anyone who would ever want to do that with us .
