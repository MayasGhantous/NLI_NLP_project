  beautiful . 
  women . 
  i can never tell when someone is joking on this or not . 
   i bet there 's some soviet legacy :3 yes comrade !, 
  the potholes of course !, 
  if government gives you potholes , make a [ pond out of it ] ( http://www.boredpanda.com/photo-shooting-on-road-pits/ ), 
  jailing minorities you say ? 
  http://forvo.com/search/ramus/cs/ sounds like most would pronounce ram\u016bs this way . 
  calm like belgians . 
  heh , there was an attempt to sell the scent of lithuania few years ago , i did not try it but since our entrepreneurs say it smells like lithuania , so it must be the case !, 
   the scent is a heady mix of bergamot , wild flowers , ginger , raspberry and grapefruit , with base notes of amber , cedar , sandalwood , patchouli and , intriguingly , `` tree moss and tree smoke '' . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/01/lithuania-perfume-scent-lietuvos-kvapas think there was a fair bit of ridicule about that . 
  as far as i remember , not the first case of danish teen girl being converted into islam and doing some atrocious things . 
  i wonder if there 's been similar cases elsewhere in europe being reported ? 
  he should eat less red meat , drink more water and add some fruits to his diet . 
  not really feeling it , mate . 
  i think you guys had some other flag that had some motives which were used for centuries in most european cultures . 
  that would probably be more appropriate . 
  i am very glad to hear that , especially coming from our olden bros. 
  thank you and cheers , mate !, 
  [ too much ? 
  http://www.investlithuania.com/lets-talk-lithuania/business-environment/ internet is everywhere , high speed and dirt cheap . 
  can confirm , never gave a bribe to anyone ever nor were lead to believe that i should . 
  otoh , small towns still have it to some extent afaik . 
  well , there 's more to that than just education level . 
  for one , it 's a fun adventure . 
   also you get much better at english which is very valuable skill to have these days . 
  studied abroad on foreign exchange myself . 
  http://en.aruodas.lt/ is catch-all site . 
  ( for lithuania ) ober-hous is pretty good real estate agency and has plenty of offers . 
  i do n't think it 's only lack of sex-ed that [ halts procreation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9g9jgly.gifv ), 
  it 's ai n't too bad . 
  ** baltic states ** population : ~ 6.2 mil area : 175k km ^ 2 ** sweden ** population : ~ 9.8 mil area : 450,3 k km ^ 2 ** finland ** population : ~ 5.4 mil area : 338k km ^ 2 ** norway ** population : 5.2 mil area : 385k km ^ 2 so we 're still more populous than most nords excluding denmark , those crazy rabbits . 
  better than whatever we 'll send , but i liked last year 's eesti entry more . 
  ^ maybe, 
  oh yeah , think i 've read about that building on our news . 
  good guy delfi , always writing cool stuff about polan . 
  :  anyway , this has been a shame of kaunas for what seems like eternity now : [ pic1 ] ( https://i.imgur.com/iqojtu9.jpg ) [ pic2 ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xouiaek.jpg ) [ pic3 ] ( https://i.imgur.com/9jlgees.jpg ) [ pic4 ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xfcg1ax.jpg ) works on it halted in 1993 when company that was building it ran out of funds . 
  in 2003 it was bought by lithuanians , two projects failed since then . 
  the second one due to financial crisis of 2008 . 
  but now another company finally bought it and are planning to demolish it and build a business center instead . 
  fingers crossed . 
  got ta be english with all the accents that can sometimes sound like different languages on their own . 
  i do quite like spoken russian too . 
  [ they 're okay i guess ] ( https://i.imgur.com/amasyra.jpg ) . 
  i suppose it 's not the worst thing if latvia gets turned into zhmundia and we get united zhmundi federation . 
  you can take em , but what victory would it be if in few generations all of your people would be turned into zhmundi ? 
  - get called nazi ss worshippers all year long by russians that ca n't tell apart lt from lv . 
  1.9 mil polish folks in zeh germany ? 
  that 'd be quite some change from 2014 data ( 674k ) or am i missing something ? 
  damn , these guys would wreak havoc on latvian sprats factory . 
  ohh boy . 
  [ who needs mistral when we 've got lokys ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ghdmkmk.jpg ), 
  polan , when ? 
  well john mccain of course . 
  and these mostly happen not because of disregard for the rules ? 
  drunk driving/speeding/not driving at safe distance/overtaking in forbidden places etc. 
  all of these are a consequence of people acting like assholes . 
  what you see in op is n't representing the amount of fender benders our diplomats do , but driving over speed limit/parking where they should n't etc. 
  being shit driver is way too easy excuse for that . 
  saying we 're chams i could get behind , shit drivers ? 
  what would lead you to such conclusion ? 
  what 's the reason for driving under speed limit in us ? 
  is speeding say 1mp/h over limit punishable ? 
  usa though . 
  well i think everyone felt all along that we had it too good and sooner or later they 'll get their hands on it . 
  doubt there 's anything to be done about it as too many people/corporations with actual power want it this way . 
   under the incoming tobacco products directive , `` e-cigarettes not licensed as stop-smoking medicines will be limited in size and strength fwiw , this worries me more actually . 
  [ kurva is kurwa ] ( https://translate.google.com/#lt/pl/kurva ) . 
  i do n't think there 's a difference in use . 
  kurva can be used to refer to someone as a whore or just in general as a reaction like : oi kurva kas \u010dia daros !, 
  ~ ~ kurwa ~ ~ you mean glorious lithuanian word kurva ? 
  from tatars . 
  or just raus . 
  sorry it happened to you . 
  i 'm afraid there 's not all that much that one could do . 
  even pepper spray is n't legal . 
  and tbh it would n't help out either when a state of shock sets in and you become somewhat paralyzed . 
  moving to safer area/country could set your mind at ease , but i 'd also urge you to attend self-defense lessons of some sort to prepare your mind for dealing with shock in case this ever repeated itself which i hope it wo n't . 
  k\u016bl . 
  poli\u0161 `` sz '' ykvals lifiueinijan '' \u0161 '' . 
  belarus is somewhat okay too , baltai = whites , belarus/baltarusija = white rus .

  ~ ~ annex ~ ~ - reunite with our long lost beloved brothers . 
  12 points from australia to lithuania in eurovision 2016 and we 'll strongly consider it !, 
  sorry mate , we 're scared of giant centipedes .

  * ldm, 
  he literally started same thread yesterday and the day before he started a thread with same text as in op . 
  i like how maxima creeped into belarus . 
  foreshadowing !,
