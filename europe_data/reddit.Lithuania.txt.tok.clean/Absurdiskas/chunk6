  although i 'm just guessing here . 
  oh , i just found same song with english subs , may be better listening experience i 'd assume , so here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngofstltlek [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cjewmh2qx8 ) is pretty good too if you 'll want something more cheery afterwards !, 
  satisfaction ? 
  in lithuania ?!, 
  how dare you,

  oh come on , guns are fun !, 
  well , at least we got one of those !, 
  i 'd prefer if we were more like switzerland or finland in this regard . 
  i 'm certain all eastern countries have plenty of delicious dishes with potatoes as main ingredient . 
  just yesterday i ate a whole bunch of potato pancakes stuffed with ground meat . 
  deliciousness overflow !, 
  half a kg of potatoes a day keeps the capitalism away !, 
  oh man , that 's some impressive potato consumption by belarus . 
  it 's the european way of life . 
  man , we 'd be pissed if we did n't get at least a declaration of triple extra profound concern . 
  not all that much in kaunas or at least it does n't make my eyes bleed . 
  seems to be more prevalent in vilnius . 
   but i am guessing that most of the russians in the baltics actually does not want to live in russia . 
  it is just a vocal nationalist minority . 
  yeah , in reality i do n't think that even narva would vote on leaving today . 
  russians for the most part like it in baltics and while they naturally hold sentiments for russia , they would n't want to live in it . 
  a bit over a year in currently . 
  not converting to litas any more regularly , but i do still sometimes make such conversion on bigger purchases or on something that seems more expensive than it was prior euro , like restaurant bill for example . 
  had to buy a different wallet as euros are larger and i do hate all the coins i now get to carry . 
  did n't love having lower digits in bank account either . 
  eastern europe starts with that country to the east of us . 
  - said every eastern european country . 
  when going to a strip club we bring a bag of potatoes with us and make it rain . 
   ukraine incident -  poland and baltics call for help -  uk responds and baltics is happy . 
  ukraine on the other hand ? 
  that does not impact them in any way thus they do not care . 
   the uk also sent trainers to ukraine . 
  now that yes , should influence ukrainian perception but as it seems from op it quite possibly went unnoticed by general public . 
  dude , of course we 're grateful about helping us out in baltics and all , but op is about how ukrainians view world leaders , not us . 
  of course helping us out had a positive impact on us and our views , but why would it have such impact in ukraine ? 
  seems yet again perfectly reasonable . 
  i wonder if we 'll see caricatures about that . 
  that 's great and all , but i really doubt your average citizen of ukraine cares much about isis and such right now . 
  we need to combine them both for a perfect 100 % score . 
   but the choice of apocalyptic music will be top notch . 
  disagree . 
  the lack of usage for inception style fog horn is really saddening . 
  haha . 
  well , to be fair , they still seem to like him more than americans themselves . 
  thanks !, 
  33 % qualifies you as underclass in norway and women do n't date down . 
  best you could get is someone with < 25 % purity . 
  so what did alleged erdogan answer at the end ? 
  it was n't translated .

  that 's like mine probably . 
  neither brown nor truly blonde . 
  pretty common in lithuania . 
  no it tastes like freedom !, 
  nothing is tastier than pig intestines stuffed with potato !, 
  nothing !, 
  oh how dare you ... 
  similar here although i 'd never spam mcd 's cheeseburgers as they 're inferior , only stuff like big n ' tasty can compete imo . 
  reflects in number of restaurants too hesburger - 44 vs mcd 's - 11 . 
  and now i 'm hungry . 
  yup , prisma is best , but only has mere 4 supermarkets open in lithuania so that 's a bummer . 
  sure they do , never tried one though . 
  megaburgers ftw !, 
  there 's more factors than that at play , but yes , i do believe that at the core of it it 's birth control as it enables those other factors to come into fruition .

  looking at the stats from 2014 even we do get a tiny number of migrants from south america so if that 's the case for us i 'll go ahead and guess that there indeed is a decent number of migrants in eu from those countries , but naturally the numbers will be much lower than those of citizens from countries with closer proximity . 
  and why is nationality of suspects is being reported now ? 
  while i do fully expect the actual numbers to be quite different what you 're saying is in no way true . 
  women have no trouble being open about it nor they get shamed into silence or whatever you people imagine . 
  i do n't know , man . 
  seems credible enough for me !, 
  see polan was right about bicyleta riders . 
  thanks for giving birth to true black metal !, 
  well you brought us delfi so we had to retaliate with maxima . 
  it 's only fair . 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  sutartin\u0117s are pretty distinct to us . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daina_ ( lithuania ) #sutartin . c4 .97 s and here 's some examples : [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeenhlrteia] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeenhlrteia ) [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbyn61kgaqa] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbyn61kgaqa ) [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ezpwdkorlc] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ezpwdkorlc ), 
  i can tell you 've never googled for asian porn . 
  you could 've at least attempted to express yourself in civilized manner . 
  yeah , and italian cook is mostly portrayed as a bit chubby moustached man . 
  so what ? 
  neither do i. 
  it 's no different than depicting italian as a cook . 
  i get a feeling that ce/ee countries generally do n't take jokes lightly that are made at their expense while westerners seem to be generally fine with it with maybe an exception of poorer southern european countries . 
  as for lithuania , well , mainstream humour has gone downhill in recent years sure there are attempts at laughing at stereotypes of marozai ( chavs ) incompetent policemen , villagers etc. 
  but i see it as poorly done , although many people seem to enjoy it . 
  in traditional jokes though , lithuanian always used to be the smartest guy of the bunch . 
  we do traditionally make fun a lot from our politicians and we do laugh that it 's so bad in lithuania that even people from war zones do n't want to go there . 
  but yet again , i do n't think that people would appreciate it if a foreigner said that . 
  [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iobum99etci] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iobum99etci ), 
  way cheaper to stuff oneself fully with kebab than with sushis so while sushi is definitely popular , it poses no threat of kebab removal in lithuania . 
   but now the rains weep o'er his hall ,  with no one there to hear . 
   yes , now the rains weep o'er his hall ,  and not a soul to hear . 
  that is unless you are some mediocre ice skater who begs for it on social media just to spit on it once she gets it . 
  for social workers ? 
  i do n't think anyone earns less than 350 after taxes . 
  my friend worked such job in kaunas , do n't recall exact salary but it was between 400-450 after taxes + bonuses , no prior experience .
