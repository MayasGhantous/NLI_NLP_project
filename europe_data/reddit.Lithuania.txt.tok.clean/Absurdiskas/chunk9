  as for giving up homes , one politician tried too hard in scoring brownie points by proclaiming [ `` our home is your home '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vmwynao.jpg ) , so people now like to joke around by saying that she has to take in all refugees into her house . 
  think it 's [ this again ] ( http://i.imgur.com/91sn32q.jpg ), 
  well , that 's an odd chain of self-replies . . 
  well , few days ago [ poland and romania pledged to forge closer ties ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/233841,poland-romania-pledge-to-forge-closer-ties ) and what 's a better way to unite two countries than shouting wilno nasze together !, 
  i forgot the excessive swearing in some of the movies , sounds cooler than in original language . 
  was still smallish kid but here it goes anyway : cookies that you could set on fire . 
  vhs player with american movies like rambo dubbed in funny russian voice or mtv music videos [ favourite of the time ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sezogw_z9w0 ) emergence of foreign cars [ car like this ] ( http://imgur.com/vskmakb ) seemed so freaking modern and sleek in comparison . 
  shameful diesel engine tho and everyone knows that diesel is for tractors !, 
  my view is positive towards nuclear energy . 
  however , in 2012 we held a referendum on whether people agree on building a new nuclear power plant and 62.7 % said no . 
  if you are running and estonian outruns you , means that you 're finnish . 
  nah , that used to be a big thing here too . 
  i do n't hear those jokes anymore now tho .

  [ monika linkyt\u0117 - po dangum ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2kgqv0hx7o ) was quite popular from songs that were released this year , took top1 in charts . 
  [ lilas ir innomine - karina ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eypndyqleoa ) also decently popular . 
  it 's not like ee does n't have homelessness . 
  vilnius being more expensive than tallinn , riga , warsaw seems a bit surprising . 
  what gives ? 
  heh , mandatory picture of refugee woman with a child surrounded by evil hungarians . 
  do n't really see hungary or any other country that strongly disagrees with quotas just suddenly changing their mind after some threats from the west . 
  and even if west manages to shove quotas down their throat . 
  is it really wise to send people to a country where nobody wants them ? 
  family doctors can prescribe it too . 
  but i 'd say to only take it as a last resort , heavy stuff . 
  lithuania ca n't into antidepressants ( hangs ), 
  not really a huge fan of the response . 
  `` hey justin . 
  look at us , we exist . '', 
  just does n't sound like something that representatives of any country should be doing . 
  otoh , maybe it 's just a plot for tonyg to get some easy hu action . 
  and you are free to feel that way same as ee is free to feel the way they do . 
   plus , many ee members have declining populations . 
  doubt that anyone in ee wants to solve that by importing people from completely different culture . 
  np , all we have to do is unite with latvia , belarus , ukraine and moldova to be on par with russia . 
  should be easy enough . 
  this is nothing new or specific to `` syrian refugees '' , asylum seekers always got some money so they would n't starve until they learn the language and become hire-able . 
  they have 6 months to do that . 
  i think that 's fairly reasonable stance by our government . 
  we 're not sweden , no one will come here for welfare . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ywdxijeksg ), 
  yeah , i would 've guessed farsi . 
  wow , eight ? 
  where do you live and how are you able to afford having so many children ? 
  maybe they slashed the benefits a bit too harshly but original proposal was n't good either as it would 've created a public backslash which would 've been bad not only for politicians but also for people in question . 
  as for poverty , it 's just a sad state many people live in , refugees wo n't be living in a big city so they should manage to get by . 
  maybe i misunderstood something ( article is n't in-depth ) but it seems all that changes are reactionary time for deletion of such content ? 
  and that only applies to germany . 
  you can report whatever you deem inappropriate on facebook etc now anyway and it should be reviewed so basically nothing much changes at all it seems . 
  haha , had a particularly good laugh at `` tired like latvian money '' by estonia and `` pretend to be greek '' by poland . 
  fwiw , we also call buffet `` swedish table '' . 
  [ kardiofonas - kal\u0117din\u0117 eglut\u0117 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5de95e2oo98 ), 
  does n't work against children under 13 and sure as hell wo n't work on teenagers . 
  it 's just a social experiment !, 
  we were taught we were as brothers too and i 'm sure i 'm not the [ only ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802dqaig0ws ) lithuanian who would like us to be that way again , but it 's certainly [ hard . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwae5z828bu ), 
  that 's certainly more expensive than this [ art installation ] ( https://i.imgur.com/drexlio.jpg ) ( 29k eur ) , but at least yours does n't make the place look worse . 
  in most places we have perfectly fine tap water so no real need to buy bottled . 
  sure , some people still buy it but nowhere near as much as in southern europe . 
  i 'll buy mineral water once in a while tho . 
  buying carbonated water in refillable siphons [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m5xdogx.jpg ) used to be very popular in the 90 's , but it 's been a long time since i 've seen one of those . 
  [ indeed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqxh900gbgo ), 
  we 're taking in refugees . 
  even managed to convince one family to come over so far !, 
  what makes you think that if all ee countries agreed to cooperate that the burden would be significantly reduced for the west ? 
  scrubbing ryan 's privates . 
  if there 's too many , it can be a problem too because there may be not enough jobs for them while at the same time there 's a lack of skilled tradesmen . 
  on all levels except physical i am american . 
  our president is single . 
   they could sit back and do nothing and america would still come to their rescue because they 're right up against russia . 
  maybe we could , does n't mean that we should . 
  we do n't want to be freeloaders . 
   if i was a lithuanian soldier i would n't want to risk my life in mali for france . 
  nah , i 'm sure there 's plenty of men who are hungry to see action . 
  yea , i did n't claim that greece is wealthy or anything , just that it 's not the poorest in eu . 
  ( lithuania is n't poorest either fwiw ) my original claim was that greek pensioners are better off than most working people here , which still holds true . 
  $ 883 pension vs $ 550 salary after taxes for a man and as you said yourself , pensioners usually already own their place , so no rent or mortgage which is n't the case for your average working person here . 
  i 'm well aware that it 's cheaper , that 's why i said it 's not ** that much ** more expensive to live in greece . 
  okay , so let 's take that 27 % cheaper to live in vilnius percentage . 
  average pension in lithuania $ 247 , average pension in greece $ 883 . 
  so you claim that because it 's a bit more expensive to live in greece , 257 % increase in pension does n't get you a better living there ? 
  i 've been to greece , it 's not that much more expensive at all comparing to lithuania . 
  so poor that pensioners get more a month than like 87 % of working people here . 
  that moment when your country is waaay below syria . 
  welp , at least we beat jamaica !, 
  we love game of thrones , bb and wait for star wars just as much as you do . 
   ever since soviets collapsed [ we 're all living in america ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8ljrgcjnm ) i think it had a negative impact overall on my country imo . 
  we still live in eastern europe , but with western hopes and dreams for life . 
   `` it was a mistake to include estonia to the eu . '' jfc , this makes me far more enraged than it should . 
  eu could really benefit from procreation campaign #comeinsideeurope, 
  [ river flows in you cover with kankl\u0117s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ravrullzcy ), 
  if it 's a man - shake hands . 
  if female - wave , smile , then run away crying . 
  the 100 year old man intrigued me . 
  the other two , had some funny bits , but the overall setting is hardly relatable which i speculate may be a bigger turn off for audience outside scandinavia than the humor itself . 
  looks cool . 
  would like to see some photos from up close so i could see what the guy at one of the top floors is browsing . 
  way closer culturally to russia than to turkey , for obvious reasons , but russian cultural influence is sharply declining and i really love kebabs . 
  haha , had it drawn , but decided to keep it light in the end . 
  lithuania is roughly 3 mil and latvia is 2 mil ,
