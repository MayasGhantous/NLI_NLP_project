  it was simple and old , but really clean and nice . 
  when we woke up in the morning , our jaws dropped . 
  there were mountain tops visible through the window , they were so close . 
  it was something amazing to us because the tallest hill in lithuania is not very big , less than 300 meters above sea level . 
  our damn soviet tv tower is taller . 
  heat lasted just a few days , got up to 31c , so not insanely hot . 
  however , we got some massive street-flooding rains . 
  three times in just two weeks , and reportedly we have n't had so much rain since the nineties . 
  in winter i wear warm fuzzy slippers . 
  in summer i 'm either barefoot or crocs . 
  are you new to reddit ? 
  asksomething type of subreddits are all about stories . 
  nobody cares if you just answer with `` yes '' , people want stories . 
  it applies equally to / r/askreddit , / r/askscience , / r/askhistorians , etc. 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/6rk4xj/did_arms_manufacturers_in_the_19th_and_early_20th/ ) is a good sample thread . 
  the question is `` did arms manufacturers in the 19th and early 20th centuries actually conspire to start wars , as popularly depicted ? '', 
  the answer could be a plain `` no '' yet the responders go into detail to explain the nuances . 
  that 's how reddit works . 
  people were expecting interesting stories , not just plain `` yes , no '' answers . 
  i 've never been to russia ( even though my uncle lives in moscow , i should go some day ) but i have been to ukraine . 
  i went to this little seaside town called skadovsk , grandparents of a friend live there , they offered us a room for a couple weeks . 
  two things left the biggest impression . 
  first , the taxis . 
  they do n't have meters or anything , you just tell the driver where you need to go and then you negotiate the price . 
  the cars were all old ladas , no exceptions . 
  the interesting thing was that they were luxury class ladas , maybe they 've been modified in some way because four of us fit on the back seat reasonably comfortably . 
  another thing were the jellyfish . 
  massive , stinging , blue jellyfish . 
  many were as big as a watermelon and they were everywhere in that gulf , because it was shallow and warm , so a perfect place for them to breed . 
  it was oddly satisfying when we were reversing out of port with a small boat and the boat 's propeller was chopping up those gooey creatures . 
  oh , and i saw some dolphins out in the sea , they were chasing our boat . 
  that 's an example of what op was looking for . 
  it 's complicated . 
  poland is very against russia but polish minorities in lithuania are n't the same as polish people in poland . 
  here they 're often hanging out with russians , it 's all mixed up , so it really depends on the person . 
  russians are mostly pro-soviet . 
  leader of the largest polish political party in lithuania is pro-russian , which is a good reason to hate him and everything he stands for . 
  we have the same problem in lithuania ( with polish minorities as well ) and the government 's been trying to convert russian-language schools into lithuanian ones for several years now . 
  it 's happening but it 's very slow , there 's a lot of criticism from both russia and certain polish politicians . 
  poland does n't really do anything beyond just a few statements , while russia is in an all-out info war . 
  they 're spreading propaganda , russian newspapers , leaflets , all sorts of advertising material with lots of false claims about eu/nato/lithuania , etc. 
  several medium-sized news sites have caved and started writing about the evils of eu and benefits of russia . 
  people fall for it because they 're afraid of losing their identity . 
  also , some are just dickheads . 
  i have a neighbour who ca n't say a word in lithuanian even though he 's been living here for 40 + years , got a wife , raised three kids and retired . 
  he does n't try intentionally , because he 's one of those people who still think that our independence is illegal and it should be russia here . 
  uh , i 've been to crimea several years ago , i guess it counts now ? 
  it was nice , sunny and cheap . 
  old soviet cars everywhere , kind of dirty , but the people were really nice . 
  i 've heard that it 's kind of a mess now ( how unexpected ) , neighbour brought over his relatives from there . 
  so far you 're the commenter with most experience , yet your answer is way beyond the worst i 've ever seen . 
  there are lots of edible ( and tasty ) mushrooms in baltic forests , so it 's a popular thing to do . 
   for some reason . 
  slavic languages share many words , so it would make sense . 
  '' \u012e sveikat\u0105 '' , meaning `` to your health '' . 
  `` b\u016bk '' , it means `` be '' , as in `` be healthy '' but it 's shortened a bit . 
  often even that '' \u012e '' from the first option is enough . 
  it 's pronounced as `` ee '' . 
  we like to drink quickly and efficiently without unnecessary technicalities before each shot . 
  there are professional actors doing medieval battle stuff at at all interesting castles . 
  also , castles are more like museums , often with entrance fees and all that . 
  you ca n't just walk into a museum with a sword and then do stupid shit there . 
  well , there was the grand duchy of lithuania a few hundred years ago . 
  it 's not an issue anymore . 
  now we just hope that certain no-one wo n't take any of our current territories . 
  gypsies are a big issue that refuses to be solved . 
  luckily , they 're all mostly live in one small village next to vilnius . 
  they 're all either making or distributing hard drugs , they refuse to take jobs because drugs are way more profitable , they refuse to let their kids go to schools because pickpocketing is a lot more useful skill than math , and they scream discrimination when electrical power is cut because they refuse to pay the bills . 
  as for immigrants , we got some refugees from the middle east and africa . 
  a few got some jobs , a few more ran away to uk or sweden as soon as they got enough money for a ticket . 
  we got more refugees/immigrants from ukraine , they 're nice people and they work hard . 
  most are anti-putin/pro-europe , so we kind of get along . 
  there are only a few , and they all seem to be working in kebab shops . 
  kebabs are good . 
  me neither . 
  our current government is very keen on increasing prices of everything , banning alcohol , etc. 
  so we 'll be coming for groceries to you . 
  somehow lithuanian beer or mineral water is cheaper in poland than it is in lithuania . 
  normally once or twice per year . 
  i went to mine a few weeks ago for the first time in five years . 
  got a dental cleaning with an ultrasonic scaler and there also was one tiny cavity . 
  yup , it 's still just like that . 
  norway/uk/germany is so nice , everything 's amazing , life 's good , wages are great , crime is low , retirement is comfortable ... wait , they let faggots get married and even adopt kids ? 
  nooo , this is the end of the world as we know it , geyrope , etc. 
  yes , same as blackberries and blueberries . 
  however , they 're very expensive . 
  coworker 's parents have a small farm where they grow blackberries . 
  a kilogram from them costs about the same as 200g from supermarket . 
  georgians are really nice , but that 's not really europe so i 'll go with italy and spain . 
  mostly spain . 
  there 's an old saying/insult left over from the soviet union days , \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0438\u0437 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c ( chelovek iz moskovskoe oblast ) , person from moscow region . 
  chmo for short . 
  it 's someone who 's very arrogant , expects everything to be handed to them and expects to be treated as royalty . 
  back in those days there was a shortage of pretty much everything . 
  when something new was produced , the capital city ( moscow ) was the first to receive it and people in that city were the first ones to buy . 
  this included everything from cars to bread . 
  leftovers were sent off to other areas , if there were any leftovers . 
  i lived in rental houses while studying in the uk , some of them had locks on bedroom doors . 
  never seen a lock in normal family houses anywhere in europe . 
   absentee ownership soo , rent ?
