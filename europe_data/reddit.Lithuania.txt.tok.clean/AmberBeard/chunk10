  now quote your nonpoint again and ignore every question i ask you because you have nothing of value to say . 
  if russian helicopters violate foreign sovereign airspace and the radars do not register violations and there is only eye witness testimony , do they make a sound ? 
  are you studying philosophy and making extra scratch by being a kremlinbot ? 
  you do n't seem to grasp the difference between official radar confirmation and eye witness testimony . 
  do i need to repeat myself again or should i just write it down in russian for you ? 
  also at first you 're saying that a guy in a forest probably saw a helicopter . 
  then when i say that it was n't just a guy but a group of border patrol officials and they saw not one but 3 helicopters then you try to spin it in some weird `` those helicopters that at first i said were not helicopters ( or even did not exist ) have not violated any air space '' . 
  you know what ? 
  i will say it again because you 're that stupid , stupid . 
  i 'll try to spell it out so maybe this time you will get it . 
  the ** radar ** did not register a violation but there are witness reports by official border patrol professionals and armed forces officials that arrived at the scene . 
  the only reason anyone is playing semantic games with you is because the ** radar ** did not register the violation that ** happened ** . 
  got it now ? 
  so wait you 're trying to discredit what i 'm saying with quoting the source of the same thing i 'm saying ? 
  what are you exactly denying ? 
  that those three helicopters that were far away were not helicopters ? 
  because i already said that there was no clear id and that a violation was not registered . 
  you have n't denied a single thing i said just basically parroted what i already said just in different words . 
  now if you want to speak facts then we can do that . 
  lithuania does not have those types of helicopters much less 3 of them that you so eagerly want to attribute for the polish side in the op article . 
  now using the method of elimination . 
  whose country 's helicopters could have come from the russian exclave ? 
  gee let 's think . 
  i think that the country with the name russia seems to fit the name of ** russia ** n exclave the best out of all the country names in the world . 
  maybe that 's it ? 
  and before you reach your final form of retardation let me repeat myself that there was no violation registered by the radars . 
  we have official witness reports by professionals not some random yokels out in the forest looking for mushrooms ( an image that you are trying to conjure up ) . 
  knowing russia 's track record in the region it is more than safe to say that yes those were without a doubt , obviously and most definitely russian helicopters and it 's painfully clear that they violated lithuanian air space and just hovered in lithuanian sovereign territory to see lithuania 's response time . 
  there 's no probably involved . 
  border patrol saw three helicopters just hovering in lithuanian territory for up to 3 minutes and informed the armed forces . 
  it 's only `` alleged '' because radars did not pick it up to register a violation because the helicopters were flying low and a clear id was not established in that short time frame . 
  gee , i wonder whose helicopters could have come from the russian exclave ? 
  must 've been any country ** except ** russia , right ? 
  how about let 's not pretend to be stupid for a moment ? 
  exact same thing happened in lithuania last tuesday . 
  only it was border patrol that witnessed it in our case . 
  op article does n't go into it but in our local news it was all on the alleged side because the radars did n't pick it up due to the helicopters flying low . 
  same thing was reported in lithuania last tuesday . 
  edit : it was reported on thursday but it happened on tuesday . 
  you just keep digging your own hole deeper and deeper do n't you ? 
  samogitian is a dialect :d just goes to show how little you understand what you 're trying to push . 
  hey it 's not my fault that you 're ill informed buddy . 
  well if you say you 're polish i will believe you . 
  he said he was lithuanian . 
  do you think he was lying ? 
  i really like how you history revisionists while furthering your own agendas discredit even the person you 're talking about . 
  the man ** himself ** said he was lithuanian . 
  but i guess he was brainwashed too ? 
   brainwashed people . 
  i 'd only want t remind you that you wo n't change history . 
  no matter what you want or wish . 
  oh , the irony . 
   if just historical facts does n't apply to you and you react by laugh ( because that 's the only response when you have nothing to say , because you have no argument to oppose ) you 'd like to think that would n't you ? 
  people laugh because pseudoscience and history revisionism should me ridiculed . 
  it 's just astonishing how you can not comprehend how ill informed you are with the internet at your finger tips . 
  then again , you must frequent some flat earth forums as well ... 
  wait , really ? 
  that 's so weird . 
  what 's the point of copyrighting `` grand dutchy '' ? 
  i do n't use drugs so i do n't share your experiences . 
  yup . 
  is the polish w = u ? 
  he probably learnt it more than 30 years ago . 
  you two geezers should probably stop parroting soviet era propaganda horseshit in public if you want your opinions to be taken seriously in the future . 
  sounds closer to how we say it . 
  hey now !, 
  we were a * grand * dutchy . 
  lol , k. 
  that very well may be the case . 
  pretty sure russia by any name was doing the whole satellite and sphere of influence bullshit since forever and while the world more or less moved on , russia never grew out of this medieval mentality . 
  i 'm signing this document as well . 
   now we know  that means what ever russia says it 's probably a lie . 
  no offense but this made me sincerely laugh . 
  in a `` no shit , sherlock '' kind of way . 
  hopefully , more people will come to the same conclusion as you in western europe and the us . 
  would be about freakin time , 
  i still do n't get how your mom knows that those people mostly eat zeppelins if she just tells them to change their diets without asking what their diets are ( she probably does ask but you said that the conversation is pretty one sided mostly coming from your mom ) . 
  you did say many . 
  saying that there are a lot of people in lithuania who eat zeppelins 3 times per day just raises questions for me . 
  there 's no way there are a lot of such individuals . 
  not that that any of this matters but your gross overgeneralization just rubbed me the wrong way . 
  fair enough . 
  and they specifically say that their diet consists mainly of zeppelins or how does that conversation go ? 
  i would still guess that people who eat zeppelins a lot are a minority in lithuania . 
  from my experience most people eat them one or two times per year at best . 
  wow , i get exaggeration but that 's just stupid what you said . 
  who the hell eats zeppelins 3 times per day ? 
  boy , can this guy write an endorsement !, 
  commonwealthophobia !, 
  they are so natophobic . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  haha , the first thing i thought after reading the title is : `` he 's in deep shit now '' . 
  projecting 101 . 
  that 's the russian foreign policy motto . 
  bisons have already been reintroduced in poland , lithuania , belarus , ukraine , romania , russia , slovakia , latvia , germany , moldova , spain , denmark , bulgaria and czech republic . 
  this is hardly a return to europe . 
  edit : oh , and it seems the netherlands already had a herd of 24 in 2013 . 
  i wan na say donatas banionis because solaris is so well known and maybe ingeborga dapk\u016bnait\u0117 because she seems to star in a lot of international movies . 
  but that 's hardly up to date and i do n't really follow that kind of thing . 
  from what i 've heard our theatre is well respected internationally so there 's probably some great actors in there as well .
