  '' may you get a cramp while shitting !!! '', 
  that 's the first one that came to my mind . 
  not really wtf though is it ? 
  just colourful language :d, 
  add the croatian president in the mix and world peace is imminent . 
  does laura codru\u0163a k\u00f6vesi count as a politician ? 
  you had that one saved up for a while did n't you ? 
  not that it 's a common or very widespread stereotype but i like it when people think that we 're goat sacrificing , dark magic using , devil worshippers and all around pagans . 
   cons :     weather . 
  it 's the worst con for me , i would be 10 times happier if we did not have this shitty weather i like the weather :| i 'd go crazy in a country that has 1 season throughout the whole year . 
  take your pick : * i have no motivation . 
  * i am lazy . 
  * i just do n't care . 
  * i have no interest in it . 
  it 's mostly all of the above . 
  the bigger ferries were launched not to accommodate the russian trucks specifically but to keep the traffic jam moving which has accumulated a few days if not a week later after poland issued the ban . 
  we have our own trucks that need to go to places as well you know . 
   if your country wants more sanctions against russia it can lead by example . 
  again , what do you expect ? 
  this poland and russian truck thing is between those two countries . 
  lithuania ** is ** leading by example along with poland on advocating to not revoke the sanctions that are currently in place . 
  okay ... first of all it was n't * my * call and i do n't speak for all lithuanians . 
  second of all i 'm pretty sure lithuania 's one of the countries that has been hit the most by the sanctions on russia yet has stayed consistent on not revoking and prolonging them . 
  thirdly , and i may be mistaken here , but this particular truck traffic ban on russian trucks in poland is completely unrelated and concerns only those two countries . 
  do you expect lithuania to cut all diplomatic ties with russia as well ? 
  fair enough . 
  i do n't buy the negligence angle . 
  if anything it 's gross negligence . 
  but i 'm not an expert on legal jargon so whatever . 
  also even if it is just negligence , as you say , that still does n't mean that we should go by the path of least resistance . 
  i think this is where we will not find common ground on this . 
  you do n't see a problem of having a country that makes it a point of interjecting it 's own opinions on nearly every issue in the region , yet when it 's time to take responsibility it turns into an equivalent of a child taking the ball and going home after it starts losing at the game that everyone was playing ? 
  that 's a very defeatist attitude you have . 
  i also do n't know what could be done , but surely the people who are responsible for imposing sanctions and whatnot do have other ideas on how to approach this issue . 
  something ** should ** be done to hold russia accountable imo . 
  so wait ... you 're saying that because it 's not likely to happen again , we should forget about it ? 
  russia just needs to say `` we dindo nuffin but if we did then we would definitely not shoot at civilian airliners '' and that 's it ? 
  what happened with being responsible for your actions ? 
   though it was emitted earlier this month , the belch continues to resonate . 
  cheeky guardian . 
  well i 'm an idiot . 
  when i searched for bellingcat i got a link to their report but it was in russian :| did n't bother to see if there 's an english option . 
  i read or heard somewhere that it 's actually not good news . 
  apparently , the trees that were replanted ( or let to regrow ) are a darker shade of green than the trees which were growing per-industrialisation . 
  so because europe has become a lot more forested , the trees now attract a lot more sunlight as well due to their darker shade . 
  thanks !, 
   afterall we were the world 's first ( and only to this date i believe ) atheist state that 's interesting . 
  could you provide more info on that ? 
  read this on a lithuanian news site and found only this link for an english translation . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.scribd.com/doc/300152151/belling-cat ) is the link to the actual report by bellingcat for those interested . 
  [ wonder no more !,

  haha , brilliant . 
  you 're just worse at it . 
   ruthenia and russia are latinized versions of `` rus '' , while rossia is a greek version . 
  i thought ruthenia is latin for rus ' and russia is latin for the greek version rossia ( or was is rhossia ? ), 
  that got popular at some point . 
  presumably rossia is greek for rus ' as well . 
  i have heard the one with the ordering tea from the house plant !, 
  or some variation of it anyway . 
  now apologize for the northern crusades . 
  what does n't upset russia at this point ? 
  i see you 're in the school of dave chapelle of cumming right on time . 
  there 's also a matter of vocabulary . 
  for example i can read german and i could watch the news in german or watch a german movie and i would understand most of what is said because of the added context , however , i could not retell in german what i heard because i just can not conjure up the more complex words that i want to express even though i might understand them if i heard them . 
  it 's mostly because of lack of use . 
  so i disagree that if you can read in some language that it automatically translates into being able to speak in that language . 
  it 's baffling to me how you think that i 'm being very emotional because i have no emotional stake in this . 
  i 'm quoting sentences not words and i like how you do n't even acknowledge my commentary about how a large portion of your points are baseless and the fact that i am mostly repeating the same goddamn point throughout this whole thread yet you keep moving the goal post . 
  i 'm not trying to win anything here and the further we talk the more i think that you think that i am trying to claim something which i am completely not doing . 
  i would like to know where you see nationalistic banter because that is exactly what i am denouncing in this particular topic . 
  nationalism was n't even a thing so for poland to claim that ko\u015bciuszko was polish in itself is a redundant claim without the lack of context and nuance of a shared and common history . 
  same goes for claiming he was lithuanian or belorussian btw . 
  so please if you are going to accuse me of nationalistic banter and being engaged in dishonest ways of debating then you could at least give me the courtesy of not twisting my words . 
   `` you seem to put the horse before the cart - eu is the political identity of the place we all live in , `` german , french , czech '' is the identity we have based on the mother tongues we speak at home and cultures we carry . 
  `` litvin '' and `` litvak '' were the political identities of the people ( slavic or jewish ) who lived in the grand duchy , whilst rhuthenian , polish , russian were the ethnic identities based on culture and language . '', 
  again as i stated before . 
  speaking the same language does not automatically mean that the cultural background is identical of the two speakers . 
  and again if ko\u015bciuszko considered himself to be polish ( which he did n't because no nationalism ) why did he feel the need to identify himself as litvin ? 
  you say that litvin were the political identities of slavic people but then say that ruthenian = litvins were ethnic identities based on culture and language . 
  you 're contradicting yourself . 
   `` if you spoke rhuthenian at home and adhered to the culture you were rhuthenian , if you did polish you were a pole , but both of you were also litvin 's because you did that as slavs inside the grand dutchy . '', 
  if you spoke whatever language but lived in an area where the majority of the population were ruthenian and your roots were ruthenian you would adhere to the culture of ruthenia whatever that was . 
  if you spoke polish and held the crown in high regard but called yourself a litvin it is intellectually dishonest for anyone to then claim that that person was clearly polish which again as a concept did not exist at the time . 
   `` there is the overreaching political identity of the people living inside the duchy , and then the smaller , ethnic-based identity of each of them based on the culture and language they had . '', 
  you put far too much emphasis on language for this time period and this particular country . 
  ** again ** ethnic-based identities as a concept did not exist it was still largely territorial and tribal in nature and the territory that ko\u015bciuszko identified with was the grand duchy . 
  however , this does not mean that he was not a citizen of the commonwealth as a whole which for some reason you keep to think i am claiming . 
   `` since the duchy no longer exists the `` litvin '' part is just historical now , no one identifies with the the way he did . 
  but since polish language and culture still exist , there are those who can claim ko\u015bciuszko based on that , and that is the poles . 
  modern lithuanians and belarusians have nothing to claim ko\u015bciuszko by - they do n't speak the language he did , nor identify with the state he did as `` litvins '' . '', 
  that 's an absurd notion that if a country does not exist anymore that anyone with a vague geographical connection can then claim some sort of historical ownership . 
  please look into [ sarmatism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarmatism ) . 
  sarmatians did no exist anymore so the nobility of the commonwealth adopted it as their own . 
  sarmatians did n't come out of the same language branch . 
  and as i said in my previous post . 
  old prusians do n't exist anymore . 
  according to this statement i am quoting you claim that herkus monte was a russian because the area where the prussian uprisings happened are not inhabited by a majority of russian speakers . 
   `` so what 's the connection ? 
  what does a lithuanian from somewhere in kaunas have in common with him ?
