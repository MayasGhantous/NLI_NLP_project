  not the political identity as litvin , not the language , not the culture ... meanwhil , a polish person from anywhere in the world has a lot in common with him - the basics actually , language and culture . 
  so it just seems logical the poles should claim him today . '', 
  the connection is common and shared history . 
  a lithuanian from kaunas has the same in common with ko\u015bciuszko as a pole or a belarussian . 
  because we were all a part of the commonwealth . 
  and guess what - a random polish person from krakow right now ** does not ** speak the same polish as ko\u015bciuszko did . 
  again you mention culture but you keep assuming that language = culture . 
  you do n't need to look any further than modern poland and look at some maps that get posted here . 
  west of poland and east of poland have vast cultural differences and that 's in the age of the internet . 
  can you imagine how the cultural differences were far more expressed back then ? 
  `` so it just seems logical the poles should claim him today '' . 
  that 's an asinine statement as a whole . 
  the man himself did not identify as polish because nationalism did n't exist as a concept but you 're saying that poland should ascribe their own nationalism on him anyway and disregard any kind of context to the time period , the cultural climate , the man 's own words ? 
  tl ; dr ko\u015bciuszko was a citizen of the commonwealth . 
  he was not polish , he was not ruthenian , he was not lithuanian . 
  nationalism was n't a thing . 
  common history . 
   if you did polish you were a pole that 's an absurd notion . 
  there were plenty of people that spoke polish but were orthodox and not catholic . 
   since the dutchy no longer exists the `` litvin '' part is just historical now there are a lot of countries and peoples that do n't exist anymore . 
  are you implying that old prussians were russians and not different prussian tribes because k\u00f6ningsberg is populated largely by russians now ? 
  keep in mind that that region was also mostly german speakers before ww2 . 
   modern lithuanians and belarusians have nothing to claim kosciosko of course neither country can claim complete ownership but they ** all ** can and do consider him a national hero . 
  and frankly if you 're going to use modern notions of nationality then he was clearly mostly ruthenian and you should be saying that he was clearly belorussian . 
   but since polish language and culture still exist lithuanian and belorussian cultures also still exist . 
  your point is meaningless . 
   what does a lithuanian from somewhere in kaunas have in common with him ? 
  why is this relevant ? 
   so it just seems logical the poles should claim him today . 
  i guess the concept of ** common ** history is beyond your cognitive capabilities . 
  i 'm done repeating myself ad nauseam . 
   no i mean why not just polish because it 's intellectually dishonest lacking in any context . 
   he never identified with their culture , hence he 's not part of their ethnicities or culture yes , he did . 
  he identified as a litvin . 
  are you saying that he was lying ? 
   kosciosko was just polish no he was n't . 
  remember that nationalism was n't even a thing back then . 
  it was loyalty to the crown and the crown was polish . 
  if suddenly the crown went to ruthenia or lithuania he would then identify himself with that culture if it had any kind of influence . 
   `` litvin '' , but this is n't an ethnic term yes , it is . 
  it 's what ruthenian citizens of the grand duchy of lithuania called themselves . 
  do n't confuse the commonwealth to other countries that were much more homogeneous . 
  it 's not really comparable . 
  at least i ca n't think of a good comparison . 
  i mean even take the uk . 
  people there clearly identify as scottish , welsh , north irish or english and to my knowledge always did . 
  the commonwealth was a lot more fluid in that respect and since a certain point in history calling people just polish or just lithuanian or just ruthenian is just plain inaccurate unless there is historical evidence of them claiming what they considered themselves to be . 
  ko\u015bciuszko identified as a litvin but because he did not speak a word of ruthenian it 's hard to claim that he was just ruthenian . 
  also because he was highly patriotic to the commonwealth as a whole adds to it as well . 
  slavic people called themselves litvin which meant a citizen of the grand duchy of lithuania . 
  jews in the duchy called themselves litvak . 
  litvak and litvin are translations of lietuvis . 
  no dna is needed because we know his ancestry is mostly ruthenian . 
  the whole commonwealth identified with polish culture because it had the biggest influence and of course he identified with the polish culture because that was largely the culture of the whole commonwealth but again he did n't call himself polish . 
  why ? 
  because he identified himself as a litvin ( aka ruthenian ) even though he did not speak a word of it . 
  that is pretty telling that he was qualifying cultures in some way or at least his own ancestry . 
  people in the eu identify with european values but only the minority would call themselves europeans before german , french , czech etc. 
  the commonwealth was a multi-ethnic population and the commonwealth 's culture included influences from them all . 
  just because polish culture had the biggest influence does n't give an excuse for polish ultra nationalists to claim that the commonwealth and everything about it was exclusively polish . 
  it 's intellectually dishonest and completely lacking any nuance or context . 
  because polish-lithuanian-ruthenian is a mouth full . 
  that is correct but not the full context . 
  his paternal side was lithuanian-ruthenian and the maternal side was ruthenian . 
  he himself identified as a litvin even though he did not speak belarusian . 
  surely , no one can argue with what he himself identified as . 
  he was a citizen of the commonwealth and saying that he was just polish is intellectually dishonest . 
  that 's all i 'm saying . 
  people blew this way out of proportion as if i were denying that he was polonized or something . 
  well point taken then i suppose :d, 
  what 's so hard to understand about `` he spoke polish '' ? 
  actually , ruthenia is latin for rus ' which is not equal to russia as far as i remember . 
  i meant weird as in there 's no clear cut answer for his ethnicity not that i find the concept weird  you 're preaching to the choir here . 
  absolutely . 
  that 's why i said that i would n't call him straight up polish or that he was n't lithuanian . 
  i 'll repeat myself here . 
  if anything , by modern terms he was ruthenian because his maternal side was ruthenian and his paternal side was lithuanian-ruthenian but most importantly he self-identified as a litvin even though he spoke polish and did not speak a word of ruthenian . 
  litvin was the term that ruthenians used to call themselves citizens of the grand duchy of lithuania . 
  it did not literally mean lithuanian . 
  i completely agree . 
  that 's the reason why i said that i would not call tadeusz ko\u015bciuszko straight up polish or that he was n't lithuanian . 
  if anything , by modern terms , he was ruthenian or i guess belorussian . 
  but even then , like you said , most people considered themselves to be citizens of the commonwealth first . 
   pi\u0142sudski he was a polonized lithuanian who considered himself to be a descendant of the culture and traditions of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
   mickiewicz polonized belarussian or lithuanian or just polish . 
  considered to be a national poet by lithuania , poland and belarus alike . 
  most probably considered himself to be a descendant of the culture and traditions of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth like pilsudski . 
  i do n't see your point honestly . 
  haha , i love how it 's full of half-truths and devoid of sources . 
  allow me to expand . 
  lithuania as a term was created by the highland tribes of lithuania : nal\u0161\u0117nai and their land called nal\u0161ia , deltuviai and their land called deltuva , land called neris , old lithuanians and their land called lietuva ( most likely lei\u010diai who joined up with neighbouring tribes ) and the land of deremela . 
  then surrounding non highland tribes joined up later . 
  like a part of yotvingians etc. 
  lithuania means union . 
  how some people joke around that americans should call themselves united statians that 's what lithuanians call themselves , however , the meaning is not literal . 
  literally `` lietuva '' means either a mold or a product of something being poured in a mold as in smith crafting term . 
  later when the grand duchy of ** union ** expanded to ruthenian lands , slavic citizens of the grand duchy started calling themselves litvin which i 'm sure you know literally means lithuanian ( as in joined the union ) . 
  the jews of the grand duchy called themselves litvaks . 
  from the top of my head i would say it 's similar how hawaiians can refer to themselves as americans because they are part of the usa . 
  when you say that modern lithuanians think of themselves not in the same way as tadeusz ko\u015bciuszko did , you are correct because no one thinks they are citizens of the grand duchy of lithuania anymore and even at that time only slavic people used that term for themselves .
