  not really confirmed to be non-fictional ( for lack of a better word ) . 
  it ** is ** called the double u. 
  in armenia . 
  makes you wonder how the polish-lithuanian commonwealth could have happened with this setup . 
  :d edit : separated from braliukas :'(, 
  it 's very subtle and i ca n't really put my finger on it but there have been times when i thought `` hmm ... he 's talking weird '' and then it turns out he 's from kaunas and it all makes sense . 
  i still have no idea what it is though . 
  troll reference i assume . 
  edit : ok , for the moron that downvoted me . 
  troll - as in the mythical creature from norse mythology . 
  the creature that kidnaps and eats children ffs . 
  united in basketball . 
  well then most answers should be hitler , stalin , genghis khan etc. 
  immortality is yet to be discovered , unfortunately . 
  thanks !, 
  but i [ stole ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38nbs1/the_rise_of_lithuania_as_a_force_in_it_why_google/crwp5ud ) it :p, 
  oh , right . 
  my bad . 
   erdapfel that 's earth apples . 
  poland and lithuania can into nordic ? 
  should n't bosni\u00eb and herzegovina be half green half other ? 
  thank you , georgia . 
  it 's appreciated , 
  wow , have n't heard this joke in years . 
  though in the version i remember the hero of the story literally drove ( on ? ), 
  a sea of shit like jesus walking on water . 
  so does that make it a successor of hre and thus the roman empire ? 
  liechtenstein the third rome ? 
  is n't it liechtenstein though ? 
  seems to me that you should be asking the canadian this question . 
  haha , this one made me chuckle . 
  yes , that 's true as well . 
  people have rationalized worse things in history . 
  and how many times have you read how cia are responsible for this and that and how europe is a puppet of usa ? 
  as far as russia 's narrative is concerned nato = usa . 
  also , i never said he was dumb . 
  i 'm saying that he thinks that he is smarter than he really is and that people do n't see what he 's doing . 
  just because the pandering gets eaten up domestically does n't mean that the obvious bullshit is n't obvious internationally and especially in the former soviet countries . 
  just look at how often poland calls on russia 's shit or how russian foreign minister got laughed at when giving a speech with the usual bs bulletpoints at some international event . 
  personal anecdote : i had a clone of putin as a class mate . 
  highly intelligent person but a social sociopath and when putin goes off script you can see his `` i 'm better than everyone on earth '' attitude shine through . 
  i bet you know these types of people as well . 
  oh , i see how you could have understood it that way . 
  no , i was definitely not saying that . 
   i was mainly saying that when someone has certain ideas or `` plots '' they start thinking that everyone is thinking the same things that they are . 
  like all the unfounded accusations from russia on other countries . 
  i agree with most of your points . 
  actually , all of them . 
  just some opinion based stuff i would like to add : 1 ) spot on and this is the crowd that just eats up whataboutisms from russia especially since ww2 gets brought up all the time for no reason at all to remind everyone that `` russia saved the world ! '' . 
  it adds to the whole russia is obviously great but the west is bullying us by not acknowledging us . 
  if not for the aggressive nato oppressing everyone then they would totally openly love us . 
  cry-bullying at its finest and this sentiment has been expressed by even our regular russian redditors . 
  there was some thread about what people were surprised to find out other countries thought about their country and most russians i saw said a variation of `` that everyone hates us '' or `` that everyone does n't love us '' . 
  or at least that was the most voted up one by a russian redditor iirc . 
  2 ) i would say that most western europeans are so baffled by the statements made by russia that a lot of them start thinking that `` something that crazy just has to be true because no respectable head of state would make it up '' . 
  i got the impression that western european countries are completely not used to horribly blatant and offensive statements and that 's why it works . 
   it does n't make sense if you look at it from the point of view that he actually believes what he 's saying . 
  i think that he 's fully aware of the bullshit he 's pushing but that does n't mean that he does n't project nor that he does n't somehow rationalize that bullshit in his head . 
  take that interview that a lot of people were posting where putin is talking about how russia has no plans to annex crimea or somehow jeopardize the sovereign integrity of ukraine ( or any other country i think but i 'm not sure about the latter part ) . 
  as far as i remember the question was a complete soft ball and it was putin that went out of his way to push the issue that `` noooo russia would never do something like thaaat * wink wink * '' . 
  that 's why i say he 's projecting and that 's why i think he thinks that he 's smarter than he is . 
  it 's because of his arrogance that he always includes these little jabs in most of his interviews followed by that shit eating smirk of his . 
  he 's taunting the west with `` i 'm better than you-uuu na na na na-a ~ '' . 
  works great on the domestic audience . 
  he just ** needs ** to get one over the west . 
  how many years has it been for him to have this superstar manly-man status in russia ? 
  that obviously went to his head . 
  he 's not censoring himself enough because he still thinks that russia is a superpower and can get away with lies of imperialistic levels and you know how threads about russia 's superpower status go around here . 
  that and him being surrounded by yes men probably adds to his delusions . 
  compare even the jokes he makes with the jokes obama reads that writers have written for him . 
  obama 's jokes are safe , kinda obvious , goofy and non threatening - basically dad jokes . 
  putin 's jokes are equivalents of yo mamma 's jokes . 
  it 's all about degrading something to appear better in comparison with putin . 
  i think it 's pretty obvious that putin likes to go off script fairly often . 
  the whole funneling funds things is exactly what the russian empire did to undermine the polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  everything russia is doing is either projecting or has been done by the soviets or the czars . 
  putin is n't stupid enough to believe his own bullshit outright but his mentality is that what he 's doing is n't outdated thinking and i would say that he rationalizes a great deal of his own nonsense . 
  to sum it up , i would say that all what you have said and projecting due to high levels of narcissism are not mutually exclusive . 
  russia 's intelligence agencies and putin 's personal advisers know what they 're doing but when putin goes off script is when he shows his true colours imo . 
  you do n't have to be stupid to project and while i would n't call him an idiot as well , i would say that he definitely is n't as smart as he thinks he is ( judging from his snarky and arrogant behaviour from various interviews ) or as smart as some people try to make him out to be . 
  if not blatant projection what should it be called though ? 
  other than hypocrisy that is . 
  russia 's foreign policy is everything that russia keeps accusing others of doing . 
  even before they do it sometimes . 
  they accuse a country of * trying * to do something to undermine russia and then the following month you hear of russia doing the same thing they were crying about before . 
  does n't have to be usa or even a nato member . 
  if that 's not projecting then i do n't know what is . 
  unless it 's some kind of preemptive action to have an excuse later because `` they did it too '' . 
  because everyone knows that whataboutisms are totally legit arguements that should be taken seriously , right ? 
  which still is projecting imo . 
  that 's putin projecting . 
  since that is how russia handles things he thinks that that 's how america and thus nato ( because it 's the same thing right ? ), 
  does it as well . 
  not the cheeeese !, 
  anything but the cheese !, 
  it 's the only town in lithuania that still practices a certain part of ( the day before ) ash wednesday celebration aka u\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s ( the time before lent ) . 
  it 's a guy in a costume . 
  `` the celebration corresponds to roman catholic holiday traditions in other parts of the world , such as mardi gras , shrove tuesday , and carnaval . '', 
  - wiki . 
  he gave shaq a run for his money though while having all sorts of issues from his injuries * and * being 8 years older .
