   gentleman off the court boy can he be a sarcastic grouch though . 
  there 's a very famous clip of a goofy reporter asking him stupid questions and sabonis just tears into him . 
  sabonis has no tolerance for stupid questions , that 's when all the gentlemen stuff goes out the window . 
  everyone used to clap in my school 's cafeteria when something would shatter . 
  i still do that from time to time and end up being the single asshole in the room clapping at someones misfortune . 
  i would feel right at home in the uk . 
  then we are in agreement . 
  as far as this particular video goes - it 's garbage . 
  no doubt that a lot of lithuanians do n't even consider any of the ruthenias ( black rus for instance being ethnically baltic before being slavicized ) or samogitia when talking about the grand duchy and later when talking about the commonwealth ( but for a different reason ) . 
  and they are wrong for doing that but at least there are no blatant propaganda videos stating that afaik . 
  it 's just mostly colloquial . 
  part of it is that the focus is on lithuania during history classes and there 's just not enough time to go into detail of it all , especially for teenage attention spans , then of course is the whole national pride thing when `` common history '' does n't sound as good as `` we defeated the teutonic order '' . 
  however , that being the case does n't give a pass for videos such as this one to just go completely off the rails and to spout mythology as if it were fact . 
  that said , to my knowledge , there is n't really a good comparison in history for most things be it yugoslavia , the british empire or the grand duchy of lithuania . 
  thing is the british empire is called british for a reason and the same thing can be said for all the other empires that the majority of population were not of the ruling class . 
  as it were with lithuanians marrying into polish nobility and polonizing so were the ruthenian nobility marrying into lithuanian nobility after mindaugas ( but they were not lithuanizing because there was no lithuanian orthography at the time ) . 
  the expansion was from lithuania 's side and the ruling nobility were `` lithuanians '' ( again nationalism was n't a thing even though lithuania as an entity existed ) until the union with poland when the ruling class shifted to polish nobility . 
  nevertheless , that does n't mean that the non-ruling class did n't have powerful houses/families . 
  it 's a mess to get through and way easier to say `` we share common history '' rather than adding footnotes to every sentence :d, 
   the british empire comparisson was very far fetched - the slavs of the grand dutchy were n't a colonial population , ruled directly and with zero chance of breaking free . 
  they had a large percentage of the nobility ( unlike any african lords in the upper chamber of the empire ) , as well as from what i understand were the majority of the armed forces , since those came in feudal fashion from the entire dutchy . 
  ( again unlike britain , where colonial troops were just auxiliary ) it 's pretty hard to find ideal comparisons for any given historical situation since pretty much every situation is unique . 
  like i said that was just a little side comment . 
  again , populations did n't matter . 
  it was loyalty to the crown and territorialism . 
  the majority of the population were loyal to the lithuanian grand dukes . 
   so if the slavs wanted to break the dutchy they easily could 've done it against the small baltic component of lithuanians . 
  they did n't , because it became simply their state as much of the lithuanians - with their nobles , their army formations , their mayors of towns etc. 
  assumptions . 
  and there 's a lot more nuance to it . 
  if it were all up to numbers then the battle of kircholm would have been a loss to the commonwealth . 
   what was a lithuanian-baltic land conquered in the middle ages gradually became a co-lithuanian/co-ruthenian state within the commonwealth . 
  thus they have zero claim on the medieval dutchy - built and ruled by the baltic lithuanians , but equal claim on the commonwealth dutchy of lithuania . 
  i would n't say equal per se and it was n't exactly `` co '' just because ruthenia was n't exactly a single entity but you 're repeating my point that we share common history . 
  let me repeat myself what the problem with the video is . 
  the video claims that everything mentioned in the video belongs ( for a lack of a better word ) solely to belarus . 
  they can build statues to lithuanian grand dukes all they want because those individuals were our common rulers but once they start saying that those dukes were belarusians and that lithuanians are false lithuanians is when it turns to propaganda . 
  let me put it this way . 
  the video is saying that the number pi is equal to exactly 3 ignoring what comes after . 
  is that somewhat correct when you round it up ? 
  sure . 
  is there more to it ? 
  absolutely . 
  the video is dishonest with it 's statements thus it is utter and complete horseshit . 
  that is wayyyyy down the line and the population point is quite redundant pre-nationalism . 
  i 'm pretty sure at the height of the british empire the english population was n't the majority of it so should the british empire be adopted by some african countries as their ancestors ? 
  i mean surely the druids who built the stonehenge were black right ? 
  but that 's besides the point . 
  they start talking about mindaugas the one and only king of lithuania as if he was slavic which is not true . 
  all the dukes mentioned ( except the polotsk ones ) spoke lithuanian if they ruled over `` belarusians '' ( which was n't even a thing back then ) who may have been the majority of the population at a later stage of the duchy that does n't make the duchy belarusian . 
  the complete name of the grand dutchy of lithuania before the union with poland was `` the grand dutchy of lithuania , samogitia , ruthenia and others '' . 
  ruthenia being white rus , black rus and red rus . 
  belarus as an entity did n't even exist . 
  so it 's a bit complicated . 
  now that being said that does n't mean that they do n't share a great amount of history with lithuanians , polish , ukrainians . 
  for example all the battles mentioned had huge amounts of what one could call belarusians maybe except the battle of kircholm i 'm not entirely sure on that one . 
  the problem is when bullshit like that video claim that all aspects of shared , common and sometimes even exclusive to other nations history concerns belarus only belarus and nothing but belarus . 
  well , i mean the incorrect historical facts are pretty blatant so it should be pretty obvious ... 
  the part where they say that the grand duchy of ** lithuania ** was belarusian should have tipped you off for one . 
  the video starts off with neuri being ancestors of belarus is also sketchy . 
  they list most grand dukes of lithuania as being `` slavic '' . 
  they mention a revolutionary as being belarusian which is n't exactly honest . 
  he was indeed from a `` belarusian '' background but since nationalism was n't really a thing back then the dude was a citizen of the commonwealth , however , this part is the least offensive of the whole video . 
  the whole video is just riddled with bullshit and half-truths so do forgive me for being skeptical of your initial question , 
  do you really have to ask ? 
  apparently there will be solar eclipse in a few thousand years above some key islands that keep the day thing going . 
  so that 'll show em !, 
  i do n't have it yet though :(, 
  thanks for the offer but i have a friend living in the uk that comes back to lithuania a couple of times per year . 
  i 'll ask her for one , 
  * sigh *, 
  i want one :|, 
  ruthenia = / = russia and actually ruthenia is latin for rus ' which still is n't russia . 
  most european languages are referencing `` white rus ' '' aka ruthenia as in your latin example . 
  you should read [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_russia ) . 
  i can see a french comedy movie about this already . 
  according to what i 've read elsewhere there was also a troop patrolling the area with a bag from a shop in hand . 
  he did some christmas shopping while on duty . 
  i was wondering why this has n't popped up yet when i was browsing yesterday . 
  op delivered :d, 
  / r/russiadenies, 
  while usually most people say it sounds like russian , a german yesterday said that it sounds similar to finnish to him . 
  was expecting an outline of africa . 
  you know , dismissing what others have to say by labeling it as `` trolling '' will not lead to productive dialogues . 
  unless the trolling is blatant of course . 
  feel free to think that i am a troll and i will in turn think that you have tunnel vision regarding this topic . 
  so you admit that brazauskas did apologize but before you said that nothing was done . 
  so which is it ? 
  flip-flop away . 
   genocide museum is about genocide against lithuanians does jewish - ** lithuanians ** mean nothing for you or do you see jews as * the others * ? 
  i guess lithuanians should care more about the * jewish * tragedy and just ignore the deaths of non jewish-lithuanians ? 
  the punishments of those involved is a whole other story and if you think that there are no memorials to jews then you are sorely mistaken . 
  also i love it how yet again you gloss over every possible nuance with a simple `` bad things happened to jews thus ** everything ** should be done for them even when there are no capabilities '' without taking in the account that lithuania were occupied by the soviets so they first had to shake those assholes off then build a viable country foundation before they could possibly start focusing on anything else . 
  do you realize the corruption that was rampant at the time ? 
  but i guess all of that does n't matter . 
   also , do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i am not saying any of those things about other countries . 
  well , my friend then you have to start learning what words mean because that is exactly what you said . 
  oh , i 've read it unlike you who clearly did n't read what i wrote in my comments and i think you yourself have no idea what point you are trying to make with that article . 
  the situation in france and in lithuania were vastly different .
