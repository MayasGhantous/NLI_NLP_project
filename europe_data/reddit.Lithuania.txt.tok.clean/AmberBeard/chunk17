  `` lithuania '' itself came from latin i believe . 
  the root is liet the other versions come from the same root but have gone through changes . 
  i get it , but not being happy does not equate a civil war . 
  it might not look good on the world stage if uk left and it might set a precedent but i do n't see a huge shitstorm brewin in the scale of a war . 
  just my two cents . 
  that 's not really the same . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but i think it 's officially against the constitution for a state to leave the union without it being considered treason and treason automatically means war . 
  you almost got it . 
  it has the same root with `` to spill '' or `` to pour ( out ) '' - lieti . 
  only way rain has anything to do with this is that water floods and spills over ( u\u017elieja ) after rains . 
  to my knowledge this idea of `` lietuva kur lietus lyja '' was never a thing before the poem came out in like the 70s or something and rains in lithuania are not frequent enough to have any impact on how our language works or how we name things . 
  we have far more descriptive words for snow than rain . 
  it would make more sense if floods in spring time were the `` theory '' . 
  what seems to be the main hypothesis talks about a small hydronym that also has something to do with `` spillin over '' but the river is too small to have any significance . 
  the most logical hypothesis that no one seems to be talking about and even wikipedia does n't really mention outright is that the literal translation of lietuva is `` union '' . 
  from the same spilling as in `` i\u0161lieta '' . 
  you know like molding metal in forging and black-smithy or lithuania being the mold itself . 
  pouring pancake batter into the frying pan has more to do with the name than rain does . 
  what you can find in the lithuanian version of wikipedia is [ this ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/lietuviai_%28rytiniai_senlietuviai%29 ) . 
  we all know that lithuania is a tribal union of lithuanian highland tribes but it 's like we all magically forget about that because the popular saying rhymes a little even though not a lot of people know that it 's from a poem . 
  the tribes included are deltuvians , nalsen , neris river tribe ( s ) , deremela and old lithuanians ( most likely lei\u010diai which is the name that some latvians still use for us i think ) . 
  now if you really want to get into the name of lietuva , [ art\u016bras dubonis ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/lietuvos_istorija#pavadinimo_kilm.c4.97 ) suggests that lietuva came from the name of leitis aka old lithuanians . 
  now the meaning for leitis is up for debate but i do n't think it matters since by the time `` lietuva '' started popping up those older tribes were not around anymore . 
  it seems to me that the explanation that it means a strong bond and union aka a forged mold is the most reasonable . 
  ** all in all there is no consensus on the matter . 
  ** the biggest point i am trying to make here is look at all the various theories on the origin of the name in the second link . 
  not one of them mentions the most colloquially popular one that lietuva is the land of rain . 
  there 's no official consensus ( and i doubt anyone is really invested in reaching one in the historian circles ) but that does n't mean that 20th century poetry is suddenly scientifically accurate . 
  i voted for litua but i would prefer lietua or liettua . 
   ethnology do you mean etymology ? 
  well , i might have been too annoyed by this just because i was hungry earlier and raged a little . 
  if it 's just a thought experiment then whatever . 
  it 's a clunky name , i agree but having our name be litua or litva would only exacerbate the problem imo . 
  what sounds more similar to latvia ? 
  lithuania , litua , litva or litauen ? 
  to me lithuania seems to stand out the most as the least similar . 
  the reason more people know riga is because it 's the biggest baltic city and the name has always been riga to my knowledge while vilnius was not always known as `` vilnius '' also the declensions do n't help . 
  point is that the problem is that people are just stupid , ignorant , have no interest in geography or all of the above . 
  that 's the issue . 
  should austria change their name because there seem to be idiots out there who ca n't tell the difference between austria and australia ? 
  i would say no . 
  well it 's at\u0117nai in lithuanian . 
  a hard `` t '' . 
  just look at any generic german accent in movies . 
  all the `` th '' sounds turn to `` z '' . 
  some lithuanians are like that too , as well as some slavs i assume . 
  i know they are different sounds but to non english speakers it 's all a `` z '' sound . 
  i also love that the dude 's main grievance is that people seem to know estonia better than lithuania as if it 's because of the name . 
  sure , maybe the name does n't help but it 's all part of pr which admittedly estonia is relentless about . 
  just goes to show that he has no clue what he 's talking about . 
  same root . 
  only people that ca n't speak english in general complain about `` th '' . 
  honestly , what 's the point of changing the `` th '' sound in lithuania if the same people wo n't be able to even talk in english or use other common words like `` the '' or `` other '' etc. 
  check [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kartvelian_languages ) out . 
  no , it does n't . 
  i would vote for this option . 
  litua makes the most sense if we really wanted to simplify the name . 
  this proposal is idiotic . 
  since lithuanians ca n't pronounce `` th '' let 's make so that english speakers would n't be able to pronounce the german version - litauen herp derp . 
  or let 's `` simplify '' by removing one letter . 
  i get the feeling that z. mauricas himself ca n't pronounce the `` th '' sound and gets all embarrassed in meetings with foreigners so he decided that it would be a good idea to change the name officially . 
  edit : honestly , an economist should shut the fuck up about this stuff . 
  he could propose a change but his alternatives are stupid . 
  let some linguists and/or historians come up with alternatives if this is serious . 
  [ kristijonas donelaitis - metai ] ( http://old.antologija.lt/pdf/6.pdf ) ** / ** [ ( english translation ) ] ( http://www.lituanus.org/1964/64_1_02_metai.html ) ; [ wiki about it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_seasons_%28poem%29 ) i always liked this one by [ maironis ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/jonas_maciulis-maironis.jpg ) about the trakai castle ( sorry , i do n't have time to translate it right now ) : pel\u0117siais ir kerpe apaugus auk\u0161tai trak\u0173 \u0161tai garbinga pilis !, 
  pilis !, 
  i 'm not that knowledgeable in poetry though so my choices are pretty `` generic '' . 
  haha there 's no need for that :p i was just clarifying . 
  maybe for arts and crafts :d was it for halloween ? 
  i do n't remember if my class ever did . 
  no one carves pumpkins here . 
  well maybe some americanophiles do . 
  those are candles on graves . 
  op should have said happy all saint 's day tbh . 
  boy , did he enjoy his own joke . 
   220 people on the airplane ... fuck that ftfy, 
  i heard that it was his thumb so he just drew around it . 
  and how is that relevant to curonians and the other baltic tribes exactly ? 
   also we might think about offering a special formatting guide for non-english parts . 
  maybe similar to spoilertags other subs use . 
  that 's a great idea . 
  those spoiler bars would be instantly noticeable if used for non english . 
  the comment order would n't even be a problem then . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i like that it got made but i just expected more . 
  i would love an in depth documentary on the yotvingians . 
  it 's a big letdown to be honest . 
  when i watched it i felt like i did n't learn anything new that the trailer had n't covered already . 
   and dress up like it the dressing up part came first . 
  the tri-colour colours have been common in traditional dresses that 's why those colours have been chosen in addition to being easily replicated and to not look like a communist flag with a red field . 
  it 's not important but it is annoying to me . 
  reading and writing comments in a foreign language already requires to turn on a mental switch even if you are somewhat fluent in the language . 
  now read a whole tree of small one sentence comments and you get in this groove and suddenly you 're reading some comment that seems vaguely comprehensible and after reading like 3 internationally used words you realise that what you 're reading is a language that you have no grasp of . 
  it 's not a big deal but i would be lying if i said that sometimes when a thread is filled by such comments it does n't get frustrating to reread stuff . 
  if it were common practice and people kept switching up the order i assume that a lot of people would get annoyed . 
  again , it 's not a big deal but since the survey touched on the topic i shared my thoughts on the matter . 
  : if you would add latin translations to all of your sentences i would be so happy . 
  stay strong :d, 
  touche . 
  i totally forgot about that option .
