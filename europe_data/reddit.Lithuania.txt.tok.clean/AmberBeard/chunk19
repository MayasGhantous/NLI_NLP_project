  he paid for the first fortress there after the teutonic order destroyed whatever the old prussians had built there and that 's why it 's called `` king 's mountain '' in his honour  i think it 's still technically founded by the teutonic order though . 
  are you [ sure ? 
  i really like the image of mount ararat in the middle . 
  especially the cloud cap thingy detail . 
  looks like it could be a logo for just about anything . 
   he mistook its population for estonia 's he did n't . 
  he got those stats from the governor of k\u00f6nigsberg in july ( in an obviously scripted interaction ) . 
  if anything the governor mistook it with estonia ( which i doubt ) and putin keeps repeating it to try to portray how awesome ussr was and that no one was emigrating from it . 
  you get the idea . 
  basically implying how shitty life is outside of russia and ussr . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://en.delfi.lt/central-eastern-europe/russias-population-drain-of-the-century.d?id=68638326 ) a story that mentions it . 
  ca n't argue with that , 
  true . 
  ca n't stop russians going on `` vacations '' . 
  i do n't exactly follow how the whole evidence thing is going so i ca n't comment on that . 
  not sure about the credibility but did n't the ukrainian government publish something about high ranking russian military personnel being involved in this ? 
  surely , high ranking officers ca n't claim the same volunteer excuse . 
  that 's what i was referring to , yes , 
  you 're just being picky for no reason . 
  should the french stop calling germany allemagne because it 's `` old and out of date '' ? 
  or are they all so *** gasp *** anti-german ?!!, 
   russia has a right to have troops on its own borders . 
  i agree . 
  and i agree to your whole post . 
  i would n't have mentioned it if putin had said the exact thing but he did n't . 
  he answered a question with a question and then skipped over the original one . 
  that and to my knowledge us troops are not engaging in active warfare on european soil . 
  putin completely glossed over this part :  [ ... ] and some argue that there have been russian troops in ukraine itself . 
  that and the lithuanian version is a literal translation of the german name so it just feels weird calling it differently . 
  to me at least . 
  renaming shit just because you feel like it and have deported the original inhabitants from there by force seems dumb to me , sorry . 
  i like that name better than kaliningrad . 
  or i could say it in lithuanian as karaliau\u010dius if that 's better for you . 
  i ca n't speak for estonia or latvia but if he 's so eager to single out lithuania with his bullshit stats then why not name the exact country where it 's happening . 
  or maybe specific instances . 
  i doubt there are any though . 
  wait ... are you making a joke that russia will invade the baltics and there will be only 1.4 million lithuanians left after the invasion ? 
  from the kremlin link :  and what is it now ? 
  i have looked though the recent statistics , today the population of this country is 1.4 mln people . 
  this recent statistic from k\u00f6nigsberg has made the rounds in our media when they were first published . 
  i 'm at work so i ca n't check if the video of the interview covers this part since it 's not in the text version but here 's the cbs [ link . 
  ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/vladimir-putin-russian-president-60-minutes-charlie-rose/ ) here 's the kremlin [ link ] ( http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/50380 ) that covers it in text among other things . 
  love this part :  charlie rose : russia has military presence on the borders with ukraine , and some argue that there have been russian troops in ukraine itself . 
   vladimir putin : do you have a military presence in europe ? 
  * but what about you guys ?!!, 
  * putin later continues to cry about how russians are discriminated in the baltics . 
   hint at something water based it does indeed relate to `` to spill '' but not really related to water i 'd say . 
  lithuania is the name of a political tribal union of the lithuanian highland tribes and the most obvious and most sense making etymology is that `` lietuva '' means `` a molded result ( of a tribal union ) '' . 
  it 's more related to smelting and spilling molten metal into a mold or something like that . 
  maybe that lithuania is the mold itself even . 
  yet no one ever seems to mention this . 
   have to be a pedantic linguist to really care that much i do n't see how seeking the truth is being pedantic rather than just blindly rehashing something , based off a poem no less , just because it rhymes . 
  would you take an explanation for your country 's etymology with such stride even if it were wrong and you knew it but it just sounded nice because it rhymed a little ? 
  also in the poem it goes '' \u010cia lietuva . 
  which translates to `` this is lithuania . 
  it rains here . 
  field . 
  butterflies swim . 
  while lithuania - is my best friend '' . 
  it does n't really rhyme but sounds bouncy like in a song in lithuanian if you know what i mean . 
  you can hopefully see that even in the little context of the poem that i have provided that the author is n't even presenting an explanation for one or the other just saying that rain happens here . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i like that little phrase . 
  i mean ... it even rhymes kind of . 
  i just do n't like people quoting it who do n't even know that it 's from a poem and basically spreading false information . 
  then some people start thinking that it 's legit because they found it to be an endearing explanation  the media does n't help as well of course often writing that something happens `` in the land of rain '' . 
  imo it 's nice mythology to have but it should not creep into the collective psyche as fact . 
   the sense i got from speaking with lithuanians was that depression is a national pastime i 'd say that you 've met some overly melodramatic lithuanians or you took their morbid sense of humor a little bit too much to heart . 
   just came back from a trip to lt hope you had a great time and will return some day  cheers . 
  no one cares about completely exterminated people . 
  with a usurped name no less . 
  we lost one brother before . 
  we 're not losing another one !, 
  that 's a low bar to set . 
  i 'm well aware of the belarussian history revisionism do n't worry . 
   not true - the term was not used `` specifically by slavic peoples it is true in regards to what i 'm talking about . 
  i do n't know what else to tell you . 
  we 're talking about different things i think and you 're taking it as an outrageous affront . 
   the country was called `` litwa \\ \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432a '' by the slavic peoples , thus the citizens of the country -- ruthenians , ukrainians , poles , samogitians , ethnic lithuanians , etc -- were all litwins . 
  you just contradicted yourself and i hope you 'll see why ... just because slavic people called lithuania litwa that does not mean that lithuanians were `` litwins '' . 
  again , i ca n't stress this enough , ** you are just using literal translations for terms ** . 
  it 's not how this works . 
  more on that later . 
   and that translates to `` lithuanians '' ( = citizens of gdl ) in english . 
  correct . 
   if you claim that `` litwins '' were ruthenians , then how were ethnic lithuanians called ? 
  do you really think samogitians or lithuanians were calling themselves `` litwinas '' ( or \u017demaitis ) ? 
  because they were n't . 
  lithuanians called themselves how they call themselves now - `` lietuvis '' ( or at least since the 12th or 13th century ) . 
  this is what i 'm talking about . 
   desperate belarussian pseudo-histories are working hard to push this narrative , but it is not to be taken seriously . 
  i think you 're too eager to see historic revisionism where there * might * be none . 
  slavic people ( or others ) living in the gdl ( and thus being citizens of the dutchy of lithuanians ) were all technically `` lithuanians '' ( or as you put it `` lithuania = lietuva = \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430 = litva = litwa = litauen = litvania , et cetera '' ) , i 'm not arguing about that . 
  although i could expand on that . 
  i 'm saying that there 's a clear distinction of ruthenians who were citizens of gdl calling themselves litwins and jews who were citizens of gdl calling themselves litwaks . 
  it 's like the whole mess about who do you mean when saying `` brits '' or when people refer to the united kingdom as english . 
  the problem arises because `` lietuva '' is in itself the name of a union of baltic tribes that later morphed into an identity . 
  you can not simply say that everyone were litwins when talking about the gdl without adding a huge asterix to the whole thing . 
  do you understand the difference ? 
  i 'm not talking about bureaucratic stuff where the literary language was slavic and everyone was a litwin ( = citizen ) .
