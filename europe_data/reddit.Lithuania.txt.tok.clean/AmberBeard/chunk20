   '' < ...  which was a region of the commonwealth ( litva ) , which region is now mostly belarus and lithuania . '', 
  if this is not hinting at how lithuania is not the successor of gdl , then i don ' know what it is . 
  i think he and i are talking about different periods . 
  i 'm talking about gdl pre-royal union with poland . 
  he 's clearly talking about a period after ukraine ( or at least what is now known as ) was passed on to poland . 
  after union of lublin the gdl was pretty much what is now lithuania + belarus . 
  i do n't understand how you see a problem there . 
   he basically saying that there was ( gd of ) litva and now there is ( republic of ) lithuania . 
  this `` region of the commonwealth '' was called gd of lithuania and there is no such thing as `` great duchy of litva '' . 
  end of the story . 
  well , call me stupid then because i do n't see the revisionism . 
  go ahead , quote him where he explicitly says `` there is no such thing as `` great duchy of litva '' . 
  he does n't and i would recommend that you would n't make wild assumptions before clear statements have been made . 
  and again you 're contradicting yourself . 
  first you say `` he basically saying that there was ( gd of ) litva '' and then you say `` there is no such thing as `` great duchy of litva '' . 
  which is it ? 
  i * know * he did n't say either of those things but which one did he imply in your opinion ? 
  the people in this thread with polish flair trying to claim historical figures of questionable identity as polish are a whole different matter . 
   campaigners say leaked documents show ` undue influence ' by the food industry after plans to limit acrylamide - found in starchy foods such as crisps , cereals and ** baby foods ** - are weakened seems to be not just in junk food . 
  it truly is uncanny how russia keeps exceeding expectations in that regard . 
  sounds like you focus too much on the days that you do n't like . 
  i personally get enough of every kind of weather while living in lithuania to the point of getting sick of a specific weather because it seems that it never ends ( until a different season rolls in ) . 
  because it 's not even a hypothesis  it 's a line from a poem that has become a meme . 
  also , you should n't use `` literally '' and then put a disclaimer contradicting yourself by stating that there is no clear origin . 
  so , not literally , not a hypothesis and no problem  . 
   just like it is all day every day in rainithuania i do n't know where you are but it has rained for 2 days here max ( 3 days if you count drizzle ) and it has been a very dry autumn this year in general . 
  it 's not . 
  please stop spreading this . 
  litvin was how ruthenians called themselves in the gdl . 
  sure , it does literally mean lithuanian but it was used specifically by slavic peoples . 
  jews for example called themselves litwaks . 
  those words are not just literal translations , over time they became terms . 
  and terms carry certain context . 
  that 's all . 
  okay , it 's late and maybe my brain is n't working right and maybe that guy before was really hinting at how lithuania is not the successor of gdl . 
  i 've just had this coversation before more than i would care to and it 's a knee jerk reaction by now . 
  you 're completely misunderstanding the point being made by others . 
  and judging from the downvotes they got looks like you 're not the only one . 
  the term `` litvin '' has nothing to do with the interwar period . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  there are distinctions to be made . 
  you could always contribute you know . 
  a very refreshing concept , indeed . 
  i like this guy . 
  we do n't need european immigrants coming over and taking our engineering jobs !, 
  there is plenty context to add to all of the things you 've mentioned . 
  it would be intellectually dishonest to not include the context . 
  yeah , but drop outs is a whole different ball game , would n't you agree ? 
  btw if you downvoted me for going along with your devil advocacy then why did you even bother starting the discussion ? 
   i was just worried that it can take a path which turkey took , ie denial/downplaying , you should n't assume . 
  there 's absolutely no denial in lithuania . 
  some people might want to add context to the situation though . 
  like most things in history it 's not black and white . 
  someone should start segregating dudes who have facial hair from those who shave . 
  i know i get beard envy sometimes . 
  i ca n't concentrate then !, 
  i 'll agree that it probably outright removes a major distraction , however , if you ca n't concentrate on your task during a lecture just because people of the opposite sex are in the same room then you probably would n't concentrate if someone was wearing a red shirt in the room as well . 
  saudi arabia as # 2 sums it up . 
   if someone said that it was `` as hot as hell '' would you complain that hell is far hotter and they should stop being condescending ? 
  no , i would n't and it 's a pretty bad example to try to get your point across . 
   people are down voting because it is a completely unessesary response to what is an extremely common turn of phrase . 
  `` irregardless '' is also a common word but for some reason if people correct someone when they use it then it 's okay . 
  it 's not a big deal but ** i personally ** find it annoying . 
  i guess it 's unacceptable to find some phrase annoying in front of you guys . 
  god forbid that someone thinks that a self contradicting phrase is self contradicting . 
  okay , so you admit that it 's a silly matter but i ca n't point it out ? 
  and what am i derailing exactly ? 
  it 's all in the headline . 
  there 's nothing to discuss really . 
  congratulations to the queen and i wish her continued health . 
  maybe i should n't have called it `` counter arguements '' but if the mere act of asking people to express their opinions that are obviously in contradiction to my own if they are going to downvote me warrants me getting downvoted then i hope you do n't hold any position of power in your life . 
  it 's just a self-contradicting expression which i find to be condescending . 
  i do n't see what the big deal is and why people downvoted me for it . 
  it 's a silly thing to say and i find it annoying . 
  my feelings could be summed up in two words which are `` mild annoyance '' . 
  it 's hardly taking it too seriously imo  if anything people who are downvoting me for expressing my feelings without offering any counter argument are taking it too seriously . 
  but i guess i 'll get downvoted for this comment as well . 
  i have heard this oxymoron of gaining youth with age before . 
  maybe it 's just me but all hints of `` respectable age '' go out the window when i hear that stupid expression . 
  it sounds so condescending to me . 
  like when people tell little kids how big and mature they are . 
   90 years young i hope this is sarcasm . 
  that 's what you get for having australia in eurovision . 
  i expect venomous snake sightings shortly after straya wins . 
  this makes me wonder if there 's overlap in cuisine in regards to spain - mexico , portugal - brazil , france - canada and so on . 
  `` french '' fries do n't count . 
  i just have to ask . 
  are you upset ironically ? 
   it 's just a transitional dialect of polish . 
  they 're 4th with 9 % . 
  vote for smetona or some grand duke then . 
  which also means that you should n't be annoyed about it as well :p, 
   we just get a bit annoyed when you insist us being baltic . 
  we 've been over this before . 
  you 're honorary . 
  udija at it again . 
  your delusion is impressive , there 's no denying that . 
  oh , do n't worry . 
  i 'm laughing :d, 
   wilno nasze showing your true colours i see ,
