  if they were hooligans just looking for a fight or if they were xenophobes looking to inflict pain and to terrify an immigrant is irrelevant . 
  the point is that with ganging up on an unsuspecting guy 1 vs 20 just for a laugh or to get some point across of `` we 're better than poles '' is cowardly behaviour . 
  you are never in danger when attacking some random dude with 19 other guys . 
  it 's textbook pissypants bitchboy pseudo-tough guy behaviour . 
  there 's nothing brave in their actions . 
  ** and their degeneracy is not in question here . 
  **  again it 's not about some sort of glorious hand to hand combat with bravery and honour , it 's about hurting somebody and taking joy in their paid . 
  do n't mistake sadism for simplicity . 
  you 're the one talking about bravery and assuming that i 'm talking about some gentleman 's code of conduct during a duel over here . 
  other than assaulting someone being reprehensible behaviour , i 'm just saying that attacking 1 guy while you have 19 friends with you is a bitch move . 
   again that 's not how the world works - the ` bullies are all weak cowards ' is something people tell themselves to make themselves feel better . 
  some people are just wired differently and that sadism is infectious . 
  i never said they were weak . 
  oh and i guess i do n't live in the real world then . 
  am i in the matrix ? 
  because apparently personal life experience is meaningless when talking to you . 
  other than your own of course . 
   i just think you have n't encountered genuinely evil people , the real depths of humanity . 
  wow ... well , you are free to think that . 
  i guess not everyone is as lucky to see the ** real ** depths of humanity whatever that means . 
   it really does n't . 
  it just shows that they did n't in one instance . 
  sure , as far we know the 20 person gaggle of mindless drones has engaged in this kind of behaviour only once . 
  please do tell how many times does a person need to behave in a cowardly or spineless way to be called a coward or spineless then ? 
  do you need to murder someone more than once to technically be a murderer ? 
  i really do n't understand your reasoning here . 
   these sort of issues would be much easier to solve you were right . 
  what 's to solve here exactly ? 
  20 teens assaulted a man while in some mob mentality induced rage . 
  if there were only 2 of them i bet they would have thought twice about it . 
  if it were just 1 vs 1 it would most likely never happen . 
  these kind of people are simpletons who only do something when they 're a majority . 
  they 're bullies and bullies are always pussies when they do n't have a buddy by their side . 
   it 's street violence , not a fantasy novel . 
  did i say that the article was fictional or something ? 
  i love it how you keep assuming like i have n't experienced violence in my life . 
  the real world also has genocide . 
  what 's your point ? 
  what major pussies . 
  talk about a glass cannon . 
  totally neglected defensive stats . 
  i 'll set my alarm clock earlier next time !, 
  sorry fam , got held up protecting an undefended poland . 
  thanks for the info :p, 
   how sausage is called in different languages ? 
  someone , please . 
  we need to know . 
  the blond guy is the mayor . 
  no idea about the rest . 
  that 's the single most frenchiest word i 've ever heard . 
   more popular than the red commie ones did n't you know that vytis rides in a red field of ( red ) potatoes ? 
  it even says so in wikipedia maaan :  article 15 of the constitution of lithuania , approved by national referendum in 1992 , stipulates , `` the coat of arms of the state shall be a white vytis on a red field ** of potatoes ** '' . 
  heraldic shield features the field ** of potatoes ** gules ( red ) with an armoured knight on a horse salient argent ( white ) . 
  the knight is holding in his dexter hand a sword argent above his head . 
  a shield azure hangs on the sinister shoulder of the knight with a double cross or ( yellow ) on it . 
  the horse saddle , straps , and belts are azure . 
  the hilt of the sword and the fastening of the sheath , the stirrups , the curb bits of the bridle , the horseshoes , as well as the decoration of the harness , are or ( gold ) . 
  feel free to love lithuanians more than sometimes . 
  just do it secretly to avoid weird looks . 
  ireland can into russian sphere of influence !, 
  so it was your fault !, 
  * rabble rabble rabble *, 
  not probably . 
  it is . 
  i remember there was an earthquake in lithuania . 
  looked it up and it was in 2004 . 
  it was a 4 on the scale and the recurrence was a 5,1 . 
  it was on the news for like a week and my classmate 's dad was on the news talking about it . 
  i think he was a seismologist . 
  he also had a thick mustache so i always remember him when i see randy marsh from south park . 
  i see . 
  thanks for the info . 
  those are some massive bullets btw if they were that size originally . 
  what are those cylinder things attached to the chest area and what 's the point of them ? 
  i keep reading the town name as armistice :|, 
  the difference is that governmental rules do n't contradict each other . 
  and are just reasonable in general in most countries . 
  goes to show how silly it all is , does n't it ? 
  well , like i said before in this thread i do n't really have a strong opinion about the whole burkini thing . 
  on one hand religious indoctrination and peer pressure kind of prevents the women to have an unbiased will to wear or not to wear the hijabs , burkinis or what have you ( i do n't really know which is which apart of the obvious burkini one ) . 
  and on the other hand a dress code at the beach sounds silly . 
  i 'm leaning towards religious clothing being silly altogether though . 
  there 's probably more to it than that which i wo n't pretend to be knowledgeable about or interested in atm . 
  makes them hypocrites all the same . 
  is n't all of it the word of god ? 
  kind of obvious that it 's all or nothing . 
  how many times do i have to say that i 'm not talking about her specifically ? 
  i do n't have an opinion on these stupid birkinis one way or the other . 
  here let me break it down for you : * do religious people cherry pick their dogma ? 
  yes . 
  all of them . 
  because religious texts are inherently contradictory and impossible to follow 100 % . 
  * does that make them hypocritical ? 
  yes . 
  if you consider something the word of god yet you follow some rules but not the others that is a double standard . 
  * do you have to be religious to behave hypocritically ? 
  everyone will behave in a hypocritical way sometime . 
  has to do with psychology . 
  self preservation mechanisms and all that . 
  again with the `` so ? '' ...
