  since when are double standards okay ? 
   was she personally doing it ? 
  did i say that she was ? 
  i do n't know and i do n't care . 
  and it does n't matter in ** this ** discussion . 
  you know why ? 
  ** because we 're talking about a general trend . 
  **  how can you justify believing that the actions of anyone in a group represent every single person in that group ? 
  i never did that . 
   sunni islam does n't have a central authority like the pope for catholics . 
  the community 's imam is the authority a muslim would care about . 
  islam is as anarchic as it gets . 
  it 's a political religion of extreme opposites which in itself is fascinating . 
  okay . 
  i have nothing to say about this . 
   there is no hypocrisy here . 
  you want to dictate what the personal faith of another person should be based on some superficial prejudice of yours . 
  so wait . 
  if i have rules that apply to me but does n't apply to someone else but i get upset that they do n't listen to those rules even though i myself use loop holes that would not make me a hypocrite ? 
  please do tell where i even imply that i want to dictate how other people live their lives . 
  what caught my eye is you saying `` so ? '', 
  to religious people cherry picking . 
  if expecting people to obey their own rules makes me prejudice then i do n't think we have anything to talk about . 
   i know your sort . 
  i have plenty of pious catholic family who would like to dictate how i live my atheist life . 
  everybody must be pigeonholed and whacked in . 
  i do n't know , i did not say that and i was not talking about her . 
  to my understanding this particular comment branch was talking about a general trend of religious people cherry picking what they like and do n't like in their religion when elmer took offense to that for whatever reason . 
  i have no strong opinion about burkinis , but let 's not pretend that religious people do n't accuse others of being sinners and infidels worthy of being killed and then suffering torture ** forever ** while doing something that is against their own religion at the same time . 
  i was addressing the hypocrisy and the inane question of `` so ? '', 
  that was attributed to it . 
  what do you mean so ? 
  since when is being a hypocrite warrant such an impotent comeback as `` so ? '' . 
  also , i doubt that your son is accosting other people for wearing bikinis or shirtless + swim trunks because it 's `` sinful '' . 
  you 're missing the point entirely . 
  they 're talking about religious people not following their own rules yet demanding other people who do not follow their religion to adhere to the same stupid rules that they themselves do not follow 100 % . 
  fair enough . 
  i do . 
  but it tries too much imo . 
  there are 3 portugals as well . 
  this map is giving me a headache . 
  i think i hate it now . 
  this map is so weird and confusing . 
  what is `` the other one '' referring to in the `` plucky little poland '' territory ( located in finland ... ) ? 
  sweden technically is a 3rd world country . 
  i see what you did there , guy . 
  [ yup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cepelinai ), 
  what a redundant thread . 
  so , everyone except hungary ? 
  i believe the phrase `` username checks out '' has never been more relevant . 
  meanwhile , as you wait for your armada to block out the sun , you should visit lithuania and try our cuisine . 
  we have edible zeppelins . 
  it 's in the style of / r/latvianjokes /, 
  pretty recently . 
  i have n't seen it in person . 
  not even when it was new . 
  but i saw a picture of the painted over graffiti in a lithuanian atheist group , i think . 
  the person who posted it was suggesting that it was vandalized by theists . 
  and i say vandalized because i think it is/was painted on the building of the restaurant that the billboard it advertising in this thread . 
  not completely sure though because i never visited . 
  chill , it 's a joke . 
  i think so , but the faces have been painted over . 
  i think technically it has been vandalized . 
  i had the same thought . 
  it 's not even a caricature . 
  they 're using his real image . 
  i think they are the same guys who did the putin + trump graffiti thing that went viral . 
  i think he already had it at this point and was going for silver or gold . 
  i assume , anyway . 
  it is for me :d but lots of people are complaining . 
  indeed , this summer is rather cool . 
  lots of rain . 
  i think the comment by / u/eff5850528 sums it up pretty well . 
  please do n't assume that if the weather is in the 10-17 range in riga at the moment that it is like that every year . 
  well 35 \u00b0 c sounds like a deathwish to me but you do n't see me asking how he does n't just spontaneously bursts in flames . 
  not many do . 
  it 's called bad weather . 
  summers are usually a lot warmer here than 15 \u00b0 c. 
  are you serious ? 
  the welsh are on the other side of the map :p, 
  well , you see , pagan magic requires lots of goat sacrifices . 
  i do n't know anyone my age who uses whatsapp or telegram or kik or anything else . 
  most used skype but once everyone went to fb no one is online in skype anymore . 
  not to mention that skype went to shit when microsoft bought it . 
  oh , and no one uses fb to get pussy here , or at least not in the same way how i think things happen in other places . 
  if people do n't know you when you send a friend invite you will get rejected and if you pm someone who is n't your friend they will not respond . 
  there are `` let 's get to know people '' groups where people exchange fb friendships but from what i understand people in other countries just see a cute girl on fb and they pm her . 
  that shit does n't fly here . 
  when i was in university i would hear female course mates laughing how they got messages from random turkish/spanish/italian exchange students . 
  never heard them say anything about those guys other than that they came of as creepy . 
  maybe the younger generation is different . 
  there was ( i think still is ) a popular lithuanian social network where everyone used it as a dating site even though it technically was n't , i think . 
  i never used it . 
  so when fb came along and everyone started using their real names it came of as very official so everyone ended up behaving more or less :d oh , and there are actual lithuanian dating sites as well . 
  i have n't tried it so ca n't comment in that respect , but if you like a quarter millennia old fermented fish i wo n't tell you to stop liking it :d, 
   stupid friends everyone uses fb here . 
  i wish everyday for an alternative . 
  i deleted my account like twice already but keep coming back because friends are impossible to reach without it now . 
  oh , and most events and groups worth knowing about are posted on fb as well : /, 
  this adds a substantial amount of nastiness to hakarl .
