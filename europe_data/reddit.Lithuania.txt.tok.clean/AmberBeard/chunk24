  i did n't think it was possible . 
  hey , it happens . 
  a brainfart is a horrible thing to experience . 
  haha , no problem . 
  :d i thought you were trolling at first . 
  let 's blame / u/executivemonkey . 
  i 'm lithuanian :| and honestly , i 'm mediocre when it comes to beer knowledge . 
  that opening sentence of the article was just so outlandish that even i went `` wtf '' . 
  well i do n't know any latvian beers . 
  so i guess we 're even :d, 
  trade ya for some canadian beer :3, 
   without a doubt , the global craft beer movement has arrived in the nordic and baltic countries . 
  stopped reading after this . 
  well , obviously because reasons . 
  you ca n't escape perk\u016bnas , pal . 
  one of us , one of us , one of us !, 
  just stop fighting it , man . 
  join us , join us , join us . 
  judging by the headline it seems like the author of the piece has been living under a rock for like a decade . 
  this is great !, 
  thanks for sharing . 
  okay . 
  well , as i said before , it is most likely that `` ponas '' came from `` pan '' so it 's the same source , 
  ca n't say for sure because it 's hard to find a reliable source on the etymology of that particular word . 
  most search results return various articles with formal speech in them or it 's some character from greek mythology . 
  the most likely answer imo would be that , yes '' ponas '' came from the polish '' pan '' . 
  just because it 's a term and the administrative language at the time was polish . 
  do n't know if you meant if it came from some ** other ** indo european source or not but if you did n't then know that saxonic is also indo european . 
  good question . 
  i 'm not entirely sure because of some interchangeable terms . 
  had to look it up . 
  looks like the terms for nobility ( besides dukes ) in lithuania started with a borrowing from rus ' . 
  which is now `` bajorai '' or '' \u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0438\u043d '' in russian . 
  which itself seems to come from further east , namely turkic peoples . 
  the term `` bajorai '' ( not `` ponai '' ) was later replaced with '' \u0161l\u0117kta '' due to polish influence but then came back in favour when the lithuanian language started getting standardized and removing lots of barbarisms . 
  as far as `` ponai '' goes , looks like it was some special term for `` bajoras / \u0161l\u0117kta '' who were a part of sejm after the union of lublin . 
  but at some point later in time the term `` bajoras '' got downgraded to meaning `` someone working at a noble 's house '' . 
  so i assume that all the nobility became `` ponas '' at that point . 
  nowadays '' \u0161l\u0117kta '' is archaic , `` ponas '' is formal speak like `` sir '' , `` bajoras '' references medieval nobility moreso than `` ponas '' does but the terms are more or less interchangeable i think . 
  oh , and there 's also `` tamsta '' for formalities . 
  which morphed from a transliteration ( `` tavo mylista '' ) from polish `` twoja milos\u0301c\u0301 '' which i assume was something like addressing in the english language to monarchy with `` your grace '' . 
  the term `` tamsta '' is semi archaic though and not used much anymore other than referring to a popular musical instruments retailer with that name . 
  so , as you can see , it 's pretty messy . 
  pon + the appropriate suffix depending on the context . 
  ponai ir ponios - ladies and gentlemen ( only the genders are reversed in those phrases ) . 
  a relic from the commonwealth i assume . 
  not really . 
  so if the nazis had sent someone to space it would have negated the holocaust ? 
  get out of here with that bullshit . 
  what does sending someone to space have anything to do with it ? 
  the comparison is not in the space race . 
  the comparison is about crimes against humanity . 
  and guess what ? 
  it 's a photo finish . 
  last time i heard about this game i really wanted to try it but every single version i found for android sucks . 
  you 're honorary balts though !, 
  be proud ;d, 
   `` vilnius is ours and we 're russia 's . '', 
  ftfy, 
   where am i being a soviet apologist ? 
  how about the whole history revisionism that you yourself are so against ? 
  `` soviets the liberators '' is exactly the kind of thing that you 're namecalling others being butthurt over . 
  if that 's that soviet apologism then i do n't know what is . 
  only way it would be more clear if you said that stalin did nothing wrong . 
   i think the ussr was bad , but saying that it was worse or the same as fascist occupation , as you do did i ? 
  please quote where i say that . 
   is something unaccepptable by modern civilizational standards . 
  you do realize that different regimes had different affects on different countries and nationalities right ? 
  the way you say that by modern civilizaton standards ( as if there 's some rigid standard on calculating which regime was worse ) nazis were worse than soviets just makes you a hypocrite . 
  you 're implying that any country that has suffered more by the soviets and thus regard soviets worse than nazis are somehow `` less than '' ( or should i say untermensch to keep the theme going ? ), 
  because other countries or nationalities suffered more because of the nazis and they think that the nazis were worse . 
  you being so offended over the fact that some people have suffered under the soviets more than under the nazis and putting more emphasis on the former just makes you hypocrite . 
  because i get the impression that because croatians suffered more under the nazis , you are willing to disregard the suffering of the people who experienced suffering under anything else . 
  modern civilization my ass . 
   equating nazi occupation and soviet takeover is likewise close to nazi apologism . 
  so nazi apologism = bad , but soviet apologism = good ? 
  got it . 
  thanks for clearing that up !, 
  more like 5 hours . 
  saw people saying that a mirror was up in 4-5 hours on pcmasterrace . 
  pretty sure a low functioning mirror went up like 4-5 hours after the original went down . 
  sydney is missing then . 
   poland gets around more than i thought they would . 
  it was called the ** common ** wealth for a reason . 
   any chance you 'd `` heard '' it here ? 
  sure , pal . 
  i just make shit up as i go . 
  no , i heard it on some podcast . 
  edit : also i do n't visit that shitty sub . 
  i 've heard that some study stated that having women around changes the groups dynamics in a military setting ( like everywhere else i guess ) . 
  meaning the men in the group start subconsciously favouring the females . 
  that includes increased risk taking . 
  basically just having women around endangers the troops . 
  unless you have all female regiments ( or however they 're called ) . 
  that 's the only argument that i am aware of that supports restriction of women in the front lines even if they meet the requirements . 
  i have no idea if that study is reputable or if there are more than one such study . 
  the only undead mammal as well !, 
  you still got vampires , though . 
  no way :o, 
  it 's a cultural and business exchange type of project .
