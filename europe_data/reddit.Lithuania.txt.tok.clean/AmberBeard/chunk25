  to my knowledge the construction of the `` vilnius home '' in moscow has stalled ( or has n't even started ) due to some shady shit and the mayor of vilnius said that the `` moscow home '' construction will be put on delay until there 's some progress on that front in moscow . 
  i could be wrong . 
  i was hoping for a follow up by him !, 
  also , for some reason his accent really tickles me . 
  probably because of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oowiosweszo ) . 
  incest ? 
  ditto , more or less . 
  also that he * knew * it . 
   i can hear ~ ~ their ~ ~ voices in my head . 
  how long has this been happening ? 
  i 'd say they 're more enraging than anything else . 
  only after you become one . 
  ( i know you were joking  ), 
  i guess they took the saying `` better out than in '' a bit too much to heart ? 
  was about to ask the same . 
  i feel left out ;(, 
  you just lost any semblance of credibility as a rational person . 
  and way to go proving my point about the whole perpetual victim thing . 
   a tragedy lithuanians and lithuanians alone were responsible for . 
  that statement could n't be further from the truth . 
  it 's akin to libel . 
  if lithuanians had their independence it would n't have happened . 
  i 'm sure that concept is foreign to you since you clearly think all lithuanians are scum of the earth just for existing . 
  and if you wan na go by blaming every person in history of lithuania for what a certain part of that group did then i can assure you that individual jews have done far worse throughout history than lithuanians ( source : torah/old testament ) . 
  so if you wan na be consistent with this stupidity of yours then make sure to cry about that as well . 
   yes , i understand that lithuania was under an forced occupation ( although the germans were initally welcomed ) you clearly do not . 
   however , unlike poland or other countries , the local population rather the occupiers carried out the massacres . 
  so what 's your point exactly ? 
  is anyone denying this ? 
  other than implying that the whole population of lithuania was in on it of course . 
   lithuanian nationalists were responsible for the massacres just as much as the germans were . 
  again , what 's your point ? 
  no one sane is denying this . 
  are you implying that somehow lithuanians are naturally more anti semitic ? 
  should all lithuanians be purged for the actions of lithuanian opportunists in ww2 ? 
  or should every lithuanian from now on should grovel before every single jew they meet for something that they did n't do or do not condone ? 
  that 's some original sin and `` sins of your fathers '' bullshit right there . 
   as for your claim that ` robbing us of a tragedy ' , what a horrible thing to say , imagine if a german said that , ` the jews are robbing us of a tragedy ' or a turk said ` the armenians are robbing us of a tragedy ' , where is the outcry ? 
  haha , i knew you 'd be simply appalled by anyone even trying to empathize or share the tragedy . 
  ca n't have that now . 
  of course only the jews can be the victims of ww2 . 
  ca n't have it any other way . 
  60 million casualties in ww2 but only the 6 million are important . 
  and guess what , it ** was ** a tragedy for the german nation . 
  and it ** was ** a tragedy for the sane turks as a well . 
  you are naive to think that it was n't and if you honestly believe that it would be an outrage for a german to say that what happened in ww2 was a tragedy for germans as a whole then you truly are the pinnacle of `` look at me i 'm the victim '' . 
  ww2 was a collective tragedy for ** humanity ** . 
  same goes for the armenian genocide and the genocide in rwanda . 
  and any other massacre you can imagine . 
   you should be ashamed of yourself for making such a statement do n't fucking tell me how to feel . 
   the goal of which is to transform the aggressors into the victims do n't put words in my mouth . 
  if you keep perceiving everything as a slight directed at you then everything becomes one . 
  this is the last time that i tell you that `` no , that is absolutely not what i was trying to get across '' . 
   i suggest you search the holocaust in lithuania for more information about the local 's role . 
  i 'm well aware , thanks . 
   you 're blaming jews for antisemitism oh for fucks sake ... again with putting words in my mouth . 
  i was referring to an academic inquiry you perpetual victim . 
  do n't remember how it 's called to link you to wiki but i was referring to this list . 
  http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/why_do_people_hate_the_jews.htm  look , do you think it 's a coincidence that israel has such good relations with the western european countries ? 
  no , i do n't . 
  but i 'm sure you somehow believe that i implied otherwise . 
   here are what western european countries have done . 
  lovely . 
  implying that lithuania has n't done everything in what you have listed . 
  i 'll say it again because you so happily gloss over it every single time . 
  lithuania has done everything that you have listed . 
  lithuania 's first president issued a formal apology on behalf of lithuania in israel . 
  the point about memorializing war criminals that you so fondly like to focus on is non existent in lithuania . 
  sure there are/were plaques for partisans but you know what ? 
  the sketchy ones that ** were ** there , ** were ** there because no one knew of the persons involvement with persecuting jews . 
  once that comes into light the plaques get removed . 
  sure , maybe there are some up right now that might be sketchy but they 'll get removed if solid proof comes up . 
  they had some plaques and then removed them . 
  how could they ? 
   these are all symbolic steps , which the ee countries really have failed thus far , western europe should be looked as an example in regards to dealing with the past . 
  lovely once again . 
  i do n't know if there are some ee countries that have not done what you have listed but i love it that you expanded the whole discussion to ee because you obviously could n't have claimed those things for lithuania because , again , everything you listed has been fulfilled . 
  nevermind that lithuania is in northern europe . 
   as for your claim that jews were responsible for deportations , jews suffered heavily under stalin , probably more than lithuanians themselves so you 're saying because jews have suffered heavily under stalin then lithuanians deserved to be deported to gulags by individual jews ** before stalin was even born ** ? 
  * blaming the victim anyone * ? 
  but of course , how silly of me . 
  how could anyone have suffered as much , more or even at the same time when jews we 're in the vicinity . 
  forget i said anything . 
   however i see a difference between what stalin has done to jews and the magnitude of the crimes against humanity and total genocide which the germans and lithuanian collaborators have done . 
  sure , there 's a difference . 
  what 's your point ? 
  is it to gloss over any and all of my points ? 
  because you sure have succeeded in that . 
  you keep generalizing on how all lithuanians are responsible for other lithuanians collaborating with nazis . 
  but then in the same breath excuse jews collaborating with the russian empire because of stalin ???? 
  you 're a hypocrite . 
  i 'll take a note from your book and i 'll start thinking that all jews are like you from now on . 
  and if you want to have an idea of what lithuanians as a collective have done while under occupation and not having sovereignty or any autonomy then choke on [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_righteous_among_the_nations . ), 
  so in conclusion , you have thoroughly demonstrated that from now on until the end of time everyone has to grovel before any and all jews . 
  all and any kind of context and fact be damned . 
  and let me remind you that ** you ** went into this discussion positively * looking * to be offended . 
  some guy said that germans in comparison to soviets are loved in lithuania and we already went through that . 
  when comparing with the soviets lithuanians will love ebola . 
  then i said that love is a strong word to use when referring to nazis . 
  then mister `` i 'm offended because lithuanians exist '' shows up and implies that all lithuanians are holocaust deniers .
