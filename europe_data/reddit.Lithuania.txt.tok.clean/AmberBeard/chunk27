  you need to realize that even though a lot of lithuanian-jews died because of * that * little distinction it will never be a bigger outrage than the soviet regime in lithuania . 
  but acting as if the republic of lithuania is in full blown denial is n't going to improve our relations by one bit either . 
   our whole discussion is entirely based on opinions , i can not see why i should n't be able to dismiss them . 
  then why are you so upset when someone else disagrees with you , you hypocrite ? 
   we are . 
  we are in our current state due to our choices . 
  haha , yeah sure . 
  i 'm certain that you agree wholeheartedly with the corruption that led you to this situation . 
  go team . 
   the jews were unarmed civilians . 
  do n't even dare to compare them to your own organised states . 
  so the same rules do not apply to jews ? 
   they fought as well as they could with their primitive weaponry and lost . 
  the native americans deserve freedom because they fought for it and never gave up . 
  which one is it ? 
  native americans deserve freedom because they fought for it and never gave up but lithuanians fighting for their freedom and fighting guerrilla warfare for decades and doing whatever is necessary to survive ( even allying with the enemy of your enemy ) does n't count ? 
  hyyypocriteeee . 
   oh now you 're playing the `` offensive '' card ? 
  i 'm not being condescending . 
  i 'm being realsitic . 
  if you want to live in a world where you have no agency and no moral responsibility go lobotomize yourself and go back to kindergarten . 
  this is the real world . 
  you 're being completely unrealistic . 
  you know why ? 
  because you 're fantasizing about past events in some kind of alternative history video game scenario while obviously having little knowledge on the particular topic . 
  you 're a clown that lives in a fantasy world who likes to talk big on the internet and saying that it 's the real world . 
  it would be funny if it were n't sad . 
  if it 's true then it 's messed up . 
  but i kind of see how it could have developed . 
  how is it insulting to point out that you 're contradicting yourself ? 
  i did n't call you stupid . 
  you outright dismissing what anyone else has to say shows pretty clearly that you regard yourself as the ultimate authority on the current topic . 
  nevermind that all what you have said is very subjective opinion of what ifs . 
  master ? 
  what fantasy world do you live in ? 
  by your logic greece is worthy of its current economic state . 
  and who denied what ? 
  disagreeing with your subjective hindsight alternative history fantasies is just that . 
  disagreeing with you . 
  while you 're here preaching some kind of moral superiority . 
  should the jews have fought the nazis better as well ? 
  should the native americans have fought the europeans better ? 
  you have no idea how condescending and offensive you sound do you ? 
   i admit lithuania does n't have a good reputation oh , i 'm sure it does n't in your circles if that 's the only thing you reduce a nation to . 
   but i have n't seem the outcry when over 10 % of their population ( jews ) where murdered by lithuanians you have n't looked hard enough . 
  and of course lithuanians will complain more about the soviets when soviets are denying everything . 
  there is no denial about what happened with lithuanian-jews . 
  not officially at least . 
  and not by me anyway . 
  so i do n't appreciate being lumped in with morons who happen to be lithuanians in these kind of discussions . 
   it did n't help that lithuanians rather than germans did most of the murders . 
  close to 95 % iirc of lithuanian jews were murdered , these were n't foreigners these were your own citizens ffs . 
  exactly . 
  they were lithuanian citizens . 
  and if you for a second believe that it is not regarded as a tragedy ( albeit being somewhat neglected understandably due to the whole ** occupation ** that lasted 50 + years . ), 
  in lithuania then you 're just looking to be a victim . 
  i can say that it does n't help when people who have no context in the matter just gloss over the whole thing and go `` the jews ! '' . 
  ffs they were lithuanian-jews . 
  and it pisses me off how self serving some jews are when talking about ww2 . 
  everything gets reduced to 6 million jews . 
  if you did n't know any better you 'd think that those were the only casualties . 
  and if that 's not enough then the whole myth of jews being slaves in egypt gets brought up ad nauseam further perpetuating the the whole victim status which i despise . 
   i do n't think europe has the legitimacy to dictate to jews what is/isn ' t defined as anti-semitism . 
  then you have no legitimacy to have any kind of opinion about anything regarding europe . 
  i 'm sure you see how idiotic of me it would be to honestly claim that . 
  do n't pretend as if the term `` anti-semitism '' does n't get thrown around willy nilly sometimes . 
  i 'll grant you , however , that you probably hear the `` do n't pull the card '' a lot and i assume being used with malice . 
  that still does n't grant you the supreme authority on common knowledge terms . 
   i see this a lot , especially those whom truly believe in anti-semitic sentiments , then state the jews ` pull the antisemitism card for nothing ' , it 's disgusting to hear . 
  nothing i do n't agree with here . 
  only thing that comes to mind is how the russian government spews `` baltic states are russophobic '' . 
  i imagine some of your neighbours are equally retarded . 
  there 's a lot of context to go into that i wo n't pretend to be an expert of . 
  i can just provide you with some simple points to think about . 
  i noticed something that never gets addressed . 
  when lithuanians were in charge of their own country jews flourished . 
  since medieval times . 
  you know when everyone else were kicking jews out of their countries ( could be wrong about the timeline here though ) . 
  but when autonomy is stripped from lithuanians and everything goes to shit then somehow the burden is on us for not having opportunistic scumbags of our nationality in check . 
  this is what baffles me the most . 
  there are people like that everywhere . 
  and if shit goes down they will pop up . 
  hell , there are probably more holocaust deniers currently in america than there are lithuanians in the world . 
  okay , maybe that a huge overestimation but if for some reason the rule of law crumbled in america you can be sure that with all the guns available there would be a lot of racist , homophobic , anti-semetic stuff going down . 
  i do n't get how americans as a whole would be at fault . 
  if you judge a whole nationality by what a group does then anyone who has an ounce of german dna should be jailed for life . 
  there are straight up genocidal things that jews did in the old testament . 
  should you be held accountable for that ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  when lithuania did get its independence back our ** first ** president did go to israel and apologized on behalf of lithuania . 
  that 's another thing that does n't get mentioned ever . 
  which really begs the question if you just want to be regarded as a victim indefinitely . 
  i hope not . 
  and i do get a sense of frustration from your comment which i understand . 
  lastly , getting back to your original point that you 've encountered lithuanians who wo n't condemn the nazis etc. 
  i believe that you have . 
  there 's nothing more i can say about that . 
  but if you apply those experiences to every lithuanian that you meet then do n't be surprised when you are met in kind with hostility and we all know what happens when people want to insult each other . 
  they go for the worst thing imaginable that applies to the person that you want to insult . 
  and the holocaust is a low hanging fruit as far as insult go when targeting jews .
