  i 'm saying how what you say comes off because of the way you said it . 
   and though there are several explanations about this collaboration , the fact remains that it 's a shameful part of our history that we need to acknowledge . 
  which the huge majority of us do , thankfully . 
  i can say the exact thing for lithuania  i hope you 're not implying that there 's some kind of denial happening in lithuania . 
  because if you do then we have nothing else to talk about . 
   i added that it was also because there was a lot of antisemitism . 
  insisting on this : i wrote `` also '' , i did not deny that soviet repression was an explanation for locals welcoming nazis . 
  i only said it was n't the only reason . 
  and then you accused me of making a `` black and white '' statement . 
  okay . 
  you were very on point when you said that there are several explanations about the collaborations and the same can be said about anti-antisemitism in lithuania and all of europe during that time . 
  also , i noticed that you keep repeating that you 're not denying the soviet repressions etc. 
  i want to make it clear that i never once thought that you were doing that . 
  i apologize if it came off as an accusation but i still believe that you contradicted yourself then and i simply pointed it out . 
  [ i 'm dialing the number on the phone as i type this message . 
   oh i 'll fully admit that my knowledge in this matter is quite limited . 
  good . 
   but i still know that lithuania is the country which had the largest part of its jewish population exterminated ( basically , all of it ) sure , but as a juxtaposition i can say that i know that over 60 million people were killed in ww2 . 
  does that seem like a strange statement ? 
  well , the point that i 'm trying to make is that you 're clinging to a ( for lack of a better word ) statistic . 
  there are things to consider why what happened happened and why it happened the way that it did . 
  for example i can provide you a rather morbid thought experiment . 
  which would you think would take longer ? 
  to exterminate around 200,000 lithuanian jews while considering the matter a high priority or to exterminate 3,000,000 polish jews ? 
   and i also know that it was one of the few countries where the genocide started immediatement that is a fact and i do n't deny it . 
  but please define `` immediate '' . 
  relative to populations 10x bigger ? 
  or just the second the first nazi crossed the border in general ? 
  again , there are things to consider if you care about making intellectually truthful statements . 
   with the active help of the local population ( whereas in other countries the `` genocide '' part came at the end of the war ) . 
  see you 're framing it like 100 % were on board while in other places there were no collaborators . 
  it 's like saying that the french * always * surrender because it happened at a very critical time in history even though the french have one of the most formidable war records in the world . 
  of course collaborators will be active . 
  there were active help from local populations everywhere . 
  the scope and the motivations is what matter as well imo . 
   that does n't prevent lithuania from having been a country opressed by the ussr because these are two entirely different matters . 
  absolutely . 
   because these are two entirely different matters . 
  yet you 're the one mentioning both of them in parallel . 
   i mean , it 's also that they were insanely antisemitic and started murdering jews the second germans set a foot in lithuania . 
  if that 's not a sweeping statement then i do n't know what is . 
  like you said yourself it 's a matter of things not being black and white . 
  i 'm not saying that there was n't animosity towards jews but like from many people making similar points that you 're making i get the distinct feeling that you lack a more than a considerable amount of context of the matter . 
  sounds like it 's battery powered . 
  it 's a fact . 
  how can that guy be in such denial about facts ? 
  we 'll deal with you later , *** teuton *** . 
  i just wan na make sure there 's no misinterpretation of your words . 
   trust me , ** nobody is denying soviet occupation here !, 
  **  trust me , ** nobody is denying soviet occupation here !, 
  **  trust me , ** nobody is denying soviet occupation here !, 
  **  trust me , ** nobody is denying soviet occupation here !, 
  **  trust me , ** nobody is denying soviet occupation here !, 
   baltics have definitely been opressed , but the story is far from being black and white . 
  and yet you make a completely black and white statement in the same post . 
  lol . 
  good job . 
  i think this would have been a lot more interesting post if it was done in some text form about the history of the tradition with added photos instead of the got meme . 
   the oldest border in europe not trying to be a dick but is that really true ? 
  i 'm finding a lot of different results about `` oldest border in europe '' . 
  there 's obviously a definition lacking . 
  for example it says about portugal from a random article : `` having the same defined borders since 1249 , almost 800 years ago '' . 
  while for comparison the border between lithuania and latvia has been established in 1236 when the lithuanian state was established by mindaugas after the battle of saul\u0117 if i remember correctly . 
  now naturally this ignores russian occupation but the lithuanian-latvian border essentially did not face any changes to it even during the occupation . 
  what else should i be doing since you 're so keen on ordering me around for no reason ? 
   you 're not good at jokes * sees one throwaway tongue in cheek comment and says i 'm not good at jokes ( plural ) * you 're not great with logic yourself , buddy . 
  at least you 're up front about not being funny . 
  that 's exactly what i meant :p, 
  true enough . 
  i think i 'll have to put a disclaimer on every shitty joke i try to make around here from now on . 
  bunch of sensitive sallies . 
  clearly your dog loves you more than you it . 
   i fucking love lithuanians , no matter their weirdness . 
  ** you 're the one with 6 toes , maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan . 
  are you suggesting that i should unrustle my jimmies ? 
  *** [ triggered ] ***, 
  perk\u016bnas sees you . 
  happy independence day !, 
  yeah , i know . 
  i guess i should have changed it to something like `` thank god smell-o-vision \u2122 is not a thing on youtube '' . 
  i 'll do better next time !, 
   thank god smell-o-vision \u2122 has n't been invented yet . 
  you 're welcome . 
  2 municipalities in lithuania have lions as coat of arms .

  you take that back !, 
   russia sees everything from its own perception . 
  or as i like to put : russia 's foreign policy is projection . 
  great post altogether . 
  you first . 
  well now i 'm jealous . 
  most cool graffiti gets bullshit tags painted over them here . 
  maybe that 's just my impression because i do n't really pay attention but that 's how i see it . 
  i do n't have kids so i do n't wan na speculate on how i would feel about my hypothetical child being with some imaginary person . 
  it would probably depend on the person at the end of the day . 
  i would n't want my child to date a lithuanian who was a jackass . 
  i think those questions are silly . 
  most people have not interacted with a muslim , a black person , an asian or even a jew so asking them how they would feel just asks for people to start thinking in stereotypes . 
  at least we 're consistent lol, 
  but the cutesy cartoons wo n't get painted over ?
