  we can still feel the legacy of the roman empjre in map too but no one is saying that egypt is europe . 
  sent, 
  seems so . 
  i made a comment linking to a video of the incident but it 's on facebook so automod removed it . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's visible right now but i can pm you the link if you 're interested . 
   for some reason i have n't been getting notifications about him uploading something new , although i do have notifications turned on . 
  this seems to a common issue for many different types of youtubers lately . 
  really nice . 
  i hate most of them . 
  they 're shitty memes .

  because you should get over genocide . 
  it was just a prank , bro !, 
  the best part is that it 's russia 's foreign ministry 's ** official ** account posting this garbage . 
  same here :p, 
  i think it 's photoshopped . 
  clearly fake . 
  yes . 
  if you say so . 
  i have n't played it , just checked out the classes . 
  twangste reeeeeeee !!!, 
  there 's a mmorpg that has lots of lithuanian mythology . 
  a book smuggler class would fit right in . 
  it 's on the right side of the page .

  okay , so why did you feel the need to bring in us in a thread about * russia 's * salami tactics where someone made a remark that they did n't approve of * russia 's * foreign policy ? 
  does every thread have to devolve into `` oh yeah ? 
  well something unrelated happened sometime in history so it 's ironic that you say this because you 're a random guy from such and such who has no sway on what government officials of your country do '' ? 
  is this when i start bringing up negative things about germany ? 
  how about you flair up first before you call anyone on theirs . 
  now all that 's left is belarus . 
  hey !!!, 
  we saw them first !, 
  ( after kiev rus ' and the mongols ) . 
  they 're called glove compartments or gloveboxes , 
   a website called predatel.net , which translates as traitor.net , features a list of moscow intellectuals and others who are deemed to have betrayed their country , and invites readers to fill in a form and `` suggest a traitor '' to add to the list . 
  eerily similar to the soviet-era useful idiot hobby of snitching on your neighbours . 
  i wish we had a raised relief map in the sitebar . 
   you 're not made of sugar we use that one too !, 
  haha , it included the zidane headbutt too . 
  how dare you ? 
  it looks inviting .

  heresy !!!, 
   milk kefiiiiiiir, 
  okay , here goes . 
  i get mixed up in this constantly myself . 
   belarus ( also called belorussia * formarly * called . 
  and it 's not called that anymore i believe . 
  or at the very least it should n't . 
  i 'll get to that . 
   in more archaic english called white russia & white ruthenia ) means white rus ' i do n't know if that 's true but if it is then it was incorrect because russia = / = ruthenia . 
  i think it 's mostly due to the apostrophe in rus ' . 
  it denotes the [ soft sign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soft_sign ) . 
   rus ' is basically the old fashioned name of russia not that simple and i would say it 's the other way around . 
  that russia is the modern spin-off from rus ' . 
  muscovites were part of kievan rus ' and citizens of rus ' called themselves `` russian '' or ruthenian in latin but more specifically '' of rus ' '' and that 's an important distinction because it 's spelled differently than what russians called themselves in russian today ( '' \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 '' ( russkiye ) vs '' \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0435 '' ( rossiyane ) which might be considered as synonyms nowadays . 
  the difference becomes apparent when you realize that the current name for russia came from the byzantine greek designation of the kievan rus ' , `` ross\u00eda '' . 
  it 's u vs o sounds and soft sign vs no soft sign . 
  calling the realm or those lands as russian would be incorrect in today 's context imo . 
   rus ' , ruthenia , and russia were considered synonyms for most of history as my previous point explains those should not be considered as synonyms . 
  rus ' and ruthenia - yes , but `` russia '' when referring to kievan rus ' and realms that came from it is incorrect imo . 
   but now ukrainian and belorussian nationalists want to distinguish the terms so that they are n't seen as the same ethnic group as muscovites ( russians ) since they have a long history of being separate ethnic groups . 
  i would n't attribute it nationalists specifically . 
  seems like basic facts to me . 
  so all in all it comes down to \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f ( russia ) vs \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c ( rus ' ) and \u0440\u0443\u0441 ** \u044c ** \u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f ( land of rus ' in ruthenian ) vs \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0417\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f ( land of rus ' in russian ) = confusion . 
  it 's hard to distinguish the two and it might come off as very nitpicky but i think it 's an important distinction to make . 
  like americans being a separate thing from the english even if they came from the same source so to say . 
  the fortunate thing is that the names are easy to tell apart . 
  anyway , that 's my understanding of it . 
  it does n't help that national identities are a relatively new thing as well . 
  that 's fine but you wrote it as `` vitenis '' with the lithuanian suffix . 
  might as well write it correctly in lithuanian then , 
  poland ** is ** space . 
  first point seems a bit all over the place to me . 
  does it belong to a creepy guy that lives in it ? 
  get it ? 
  buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo . 
  i 'm just wondering what time frames are you thinking ? 
  because if you 're gon na make blanket statements you better back them up . 
  `` nothing '' includes a whole lot of things . 
  i really do n't want to go into it with you again because you have a hard-on for distancing yourself from everything `` baltic '' even though balts not scandinavians historically are the closest to you guys . 
   because the only major thing that all three have in common is the soviet occupation . 
  that is so very incorrect . 
  unless if you mean that anything before the 19th century does n't count . 
  if that 's the case then carry on . 
   maybe i can get smog alerts for beijing lol maybe . 
  i find it odd though . 
  i first activated these alerts a few years back on a nokia x2 . 
  and i have an old samsung s3 where i was able to follow the steps . 
  i would imagine an s5 would have those options too . 
  those step-by-steps seem to be from outdated android versions as well . 
  cell broadcast is indeed where you need to go . 
  then add a channel with the appropriate code ( 578 for lithuanian , 525 -- english , 605 -- russian ) . 
  name the channel `` d\u0117mesio '' ( i doubt if naming it something else is a big deal ) .
