  stop forcing people to behave how ** you ** want them to behave . 
  you 're saying it yourself : `` what about central africans , sami , finns , inuits , native americans , romani , aboriginals and basques ** who have never had a * glorious * past such as most european nations have had ** . 
  fuck them right ? '', 
  do not for a second think that i agree with you on this . 
  you 're implying that because some countries had a more `` glorious '' past it somehow makes other nations inferior . 
   have you ever though if your cultural norms and therefore the `` lithuanian '' way of life is the most optimal way of life humans could possibly live . 
  i 'll assume this is a question and not a statement . 
  no , i do not hold this belief . 
   also there is a difference between what is good and what you are comfortable with . 
  this was my point when i mentioned cannibalism , scarification and genital mutilation . 
  just goes to show that you 're just being outraged for the sake of being outraged . 
  maybe if you stopped forcing your perception of me being some kind of nazi you will notice when we are in agreement . 
  how many times do i have to say that i want a more united world the same as you ? 
  just because i 'm being rational about this and without going into radical extremes of your liking does n't mean that i 'm your enemy . 
   yes , but what does this have to do with nation states ? 
  everything . 
  like many people have pointed out already nationalism is just a modern form of tribalism . 
  the choice is pretty clear . 
  if you want a uniform and truly united world you would need to purge different cultures that are currently on earth and that will inevitably emerge again from time to time . 
  if you do nothing , however , then there will be inevitable clashes that would prevent from staying united . 
  people are n't robots . 
  it 's not a hard concept to grasp . 
  sigh ... do you do anything besides speculation ? 
   the problem with you people what is that supposed to mean ? 
  i thought everyone is the same according to you . 
  do n't be so hard on yourself . 
   the problem with you people is that you hold on to beliefs that only serves to benefit your own kind and thus yourself for being a part of that collective . 
  that does not describe me in the slightest , actually , if you must know . 
   what about central africans , sami , finns , inuits , native americans , romani , aboriginals and basques who have never had a glorious past such as most european nations have had . 
  fuck them right ? 
  lol , way to be a hypocrite . 
  so you think that `` european culture '' ( whatever that means ) is superior so african , ugric , aboriginals , etc ? 
  i never even implied such a thing . 
   you people are the reason criminal tyrrants such as putin and erdogan are able to rise up to power . 
  a divided europe benefits these bags of dicks whom you bigoted nationalists keep feeding . 
  i did n't vote for either . 
  my nationalism is purely about survival of the lithuanian language . 
  i could n't care less about scumbags who are lithuanian and i do not think that lithuanian culture is superior to any other . 
  i mean this concept must be foreign to you because it 's obvious you think that your culture is so awesome that you want to `` share '' it with anyone who is n't `` european '' be erasing any kind of divergence from the `` norm '' . 
   japan was once divided , so was german and the gallic tribes . 
  what makes it impossible for a unification to happen in a large scale . 
  human psychology or whatever you want to call it . 
  human social psychology ? 
  evolutionary darwinism , pehaps ? 
  it 's a pretty common concept by now that people can not hold meaningful relationships with more than 150 people or so ( i do not remember the exact number ) . 
  it is so blatantly obvious that western europe does n't really care about anything that happens east past germany if it does n't affect them directly that asking for empathy for the whole world is beyond utopian . 
  now before you speculate once more and resort to ad hominems let me just say that i would also like a more united world . 
  but i 'm also a realist and i 've grown out of utopian ideals by now . 
  if you want to be angry at me for not participating in your fantasies then so be it , but avoid being a hypocrite while you 're at it . 
  i do n't necessarily disagree that the world is becoming more globalised and uniform , however , you are speculating way too much to get your point across . 
  you are wrapping the world up into a singular perspective of a specific middle class ( i assume ) swede and your viewpoint of a globalized world seems to be concerning only the western world . 
  firstly , we do n't all dress alike . 
  even in europe . 
  i do n't know how common kilts are in scotland for daily use but just that particular article of clothing shows that it is culturally ok for men to basically wear skirts . 
  i wo n't even get into scarification or genital mutilation practices of some peoples . 
  and what do you even mean by dressing alike ? 
  wearing shoes , pants and shirts/jackets ? 
  that is so besides the point . 
  there are only so many types of clothing one can wear to look stylish , be comfortable and useful for protecting from the environment . 
  it 's like reinventing the bicycle . 
  there are a lot of things and concepts that a society would not fall apart without . 
  let 's take the practice of cannibalism in new guinea for example . 
  i do n't think a lot of people in europe could find common ground with cannibals . 
  and on the other hand societies would not fall apart without the internet or being an information society either . 
  i 'll sum up :  look around you , we all dress alike . 
  no , we do n't . 
   we all have the same amount of diversity within nations . 
  no , we do n't . 
   for example a japanese person might have more in common with a swede or german person , more so than an another japanese person . 
  highly , speculative . 
  i could easily argue that swedes have more in common with norwegians than japanese people . 
   since internet and the information society started to emerge , there is absolutely no need for nationslism in order for a society to work . 
  i 'll repeat myself here . 
  there is also no need to the internet or `` an information society '' for a society to work . 
  there are many highly destructive and highly altruistic practices that societies would not crumble without . 
   we are all moving towards a more globalised world , which will head towards a world with no nation states . 
  no , we are not . 
  just look at north korea or the recent isolationist actions of russia . 
   our grandchildren ( if we have any ) will look down upon us and think how stupid and immature we were in the early 21st century . 
  super speculation double whammy jackpot . 
  look , i get it . 
  i do n't like when people talk shit and talking down to other people just because their ancestors did something 500 years ago like they had something to do with it . 
  and i will speculate here as well , but without cultural pride the world would look a lot bleaker imo . 
  nevermind that humans tend to gravitate towards groups anyway . 
  there 's so much empathy one can feel for someone who you do n't even share a timeline with . 
  i 'm all for global cooperation and working for humanity 's sake but erasing cultural differences ( and by extension language , because there are nations whose language is their fundamental attribute ) would not only not work but would not last . 
  human groups would diverge sooner or later just by being in different environments . 
   nation states are becoming outdated , whether tou like it or not .

  and yet again you completely ignore every question i pose to you . 
  stick to your original point  go ahead , build those strawmen . 
   yeah , also some guy in the forest probably saw a helicopter . 
  this is your original point . 
  if you want to stick to a point how about you stick to your original one . 
  i see what you 're trying to do here . 
  stop moving the goal post . 
  oh , and guess what ? 
  if the helicopters were so close to the border that they ** might ** have violated it or not then please tell me what was the reason for that other than intimidation ? 
  russian helicopters have no business being so close to lithuanian airspace . 
  if they can not turn around before the question even arises it 's a clear provocation .
