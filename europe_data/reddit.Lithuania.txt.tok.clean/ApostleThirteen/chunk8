  of course , if the uk left the eu , scotland could easily opt for independence and join the eu , without any veto from london . 
  kaliningrad was ceded to the ussr at potsdam , but it certainly was n't supposed to be outright annexed . 
  the potsdam conference ended with truman and churchill agreeing that kaliningrad 's ultimate disposistion would be sorted out in the following formal peace treaty which never happened . 
  the legitimacy of russian rule over kaliningrad is tenuous , at best , considering the present , as well as history . 
  you mean like the ussr did in the kaliningrad region in 1947 , in violation of the 1907 hague convention ? 
  then , yes , absolutely . 
  the us seems to follow international law pertaining to territorial integrity , the treaties that they have ratified , and on topics of global trade . 
  but seriously , are ` tards like yourself trying to say that if some group does a bad thing , then it 's okay for others the world over to do evil without repercussions ? 
  'cause i ai n't buying that shit . 
  the eu has to keep talking to russia . 
  they have to know what 's going on , and when they 'll really need to help ... could you imagine russia collapsing or going into a civil war ? 
  it would make the whole syrian thing an `` unproblem '' . 
  they did say `` good music radio stations '' ... 
  look !, 
  you can * still * buy them in stores here in lithuania !, 
  they call them on this webpage that links to a physical store `` paprastosios specialiosios lempos '' , or `` ordinary special lamps '' . 
  this is a store that sells tools , gardening supplies , laundry/dishwashing stuff , food , beer , sodas , and electronic goods , etc. . . 
  it 's absolutely legal . 
  that bright 6000k color helps your body with the whole `` seasonal affected disorder '' syndrome , too . 
  yes , `` the wrath '' includes the * possibility * of a nato response of armed force , but most certainly and definitely promises a response of `` such action as it deems necessary '' ... whatever that will be . 
  what 'd they just say today in washington ? 
  kiev serves next ? 
  so this recent `` lull '' from the eastern side has nothing to do with the increasing numbers of anti-armor weapons and grenade launchers entering the west ( from bugaria , etc ) and `` finding places '' and `` appearing '' in the eastern half of the country ? 
  i think there 's more to why the separatists are merely `` holding ground '' as a border , and following minsk when they were n't before , and the recent unhappiness in the eastern population has much to do with it , also . 
  because all of the lithuanian ones go west to make money while their life force is sucked out of them ... 
  ca n't wait to read what everyday russians think about what they have been , and will be eating in the near future . 
  ca n't wait to see them bulldozing , burning , and burying the `` fake cheese '' . 
  ca n't wait to see what turns up when they test the sausages and processed meats on the market . 
  not even implying to split up a country , but simply mentioning that in their own right , they are already separate countries , and each could choose to seek eu status . 
  much as not every eu passport is equal , perhaps such it could become for members of the uk . 
  and the north dakota argument is weak , and false ... the un already has treaties on territorial integrity which would label canada and aggressor if they signaled that they would accept a us state ... besides the fact that the us supreme court has ruled unilateral secession as unconstitutional . 
  and let 's just say that a little more than half the country would take a dim view , and that before any `` brexit '' happens ... after that and we 'll have to check the bookmakers . 
  they already have a drip coffee chain in europe for americans . 
  it 's called mcdonald 's . 
  in the us , boiled or even turkish brew is called `` cowboy coffee '' because it 's how they make crap coffee on a campfire . 
  it will just be a `` squeeze '' on the `` kingdom '' ... other countries , like northern ireland , scotland , wales , and even england will always be welcome to join the eu ... 
  it 's not like the uk will be able to veto their accession . 
  actually kind of funny when you think about it . 
  them too !, 
  neither do muricans , although mexicans do !, 
  from 2000 to 2010 , there were 7.1 million mexican citizens born in the us , while only 4.2 million migrated to the us . 
  ( that 's right , according to mexican law , as well as family tradition , children born in the us are still `` mexicans '' , and mexican does not denote a race , but a political designation ) http://www.pewhispanic.org/files/reports/144.pdf, 
  after taxes are deducted from their paycheck , they end up with somewhere between 70 and 75 % of their salary/wages ... pretty much the same as in lt , only they do n't pay an outrageous pvm or vat on every purchase from clothes to food to gasoline ... 
  - with european clones !, 
  conscription is so new to lithuania that it was discontinued in 2008 ... new in terms of teen kids becoming aware that they may have to serve , possibly . 
  oh great ... now i know why lithuania needs those german howitzers ... 
  russian nuclear subs seem to very dependable . . to have nuclear reactor `` accidents '' . 
  no mention of our colony of cyprus ? 
  it 's actually quite funny to hear an austrian claim '' ... europe does have a serious defense force and plenty of nukes ... '' actually , nato has `` plenty of nukes '' ... 
  the eu is not a military alliance , and neutral countries get to have , and eat , their neutral cake . 
  this was a * memorandum * not a treaty . 
  had a treaty been signed and ratified by the us , then some sort of real response would have been required under us law . 
  without a treaty , and just the memorandum , russia knew exactly what it was doing . 
  yet their polish jokes are always brilliantly `` spot on '' ... 
  `` evil '' is too strong , and it is like giving the human traits to , well , you know the rest ... 
  considering that finland was part of russia as long as we were , until around 1917 , we were on the same step , but when you guys just gave them karelia , the best part of finland , for nothing , well , who would n't want to be part of the ussr ? 
  i do n't know if it 's surprising or just expected for cyprus to have such a low seizure rate , considering that when you visit the island , you an easily see that the number of bongs in tourist shops outnumber the number of actual cypriots you 'll meet on your vacation there . 
  well , thank you for your languages ' quaint interpretation of `` bell pepper '' ... 
  sadly , there were no `` bell peppers '' or `` chile peppers '' until they were brought , by the spanish , descendants of italians , no less , to the old world . 
  that is , they never were even seen in your dark , little armpit of europe and civilization until after `` christopher columbus '' , a probable lithuanian ( http://www.lrt.lt/en/news_in_english/29/33829/christopher_columbus_a_grandson_of_a_lithuanian_grand_duke_ ) , returned from the new world with them . 
  thank you , and keep reaching for whatever it is you 're reaching for , however far down you have to until you can grab it !, 
  the piper is for black pepper , not the new world genus capsicum . 
  let my weak attempt at microaggressions stand . 
  okay , so `` paprika '' hungarian word , from uralic root ... 
  i 'm sure your language is nice and some good words too . 
  and those `` symbols '' ... as much hindu as american aboriginal as european ... 
  i 'm sure your culture has some nice symbols , too . 
  nah , capsicum is n't ridiculous , it separates the bell and chile peppers from black pepper ... 
  in `` resistance and rebellion '' cambridge university press , roger d. petersen writes that `` the soviets admit roughly 20,000 casualties in lithuania ... '' also , in `` the partisan movement in postwar lithuania '' lithuanian quarterly journal of arts and sciences volume 15 , no. 1 - spring 1969 v.stanley vardys relates `` the director of the lithuanian communist party 's history institute at vilnius told an american journalist in 1961 that during the partisan war `` about 20,000 bandits [ partisans ] were killed and about an equal number of our own people . '', 
  so , at the very least , we can say with great confidence that more than 20,000 soviets were killed . 
  i wonder why pocius did n't mention any of that ? 
  or that spies who infiltrated partisan `` forest brother '' groups acted as `` agents provocatures '' by killing and advocating the killing of civilians . 
  if you 'd like to go by what soviets historically * admitted * as opposed to what was found out to be true , you 're welcome to , but let 's look at one important fact concerning soviet reporting of war dead : at beginning of 1984 , the soviet press has reported six dead and wounded soldiers , when in all now-known reality , the 40th army had well over 6,000 kia . 
  but if the casualties on the soviet side had ever been made public , it certainly would have . 
  did you know that there was open guerrilla warfare in lithuania after world war two until the death of stalin ? 
  did you know that in this time 22000 partisans , as well as 70000 of the red army were killed then , in what was the longest guerrilla war in europe ? 
  i do n't think that russia would have it that easy anywhere in the baltics today ... even the russians who live there do n't want anything to do with putin . 
  saudi arabia knows their time is almost up . 
  the `` 28 pages '' made it clear to the us what the sauds are doing , and while they work as convenient pawns against russia , they also fund isis ... 
  which is why washington lets iran do what it will . 
  erdogan 's candle is burning down fast . 
  he knows it , and that 's why he 's trying to play both sides hard . 
  stalin did n't have `` conquests '' in the baltics . 
  he had ceded lithuania to the german sphere of influence under molotov-ribbentrop before he forced the baltics to sign treaties of mutual assistance . 
  actually , hitler did n't stab russia in the back , it was the other way around ... 
  according to the molotov-ribbentrop protocol , lithuania was to stay under the german `` sphere of influence '' . 
  the ussr later forced the baltics to sign treaties of `` mutual assistance '' . 
  operation barbarossa was meant to right the soviet treachery , and then some ... 
  if the soviets had kept their word ... as if there is a true russian word for `` honor '' that is spoken without hearing laughter . 
  it does n't matter what trump specifies , what matters is the treaty as written and ratified in the us ... and that is what makes it as `` the law of the land '' under artcle six of the us constitution . 
  mr trump continues to be the sad poster boy of terminal cranially-impacted rectum . 
  there s no cure for having your head up your ass . 
  trump once again does n't know what his stupid mouth is saying . 
  nato is an international treaty , ratified by the us congress . 
  by that virtue , it falls under article six of the us constitution , which makes it as `` law of the land '' superseding all laws before it . 
  if he took the presidential oath , and failed to uphold such a treaty , criminal charges , as well as impeachment would occur instantly . 
  you mean like most of ireland , india , or anyplace else the sun has set on for you guys ? 
  one million ? 
  in a country of three hundred million ? 
  sometime between much later and never , i guess ... after all , that 's already happened a few times over in the last century .
