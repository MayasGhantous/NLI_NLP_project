  the former president of my country was a refugee to the west in 1945 . 
  so yeah . 
   the first one is definitely false [ do n't lie , you did n't even check . 
  ] ( http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter/w5_show?p_r=4445&amp;p_d=113114&amp;p_k=1 ) the seimas of the republic of lithuania agreed to compensate the jewish community in lithuania all the way back in 2011 . 
   and this is a contemporary issue as well with lithuania refusing to acknowledge it 's role in the crimes and to continue to portray many war criminals as heroes as many of them also fought against the soviet union false . 
  fucking false . 
  `` the legitimacy of the provisional government created by laf and the declaration of independence of lithuania on june 23rd , 1941 are not accepted by modern lithuanian historiography . 
  while their goal of restoring lithuanian independence is given respect , it is important to remember and denounce the pro-nazi and anti-semitic ideology of the organization '' . 
  do n't shit on a nation you 've never seen in your entire life without doing research first . 
  all of eastern europe is celebrating next year :p, 
  people are surprised at poland . 
  we only had one bad year , we 're not too far behind , look at us !, 
  baltic tiger brothers ftw !, 
  maybe they 'll extend eu money to give some after 2020 !, 
   no `` wilno nasz '' for lithuania 0/10 not enough butthurt, 
  we need a some sort of lithuanian equivalent too, 
  the joke --  your head, 
  this is the original pie language , come at us ( not really though ), 
  you 're dead to me, 
  imagine if we were on the same economic ranking as finland or ireland today, 
   `` lithvian ''  daring to compare our holy oldest language in europe to latvian russo-germanic unintelligible squabbles you just made an enemy for life, 
  i am lithuanian and i approve of this message, 
  lithuania is more free than : france usa poland latvia italy oh yeah . 
  you mean nord stream ? 
  yeah , that was pretty shit . 
  here in lithuania many people would prefer a strongman and are nationalist , but ( as an example ) `` kremlin spy '' is used as a swear word towards politicians you do n't like , so this equation does n't really work . 
  because germans = nazis to some people i suppose, 
  tell me about it, 
  same in lithuanian , `` bi\u010das '' , also often used as a translation of `` dude '', 
  danelaw 2 : electric boogaloo, 
  we do , we really do, 
  hehe , over here we have a president who 's sometimes more important than the prime minister himself . 
  although that mostly stems from her personality rather than her powers . 
  if our country was a girl , it 'd be like a tsundere in the cuteness tier . 
  sorry for the anime jargon, 
  i think many of the people who see the ussr positively ( on the internet , i mean ) , are from the west . 
  they probably have no idea shit like this even happened . 
  lithuania had an 11 % growth rate in 2007, 
  voted , if you want to settle in a laissez faire paradise to feel like home , we 're waiting for ya . 
  how about swedish girls ? 
  [ you mean like this ? 
  ] ( http://fishki.lt/uploads/posts/2010-01/1262651371_lietuva-afrika.jpg ) we do poke fun at our country 's african-ness sometimes . 
  usually the flag colors . 
   \u0160iauliai - people from \u0160iauliai are usually depicted like the stereotypical person from eastern europe , wearing tracksuits and armed with baseball bats . 
  there 's even an anecdote about it :  * \u0160iauliai is a city very dedicated to sports . 
  last year , 500 baseball bats and 3 baseballs were bought there !, 
  *  mel gibson famously said in his novel : `` sharp-toothed lithuanians armed with baseball bats are crawling across the beach into your house . 
  what should we do with them ? 
  we have to fight back . '', 
  who could 've known that he was writing about life in \u0160iauliai all along ? 
  there 's a long post above, 
  or lithuanian who 's downed one beer too many and is trying way too hard to speak normal, 
  i have no idea why we have it either . 
  there 's only one road to it , it 's hard for police or border guards to look over , so cigarettes smugglers from belarus use it to hide their stocks after entering the country . 
  considering that we view scandinavia as an example of what we want to become over here , i do n't think `` did n't even try '' fits, 
   she even says her self vilnius is full of gays , jews and poles !, 
  well she got 2 out of 3 right kaunas and vilnius have a fierce rivalry . 
  not glasgow-edinburgh tier , but not far . 
  though , you 're lucky she is n't from \u0160iauliai or panev\u0117\u017eys or something . 
  there is not enough bolding in the world to stop lithuanian nationalism, 
  well you ca n't control a city without also having some control over the area around it , after all . 
  and besides , almost all the cities in lithuania were majorly jewish , but jews were still a minority . 
  none of them were accurate because all of them pushed their own agenda . 
  polish censuses overblown polish population , russian censuses overblown russian and belarusian population and lithuanian censuses overblown lithuanian population . 
  if we wanted to get the most accurate , the biggest part of population were tutejszy and neither one of the three . 
  considering that the 1916 german census says that [ 58 % of inhabitants of lithuania were polish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_the_vilnius_region#1916_german_census ) , i 'm liable to not believe it . 
  the 1897 russian census [ says that the area around vilnius was mostly belarusian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_the_vilnius_region#russian_census_of_1897 ) . 
  but none of the censuses at the time are accurate , anyway . 
  could 've said grand duchy and pedants like me would n't attack you . 
  ( not that interwar lithuania ever wanted to control everything gdl held , but who cares ), 
  back then most people were n't sure that the 1253 kingdom even existed, 
  that was actually just a bluff to make germans recognize lithuanian independence , the council of lithuania never wanted to make lithuania into a kingdom . 
  there was a war for podolia between poland and lithuania in the 1350s , i think . 
  poland won . 
  actually there were more belarusians there than either poles or lithuanians , but you do n't see belarus bitch about it . 
  especially since they actually have historical ( however meager ) basis for wanting vilnius, 
  i do n't even care tbh, 
  [ context ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_central_lithuania ) edit : and [ one way to unite lithuanians ] ( https://scontent.fhen1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/15421002_578062565715834_8494527323315635580_n.jpg?efg=eyjpijoiyij9&amp;oh=32ebe662de4626dd70a44b91c886dc5e&amp;oe=58e68c4a ), 
  yours may be taller than ours , but [ auk\u0161tojas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/auk%c5%a1tojas_hill ) literally means `` tall hill '' also a name of a baltic deity , but it 's literally tall !, 
  almost 3 times bigger than ours . 
  lucky you . 
  same in lithuania - upon declaring independence in 1990 , we actually changed to +1 time to be closer to the rest of europe . 
  however , it cause numerous problems for the people , and we eventually had a referendum on a timezone change that the +2 camp won . 
  * coughs * excuse me ? 
  we need to go on the offensive this time brother . 
  who needs a navy when you have vytautas mineral water, 
  yass, 
  the period of the commonwealth saw the population of lithuania fall by 40-50 % in the deluge , with similarly massive losses 50 years later during the great northern war . 
  it also saw the eradication of the lithuanian state through the partitions , and lithuanian language began nearing extinction because of polonization . 
  those were n't the best of times , you have to accept that . 
  yes , because snie\u010dkus actually had a reasonable brain , even if he was a communist puppet . 
  i mean , i guess you can extend it to 1990 , but then the old people on reddit would bitch, 
  pretty much all the time from 1430-1945, 
  mate , you can cry all you want , but you 'll never reach the level of our suffering . 
  shh . 
  do n't cry because it happened , smile because it 's over . 
  good point . 
  she does n't have that black belt in karate for nothing . 
  if eu had to challenge putin to a 1v1 brawl , i 'd send her . 
  lithuania 's president has no husband,
