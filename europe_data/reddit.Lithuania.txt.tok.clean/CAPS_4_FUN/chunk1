german population, 
  you have so much god damn space though . 
  i do n't think housing market is the problem . 
  ** labor market ** is the problem . 
  too many jobs concentrated in too few places . 
  if there were jobs up north , i 'm sure housing would n't be an issue . 
  judging by their demographics , they wo n't even exist in a 100 years anyways ... might as well just sell that land to russia . 
   nationalism is the feeling of pride for your village , province , country with superiority feelings . 
  no it is n't . 
  stop redefining things to something ridiculous . 
  you people do that all the time . 
  you think changing the language of something will change the concepts behind it . 
  nationalism is basically a form of culture where people see themselves in relation to the group rather than in relation to individual self-interests . 
  that 's it . 
  your fertility rate stands at 1.6 and you 're surrounded by two continents with rapidly growing populations . 
  oh , and by the way , they 're all highly religious and getting even more religious . 
  nationalism is exactly what you need . 
  but good luck with your `` rationality '' ... you 'll `` rationalize '' your way straight out of existence . 
   you forgot the '' / s '' you 're living in a bubble ... a tiny tiny bubble . 
   i am sure now you have n't got proper education . 
  please go to your nearest library and lend a book about the roman empire , from it 's beginnings to it 's end . 
  be amazed by what is happening during ( and after ) these times . 
  northern italy was n't germanic ?!? 
  invaders of rome were n't germanic ?!? 
  these are basic facts . 
  what are you trying to say here . 
   if he would be born and raised in china and be part of chinese culture , why would he not be chinese ? 
  just because of the colour of his skin ? 
  you have a very racialy view of the world , that almost sounds racist to me : / you know damn well no one in china would consider him chinese ... oh , and chinese people have a `` white '' skin color anyways . 
  stop obsessing about skin color . 
  why not hair color ? 
  not every blond person on this planet is swedish , but most swedes are blond . 
  holy this what a complicated concept !!, 
  and that 's my god damn point . 
  everyone on this planet has this `` racial view '' of the world . 
  it 's only germans , french , english , and swedish ( < 5 % of the planet 's population ) that have gone completely nuts . 
  it 's your view that 's in the minority here . 
   there is a difference between being dutch ( having a dutch passport ) and being part of dutch culture . 
  there are people in the netherlands who are born and raised here and have the dutch nationality , but are outside of dutch culture and seen as second rate citizens ( turks , mocrrocans , etc ) . 
  what the hell is `` dutch culture '' ?? 
  whatever happens to define `` culture '' for you , your parents probably had a different culture in their times . 
  and their grandparents too . 
  what holds it all together ? 
  it ca n't be `` values '' or `` democracy '' ... that shit is less than 100 years old . 
  dutch/germanic people are thousands of years old . 
  under your definition of `` culture '' , your grandparents would n't be part of this `` dutch culture '' and thus would n't be considered dutch since dutch culture = dutch . 
  you 're not making any sense which is why i think you 're trolling me . 
   edit : for a good ( but simplified ) view on the germanic migrations : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migration_period but that map just proves my point ... germanic people were much more widespread in the past . 
  visigoths , vandals , and those north of rome were purely germanic . 
  hell , hitler even tried taking northern portion of italy because it was so german . 
  this is why your nonsense about `` roman migrations '' everywhere is so stupid . 
  it 's three times now where you have failed to show me this proof of netherlands being `` a land of immigrants '' where germanics , non-germanics , and non-europeans in general have come and go around this geography for thousands of years . 
  go back 2000 years , and you 'll find germanic people that are indistinguishable from dutch people today living in that region . 
  it 's the same nonsense i get when i argue with english people who try justifying their extinction by talking about `` roman invasions '' and vikings or whatever , when the facts show something totally different : http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0719_050719_britishgene_2.html, 
   oh no , you are one of those `` so much % of this or that harritage '' nutters o_o that explains your comments here . 
  there is a double standard here which i 'm pointing out . 
  a person of some european ancestry calling himself chinese would be laughed out no matter how flawlessly he speaks the language . 
   please take a look at this page : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_peoples#origins sighs ... it 's already late here and i really do n't want to bring up all these ethnographic maps showing that `` netherlanders of 1200 bc '' are essentially the same in their `` contents '' as they are now . 
  you 're wrong here unless your notion of `` germanic '' is limited to what constitutes ethnic german today . 
  `` germans '' were much much more widespread in the past . 
   please take a look at this page : r/shitamericanssay it is defenately not a nice page , but it is full of examples with people like you who have very akward ideas about immigrants and people from other countries . 
  i 'm not even an american though ... 
   no idea what you are trying to imply here ??? 
  both cherokee/sioux/navajo / whatever share the same identical passport as all those irish/anglo immigrants who have settled/immigrated into america in the 1800s . 
  yet you would make a distinction between an irish-american person and a native-american cherokee person would n't you ? 
  you would . 
  ethnicity and nationality are two different things . 
  no bureaucrat on earth can turn an irish person into an ethnic cherokee . 
  that is the difference here . 
   if you would read careful enough , you would see that only the first farmers and the germanic tribes were settlers , all the rest were immigrants . 
  the people the netherlands needs right now are again immigrants . 
  nobody has said anything about settlers . 
  who do you defined as `` the first '' ? 
  as i said : peoples of netherlands ( or whatever that region was called 5000 years ago ) were predominantly germanic in their racial character . 
  that is a fact . 
  do you dispute that ? 
  people who arrived here when it was pretty much empty were not `` immigrants '' . 
  what exactly did they `` immigrate '' into ?? 
  wilderness is not a country . 
   the people the netherlands needs right now are again immigrants . 
  nobody has said anything about settlers . 
  dutch people do n't need more alien foreigners squeezing them out of their own homeland . 
   you make no sence anymore . 
  netherlands is not a `` land of immigrants '' . 
  there is no such thing . 
  that 's an american invention ( false too btw ) . 
  i really hate seeing europeans eating up american propaganda whatever it happens to be . 
  that 's what i have tried to say there . 
   if you have a dutch passport , you are dutch . 
  after a few generations , most immigrants will be part of dutch society . 
  if you have an american passport , you are cherokee . 
  after a few generations , most irish immigrants will be part of cherokee society ... am i doing this right ? 
   the netherlands was always a land of immigrants , they came in waves : there is a huge difference between immigrants and settlers . 
  japan is a product of siberian and east asian ** settlers ** , not immigrants . 
  yet you would n't say japan is a `` land of immigrants '' would you ? 
  using your logic , every single country on this earth is a `` land of immigrants '' , but somehow this shit only applies to few rich western countries ... oh , and by the way , all those bullshit `` immigrant waves '' you listed were : 1 ) over exaggerated in numbers , and 2 ) over exaggerated in their `` exoticness '' . 
  all those groups were almost exclusively from germanic sources either way . 
  eight kinds of honey is still honey . 
  dutch has been exclusively germanic in their racial character since day 1 . 
  this `` land of immigrants '' bullshit started in the 1900s .
