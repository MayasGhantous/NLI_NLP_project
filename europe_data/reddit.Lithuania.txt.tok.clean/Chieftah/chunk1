interesting fact : there 's a town near that gambian colony island which has a bar/inn named `` labas '' , the lithuanian `` hi '' . 
  we love you too !, 
  please excuse me while i hide in the corner and cry . 
  rekt . 
  [ check your facts before posting , lithuania was n't the poorest baltic state by gdp per capita in 2011 .

  corrections : - other baltic states also had the decline , latvian decline is even worse , but somehow that does n't make their ppp any more bigger . 
  - also same as previous . 
  - the salary is one of the lowest in * european union * - * 300 euro * - last point in utter nonsense , sorry . 
  [ oh , and poland 's gdp ppp per capita never was 21,600 . 
  in 2011 it was $ 19,843 . 
  and lithuania 's in 2011 was $ 20,195 .

  who 's sucking dicks now ? 
  only after you get beaten first !, 
  thanks , latgale !, 
  wait until i post ppp . 
  we 'll see who laughs then , you peasants . 
  well i got ta say lidl did surprise me . 
  this time we get to choose a king , ` aight ? 
  fair point . 
  sail here and take it from us !, 
  ... and thus begins the story of the pirates of the kurlandian !, 
  we got a lithuanian bar in that gambian island , sadly no income yet :(, 
  how about the grand duchy of lithuania ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ? 
  latvia no questions asked . 
  count me in !, 
  seriously , it seems like an interesting idea and i 'd really like to see it happen . 
  [ lithuania 's mfa talked about it today . 
  ] ( http://en.delfi.lt/nordic-baltic/minister-of-foreign-affairs-sees-abduction-in-estonia-as-provocation.d?id=65764892 ), 
  do n't forget puns and jokes about terrible road condition too . 
  can someone explain this ? 
  [ la braban\u00e7onne of belgium ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9u_ituu2q8 ) is just incredible . 
  they could 've at least wrote the title so it 's not made entirely of wacky phrases and i can understand what they want to say ... 
  a stork . 
  well ... fuck . 
  he probably could n't stand the greatness of our conquests and tribal prosperity !, 
  the minority is smaller but there are lots of them as tourists because it 's cheap and nearby . 
  but let 's not forget that there are many belorussians in vilnius who sometimes might speak russian or just sound similar . 
  technically part of you is also our tribe . 
  soon the world shall kneel before our tribal empire !, 
  lithuanian and baltic ( well about 1/3 american but that 's a different matter ) . 
  anyone can go to any city in the world and find the worst place imaginable and talk as if it is * the * city, 
  so what , am i supposed to break my leg to get to submit this ? 
  then do it !, 
  also promo music . 
  baltic states are rapidly changing . 
  what could be applied 10 years ago can not be applied today . 
  of course there are places which might be underdeveloped or poorer than what the current state of the baltics are , but all of that might change in a few years  overall , i think it 's a great and unique place to live in , 
  i read this in a posh accent . 
  makes more sense then :|, 
  rekt . 
  this is so similar , wow !, 
  so your saying that putin is saruman ? 
  checks out with my theory of russia being mordor !, 
  oops , forgot to load the humanitarian cargo . 
  listen , how about this ? 
  i go back to our glorious ~ ~ leader putin ~ ~ humanitarian cargo camp and load them full and you let us go without second check , alright ? 
  no need to check the same truck twice , yes ? 
  please wait whike shit is preparing to go down ... respraying military vehicles ... 
  spreading propoganda ... 
  preparing the convoy ... 
  creating detours ... 
  entering enemy territory ... loading complete !, 
  at least someone from the baltics does n't have a negative view towards their countries . 
  edit : that makes two of us , actually .

  so suggestions please ? 
  what album thing i should do next ? 
  changed , 
  it seems like there is nothing else to change . 
  peace has been restored !, 
  thanks for the suggestions as well !, 
  changed it to a dacia , so you know . 
  ** alright , guys , calm down , i edited the album as some of you suggested ** - bulgaria changed - romania changed - uk changed - austria changed, 
  i changed the bulgarian one already , do you want me to change the seat to something else ? 
  sidebar  your name  edit, 
  ok now i 'm confused which is true which is false . 
  these are not the most common ones , these are just police cars that are used everyday by the police forces . 
  yup , i 'd better change that !, 
  because of the highway and the zunds river ( is that the right name ? ), 
  this is not what most people would wish , but : - i 'd just move lithuania somewhere near italy or spain , away from russians and cold climate . 
  what made you think so ? 
  i guess the good thing about our highrises is that we actually decided on a single district where we could build them . 
  everything is built there and we have a nice `` downtown '' area without cluttering the rest of the town with useless skyscrapers . 
  i personally love the highrises in vilnius , because if not for them , [ this is what would be creeping when looking from the old town ] ( http://www.truelithuania.com/nuotraukos/vilniussnipiskes.jpg ) - a huge wooden house district dating back to 19th century , most of the homes are run-down , dirty , the roads are unpaved , because the municipality decided that it is a cultural heritage district and nobody builds anything there . 
  but because our another mayor was a little bit more cold-minded , he suggested companies to buy abandoned yards ( which are still bought today ) and build their highrises there . 
  i think riga has a lovely old town panorama from the river and i really like the difference between left and right banks/old and new , but let 's be honest , [ this place is n't the best place to build skyscrapers ] ( https://www.google.lt/maps/place/ryga,+latvija/@56.9498996,24.0859519,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x46eecfb0e5073ded:0x400cfcd68f2fe30 ), 
  damn right . 
  [ vilnius ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gvdy4nq.jpg ) nice old wooden architectural heritage across the street . 
  taken on one beautiful morning a couple of days ago . 
  holy shit , i have never seen the first picture angle ? 
  where it 's taken from ? 
  and oh , yeah , i forgot about the second pic , i posted that here a few months ago , looks like la :3, 
  that is the most atrocious-looking angle for vilnius i 've ever seen . 
  a quick google search gave me this : http://www.party-weekends.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/vilnius6.jpg other than that , looks fabulous , highrises give me a boner as well . 
  do n't ya worry , my friend - i can handle this , just hold my beer for a sec , will ya ?
