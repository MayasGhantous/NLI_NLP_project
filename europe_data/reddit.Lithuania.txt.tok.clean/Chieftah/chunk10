  i 've seen quite a few teslas in vilnius lately . 
  dunno where they get the juice from , but heyyyy , nice . 
  they 're banned , but the rest is still here ( like empty shield plaques with nothing on them ) , like this : https://www.google.lt/maps/@54.689706,25.26436,3a,23.3y,208.82h,93.94t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sg-xnyymr6phxv-u2v1f5za!2e0 does n't bother me at all , it even looks classy some times . 
  as long as it does n't have the banned symbols or those retarded grain tufts . 
  what about hyuma ? 
  start of a new series ? 
  lithuanian . 
  yup . 
  i can safely say i have developed an ability to understand him throughout the years of watching tv channels . 
  [ lithuanian dubbing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syn5_i-2evs&amp;ab_channel=apostolossyropoulos ) . 
  combo audio tracks !, 
  since no one else answered it correctly , it 's albania . 
  [ gediminas was a grand duke of lithuania .

  why are you above us ? 
  the elder scrolls series . 
  any game , every game . 
  if that 's the only other language they know , why not ? 
  i bought a special viewing glass from senukai for a euro , watched the eclipse without even taking the glass out of the packaging , am planning to return the glass back to the store and retrieving my money . 
  combo . 
  such a rare pic !, 
  i know it 's hard to get a clear-sky photograph of mordor without mt. 
  doom ash clouds all over the place !, 
  it 'd be great to have the baltic assembly do something more , this sounds like a cool name with a cool potential . 
  pretty neat . 
  let 's be logical and trust the scientists . 
  it 's a pole shift . 
  who does n't love surprises , amirite ? 
  one of them is tomaszewski , so no big deal . 
  he 's always like that . 
  translation : the russian flag atop kremlin is no more . 
  what could it mean ? 
  there are a lot of trucks around . 
  ... but its ayyliens !, 
  praise our galactic overlords !, 
  to be really honest , both sound great because i do n't know what neither of them means . 
  must have skipped the first minute when searching . 
  thanks , 
  they 're lying !, 
  #americaworks #underwood 2016 #tupacaliveinserbia, 
  dunno about eastern europe , but baltics ? 
  in your dreams !, 
  never ever have i heard even the faintest resemblance to what 's been said in that show . 
  this is ridiculous fantasy and should not be taken seriously at all costs . 
  what in the fucking hell is this ... edit : maybe , by any chance , you know when exactly in that episode this thing happens ? 
  shameful display !, 
  samogitians , charge !, 
  we 'll see how well you 'll fare when you face our invincible army of pagan sorcerers on aurochs . 
  launch the snakes !, 
  careful , russia built an aircraft carrier and can now drop missionaries to other civilizations by air . 
  wait , hold on a sec !, 
  how come the ex-nazi germany has 47 % ? 
  what about the ex-ottoman bulgaria ? 
  really ? 
  the ex-roman italy has 42 % ? 
  my mind 's saying latvia , but my body 's lithuania . 
  found the traitor !, 
  \\* sigh \\* ... to the headsman 's block !, 
  was it this [ one ? 
  it 's been confirmed on news that conscripts wo n't go for training in other countries . 
  cut the rest of the curonian spit for us , will ya ? 
  for the love of perk\u016bnas , just summon the fucking snakes and be done with this . 
  we all love each other < 3, 
  as far as i 'm aware , latvia does n't have direct presidential elections like we do . 
  the parliament elects the president . 
  i 've been thinking about the same idea for a while now , but i 'm too lazy to do anything . 
  sorting traffic cones by age is so german i ca n't believe . 
  this is the best series in a while , keep them up , we need more countries !, 
  you make me want to try and go to prisma again . 
  how 's prisma ? 
  is it the best retail chain in finland ? 
  we have a ton of prismas here but i 've only been once and it seemed like they have less product variety , and it was a hypermarket . 
  ** you forgot lithuania you bastard !!,

   pole , reigned by :  an elected person checkmate america . 
  edit : lithuania was part of the commonwealth back then so what is polish is also lithuanian muahaha !, 
  or it would be if it were n't posted on april fools . 
  baltic megalomania explosion incoming !, 
  any fans of vilnius trolley line 1 and line 7 ? 
  this is so accurate . 
  i had the ` pleasure ' of travelling to helsinki by ferry a few years ago . 
  literally anything can and will happen there !, 
  the infernal noah 's ark of gambling, 
  our legendary historical expansion and medieval multiculturalism and tolerance . 
  our uniting sport - basketball . 
  our growing economy and quality of life . 
  our freedom that we were n't given , but fought for . 
  that enough is something to be truly proud of my country . 
  but i also feel like a european and i believe that we are culturally and socially close enough to identify as * europeans * as well as our own nationalities . 
  yeah , having a ton of lakes and lots of urban forests is a huge bonus any time of year . 
  during cold winters , the forests are very relaxing and shelter you from wind . 
  lakes provide an awesome extreme ice fishing experience . 
  in summer , forest-parks offer a ton of shade and a quiet , fresh place to chill . 
  and lakes ... lakes are a godsend during july/august draught season ( i really dread calling it like that , but if it returns for the third consecutive year , i will really start to think that we 're becoming slightly more subtropical . 
  if it 's going to be week-long 38 \u00b0 c like it was in 2015/2014 , i am going to die .
