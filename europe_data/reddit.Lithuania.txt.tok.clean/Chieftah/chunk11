  this picture was probably taken back in jan/feb , it 's ~ 10 \u00b0 c right now , so relax , we do n't have arctic climate . 
  amen * old prussian even looked fucking badass . 
  opened the season myself a few hours ago . 
  great weather to bbq them !, 
  family gatherings ! ... ... ... ... 
  edit : and ** shashlik **, 
  leaf this place , please . 
  turn off the green lamp for the lithuanian color scheme and voila , you have belgium flag color scheme . 
  i could argue that ` hoverkraftas/hovercraftas ' could be used , but i hear so rarely about this type of ship that i have no idea how to say it in lithuanian . 
  edit : apparently we use ` amfibija ' . 
  also in kunstwet and nbc are reporting 4 more stations under attack . 
  the bbc report notification about this woke me up this morning . 
  what a sad way to start a day :(, 
  just checked , you 're right , you did . 
  but not anymore , haha !, 
   honestly , the difference is miniscule , nobody cares . 
  choo choo , we 're coming for you , cyprus and spain  ) ), 
  lithuania 's gdp per capita was always higher than yours , pal , 
  [ sorry , here it is . 
  i took the info from imf and put them in a simple map .

  basically he 's trying to show off . 
  i 'll put this my grand duchy revival stash . 
  i 've been attending classes there , planning to study design or architecture myself . 
  as i said , pm me any time , 
  wow nice , if you need any help i would gladly offer it :d, 
  lithuanian does sound like italian once in a while , i sometimes notice that too . 
  look what you have done . 
  is this what you wanted ? 
  are you satisfied ? 
  they were of arabic origin and had arabic names , for the most part . 
  they were also muslims . 
  they adopted lithuanian , polish and belorussian after they settled there . 
  i can confirm this , went sailing in a lake , perfect 4g connection . 
  as i imagine it , we do n't because it 's too expensive to use continuously with no data cap , will have less coverage than cable/fiber and also will be prone to bad weather and other environmental obstacles . 
  it 's not a problem if you use a laptop , tablet or phone on-the-go , but desktop and home pcs should have stable internet connection that wo n't cost tons and stop working every time there 's a big storm . 
  like the other guy said , it really depends . 
  my plan gives me unlimited messaging , 150 minutes of calls and 3gb for ~ 7 euros . 
  well ... we 're here to help if you want to know something more . 
  we 're also # 3 in world basketball ratings after usa and spain . 
  you 're banned from / r/lithuania for unearthing our secret plan, 
  solaris trolleys are great , we have them in vilnius . 
  besides that , vilnius one of few cities in the baltics that is growing , vilnius is changing rapidly and becoming more multicultural every day . 
  i was born and still live in vilnius , i 'm biased , but if i was asked the same question i would answer `` yes '' twice . 
  bask in the greatness of this survey , this is the * only * time we will have defeated luxembourg , stockholm and copenhagen . 
  suck it , you cunts . 
  we did it . 
  bottoms up !,

  but ... but i thought ... i thought he was a yank . 
  we need a shaman , quick !, 
  true , but the prices rose several times compared to 3-4 years ago and the service is 3 times poorer . 
  i 've been to the greek islands probably 5 times ( 3 times crete , 1 time kos and rhodes ) . 
  i stayed at the same hotel and town in crete both in 2007 and in 2012 and the difference in local price and quality ratio is huge . 
  going to kos in 2014 was even worse . 
  at least they have great beaches and perfect weather . 
  tons of work , got a few design projects that i have n't started for two weeks ( luckily no sharp deadline ) and i have an elite : dangerous expedition with other players starting on thursday and i have n't prepared just yet . 
  yeah , it 's been quite hard this week . 
  night temperature at around -23 \u00b0 c , day temperature at -15 \u00b0 c , 0 % precipitation and almost no wind . 
  it 's gotten to the point that the sky is so hazy i do n't know if it 's clouds or smog anymore . 
  i ca n't open the windows in the evening anymore , because a lot of people using wood for their fireplaces and such and the residue smoke smell dissipates very slowly . 
  we were ? 
  i 'm taking extra lesson in the academy . 
  they do n't give a fuck about weather it seems . 
  i mean it was n't bad , only my nose hair literally froze . 
  off topic , just wondering what field are you in ? 
  hold on guys . 
  i 'm a licensed confirmist and internet banterer . 
  i confirm that he might not be a photographer . 
  20 % of most people are photographers , and 80 % are liars . 
  it was -20 c a few days ago and i went to art classes at 9am . 
  did n't know it was that bad till i checked . 
  seriously , do n't you guys shovel it away ? 
  same here . 
  i have a shitty digital clock that shows temperature and it 's been about 23-24c with additional heating , now i wake up in mere 16.5 degrees and barely heat up the room to 21 by midday . 
  last week : +13 c !, 
  it 's spring alright !, 
  flowers are blooming , soon the birds will ^ migrate ^ flowers ^ grass ^ forest this week : -22 c everything fucking froze . 
  everything .

  850,000 $ and not a cent more . 
  when can i expect it to be ready ? 
  religious tolerance in 16th century commonwealth ? 
  grand duchy were tolerant since the 12th something . 
  you 're so backwards !, 
  genetical mutations and finnish vodka mostly . 
  it did once on the 27th of november . 
  it stayed through the night and melted first thing in the morning . 
  no the proper american or french ones !, 
  fuck lukoil hotdogs , have you ever tried statoil 's ? 
  they 're amazing !, 
  i agree , the morning show is the only time i watch tv . 
  one or two interesting interviews , weather , news breaks and ultimately gives a happy vibe for the day . 
  i do n't think that buying or letting a neighboring aggressor build you a strategically-important object - a whole damn nuclear reactor - is a good idea . 
  i actually do n't mind the grey blocks . 
  they blend in with the clouds and the rain just perfectly . 
  do n't want to appear like an egoistic asshole or to brag , but i really like my hometown vilnius airport . 
  it 's a short distance from the city center and you can take the direct train from the central station to the airport , really useful when you want to get back home quickly without spending money for taxi . 
  the interior is easy to navigate , with a lot of useful information and signs .
