  the main registration waiting zone might be a bit loud due to it being literally right next to the main hall and the entrance , but once you get past the registration and security checks , you 're inside a comfy , quiet waiting zone with cafes , shops and restaurants along the hallway . 
  the waiting zones are divided into several sectors and have doors between each of them , so if some idiot wants to call his mum that he 's leaving for london , people on the other end wo n't have to listen . 
  there 's also a louder bar lounge area , but it is placed conveniently one floor lower and , again , with doors . 
  it has free wi-fi , that is also great . 
  it also has charging stations for phones and whatnot and it is extremely clean . 
  the only negative thing i have is that the arrival walk is quite long . 
  you have to walk across a fuckton of corridors , come several storeys on escalators ( or lifts if that 's what you prefer ) and only then you 're in the baggage claim . 
  takes anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes to make the walk . 
  home alone home alone home alone home alone every . 
  damn . 
  year . 
  ca n't agree more . 
  june is still late spring , the real heat only comes mid-july/early-august . 
  the queen has already been in lithuania ( at least ) . 
  we need the prime minister for ~ ~ pagan sacrifice ~ ~ a diplomatic visit . 
  they do n't have snake magic and witchcraft like we did . 
  a fellow currently user i see !, 
  do n't fret , it 's because nobody knows how awesome it is to live here , 
  it means that he 's going to remove kebab . 
  yup . 
  car thermometer showed +13 c at midday . 
  in other news , today most of nation 's hydrometeorology stations detected record temperatures ( 7-10c ) . 
  such high temperatures have n't been recorded since 1777 , when the stations started working . 
  i do n't remember how snow looks anymore , but i can see fresh grass blades sprouting from the ground already !, 
  i used to hate folk songs a few years ago . 
  now i love them more every day . 
  they are awesome !, 
  summerburst this year . 
  going to have david guetta and others . 
  they started putting decorations and christmas discounts right after halloween around here . 
  [ my try , no internet or map help . 
  i can honestly say the squares are starting to get on my nerves . 
  i think i 've seen a few episodes . 
  thank you !, 
  german : der alte . 
  i9as of 8:18 pm , the search is still on . 
  they closed off the main traffic arteries in the neighborhood where he escaped , people there are told not to leave their homes and stay away from windows . 
  the suspect was seen on one of the streets so now it 's just a manhunt across the district . 
  update : more than 3 000 officers ( including anti-terrorist forces ) are in the area . 
  update 2 : some info about the accident : turns out this criminal was being transported from \u0160ven\u010dionys pd ( a city ~ 85 km from vilnius ) . 
  the van stopped at one of vilnius pds to pick up another criminal and that 's when he stole the ak and ran away . 
  whether the weapon was left unprotected or taken by force is still unknown . 
  update 3 : [ here 's a video of the police arriving to the neighborhood . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbsfatwltaw ) oh and the police also confirmed that he is a drug addict . 
  update 4 : [ here 's where the action is taking place . 
  ] ( https://www.google.lt/maps/place/pa%c5%a1ilai%c4%8diai/@54.7399829,25.1741902,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x46dd9197f80d5255:0x500d18c70e9dd30 ) pa\u0161ilai\u010diai is densely-populated residential and commercial district about 8 km from the city center . 
  update 5 : reports are coming that the suspect was seen near the central railway station , which is at the other side of the city . 
  i can hear police cars going there ( or just going around ) . 
  update 6 : police choppers are scanning the streets , the railway station district was likely a false alarm but the police suspect that the criminal could hide in an abandoned hospital nearby . 
  update 7 ( 9:30 pm ) : manhunt is expanded throughout the whole city . 
  the palace of the grand dukes was evacuated and closed , so were several bigger events across the city as well as a shopping mall . 
  update 8 ( 9:45 pm ) : mass vehicle searches across the city are being reported . 
  drivers are being pulled and their cars are being searched . 
  update 9 ( 10:33 pm ) : ~ ~ new reported location - a house back in pa\u0161ilai\u010diai , close to perk\u016bnkiemis , near a motorway out of town . 
  obviously , police is already there . ~ ~ false alarm . 
  suspect still on the loose . 
  update 10 ( 11:14 pm ) : apparently police has already closed all exits from vilnius . 
  good luck to them and i 'm going to sleep . 
  i will try to keep you updated tomorrow morning though !, 
  update 11 : early reports of a suspect resembling the hunted criminal being arrested near pa\u0161ilai\u010diai . 
  i can smell a new trend coming ... more coal , boys !, 
  we need to get the photoshop engine running !, 
  we 've got work to do !, 
  tv3 ( one of the most popular channels in lithuania ) streams lol championships via their internet tv channel . 
  been there just out of curiosity . 
  the feeling is great , obviously , but i really wished they did n't organize it inside an arena . 
  it 's too small for a video game expo . 
  based on what i eat ( vilnius ) : 4-5 $ for a bowl of beef or chicken pasta 5 $ for a big chunk of lasagna 6-7 $ for a chicken breast or other standard meat dish . 
  kfc quritto costs 3.95 $ though . 
  edit : daily lunch may cost less ( around 4-4 .50 ) for soup and a main dish . 
  i 'm passing the turn to you now !, 
  yeah just saw the sign myself . 
  you 're most likely right . 
  blind guess but i think it 's west ring road ? 
  shit , my top secret plan `` overthrow estonia on / r/europe '' has been exposed !, 
  we do have it , never used it though : /, 
  the animation quality alone shows just how much money is put into propaganda . 
  it is very saddening to see beautiful castles and cities destroyed when the russians came to konigsberg . 
  have n't been there myself , but from what biased stuff i 've heard , it 's pretty shite . 
  karalien\u0117s luizos tiltas here in lithuania , so still the same . 
  do n't know about the russian version . 
  we can have dreams , right ? 
  summoning / u/paravin to teach this guy a lesson about overused latvian jokes . 
  if you mean the posting speeds , i just have my facebook open all the time . 
  this is naglis ( or parnidis ) dunes in the curonian spit , lagoon side . 
  it is , but i like wearing a single t-shirt and nothing more , so it 's still too cold . 
  that works too for about 20 minutes until the tea becomes cold and the water in the rubber bag ( that 's how it 's called ?? ), 
  starts freezing you instead of heating . 
  edit : i 'm probably wrong about the water thing , do n't use it anyway : / not useful to have a small water bag to heat a small part when your whole body is frozen . 
  i was freezing my ass off too at 18c , then i turned on the portable heater . 
  thanks for reminding me to turn it off , it 's 24c and i 'm starting to melt already . 
  tagging you as photo rival . 
  the business district is booming right now . 
  if you look at the lower picture , the rectangle-shaped highrise in far left , the oval-shaped lowrise even further left were both completed just last year , and there are quite a few projects currently under construction/design stage , such as : [ arfa ] ( https://www.spec.lt/galerija/straipsniai/konstitucijos-prospekte-iskils-auksciausias-gyvenamasis-pastatas-vilniuje/konstitucijos-prospekte-iskils-auksciausias-gyvenamasis-pastatas-vilniuje.jpeg ) , a highrise that was halted mid-construction due to the economic crisis . 
  resumed construction ~ 6 months ago , to be completed in 2017 q4 . 
  [ bure 3 tower ] ( http://3bures.lt/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vystoma_bure1.jpg ) , a third tower to accompany the first two , to be completed in 2018 . 
  [ k18b - downtown tower ] ( http://vz.lt/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/vz/20160429/article/160429448/ar/0/ar-160429448.jpg&amp;exactw=1500&amp;alignv=top&amp;imageversion=horizontalus&amp;lastupdate=834 ) , a massive project designed by daniel libeskind , currently in design stage , works should start sometime in early 2017 , to be completed around 2019 . 
  [ raddisson conference center ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/o2yczy-aw9_rkdd6x2pst8wfsjno1aixzobofjtahy91m0lhmfbkvgdhkrni4oivi9ix_dkshvbczdtax2qcpbig6z6aaygvr19wwjueqjprxoffazvmu_edhxvaqa83jm0xgb8rem6gfueciw=s16383 ) , also quite big and thank god it 's a lowrise . 
  we really need some lowrises around the tall buildings , to avoid the emptiness and make the downtown more cozy . 
  and these are just the projects that take place in the central part of the downtown .
