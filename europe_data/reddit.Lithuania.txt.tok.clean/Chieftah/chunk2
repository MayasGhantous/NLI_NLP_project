  but if we add that with +3.5 % ( or +2.9 % , was it ? ), 
  gdp growth , it should n't be that bad .

  i should 've stopped with taxis of european union ... 
  have a crispy chocolate cookie from me for that , thanks :3, 
  next will be trams of eu by me , unless someone decides to reap karma for theirselves like this time . 
  i thought i was supposed to do these lists ... 
  that cleared the doubts , thanks !, 
  i 'd like to know the source of this because last time i checked we were 2nd after romania and currently my internet speed is 65 with a simple modem connected to a local provider . 
  pretty much half of all old european trolleys look like that . 
  their shape is super classic though . 
  exactly . 
  they can still be found in some older trolleys/buses though , the ones where you actually need to push the stamper to the ticket for it to check . 
  now , because paper tickets are still used by a small number of people , we have automatic stampers , where you just put a ticket in and the stamper checks it . 
  oh god , the first one ... is that thing moving on gauges ? 
  then why the hell does it need trolley lines ?? 
  yup , skodas still rule vilnius and kaunas , but i wanted to use only the newest models of trolleys in this album , 
  paper tickets that require mechanical stamping are almost obsolete because we have a city-wide transport card system and mobile tickets . 
  tl ; dr - all new trolleys are solaris trollino - all old trolleys are skoda - bucharest 's trolley looks like a transformer ... 
  if the said current golden age continues , more and more people will start appreciating it . 
  we just need time !, 
  here , have some warm coffee to ease the pain . 
  well , they break . 
  we only have about 9 left , but i really hope someone would burn them in the bus station parking lot ... 
  95 % chance i 'll make one for wendesday . 
  yup , thanks for fixing me !, 
  [ this is how ikarus buses look in vilnius ... ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/'gelede_bus'_vilnius_-_flickr_-_facemepls.jpg ) [ even the classic skoda trolley does n't look so bad !, 
  we still have 8-9 ~ ~ ikarus ~ ~ karosa buses working in vilnius , although all other cities already sold them to the scrapyard . 
  they look like moving coffins , so no love for them , i 'm afraid . 
  that was n't me but i guess we would make an awesome team . 
  ` muricans again  . <, 
  yeah , i 'm going to do trolleybuses after this . 
  me , teacher , me !, 
  fuck no . 
  ** lithuania ** various baltic tribes lived their boring peasant and freefolk lives ... the end . 
  some coach companies have them . 
  you just probably took a different company 's coach . 
  ** do ** let the cars in the outer lane pass , all the time . 
  in fact , do n't even bother going into the outer lane unless there is a life/death reason . 
  ** do n't ** talk or speak on the phone in the bus . 
  just shut up until you reach your destination , alright ? 
  ** do n't ** sit in taxis without company name , yellow sign on the roof , quick call number ( all of the above ), 
  we moved 6 places !, 
  suddenly , i feel more intelligent !, 
  kinda good , also devoid of any cheer and happiness . 
  other than that , belgium 's anthem sounds epic !, 
  lithuania is high proficiency , you should add that if you made the map . 
  leave all your hope, 
  well of course , ** the baltic countries !, 
  ** i really like estonia and latvia , if not for different languages , we could be a single ass-kickin ' country . 
  ** poland ** - because we had a great time kicking arses back in the days . 
  i wish more people would like you in my country :( ** great britain ** - i just love the landscapes and rich history . 
  awesome !, 
  ** the netherlands ** - no mountains here either . 
  i feel you bros :(, 
  please keep doing these for our country because everyone else is too lazy to do it . 
  also , i can add that we are having a heat wave , temps reaching +32 - +36 c !, 
  damn , we really hate changing something . 
  i personally feel great . 
  partly because i do n't give a shit . 
  marshrutkas - shared taxi . 
  obsolete , i guess ? 
  how many models are there in use ? 
  that is an amazing plan !, 
  nice job , estonians !, 
  i 've seen this once . 
  is that a real taxi used on the roads everyday ? 
  or is just a one-time stunt ? 
  but but bbbb ... but ... they . . they have these cars in zagreb too ... right ? ... they do right ?? 
  i added a newer model because it 's more common than the old one . 
  in fact , i think the classic model is not even used these days . 
  woah what ?!? 
  we just opened our first fast charging station last week ... 
  take a look at my city ( vilnius , lithuania ) . 
  cars have whatever colors they want . 
  you can see blue and white cars in the pictures , but there are also black , brown , purple ( o.o ) , yellow and grey . 
  it 's terrific . 
  at least they are trying to enforce taxi drivers to have regulated yellow/black checker stripes on the sides to identify . 
  did i say we are nordic countries ? 
  ok , listen : the lithuanian flag is raised on 3 ** national ** days . 
  february 16th - restoration of the nation of lithuania march 11th - lithuanian independence day july 6th - national day ( coronation/king 's day ) now these 3 dates mark the most important events in lithuanian history , these are the things that not only helped us be who we are today but also restore our independence . 
  we raise the flag not because we feel kinda patriotic then , but because as a sign of appreciation for lithuania . 
  it 's not forced love , it 's part of what makes our country . 
  in poland you might have different laws , you might ask people living there to do different things , but nobody should bat an eye . 
  it 's ** their ** country , ** their ** traditions , ** their ** history . 
  let 's not get too globalistic on this , leave some tradition . 
  but some of the government officials tweet here too . 
  latvian potato jokes . 
  poland - formerly part of soviet union - formerly part of golden horde - formerly part of first empire of the dinosaurs . 
  you can always move to our side . 
  after ukraine crisis i unsubscribed from worldnews . 
  it is a terrible biased news reddit and they should feel ashamed . 
  that 's a major milestone !, 
  now off they go to build the stairwell so workers from the 80 's can start climbing back down . 
  more like shanghai than pyongyang . 
  kim jong-un is too poor to even show his power . 
  by lithuanians , but shops are all over the baltics , poland and bulgaria . 
  it 's billions , not millions .
