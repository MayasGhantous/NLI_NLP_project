  the worst are probably the brits - always drunk and shouting, 
  however the point is here : none of the baltic states , nor geopolitically , economically , geographically , culturally or in any other way are part of eastern europe, 
  - all eastern european states have a slavic language - eastern european country economy levels are very low ( romania being the richest with ~ $ 9.000 gdp per capita - almost all eastern european countries are russian orthodox . 
  - they all share a rather low quality of life compared to western europe . 
  - lithuania and latvia speak baltic languages and estonian is finno-ugric . 
  - latvia : $ 16.138 ; lithuania : $ 16.600 ; estonia : $ 20.179 gdp per capita - lithuania is almost completely roman catholic . 
  latvia is protestant/lutheran and estonia is atheist/protestant . 
  - our quality of life is still lower than that of western europe , but at some social or economical indices we are equal with western europe . 
  baltics or northern europe . 
  ahem ... ahem ... estonia is not eastern europe . 
  no lithuania ? 
  fine , i 'll keep pirating game of thrones then . 
  middle class people also clean by themselves because they are not that fat and lazy to hire somebody else to do it for them, 
  what about a swallow , if it 's unladen !, 
  do n't worry , mistakes like that happen all the time . 
  tourists do n't have their cars registered in croatia , do they ? 
  to anyone wondering : vehicles stands for automobiles , suvs , trucks , vans , buses and lorries . 
  also motorized freight vehicles . 
  this does n't count registered bikes or any kind of motorcycles . 
  this is great !, 
  makes me proud to live in vilnius !, 
  we do n't really fancy football here in lithuania , but oh , basketball hooligans ... 
  meanwhile lithuanian economy is +3.3 % growing . 
  finally , estonians are not first at something, 
  according to official stats , about 25 % of spain population is unemployed . 
  this is just terrific !, 
  ** lithuania ** [ hour of the wolf/vilko valanda from * steam and stone saga * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hour_of_the_wolf_ ( book ) ) by andrius tapinas . 
  it might be the only steampunk book we somebody ever wrote here . 
  it 's only in lithuanian , but english e-book version should be released soon . 
  i highly recommend reading it when it comes out . 
  edit : apparently , the english version is already [ published ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hour-wolf-steam-stone-saga-ebook/dp/b00ez3qwf0 ) the author is currently writing a second book called * days of the plague * . 
  oh , and for anyone wondering , this is not a witcher ripoff . 
  do n't worry . 
  i should 've posted it here anyway . 
  i 'm making a map for this , bear with me for some 10 minutes !, 
  high-five sponge brothers . 
  suck those funds in !, 
  shots fired !, 
  to be more precise , ~ 80 ha of forest burned down . 
  meanwhile lithuania started to work on military lasers . 
  i 'll have you know that 70 % of world 's scientific lasers are lithuanian , so we might as well be building a star wars laser spacecraft . 
  [ boom ] ( http://www.party-weekends.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/vilnius6.jpg ) [ bam ] ( http://turizmobaze.lt/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/vilnius.jpg ), 
  all i see is estonia and lithuania trying to conquer this subreddit with as many posts as possible . 
  i admit participating in this too ... 
  fun fact : vilnius is one of the greenest european capitals and the last time i saw smog here was 4 years ago during a summer drought or so, 
  [ hah , vilnius has its own too ] ( http://www.madeinvilnius.com/assets/data/media/images/img_5804_fotor.jpg ), 
  ... thanks to putin . 
  from what little i can understand a woman journalist asked him if it would be good to answer to ukraine 's decision to limit russians coming to the country . 
  he then proceeded with some random mumbling i ca n't understand and then you can hear him saying : `` what sanctions ? 
  you need to do it differently , softly !, 
  where are those fools , come here !!, 
  he * ordered * a few scared journalists to come to him . 
  `` and you , journalist , come here !, 
  i 'll order you and you will go to her [ the woman journalist who asked the question at the start ] and start cruelly raping her ! '', 
  he pushes the journalists towards the woman , they try to defend the woman from the freak whilst he screams `` christ has risen !, 
  christ has risen ! '', 
  another journalist ( a woman in white standing nearby ) tried to shame him by saying that he is insulting a pregnant woman . 
  he gave -0 fucks about it and screamed `` you 'll all lose your jobs in interfax , all of you !!, 
  do you have any more questions ?? '', 
  the end . 
  edit : afterwards his prophecised massive firing of interfax employees , he also called the women `` lesbians '' and offered her to go back where she came from . 
  yup, 
  what the fuck did i just watch ? 
  fun coincidence : i was in warsaw yesterday and stayed at a hotel in praga po\u0142udnie !, 
  correct , on 1st january , 2015 . 
  yum . 
  by the way : - copenhagen , is this the right flag i chose for ya ? 
  - prague and warsaw are ** totally ** original !, 
  - amsterdam 's flag looks like a porno cover background ... 
  because estonia wants into nordic . 
  might be , but fyi those embassies were closed due to the lack of tourists from both sides . 
  ** lithuania ** - [ a roof in one of the shops in vilnius shopping center collapsed . 
  fortunately , no one was in the store at the moment . ], 
  our warship responded and the russian warship peed his pants and sailed away . 
  so pathetic ... ] ( http://en.delfi.lt/66649/lithuania-responses-to-russian-military-ships-interference-in-its-economic-zone-201466649/ ) - [ construction started on an electricity cable across the baltic sea to sweden ] ( http://en.delfi.lt/66616/nordbalt-cable-laying-ship-to-start-work-today-in-neringa-201466616/ ) - [ we closed embassies in slovenia , portugal and bulgaria , but will open new ones in australia , brazil and south africa ] ( http://en.delfi.lt/66556/lithuania-to-close-embassies-in-slovenia-portugal-bulgaria-201466556/ ), 
  i live in melancholic modern traditional cloudy potato vodka butter coffee emotionally repressed catholic rich hard-working bad cuisined quiet homophobic new 21-day-living can-fix-my-own-sink eat-walking religious europe . 
  guess where i am ? 
  they do n't really want to invade it . 
  they are always like that - acting like a 10-year old bully . 
  i see that estonians are trying to overtake / r/europe by using beautiful photos . 
  i 'm trying to stop this invasion of beautiful estonia by giving you beautiful lithuania !, 
  we are third ... in europe ... . * could the legends be true ? 
  what they were doing was that they ordered merchant and fishing ships to avoid the area . 
  it 's like you arrange a party at your house and i come in and start pushing people outside without reason . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy, 
  you blame democracy for it , then call yourself capitalist and free market . 
  you call yourself capitalist and free market , but still think that vilnius and lviv are polish towns . 
  get your shit together man and go do something more worth your time , 
  well well what do you want me to prove ? 
  yeah this kind of answer sums up your behavior and ideology pretty well . 
  i found it rather more annoying than offensive to hear such stupid ideas . 
  - vilnius and lviv is not a part of poland since 1939 . 
  - the territorial status of both cities and modern borders is , with no exceptions , is accepted by the polish government . 
  - i see your reputation on reddit is rather shitty - why am i spending my free-from-work afternoon by arguing with a communist . 
  first , you should read some history books second , i hope you 're not as retarded in real life as you depict yourself here . 
  i live in vilnius and i found this offensive . 
  fuck you !, 
  and here , ladies and gentlemen , is a pro-russian kremlin bot example !, 
  can confirm , just made a comment on worldnews and immediately got numerous downvotes . 
  lithuania did it too , high-five for propaganda censorship , braliukas !,
