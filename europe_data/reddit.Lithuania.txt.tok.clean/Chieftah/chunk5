  there 's nothing to explain when there 's a burning limo on the streets . 
  ** lithuania ** - some guy decided to barricade himself inside his own house and threatened to blast himself . 
  cops arrived but he then decided to run away , but after a short pursuit he was finally arrested . 
  such a jerk . 
  - [ a danish ship captain that had his ship constructed in one of the dry-docks of klaip\u0117da decided to run away with his own crew without paying for the ship construction . 
  [ vilnius ncc ] ( http://www.efoto.lt/files/images/13249/vilniuss.jpg ) is being built and expanded on a swamp-clay area , but we still managed to get a 150m highrise there . 
  maybe it depends on the tenacity of the swamp ? 
  i do n't fear it personally . 
  it has calmed down for now , but it never was something paranoic . 
  grand duchy you peasants !, 
  i see r/pyongyang is getting a few friends ... 
  historically part of southern latvia was lithuanian . 
  can we get back the lands too , please ? 
  april fools done right !, 
  he 's a german-saracen prince !, 
  i do n't get it . 
  why and how can they just switch to a different timeline . 
  so 12pm is 1pm because of daylight savings + it 's now 2pm ?!? 
  fyi , our energy minister ** pleaded ** for gas from us . 
  unfortunately i read this after i wasted 12 seconds backing out of that terrible design . 
  i must be the 13 % then . 
  part of western russia also belongs to the grand duchy !, 
  oh , you read the comment section too ? 
  [ this is even better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2adv6pkgfna ), 
  this was actually very good . 
  good job estonians :d, 
  without the police force blocking them this would turn into a slaughterhouse faster than we could imagine . 
  [ what the reporter actually gave the border patrol ... ] ( http://data2.whicdn.com/images/26778405/thumb.jpg ), 
  but if the mines blow , his fields are dug and ready for plants . 
  got ta always ^ see ^ the ^ bright ^ side, 
  first seconds ... `` lem me see your id '' ... .3 seconds later `` stand fucking still '' that escalated quickly . 
  it 's in new york , right ? 
  our balcony tiles smashed to shivers . 
  they win . 
  i tried digging through lithuanian dormitories , [ kinda ] ( http://www.viko.lt/uploads/images/2013/08/2012080905.png ) [ good ] ( http://www.viko.lt/uploads/images/2013/08/2012080909.png ) , [ did n't expect that ] ( http://www.viko.lt/uploads/images/2013/08/2012080916.png ), 
  by local i mean local region ( lithuania , latvia , poland , belarus , estonia ) , mostly lithuania though . 
  yes , not all stuff is handcrafted , but some things are . 
  and yes , so many people ... 
  ** lithuania ** besides ukraine stuff everywhere ... - google included our president in the international women 's day doodle . 
  - 6 f-15 fighter jets from usa arrived to lithuania to strengthen defense . 
  - kaziuko mug\u0117 ( casimer 's fair ) happened for 411 ^ st time ( since 17th century ) . 
  it 's basically a huge fair with local crafts , foods and other local stuff being sold around lithuania . 
  - our satellite successfully received commands from the sat control center , so [ lithuania can into space ] ( http://en.delfi.lt/64854/litsat-1-successfully-follows-the-commands-of-ktu-team-in-space-201464854/ ),

  yup , i am compiling , editing and making interesting europe statistic maps that will feature the sources :o, 
  i probably have a map-editing addiction ... 
  yup . 
  i took them from 2014 estimates of each country . 
  some were on wiki , others i found on http://www.tradingeconomics.com/countries, 
  / r/mapgore someone , please make it . 
  you do n't want those metal band guys buying a flat next-door though . 
  third biggest lithuanian minority lithuania : 2.994.514 uk : 97.083 ireland : 36.638, 
  wine . 
  confim can i. german am . 
  yeah , maybe they 're hipsters , you 'll be wearing this next year . 
  lithuania recently announced that they will restrict entering to lithuania for russian officers , people with military proffesions and so on . 
  more sanctions to follow but they have n't announced yet, 
  it took only a week , and the whole of reddit went from pokemon and meme posts to speculations , war machines and strategies . 
  russia 's seen vicious leaders , it has seen idiot leaders , but i think they 've never been cursed with a vicious idiot leader . 
  polan stronk !, 
  ** lithuania ** - everything is cluttered with ukraine . 
  - we went badass and invoked article iv - protests around russian embassy , summoned ambassadors and all that stuff ... - our badass strongman has won the award of schwarzenegger 's world 's strongest man for the 7th time , also got a world record for 540 kg ( 8 hummer tyres ) lifted . 
  which probably means that they have a pretext to `` defend '' their citizens there . 
  if they would try to do anything with us , we could call on article v that would * require * nato member states to defend and intervene in the conflict . 
  as a nato member , you have this ability . 
  fyi estonia 's russian population : 24.8 % latvia 's russian population : 26.9 % lithuania 's russian population : 5.8 %, 
  it 'd be almost completely fatal for them to invade us since we are in eu and nato . 
  well , the current event could also easily lead to rather fatal sanctions or events against russia itself . 
  the biggest problem i see here is that russia signed an official document back in 1994 which said that russia ** will not ** invade or try to separate , annex or otherwise break the territorial oneness of ukraine . 
  never trust the russians, 
  make a lithuanian one !, 
  i do n't really think so . 
  attacking an eu territory would trigger so much sanctions towards russia at best . 
  wait for me guys !, 
  i forgot to buy the popcorn for this . 
  `` or log in . '', 
  the end . 
  they basically want to ban land sale for foreigners , although it is a requirement for eu states . 
  all elderly people with no understandment of world politics and douchebag nationalists signed it . 
  no shit sherlock . 
  just like many people of this caliber of murder , he will probably flee to somewhere like tahiti or fiji . 
  he should get his ass out and resign . 
  otherwise the protesters are probably gon na kill him one day for all that he 'd done . 
  we did ours back in [ 2012 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvgyqdgldsu ), 
  ** lithuania ** - car tax should be implemented , many people are against that . 
  - independence day, 
  lithuanian here . 
  i managed to get it working in 2 days , although i was quite eager and trying to speed things a little . 
  oh , and my isp is teo lt, 
  vilnius - modern , clean and has a huge old town !, 
  ca n't we just get our shit together at least once !, 
  [ oh really ?

  no you needs into north , latvia there, 
  it should be clear by now that he was basically an impractical person, 
  16th century is 1501-1600 , not 1601-1700 . 
  grand duchy was an independent state from 12th century till 1569 . 
  polan ca n't into litvuania,
