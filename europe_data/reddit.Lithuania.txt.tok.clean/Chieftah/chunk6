  studying is probably the easiest way to legally get a citizenship , but you can easily do it if you 're not studying , it 's eu after all . 
  i must however warn you that lithuanian language is extremely hard for any foreigner , unless you want to talk like a google translator . 
  you should n't have many problems and language barriers in vilnius , kaunas or klaipeda - most venues have english translations and people know english well . 
  if you know russian , it 's even better , unless you talk with 15-25 's . 
  klaipeda is also good choice if you know german . 
  i think you better check out some in-depth info about migration , i 'm not really a great helper here . 
  you probably were on the barbican , that 's the only one i remember . 
  eastern europe ca n't into baltics . 
  well , the geographical center of europe is 20 km away from vilnius , although it might be not . 
  quite the opposite , i 'd say . 
  lithuania : i 'll name cities instead of regions kaunas - bastard braggarts , ca n't fix their roads , drive with bwm x5 's like madmen and hate vilnius ' basketball team klaipeda - relatively silent , drunkards , stuck between germany and russia . 
  good weather , high winds , expensive resorts panev\u0117\u017eys - generic eastern europeans , they all wear tracksuits , eat sunflower seeds and drive old audis \u0160iauliai - have a military airport , poor . 
  druskininkai - have a crazy mayor , too many belorussian tourists var\u0117na - mushrooms and berries eveywhere , that 's all they do . 
  vilnius - rich bastards , retard mayor , if a project in your town was cancelled , always blame them, 
  we 're very pro at making human chains . 
  lithuania 's nation car : [ this ] ( http://img.favcars.com/audi/100/wallpapers_audi_100_1990_4.jpg ) ' [ and this ] ( http://www.audi.com/etc/medialib/ngw/brand/company_history/models/1965_1990/audi_80_b3.par.0014.image.jpg/704x396_4_audi90.jpg ) [ a little bit forggoten , but can be seen often in the streets ] ( http://www.mmstudios.org/ninja-fake/vw-passat.jpg ), 
  22.9 % here . 
  still not good enough . 
  ** lithuania ** + a bunch of retards thought it would be funny to call police and troll that the hotel and bus station of one of our most popular resorts are mined . 
  the hotel and bus station were evacuated . 
  + another retard thought it would be also very funny to prank the police by calling and saying that the same resort 's international airport is mined ( this happened 3 days later ) . 
  again , nothing was true , but all flights have been cancelled . 
  + one more retard thought it would be roflfunny to call the police and tell them that a night club in vilnius is mined . 
  it was a prank and everyone had a nice evening dancing outside of the nightclub with spec ops around . 
  + in other news , winter might come to lithuania . 
  banking gone wild, 
  same as in lithuanian buses or trolleybuses, 
  the baltics start to look like a star trek movie . 
  we have lazers , you have e-government . 
  you 're a pussy for lithuania, 
  is that a tree or just a spiral ? 
  a downvoter in this particular situation is a person who reasonably understands that the current russian government is neither democratic nor diplomatic , so in reality , such turn of events would n't be possible unless a new , democratic government was chosen . 
  let 's not forget the fact that russia 's poverty , corruption , homicide etc. 
  rates are way above europe 's maximum , which also means that whoever wants to create a stonger union between these two superpowers would have to lower the rates , and it costs millions of euros/roubles to do so . 
  tl ; dr your given site is very propogandic and biased . 
  get your shit together guys - russia is not europe nor can it become a part of it . 
  not you again , piss off, 
  you accidentally a word there . 
  i could completely agree to you , the russians living here ( in lithuania ) are acting just as you described . 
  maybe someone has a stream of some sort ? 
  i just heard that the company 's responsible for this project ceo had a heart attack after hearing what had happened . 
  very sad indeed . 
  is that a lithuanian flag up in norway ? 
  why ? 
  i hope this poland-lithuania divorced marriage thing will be friendly again, 
  it exists here , come to us and buy some ;d you can find them in all major pharmacies , they 're really effective, 
  the only one i can remember is the balm !, 
  i have a few of them around , they 're amazing if you got a cold !, 
  calm down , here , have a potato . 
  i hope you feel better now, 
  okay . 
  still cunts, 
  sivhd those who need it will understand it . 
  more skyscrapers . 
  someone wanted to give me bulgarian meat on the street 7 years ago , i refused . 
  i ca n't say anything more clever ... 
  poles go to lithuania/latvia latvians/lithuanians go to estonia estonians go to finland finns go to estonia/norway or do they ? 
  probably not . 
  good job estonia . 
  zhirinvosky is a bit strange ... 
  those languages where i can understand what others say . 
  yeah they wanted to shut down indepented televisions and radio stations from streaming real information about the events . 
  wut about ze ice land ? 
  he talks like a very popular soldier character from a very popular shooter game . 
  come on , do n't be that arrogant . 
  he tried to remember something and he did . 
  +1 effort points . 
  i almost shot a few jokes about greenland and suicides , but i refrained . 
  we even have a few names which greeks use as well , such as kostas . 
  some fixes  their names end in - as . 
  that 's actually incorrect , only male names end - as , but they can also end in - is ( gytis ) or - us ( vilius ) female names most commonly end in - \u0117 , - a  brief history : pagans , something to do with the teutonic order , then they formed a mighty commonwealth with poland for quite some time . 
  skip to 20th century , part of the ussr . 
  gained independence in the 90s * were * pagans , we were at war with teutonic order and the crusade in grand dutchy ages . 
  it 's in lithuania . 
  i do n't know if a similar thing happened in estonia though . 
  fine , i 'll just buy a combo meal at mcdonalds , buy some local cheese , browse some google , call my mum , play some tennis , buy some clothing , and buy a public toilet in city centre . 
  and die from hunger afterwards . 
  here comes the \u0105 \u010d \u0119 \u0117 \u012f \u0161 \u0173 \u016b \u017e, 
  i always talk in british accent and use british spelling . 
  lithuania vilnius had two storms this week , another one is coming as i 'm writing . 
  here [ take a look ] ( http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/vilniu-nuniokojo-skvalas.d?id=62052579 ) ignore the writing , just take a look at videos and photos . 
  it 's enough to understand the situation here . 
  lots of belarussians view lithuania as their `` modern '' neighbour and travel to it to buy stuff at malls . 
  belarussians are good , if not their dictator , i think they would be as awesome as latvians , estonians or other `` brothers '', 
  latvian cops were bribed with potato, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/hey-atheists-just-shut-up-please?utm_source=vicetwitterus ), 
  [ good ] ( http://d38zt8ehae1tnt.cloudfront.net/excellent_all_is_going_according_to_plan__34399.jpg?v=1359154389 ), 
  i would argue with the last statement . 
  a large number of lithuanians migrated to london and ireland , even more than to usa . 
  although , usa was the primary migration point before soviet occupation . 
  i am impatient, 
  lithuania : - our record-breaking breaststroke swimmer won gold medal and a record . 
  - suspicious bomb-like think found in central vilnius . 
  - a man jumped from 7th floor in an apartment block . 
  minecraft, 
  here in lithuania we can also vote online and pay for parking via sms . 
  they just were the first to implement it . 
  potato, 
  have a bite of this traditional lithuanian rye bread [ rugin\u0117 duona ] ( http://www.15min.lt/images/photos/597379/big/1223922661duona.jpg ), 
  never go full retard .
