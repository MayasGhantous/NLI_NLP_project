  to be honest , i actually agree with you . 
  who gives a flying fuck about bilingual streetnames ( lt and pl ) in polish-inhabited villages ? 
  i for sure as hell do n't care at all and do n't see a reason for other to care . 
  that 's the last reason he 's doing it for . 
  we 've been having awful relations with poland , that 's why . 
  and everything we hear about here is how he `` skipped '' lithuania and chose estonia instead . 
  lithuania is 0.00, 
  yeah , when was the last time he made a singing chain , huh ? 
  you 're 9 years older than us , happy national day !, 
  edit : that is to say that our country was first mentioned 1006 years ago . 
  who knows what sort of nation our pagan ancestors had ... 
  neris is low too here in vilnius . 
  i can see weed and dirt creeping from above water surface already . 
  i do n't see anything wrong . 
  aaand time to watch all of his movies again ... 
  top kek . 
  this will be interesting , i can see / r/russia having the final field day already . 
  now you 're on watchlist , good luck !, 
  same here . 
  just drive out of vilnius on vilnius-klaipeda highway and there 's a huge inflatable t-rex fluttering in the wind . 
  no , but i 'd love to . 
  i just want to relax and read a book , eat food or sleep . 
  i do n't want to have everyone staring at me stuffing food or picking my nose . 
  i also do n't want ~ ~ those fucking children ~ ~ younglings to run past me throwing sand and stones on me . 
  also because wind , i guess . 
  lithuanian prime troll, 
  what 's with this new youtube design . 
  was n't the last one good enough ? 
  let 's go for it , reddit !, 
  works now . 
  [ what about these guys ? 
  hey let 's not start a flame war between poland and lithuania . 
  bagpipe is a badass instrument . 
  the * cornudeptia * . 
  exactly that . 
  when i 'm on vacation i wake up at 6am and run my way to the beach with a towel as some colonist bringing a flag . 
  nah , they 're just going to put in in gr\u016btas or some obscure museum . 
  well , i never liked nazi history or anything to do with it in the first place , but from what little i know in my limited knowledge on the matter , there were people at the time who sided with the nazis , those who sided with stalin and those who tried or pretended to remain neutral , as is with every choice . 
  thus i would n't say it is n't true - there are neo-nazis and other scum in lithuania ( a small number but they exist ) , there are people who still view this complex part of our history in their own way , choosing their own sides , but i do n't think that generalizing that selective group of people as `` the country '' is a very pleasing and accurate description . 
  the text might be true , but the title is too sensationalist , and given the active backlash regarding this topic , such a title does hurt a lot . 
  wow did n't expect a fiat there . 
  bmw or vw as usual more likely . 
  i wonder , why fiats are so good-selling but still are so scarce on the roads ? 
  oh for fucks sake estonia . 
  popular again ? 
  hey why do n't you want to cooperate with us ? 
  together we can be stronger !, 
  join the cool club !, 
  maybe i 'm missing something , but the pope is not from a royal family . 
  by the looks of your fridge he 's either really failing at finding boobs or just sucks at this . 
  source : note that the right magnet includes neither boobs nor royal families .

  well we just had a massive thunderstorm . 
  finally some fresh air !, 
  you must be somewhere near the coast . 
  bloody bbq here in vilnius . 
  edit : shit , it was +30 c when i woke up , now it 's +34 c. 
  and before mindaugas ? 
  after traidenis ? 
  it was medieval as usual , nothing too unique at that time . 
  they basically hacked and slashed each other for centuries . 
  game of thrones style . 
  belarus , lithuania , ukraine and parts of russia with the great duchy .

  i 'm retarded !, 
  ofc it is !, 
  everyone has their own opinion . 
  imo life in lithuania is great . 
  no need to be so pessimistic . 
  i will maybe tomorrow, 
  international monetary fund 's gross domestic product at purchasing-power parity . 
  the closest data i can find where all four countries are shown is 1999 : czech republic : $ 15,473 ( 91.75 % increase ) lithuania : $ 9,173 ( 207.9 % increase ) slovakia : $ 11,944 ( 141.9 % increase ) slovenia : $ 16,954 ( 78.7 % increase ), 
  strange , imf did n't give me the newest data when i started a new query . 
  lithuania . 
  ehhmm ... we 're not at the very bottom . 
  we are doing pretty well .
