  i never thought united states was that far south . 
  damn you mercator !, 
  ruth hi mercator !, 
  cheers , justice has been served !, 
  edit : looks like they reverted the deleted threads . 
  we won !, 
  that 's a tough kind of censorship . 
  i 'm open to post it again , this time with more evidence . 
  nothing to do ? 
  * from about 30 people who fell victims to this attack , more than half , if not all , were european citizens ( french , german , british mostly ) * tunisia is in europe 's * neighborhood * , as the sidebar so gently puts . 
  * the hotels are part of a spanish firm . 
  * it happened just a few hours after a terrorist attack in france , thus the possibility of a planned international terrorist attack is always possible . 
  * if pretty much everyone wants to discuss it on / r/europe , the mods have no right to stand blind before the community they moderate and delete the discussions . 
  if that 's the case , it 's plainly stupid . 
  what is the point of restricting content based purely on `` happening in europe '' ? 
  if this is a subreddit about europe and its neighborhoods , as stated in the sidebar , then it 's wrong . 
  we * are * talking about things that are affecting europe . 
  european citizens were killed there . 
  not one , not two , more than 20 . 
  it is a terrorist attack that strangely correlates together with france attack this morning . 
  and even if that is n't enough , * the community itself wants to talk about it . 
  * we 're not slaves to our subreddit overlords , who tell us what we can and ca n't do . 
  moderators are only here to ** moderate ** the subreddit , not do whatever they want , throwing good discussions left and right . 
  yikes , i will get banned for that !, 
  i give up !, 
  let 's ban everyone who does n't have a european flair !, 
   these acts shatter steel , but they can not dent the steel of american resolve . 
  jet fuel also ca n't melt steel beams . 
  how is this not a european story ? 
  what counts as a sufficiently european one ? 
  hey i 'm not saying they 're doing a good job with moderation , but let 's not get down to the level of personal attacks . 
  i do n't want to create flaming or widespread hate against the mods , but at least in my honest opinion , the mods of / r/europe are doing a pretty bad job maintaining the subreddit . 
  change after change , almost all of them are massively downvoted by our community . 
  just my two cents on the matter . 
  edit : if rules are vague enough to misinterpret , they are bad rules . 
  if one wants people to follow rules , they have to be clear and detailed . 
  all in roughly 3-4 hours . 
  i 'm a bit suspicious about the source . 
  same source was linked the now-frontpage / r/worldnews thread of the same title . 
  they do n't seem like a very trustworthy news site and no lithuanian media sites have any info about this . 
  smells kinda fucky imo . 
  it 's a big deal for me . 
  i started learning english almost immediately after i learned to read . 
  video games and tv taught me english better than any teacher would have at that age . 
  now , english is such a big part of my everyday life , that i 'm even thinking in english half of the time and sometimes even formatting my sentences in english first before saying them in lithuanian . 
  very good , but can you please make image thumbnails appear near image link posts ? 
  it 's really easier than immediately pressing . 
  mash it , boil it , put it in a stew . 
  it fits everyone and everything !, 
  * for everything else , there 's mastercard \u2122 *, 
  what the fuck is that ? 
  [ / r/worldnews has insight coverage of the event , as always ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tsmdjmj.png ), 
  woah . 
  it 's not his first time : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lndmbtgxnai https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfgzdwhbk30, 
  he actually did this . 
  he 's that rad . 
  * now already obviously , here all try translate incorrect . 
  * why everyone suddenly started talking in two languages ? 
  still my water-of-choice when it comes to neutralizing my taste buds . 
  edit : just checked the kitchen and there 's no borjomi , only infidel perrier ... 
  we have those too . 
  i have been drinking borjomi almost exclusively for the last 5 years or so . 
  that 's one damn good mineral water to occasionally sip when you 're thirsty . 
  too bad it does n't come in simple water flavor . 
  well that 's what i meant , * our * colonies . 
  there 's a monument to courlander colonists in port-of-spain . 
  hey , those were * our * colonies !, 
  i tip my fern wreath for you , good sir !, 
  when duchy of courland got their colonial territories , they were vassals of polish-lithuanian commonwealth so it 's kinda our colonies too ... amirite ? 
  it 's also old , back then situation was n't as good , with crisis at the doorstep etc. 
  latvia was my favorite !, 
  memorable and rather unique song !, 
  `` 12 points from russia go to ... russia !, 
  ** ha ha !, 
  sarcasm through the roof . 
  trying to trick us into voting for you , you viking raider !, 
  voted for latvia . 
  fucking awesome song and the only one that 's not garbage . 
  good luck latvia !, 
  nice crowd control . 
  it 's like the people actually govern the country !, 
  ooc i ' e always believed in the empire and supported it , but in their current position they 're very weak : the emperor is killed , valenwood , morrowind , elsweyr , argonia and hammerfell are lost , the dragonfires burn no more . 
  the empire is really facing one of its darkest hours right now and only through their diplomatic prowess did they manage to prevent a full on war against thalmor - a war they would lose . 
  one of the things i like about ulfric is his immigration policy proposal . 
  stop letting unskilled dark elves take our jobs !, 
  stormcloaks , definitely . 
  great policies and influential leader . 
  do n't cry , nordic boy , come here and join us !, 
  that 's because brothers are together forever < 3, 
  the only thing that is n't retarded in that video are the effects . 
  from the technical side , it 's a really well done video . 
  ^ too ^ bad ^ it 's ^ complete ^ and ^ utter ^ shit . 
  [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxijcfvds0e ), 
  estonians and their precedence complex . 
  they pretty much failed : they crossed belarus and arrived at lithuanian and polish border checkpoints and were n't allowed . 
  there 's almost no way they can get to berlin . 
  build a war base and claim the part for lithuania . 
  because everyone needs a war base . 
  wednesday .
