ha , look who wants to be easter european now , 
  alright , i get it , you mean they should have divided europe in two parts ? 
  you mean like hitler and stalin ? 
  great idea man , i 'm so proud of innovative and modern people like you !, 
  the paranoia you guys have from nato is hilarious and sad . 
  mostly sad and stupid . 
  i say the true meaning of this expansion is overshadowed by some sort of conquest , when in reality it only expanded because of a plead . 
  there is a huge difference . 
  when is the right time to join ? 
  if we had n't joined then , we could n't join now , like georgia , ukraine , etc. 
  i understand what you mean , but my statement is the more correct oversimplification . 
  exactly !, 
  that 's what i always tell people who complain about american dominance in europe . 
  there is only one way to make that one history too . 
  with being able to defend ourselfs by ourselfs . 
  and how / u/unicycling _ dinosaur already said : it leaves the impression that people how claim nato expanded ( aggressively ) do n't see the regions in eastern europe as independent and souverain states . . 
  absolutely correct in all things you said . 
  still , my heart belongs to latvia for ever !, 
  at least he was embarrassed and deleted his comment . 
  i am not gay , but i want this eurogay thing to happen in the baltics !, 
  well , it is a bit outside of vienna : https://www.google.at/maps/place/otto-wagner-spital/@48.1920792,16.3654511,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x476d082f46bb07d1:0xcd46fff940b2a9cd, 
  in lithuania i love the lesser known forest museum `` girios aidas '' ( echo of the forest ) in druskininkai : [ in summer ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cuiisug.jpg ) [ in winter ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a2xkblz.jpg ) outside of lithuania ... 
  the otto wagner church in vienna/austria : [ inside and outside view ] ( http://imgur.com/a/hzj36 ), 
  we are very happy !, 
  the only problem is , the commonwealth unlithuanised and polonised the grand duchy . 
  but still , best time ever - and in the future we 'll be friends and keep our culture at the same time . 
  finally . 
  now i hope they do n't bomb it ... like when we sold [ mazeikiu nafta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orlen_lietuva#major_fire_in_october_2006 ) to poland instead of russia . 
  literally hitler, 
  go home fake-latvia . 
  you 're drunk . 
  man , i guess when poland is surrounded by the eurozone they 'll start wanting it too . 
  i was very embarrassed at first , then i took a look at the map . 
  it 's not thaaat badly misplaced , considering i did purely from memory . 
  man , what 's up with the feels to lithuania ? 
  lithuania , austria and germany as home country , because i 've lived there long enough . 
  that really is good news !, 
  ** this was genocide ** no , they did n't put it like that . 
  maybe you heard it like that . 
  ** russia did vs usa did ** many things the us did are horrible . 
  but funny and cute , compared to those things the russians or the nazis did . 
  ** russian minority is oppressed ** it oppresses itself . 
  if they do n't like to learn the language of the country they live in , they can go a few kilometers back to their homeland . 
  they 're even allowed to from both sides . 
  learn it or leave . 
  thank spain !, 
  so , in estonia ** it 's december 2015 already . 
  . absolutely . 
  beer is like a magical potion for me too . 
  i get fluent in every language i heard once or twice in my life . 
  correct generalizations are often difficult to state , but those wealthy guys from munich are just as bad at talking english as the next drunk football fan . 
  unfortunately i had a lot of business with them . 
  in my opinion the best english speaking germans are the upper middle class people . 
  which is quite the majority anyway . 
   how do you ** ship **, 
  we do n't like to talk about this . 
  the was ? 
  no country will drop out , because as soon as they drop out they 'll start to work for getting in again . 
  that 'd be insane, 
  you 're talking bullshit . 
  would n't that work with absolutely any germanic language ? 
  the usa tried to intervene at the beginning , yet the russian government vetoed it at the uno council and we watched for another few months how everything escalated . 
  the same as balts in europe ? 
  who needs them ? 
  fuck their inferiority , not our problem . 
  you 're not really thinking a lot . 
  you only think what is suiteably and more comfortable to you in this moment . 
  the natural way ... . . 
  most slovakian emigrants emigrated simply because life sucked in slovakia . 
  this is the natural way you talk about . 
  not even because of war . 
  remember that . 
  it 's true not only for slovakia . 
  yes , i 'm worried about my country , but there are still ten times more of us than icelanders in iceland and nobody needs to worry about them . 
  so our demography is a different problem . 
  the priority is helping people who really need help right now - it does n't matter who they are . 
  what about the thousands who already fled your country during darker times ? 
  and would you blame them if they would flee because a brutal blitzholocaust would be happening ? 
  i would fight for my country too . 
  but if it would be as brutal as in syria ... 
  i do n't know what i would do . 
  the cause is probably a good education and the lack of a inferiority complex . 
  but if we talk about stereotypes , how 's life in moms basement ? 
  best year of my life, 
  but they are trying to kill our culture !, 
  do n't you see it ? 
  the mean kids at my pre school are all brown and superior :( ( (, 
  everything we have as a society depends on good people like you . 
  even if you have n't done anything , the thought alone is good enough . 
  i hope you will act too !, 
  you can start by driving by and meeting them personally , bringing them food and cloths . 
  i think only then you might understand them and get inspired in what they might really need . 
  good luck and maybe you could keep us updated . 
  hooooo ... ly shit ... that looks like a family guy skit . 
  it 's not about a club scene it 's simply not wanting to live in a bauernhof . 
  i say that , too . 
  i just refuse to say eastern europe . 
  i rather say north-east of poland , right below latvia . 
  [ everybody knows us ... : / ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbez2sqkwc ), 
  you should try it with north of lithuania , bro !,
