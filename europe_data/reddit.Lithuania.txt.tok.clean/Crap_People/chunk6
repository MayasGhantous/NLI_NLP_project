  oh god . 
  i get annoyed by it too sometimes , although i almost only comment on russia related topics . 
  but you ca n't change the current situation . 
  it 's dark times and everything about the future of europe depends on how this crisis will be solved . 
  that 's a noble move . 
  it 's easy to get the argument of ( younger ) germans - that they 're not responsible for the nazi terrors , that time has past and so on . 
  but do n't forget that there are still millions living bad lives , because of the outcome of the world war . 
  they are also not responsible for anything but they have to pay for the consequences the war brought to them . 
  i 'm not talking exactly about greece here , but this is my general position to `` late '' reparations . 
  you 're probably an expert now , so i 'll give you some more in depth details . 
  well you can remember , that our prussian and lithuanian brothers in the west of lithuania got wiped out and thus we have no great coastline or any claim to a bigger coastline anymore , because it belonged/belongs to germany , poland and russia now . 
  so remember for lithuania : she is pressed into the deep forests of slavic neighborhood . 
  but she is holding the fort . 
  memel , our only gate to the modern world ^ s/s/s / s / stays our only hope for an entry into the ~ ~ hanseatic ~ ~ nordic league . 
  pretty fine . 
  finland stays baltic and therefore in the `` russian sphere of influence '' . 
  russians take longer to understand new concepts . 
  i do n't know , if you meant that ironically , but all of us are dependend on the us and nato . 
  nem\u012bz karstu , pisties , everything is clear . 
  and now i know that dirst/dirsti ( ? ), 
  means ( to ) shit , so everything is even clearer !, 
  til we could communicate in latvian as long as we 're swearing . 
  i thougt the famous `` made in germany '' became only a real `` brand '' during wwii . 
  the reason was to mark german products so you can boycott them ( although the quality was too good to boycott ) . 
  i 'm so going to fuck for this . 
  i 'm serious . 
  but i have to convince my gf for two more . . 
  some lithuanians ( and i guess others from non 1st ^ est world countries ) just love to diss their country only to seem above the miseries there . 
  in my opinion they are often part of the problem . 
  mixed blood is healthy blood , so if a lithuanian girl likes you : jackpot !, 
   old baroque city really ? 
  that would 've made it the most northern baroque city in the world !, 
  was it original baroque ( 1600s ) or from a later period ? 
  the only baroque city that far in the north i know is vilnius of course . 
  i guess that 's why sweden is interested in it ( by putting banks everywhere ) , since narva is n't what it used to be anymore . 
  sad . 
  we put rocks on every `` important '' place . 
  [ sometimes we ^ or ^ the ^ ice ^ age put a rock in a place only to make the place itself more interesting . 
  everybody loves basketball , while some of us are just opportunistic . 
  oh my god , romanians and hungarians talk the ugliest language to each other . 
  it 's worse than anything i 've heard before . 
  ( and i 'm not taking sides , but while i am at it , get rid of your shitty episode called orban and the rest of those shitty parties . 
  if you do that , you will be loved as fuck . 
  or fucking loved . 
  or lovely fucked . ), 
  and not playing along the rules , but getting away with anything because german and so developing new standards , on which other countries have to adjust . 
  so , fellow europeans , the rules are changed now !, 
  only one word from now on . 
  jealoussss ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  and of course [ this beautiful piece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ngbrlhge7s ) . 
  but as i look through the videos , it seems like it 's also the favourite of some nazis . 
  well the text is really not nazilike , but just old suited for partisans . 
  wow i did n't know that . 
  i almost ca n't believe that because he was always anti russian . 
  but i prefer grybauskaite anyway . 
  i forgot i was talking to a western military expert . 
  i say 500 000 soldiers protecting their own land , is better than 20-30 000 professional soldiers only . 
  also that does n't mean there would n't be a professional army around . 
  [ that 's not my idea , you debate something much greater . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/militia#switzerland ), 
  i do n't really know what you mean , but i 'm interested . 
  but in before , who does n't have dark chapters - the older you get , the more chapters you create/gather . 
  yes , but the law is about to get changed . 
  we 'll have the forced enscription soon ( back ), 
  is it summer in the netherlands or why are n't you at school ? 
   those who are part of defence league or who have passed military service - yes . 
  same for us . 
  and the same for latvia . 
  where 's the problem ? 
  do you think everybody is stupid ? 
  we did n't talk about the training , because it 's self explanatory that every citizen would need to pass training first . 
  like in sitzerland or israel . 
  as we said . 
  also , if you 're not very well informed , i can tell you more about it . 
  everyone would have one or several guns in their houses , but ** no ** ammunition . 
  ammunition is only given during a crisis ( which hopefully will never ever come . 
   but conscription is also needed to teach that every citizen how to hold a gun properly . 
  of course . 
  a gun for every citizen implies training beforehand . 
   we have the mentality that every man can at least point and aim the gun . 
  i think that has passed your heads . 
  and * can * every man really use a gun ? 
  i 'm all for it . 
  if you want your small country to stay free , every citizen has to defend it by him/herself . 
   the only thing which may actually work is a well developed network of national guard units all over the baltic countries , every loyal citizen having his machine gun packed and sealed in his closet at the arm 's reach . 
  hidden weapon and supply caches , communication equipment and so on . 
  we need something like this . 
  i guess it 's something like the swiss and/or israeli model . 
  how * you * doooin ' ? 
  that is in no way important . 
  our former president , [ valdas adamkus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valdas_adamkus ) , grew up in the united states , too . 
  he too had a strong accent , but he was one of our best presidents so far . 
  very patriotic and very wise . 
  respect, 
  also nato did n't eat us , but we begged to be swallowed . 
  and thank god nato countries allowed us to enter . 
  several large baltic newspapers belong to swedes and norwegians . 
  like www.15min.lt and delfi.lt / . lv / . ee . 
  i am sure there are even more . 
  reading the content you notice that they write much more liberal that it truly feels in the baltics .
