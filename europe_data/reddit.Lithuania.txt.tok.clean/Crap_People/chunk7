  but that 's a good thing in my opinion . 
  nothing is wrong with calling us baltic states !, 
  that 's 100 % correct . 
  it 's only wrong to assume , that all of us talk baltic languages - because estonia does n't . 
  also , nobody should call us nordic , because none of us are nordic , yet . 
  but we want to be some time . 
  nordic is not limited to scandinavia , but to the northern and baltic see region and up to greenland . 
  it is an strategical and economical partnership . 
  who would n't want to join , if you 're already in this region . 
  that 's because apparently you 're studying the wrong languages , man !, 
  ritoania go wa ii go desu , yoooooooo ! ^ my ^ japanese ^ got ^ baaaad ... 
  nice one , i think he buys it . 
  i did n't say we were nordic !, 
  i said we were seen as part of northern europe , at least in the year 1918 . 
  during the gdl times we were too big and therefore reaching too far into the south and east . 
  but was that actual baltic lithuania ? 
  no way . 
  therefore it does n't matter where vikings tried to pillage . 
  it matters where we are now . 
  how do you feel today ? 
  as a lithuanian/balt ? 
  or as a belorussian ? 
  times change . 
  it 's not about the actual geographical location . 
  it 's about perception and cognitive heuristics . 
  we were and are in northern europe . 
  the soviet occupation made it look , like every country behind west germany in the east is eastern europe . 
  if you tell anybody in the west ( seriously , try it ) , that estonia is just half a centimeter under finland on a map , they wo n't believe it , unless they are map-lovers . 
  that 's the same how it 's hard to comprehend how far down cyprus is . 
  it 's so close to turkey and lebanon , yet everybody would assume it 's near greece and or even italy . 
  and people only assume this wrongly , because it is a western nation in their minds . 
  it is our challange to change these perceptions of our area . 
  of course not ( or not only ) through posts on the internet , but through actual hard work in our countries and politics . 
  and of course through saving our independencies . 
   and no i did n't assume you were stupid . 
  thanks , man . 
  i love how everybody on the internet always assumes the other person is stupid . 
  i know . 
  we were northern , until russia occupied us . 
  ** what connects us : ** we all had horrible times with our neighbors - got invaded , got occupied , looted and were held back . 
  our main goal is to be as far away from russia as possible and to secure our independence like finland did . 
  this is also the reason , why we try to become nordic one day . 
  if finland had n't aligned with the nordic bloc , nobody cared that much if russia one day decided to invade them again . 
  so for us , the longig to be considered as baltic and/or nordic is very important . 
  what many people from the nordic countries do n't know ( i guess ) is that our integration process is already ongoing . 
  estonia is just the loudest , but it is the long term goal of all our countries to join in . 
  there 's already the [ nordic-baltic-8 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nb8 ) , and we are alle observer states in the nordic council - ** the only ** observer states !, 
  also , our media is controlled by a large part of our northern ( or should i say western ? ), 
  partners . 
  our banks are nordic banks , and so on . 
  so in short : we are connected by our geographical position , our history of being occupied by the same powers and our goal to break free and look for a brighter future . 
  ** why we 're different : ** although we 're so close together , we 've developed very distinctive . 
  one reason is because our lands were grabbed by 3-5 different powers . 
  there was a time , when lithuania was an independent state and latvia and estonia were a country owned by the livonic order . 
  then our state was owned by poland , while our shores and lands at the same time were considered by swedes , germans and danes as their rightful clay . 
  this is why we 've been divided for a long time until the russian empire grabbed us all in the 18th century . 
  also , our langauges are distinctive , especially estonian belonging to the finnic branch - and latvian and lithuanian forming the surviving branch of the baltic languages . 
  so our relationship is quite good , because we never had serious conflicts with each other . 
  only the imperial powers who ruled us ( or tried to rule ) made troubles . 
  . . what happened , i think this is my longest post on reddit . 
  usually i 'm this annoying one-liner guy . 
  i hope all of us can one day consider ourselves as nordic . 
  at least i consider myself northern and not central european or even eastern european . 
  they babies are coming !, 
  slowly ... - but they 're coming !, 
  that 's no filter . 
  that 's grey baltic reality . 
  eesti can break into nordic . 
  reduce freedom of press , ban prescription free contraception , start logging your forests away . 
  poland is becoming a south american country . 
  jo , but we use it all the time . 
  only happy little accidents . 
  you simply do n't know what populist means . 
  you just noticed it has a negative connotation and you realized that you like parties which are called populist . 
  populist means they are proposing simple solutions for extremely complex problems . 
  they speak the language of simple folks ( lat populus ) . 
  their solutions are as brilliant as the solutions of your local bars alcoholic crowd . 
  `` leave eu - now !, 
  self governance for our own people ! '', 
  ( your employer might have a different opinion . . ) `` euro - teuro '' ( ger . 
  euro - expensivo . 
  cool slogan ) `` foreigners ( or muslims ) out ! '', 
  ( what are you gon na do ? 
  forcefully move them ? 
  . . kill ? 
  welcome to the hitler and stalin club ), 
  well the vytis works just like the threatening colours of a harmless bumble-bee . . 
  man , they look exactly as the old litas . 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  more like the afd is a modern sprout of a nazi party . 
  i 'm not saying they are nazis already , but they 're populists and certainly on their way . 
  npd is simply put nsdap 's grandson . 
  great . 
  first they get rid of the muslims , then the balkan immigrants , then whoever has n't a favourable skin-colour , then other slaws , then somewhere surely the few balts ( me ) , and then all other foreign populations except for diplomats . 
  and then who 's left ? 
  german people who disagree . 
  those will be especially dangerous . 
  populism 101 . 
  you 're doing a great job !, 
  not that bad ... also - give it 3-5 years ...
