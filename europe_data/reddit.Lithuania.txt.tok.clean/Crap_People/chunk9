  not when i see how they treat the new bundesl\u00e4nder like sachsen , brandenburg , etc. . . 
  you forgot the radio station for real quality : [ neringa fm ] ( http://neringafm.lt/ ), 
  that song is called caravan from duke ellington . 
  damn beautiful, 
  where am i ? 
  * what * am i ? 
  it better should be wearing a helmet heheheee, 
  do n't you think rebuilding is the least one could do ? 
  this guy wants to unite germany with austria . 
  can he finally make his mind up ? 
   ( time zone with helsinki and athens in it ) oh man , our need to justify being somehow associated with ee is hilarious :d, 
  lithuanians fucked up during ww2 and its a shame many collaborated with the nazis . 
  but i think what he meant is that isreal is waging an extremely unequal war against the former inhabitants of the area . 
  sergey lavrov denies that jessica alba is a very hot chick . 
  mlga, 
  i asked myself , what do you want to tell us . 
  then i took a look at your comment history to confirm my suspicion : you are obsessed with russias total innocence in every matter . 
  because your and all other members borders are in the hands of the eu . 
  if your country did n't like that agreement , it should n't have joined in the first place . 
  i was shocked and sad when uk voted to leave , but now there 's one special snowflake less , who would block every other eu decision . 
  absolutely . 
  http://www.unhcr.ie/about-unhcr/facts-and-figures-about-refugees you are wrong . 
  i call that loving . 
  i love it !, 
  thanks , haha !, 
  that was awsome . 
  yes, 
  i sincerely hate almost everything which is not old school italian . 
  my italian ex-gf educated me in a lot of ways . 
  in italy you would never get sliced pizza . 
  it 's italian pizza with slices of wiener sausage . 
  kill them first . 
  then kill us ... of course rightfully : /, 
  i will take it, 
  not really . 
  i must say i frequently see waiters bringing the bottle , but i rarely see someone actually eating it with ketchup . 
  ten years ago though it was uneatable without ketchup . 
  fuck , why did you have to upload that ?!, 
  shit , man . 
  takk , island , 
  they still should do it . 
  they already made actions for lesser events . 
  there are still many teams with players who have turkish roots . 
  and no , that would be no disloyalty to their current nationality in my opinion . 
  but the main reason is , they memorate even less tragic events . 
  shame !, 
   that 's a pretty sexy goat though fixed it . 
  before you laugh - click the link . 
  she really * is * pretty ... 
  very well written !, 
  ahh . . you would n't even get a job in the best circumstances . 
   a referendum two years later on continuing membership resulted in 67 % approval . 
  are you blind ? 
  there even was a referendum . 
  seriously , did you even click it ? 
   membership of the european union has been a topic of debate in the united kingdom since the country joined the european economic community ( eec , or `` common market '' ) in 1973 . 
     [ ... ] a later application was successful and the uk joined in 1973 ; a referendum two years later on continuing membership resulted in 67 % approval . 
  [ 7 ] political integration gained greater focus when the maastricht treaty established the european union ( eu ) in 1993 , which incorporated ( and after the treaty of lisbon , succeeded ) the eec . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ] and between 1975 and 1993 there was much more drama . 
  if you care to find out , you can google the rest by yourself . 
  yes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum%2c_2016?wprov=sfla1 ** edit ** : how about clicking and reading it , before you downvote ? 
  that 's probably the difference between a convincing and a heartwarming poll . 
  yeah , his grin gave it away though . 
  totally for manu . 
  i did n't try to prove anything and i do n't even need to , because the results are coming today , if you did n't know . 
  you can say what you want about bild ( and i mostly want to say bad things about bild ) , but they know how to get to certain masses . 
  yeah , or like turkey !, 
  spread ... evolve ... dude , you might be gay as duck , hahaha, 
  his neighbor might marry a man and he will be forced to masturbate to this fact . 
  otherwise there is no reason to oppose something which does n't affect yourself in a harmful way . 
  conservative societies do n't achieve a lot . 
  take a look at the globe , if you still do n't know what i mean . 
  i 'm glad you did n't expect anything else from baltic pride in lithuania . 
  pic [ 8 . jpg ] ( http://ifoto.delfi.lt/show_display.php?id=6803874.jpg&amp;width=1000&amp;height=1000&amp;mode=-1 ) is where it 's at . 
  so hottt, 
  you know , the sun is also far away , but you still see its light < 3, 
   started anti jewish pogroms killing 94 % of all jews in the country that 's right , that happened . 
  no need to downvote you for the truth . 
   did n't deport enough this is the problem . 
  they took my grandparents and most people i know in lithuania can say the same . 
  thank you, 
  no , the non-normal ones . 
   i feel closer to austrians and hungarians ( atleast the normal ones ) what about non-normal austrians ? 
  aah . . i 'm stupid . . 
  i heard that for the first time . 
  and i do n't really think that 's true . 
  also , the russian minority really is n't that large . 
  about 5-6 % i think . 
  lithuania is the dumbest country in europe , or at least , the eu , if we look at these statistics . 
  i do n't know for sure , but , as a psychologist , the only explanation i can think of is that depression and alcoholism significantly lowers performance in iq tests . 
  as lithuania has the highest rates of both factors in europe , this might be a possible explanation . 
  nice, 
  think about luxembourgish . 
  that sounds like gibberish french . 
  not because it 's related to french , but because it 's a tiny area , which has always been in francophone vicinty . 
  that was a great explanation . 
  thank you for that !, 
  or dj bobo ? 
  the tatars did n't invite the russians to colonize the east ... 
  they just came and now the tatars should be thankful that they can stay ?
