i really liked how they showed us . 
  100 % perfectness . 
  * ^ ^ ^ we 're ^ ^ ^ very ^ ^ ^ different * . 
  if it 's about the work they would n't move out . 
  ninja in training . 
  she was sitting next to him in tram . 
  our government , let alone people do n't want to endanger themselves , what we see in sweden , france , germany is more than enough to not take large mass of people without any id 's . 
  they can call us what ever they want . 
  i 'm just waiting a far better and efficient plan , than this enforced `` multiculturalism '' . 
   ** it 's not about the money ** . 
  it 's about the hope they can build a future . 
   being paid to do nothing is of course better than war , but many ( most , i would guess ) would ** yet prefer to be paid ** for their work . 
  mmm ... what . . ? 
  make up your mind . 
  they 're economic migrants not refugees , that try to enter country without paperwork or any document . 
  they most likely will end up in black market as an illegal worker , since most of them do n't have any education , so in no way they 're coming here for `` safe '' future , they just want easy money . 
  like yours is ? 
  quit bitching . 
  lithuania accepted to take 1k ~ refugees this year , but none of them want to be here because most of them are not bloody refugees , but a bloody economic migrants . 
  edit :  latvia -- latvia decided to receive 250 migrants in the next two years according to the eu plan . 
  national alliance party expressed its disapproval of such decision . 
  on 4 august 2015 around 250 activists gathered in riga on a protest against government 's decision on receiving migrants . 
   lithuania -- lithuania decided to receive 325 migrants , although after the increase of migrant flow in august 2015 , its government did not discount the possibility of accepting a greater number of migrants later in the same year . 
   poland -- government officials stated that the country is ready to take 2,000 refugees . 
  [ 453 ] polish president andrzej duda rejected the european union 's proposal of compulsory migrant quotas , saying : ** `` i wo n't agree to a dictate of the strong . 
  i wo n't back a europe where the economic advantage of the size of a population will be a reason to force solutions on other countries regardless of their national interests '' ** . 
  besides our government take it 's own citizens as priority , muslims are known to cause trouble . 
  you know nothing . 
  yet . 
  wrong title , but dope church and harbour . 
  yes , of course we have to work together as eu members , but we really needed an actual plan , not some kind `` relocate people to places they do n't want to be in , because it does n't give them sh * t ton of free money '' . 
  just need eu army asap and go full australian mode in mediterranean sea . 
   i 'd say that refugees refusing to be located in a certain country should be denied entry altogether , since they 're obviously not actual refugees . 
  that 's what we have been screaming through whole crisis . 
   after speaking with many of those involved and examining previously classified british and german documents in detail , spiegel has concluded ... no links to those documents or what so ever , writing absolute bull shit without a source . 
   however , the numerous agreements and treaties of the day contained not a single word about nato expansion in eastern europe . 
  good thing that even spiegel realized they were talking none-sense before this . 
   genscher remembered what had happened during the 1956 hungarian revolution . 
  some of the insurgents had announced their intention to join the western alliance , giving moscow the excuse to intervene militarily . 
  excuse to keep hungary occupied and complete work on destroying it 's economy , what great ally su is , not . 
  su an warsaw pact was forced `` alliance '' that only destroyed people lives , contrary to nato that maintained capitalism , democracy and peace making w. european countries sky rocket with their economy . 
  hold on , i need to call my cousin , he has insanely large collection of yu-gi-oh cards . 
  dbz or nothing . 
   hellsing i 'm not an anime fan , but i really liked this one and probably consider it my favorite anime . 
  because i saw it all on tv like 11 years ago when i was still a young pleb , it was first hook on anime , because of the gory and [ controversial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdj9i1jn5x4&amp;spfreload=10&amp;bpctr=1478971288 ) stuff .

  ever heard of thing called communism ? 
  we ca n't pull money out of our ass , it needs time to recover . 
  besides just because we 're behind w. european does n't really make us `` poor country '' . 
  it 's just a joke ukraine , please laugh comrade . 
  if were is one flag that unites us it is european union one . 
   meanwhile europe still has delusions of grandeur , is falling apart said since ... forever . 
   time to grow up europe . 
  that 's why majority of eu members are pushing for european army since long time ago , but uk was the one stalling it . 
  i love how 5 hours later he still have n't gave links . 
   yeah , promise , german foreign minister gave one to ussr about nato expansion , did n't hold for long , did it ? 
  because this is a myth . 
  no country in this age is `` independent '' , every country needs other country for economical reasons . 
  even after brexit , uk would need to find it 's way to new markets which would probably include european too ... this time with far shittier deals . 
  good for you malta , i 'm proud of you . 
  good ol' commie satelite states . 
  for some reason they also included us as having `` special status '' instead of being annexed . 
  ukraine is literally mentioned there as entity that should n't exist . 
  technically . 
  no shit . 
  actually people with low intellectual level leaves mostly , because you ca n't really live a full life here with low salary . 
   europe is n't a single country for time being . 
   america and russia 's sphere of influence needs to be pushed back because their interactions have brought us to this poin there no such a thing as russian sphere of influence , you can shove that up your ass if you really believe in it . 
  fascist russian baby eating baltics going to occupy moscow .

  we did n't participated in ww2 . 
  time for history lesson young kebap . 
  lithuania was neutral when ussr and nazi germany have invaded poland in 1939 's ( before that nazi germany already took from us [ klaip\u0117da region ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_german_ultimatum_to_lithuania ) with ultimatum ) , even though nazi germany offered us alliance and joint invasion to re-claim our lost capital - vilnius city , we refused ( even though we hated guts out of poland in interwar period ) and instead took their refugees and soldiers . 
  after soviet ultimatum we lost our independence de-facto to ussr , while our president fled to european countries to finally settle in usa . 
  first brutal soviet occupation made nazis be seen as liberators , but soon this thought faded away . 
  actually lithuanians were quite ... anti-semitic , because nazis used their propaganda that ussr is ran by jews and it 's jew fault that our people were brutally killed left and right , so in lithuania 95 % of jews were exterminated , while estonia was declared juden free ( free of jews ) since ussr already killed half of the jews there after first occupation . 
  the photo i gave is interwar lithuania , we were very pro german because north east prussia was place where [ lithuanian books ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) in latin script were n't banned , while meantime tsarist russia oppressed lithuanians , our language and our catholic faith , forcing rusification and orthodox faith . 
  plus germany was one of the biggest reasons why we won [ lithuanian-soviet war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) . 
  germany is [ our ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bubawwk.png ) senpai , not sauna loving russian killers . 
  why ? 
  [ mfw kebabs destroyed ancient civilization . 
  why ? 
  you do n't have any reason to have it . 
  shut up northern arabia . 
  [ true kebabs puttin ' themselves on spikes . 
  well that 's what australians are doing to keep their borders in check and it ... works . 
  yeah i guess , third reich proposed us alliance and joint attack on poland to re-claim vilnius - our capital , but we refused because we hated them since 1935 's when nazi lovers started to appear in klaip\u0117da region and 1939 when they took whole region from us , almost taking half of our economy down . 
  in history books and teacher i had treated it in neutral way . 
   because all lithuanians i happen to come across online treat this union like an act of aggresion against their independence made by polish folks . 
  vocal un-educated/trolling minority . 
  the same way poles have ultra-nationalists who claim commonwealth was pure polish empire . 
  that lithuanians are not lithuanians . 
  that central republic of lithuania - polish puppet state was last remiant of `` true lithuania '' what ever it means . 
  just absolute bullshit . 
   on the other side lithuanians learn that they were played by poland . 
  nope . 
  polish basis for nationalism is not being german . 
   that colour is gay though you 're gay . 
  :( that colour is cool af .
