   lithuanians can squirm and moan all they like , the reality is stalin did more to return the lands than any lithuanian in the past several centuries . 
  so now we should be grateful for getting butt raped by red army and nkvd units ? 
  and 50 years of miserable communism that greatly put us behind western europe ? 
  you can shove your sovietphile rhetoric up your ass , i 'm not buying it . 
  it 's you who believes that it 's rightful for poland to take territories but wrongful when it 's taken away . 
  so 1 % of population that borders poland is going to buy groceries there , cool story bro . 
  vilnius even after union was still part of grand duchy of lithuania . 
  if scotland breaks from the union with england , can now england claim glasgow or other surrounding areas ? 
  should france annex half of belgium or parts of switzerland ? 
  i understand that vilnius was full of poles and jews , but almost half of interwar poland was n't even ethnically polish either , so there is no excuse other than being dick to a country to used to ally yourself with . 
   your nation hate towards us is irrational child of russian propaganda from partitions . 
  that 's what you think . 
  your white washing of polish history is irrational . 
  `` muh poland did nothing wrong '' . 
  few people cross the border to save up few cents . 
  oh the horror , lithuania is literally mordor . 
  unlike poland , we gave germans big autonomy in memelland region . 
  very pro-lithuanian , so pro-lithuanian that he annexed lithuania into ussr . 
  just like crimea , territory transfer did n't matter because all of it was occupied by ussr either way . 
  i mean we gave great autonomy to germans in memelland . 
  if poland acted as friendly nation we would probably been belgium 2.0 hell maybe even switzerland 2.0, 
  i thought poland is sad that we 're distancing ourselves from you . 
  `` muh polish people need protection from those evil lithuanians . '', 
  there is no ethnic baltic , only balts ( which excludes estonians , because they 're finnic people ) . 
  baltic is a geographical term . 
   the baltics countries were allies to the germans ( which made sense , given the prior invasion by the su ) , so it only makes sense that the wehrmacht had n't committed atrocities there . 
  we were neutral before invasion by ussr ( 1940 ) . 
  german initial plan was actually to have lithuania as ally ( [ see first map of molotov -- ribbentrop pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov\u2013ribbentrop_pact#/media/file:ribbentrop-molotov.svg ) . 
  they proposed a joint attack on poland , for lithuania to re-claim vilnius region , but we refused it several times . 
  even though we were pro-german in interwar period , it changed after nazis came to power , since they took away `` memelland/klaip \u0117dos kra\u0161tas '' from us . 
  we did n't ally with neither , we just wanted to be left alone , but being sandwiched between two european superpowers , there was nothing but see what happens . 
  and no , after soviets killed half of estonian jews and other half was killed by nazis , estonia literally became juden free - free of jews . 
  while in lithuania like 95 % of jews were killed . 
  since soviets had most jews in it 's government and facing red army/nkvd brutality it was easy for nazis to push propaganda here . 
  either way if you were n't a jew or a slav , chances of survival were high for you ( being ethnically lithuanian/estonian/latvian ) in the baltics . 
  and germany was called third reich , your point ? 
  russia claims all the fruits made by ussr , but none of crimes . 
  hell they claim themselves to be legal successor of ussr . 
  also they still shelter criminals who ran over un-armed people with tanks in january events . 
  russia is legal successor of ussr , claiming all the glory but none of the crimes . 
  `` soviet '' is just a fancy name , whole country was built on russian imperialism . 
  for baltics , [ red army was far more inhuman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainiai_massacre ) than wehrmacht . 
  and they invaded us first and then re-occupied for another 50 years . 
  both are greatest evils in the history of humanity and should never ever exist again . 
  you mean icelanders ? 
  their language is the closest to alien . 
  historically vilnius was always part of lithuania , that still did n't stop poland from taking it just because . 
  likes of ? 
  god dammit poland and your satan 's latter . 
  yeah right . 
  that 's why we 're not part of eu , because we `` oppress '' our minorities , oh wait . 
  sweden , not finland . 
  in polish , lithuania is - litwa , while latvia is lotwa . 
  there is still huge difference between polish and russian/belarusian . 
  say to your fellow danes that we 're entering kalmar union and watch them jumping out of happiness . 
  it disagrees with everything that stops them from bullying . 
  not that you 're wrong , but it has something more to do with history . 
  [ [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_commonwealth ) ] ;[ [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) ] . 
  accept the power of the euro ' force . 
  claim your destiny . 
   removing polish language street signs where poles are the majority because this is total bs . 
  if i start put signs in africaan language would i not break law ? 
  [ besides honestly ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/55ryb6/deutsche_stra\u00dfe_sign_revealed_in_vilnius_during/d8dddhu ) . 
   changing people 's names on passports and ids [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm ) `` muh superior polish language must not be touched '' , your names are hard to write , let alone read and spell right . 
  plus they 're thinking on writing one in official country 's language and one in persons mother tongue . 
  again you 're blindly coming to the topic . 
   and basically a low-level attempt at trying to stifle polish-identity in lithuania . 
  basically a low level attempt to stirr shit up by pro-russian puppet waldemar tomaszewski . 
   to me it smells of paranoia about poles coming back in and polonizing the vilnius region . 
  are you joking ? 
   mistreat is a bit of a strong word for it . 
  it 's more like petty inconveniences like removing polish language street signs where poles are the majority and changing people 's names on passports and ids , and basically a low-level attempt at trying to stifle polish-identity in lithuania . 
  to me it smells of paranoia about poles coming back in and polonizing the vilnius region . 
  brain washed by it 's own media . 
  well unlike the countries you listed , [ baltics want to be similar to nordics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_council#members ) . 
  considering our common projects on economy , defence etc. 
   you know a nordic federation would n't just transfer scandinavian wealth to the baltic states but you do , all our top banks are nordic ones . 
  :p  would properly have a united foreign and defense policy sweden and finland should join nato and we pretty much filled . 
  :p  each country would still have a lot of autonomy within the union nobody said that we should create northern reich . 
  [ we kicked swedish ass , can we join too ? 
  :( ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ), 
  same , thought you guys wanted to federalise most . 
  well if you do n't know pros and cons of federalism best answer is `` do n't know '' . 
  really well made map and very informative , thank you . 
  italy wants bigger roman empire . 
  [ lithuanians be like - not making same mistake , fuck it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) . 
  accept euro lenkija , so we can into commonwealth again . 
  and how we mistreat them ? 
  those poles ca n't even speak proper polish though , they 're like mix of poles , lithuanians and russians with spicy belarusian in it . 
   concentration camps were far far worse than anything the soviets had . 
  you really think gulags were fancy and dandy to live in ? 
   even at their worst ` only ' 15 % of gulag prisoners died . 
  you do n't compare just gulags , soviets were rapists who liked to torture victims before executing them . 
  2 milion german women were raped after they pushed for berlin and soviet authority knew about it , but did jack sh * t to stop it because , surprise they did n't care , they 're animals not humans . 
   and then remind yourself that the nazis did all that in about a tenth of the time the soviets had . 
  that 's still not an excuse to call soviets `` good guys '' . 
   hell , if hitler had won most countries in eastern-europe would not exist anymore . 
  baltic states , belarus , ukraine , moldova ( romania minor ) were getting erased and replaced with russians and `` soviet '' life . 
  right before fall of ussr , latvia was minority in it 's nation . 
   their populations would 've been completely wiped out , and their lands resettled by german colonists .
