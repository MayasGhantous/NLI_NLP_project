  man you really need help , your schizophrenia is out of control , i think you might hurt your family . 
   you could n't even defeat the old prussians , we germans had to do that , you could n't handle a wild baltic tribe . 
  xd considering they invited to order to also deal with pagan lithuanians , since we were raiding their kingdom too , but to fucked poland up which forced them to ally with us to the point that our grand duke was king of poland . 
  so you gave up ? 
  you 're terrible troll mate , says everything about your level of your mentality , you 're just uneducated .

  these kind of videos are always made with mistakes . 
  straw man is strong with this one . 
  yes please , prove me wrong , show me that you are able to use facts instead of ass . 
  you still have n't gave me examples , you 're just talking out of your ass all the time . 
  what , asking for facts what makes us eastern european ? 
  have you ever thought that you might be schizophrenic ? 
  latvia is still the closest nation you could think of . 
  so you gave up ? 
  man you 're one terrible `` troll '' . 
  and as much west if not more west than finland . 
  then give me examples already . 
  the only thing you do n't fit with latvia is language , everything else pretty much identical , just like we are with poland or germany . 
   still does n't change that hungary is more distinctive with history , culture , genetics and linguistics . 
  baltics literally have 0 connection with russia when it comes to history , culture , genetic and linguistics . 
  again do a research before screaming how we 're eastern european . 
   yet they are fine with their shit but baltics are butthurt over still being in eastern europe . 
  show me hungarian who likes to be called eastern european . 
   so is hungary but you do n't see them insisting to be put in another category so they can be a special snowflake . 
  what it has to do with `` snowflake '' , it 's basic knowledge to use appropriate terms , unless you 're grandpa who forgot that east bloc does n't exist any more . 
   they have been under russian influence a long time and they are not in the northern nor central europe group . 
  man you 're uneducated . 
  name me connections that makes hungary or for that matter baltic states eastern . 
   it surely is about culture and estonia fits in the eastern europe box . 
  you really are uneducated in this matter . 
  all three baltic states are far more northern than denmark and far more western than finland , our geographical , linguistic , historical , cultural and political sides are definitely not in the east , if only people could first do some research about our small countries before claiming `` huehuehue you were occupied by russian empire and ussr huehuehue you 're east now huehuehue '' . 
  you do realize lithuania and poland are pretty much identical countries , same latvia and estonia are identical countries with germany , the only difference they all have is linguistic one . 
   think cia just proved that estonia is eastern european . 
  cia map is so cold war biased . 
  neither linguistically , nor culturally , nor politically , not even historically that map makes any sense . 
  please do a real research before claiming something like that , because you clearly have no idea on what are you talking about . 
   after the first world war the term `` baltic states '' was used to refer to countries by the baltic sea that had gained independence from russia in its aftermath . 
  as such it included not only former baltic governorates , but also latgale , lithuania and finland . 
  \u266a \u266a i 'm a judeo-christian morality with a greco-roman intellect it 's the way we 're short-wired it 's a civilising force that demands respect - from the baltic to the straits of gibraltar \u266a \u266a, 
  commonwealth stronk !, 
  estonians are closest to north-western russians ( which themselves mixed with finnic tribes ) , latvians and finns . 
  not germans/swedes/danes or actual russians .

  crimea is now part of mordor . 
  we do n't talk about it . 
  you mean ottoman 's europe ? 
  romania is not as big as france , which has several layers of countries between it and russia . 
  romania 's task is to protect the country by any means necessary , russians are historical enemies and they did n't change a bit through centuries . 
  romania is not usa 's puppet either , since they 're the ones that want usa 's help , not the other way around , usa is not pushing their troops here . 
  finland is not part of nato , but is part of eu , and scandinavian and baltic geopolitics includes stable and war-free finland . 
  we call you suomija . 
  pretty sure it will due to the same reason we would . 
  that 's not what it means in lithuanian . 
  there are several theories . 
  finland does n't need to become a nato ally , if it gets attacked we all go to war . 
  it was pyrrhic victory for the soviets , they tried to get whole country , but manage only to get their `` original demands '' . 
  finland 's brave men successfully defended it from becoming a commie shithole that rest of half of europe had to become under ussr claw . 
  but we have history with saxons . 
  yep . 
  back then shuffle and jumpstyle was popular in lithuania too . 
  because our most of politicians are still from soviets times . 
  because people who dislike gays are hardcore catholics who come from hardcore catholic family , like one of our seimas ' member - petras gra\u017eulis . 
  just like in russia , it 's mostly due to religion .

  which exactly what i said , nor lithuanians , nor belarusians , nor poles can claim gdl as their own . 
  and saying that lithuanians are not related to og lithuanians is total bullshit , who you think our ancestors are ? 
   after the union of horod\u0142o the lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with the polish szlachta , and over time began to become more and more polonized , although they did preserve their national consciousness , and in most cases recognition of their lithuanian family roots .

   bc of hte polish minority in lithuania . 
  stop talking non sense , thank you . 
  except , no . 
   but lithuanians claim otherwise , hence the problem . 
  the problem comes with people who compare medieval states with modern states . 
  the problem is same as with poles who claim adam mickiewicz as pole even though he did n't identified himself as one ( on note , he was n't lithuanian either ) , he 's one of the remnants of medieval identities that died out after final rise of nationalism .
