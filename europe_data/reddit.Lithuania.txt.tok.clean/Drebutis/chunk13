  edit1 :  and i would n't say they 're not related - they very much are , just not to the extend they think . 
  the extend you think that `` we think '' . 
  in our history books ruthenian influence on gdl is not denied . 
  [ please , stop talking non-sense . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png ) modern lithuania is the very same grand duchy of lithuania minus former conquered territories . 
  except it was not nation biased on ethnicity back then . 
  belarus and lithuania share hundreds of years of history and appointing gdl past to one or another is stupid thing to do . 
  i do n't understand where people get the idea that we take all the gdl pride to ourselves and leave nothing to belarus . 
  neither is ours , it 's polish . 
  you 're always welcome here . 
   now how do we ban abortion in latvia ? 
  make latvia full roman catholic extremist state ? 
  corruption and threats . 
  those slavers pay money to police and threaten family members and so on to keep their mouths shut . 
  your very own samogitians . 
  alien language , i tell you . 
  those are football fans , they 're the most retarded bunch of assholes . 
  [ like polish football fans .

  jesus , this is disturbing . 
  same . 
  everyone knows italy is land of the mafia . 
   osterreich what the hell , austria ? 
  what ever you say , thinking that russians are moldovans lol, 
   funnily enough it was mostly an anti-polish ban umm ... no . 
  only 1 out of 8 goals on russification was aimed specifically towards polish speakers . 
   * eliminate the polish language from public life  * prevent the employment of catholics in government institutions  * control and restrict the catholic church  * create favourable conditions for the spread of eastern orthodoxy  * replace lithuanian parish schools with russian grammar schools  * encourage ethnic russians to resettle in lithuanian lands  * replace the latin alphabet with the cyrillic alphabet  * ban any lithuanian-language publications in the latin alphabet -  considering that vilnius was essentially a polish city before stalin , same as with lviv . 
  a lot of people tend to forget that . 
  and ? 
  i do n't think any one forgets that poles once were majority in vilnius city , since it 's not surprising given our shared history for more than 500 years . 
  those are russian-moldovans , not ethnic moldovans ( romanians ) . 
  i do n't hate russians , i just hate the fact that they 're influencing lands they never belonged to begin with . 
  if they do n't want moldova to unite with romania ( even though moldovans are romanians ) they can go back to russia , that 's what i 'm saying . 
   hmm , i mistakenly attributed lithuanian statistics to the rest of the baltics . 
  protestantism probably had a hand in those literacy rates , which did n't apply to lithuania of course . 
  [ roman catholicism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) is the one of the reasons why our literacy was n't destroyed . 
  thing is while estonia and latvian were part of [ livonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/meyerbaltikum.jpg/800px-meyerbaltikum.jpg ) and had autonomy due to german ruling elite , lithuania was fully occupied into `` russian proper '' and everything that involved lithuanian nationhood was oppressed heavily ( e.g. 
  [ lithuanian press ban ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_press_ban ) by the tsarist regime , they even gave us a maniac as governor , who would be nick named , [ hangman of vilnius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky ) . 
  do n't compare apples to oranges , thank you . 
  went today to russian sub-reddit , there was a thread that was reaction to this thread on europe , as expected , tons of negativity , with insults , `` germans '' calling us dwarfs , leeches , parazites that should n't exist . 
  damn , what a sub-reddit you have there . 
  those are not moldovans , those are russian colonists brought in during ussr times . 
  victor writes history . 
  as some people , including me say , we wish germany ( central powers ) won the great war . 
  simple solution : move back to russia . 
  if only russia stopped funding it 's frozen conflicts and instead helped russian in foreign countries come back to russia . 
  that line exists for a reason . 
  that 's the point , if turkey is considered european , so is kazakhstan , which is laughable . 
  kazakhstan is also european too , did n't you know ? 
  : dddd, 
  same . 
  * lietuvininkai we 're are born . 
  lol, 
   because it turned into the pan german union yeah right ... 
  i think you overdose a bit with that glue . 
  during interwar period . 
  both ussr and russian empire occupied [ part ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bessarabia ) of romania . 
  yes we live in utopia , who needs army and military equipment , let alone commitments to nato alliance . 
  when something good happens about ussr ( e.g. 
  sending first man to space ) it 's russia . 
  when something bad happens about ussr ( e.g. 
  holodomor ) it 's soviets . 
   not the whole eatern block . 
  for example moldova has benefited a lot from being in the ussr ( especially 50s-70s ) and the country has been a wreck ever since because the people have terrible attitude . 
  because moldova before that was part of romania . 
  it 's a territory that was made into a country . 
  commies killed all our ( and other occupied countries ) intelligentsia . 
  [ you think they had brains ? 
  they helped to start revolution in russia to take it out of war . 
  [ they helped to prevent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) spread of commie ideology . 
   if germany had won the war , your country would probably not even exist . 
  [ german empire is the reason why our language survived , you know ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers#history ), 
  [ for lithuania it would been better . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_lithuania_ ( 1918 \\ ) ) german empire was the reason why we manage to get our independence . 
  [ no , we 're not . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/goo27w2.png )  lithuanians , like most other baltic/scandinavian cultures , have been known for being people of above average height . 
  at the end of the 19th century , the average height of males was 163.5 cm ( 5 ft 4 in ) and the average height of females was 153.3 cm ( 5 ft 0 in ) . 
  by the end of the 20th century , heights averaged 181.3 cm ( 5 ft 11 in ) for males and 167.5 cm ( 5 ft 6 in ) for females . 
  -  since the neolithic period the native inhabitants of the lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside , so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements , although without being actually isolated from them . 
  the lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous , without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups . 
  which is exactly what i said . 
  you 're correct , does n't mean you have to go ape shit when somebody disagrees . 
  i wonder when , and could you give me source ? 
  almost all of their population is in european part . 
  they have the man power and the resources , they just do n't know how to use them . 
  are you asking yourself ? 
  because you 're losing your mind over nothing . 
  word `` balt '' or lithuanian and latvian people is also quite young , it was coined somewhere in mid xix century . 
  even germans called themselves balts . 
  what you are is baltic finnic . 
  those who lived through soviet times and were brainwashed . 
  well balts ( baltas ( lt ) means white ) :p, 
  do n't worry we do n't . 
  oh yes , in russia [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_european_anti-communist_insurgencies ) did n't happen . 
  well ussr was built on blood , it had no way of surviving . 
  it 's actually western powers and usa 's aid that prevented downfall of ussr . 
  thank god they 're minority . 
  besides , please call yourself gudija , it sounds better and brings closer to us than to russians with belarus . 
  grand duchy of lietuva and gudija .
