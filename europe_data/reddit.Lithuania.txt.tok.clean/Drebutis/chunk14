  [ stay away from us , you the devil !!!!!, 
  we ... annex you ? 
  glorious gachimuchi . 
  sacrificing their gdp like an idiots , why do you think russians are poor af when they have biggest reserves of natural resources ? 
  they could be rich as norway in a blink of an eye . 
  technically we 're already are . 
  same currency , same foreign policy , open borders , etc. 
  1918 balt nationalists wetting their pants in their graves . 
  you were always baltic , lithuania contrary was not before end of ww1 . 
  the word itself stems from baltic sea , so stop being butthurt about it . 
  bring back the [ better flags ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f9cgdst.png ) oh , sorry , wrong one . 
  [ here it is !, 
  ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2785/4453887273_c39173169e_b.jpg ), 
  so white aliens ? 
  [ we northern now grandpa . 
  suck it russia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_europe#/media/file:languages_in_northern_europe.png ), 
  even in lithuanian it 's plural , shit . 
   seriously , what is wrong with you guys and such ridiculous accusations ? 
  some estonian inferiority complex is what 's wrong . 
  again , russian are free to get citizenship , all they have to do is learn basic estonian/latvian language and basic history of those two countries , then take test to prove it . 
  it 's 1 +1 . 
  there is no discrimination , only russian self denial . 
  they 're not second class citizens , they 're people who refuse to learn latvian/estonian language on basic level , basic history of host country . 
  they refuse to get themselves citizenship of estonia/latvia because grey passport also gives them visa-free movement to russia as it does to eu . 
  while taking out our manpower ... 
  russia is free to join nato . 
  period . 
  stop bullshiting with nato encirclement of russia . 
  [ russians are born to be gay . 
  i do n't understand why are they trying to deny it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7ej_ngqnrk ), 
  oh man , me too . 
  now i see why medvedev is his favorite toy , boy 's small and easily breakable . 
   the soviets were not russians , they were people of mixed nationality and generally despised the idea of a nationality . 
  yet westerners always refer to usa as russia . 
   also lithuania was a soviet ssr . 
  and the idea of soviet was to make an ethnically clean soviet republics to avoid tensions . 
  de facto one , but not de jure , we were occupied and occupied force created lssr after destroying republic of lithuania and exiling legitimate government . 
   all those russian `` autonomous republics '' in the middle of russia are a direct result of soviets who gave rights to the ethnic minorities in an exchange of loyality to soviet system . 
  yeah some minorities got rights , but millions of others died , soviet were great people after all !, 
  not . 
  no , before that it was [ full of ice . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/last_glacial_period#/media/file:iceageearth.jpg ), 
   expusled poles to ** make it more soviet ** and gave the poles all territories east of oder-niesse line as a reparation to the lost territories . 
  then they would have filled the void with russians and not lithuanians . 
  and before that it was swamp . 
   the origin of the name poland derives from a west slavic tribe of polans ( polanie ) that inhabited the warta river basin of the historic greater poland region in the 8th century . 
  the origin of the name polanie itself derives from the western slavic word pole ( field ) . 
  so what ? 
  there are many country names that mean something . 
  ukraine is not special case . 
  make intermarium great first !, 
  there were two mottos . 
   latin : ** si deus nobiscum quis contra nos ** ( * if god is with us , then who is against us * ) -  since the 18th century  latin : ** pro fide , lege et rege ** ( * for faith , law and king * ), 
   would look great being besieged by ~ ~ orcs ~ ~ creatures of the east . 
  unlike sweden or germany we do n't take muslims en masse . 
  not only vilnius , most of the country had heavy polish influence . 
  even today you can find names with suffix `` auskas '' ( i 'm one of them ) which is mutual with polish suffix `` ski '' , typical suffix for nobility . 
   little russia that 's tsarist term and it 's quite offensive one , it 's like calling koreans little chinese . 
  he 's a troll that probably pretends or is polish ultra-nationalist , do n't even bother . 
  expand , because from my point of view , nato is the reason why we 're not occupied by millennia long enemy . 
  nato is neither one nation , nor one army , it has a connected structure , but is has 28 armies . 
  european army would mean unified military force of european nations , one army , not 28 . 
  like grande arm\u00e9e during napoleon era . 
  yes , belarusians , ukrainians and russians were east slav people , but modern belarusians and ukrainians are not russians and russia itself is not kievan rus ' , but a part that was created from crumbled kievan rus ' . 
  muscovy was one of the stronger ex-rus ' states , so conquer the rest they had to make a legitimate claim on it ( e.g. 
  tsar started calling himself `` tsar of all rus ' '' and renaming g.d. of muscovites to tsardom of russia , so they could start expanding west . 
  besides belarusians lands were conquered from mongols and later connected through nobility marriage , lithuanian princes would convert to eastern orthodoxy to rule ruthenian lands . 
  european army is an old project , uk was the wall that held it , now that uk is out , yes , eu army is possible . 
  besides eu is not a one country , every sovereign european nation has it 's own foreign policy , only few have similar foreign policies . 
   some men just want to watch the world burn, 
  muscovites renamed themselves as russia to lay claim on ex-kievan rus ' land , to conquer it from lithuanians and poles . 
  clearly he wants nato to be out , so whole of europe would become playground for russia again . 
  long live nato alliance, 
  delusional , eu is the reason why our economy is recovering fast . 
  communism fucked our economy for 50 years . 
  to lay claim on muscovite imperialism . 
   like prussians , bavarians , ect ect ect were germans . 
  is it a hard to understand conception for you or what ? 
  prussians were balts . 
  german prussians are germans . 
  world 's vs russian perception on ukrainians . 
  like always . 
  because i do n't want to learn russian or french as my third language . 
  lithuanian language is archaic , while latvian language has a lot of influence from foreign languages e.g. 
  german . 
  russians were ruthenians , before kievan rus ' got split up . 
  belarus was called gudija ( and belarusians were gudai ) by lithuanians , and people of gudija itself after annexation into grand duchy of lithuania started to call themselves lithuanians , joining our nobility , before both lithuanian and ruthenian nobility became part of szlachta ( lithuanian : \u0161l\u0117kta ) within plc. 
  there is no difference between poland and lithuania , other than language too , we still have our own unique things like pagan festival - jonin\u0117s , dancing around bonfire as drunk people in middle of night . 
  as much as between spanish and protugese, 
   rus ' ( old russia ) rus ' = / = russia , it 's like saying roman empire is `` old italy '' . 
   the plc annexed ukraine and belarus where most of modern-day ukraine became part of poland and belarus became part of lithuania . 
  plc was created in 1569 , more than 300 years after fall of kievan rus ' . 
  and it 's [ grand duchy of lithuania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/goymd9a.png ) who had most of belarusian and ukrainian territory by the 1410 . 
   ukrainians and belarusians stopped considering themselves ethnic russians they never considered themselves ethnic russians , you 're mixing up rus ' / ruthenian with russian , two very different things . 
  why do you think they hold grey passports in estonia and latvia ? 
  they refuse to learn basic native language , they call you fascist for not speaking with them in russian . 
   lithuania have also not signed wtf ? 
  not surprised .
