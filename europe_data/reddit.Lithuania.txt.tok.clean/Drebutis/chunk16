  or just make unified army and make europe great again !, 
  explains your irrational hatred to germans . 
  [ this is how i see brexit . 
  ] ( http://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/a4jlwly_460sv.mp4 ), 
  such phantom threat , say that to moldova , georgia , ukraine etc. 
  [ lietuvininkai we 're are born . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_lithuanians ), 
  yes , africa definetly is doing very good with all those birth rates . 
  because you 're not lithuanian and you know jack shit about my country , so please stfu . 
  it 's rather how you see [ eu fund ads ] ( http://www.radviliskis.lt/radviliski/m/m_images/wfiles/iafjk77320.jpg ) on every corner . 
  my own gymnasium i finished was modernized insanely and improved because of eu funds . 
  comparing eu to ussr and their commie bloc is like comparing flowers and flamethrowers . 
  i 'm all in for [ mitteleuropa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitteleuropa ) . 
  you 're talking about one guy in forth person , why are you so against estonians ? 
  get them before russia does . 
  it 's easier to identify , nothing wrong with it . 
  might as well just use flair of your nationality or where ever fuck you live . 
  english jesus christ , i do n't know how can you go to army without knowing english . 
  that 's interesting . 
  what generic about it ? 
  you want your exclusive special breed european flag here ? 
  russians are insanely well integreted into lithuanian society , far more than poles and are in lithuanian military ranks with mutual respect to each other . 
  your soldiers are more than enough a detterent . 
  i 'm so sad that trump is going to get elected in the most times of need . 
   these countries have lost about 30-50 % which by no surprise were mostly russian colonizers send by ussr lol  not even the balts care about the baltic states so why would russia ? 
  go to russian sub , that 's where people like you gather to talk shit about baltics without knowing anything about us . 
  excatly , that 's why we need nato soldiers here , they are detterent from possible attack , look at georgia , ukraine , moldova , not being in nato is only asking to be occupied . 
  you know there is gold stars blue flag here that stand not only for european union but also for whole european continent . 
  adding more flags would be cool , i mean they could add polish-lithuanian commonwealth , austria-hungary etc. 
  to show european friendship and history between two . 
   because they are the people living in the ancient region of macedonia - what is so difficult to grasp here ? 
  why do you have such an angry opinion on this subject anyway ? 
  that 's the point ,   they 're not living in ancient macedonia < <  because they value his contribution ? 
  do n't you have statues to any foreigners in lithuania ? 
  do you even know who the hell he is ? 
  he has nothing to do with russians , now imagine that russian would start rising statues of him and calling him `` their '' philosopher , `` russian philosopher '' . 
  modern macedonians ( from fyrom ) neither are nor live in ancient macedonia . 
  they 're slavs who migrated there long after macedonia have fallen . 
   no , but do macedonians claim to be ancient macedonians ? 
  yes . 
  that 's why such irredentist concept is alive in fyrom , as '' [ united macedonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_macedonia ) '' . 
    the macedonian historians do not support the claim that today 's macedonians are `` slavs '' who came in the 6th century . 
  the latest book `` the descendants of alexander the great of macedon - the arguments and evidence that today 's macedonians are descendants of the ancient macedonians '' , puts an end to the `` slav '' claim . 
   i ca n't be doing that because you have n't explained what this concept of `` theft of history '' is about . 
  stealing a historical figure , state what ever ( e.g. 
  latvian claiming that grand duchy of lithuania belonged to them , all the historical figures were latvians ) . 
   just get out and admit your defeat !, 
  oh yeah , let fyrom nationalists slip away with their irredentism , i guess i can claim that estonia is actually a slavic nation all their historical figures were russians , lul . 
   how is this the same ? 
  do n't you teach about the history of the polish people , who lived in the wilno region of poland ? 
  poland/lithuania = / = slavic macedonia/hellenic macedonia . 
  unlike the latter two we were one nation and one people , our history is intertwined since union of kr\u0117vo , while slavic macedonians have 0 historical ties with ancient macedonian kingdom . 
  all they did is took the name while not being in the og territory of it . 
  it 's like belarus would rename itself poland and claimed every polish history and figure as their own . 
   which is called the region of macedonia . 
  which was not called macedonia before tito made it to be . 
   first of all , what the heck is `` claim '' in this context and what is wrong with them erecting statues to immanuel kant ? 
  for germans , it 's perfectly okay , for russians ? 
  what the fuck do russians have to do with immanuel kant to raise statues for him ? 
   you are making yourself a joke here . 
  it 's rather you who making a joke from yourself , since you 're defending history thieves . 
  what next you will defend estonian russian minority are actual true estonians ? 
  lol  and do the macedonians argue with that ? 
   can you explain what `` claim our history '' means ? 
  go read their history books and listen to their politicians or just look what statues they are [ raising ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_h2bxvih43tu/tqah6rcveqi/aaaaaaaaawo/ag2btziyvxq/s1600/dscf7392.jpg ) . 
  thracians had same god pantheon ( perk\u016bnas ( lt ) / perkon ( tr ) both similar to zues ( gr ) ) plus :  some authors like harvey mayer group thracian and dacian into a southern baltic linguistic family . 
  so , we were once your glorious neighbors . 
  shut up swamp germany . 
  at least plc manage to successfully conquer and occupy all of russia , unlike somebody . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a6u4rgb.jpg ) it has more to do with russian press ban and poland being in `` personal union '' with russian empire so they had cultural autonomy . 
   racial intermixing lithuanians genetically are closer to finns than poles . 
   700 years of one way slav-jewish migration gudai = white ruthenians and jews mixed , not ethnic lithuanians . 
  but ryga is lithuanian word for a city . 
  that 's why you use [ polish-lithuanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) and not polish , it 's like calling roman citizen italian , even though he comes from england . 
   when it comes to mickiewicz what he meant by lithuania was gdl , he was not a big fan of samogitia and samogitians , today lithuania and lithuanians . 
  he differed samogitians ( balts ) and lithuanians ( belarussians/poles ) . 
  holy fuck what an irredentist logic is that , modern lithuania = samogitia . 
  what are these poles smoking ? 
  turkic people and \u017de\u010dpospolita are [ buddies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars ) forever < 3, 
  there is no way that usa have a bases in stan - states , makes no sense . 
   they are n't taking ancient hellenic macedonia ... 
  but they have a right to talk about whatever used to be on the land they control now . 
  so i can now claim every estonian figure as my own , because we used to control souther tip of estonia , good to know . 
  they do n't even control macedonian kingdom , they control the outer territory that was connected to macedonian region when romans ruled the land . 
   plus there is no such legal `` right '' that you are talking about . 
  there is no such concept as `` theft of history '' in international law . 
  imagine if russia started to claim and raise statues of immanuel kant . 
  you practically making your nation a joke that needs to steal foreign national heroes to boost your nationalism . 
  it 's the same way that litvinists claim that mindaugas , vytautas , gedminas etc were belarusian and not lithuanians . 
  you do n't need law to be written when there are historian scientists or archaeologists that give you firm fact who/what was at that period given sources . 
  that way russia ca n't claim your history , poland ca n't claim german history . 
  can you get grip on this ? 
  we do n't love you , we do n't like . 
  if it was n't for russia , you would be our nr . 
  1 enemy . 
  we do n't want to be part of your shitty fantasies . 
  modern slavic macedonians literally have no right to ancient hellenic macedonia but are claiming that they do and you 're asking what is wrong with me ? 
  empire of poland ? 
  hope that does ' t include us . 
   `` this is our way of saying [ up yours ] to them , '' antonio milososki , the state 's former foreign minister , told the guardian in an interview in october 2010 .
