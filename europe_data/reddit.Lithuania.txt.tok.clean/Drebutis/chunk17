   `` alexander the great , in fact , had no passport or birth certificate , '' he said , sitting in the foyer of a government building brimming with relics dating back to the warrior king . 
  `` this project is about asserting macedonia 's identity at a time when it is under threat because of the name issue . 
  we all live in a geographic area where we share a common past but our attitude towards history is inclusive . 
  the greeks ' is exclusive . '', 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/14/alexander-great-macedonia-warrior-horse this is pretty much fyrom government in nutshell :   `` it is not only kitsch , it smacks of social engineering , '' says sasho ordanoski , a prominent political analyst . 
  `` what we are seeing is a typically populist regime building a nationalist superstate . 
  by trying to reform our ethnic identity , to say we are not slavs but hark back to an older age , they have resorted to a process of antiquitisation . '', 
  thank god ussr does n't exist any more . 
  only those who do n't have any education in anything so they have to take low wage jobs . 
  it was held by an army , not by the people . 
  gorbachev took away chains and everyone soon run away . 
  maybe because of this little [ guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_iii_of_russia ) ? 
   prussians were baltic people exterminated by the germans most of baltic prussians assimilated into either germans , poles or lithuanians . 
  60 % of german prussians had baltic ancestry even though speaking completely different language . 
  even after ~ 700 years , germans did n't forget their [ initial plan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruetmrjbkwi&amp;t=182s#t=1m48s ) . 
  go read what their politicians are claiming , next level bs . 
  both jogaila and pilsudski were lithuanians . 
  fyi,

  soviet army was deployed in lithuania , you moron , when russian started to roll over our people with tanks . 
  even today russia protects those people from prosecution . 
  [ elves master race ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/20/the-baltic-elves-taking-on-pro-russian-trolls.html ) . 
  well both are propaganda maps . 
  because unlike greeks and slavic macedonians , you 're one and same . 
   halva god , i miss these things . 
   nobody gives a shit , you can just say moldova the country and seal the deal . 
  moldova = / = fyrom on left side you have people who are ethnically and linguistically same people , on right side you have people who have literally 0 historical ties with ancient macedonia . 
  meh , brown bears sometimes come to lithuania through belarus , but unlikely , even then they look just big teddy bears that you want to hug . 
  that will completely bankrupt russia if they tried to built it through baltic sea . 
  happy b-day rumunija . 
  but [ wolves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_wolf_ ( character \\ ) ) and vampires ca n't live together . 
  did n't you watch the video ? 
  fyrom has alaxender the great statue , airports etc. 
  even though they have 0 history , 0 connections to it . 
   to say that `` slavic '' macedonian are claiming hellenic history and alexander the great is to say that ** `` germans ( not nazi ) builded death camps '' ** . 
  seriously . 
  which they did ... 
   but later , the country expands to include a ruthenian population several times larger than the lithuanian one . 
  so naturally the power shifts from from lithuanians to ruthenian culture , the ruthenian language even becomes official at one point . 
  you 're not wrong on ruthenians being majority of population but they never held real power , actually ruthenians joined lithuanian nobility , not other way around , but soon both ruthenians and lithuanians would become polonized either way . 
  ruthenian culture did n't influence much other than official language which was only used for documents in ruthenian speaking lands only , since we did n't had written form up until mid xvi c. when first lithuanian book was printed in latin . 
  if it makes no difference why are you so eager to hide criminal names ? 
  what 's so lol ? 
  can i claim your poets now ? 
  achieve nothing ? 
  or to show to world that soviets were n't liberators and were as much brutal animals as nazis . 
  shame listing them is more than enough . 
  so people would know which garbage in this world tortured their loved ones . 
  a random nkvd torturer is important to lithuanian and polish people , including other nations that were affected by nkvd murderous rampage . 
  so what that they 're dead , goebbels is also dead , should we forget his deranged propaganda was ? 
  so letting killers slip away is okay because else it might threaten their families ... 
  i do n't share your sympathy . 
  nkvd crimes are well known in both poland and lithuania , who commited them on other hand hardly , even today russia hides criminals who ran over people with tanks when january events ' took place in lithuania . 
  praising person they have no right to ? 
  it 's like irredentist belarusians better known as litvinists would now put statues of vytautas in middle of minsk and claiming as their leader that unified belarus . 
  because they 're murderous psychopaths . 
  you would be surprised . 
  no matter how you look fact stands , slavic macedonians have nothing to do with ancient ( hellenic ) macedonians . 
  to put it in history books that these guys were n't nice ? 
  maybe we should also forget stalin crimes or better , hitler 's , they 're dead after all so who cares . 
  building statues of alexander the great , naming airport etc after him , tell me more how is that not stealing history . 
  i have no problem with it , my problem is with them stealing history . 
  every single person in lithuania , including myself had family members tortured and out right slaughtered by these animals , what would you know . 
  greeks are far more closer to ancient macedonians than slavic `` macedonians '' will ever want to be . 
  slavs were n't near that region when alexander the great was alive . 
  yeah who cares , let the criminals slip away . 
   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included ** pyotr raslan ** , ** boris mironov ** , ** nachman dushanski ** , political leader of 8th border army ** mikhail kompanyanec ** , nkvd kretinga county deputy director ** yermolayev ** , nkvd lieutenant ** zhdanov ** and others . 
  well technically they are . 
  we have same issue with some belarusian irredentist that claim that they 're true lithuanians and steal everything from lithuanian history , the only thing is that they 're minority among other belarusians , but sadly very vocal one . 
  slavic macedonia claims hellenic ( greek history ) as their own , alexander 's empire as their own . 
  so they do n't recognize such thing as other macedonias because they 're `` true macedonia '' . 
  oh god . 
  old prussian language was very closely related to lithuanian one because both belong to baltic language branch so it was insanely easy for old prussians to assimilated to lithuanians , even then those lithuanians would soon find new identity - [ lietuvininkai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_lithuanians ) who were protestant lithuanians and not roman catholic lithuania proper . 
  german prussians had a lot of baltic loanwords in their vocabulary because ~ 60 % were ethnically og prussians who spoke northern german dialect . 
  the old prussian language was completely wiped by plagues and wars . 
  go and read about swedish `` deluge '' . 
  province named royal prussia lost 60 % of its population . 
  yeah i also knew about this , which is insane . 
  there is still a problem with slavic macedonian claiming hellenic history and alexander the great while building statues of him . 
  poland was part of [ baltic crusades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades ) ( aka northern crusades ) . 
   they ** eradicated ** the pagans from both modern day poland and lithuania they did not , og prussians assimilated into germans , poles and lithuanians . 
  [ to in 1260 . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png ) [ lithuanians language ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y5qt965.png ) in xvi c . after king mindaugas took the title of the king and lithuania was proclaimed kingdom , to did n't stop from raiding , attacking and from occupying samogitia ( lowland lithuania ) . 
  after death of mindaugas who had no sons to take the throne lithuania soon transformed into grand duchy again and all the nobles went back to paganism , centuries come , jogaila grand duke of lithuania would take polish throne and connect g. d. of lithuania and kingdom of poland with personal union , in return he also had to christianise lithuania , which he did , except samogitia which still centuries to come was most rebelling place which is why they had autonomy in both gdl and polish-lithuanian commonwealth , which is why even after centuries to come samogitian nobles would retain their pagan customs and refuse polish influence which unlike western lithuania was completely self polonized , history does n't end here as language switching , but i told you the key points . 
  to put into summary , pagans were n't eradicated , they either took new faith through polish missionaries or retained their customs . 
  even today pagan holidays like [ jonin\u0117s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_john%27s_eve ) exist . 
   i 've always though lithuanians beleived in slavic pantheon why the hell would balts believe in slavic pantheon when we have our own ? 
  just because you `` think '' does n't make it true . 
  which is why it will never work . 
  would end up in same place - shit above your head . 
  communism itself was one of the worst ideologies that brought only pain and suffering to this world . 
  did you really just tried to apologise their expansionist ambitions ? 
  holy moly . 
   i suppose , cooperation with russia to reduce tensions russia not occupying other sovereign nation 's land would be a good start to reduce tensions . 
  well too bad , you neither deserve one nor you can actually have one . 
   promise/pledge bla bla bla it 's irrelevant . 
   as for the agreement with gorbachev , no agreement was made specifically as to the expansion of nato , but us secretary of state  james baker stated publically , that this was the understanding , and the final agreement included promises not expand offensive forces in eastern europe . 
  i do n't care what he said , he 's irrelevant figure . 
  besides putin promised that he will not occupy crimea , look how that turned out .
