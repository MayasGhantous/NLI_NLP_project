   what is it if not an annexation , in the long-term ? 
  nato is not a country so how can it annex anything ? 
  sovereign nation has to apply for membership which takes years , and every single nato country has veto power to stop a sovereign nation on joining nato if they do n't want to . 
   kosovo , a part of serbia was made into semi-independent country , just like abkhazia or south ossetia . 
  yes kosovo also stands where the rest separatist republics are . 
  besides what it has to do with kosovo ? 
  part of it , not whole . 
  why would they want to join canada ? 
  that makes no sense . 
   they do n't seem to care . 
  which is a bad thing , they ai n't monaco . 
   2 week members . 
  being weak has nothing to do with it , setting up supply line is more than enough for usa colossal steam roll over russian cub . 
   for now . 
  not gon na happen . 
   why ? 
  considering how much free money they get from denmark . 
   the video did sort of imply it is already too late for us to catch up to russia . 
  usa lack of strategy ai n't the worst thing considering norway and denmark exist who are interested in arctic . 
   north pole is n't canada and north pole ai n't russia . 
   grenland is working for independance not that i oppose but would be a great mistake for them . 
   usa isnt all that interested in the artic . 
  for now . 
   only the week remaining . 
  again , usa will get involved if canada is threatened . 
   more information on official site of your ministry of defence . 
  alliance use your resources hence you pay not only for your own security , but to a common fund . 
  i do n't see where it 's written that alliance uses our resources when it 's directly aimed at our ** own ** ground , air or naval forces . 
   from times of georgian-abkhasian war your new friends : bombed yugoslavia and destroyed it invaded afghanistan -   `` the invasion was launched to capture ** osama bin laden ** , who was accused of the september 11 , 2001 attacks . 
  the us military forces did not capture him , though they toppled the taliban government and disrupted bin laden 's al-qaeda network . '', 
  this invasion did not target afghanistan or it 's people , usa did not annexed their territory . 
  -  invaded iraq til letting dictator to invade other countries is perfectly okay in russian eye , who would have thought . 
   invaded libya again , dictatorship which volatiles human rights is okay in russian eye . 
   your alliance made it . 
  why your alliance can do such things and we can not protect our interests and allies ? 
  because we do n't annex , or keep our troops on foreign soil after dictatorship or terrorist have been removed from power . 
  i think norway + denmark + canada + usa is more than enough leverage over csto . 
  and what makes you think like that ? 
  stupid sexy greeks . 
  thing is that one of the reasons why brexit happened is that turkey ( muslim nation with 80\u00a0000\u00a0000 people ) might become part of eu . 
   as you say , why is there all the hysteria about possible wars ? 
  because russia is a wild card with nukes , who keeps attacking new neighbours as time flows . 
   why do you pay your taxes to nato til we pay taxes to nato ... xd do you even have any idea what nato is ? 
   to protect you from whom , from north korea ? 
  from russia , who attacked georgia creating separatist republics ( abkhazia and south ossetia ) in it , keeping transnistria ( which is part of moldova ) occupied and now igniting and supporting `` rebels '' in e. ukraine while invading and occupying ( crimea ) part of sovereign nations territory , while meantime also bombing hospitals and civilians in syria which is a war crime . 
  let 's not even begin with our history with russia , only fool would trust that russia will not act as adversary . 
  because i 'm not laughing on russia but the fact you consider russia `` one of the most powerful countries '' . 
  it barely can hold it 's own turf and needs hard force to do so , which makes it insanely weak . 
  nukes and natural resources are what keep russia from falling apart . 
  well at least you can now [ sing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf-ilq1bcqa ) together with brits . 
   europe is a fucking continent . 
  hence why its called the european union . 
  what do you suggest they call it ? 
  cyprus is part of it . 
  so you lost the argument and you started to attack my country , very mature of you . 
  lithuania does n't pretend to be superpower , major power or even regional power . 
  besides life in lithuania is far better for average joe than that in russia . 
  [ not even close baby . 
   the leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world with economy size of spain . 
  they have been protecting [ war criminals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania \\ ) ) since fall of ussr . 
  we gon na get our hannibal lecter . 
  now i see how santa can live through centuries , he 's a vampire lord . 
  i mean for us summers are always warm . 
  you can find nice girls anywhere in europe , except england . 
  though canadian and european cities do n't look a like . 
  maybe because it 's least known place . 
  weather has nothing to do with it . 
  our summers are hot af . 
  why not ? 
  it 's not some kind of mordor . 
  it 's a paradise for a smoker . 
   for most europeans any place that is not italy/spain/france / germany , or their own country , is `` a strange place to visit '' . 
  exceptions are the obligatory one or two `` surprisingly nice '' eastern european cities . 
  nope . 
  people i know who travel on summer rather go to turkey , egypt or even thailand than to other european cities , they practically look a like . 
   legally , the personal union between brandenburg and prussia continued until the dissolution of the holy roman empire in 1806 . 
  however , by this time the emperor 's overlordship over the empire had become a legal fiction . 
  hence , after 1701 , brandenburg was de facto treated as part of the prussian kingdom . 
  because people think about modern core of germany , not historical . 
  well you can travel visa-free to eu states . 
  they 're suspicious of non ex-ussr countries , those who do n't speak belarusian/russian or those who do n't have any one to vouch for them . 
  belarus is known as last `` dictatorship '' of europe , so any potential opposition is great threat to regime . 
   belarus plans to introduce a visa-free regime with 80 countries in 2016 . 
  the visa-free regime will only apply to visitors arriving and departing from minsk international airport and visa-free entry will be only 5 days . 
  that 's why christianity has little to do in our politics , it 's the reason we 're more evolved than the rest of the world . 
   of course it was , but then again so was being `` french '' , `` german '' or especially `` lithuanian '' . 
  have i denied that ? 
  russia at that time was very francophil ` ish . 
   in polish language , `` rzeczpospolita '' ultimately ended up being a fancy word for ` republic ' used only in regards to polish state , while all the other republics are simply called `` republika '' . 
  does n't exclude the fact that plc was ours and your state . 
  calling it simply just poland is wrong , it was very multi-cultural state created by union of different realms . 
   it 's called `` poland '' by some western countries , besides being polish back then was different from being polish now . 
   rzeczpospolita means republic , not poland . 
  maybe in your polo, 
  let 's call uk just england . 
   actually many poles reffer polish-lithuanian commonwealth as poland so many poles just slept through history classes ? 
  good to know . 
  lithuania was never a vassal of poland . 
  down voting and not commenting pretty sure makes it look like kremlin pawns are doing their job . 
  it had nothing to do with the source itself .
