  plc was literally an empire if it was n't an elective monarchy . 
  you 're mixing things up . 
  [ mikhail muravyov-vilensky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky#northwestern_krai_governor_general ) , russian governor of former gdl parts of commonwealth , liked to hang people . 
  of course , any reason for su to invade finland again would have destroyed their economy the same way su did with rest of eastern europe . 
  as lithuanian ... ca n't argue with that . 
  i mean , we ourselves are not fans of commonwealth , you can guess why , but european federation is the future and starting to unite bit by bit is a way to go . 
  after su carved part of their country , while before that tried to fully occupy them , which forced them to ally with nazi germany instead of being neutral . 
  finland just got lucky after ww2 . 
  we need to re-create commonwealth , the only way we can become relevant and rich again . 
  4th dimension here i come . 
  leave it , the reason he mentions eu as some kind of new reich makes him an idiot . 
  yeah neutrality served baltics right too ? 
  why you 're ignoring things that happened before 1944 's ? 
  soviet union invaded neutral finland . 
  i 'm pretty sure you would still be a battle ground no matter what , we 're talking about russia , you know . 
  fact they still do n't . 
   anyway i hope that austria and other neutral countires will face the fact that neutrality does not realy exist and that military integration is the way to go . 
  we learned it the hard way in the 40 's . 
  russia is not the enemy , your imperialistic government is . 
  is it france or swamp german ? 
  got ta be on vampire side . 
  just use indo-european . 
  :\\ ^ ) lithuanians will get it . 
  because it involves only germanic/slavic/romance , fuck the celts , balts , greeks etc. 
  why would anyone sing in artificial language ? 
   i really , really , should have picked french instead . 
  as i guy who took french as second foreign language , please do n't . 
  after brexit , latin should become mandatory first foreign language . 
   \u00d6sterland the term is dead since xv century . 
  why the hell would you use it now ? 
  unlike you , i do n't stalk people . 
  no , they should not . 
  that still makes him lithuanian ... edit : besides , why do we talk about radziwill as one person , it was name of the family . 
  that does n't change the fact that you started to stalk me and nit pick arguments . 
  you 're talking absolute bs , imaging things we do n't say . 
  does n't matter , you proved my point , even now you started to stalk me through my comment history to nit pick things on which you could argue on . 
    probably because you like to attack on what ever little fact you can find, 
  you 're lost . 
  once . 
  not now . 
  excuse me ? 
  you truly lost . 
  pretty sure we were talking about pilsudski being dickhead to his neighbours . 
  just beg for unification . 
  not long you argued with me , picking up our nazi collaborators out of nowhere . 
  what ? 
  the deluge [ flash backs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ujfwo.gif ) coming up . 
  probably because you like to attack on what ever little fact you can find . 
  you had polish death camps . 
  celtic languages are weird af e.g. 
  you threatened me with knife after you took our child . 
  you over estimate our hatred for you for no reason , this ai n't interwar . 
  why would n't he ? 
  plc is huge subject . 
  ne , santa lives in lapland !, 
  just lock waldemar tomaszewski in basement and we 're set for second plc. 
  sad that bad blood started between us . 
  time to learn [ glorious languages ] ( http://prntscr.com/d3mp40 ) . 
  take me . 
  nobody can deny that you have coolest flag and welsh language is super cool too . 
  but i like greeks , you have similar names to ours . 
  wales are just brainwashed by englishmen , they were ruled for centuries by you !, 
  poor guys . 
   just look how big ~ ~ the federation ~ ~ forth reich is . 
  ftfy, 
  got ta learn how to be happy to not end up like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iob0vvf.png ) . 
  and russians can call lithuania [ northwestern krai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northwestern_krai#/media/file:mapa_6_gubernij_litwy_i_bialej_rusi_-_benedykt_hertz.jpg ) ... see how well that will go with public . 
   the name suomi ( finnish for `` finland '' ) has uncertain origins , but a candidate for a source is the proto-baltic word * \u017aem\u0113 , meaning `` land '' . 
  in addition to the close relatives of finnish ( the finnic languages ) , this name is also used in the baltic languages latvian and lithuanian . 
  stop pretending to be nordic and accept the baltic heritage . 
  make estii happy . 
  chill mate , it 's just a prank , bro , just a prank !, 
  wait what ? 
   what is it with this russian bogeyman everyone is afraid of ? 
  russia invaded and annexed sovereign country 's territory . 
  that 's more than enough to be afraid . 
  nato is not some kind military alliance that is going to invade half of the world or some kind of special rich country club . 
  it 's defensive alliance of collective nations that want to ensure peace is in their region . 
   in march 2009 , the russian envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , in response to rados\u0142aw sikorski \u2032 s proposal , while not ruling out nato membership at some point in the future , was quoted as saying : ** `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . 
  '' ** - ussr tried to join nato , but they had different ideology and [ illegally incorporated baltic states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states#list_of_recognition_and_non-recognition_of_annexation ) - us into their `` union '' . 
  you must be joking ? 
  sorry suomija , i heard enough from swedes that you 're eastern sweden that i start to actually believe it . 
   ukraine ** in ** poland . 
  he 's lithuanian who became king of poland , war with vytautas was because of dispute over who rules lithuania as grand duke , so i do n't think he felt more connected to poland . 
  pls senpai teach us your ways . 
  sure , sweety . 
  western swedes , eastern swedes , why do n't you guys unite into empire again ? 
  do n't forget to get personal union with hungary . 
  same with polish-lithuanian commonwealth and kievan rus ' . 
  i 'm apache helicopter who believes in spaghetti monster , you ca n't stop me !, 
  well religions [ people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romas_kalanta ) happened to be most rebel . 
  pretty sure it 's same everywhere . 
  it 's just cultural thing now . 
  you wanted us to show up ? 
   here i am . 
  regional power ? 
  once they 're threw from eu they will have no power on dividing it . 
  english is mandatory foreign language . 
   almost all have,
