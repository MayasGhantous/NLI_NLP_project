   are you that gullible when it comes to media ? 
  if i were i would be screaming how putin is great atm . 
  pretty sure france is known in europe as queen `` of not letting go '' . 
  kremlin boys trying hardest to down vote this . 
  that 's occupation not sphere of influence . 
  in your imagination . 
  russia threatens lithuanian sovereignty , i now declare russia our puppet state ... what a joke . 
   there are no true christians , jews or muslims in the world . 
  what ? 
  til pope is not a true christian . 
  strange , i think we also had like 1-2 classes per week , but the lesson mostly involved all the religions and differences between them instead of just focusing on catholicism etc. 
  nato primary task is not expand , it 's not a state , it 's an alliance of sovereign nations who want to ensure peace and stability in the region . 
  baltics sought peace and stability , they got one and now after being able to join nato it can ensure that that stability and peace will not be threatened by outside force . 
   nato can influence little countries in many ways to join . 
  russia does that nicely by itself . 
  there is no such a thing as sphere of influence . 
  neither russia nor usa are obligated to have one . 
  sovereign nations choose which they join or not join at all of any side . 
  austria was neutral during cold war , yet soviets had plans ready long ago on how to invade it . 
  shut up mr. sandman . 
  no , we need the bork banks . 
  sadly this is alternate universe . 
  erm , you got your ass kicked by russians , they took finland from you , eventually cutting your balls off just like germany got with prussia . 
  because we lost the brotherhood mojo after ww1 . 
  prussia without actual prussia . 
  please , no more . 
  does n't include area where prussia started either . 
  do n't mind him . 
  well it 's time for sweden to be called west finland . 
  ( \u0ca0_\u0ca0 ) my life choices suck . 
  little brother can into empire . 
  cold war ai n't over comrade eesti . 
  hope you did n't destroy us . 
  o.o you 're an ex - , not a brother . 
  sweden-lithuania !, 
  no personal space ... 
  the horror !, 
  lithuania just successfully [ back-stabbed poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) and run away with good looking sweden . 
  to protect ourselves from foreign forces . 
  why does n't usa unite with japan or korea ? 
  you got your answer . 
  [ well , he 's not wrong ... ] ( http://prntscr.com/d97th2 ), 
  not on [ our ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yodgg6z.png ) watch . 
  [ sweden-lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) or nothing !, 
  now count how many times you invaded other countries . 
   in 1610-1612 by poland and ~ ~ lithuania ~ ~ ( sic ! ) . 
  there were 0 lithuanian forces in moscow , learn your own history . 
  not at all . 
  after germany unified it sought stable borders , to end uprising or potential border changes . 
  was n't exactly liberation even after war has ended . 
  for that you need to somehow re-create commonwealth . 
  just stop talking , you 're making clown out of yourself . 
   bruxelles to control your country like how ? 
  not going to bother , reading your other comments gives me more than enough negative impression , no matter how many facts you are given you 're still shitting more of that crap . 
  much . 
  well china is rather ... hyper capitalistic nation rather than commie . 
  sadly you got commie government . 
  name things that makes us not sovereign . 
   [ nazi -- soviet economic relations ( 1934 -- 41 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi\u2013soviet_economic_relations_ ( 1934 -- 41 \\ ) ) -  but yeah , now you 're talking , i 'm starting to think that i ca n't really find one single positive effect the soviets has ever had on the world ... 
  they did , showed that communism is terrible ideology , because it leads easily to oppressive dictatorship government that kills it 's own people . 
   well , to be devil 's advocate , their technology is also pretty good since the soviets came into power . 
  they got technology from the germans . 
  when hitler 's nazi germany and stalin 's ussr were still a loose allies . 
  the only thing russia ever had and still has is man power , that 's all they ever had and have . 
  edit :  wwi russia was just a paper tiger pretty much , they invaded northern east prussia successfully but soon were [ crushed under german boot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruetmrjbkwi&amp; ) , but german leadership were smart enough to not push further . 
  the only forces they actually manage to reckon with were austrian ones . 
  being part of russian empire was probably the shittiest place you could be in . 
  russia through all it 's existence was always a backward state in europe . 
  hmm , maybe now ? 
  considering our population i do n't think we had ones back then , i think it 's a church . 
  ; o edit : [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1l4p34r.jpg ) is also un-edited photo , not sure why zepelin is not shown , maybe because of brightness . 
  at least [ we ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bubawwk.png ) can sympathize with our senpai like in good old times . 
  prussia is dead sadly . 
  what is left is artificial place with commie blocks and people who have nothing to do with prussia . 
  it was due to germany wanting the state to be dependant economically . 
  spare some memelland , please ? 
   that 's interesting , so who were the polish kings ? 
  jagiellon ( lithuanian ) dynasty after union of kr\u0117va / krewo ( 14 august 1385 ) , making personal union between grand duchy of lithuania and kingdom of poland , marking beginning of ever closer alliance . 
  up until second half of xvi century . 
  after that `` elective monarchy '' system has began in k. of poland so bunch of foreign kings appeared on the throne , like french , hungarian , swedish , lithuanian , german . 
   anyhow thanks for clarifying , not that well-informed about european history i am , but i 'm sure you get my point . 
  well i understand why . 
  chinese history is n't even a topic down here . 
  except sino-soviet split . 
  < . < ...  .  ... [ y-yes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/kingdomoflithuania1918map.png/800px-kingdomoflithuania1918map.png ) [ then again , it 's how it all began . 
  after personal union between poland and lithuania , most of the kings in poland and plc were n't even ethnically polish , does n't mean they 're not part of both polish and our history . 
   as belarussian or ruthenian . 
  belarusians together with ukrainians are ruthenians . 
  back then white ruthenians ( belarusians ) saw themselves as lithuanians . 
  how are we not part of western world ( nato , eu , eurozone , schengen , we completely align ourselves with western world like we always did ) ? 
  we have been part of west since our state was consolidating in xiii c. 
  [ poland-lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) intensifies . 
  even today `` papal bull '' that was given to mindaugas ii is legitimate , so inigo von urach ( grand son of mindaugas ii ) is actually eligible to claim lithuanian throne . 
   ferdinands hardly . 
  edit : hardly a playground considering our government at that time . 
  that video is well known . 
  russia just likes to talk random sh * t , because the more time passes the less relevant they become everyday . 
  russia did n't actually even exist back then . 
   united baltic duchy hope you know it does not include us into this `` state '' . 
  first step would be stopping on praising red army .
