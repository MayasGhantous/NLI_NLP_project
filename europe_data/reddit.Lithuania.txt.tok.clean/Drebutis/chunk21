    according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  not really hard to understand when you look at few main points . 
  german expansionism into baltics , russian white army wanting to re-create tsarist russia , fight against red army and bolshevism . 
   however , only a small portion of the freikorps in the baltic retired ; the rest stayed under the leadership of ** general r\u00fcdiger von der goltz ** . 
  to avoid casting blame on germany and infuriating the allies , he withdrew into the background and ** merged his troops with the `` special russian corps '' , led by cossack general pavel bermont-avalov ** . 
  the two generals recruited about 50,000 men : ** mostly freikorps , baltic germans ** , as well as some ** russian pows ** captured by germany in world war i and then ** released on the promise that they would help fight against the bolsheviks in the russian civil war ** . 
  the army declared that it joined the forces of aleksandr kolchak and marched to attack bolsheviks , but their real goal was to ** sustain german power in the baltic region ** . 
   why the hell did severyn nalyvaiko and bohdan khmelnytsky rebel , the latter even supporting the russian empire ? 
  because re promised to help them , instead they just annexed . 
  the cossack rebels main quest was to create polish-lithuanian-ruthenian commonwealth . 
   they did not speak the same language [ yes , they did . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/east_slavic_languages_tree_en.png/650px-east_slavic_languages_tree_en.png ), 
   `` besides ruthenians are ukrainians and belarusians '' such thing as belarusians or ukrainians never existed prior to rise of nationalism , plus both of them spoke same language at one point , while russia was already split from ruthenia long ago . 
   `` these people also accepted polish cultural dominance fyi '' -   still , the mostly cultural expansion of the polish influence continued since the ruthenian nobility were attracted by both the glamour of the western culture and the polish political order where the magnates became the unrestricted rulers of the lands and serfs in their vast estates . 
  whites also attacked us , pay reparations !, 
   in its beginning the declaration establishes several historical facts and on the basis of these facts concludes that the republic of latvia de jure is a sovereign country . 
  you do n't need a dead country to exist to proclaim yourself independent nation . 
   just because lithuanians flourished under the commonwealth we did not flourished . 
  you 're talking about things you know nothing about . 
   ruthenians , ukrainians and belorussians . 
  these people also accepted polish cultural dominance fyi . 
  besides ruthenians are ukrainians and belarusians , they 're not different ethnicity . 
  it meant higher prestige , the same way peter the great was huge francophile and wanted russia to speak french . 
  you 're comparing russian empire/ussr to that of [ polish-lithuanian commonwealth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_uprising#/media/file:rok_1863_polonia.jpg ) . 
  by the end of ww1 our bond with poland completely died out due to nationalism . 
  besides it 's poland who reacted to our polish school closure not the other way around . 
  consider the time it took place it was hardly accessible information . 
   polonization we accepted transition and drank some beer with lenkija . 
   russification you forced it down our throats while we bite your hand . 
  so what ? 
  back then nobody knew that communism is going to be the shittiest ideology of 20th century . 
  france was full of commies back then too . 
  caucasiod does n't really mean purely white . 
  happy independence day , mano broliuk . 
  russia should become part of mongol empire again , their independence was never recognized internationally . 
  besides russia already [ ceded ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/map_treaty_brest-litovsk.jpg/675px-map_treaty_brest-litovsk.jpg ) all the western territories to german empire who were going to create independent states ( e.g. 
  kingdom of lithuania , united baltic duchy - latvia , estonia ) . 
  it 's not wrong about poland or lithuania , we tried to get eastern latvia for ourselves . 
   in september 1919 , during attack against the soviets , lithuanian army occupied much of il\u016bkste municipality and threatened to take daugavpils as well . 
  between late august and early september , 1920 latvian army pushed lithuanians out . 
  lithuanians were weakened by \u017beligowski 's mutiny and did not escalate this confrontation . 
  on september 25 , 1920 latvia and lithuania agreed to seek international arbitration committee led by james young simpson to settle this dispute . 
  on march 1921 , lithuania was given port town palanga , village of \u0160ventoji , parts of rucava municipality and railroad junction of ma\u017eeikiai on r\u012bga - jelgava - liep\u0101ja railroad line , which meant that latvia had to build a new railway line . 
  latvia received town of akn\u012bste and some smaller territories in akn\u012bste municipality , ukri parish and bauska municipality . 
  latvia gave up 283,3 square km , while receiving 290 km2 . 
  about 16-20 000 ethnic latvians thus became lithuanian citizens . 
  -  as a result of polish -- soviet war , poland secured a 105 km long border with latvia . 
  in july 1919 poland announced annexation of all lands south of daugavpils and their inclusion in braslaw district . 
  latvia could not complain , as it still needed polish military help for the decisive battle of daugavpils against the soviets . 
  the issue was solved by renewed soviet attack against poland , and later , by polish-lithuanian conflict over vilnius . 
   after the october revolution , the bolsheviks took control of vladivostok and the trans-siberian railway in its entirety . 
  during the russian civil war they were overthrown by the ** white-allied ** czechoslovak legion , who declared the city to be an allied protectorate . 
  where do you see invasion if it was liberated by allies of whites ( tsarist russians ) ? 
  which states invaded russia ? 
  they supported russian tsarist government - the legitimate government , not the revolutionistic red scums . 
   and i am no sovietphile . 
  what kind of accusation was that ? 
  because i do n't see where west invaded russia in that link . 
   now they 'll need to convince the western public that it has no other choice than to go to war . 
  this is so ironic . 
  well , it 's easier for them since they speak one official language , we on other hand , united in diversity . 
  because they know jack shit about it . 
  pretty sure your people are already brainwashed . 
   our potential enemies ? 
  you found your problem . 
  living in a bs world . 
  russian empire was already crumbling back-ward oppressive state that should have died long ago . 
   he allies militarily backed the anti-bolshevik white forces in russia . 
  you call that western invasion ? 
  are you sovietphile ? 
  here i 'm sitting with a blanket covering myself . 
  damn you portugal . 
  captain afro-euroasia the super-continent !, 
  because they 're part of anti-western world . 
  most of them are just trolls/idiots . 
  because unlike russia who practices nuclear bombing on sweden , nato forces do joint training exercises together with non-nato sweden . 
   how did it come that nato violated more times than russia ? 
  denmark and norway are in nato , check how far away they are from sweden . 
  end of soviet occupation always makes me happy . 
  go scream that to putin . 
  for you . 
  yes !, 
   * soviet troops . 
  a union the baltic states joined . 
  and czechoslovakia joined third reich willingly . 
  fuck off you sovietphile scum . 
  i do n't see why not . 
  just buy them out . 
  pls help us annex belarus so you wo n't be alone any more . 
  a grand duchy ' bro . 
  could you tell , of course if you know , name of the soundtrack in the background that is playing ? 
  in the `` das boot '' `` not yet , kameraden , not yet ! '', 
  scene . 
  because it ensures that nobody is fucking with us when we have a sole superpower in this world on our side . 
  well after russian aggression in e. ukraine and crimea crisis , we started to boost our military so it would be above 2 % so we would n't be a free loaders like the rest of europe , so i 'm pretty sure trump is going to defend us . 
  ask germans to become a car park again , they surely like you . 
  even if nato happens to be ditched , i rather prefer american troops here than european ones . 
  why i find german language so sexy ? 
  i wish romania had power to annex you , look at their fighting over corruption , they would save you , poor lost brothers . 
   once you go red ... ... you always [ self immolate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romas_kalanta ) to escape the plague .
