  it 's all because of pierogi-cepelinai commonpot . 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 you 're not a real country, 
   doctors in eastern europe probably do n't care as much my doctor was forcing to go through all checks after he found out that last time i was checking my body health was 2-3 years ago . 
  which page ? 
  technicality . 
  show me those statistics . 
  it shows harbour and church , not the `` city '' itself . 
  well it looks like 1881 building in low density country . 
   the undeniable truth is that while most of us are aiming for a more unified europe , some people are trying to create new borders . 
  if only spain did n't ignore catalan wishes . 
  it 's old as hell i would assume , give it a break . 
  only litwa is worth of polish imperialism , sorry . 
  yeah , but polish-lithuanian relationship is far different today than it was during interwar period . 
  corruption . 
  i do n't think you can compare slavery ( use of forced labour ) to nazism ( extermination of everything that does n't fit in `` aryan race '' ) . 
  wait there are furries in lithuania , what the ... 
  i 'm talking about modern times . 
  it 's quite obivious that people will look at commonwealth as polish imperialism when poland was imperialistic during interwar period on trying to re-create polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  because it 's one giant beach . 
  probably because of catholic/protestant influence instead of eastern orthodox one . 
   maybe the answer lies in improving the image that is brought up when people think of eastern europe ? 
  easy to say when people generalize ee to russia who is historically known to be a shithole for common people . 
  we 're not mordor , m ` kay . 
  we would die , like lobsters we are . 
  now i see why i was literally roasting under the sun . 
  in layman 's terms : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanians#history, 
  before indo-europeans ( who would split and gradually transform into balts ) came region was covered by glacial ice cap ... do n't talk non sense , please . 
  it was still planned to ethnically cleanse the region and populated it with russians , it would be pain in the ass to have regions full of russians for such small nation like lithuania . 
  soviet russians , however you want to call them . 
  we were occupied by ussr . 
  true , but were are written sources . 
  * the nazis went so far as to suggest a german -- lithuanian military alliance against poland and promised to return the vilnius region , but lithuania held to its policy of strict neutrality . 
  * hey hitler , fuck neutrality and fuck allies , we will join the axis . 
  no potato in deprestuania . 
  well it 's a good thing , ethnic cleansing is never a good thing . 
  baltic countries is geographical concept , not [ ethnic one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) . 
  basically staying ignorant is a good thing in your opinion ... 
   their similar history what ? 
  there are inaccurate parts , so not the best way to learn belarusian history . 
  you insist that we should be for some god knows reason be called north eastern instead of northern even though we 're literally more in west than finland . 
  it 's mainly about usa , japanese and s. korean geopolitical goals goe toe-to-toe and both need usa for that . 
  adding the eastern part ? 
   to me baltic sea makes a really nice natural division and makes you north eastern , as said before . 
  and here you are creating sub-divisions yet again . 
  umm , you ca n't vassal us . 
  we shall revive jogaila for take over of polish throne , then revivle radvilas family for take over of polish nobility , convert all poles into pagans who will praise perk\u016bnas everyday , prepare for lithuanization ma\u017eas lenkiuk , prepare to become \u017daliukas . 
  rightful lithuanian clay . 
  very known , but yes . 
  it was mainly against eastern baltic pagan people and also against eastern orthodox . 
  estonians are not baltic people ... 
  baltic states were occupied by ussr and communism was purely enforced , after breaking away from commie claw it 's quite a deep scar to be reminded as `` post-soviet '' , `` post-communist '' state as we did n't wanted to be one to begin with . 
  \u0160\u0161\u0161\u0161 , tiny brazil . 
  gib ... north ? 
  i wonder if lssr leader could have succeeded like he did with vilnius . 
  to get an idea : [ lithuania minor ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/lithuania_minor.png ) . 
  i 'm not the one who downvoted , just for heads up . 
  ussr already had plenty of ice free harbours . 
  usa , japan , s. korea . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/589cgx/was_medieval_lithuania_actually_the_grand/ ) should explain more . 
  lssr was part of ussr , so nukes do n't matter when it comes to regions fate . 
  russia stands nowhere close to usa , let alone it posses not threat to europe , it can barely hold ground in far smaller and neighbouring states , and has to lie about their presence there . 
  if there is going to be new cold war it would be against west vs china . 
  it 's still a predecessor state to belarus , ukraine and russia , given those scandinavian rulers did n't held long and were assimilated into ruthenians . 
  same goes for lithuania and belarus and even ukraine , gdl was predecessor state to them because country itself was officially grand duchy of lithuania , ruthenia and samogitia , except people short the name as they do with commonwealth and simply call it poland . 
  iirc they wanted to , but our ussr assigned leader was fortunetly ethnically lithuanian and probably knew that region will be ethnically cleansed anything of german and especially prussian-lithuanian and that it will be colonised by russians . 
  besides vilnius region was also ethnically cleansed of polish by soviets , so he had a bigger job on making sure vilnius - historical capital of lithuania and now capital of lssr that even legal state of pre-ww2 republic of lithuania claimed would not be populated with russians creating same old story - country 's capital that has no native population left . 
  i meant kievan rus ' , when your people were still independent of foreign rule , but you 're right , looking in past as gdl as pure belarusian state , or pure lithuanian state is idiocy , same way like poles who look at polish-lithuanian commonwealth as pure polish state . 
  that 's the thing , ignorant people will say ignorant thing . 
   will match a ** cold war map ** . 
  here is the kicker . 
  those social thing will erase as time will go on any way , so quite irrelevant . 
  tl ; dr : [ baltic tribes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg/800px-baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg.png )  [ northern crusades ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png )  [ duchy of prussia ( german prussia , germans begin cultural assimilation of old prussians ( balts ) by the end of xviii c. old prussians language has died ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/rzeczpospolita_royal_ducal.png )  [ kingdom of prussia ( starts uniting germany ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/acprussiamap2.gif )  [ free state of prussia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/map-wr-prussia.svg/1024px-map-wr-prussia.svg.png )  [ end of prussia ( ussr craves prussia and incorporates it into communist poland and lithuanian/russian soviet socialist republics , while ethnically cleansing all region from any germans and colonising it with russians ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/east_prussia_1923-1939.png ), 
  except it would be relevant only during cold war , as far as i know cold war ended 27 years ago . 
  there are many geographical centres of europe . 
  yeah , except our has facts . 
   please , quote me where i insisted you should be called eastern europe . 
  * you 're not . 
  north-eastern at best since you do n't want to be eastern . 
  *  culturally you do share things with belarus but that 's beyond the point only [ small parts of it ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg/683px-grossgliederung_europas-en.svg.png ) share cultural heritage with lithuania . 
   geographical if we 're talking about geographical division here when we 're definitely northern european . 
  north eastern region is within all of russia . 
   i have no idea what you 're even talking about . 
  baltics is geographically ** north western ** and slovenia is geographically central or southern . 
  how is that a same group ? 
  what ? 
  i think you meant north eastern , even then there is no such cultural , geographical , let alone geopolitical sub-division as north eastern ... 
  of course we have nationalism else we would just ended up as another polish province with dying language . 
  when why animate it like that ? 
  it is still inaccurate . 
  i 'd say it 's retarded and falsifying history , which should n't suppose to be promoted . 
  wait what ? 
  belarusian tribes uniting and creating gdl , could someone explain ? 
  yeah , i agree , just gave the reasoning on why it might be this way . 
  genetics . 
  southern estonians and saaremaa still bears gene that was probably predominant of people that came with corded ware culture . 
  battle of orsha/battle of kirchholm ; *, 
  your comment implied that we should n't suppose to be called northern european , while insisting that we should be called eastern europe , so please . 
  if there is person who should read more , it 's you . 
   it 's pretty clear you want to be called northern because you have ill thoughts about eastern europe . 
  that ill thought is cultural , geographical and political .
