  we share neither with slovenia , so why should we both be in same group ? 
  * since the neolithic period the native inhabitants of the lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside , so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements , although without being actually isolated from them . 
  the lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous , without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups . 
  * i would assume same goes for latvia and estonia , excluding russian minority that was imported by ussr . 
  creating a common continental division that somehow fills your narrative that we 're eastern european nation . 
  the only sources i can find that give in-depth look of lithuanian history are actually in lithuanian language . 
  besides lithuanian history is too complicated to begin with . 
  i think you will have to do most of your research by yourself , though i can give some small facts . 
  lithuania only had one king - [ mindaugas ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/lt/7/7f/karalius_mindaugas.jpg ) that was baptised by livonian monks after [ battle of saule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_saule ) , which made livonian order weak , but we needed a way to deal with invading teutonic order in western lithuania , at that time kingdom of poland was still an enemy state of kingdom of lithuania because they 're the ones that invited order to deal with pagan old prussians ( balts ) that were raiding their christian land . 
  mindaugas soon converted back to paganism after to have n't stopped their attacks and especially due to him dying without heir , kingdom of lithuanian was once against grand duchy of lithuania , even though most future grand dukes of lithuania would call themselves as kings of lithuania , ruthenia and samogitia when writing to pope ... that 's just small part i can give , it would take forever to write everything that started to snowball from it . 
  -  any good media to watch you could watch simplified version of medieval lithuania 's border changes like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbpa4ilbjq8 ) one ( sadly it 's in lithuanian language ) , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phl-mbys2_e ) one is a bit more in-depth on border changes . 
  there is [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob-1vcmrucw ) of why battle of grunwald / \u017dalgiris / tannenberg ( 1410 ) was very important battle for polish , lithuanian and teutonic order 's ( soon to become duchy of prussia ) history in region , that would determine which state will be on top . 
  also would suggest reading about battle of blue waters ( which finalized our conquest of ex-kievan rus ' ) , battle of orsha ( insane early xvi c. battle against muscovy ) and battle of kirchholm ( one another victory against all odds battle of early xvii c. ) , lithuania has many battles from german order to mongols , to swedes , to russians , to turks and so on . 
  there are even trailers to promote 600th anniversary of the battle : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzaqxsya0uk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42davvcuojs i can also give you [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/gzqqpsriudq?t=64 ) of lithuanian armed forces during interwar period , fun fact we actually had more than enough of capability to stop advancing soviet forces , though only until they would get re-enforcements . 
  -  listen there is podcast about [ northern crusades ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbylxuzgci8 ) . 
   read you can either read [ books ] ( https://www.amazon.com/reconstruction-nations-ukraine-lithuania-1569-1999/dp/030010586x ) that include some parts of our history . 
  maybe start with wikipedia as it is easiest and shortest way to get glimpse of lithuanian history . 
  you could also check out [ lituanus ] ( http://www.lituanus.org/ ) ( lituanus is an english language journal dedicated to lithuanian and baltic art , history , language , literature and related cultural topics ) site . 
  and yet you 're doing it by calling us eastern europeans , n. eastern europeans , how ironic . 
  northern europe is a geographical concept , which is why baltics are part of it . 
  nordic is cultural concept , scandinavian is ethnic concept , how is so hard for you to understand ? 
  after all greatest polish leaders were in fact lithuanians who spoke polish . 
  pure as in european . 
  yes , indeed it looks beutiful . 
  ^ gib ^ ^ throne, 
  it 's baltic languages in nutshell , we have - as suffixes . 
  but you call lithuania - ice cream . 
  you do n't understand concept of northern european , do you ? 
  it has nothing to do with nordics or scandinavia . 
   i understand estonia claiming to be one a bit , but lithuania and latvia ? 
  nope . 
  again you 're thinking about nordics , not northern european concept . 
  you can deny as much as you want , wo n't change the fact that we 're counted as one now . 
   and yet that did n't happen for over 4 centuries . 
  explain how they were gon na make poland a vassal in 1500s when we were much stronger than 1-2 centuries before that ? 
  when muscovy takes down lithuania , guess who is going to be their next target ? 
   so tell me why did we have a union then ? 
  i did n't deny the fact why we had union with you ... 
  i just pointed out that union was mutual for self preservation . 
  * sigismund ii augustus , king of poland and grand duke of lithuania , seeing the threat to lithuania and eventually to poland , pressed for the union , gradually gaining more followers until he felt enough support to forcibly evict landowners who opposed transition of territory from lithuania to poland . 
  call finnic a russian and watch him go full talvisota . 
  which makes sense . 
  one more reason for baltic federation !, 
   so why would they then ? 
  because since xi c. hre wanted k. of poland to become vassal . 
   i recommend you read up on that . 
  dude i know my own history ...  kinda salty about lwow and wilno unlike lwow , poland never held vilnius prior to 1923 , let alone poles started to settle the land after partitions when russification began and lithuanian language books and latin latter were prohibited . 
  so poles were present in vilnius region only for about ~ 100 years, 
  yes we are . 
  the great and only - google . 
  i 'd assume during northern crusades . 
   poland nor lithuania are legal successors of plc. 
  and you 're biasing this on what ? 
  when people talk about american civil war , i 'm like , [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_civil_war ) shit used to be everyday boy . 
  same goes for poland becoming part of hre province . 
  no , i 'm going to party with lthuania . 
  * one country only translate my license !, 
  lithuanian basis will please sell and all garlic butters ( whether or white , while complete lines ) !, 
  which is why we should educate people before their own ignorance succumbs them . 
  it 's geopolitics , even then we 're geographically northern whether you like it or not . 
  * true communism was never implement * oh fuck off . 
  no we should n't take this , by wanting to reach western european level of wealth we have to beat corruption and these assholes to the ground , it 's motivator for better life , why do you think we look at nordics and germany as * country model \u2122 * instead of let 's say russia ? 
  they 're success stories , we already had fetish for germany and nordics during interwar period . 
  but usa , with canada , australia are our successful colonies . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_europe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic-baltic_eight https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_council#members https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_investment_bank#/media/file:nibmembers.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_battlegroup we 're more and more integrated with northern countries as years pass , i do n't see a reason why we should n't be considered northern countries given our geopolitics . 
  you forgot the [ muslim nazis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awf3qrk3auu ) . 
  clearly you meant to say [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qls6imp.jpg ) . 
  glorious [ couronian colonization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/couronian_colonization ) , time to reclaim our place under the eternal sun . 
  [ not for you to decide . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ), 
  baltics are culturally closer to germany and poland than they are to nordics or eastern europe ( russia , ukraine , belarus ) . 
   understand yet ? 
  i do n't understand your hardcore defence on / r/latestagecapitalism, 
   also not defending socialism . 
  also not a socialist either ( still ) . 
  keep up bud . 
  -   as a guy from a state founded by socialists , fuck yourself right back  - / u/poxbottled24 yet you 're proud of your state being founded by socialists . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6sjvxt/british_textile_company_owner_addressing_romanian/dldi2b4/ if this is not defending communism then i do n't know . 
  i do n't know , you sound like a guy who defends communism . 
  i 'm in favour of improving capitalism or replacing it with better system , as long as it is not communism , because we have experience with communism . 
  socialism is not same as full blown communism that fucked over my country and family . 
  hey , unlike you americans , europeans know how imperialism work . 
  only europeans manage to enslave other europeans . 
  my comment implied contrary . 
  risky click of the day, 
  compare to communism ? 
  yes . 
  as a guy from ex-commie state , sincerely , go fuck yourself . 
   it 's just a reminder that even in europe the most enlightened continent it still works the same way . 
  mostly in eastern part of europe , due to enforced communism by ussr we have to suffer the catch up to west game . 
  got paid in shadow money . 
  you have legal stance on firing that kind of people . 
  so you should get to their level ? 
  even then , if they 're doing their job wrong or are harassing somebody , well you lose the job fast . 
  yes , all federalists are neo-nazis who dream about fourth reich ... stop talking non sense , thank you . 
   ( probably only because they were already taken over by them ) . 
  iirc is mostly due to them being pain in the ass as pagan rebels . 
  we would be part of [ baltoscandian confederation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ) , not nordic union . 
  i 'll go full tom of finland for that . 
  jogaila was the government .
