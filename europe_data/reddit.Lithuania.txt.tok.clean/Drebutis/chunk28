  they had to obey higher commands orders without a second thought . 
  many waffen ss division believed in different ideologies . 
  like baltic waffen-ss ( latvian and estonian legions ) believed in fight against bolshevism , not `` arayan race purity '' , which is why they were spared from prosecution . 
   in 1946 , the nuremberg tribunal declared the waffen-ss to be a criminal organization , making an exception of people who had been forcibly conscripted . 
  ** throughout the post-war years , the allies would apply this exception to the soldiers of the latvian legion and the estonian legion ** . 
  the us displaced persons commission in september 1950 declared that :  `` the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore ** the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states ** . '', 
  first soviet occupation was more than enough to make nazis look like liberators during operation barbarossa :  oberf\u00fchrer adolf ax , commander of the 15th division , reported on 27 january 1945 : '' ** they are first and foremost latvians . 
  they want a sustainable latvian nation state . 
  forced to choose between germany and russia , they have chosen germany , because they seek co-operation with western civilization . 
  the rule of the germans seems to them to be the lesser of two evils . 
  ** '' this perspective resulted in part from ** the soviet occupation between 1940 and 1941 ** , called `` the year of terror '' ( latvian : baigais gads ) during which ** tens of thousands of latvian families were executed or deported to siberia ** with men separated from the women and children to break down resistance, 
  people who belonged to nazi party were nazis . 
  ussr started war together with nazi germany . 
  one of the reasons why nazis got support from such states as lithuania was because we hated soviets more than anybody else and that took only one year of their brutal regime . 
  not every german was nazi . 
  nazism is ideology not ethnicity . 
  there were slavs even jews within waffen ss . 
  you began the mocking and got triggered after receiving same . 
  turkey was shitting it 's pants during ww2 . 
  thanking god that nazi germany were pre-occupied with more important matters . 
  even today , the actual national socialists not neo-nazis ( neo-nazis are the shittiest form of national socialism , most of them would be purged by ns ) , consider turks to be next to a roach . 
  germany 's gdp is $ 3.371 trillion while turkey 's is only $ 861 billion . 
  he 's right , even with limited fund german tanks are one of the best in the world . 
  if germany was serious about it 's military might you would most likely shit your pants before you would cross greece 's airspace . 
  nazi collaborationism involve 30 different countries . 
  so much bullshit , we know you 're butthurt , but jesus . 
  instead of attacking usa ( brining usa to war ) , japs could have taken undefended soviet east . 
   hitler did n't kill a single jew . 
  ~ ~ germans ~ ~ collaborationists did . 
  germany did not start ww1 ... 
   constantly seeking for ways to ** reduce ** russian gas amount in lithuanian market . 
   eu army wo n't happen because every nation in europe keeps their defense spending and capabilities very low , and they are happy that way . 
  that makes no sense . 
  eu army have n't happen because some member states blocked it ( choo choo uk ) , even then unlike usa , eu is not a single sovereign country , eu would need to federalise before eu army can happen . 
  and ns2 and especially migrant quotas are what makes people eurosceptic . 
  that 's what you understood , not what i meant . 
  i never said you were weak , i said eu is great benefactor of your success as economical power . 
  fresh baked troll acc , welcome to reddit , may the force of trolling be with you, 
   but germany leads the eu anyway . 
  they 're not leading eu ... wtf lol,

  that depends on a name . 
  but in most cases yes . 
   yes because splitting up nations worked so well in the balkans and the middle east .

  average wage in ukraine - $ 180 vs lithuania/latvia - $ 645 and estonia with $ 958 . 
  estonia already bypassed portugal , good for them . 
  still mind boggling why ca n't we catch them up . 
  guess that nordic meme is not a meme for them . 
  our people are very pro-european , what 's so surprising ?

  after reading pr\u00fcm convention , i 'm not so sure why we 're not part of it . 
   scottish accent at times ( why does no one understand girl ?!! ) . 
  well , because of media and audio influence which contains mostly american accent . 
  living in a capital city is usually more expensive due to it being well capital city , than any other major city . 
  especially tourist places are more expensive than the rest of the city . 
  do n't worry , i was n't serious about it . 
  i 'm always with clothes when i go against sun . 
  oh my ... how could not think of the children ? 
  sometimes lithuania is a good place to live , we get to experience everything ... can someone tell me what are mountains ? 
  summer can get at max to 37 c , winters can get to at max -42 c , 21 c is tolerable . 
  when it 's summer i wish it was winter , when it 's winter i wish it was summer , rarely you get to enjoy not to hot , not to cold weather . 
   must feel like being in an oven if you 're inland . 
  went out side , saw my lobster skin , went back inside . 
  21 is like hot here . 
  yeah right sc is peasant tier game . 
   today , what is its purpose ? 
  safety of regions ? 
  which russia loves to destabilize like in ukraine , georgia and moldova . 
   haha , i know that very well . 
  and i heard how proud many of you are still about their history in the ss : https://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article138524321/viele-letten-sind-stolz-auf-die-ss-dank-putin.html just assumed that you 've actually learned something from that . 
  but i guess being called `` asshole '' for remembering you about a very dark part of our common history , says it all . 
  waffen ss unit was never formed in lithuania , germans tried but lithuanians went rogue on them so they had to disperse it . 
  besides you 're very uneducated in this matter i assume .
