  considering gdl yes . 
  modern lithuania , definitely not . 
  your nobles did pursue as much influence as possible . 
  gymnasium i went offered russian , french and german , i think that 's the best way to teach kids , since it gives choices from all main language groups . 
  it feels like we 're mix of everything ... 
  but you survived broliukas < 3 rip old prussians xviii c. 
  i 'm not denying it , actually i 'm embracing it as mistakes . 
  yes , so what ? 
  most of monarchs who sat on thrones in europe before ww1 were german descendent . 
  it 's not shitting on poland , it 's just a fact . 
  like any other nation , polish cultural and lingual life was far more influential than anyone else in commonwealth . 
  the same way we have to use english today , it influenced most nations . 
  where is the answer ? 
   technological advancements ( better military tech making the current military stronger ) aswell as the new way of fighting wars ( cyber war and information war ) all of this is natural process , hardly an achievement . 
  let alone ussr 's military capability was far stronger at that time ( if not nukes they could have easily invaded whole of europe without much resistance , while modern russia can only grab one and other small land and suffer economically ) , ussr 's technological advance also was sky rocketed ( pun intended ) unlike russia 's who are behind , because just like late ussr they put too much money in military . 
   the fact that russia didnt lost its status are all counters to that . 
  it 's far easier to maintain regional power status than superpower . 
   radziwi\u0142\u0142 's which one ? 
  besides he was n't polish or lithuanian , he was polish-lithuanian in non-modern sense , equally to that of british . 
  military power , economic power , influential power ( superpower status ) , russia is nowhere near that of ussr . 
  lol, 
  you , not us . 
  ukraine at that time was n't part of grand duchy ' any more so our laws did n't apply to them , your laws started to apply to them . 
  russia is far from being stronger than ussr was . 
  it 's laughable to compare ussr and russia . 
  - kauno ' process made huge anti-lithuanian mood in germany . 
  - a. hitler started to threaten lithuanian government , imposed `` sactions '' and started to mobilize military army near east prussian border . 
  russia takes ukrainian clay and laugh in the face . 
  it 's just humour , comrade . 
  what about period of fragmentation and teutonic order threat ? 
  you probably do n't know but we were first nation prosecute nazis and their ideology which led to imprisonment of them . 
  no , you 're right . 
  wiki pretty much describes it perfectly : * [ ethnographic regions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regions_of_lithuania#/media/file:etnoregionai.png ) , i 'd like to note that lithuania minor was mixed between lithuanian and german , not russian ( for those who do n't know region 's history ) . 
  * the lithuanian language has two dialects ( tarm\u0117s ) : ** auk\u0161tai\u010di\u0173 ** ( auk\u0161taitian , highland lithuanian ) and ** \u017demai\u010di\u0173 / \u017demaitiu ** ( samogitian , lowland lithuanian ) . 
  there are significant differences between standard lithuanian and samogitian . 
  the modern samogitian dialect formed in the 13th -- 16th centuries under the influence of the curonian language . 
  lithuanian dialects are closely connected with ethnographical regions of lithuania . 
  dialects are divided into subdialects ( patarm\u0117s ) . 
  both dialects have three subdialects . 
  ** samogitian ** is divided into west , north and south ; ** auk\u0161taitian ** into west ( suvalkie\u010diai ) , south ( dz\u016bkai ) and east . 
  each subdialect is divided into smaller units -- speeches ( \u0161nektos ) . 
  standard lithuanian is derived mostly from western auk\u0161taitian dialects , including the eastern dialect of lithuania minor . 
  influence of other dialects is more significant in the vocabulary of standard lithuanian . 
  lithuanian and polish history are full roller coasters . 
  england was already unified when norman conquest happened . 
  mainly normans , who conquered england . 
   roman military withdrawals left britain open to invasion by pagan , seafaring warriors from north-western continental europe , chiefly the angles , saxons and jutes who had long raided the coasts of the roman province and began to settle , initially in the eastern part of the country . 
  well , guess who did n't let moscow grow , we . 
  putting less attention by kingdom of poland on east is what caused moscow to grow out of size . 
  man you 're delusional . 
  electing king in age of monarchy . 
  third battle of narva inc. / s, 
  well , what can i say , your system sucks lenkija . 
   i recommend the world war one videos . 
  for those who want more on depth on ww1 check ** thegreatwar ** yt channel . 
  true , that 's the reason why khmelnytsky uprising happened , poles loved to impose their language , culture , religion . 
  [ dw , we got them fam . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_kazimierz_sapieha_the_younger ), 
  switzerland ? 
  o.o but yeah . 
  even lithuania at it 's golden age tried to expand as much as it could , but were different than other empires , we did n't impose our language , laws or catholic religion . 
  modern european countries put their imperialistic ambitions long ago , for the better future , who unlike russia , loves to be back-ward country . 
  well they were the invaders to scots at first . 
  pretty much every country in europe has same history as russia - defending against foreign forces , almost all have similar geographic position , russia is no way special and history in no way is excuse for their non-stop imperialistic ambitions . 
  i do n't know what you mean by that but from which asylum have you escaped ? 
  like everywhere else , no surprise . 
  i never said they were saint , i said that they did n't rule occupied lithuania under nazis . 
  speak for yourself , cunt . 
  google our continents history . 
  dw about him , we love you amerika < 3, 
   lietuvos aktyvist\u0173 frontas -   the government self-disbanded and laf was banned by nazi authorities in september 1941   the german authorities did not use brutal force against its members . 
  rather , they established their own administrative structures ( reichskommissariat ostland ) and slowly deprived the government of its powers . 
  the government lost all of its power in a few weeks , and seeing no more reason to continue work , dissolved itself in august 1941 . 
  laf as an organization remained . 
  in september it sent a memorandum to germany protesting against the occupation of lithuania . 
  in response , the lithuanian activist front was banned on september 26 ; many of its leaders were arrested and sent to concentration camps . 
  questionable . 
  given the time line doubtful . 
   so it was our fault ? 
  and do n't even try to justify it . 
  have i even tried , god you 're paranoid . 
   they all wanted jewish properties , wealth and so on oh god , source ? 
   central governement , local governement , church and other institutions did not support these methods . 
  we were under nazi german occupation , none of this sh * t existed under them . 
   lol germans even import jews to lithuania because you were so good at killing them source ? 
   lithuanian troops were send to eastern poland , wilno for example , to kill jews there . 
  you joking right ? 
   it was the same bullshit like in volhynia and galicia , where ukrainians had killed jews first than started to kill polish people . 
  that 's ukrainian matter , not our , i do n't give a shit what they done in valhynia and galicia . 
  the state was occupied by nazi germany they were seen as liberators , anti-jewish sentiment grew insanely after first occupation by ussr , anti-polish sentiment was already strong after polish take over of vilnius . 
  your government after pilsudski 's death was really push over on it too . 
  it 's sure shame in our history books , but you have to take into account what forced it to begin with . 
  there is a reason we also have word for these people \u017eyd\u0161aud\u017eiai ( one that shoots jews ) . 
   was a lithuanian killing squad of approximately 50 men oh my god , whole lithuanian nation is nazi !!, 
  i never denied that to begin with , good that you finally agree . 
  make what ever excuses you want , you did the land grab . 
  land grabbing . 
  now , not in interwar period . 
  yes , because that meant exploiting others . 
  we already have snow here in north central lithuania .
