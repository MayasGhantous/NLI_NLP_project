  bigger problem is with brussels than germany itself . 
   you 're asking who asked us to let you in ? 
  you did . 
  that 's not a counter argument . 
  we improved our countries to all requirements , nobody blocked the decision . 
  taking refugee quota is not requirement of being part of eu last i remember . 
   and you fail to answer my main argument : sometimes you need to take risks for the greater good it produces . 
  i see no greater good in taking mena people , other than endangering citizens . 
  these are not highly educated people , none of them want to live in ee to begin with . 
   do you think syrian people deserve no help at all ? 
  they do . 
  but narrowing on just syrians is stupid , [ most refugees are from mena countries and other european nations ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/map_of_the_european_migrant_crisis_2015.png/800px-map_of_the_european_migrant_crisis_2015.png ) , not syria . 
  you do n't say . 
  why do you think so many mena people are so keen to bypass dozen countries just to enter germany ? 
  2/3 of refugees in lithuania already went to germany . 
  they wo n't stay here if you will not give them everything for free . 
  nobody forced you to do this , nobody asked you to do this ? 
  yet we 're enforced to take something that western countries brought by themselves , instead of spewing same old bullshit of us being racist , maybe time to start controlling your external borders ? 
  european in other european nation will integrate faster than any mena people will . 
  for european switching language already will make you look look like a native . 
   how would you feel if people started to demand we take back your freedom of movement , because someone who talks your language did something stupid ? 
  last time i remember a lithuanian boy died defending girl from muslim kid who was sending her , his dick pics . 
   think it ca n't happen ? 
  brexit was an explicit rejection of eastern europeans . 
  do n't support the same beliefs . 
  brexit has nothing to do with ee . 
  but with brussels idiotic migration policy . 
  do you even know what [ calais jungle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calais_jungle ) is ? 
  if you want destroy european union , go ahead , support further mena migration , watch your countries burn in further terror attacks , which i hope wo n't happen . 
  you still did n't answer my question , what exactly do these people bring to us that we already do n't have ? 
   there is a lot of value in exchanging information with people that were raised in a completely different environment and had to tackle different issues . 
  * poor + * know what war is + * lived under oppressive regime + * regime imposes flawed ideology + etc. 
  what are you talking about ? 
   i ca n't tell what you 're talking about anymore sperglord . 
  by your comment you 're more of the sperglord . 
  how exactly i miss the point ? 
  ee paying for something they did not ask for , getting blamed for something that can be fixed if only germany was n't stupid enough with their open border policy towards mena people . 
  northern europe = / = nordic ... 
  that 's the thing , most ee were under different european empires , we do n't hold thing called white guilt . 
  we know exactly what getting your nation slowly destroyed means . 
  hmm . 
  instead of being bunch of babbling , bumbling band of baboons , you know , you could just enforce outside eu border , create a join navy if possible and protect italy , greece or spain from future influx of mena people , but instead `` better talk shit about ee '' because that 's how migrant crisis will be solved ... 
  vilnius old town is already expensive af . 
  ** nordics ** are vikings ... 
  it certainly did come out as good . 
  korea already taking over esports , now you want them to take over eurovsion , you madman !, 
  we are your ally , if you will act cool this time . 
  yeah , i forgot ee are not europeans ... we 're way too white and we do not want to endanger our own citizens !, 
  damn you ee !, 
   in fact , the eu would be better without these eastern countries draining their resources . 
  you do realize ee also pay membership fees ? 
  instead of spewing about open borders for mena people we should enforce eu 's outside border that nobody could cross . 
  endangering our own citizens is not the way we want to live . 
  maybe you took some , like we did . 
  most of them escaped to germany any way ... 
  well with brexit , we might get a chance on united european force , maybe brussel 's monkeys will wake up and finally realized it 's time to shut down the borders for mena people . 
  lithuania took around more than 300 refugees , ~ 200 of them ran away to germany . 
  most of them are economic migrants not refugees . 
  they see germany spewing open border policy , massive influx starts , then germany gets mad for not taking `` their share '' , as much as i love eu , the leaders in brussels are retarded, 
  we have latvians , ukrainians , russians more than enough multi-culturism for us . 
  besides how do exactly and by what we get enriched by mena people ? 
  madness , they would certainly win all the time . 
  yeah , yeah ... not endangering our citizens ir racist , great logic you got there . 
  in lithuania they 're not , had ukrainian roommate , friendliest mf i ever met . 
  i do n't understand why western europeans are so keen to take mena people ? 
  why not ukrainians ? 
  this is just madness . 
  ( \uff89 \u25d5 \u30ee \u25d5 ) \uff89 * : \uff65 \uff9f \u2727 sometimes being poor has it 's perks . 
  - 2/3 of refugees we took already gone to germany . 
  living in delusion i see . 
  if you pass several safe countries , you 're not a refugee , but an economic migrant . 
  i know you support human trafficking , but c'mon , tone it down . 
  but , you poor too portugalija . 
  let 's switch uk for japan ? 
  you clearly meant sexbot ? 
  poland , you forget one thing , if we fall you fall too . 
  besides , who needs commonwealth when we can go back to [ baltoscandia !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ), 
  those were people who believed in either national social or fight against bolshevism . 
  i 'm talking about parties like [ golden dawn ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/golden_dawn_members_at_rally_in_athens_2015.jpg/1280px-golden_dawn_members_at_rally_in_athens_2015.jpg ) who look like nothing close to aryan race . 
  considering that neither greeks nor russians were on nazi germany 's side . 
  [ well can go for a joy ride . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/lzdjutydiq8 ), 
  i prefer [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxtphnmdozu ) . 
  in europe redneck is term for `` stupid '' villager . 
  term is more about stupidity than anything . 
   black nazi ny cabbie defends ideology : hitler was misunderstood how stupid can he be . 
  soviets took worst time to invade finland , they were real mad after this match . 
  most like two world wars ... 
  [ hell march is better in my opinion . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2umn5mxyqu ), 
  neo-nazis are not even close to actual nazis , those are just racist red necks that have no idea of national socialism , let alone full nazi ideology , most of them would be considered sub-humans . 
  i laugh everyday when i see russia/greek neo-nazis on the internet . 
   kinda ok to wave red flags in europe because they 're retarded . 
  [ west side vs east side ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oesoc7jvcwq ), 
  thor is just over hyped little bitch . 
  i love how it 's hard to spot curonian spit . 
  just some some hot polish or swedish chicks and watch all the swizz drop the weapons . 
  polish and lithuanian news casters have very similar accent . 
  okay ...
