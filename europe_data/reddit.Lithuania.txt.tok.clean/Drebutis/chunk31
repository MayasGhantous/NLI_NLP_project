  i know in eastern view , partnership means a game at which your partner is put on it 's knees , but in west it works differently , friend . 
  because montenegro was not invaded and occupied by foreign aggressor , was n't put into forests and shot in the head or skinned alive , their children were n't put in animal wagons and sent to siberia etc. 
  if they want piece of us , they will have to invade and go full total war . 
  watch how china will use this as land grab of east russia and japan regaining lost islands . 
  there is no way they can have their little green man action here , since we already learned the lesson and training specifically against that . 
  do n't forget nato ally soldiers that would die in vein and would cause massive outrage in home countries . 
  plus we 're part of eurozone , it 's german interest to keep us safe and protected . 
   if russia attacks you , nato will just leave you . 
  there are german , dutch , french , british , american etc. 
  soldiers on lithuania , latvian and estonian soil , it would cause massive out rage for those governments to let defenders die in vein . 
  i agree , but population does n't get affected by this , other than securing peace in montenegro forever .

  probably because of my own experience , had a classmate whose family came back to lithuania from spain after fall of ussr .

  it 's [ national park ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/trak\u0173_istorinis_nacionalinis_parkas ) . 
  i get you why would you think that way . 
  but then again , it 's westerners who try to impose economic migrants , not us - east euros . 
  i 'm europhile and i want australian/japanese approach towards economic migrants . 
  it 's some idiots within brussels who lost touch with reality , that think that these people are `` engineers and doctors '' that will integrate within european community ... what a joke . 
   very few germans , mostly very old people , identify as prussians . 
  because they had to assimilate into their new homeland when prussia was competently erased from the map by the soviets . 
  most children of prussians come to klaip\u0117da / memel to see how their predecessors lived . 
  since lithuania and poland did n't erase prussian architecture , unlike russia in kaliningrad oblast . 
   the rest would n't care . 
  i do n't know if there would be any kind of reaction by germany other than `` whatever '' . 
  it 's not about germany , it 's about us - lithuanians . 
  prussia holds great value to both german and lithuanian history . 
  it 's very important region during tsarist russia 's occupation of lithuania ( 1795-1918 ) . 
  yeah , i know . 
  but still , modern russian do n't call themselves prussians , if they did , that would cause same shit storm as fyrom does , but nobody gives a damn about german prussians , because most of them were germanized balts that are not only ethnically connected but also culturally to history of prussia . 
  \u017de\u010dpospolita e.g. 
  the republic . 
  how so ? 
  most of them were not only german but dutch/swedish/danish mercenaries that settled in east prussia after failing to subdue lithuania . 
  get off your cave , mr. pessimist . 
  dude such thing exists in ultra-national belaruisan minds . 
  60 % of east prussians had old prussian ( baltic ) ancestry .
