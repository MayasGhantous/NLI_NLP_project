  two very different things . 
  and yet russians praise ussr . 
  pro-commies wander within fantasy land , not me . 
  after all it 's indian people who told brits to bath , clearly they got more than that . 
   poland ; `` chujowo , ale stabilnie '' funny how i can understand that . 
   i am trying to make a point that the fact that soviet union invaded and commited crimes in estonia is not enough justification to help germans in their war effort considering that the germans had plans beyond any evil that the soviets had commited against estonians . 
  except estonians did n't aim their weapons at innocent people , while soviet army did . 
  estonians aimed their weapons against occupational army . 
  yes , it 's terrifying to see people defend soviets . 
  but then again , i actually encountered worse threads where it was swarming with soviet boot lickers . 
  pro-commies out number neo-nazis , because nazi war crimes are actually taught and shown and in no other state it 's white washed , unlike other side who had been lying and hiding it 's war crimes , with a state that today teaches that soviets are heroes . 
  this why i think this thread is quite full of soviet sympathizers . 
   horrible the soviet were , they were never waging a war with the goal to kill and enslave another nation . 
  that 's why half of europe ( eastern europe ) was n't occupied by soviet army , oh wait . 
   what the soviets did in estonia was nothing compared to what the germans were doing to the russians and many others on the eastern front . 
  russians started to murder estonians before nazis crossed ussr 's borders . 
  how is that even an argument ? 
  you , yourself , justifying killings now , even though the estonian dude did not . 
   soviet ideology explicitly sought to improve the world by killing people in forests ? 
  by sending women and children to gulags ? 
  yay !, 
  of course they 're proud because they fought against communism - soviets , the first occupational force that started killing people . 
  not even usa considers them evil or in any way guilty of war crimes , because they did n't participate and were forcefully conscripted . 
   in 1946 , the nuremberg tribunal declared the waffen-ss to be a criminal organization , ** making an exception of people who had been forcibly conscripted ** . 
  throughout the post-war years , the allies would apply this exception to the soldiers of ** the latvian legion and the estonian legion ** . 
  the us displaced persons commission in september 1950 declared that :  '' ** the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) ** are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore ** the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states ** . '', 
   census 1925 - 73.4 % of latvians . 
  10.5 % of russians . 
   census 1989 - 52.0 % of latvians . 
  34.0 % of russians . 
  the only difference is it was done in slower pace so world would n't notice . 
  and the reason we 're not russians now is because ussr also has fallen . 
   the difference is that while estonia ( and the baltics as a whole ) survived up to this day do you even read what i wrote ? 
  the only reasons we 're still on the map is because ussr fell , latvia was already minority in it 's own country during last years of ussr . 
  fucking stop white washing ussr , both nazis and soviets deserve to die in hell . 
  i mean technically you can consider nazis `` liberators '' of baltics , since soviets invaded and occupied us first . 
  yeah , it 's better to be raped and killed , than just killed , wonderful . 
  western allies liberated , ussr re-occupied . 
  i wonder where do they live and how do they even manage to breed before cutting each others throats on who is more commie than other . 
  they were not nazis . 
  btfo soviet scumbags, 
   oh jeez , we demand ukrainians pitying their brave soldiers   predominantly of volunteers - estonian waffen ss legions were not predominantly volunteers . 
  they 're probably soviet boot lickers . 
  they were getting russified ( oh sorry , sovietized ) under ussr , what 's the fucking difference ? 
  none , both are terrible regimes , none deserves to be defended , yet people want to look at nazi germany more and ignore ussr . 
  he never justified nazi crimes . 
   hitlerjugend ussr had same [ shit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_lenin_all-union_pioneer_organization ) . 
  then again , he 's theoretical physicist , not politician , let alone economist . 
  ca n't you understand word `` lesser evil '' ? 
  nazis killed less lithuanians than soviets did during ww2 . 
  if ussr did n't fell , lithuania would have seized to exist too . 
  find better ideology , because communism will never work . 
  it 's for idiots who believe in fairy tales , wake up , this is reality , not a dream . 
  every commie state has blood on it 's hands . 
  it looks nice on paper , but will never work in reality . 
  commie era brings only misery and suffering , it does not create utopia . 
   albert einstein sources on that ? 
  either way , he was living when commie war crimes were still unknown . 
   the balts baltics * , [ balts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) is term for ethnicity , baltic is mostly a geographical term . 
   they made a pact to partition poland and to not attack each other , until hitler launched operation barbarossa . 
  sounds something that allies would do . 
  both nazi and commie parties , symbols etc are banned to public places . 
  exactly , even mussolini was n't very fond of nazism , because that meant his nation would be lower class race . 
  it does n't matter , take any commie country , it always involves murdering people . 
   genocide and extreme authoritarianism . . and communism was n't ? 
  are you even taught of crimes that soviets made ? 
  no matter where and when you will adapt `` communism '' it will never work , it works only in paper , not in reality , better ditch this idea once and for all . 
   i have a hard time considering the ussr as more evil than nazi germany ... for us , nazi germany was lesser evil . 
   hitler wanted erase entire peoples , all their history and all their culture denied the right to exist . 
  ussr did exactly same , just in far slower pace . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) now , now tiny belarus , deep inside you know you 're just [ slavicized balts ] ( https://i.imgur.com/0uulnjx.jpg ) , but you can become [ pure balts ] ( https://i.imgur.com/goo27w2.png ) again . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) just say three magic words and we will hug you . 
  we do n't want native lithuanian lands , we want whole [ grand duchy of lithuania ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jqso1e0.jpg ) back !, 
  yet , ethnic russians were ones of the most brutal animals that entered our country , did n't even manage to topple nazi occupation . 
   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  i 'm just saying that people give too much good credits to ussr , they fought for their own survival while raping other countries on the way to berlin , that had nothing to do with nazism itself . 
  pointing out facts - butthurt , okay ... 
  russia did n't even make up half of ussr population , so stfu , you should be thankful to ukrainians , belarusians , central asians too for saving your ass from nazism . 
  considering if not the west 's help , ussr would have fallen to the third reich . 
  being forced into an exile is different from just running away . 
  they did n't ran away , they worked from foreign ground , since homeland was occupied by foreign entity . 
  if they stayed they would end up dead , like most political prisoners ended up in rainiai massacre . 
  this was during first soviet occupation :  according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  they won against lithuanian partisans but they did n't won against our legitimate government , it stayed in exile during whole cold war , republic of lithuania was erased from the map and replaced by puppet state - lssr , during soviet occupation . 
  what are you smoking , honestly , where is this coming from ? 
  what the hell it has to do with the nazis ? 
  foreign army crossed our border , either killed or forced our government to run into exile while starting the red terror - beginning of soviet occupation . 
  what are you smoking ? 
  just because you lost does n't mean occupation becomes `` legal '' . 
  there is no such thing as legal occupation . 
   arguing with you is pointless . 
  the only country to activly not fight against the annexation diplomatically was the usa and the rest more or less had accepted it silently . 
  maybe start reading what i wrote : only 8 nations recognized de jure control , including yours which is not surprising , your nation was shitting pants back then and 36 that did not recognize de jure control , the rest of the world stayed out of this issue . 
    on 15 august 2011 , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt officially apologized to the prime ministers of estonia , latvia , and lithuania at a ceremony in stockholm saying that '' ** sweden owes its baltic neighbours a `` debt of honour '' for turning a blind eye to post-war soviet occupation ** '' and speaking of `` a dark moment '' in his country 's history . 
  -  also international law is no codex and only what is practised and what the countries voluntarily behave by is `` law '' . 
  you 're lost beyond reasoning , i do n't understand your motive to prove that baltic states `` voluntary '' joined ussr . 
   do n't reply , it 's fucking pointless . 
  then do n't start talking total non sense . 
   well if you lost the conflict , why complain about it ? 
  so we should just bend over ?
