  is that what you 're saying . 
   just to play devil 's advocate . 
  the baltics were part of russia for several centuries and thus they are an integral part of the ussr . 
  god you 're uneducated . 
  lithuania was part of russian empire for 123 years , even then , we share nothing in common with them other than old ass soviet commieblocks that are getting europenized with eu funds . 
   combine this with the might ( = right ) of the su and you were de jure part of the ussr . 
  international law  your word . 
  end of story . 
  half of europe lost the conflict , why do you think west did n't invade ussr , it had largest conventional military in the world . 
  because there is such thing as international law . 
  we were de facto controlled , not de jure , which makes it occupation , not annexation . 
  lithuanian occupation resistance fought ussr for 9 years after ww2 to free lithuania ... 
  foreign military enters your country , kicks out legitimate government into exile or just kills them on the spot , like [ rainiai massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainiai_massacre ) , that was the reason why nazis were seen as liberators , because of soviet brutality . 
  soviet occupational army forms pro-soviet government , mostly from those that ran to ussr after lithuanians won [ lithuanian-soviet war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian%e2%80%93soviet_war ) , while our president a. smetona , escaped soviet occupation by going to west , later to go to brazil and settle in usa , he never abdicated president of lithuania post . 
  new non-legitimate , non recognized soviet government form a letter to join ussr , of course ussr agrees . 
  and then year later nazi occupation happens and soviet re-occupation , there were there no partisan war against nazis , but there was 9 years [ partisan war ] ( lithuanian partisans ) against ussr . 
  lithuanian was biggest spot of partisan movement and most brutal against soviet sympathizers , if you were collaborating with soviets you would instantly get assassinated , some say it 's the reason why we have low russian minority , since new colonizers feared of getting killed . 
  the only reason baltic states occupation lasted for 50 years because it was occupied by superpower without any way to escape , lithuanians hoped for americans to start war against ussr during partisan war . 
  lithuanians [ children ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/romas_kalanta ) would burn themselves to protest soviet occupation , [ world did not recognize baltic incorporation into ussr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states#list_of_recognition_and_non-recognition_of_annexation ) . 
  and if baltics joined ussr by legitimate means , we would have had every right to leave it without [ ussr using army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania \\ ) ) . 
  * comrades , you have nothing to lose but your chains !, 
  * * and your freedom !, 
  * * and your food !, 
  * * and your life , but by that time you 'd be starving in siberian gulag so you would n't care . 
  oh yes , we hunt russian babies for their blood . 
  never knew . 
  belarus is like non-existant to us even though we share practically 800 years of history . 
   there were 121,345 speakers of lithuanian in the prussian census of 1890 . 
  isis is not next to our door . 
   more money from the eu , so what would be the point for improving relations ? 
  belarus is not part of eu , wtf . 
  we have sanctions on belarus , if there is one reason for warmer relations is to ease up sanctions . 
  because russians erased their state , they had to assimilate to either to west germans or lithuanians . 
  lietuvninkais ( prussian lithuanian ) we are born, 
  hover over my flair, 
  contrary , when russia loves to take achievements of soviets as their , but deny involvement in soviet committed massacres . 
  [ sorry , i love map of ostland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/reichskommissariat_ostland_administrative.png/800px-reichskommissariat_ostland_administrative.png ) , more than grand duchy within commonwealth . 
  shush , it 's all reich now . 
  well our problem was uk that blocked european army , now that they 're out we might see change in what americans actually want from european nations . 
  that 's exactly what are we doing too . 
  and [ lithuanians are notoriously known for their partisan war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_partisans ) . 
  it lasted for 9 years after end of ww2 , the only reason it ended because soviets started to send spies into new partisan recruits and hope of west invasion of soviet union was declining . 
  some say due to successfully killing every soviet sympathizer , we have lower russian minority due to colonizers being in fear of getting killed when soviets were relocating local population while importing russian speakers . 
  come . 
  come . 
  give me your potatoes . 
  you do realize soviets were first to occupy us ? 
  how the hell can we guard something that did n't exist . 
  stop talking bullshit . 
   according to the balts killing baltic nazis that gassed jews is a crime to humanity . 
  0/10 on trying to troll . 
  so fucking bad ;d, 
  first of all do n't say balts , balts are lithuanians and latvians , not estonians , all three of us are geographically near baltic sea , that 's why estonia is included in baltic countries . 
  second we do n't celebrate hitler of nazi germany , iirc only latvians are doing it , but they celebrate bravery of latvian men who fought against soviet forces , again not hitler of nazi regime . 
  pretty sure instead of nazi germany all world would be fighting soviet union , hitting two birds with one stone . 
  poland has no feelings , you 're [ the devil ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dqj78j4.png ) !, 
  because he 's butthurt that we hate soviet union more than nazi germany , both regimes are hellish , except nazi regime was far less awful in the baltics compare to soviet one . 
   nazi germany was a genocidal racist regime that would have killed millions upon millions in all occupied countries . 
  so did stalin , you forget that stalin has more deaths under his belt than hitler . 
  -  that the baltic states see this racist freak as more humane than stalin shows their warped mindset . 
  you 're pure idiot . 
  this was during first ( 1940-1941 ) soviet occupation :   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  -  hitler planned to kill hundred times more people and yet the baltic maniacs think he was a great guy . 
  that 's what you think that `` we think '' , you 're talking total bullshit , unlike russia we do n't praise murderous psycho and do n't have statues of him . 
  why do you lump baltic states into one ? 
  besides learn history instead of being brainwashed . 
   oberf\u00fchrer adolf ax , commander of the 15th division , reported on 27 january 1945 : '' ** they are first and foremost latvians . 
  they want a sustainable latvian nation state . 
  forced to choose between germany and russia , they have chosen germany , because they seek co-operation with western civilization . 
  the rule of the germans seems to them to be the lesser of two evils . 
  ** ''  this perspective resulted in part from ** the soviet occupation between 1940 and 1941 , called `` the year of terror '' ** ( latvian : baigais gads ) during which ** tens of thousands of latvian families were executed or deported to siberia ** with men separated from the women and children to break down resistance . 
   legion command emphasized that the latvians were fighting against soviet re-occupation . 
  conscripts promised in the name of god to be subservient to the german military and its commander adolf hitler , to be courageous and to be prepared to give up their life in the fight against bolshevism . 
   this sentiment was also reflected in one of the most popular legion songs which went '' ** we will beat the russians now and we will beat the germans after that ** '' ( with euphemisms for russians and germans ) . 
  most important part :  in 1946 , the nuremberg tribunal declared the waffen-ss to be a criminal organization , making an exception of people who had been forcibly conscripted . 
  throughout the post-war years , the allies would apply this exception to the soldiers of the latvian legion and the estonian legion . 
  the us displaced persons commission in september 1950 declared that :  `` the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and ** therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states ** . '', 
  so please , learn history . 
  poska is still behind us , even if we go backwards . 
  this is all hypothesis , just like your idea of russia being a superpower in current times . 
  as i said , it has potential , but it is far from it . 
  more like you who talks non sense without any facts or scientific researches , who thinks you and i are the same . 
  you talk things that makes me laugh . 
  that 's not a definition of superpower , if n. korea launched it 's all nukes on ice caps , a lot of population would also die , does that make them superpower ? 
  and you fight better next time so you would n't be blown into bits . 
   they were , however , only in a very small part like you , as over the ages they bred with other tribes and their culture changed with times/outside influence . 
  [ nope . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/0uulnjx.jpg ) original lithuanian culture changed only after christinization , yes , but tribe that lived in modern lithuania did not breed with outsiders . 
   hahaha , they totally did `` change genetics '' and with great fervor . 
  in your dreams maybe . 
  what ties within latin america ? 
  you clearly meant ussr , not russia , which was superpower . 
  and syria is not `` whole middle east '' . 
  this is not global scale , you 're talking bs , again trying way too hard to prove . 
  russia is potential superpower , but is not one at this moment . 
   are you blind or just so afraid of russia ? 
  no , i 'm not blind , thanks for asking and yes , of course i 'm afraid of russia after they pillaged and raped my country two times and now posing as a threat once again . 
  yeah , most likely . 
  in lithuania many languages were lingua franca , from german , polish , old chruch slavonic , latin , french , russian and english . 
  stop talking non-sense okay ?
