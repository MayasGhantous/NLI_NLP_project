   and the revived commonwealth was meant to be a federation embracing the many cultures within it . 
  key word - culture , not language that was dying off under union . 
  the second federation only meant complete extermination of our language . 
  interwar poland did everything to suppress lithuanian language in vilnius region even though it was small percentage of people . 
   this concept competed with the nationalism ideal of leaving the kresy behind and making a country primarily for poles . 
  what ended up happening was something in the middle , that neither side was happy with . 
  your `` kresy '' is not our problem , so we do n't give a damn . 
  what today is that we 're happy we 're finally having our own country , with lithuanian language as official and main language of the country . 
  well most poles on this reddit think quite different , no matter how many facts you throw at them . 
  yes , i do n't mind minority , but i would rather prefer german/polish one than russian one and you clearly understand why . 
  but ... 
  but ... [ muh glorious battle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna ) !, 
  you would be surprised . 
  i 'm actually quite surprised when poland calls lithuanians nationalistic nation when you compare their [ [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/mi\u0119dzymorze_%28intermarum%29_1919-1921.png ) ] ;[ [ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/mapka_miedzymorza.png ) ] ; dreams and ours [ [ 1 ] ( http://www.maps4u.lt/lt/includes/siuntiniai/z/lithuania_1918-1940_valsciai_600.jpg ) ] . 
  poles would never claim him lithuanian , he 's `` pure pole '' . 
  the territory was also somehow `` pure polish '' just because majority of population happen to be polish speaking , ignoring several hundred years of history of that region . 
  and yes you 're right , the problem is that lithuanians did n't want to have anything with poland , we wanted independent state , not being polish right hand again . 
  he 's mostly hated for letting \u017deligovski ' mutiny to happen . 
   but you can not use it as a justification for why you do n't want to accept current migrants as we countries do , because the situations are not similar . 
  yes we can , we 're small , we already have minorities , taking more would undermine our own nationality/ethnicity . 
  by the end of ussr latvia was already a dying nation , because at least half of it 's population was already russian . 
  though lithuania is going to accept 1k refugees this year . 
   you are clearly biased ; what 's so biased on me ? 
   so what was the price ? 
  nothing , they just gave up territories to su on which they held ground . 
   he would be bad if he had captured kaunas , he only took what was ours `` yours '' . 
  nazi germany also took what was `` theirs '' . 
  russia also takes what is `` theirs '' . 
  almost half of interwar poland was n't even polish . 
  free city of danzig had only + -3 % of polish population , yet you wanted it . 
  also you wanted all of lithuania , the only thing that stopped you is international recognition which would have painted you as complete aggressor to neighbours . 
  also after you gave us ultimatum in 1939 you threaten us with invasion . 
  hardly , pilsudski was a dick to lithuanians for sure . 
   so he is comparing him to bandera shukhevych and others no he 's not , pilsudski was bad for us , you clearly know why . 
  also he sold ukraine/belarus to ussr so i do n't think he 's viewed lightly either in those countries , let alone russia . 
  while germany probably does n't even give a sh * t about him . 
  sit under the rock , son . 
  what it has with eu funds ? 
  when russia will be able to once again black mail or impose higher gas prices ? 
  they 're immigrants . 
  you ca n't compare poles and even germans whose ancestors came and settled their lives in lithuanian/latvian/estonian borders for +400 ~ years and those russians who lived for what ? 
  40 years max ? 
  who were forcefully re-located by ussr . 
  they might be citizens of our countries , but their still immigrants , not natives . 
   they were the citizens of a common country which is dead now , so they 're not citizens of soviet union any more . 
  he did not compare him , read again . 
  he 's showing controversial leaders . 
   poland loves pilsudki which was ** warhawk to neighbours ** he 's not comparing them to others as he already gave his thought on him . 
  poland , even though we had warm and cold together with you , thanks for civilization you brought . 
  - latvians are strongest of occupied balts ( ~ 700 years !, 
  ) , congrats for surviving , you people have balls of steel . 
   - ~ ~ russia ~ ~ germany , even though you were our first grestest nemesis , i want to thank you for helping us to print legally books in our language , when russian empire oppressed lithuanian people with press ban , thanks for helping us kick commies out of lithuania in aftermath of ww1 and over all now being part of eu helping our economy recover and once against training and protecting each other side-by-side as fellow nato forces . 
  but most polluted . 
  we banned ** energy ** drinks for minors , not coca-colas or sprites . 
  well , the difference between ukraine , moldova and poland is that one is in eu . 
  [ make lithuania great again !, 
  still losing one castle is like losing part of history . 
  should be a walk in the park . 
  yeah well , but considering total population of turkey it 's small fraction . 
  nonetheless turkey , just like russia is rather transcontinental and has `` special '' status . 
  for worst turkey would be authoritarian republic , but it 's far from being totalitarian . 
  nobody , literally nobody consider russia as superpower . 
  it does n't fit the criteria no matter how many times you will repeat `` russia is superpower , stronk !, 
  good to be on your side germany . 
  it 's [ good guy germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) . 
  boys !!, 
  i 'm back !, 
  but lithuania is just province of russia , comrade . 
  too bad you ca n't accept the truth and fact . 
  you missed german empire . 
  you do n't train martial art , you train to survive and if possible make enemy weaker . 
  you do n't need big brains for that , just clever thinking . 
  we 're living next to most militarized region in europe , which also has nukes , that region is controlled by a country that likes to be aggressive towards it 's neighbours . 
  these books for sure are not waste of money knowing history between russia and lithuania . 
  that 's why they 're potential superpower , if it federalized it would become strongest country on earth , surpassing usa . 
  usa is sole superpower , the rest are potential superpowers which also includes eu . 
  too bad this [ idea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) was born in wrong century ( on peak of nationalism ) . 
   afraid of a not existing invasion tell that to georgia , tell that to moldova , tell that to ukraine , tell that to fucking dutch people who lost families/friends in plane which got shot by russian given buk missile system , most likely operated but russians themselves . 
  [ whataboutism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) you already talking like true putin 's ass kisser . 
  it does n't fit the criteria . 
  just because you think russia is `` superpower '' does not mean it 's to the rest of the world . 
  why ? 
   eu 's constitution federalists wet dream . 
  that still does n't make russia a superpower . 
  that still does not make them superpower . 
  considering russia next to usa is retarded . 
  cepelinai master race represent . 
  in your tiny head , probably . 
  russia 's defense budget : $ 64,000,000,000 usa 's defense budget : $ 689,591,000,000 do you even see the difference ? 
   and , like it or not , russia is a superpower . 
  ( 2nd most powerful army ) russia has 5th largest army in the world fyi . 
  with unreliable equipment and economy size that of italy even though it has all the resources in the world , that 's actually really saddening . 
  - so no it is not , it does n't fill the criteria of being superpower to begin with . 
  feels like you do n't know what is a [ superpower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superpower ) . 
  with your logic we can consider north korea to be a superpower . 
   superpower is a word used to describe a state with a dominant position in international relations and which is characterised by its unparalleled ability to exert ** influence or project power ** on a ** global scale ** . 
   alice lyman miller defines a ** superpower ** as `` a country that has the capacity ** to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world ** , and sometimes , in ** more than one region of the globe ** at a time , and so may plausibly attain the status of global hegemony . '', 
  only southern part of estonia . 
  kievan rus ' was first to raid us , we just returned the favour . 
   you first started this ' i have you tagged as such ' .
