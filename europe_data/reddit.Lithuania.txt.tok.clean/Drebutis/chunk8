  i mean a nation of +300 k people ca n't get better candidate than those two ? 
  of course out of those two i would probably take clinton since she 's more keen to fight against russians than trump , who kisses putin 's ass . 
  umm , no . 
  either treat every eu member equally or piss off . 
  i mean your system is strange , why choose between two when you can have third party one ? 
  in 2014 were there 7 legitimate candidates in lithuanian presidential election . 
  that 's the point of democracy , you choose best option . 
  only when [ boogyman cross ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) our border . 
  well france 's dream was always to dominate all german states , he achieved that . 
  it 's sad we 're not neighbours any more . 
  northern germany best germany . 
  we do n't use that filthy word - `` jihad '' , we say `` crusade '' , like true europeans . 
  ^ ^ ^ [ context ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades ) . 
  grand duchy of luxembourg ofc !, 
   and to me , `` nationalism '' has the connotation of superiority . 
  that 's ultra-nationalism or you can even call it fascism . 
  nationalism is not a bad thing , it 's the reason why small nations manage to survive and obtain their freedom . 
  no , they want ceta badly . 
  good for you romania . 
  you already have trump vs hillary enjoy your idiocracy . 
   `` dark '' legions is it what i think it is ? 
  who the hell would want to ally with hell hole called ussr ? 
  it was second most evil place on earth . 
  yeah no shit sherlock , i 'm talking about hair , eye colour , not bloody skin tan level . 
  they just mixed less , so they probably look more like italians . 
  because croats are mix between og inhabitants - illyrians and slavs . 
  it 's about genetics , not the sun ... 
  [ donis - reiks joti vainu\u017e\u0117l\u0117n ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-awdyg8gxda ), 
  without things that want to kill you . 
  your nation is quite cringy . 
  especially serbians themselves - the russian bootlickers . 
  [ that 's yurovision ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eilct2ufpkg ) !, 
  relatively homogeneous northern countries . 
  despite lithuania being catholic nation it has `` protestant work ethics '' . 
  low population densities and over all low total population . 
  top notch counter argument . 
  you might as well start reading and putting your face into a book for once . 
  instead of talking non-sense . 
  and since you 're lazy the very first sentence on lithuanian culture is . 
  latvian and estonian connections are even deeper . 
    the culture of lithuania combines an indigenous heritage , represented by the unique lithuanian language , with nordic cultural aspects and christian traditions resulting from historical ties with poland . 
  it has something to do with [ religion ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rpsh4en.png ) . 
  til greece , italy , spain etc are eastern european . 
  narrowing to just that is stupid you know ? 
   as opposed to nonexistant centuries old cultural ties with scandinavia ? 
  you literally have 0 knowledge on lithuania 's history . 
   meanwhile communist heritage is a huge common ground . 
  what fucking heritage ? 
  does every state that was occupied by nazis also have common heritage ? 
   you 're culturally and visually much closer to slovakia than sweden . 
  prove it . 
  we literally have 0 history with slovakia other than kicking anti-habsburg hungarian ass there . 
   prove to people that ee can be awesome after you stop shit talking like a bunch of ignorant c * nts . 
   the lithuanians started to call them `` rutherians '' that 's absolute bollocks . 
  you 're mixing things up completely . 
  lithuanians never called themselves ruthenians , contrary , ruthenians started to call themselves lithuanians . 
    while at the beginning the nobility was almost all lithuanian , with ** territorial expansion ** more ** ruthenian families joined lithuanian nobility ** . 
  as early as the 16th century , ** several ruthenian noble families ** began to call themselves ** gente ruthenus , natione lithuanus ** . 
   many times it 's covered by northern europe ( baltics ) i mean we do n't fall in any category as ee state , other than being ex-occupied countries by ussr . 
  people who only know cold war and little to nothing else will always call us ee . 
  balts ( especially lithuanians ) did raid kievan rus ' . 
  blonde hair and blue eyes is common trait of northern people . 
   the english , scots , irish , latvians , lithuanians , estonians , russians were also considered to be viking . 
  here is a map i found on wikipedia . 
  only scandinavians and iirc estonians had vikings . 
  the rest were only [ influenced ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xozpi0o.jpg ) or had viking settlements . 
  western europe i presume , they still consider `` eastern bloc '' as their turf even if they hold 0 hands on it . 
  well russia is one of the states who was born from fractured kievan rus ' ( which raided us and we raided them back ) and that grand principality of muscovy was one of our greatest medieval enemies . 
  so what ? 
  at least france or uk are not invading , annexing , sabotaging neighbouring countries . 
  it 's definitely not usa . 
  we always had either neutral or adversary relations with russia since medieval times . 
   first of , black market for fuel is thriving . 
  because it 's also dirt cheap in russian and belarus , i wonder why ...  secondly , i personally can say that a significant number of young people from vilnius go shopping in poland . 
  does n't change the fact it 's only 1 % . 
   that 's why we have a thriving black market , people going shopping in poland . 
  our black market is mainly cigarettes because of how dirt cheap they 're in belarus and probably kaliningrad . 
  besides number of people who go to shop to poland rather than lithuania is around 1 % of total population of lithuania which makes it totally irrelevant . 
  media fucking your brains . 
  i mean the biggest difference in prices i saw was on how much money i spent on my hair style which was like 50 non euro cents more , which is absolute nothing . 
  too much filthyfrank . 
  meh , their choice . 
  then you 're dumb sheep if you ca n't spot the difference . 
  i guess it 's just special case with russia . 
  they just do n't want to abandon `` russia stronk xaxaxa cyka blyat '' mentality . 
  you monster , spare the guy that is going to read . 
  [ mfw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6f_5iymijk#t=4m10s ) when i see hungarian word . 
  sadly i knew this video mate . 
   also , the euro would jack up prices here so bad that i am glad to not have it , to be honest . 
  beginning of poem '' [ metai - the seasons ] ( http://old.antologija.lt/pdf/6.pdf ) '' made by prussian lithuanian poet [ kristijonas donelaitis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kristijonas_donelaitis ) . 
   there is also the issue of greater eu representation , most smaller countries have larger groups to which they belong in order to pool power and counter france/germany/italy etc , eg visegrad , benelux , nordic council , bsec and the baltic assembly . 
  they can just create celtic assembly with ireland . 
  9/11 is fall of berlin wall . 
  dunno what kind of meme are you making out of it . 
  because they want to fulfil reich 's dream . 
  you joking , right ? 
  hundred years ? 
  amateur , past millennia is the reason why we will never be friends with russia . 
  so it makes it okay for russia do what it does best , create suffering ? 
  in europe religion is rather cultural thing , it does n't affect daily life .
