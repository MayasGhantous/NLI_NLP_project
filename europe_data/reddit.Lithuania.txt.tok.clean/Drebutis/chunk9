   still jan sobieski and therefore lithuania , shaped today 's europe most by defeating ottoman 's during 2nd vienna siege . 
  actually it 's purely polish victory . 
  though one could say we were one nation as [ polish-lithuanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) ( equal to that of british , not in modern sense ) identity was being born . 
   when the main polish army under the king of poland john iii sobieski , who was nominated the supreme commander of the holy league , marched on vienna and played a decisive role in the battle , it left poland undefended . 
  as a result , the lithuanian troops were drawn into a fight along the polish border tying down the anti-hapsburg hungarian kuruc forces under the vassal king of upper hungary , imre th\u00f6k\u00f6ly along the border between upper hungary and poland . 
  our army finally reached only in aftermath of the battle . 
  pretty sure people are surprised when they see the size of [ grand duchy of lithuania and then modern lithuania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xzyc6vu.jpg ) . 
   why lithuania in the eu ? 
  germans just want to know why we choose to be in the reich . 
   first try to solve your identity issues like nordic/slavic/else , then embrace said identity and start promoting it aggressively . 
  you do realize lithuanians and latvians are ethnically and linguistically balts , while estonians are finno-ugrics . 
  neither of us are slavic or nordic . 
  ca n't be great without making [ union with lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) to rule whole of baltic sea . 
   and nato , with its american influence i literally feel 0 influence . 
  because it does n't make sense in any field . 
  not belarus only ruthenian duchies + early grand duchy of lithuania . 
  because we like to [ twerk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wp7y2yu.gif ) . 
  so much twerking that ass is in the air . 
  twerking in the corner . 
   [ kicks door open ] ftfy, 
  in lithuania he 's translated as `` ivanas r\u016bstusis '' something like `` ivan the wrathful '' . 
  `` liberated '', 
  i can see polish-lithuanian commonwealth at it 's greatest extent . 
  also lithuania ( maybe even kingdom of lithuania 1918 ) itself . 
  i meant soviets . 
  you really think they did n't had list ready for deportations and executions ? 
  so what was your point ? 
  that belarusian territories were inhabited by lithuanian and poles once , thus we can call ourselves one ? 
   all i wanted to say that the people living on the territory of the modern day belarus ( thus territorially `` belarusians '' ) were called lithuanians back in the day . 
  people who lived there , who are not living there any more . 
  only belarusians are there , barely any lithuanian or pole is left . 
  you were called ruthenians , not lithuanians . 
  how is that nationalism , when it is a good idea ? 
  it will save time for shipment to come and will avoid russian interference over their own ships . 
   i linked a map , where you can definitely see that the area marked `` lithuanians '' covers not only the modern day lithuanian territory , but also a part of the modern day belarus territory . 
  look at the map i linked . 
  i think it 's fair to say that there are people living on these territories now who are the descendants of those who lived there back then . 
  modern belarusians have nothing to do with baltic lithuanians . 
  those balts that used to [ inhabit whole of belarus ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaizdas:baltic_hydronyms_location_map.png ) got pushed into what is today lithuania/latvia and what used to be east prussia . 
  after that neither we were pushed out of it , nor we were assimilated , up until whole eastern lithuania became polonized , it was fully lithuanian . 
  vilnius region was completely polonized and most of them considered to be either polish or lithuania , but never a belarusian and after ww2 those polish-lithuanians fled or were forcefully transferred to poland by soviet authorities . 
  so in no way belarusians have descendants of pagan lithuanians . 
   plus it 's `` circa 1200 '' so it 's safe to assume that people from these territories might as well went even further south-east during the following centuries . 
  actually contrary [ western balts assimilated ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y5qt965.png ) into lithuanians , while ruthenians retained their ethnic positioning . 
  unlike most duchies/kingdoms/empires etc. 
  we did n't force our language onto local population , only our rule of law . 
  there is a saying `` in grand principality of muscovites there is tyranny and suffering , in grand duchy of lithuania there is peace and prosperity '' . 
  after union of liublin western lithuanians became polonized , while western lithuanians became germinized , only samogitians were n't influenced by either . 
   i ca n't see the point you 're trying to make . 
  i only mentioned historical and modern facts . 
  your own facts , that suits you . 
   let 's look at the wiki page : `` the statutes of the grand duchy of lithuania name the complete name of the state as grand duchy of lithuania , ruthenia and samogitia '' . 
  now look at the map i linked and see where the samogitia is . 
  now look at where the rest of the territory marked as `` lithuania '' lies . 
  now look at the modern map of belarus and say whether there is overlap with that territory . 
  does that make russian asian country ? 
  all you 're trying is to steal country 's history . 
  calling lithuanians samogitians and belarusians lithuanians , that 's just dumb . 
  even under gdl you were ruthenians , such thing as belarus or belarusians did n't even exist to begin with . 
  [ lithuanians united balts ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png ) , they conquered ruthenian duchies , their nobility gradually became lithuanian one , to be soon be replaced as polish one either way , end of story . 
   i never called myself a litvin btw . 
  i just said that there are people who identify as that and explained their reasoning for it . 
  no need to get so upset about it . 
  the things you say indicates you 're one . 
  for a good reason . 
  and you think soviets have n't had such lists ? 
   belerus should be lithuania along with current lithuania and few other changes that did n't happen because entente did n't want to make russia angsty about new power between them and poland . 
  you do realize lithuanian refused to re-create gdl borders which would include belarus ? 
  even that belarus did n't wanted to be part of lithuania since they wanted to become independent too . 
   we used to be considered lithuanians circa 1200 : mate you what ? 
  are you telling me now that belarusians are actually baltic lithuanians ? 
  xd  where lithuania was used to refer to the modern belarusian territory ( more or less ) , while `` zhamoitia '' referred to the land which comprise the modern day lithuania ( zhamoitia - samogitia on the map i linked ) oh you look a litvin appeared . 
  thing is that lithuanians/latvian ( balts ) , estonian/finns ( finnics ) are not slavs . 
  [ europe still has colonies all over the world ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yctqhz8.png ) , it 's that they can govern themselves !, 
  i rather wished americans and other allies came for us , not one brutal animal to be replaced with another brutal animal . 
  and it 's not filled with soviet apologists ? 
  canada is actually neo-soviet union . 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  the deluge ( second northern war ) was far worse than ww2 in casualty percentage . 
  stupid canadians , why you no invade soviet union !!, 
  we still were left in [ total depression ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_curtain ) . 
  you would n't want angry europe . 
  last time we let out emotions out , two world wars broke out . 
  so putin is literally hitler ? 
  good tip , ghandi . 
  nice that you talk load of shit about my country , but clearly do n't give a shit about yours . 
   i believe that the territory should belong to the country that has majority of population in that region , is that so strange to you ? 
  yes because if you believe in that then france , germany , hungary , sweden can annex territories that belong to neighbouring countries that have majority of their population . 
  you broke a treaty under false flag . 
  what you did was back-stab , instead of peace you choose unrest . 
  besides half of poland again , was n't fully ethnically polish , so it 's ironic to read your first sentence . 
   it 's historically and culturaly important to me but nothing more . 
  how it 's historically and culturally important to you ? 
  you ( as person ) literally have no connection to it . 
  historically speaking region itself was majority lithuanian speaking before union of liublin and still after that was still part of grand duchy of lithuania and kept being centre of it . 
  the only time poland held vilnius region was after ww1 . 
  before rise of nationalism polish speaking population considered themselves lithuanians and most of them were actually ethniclly lithuanians , your very own pilsudski was from ethnically lithuanian family that dates back to pagan times . 
  all of them have break-away cancer `` republics '' who are backed only by russia . 
   im sure plenty of lithuanian nationalists of interwar period would 've gladly accepted the deal where for 50 year long membership in soviet federation they 'd get the lost lands back . 
  yeah sure , [ first soviet-lithuanian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) really showed that .
