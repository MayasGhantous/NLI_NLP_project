he 's against gay marriage . 
  he was against the gay parade in vilnius . 
  he has stated that instead of fighting for lgbt rights , homosexual people should `` fight their own inner battles '' . 
  i imagine the headlines in 5 years : `` an 18 year old teenager died of red bull and jaggermeister overdose during his birthday '', 
  well , he is not wrong . 
  i liked the part where the website was advertising rolex watches when talking about the roma . 
  hey there !, 
  hopefully i am not that late !, 
  what 's georgias view on lithuania ? 
  lithuanians in particular treat georgians as their second best friend after latvia . 
  considering the distance , that 's actually quite awesome . 
  do you guys have the same feeling towards us ? 
  i love your wine  . 
  lithuanian here . 
  i wo n't lie , you guys trying to figure out the word brought me a chuckle . 
  let me try to clear the word out : did\u017eia - great rusi\u0161 - russian kumas - `` ism '' kumas just turns the adjective in to a noun . 
  rusi\u0161kas ( russian , adjective ) gets turned in to rusi\u0161kumas ( noun ) . 
  the closest you can get is `` great russiaism '' . 
  vargas means misery in lithuanian . 
  it all makes sense !, 
  so their master plan is to send gays in to space ? 
  ** vilnius ** population : 50 % polish 50 % hipsters, 
  and she is smart !, 
  forget dem double d 's , gim me that oxford phd !, 
  i am from klaipeda and it 's even more hilarious that the only `` pro-russian '' people are 60 year old pensioners who are still nostalgic . 
  these people , who have been living in lithuania for numerous decades have n't bothered to learn lithuanian . 
  if a young bloke like me refuses to talk to them in russian , they will get pissed , as if it is my duty to know russian , even though the only time i will need to speak russian is when i am buying potatoes from those very same pensioners . 
  the younger russian generation has no problem talking both russian and lithuanian . 
  russia would have to supply these `` rebels '' not with guns and ammunition , but with hemorrhoid medication . 
  [ i propose this design .

  fighting yuri in the future . 
  you mean you `` hired a babysitter '' to do the spanking for you ? 
  you are wrong . 
  you speak weird !, 
  skipping vowels and shit . 
  lithuania - the second most suicidal country in the world , the third most miserable country in the world ? 
  now we 're third in alcohol consumption ? 
  that 's actually quite depressing . 
  brb , gon na drown my sorrows . 
  the problem with legalizing marijuana , you are opening a huge market . 
  food , drinks and other products containing thc will become a thing . 
  a lot of these products will be targeting ~ ~ children ~ ~ stoners . 
  and it 's not just some random farmer growing weed and selling it in his own brick and mortar store . 
  huge corporations , brands , which will do everything they can to encourage weed consumption . 
  when you think about it , it 's actually quite scary . 
  i am for decriminalizing low quantity growing for personal use and possession , but full blown legalization ? 
  are we ready ? 
  alas , i am currently in the uk :3, 
  if you are in to electronic music ( not edm ) , berlin hands down . 
  `` it is washington that ; s behind it , keeping the armed forces of the baltic states fully-equipped and including them in nato programs , '' said morozov . 
  i agree , this is ridiculous !, 
  fuck those western capitalist pigs for doing everything they can to stop the baltic states in to joining the warm embrace of mother russia . 
  look how well belarus is doing ? 
  who does n't want that ? 
  lithuania obviously does and they would have succeeded if not for those pesky meddling yankees . 
  you may have won the battle , but you will never win the war !, 
  we 'll get you next time latvia , mark my words !, 
  they actually [ did !,

  no wonder you guys are good at football . 
  if i were , i would n't call you an idiot . 
  that south park episode was horrible and you should be ashamed for even referencing it . 
  congratulations for the 4th place in eurobasket . 
  sincerly , lithuania . 
  i do n't know , just thought i 'll point out that the muslim invasion of europe has begun . 
  i 'm helping your cause by linking articles of past events which are irrelevant . 
  is n't this what you 're doing ? 
  indeed . 
  what the fuck . 
  muslims [ invaded ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/umayyad_conquest_of_hispania ) spain already , europe is next !, 
  that 's what i thought too . 
  i remember marlboro gold in the uk a few years ago cost around 7.20 . 
  i just googled and holy shit , they cost over 9 quid now . 
  and 41 hesburger 's !, 
  after a friday ? 
  vodka is the best cure for a hangover !, 
  i 'm also okay with immigrants coming to our country , but with one condition - set up your kebab shops and restaurants . 
  seriously , middle-eastern food is amazing . 
  our kebabs suck . 
  heck , our food culture sucks . 
  i need some shwarma 4-5 am in the morning when i am drunk . 
  it 's godly . 
  lithuania also had a [ 19 year old ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romas_kalanta ) immolate himself in 1972 . 
  small question - what do the authorities do with situations like these ? 
  if a riot like this broke out , the police should do all their best to subdue the riot and arrest anyone who is breaking the law . 
  because those are refugees , they are turning a blind eye ? 
  is it that difficult to keep the situation peaceful ? 
  or are they afraid of turning this in to an even bigger riot ? 
  it does n't matter if you are a local or a refugee . 
  the law is the law . 
  peace should be maintained . 
  see someone behaving violently ? 
  arrest that person and deport him asap . 
  the person in question is resisting or poses a threat to the officer ? 
  bring out the bigger guns . 
  heck , a friend of mine has trouble travelling ( and been rejected on a few occasions ) because of his criminal record ( pathetic non-violent crime ) and yet , these people are getting a free pass ? 
  edit : just wanted to point out that i am not against refugees . 
  a lot of these people are educated . 
  syria before the civil war was n't a hell hole that we imagine it to be .
