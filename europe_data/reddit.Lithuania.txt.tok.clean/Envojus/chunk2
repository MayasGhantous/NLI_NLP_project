  heck , it was quite western . 
  they deserve a chance . 
  but only if they try - there are a lot of opportunities for them to come here legally . 
  but actions like these ca n't be tolerated . 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( http://allthingsd.com/files/2012/02/you_dont_say.png ), 
  i 'm lithuanian and i still prefer k\u00f6nigsberg :(, 
   but driving on the left is the ** right ** way to do it :( why sweden why . 
  deep inside of you , you know driving on the right is the right thing to do !, 
  heck , on escalator , which side are you standing to let people pass ? 
  left or right ? 
  butt-hair butt , round booty butt , tripple mutant butt ? 
  not that there is much of a difference between those cities , ca n't blame me !, 
  lithuania : vilnius - poles and hipsters kaunas - chavs and right-wing conservatives . 
  everyone hates this city , and for a good reason . 
  klaipeda - russians and lithuanians whose every fourth word or so is russian . 
  you . 
  rug . 
  this rug . 
  buy . 
  cheap . 
  rug buy . 
  now . 
  i would n't really call asahi or kirin ichban japanese beer . 
  you did n't really talk about the drinking culture of lithuania a lot so i will add . 
  `` domestic '' drinking is really popular in lithuania . 
  a lot of people , especially if they are skint of cash , like to gather in a flat and drink . 
  it depends on the occasion . 
  if it 's watching basketball ( foodball is getting popular ) , it 's usually beer with crisps . 
  if it 's a party , people usually bring their own drinks , but a lot of the times , booze ends early . 
  and since selling alcohol is illegal after 10 pm . 
  in supermarkets , people go to `` off-licenses '' , makeshift bars where they grab whatever they want ( usually vodka ) , the `` bartender '' opens the bottle and closes her eyes when you leave . 
  however , if you have some extra cash , you will pre-drink before going out to bars or clubs . 
  beer is becoming really popular between young people and the recent surge in variety of microbreweries is evident of that . 
  older people look at young people with amazement . 
  heck , older people ca n't comprehend how you can have a party without vodka . 
  there 's even a russian people which is popular here - `` beer without vodka is wasted money '' . 
  in clubs , people drink whatever they want . 
  the drinking culture is n't that different from western countries when going out . 
  well , maybe you should have read the arti ... * looks at the name * oh ... 
   bielefeld can someone explain me this joke ? 
  i am out of the loop here . 
  it translates to `` it 's good for good men to drink good kvass in a good forest '' . 
  here 's the [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdne87rtsnk ) by vytautas kernagis which popularized the phrase . 
  0:36 for the phrase in particular . 
  you mean fascist minorities . 
  the ~ ~ grand ~ ~ dank duchy of rastathianians . 
  back in the day , that was the norm . 
  if you look at all the countries near the equator , spicy food dominates . 
  the reason ? 
  spices are amazing as preservatives and with so abundant spices readily growing around you , it would be foolish not to . 
  and kurwa is quite popular too . 
  i will get a lot of flak about it from other lithuanians , but russian curse words are probably the best thing russians brought to lithuania . 
  unlike russian curse words , lithuanian ones lack emotion and finese to them . 
  cursing in lithuanian feels awkward and off . 
  just hit a door with your small toe ? 
  do n't worry , just yell `` suka , kurwa , nahuj , blet '' and all your pain just disappears . 
  you ca n't really do that in lithuanian . 
  nick jonas ? 
  obama ? 
  taylor swift ? 
  instead of delaying the invasion , that would just rush it . 
  when i was in spain , i have noticed that people smile at each other and do this weird thing - they talk to people they do n't know in public !, 
  and the weirdest thing is ... they were not drunk and were n't looking for trouble !, 
  and it was happening everywhere !, 
  it 's such a weird and bizarre tradition , but it truly felt like a festive day !, 
  i was in berlin a few weeks ago and i laughed out loud when i saw someone write `` free palestine '' in the middle of the star of david . 
  and then , someone else fixed it to `` freak palestine '' . 
  i wonder if that 's the graffiti the article is referring to . 
   lazy , illiterate , entitled , backward people in these god 's forgoten lands . 
  weird , that 's what my boss thinks about lithuanians when i moved to the uk . 
  well , that and alcoholic . 
  the [ website ] ( http://chisinau-hotel.md/ ) is cute though . 
  it 's like visiting your granny - not modern , but clean , warm and relaxing !, 
  belgium and netherlands should unite . 
  with drugs , whores beer and waffles , there 's nothing which can stop 'em . 
  it means `` to make it short '' . 
  were in prominent display . 
  these are the green bridge statues the article is talking about . 
  they were finally removed last week . 
   `` even had ** real ** weed in it '' ** ftfy **, 
  oh swedes , you and your political correctness . 
  nope . 
  these are russian speaking russians with a lithuanian citizenship . 
  that 's about it . 
  nope . 
  it 's white rus . 
  here 's a [ link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_russia ) from wikipedia . 
  you sure they would n't just shoot the shoplifters in the us ? 
  i like that . 
  going to steal that from you . 
  of course not , because homosexuality was considered the norm in ancient greece . 
  something which is no longer the case thanks to religion . 
  so you think that if lgbt parades did n't exist , the government would just one day wake up and say `` hey , you know gay people exist ? 
  let 's allow them to get married ! '' . 
  it 's a way of showing `` hey , there 's a problem in our society , and we have to get your attention ! '' . 
  in countries where gay marriage is legal these parades celebrates it 's victory . 
  and i do n't see anything wrong with having 1 day of the year when you can celebrate . 
  and how does that picture increase the hate ? 
  i do n't know , but the children look pretty happy .
