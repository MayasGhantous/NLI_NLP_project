  so do the people . 
  anti-lgbt people have this weird image in their head that all gay pride parades are just dudes parading in their underwear . 
  sure , it exists , but you are just focusing on a small part . 
  a small part which captures your attention . 
  why focus on the 1 % when 99 % of the people attending these events look and act normal . 
  give me some ideas on how to push for civil unions without pride parades ? 
  how will you let the government and people know that lgbt people exist ? 
  that they are unhappy ? 
  that they are discriminated ? 
  how will you get the medias attention ? 
  if you have some ideas , i will gladly take them , because we really need more of them . 
  i am left handed and i do n't feel discriminated . 
  there is no low which says that left-handed scissors are banned since being right handed is superior . 
  sure , being right handed has its advantages , but i am allowed to work around it . 
  in addition to me being left-handed , i am bisexual . 
  and the law clearly states in lithuania that i can not marry a member of the same sex . 
  sure , i can rent out a flat with my partner and live with him , but what about mortgages ? 
  what if i die in an accident ? 
  what happens to my house ? 
  if i do n't leave a will , the house is left to my family which i disowned . 
  my partner has no right to my house . 
  how is that fair ? 
  and yet they all share the same thing - discrimination . 
  yep , just like how the women 's and the african-american civil rights movements . 
  they were there to piss people off , obviously . 
  and i am pretty sure the same goes for us baltics . 
  we can in to noridc !, 
  i bet the bear is cruising before heading off to amsterdam . 
  i am kr\u00f5\u00f5t !, 
  at least latvia has a few mountains :( . 
  so many years have passed and berliners still wear the same clothes and haircuts . 
  spotted the tory . 
  you know , with putin nowhere to be seen for a week , a major announcement coming from kremlin in the next few days , lithuania reintroducing drafting , huge us military convoys heading towards romania , us tanks in the baltics . 
  there 's a reason to be paranoid . 
  i ca n't wait until america starts dropping mcdonalds to deliver freedom . 
  damn you comcast !, 
  i do n't know , i would love the chance to be with michelangelo . 
  he 's the [ hottest ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0fy4_ucjmyq/hqdefault.jpg ) turtle from my childhood . 
  i love how their most common response is `` i need beer with this ! '' . 
  lithuanian food is n't the best . 
  a lot of it actually sucks but we love it cause we grew up with it . 
  but our beer snack culture is amazing . 
  fried rye bread with mayonnaise and cheese is soooo good with beer . 
  i do n't know a single foreign person who tried it and did n't love it . 
  heck , i have so many british friends now whom i introduced it to and make it themselves !, 
  i 'd say that georgia is above of poland , ukraine and belarus . 
  it 's easy . 
  when you are desperate to leave , you are n't lookign for arguments against leaving . 
  you open wikipedia and what do you see ? 
  germany has a high standard of living . 
  the gdp is great . 
  the average salary does n't even compare to yours . 
  freedom or religion . 
  freedom of movement . 
  media liberty . 
  add some long-distance family members who live in europe and owns a nice house , drives a nice car and their kid is studying in america . 
  oh , and also the movies !, 
  everyone in europe dresses well , there are massive castles and renaissance era buildings at every corner . 
  watch mission impossible and you get the impression that europeans do n't do anything but just sit at bars and cafes , relaxing . 
  you start comparing all these things with your own country and realize that europe is amazing . 
  no wars . 
  prosperity . 
  freedom . 
  the land of opportunity . 
  we take these things for granted , but for people from poverty and war torn countries europe looks like a paradise . 
  this . 
  freshmen at lithuanian universities have to learn `` proper '' lithuanian . 
  this includes how to stress words correctly , learn when international words are okay and when they are bad ( rinkodara for marketing for example ) . 
  some words in general should n't be used like skuduras . 
  even if you are from a major city , that can be a lot of useless information to take in . 
  i ca n't imagine what it 's like if you are from a smaller town or village . 
  could you give me the link for it ? 
  nutritional information for lithuanian products is a bitch . 
  if i did n't know english , i would have guessed you were english . 
  that may be due to the accent , since at some times , it sounds very british . 
  i never said they were lithuanians . 
  they are a subset of jews , that 's what the op was asking for . 
  [ crimean karaites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_karaites ) in lithuania , living in trakai and surounding areas . 
  legend says that the grand duke vytautas took these mercenaries in to his royal guard and reloacated them and their families . 
  they were allowed to practice their religion , speak in their mothers tongue and uphold their traditions . 
  they still live next to trakai castle ( which was the capital of the grand duchy of lithuania ) and make amazing pastries called [ kibinai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_karaites#/media/file:kibinai.jpg ), 
  i too play cities skylines . 
  i would n't count on that . 
  the liberal movement is becoming a bigger party every election . 
  and i expect it to become even larger in the future as the party particularly appeals to young voters which are becoming increasingly important while populist parties such as labour are losing traction . 
  homeland union realized this - why do you think gabrielius landsbergis became the leader ? 
  edit : word . 
  and what about russia ? 
  russia seems pretty right wing at the moment and they own most of the worlds resources ? 
  you ca n't attribute scandinavia 's success only to oil . 
  sweden , denmark and finland do n't have that much oil and yet are a great example . 
  it seems like bulgaria is the texas of europe . 
  i actually had a friend who did that when i was studying in the uk . 
  he was the only one to get laid every night * sighs *, 
  bitch please !,
