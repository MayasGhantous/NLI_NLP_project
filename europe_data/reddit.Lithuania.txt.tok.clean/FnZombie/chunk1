not gay enough into nordic ? 
  no no , you got it wrong . 
  russia is doing bad things because it 's usa 's fault . 
  so a dictatorship is morally right as long as a country can function properly ? 
  `` power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely . '', 
  is germany better off now than before hitler died ? 
  da fak is this fked up logic ?!, 
  it 's better to lose all your rights to one person who 'll rule as long as he wishes and he 'll destroy any opposition and criticism of his rule whille getting rich by exploiting the country than to have all of your rights , but have a incompetent goverment , that you can change later by democratic elections ? 
  umm ... was n't ukraine 's allies russia and belarus ? 
  what allies are you talking about ? 
  australians, 
  it 's even more interesting that there has always been negative news like this about russia . 
  oh , thanks !, 
  what are these elections in dumbass all about ? 
  i got excited when i saw a guy dressed as vytautas didysis  . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  common logic and facts are the law here . 
  being an edgy `` do n't believe what the media is showing '' conspiracy theorist and being ignorant to things that have been happening for months now is frowned uppon . 
  damned ukrainians sending their troops into russia 's soil and starting a war , annexing territories , supporting terrorist organisations , terrorising countries with it 's natural resources , pretending to be a world superpower and re electing exkgb new age hitler who does n't care one bit about human rights or in country 's right to self-determination . 
  clearly russia has the moral high ground here . 
  sure , [ here it is ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2kvkid/one_condition/ ), 
  lol no , and lesbian sex is allowed too . 
  ( but only if girls are bisexual ), 
  russia can feel guilt ? 
  we do like you, 
  and how would you have peace with palestine while being bombarded with rockets from their side ? 
  how does one reason with extremists ? 
  why usa does n't make peace with isis ? 
  why are you writing city names and our country 's name ? 
  are you planing on doing something ? 
   .  edit : it 's a joke , people . 
  there was no socialism from the start . 
  soviet union and china were not socialist states , but `` asian despotism '' states . 
  `` october `` revolution '' '' was actually a contrerevolution to elected socialist government . 
  even bolseviks stoped calling themselves as `` socialists '' , but rather `` communists '' . 
  they broke every socialism 's rule ( main one being that you ca n't skip socialism evolution 's steps . 
  lenin and his gang tried to skip `` capitalism '' and move from pseudo-feudalism to socialism ) . 
  more on this read mensevik ( lenin 's old friends ) , trocki 's and european socialist works . 
  they were clearly on vacation . 
  i like that a lot of them have dash cams . 
  mhm ... some countries still have kings and queens . 
  so what would that be in english ? 
  great-russian-ness ? 
  keep in mind that russia considers it self as third roman empire with it 's citizens `` great russians '' ( \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u044b / velikorossy ) . 
  it 's an important aspect that sheds some light on why some russians think they are so mighty and can do whatever they want . 
  we have a term for it `` did\u017eiarusi\u0161kumas '' ( could n't find an english term , sorry ) . 
  all the kurwas went to rulling party and it 's close people ? 
  it 's the trakai island castle, 
  no , commonwealth was great . 
  halloween was never big in lithuania too . 
  we have pagan v\u0117lin\u0117s and catholic vis\u0173 \u0161vent\u0173j\u0173 diena ( all saints ' day ) on our hands to commemorate already . 
  not only did he end a person 's life , but he also traumatized other 3-4 students ... 
  sometime in the future . 
  you do n't see any male officers at the end , they probably went to relieve stress ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  it 's hard to run with a rocket in your pocket . 
  russia does n't understand that not everyone is into bdsm . 
  oh wow this all over again ... 
  i 've argued enough about this already . 
  here 's a [ nice video ] ( http://youtu.be/802dqaig0ws ) to watch after you done fapping to pilsudski portrait , maybe you 'll stop seeing lithuanians as polishphobes which [ we are not ] ( http://youtu.be/d2silxn2ugu ) , acknowledge that poland was n't saint during those times and your country 's part in ruining our relationship too and also understand our point of view . 
  i personally do n't wish to anger any polak because of common history and statehood . 
  if \u017de\u010dpospolita had n't been divided by foreign powers , these conflicts probably would have never happened in the first place . 
  thank you . 
  we took back what was our after certain country at first acknowledged that vilnius was ours and then broke a certain agreement and by doing this forever ruined our relanshionship . 
  to this day it 's citizens on reddit unsenceraly remind us about this sensitive topic rather than moving on . 
  nah , we were drinking wodka with polish and ruthenians , while latvia was partying with germans and fins . 
  thanks for encouragement , but we 're not interested in foreign lands like our neighbours from south and east . 
  why would i ? 
  san francisco was n't our capital for hundreds of years . 
  and has no significant historical importance . 
  i 'd like more of these . 
  arguing with nationalistic polak with vague understanding of history and justifying everything wrong what his country did is the same as hitting my head into a wall multiple times . 
  but at least i got to know the other perspective regarding history . 
  i wo n't continue this anymore . 
  now you 're just obviously hating lithuanians . 
  how about our neighbors do n't interfere in our internal affairs ? 
  and what are these basic minority rights that we are denying in our country ? 
  or do you mean `` privileges '' regarding other minorities ? 
   and grand duchy of lithuania was estabilished when ? 
  12th century ? 
  13th century ? 
  how it was relevant to the situation in the city and area around it in early 20th century ? 
  could italy claim london because roman empire held it for few centuries ? 
  how could poland claim vilnius as it 's own because of former \u017de\u010dpospolitians living in it ? 
  will i get a polish passport , because my last name has a lithuanian nobility / polish origin ? 
  can usa annex my country because i speak english ? 
  was it right for nazi germany to annex sudetenland and austria because of their language ? 
   it was n't your capital city . 
  it was the capital city of the grand duchy of lithuania , a part of the commonwealth over a hundred years earlier , and the only thing it had in common with the new `` lithuanian '' nation state was its name . 
  but it always has been except those ~ 19 years when poland had it . 
  it was the capital city of grand duchy of lithuania , still is the capital of lithuania and always will be . 
  regarding other things you said , the same thing could be said about poland . 
   has russia lost crimea in january 2014 or in 1954 ? 
  because if the former was true , then your analogy would bear some resemblance of truth . 
  oh but it 's relevant . 
   or rather let 's secure the important centre of polish culture inhabited mostly by poles , which is also claimed ( on a very weak basis ) by our `` brothers '' . 
  centre of polish culture ? 
  that 's a new one . 
   the friendship was broken much earlier , during the russian occupation in 19th century , when lithuanians started treating poles living in areas of the grand duchy as `` lithuanians , who think who are poles '' ( this kind of thinking is very prevalent in your country , i saw examples of it even in this very thread ) . 
  no wonder our relations deteriorated with such attitude from you . 
  19th century was time of national revival .
