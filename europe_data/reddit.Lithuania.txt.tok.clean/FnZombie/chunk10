  but that could be one of the possible theories . 
  in lithuania , they are called `` baltarusiai '' or `` gudai '' and their country as `` baltarusija '' or `` gudija '' . 
  direct translation : k\u0105 tu ten kalbi , tu i\u0161kreiptas ridike !, 
  genitive case ( possessive case ) of word `` baltija '' . 
  for example `` baltijos j\u016bra '' - `` baltic sea '' . 
  in this case it 's a brand name , `` baltijos alus '' - `` baltic beer '' . 
  because `` baltaodis '' and `` juodaodis '' has the same meaning as `` white male '' and `` black male '' . 
  ( for female : `` baltaod\u0117 '' - `` white female '' ; `` juodaod\u0117 '' - `` black female '' ), 
   i noticed several times that people ( in eastern europe especially ) think their countries have no connections to colonial history . 
  to me colonial history is actually about possesing colonies and enslaving the local population , not about having a few black servants and wanting to `` make yourself look more african '' . 
  feels like grasping at straws here . 
  interesting trivia nonetheless . 
  socialdemocrats , former communists , are discussing civil partnership with the church ... 
  there were some self taken photos like the one in the vehicle, 
  how can you be closed to opposition if opposition eats cyanide and gets shot by chechens for supporting charlie hebdo ? 
   the only thing that would stop them would be to send them all back , so they know that it 's pointless to come here . 
  or going back to good old classic democracy with slavery ^ ^ / jk, 
  pick up that can, 
  this was hilarious . 
  thank 's for posting the satire . 
  can the united nations general assembly provide me information about `` soldiers shooting each other '' in crimea and not try to weasel out by shifting topic more and more ? 
   if a country or region is occupied by another ** without ** ** consent ** , it is at war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014 as much as i hate it that russia broke international law to annex a territory , it does n't change the fact that crimea is de facto part of russia now . 
  if ukraine tried to get it back by force that would mean an official war . 
  now back to :  crimea not at war ? 
  then what do you call soldiers shooting each other ? 
   i am aware they are nato members and they can request support . 
  they can not request troops . 
  re-read the north atlantic treaty . 
  may i ask you to cite the part where nato members are prohibited from requesting troops ? 
   so , you recognise the annexation ? 
  are you changing the topic from your claim that there is war in crimea ? 
   because saying there is no war there is like saying there was no wwii in poland after the germans annexed it . 
  now you 're mixing up occupation with war actions/military conflict . 
   you are aware that since 1990 , kaliningrad actually is russian territory kalingrad was part of russian sfsr since 1945 . 
  are you aware that baltics are nato countries and can request troops from their allies if needed ? 
  i find it interesting that eu institutions do n't see any discrimination regarding this . 
  then provide me source for that . 
  donestk and luhansk are n't in crimea , dude , that would mean there is war in russian federation lol . 
  what you wrote imo was true decades ago . 
  i have a really hard time imagining a future scenario where tanks will be used for land warfare especially because of the rise of drones and we know that tanks are extremely vulnerable to air attacks , even a group of people or one person can take out a tank with a missile . 
  ofc , tanks can be used effectively for invading third world countries that do not posses modern anti-tank equipment ... 
  i do n't see current tanks as viable investment for the future , but that 's my oppinion . 
   where exactly is crimea ? 
  is it not eastern ukraine ? 
  i never said there was a war in russia , i said it was in crimea . 
  last time i looked at a map , it was right there . 
  last time i checked it was de facto russian after the annexation . 
  coming from a country not sharing border with russia . 
  sending iskander missiles to kalingrad was cuban missile crisis 2.0 . 
  army of invaders ? 
  or armies with tanks from 20th century ? 
  i see reports about war in eastern ukraine , no mentioning of war in russia . 
  there 's an internal struggle in crimean peninsula ? 
   crimea not at war ? 
  then what do you call soldiers shooting each other ? 
  source ? 
   so , one threat about a region already at war crimea is n't at war , neither is baltic region . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-threatens-to-use-nuclear-force-over-crimea-and-the-baltic-states-10150565.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11106195/putin-privately-threatened-to-invade-poland-romania-and-the-baltic-states.html, 
  tanks are metal caskets in modern warfare . 
  i 'd rather buy drones or anti-tank weaponry for defense . 
  that 's reassuring, 
  you accidentally wandered away from / r/russia , traveler . 
  my memory deceived me . 
  apparently that pipe cost 99 500 litas . 
  you know what they say `` trust nobody , not even yourself '' : /, 
  it was called `` language of interethnic communication '' . 
  tomato * tomato * . 
  what purpose ? 
  what was the official language in all of the states , who 's history had to learn all the member states and where was the political center from which all the commands came ? 
  [ we lost 99 500 litas ( ~ 28 817 $ ) for this fluxus art statue ] ( http://www.respublika.lt/uploads/img/catalog/1/photo_for_gallery_1_65061095.jpg ) edit : sorry , people , i inflated the price . 
  it 's fixed now . 
   they should give kalingrad/k \u00f6nigsberg to germany , poland or latvia . 
  pff , they should give it to finland, 
  hopefully in next century you 'll get a liberal and not so short-sighted leader & government and redeem yourself like germany did so we wo n't oppose each other ;-), 
  hipsters seeking attention ? 
  please do n't group us as baltics when the other two states are n't relevant to the discussion , thanks . 
   the region had nothing to do with the baltics for a thousand years http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuania_minor http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_lithuanians, 
  i love how kremlin trolls complain that exsu countries should n't spend money on defense and that they are paranoid and hysterical when moscow itself spreads propaganda about nato countries preparing to attack them . 
  maybe some russian national bolshevists and neo-nazis do, 
  finnish welfare state model ^ ^ and ^ the ^ money ^ for ^ it, 
  i understood paulusmagintie 's reply more in line as `` defending and then pushing the enemy back ( offensive ) '' . 
  and we both know that during interwar poland won against bolsheviks . 
  just because of my flair you do n't have to think that i am attacking you or your country . 
   they have n't been an offensive type country since the poland-lithuania empire . 
  [ op 's argument was simply not true ] ( http://wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_poland_%281918\u201339%29 ) , there were a lot of military conflicts like , for example , the polish-russian war , other military offenses and etc. 
  see interwar poland, 
  why is n't it `` kozoswki '' `` kozawski '' or `` kozaski ? 
  long journey / s, 
   kazlauskas - may denote a person from a town whose name derives from the polish for goat . 
  it 's probably belorussian since `` goat '' - `` kaziol / \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0451\u043b '' , back in gdl times chancellery language was the old church slavonic ( lithuanian written form was not created yet , it was only a spoken language ) and last names were slavicised when written so `` o\u017eelis '' ( o\u017eis / o\u017eka - goat ) became `` kazlauskas '' . 
  and that 's how the nordic dream died, 
  if usa invaded any european country there would be hate for it too . 
  it was more like a rhetorical question . 
  but yeah , there are not enough polish-lithuanians in poland and therefore it 's not worth learning lithuanian for professors as a secondary language for that . 
  i meant learning all the subjects ( geography , history , physics etc ) in polish language and even getting university degree . 
  can i get education and university degrees in poland in lithuanian language without ever learning polish ? 
   what kind of privillages you can learn everything in polish from elementary school till university . 
  i do n't know any other country where you can get polish education in other country than in poland . 
   teachers are protesting becouse lithuanian gov is closing schools a lot of schools are being closed because of lack of funding . 
  it 's not specific to polish schools .
