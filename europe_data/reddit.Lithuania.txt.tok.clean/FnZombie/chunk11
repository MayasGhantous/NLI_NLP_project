  the government does n't have money to fund all the schools and raise wages for teachers . 
  basically teachers in lithuania are getting payed minimum wages ( policemen and firemen too ) . 
  there are a lot of protests every year , but nothing changes . 
   lithuania is not making their lives easier neither are we making it worse . 
  polish minority has privileges which other minorities do n't have in lithuania . 
  the only thing missing is `` polish street names and personal documents in polish '' and it would basically be the same as living in poland for them . 
  belgium is n't a nation state like estonia , so i would n't know . 
   denying citizenship to people born and raised in a country who 's denying citizenship to people ? 
  just pass the easy language and citizenship test and you have it . 
  here in lithuania we hate each other except when it comes to basketball , eurovision or other competition against foreigners . 
  because certain groups of people are bad not because of their ethnicity/race , but because of their cultural background . 
  i believe that people in general agree that for example ghetto culture is shit ? 
  me too : a  \u0104 c  \u010c e  \u0116 , \u0118 i  y , \u012e u  \u0172 , \u016a s  \u0160 z  \u017d, 
  i would love the / r/smite design p.s. 
  sorry for shitty video game subreddit , but really like the design, 
  oops , yeah i meant that , thanks , 
  france and germany are now part of northern europe . 
  also ,  finland is almost completely white , perhaps explaining the high level of negativity towards black people ( 20 % have a negative impression ) amazing conclusion - `` if you 're white - you 're perhaps racist '' ^ ^ ^ ^ clap ^ ^ ^ ^ clap . 
  and 20 % is n't that high like the article wants you to believe . 
  russia prides itself as euroasian, 
  russia is considered to be part of europe but turkey and cyprus are not . 
  caucasus in general has long history of conflict and their current leader is a warlord . 
  if for example a chechen says that he 'll kill you , he 's not joking , he will try to kill you . 
  with neighbors like that the opposite would be better . 
  i do n't know how much you 're familiar with lithuanian-russian history . 
  always look on the bright side !, 
   the 1968 invasion by soviet troops of czechoslovakia has had a revision on russian tv claiming they were there to stop nato overthrowing the government so it would be okay for nato to stop `` rebels '' in eastern ukraine overthrowing the government ? 
  i just got used to alt + shift and then pressing @ button long ago . 
  it 's an old habit . 
   [ axaxaxa , just another proofs that crimea belongs to russia ] ( https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1416/17/1416178917267.png ) ftfy, 
  the symbol '' @ '' is pictured on our keyboard key , but we actually have to change our input language to en to be able to type '' @ '' and `` 2 '' , since lt input types the letter '' \u010d '' and it 's capital form - '' \u010c '' . 
  but then some politician will tweet a mean message , say something or support someone that according to them you should n't - they will ban your products one day because of reasons they made up and it will hit your business if they rely heavily on exports to russia . 
  you 're arguing with a notorious lithuanian-hater and possibly a polish nationalist on this subreddit . 
  the guy believes that polish is some kind of a high culture and former plc nations have no cultural heritage of their own or are inferior to polish one , that 's why everything must come from them and he wo n't miss the chance to declare something without source in the comments and then will dismiss your facts when proven wrong . 
  it 's like discussing with a wall basically unless you share his view . 
  not only did you not read the article but you also left out a lot of ex-communist states . 
  give them a break , they really really wanted into western-homogay and eu before . 
  the difference would be that we would lose part of our sovereignty for 0 gain since cons would outweigh the pros . 
  forming a commonpoor country with latvia would be more realistic anyway . 
  you 'll either find someone who can speak english or russian , so that would n't be a problem for you . 
  with poland it would be `` commonpoor '', 
  yes , military untrained miners experienced in war tactics and heavy machinery without the help from any foreign mercenaries are fighting ukrainian army for so long , managing to reclaim territories and increase their miner numbers after every humanitarian aid from russia . 
  brazilian communist together with serbian fascists fighting ukrainian `` fascists '' and against kiev 's `` imperialism '' in their own country . 
  also , serbians helping their orthodox brothers fight their orthodox brothers . 
  basically , brain dead mercenaries fighting for money . 
  i do n't support illegal land grabs of any kind . 
  as a lithuanian it sadens me what has happened to east prussia since prussian-lithuanians/lietuvininkai made an important contribution to lithuanian culture as a whole . 
  the very first book printed in lithuanian language was in k\u00f6nigsberg . 
  kaliningrad should belong to germany . 
  well it can only grow when there 's almost none of it, 
  as unofficial oblast of russia, 
   did they have proof of the robbing and beating or is this just the old lady 's word ? 
  no , the police just arrests everyone without any reason to / s  now those gypsy kids will have even more of a reason to trust and love the police !, 
  / s implying that they would have ever obeyed the law in the first place, 
  [ here 's a homemade one that i stole from facebook ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/q81/s720x720/10606538_859081157495285_5306454856403500806_n.jpg?oh=b71c062f46b11174ed9ffc096e9e8886&amp;oe=55b4342f&amp;__gda__=1433652025_40856ddf7b187040a78aa66b3c13f897 ), 
  do you have any particular incident on your mind ? 
  did they mix up latvia with lithuania in the first graph ? 
  or does latvia have their own lng terminal or something ? 
  context : lithuanian centre for human rights ( lietuvos \u017emogaus teisi\u0173 centras ) conducted a social experiment wanting to see how lithuanian participants would react when they 'd be asked to translate a racist message . 
  none of the participants knew about the experiment before hand , believing that they were participating in a audition for a commercial . 
  i remember having national revival activist portraits hanging on the wall of lithuanian language classroom and presidents of lithuania portraits in history classes , but i do n't know if that 's common or if that was something unique to my gymnasium . 
   rubble damn auto-correct, 
  my grandmother managed to adjust to all of them which i find impressive . 
  indifferent, 
  younger ones do n't since english replaced russian as lingua franca . 
  i do n't know about latvia though . 
  could n't be farther from the truth . 
  forest brothers targeted local communist activists , officials and soviet sympathizers no matter what ethnicity they were . 
  that 's nothing . 
  check how many polish meps voted against it, 
  dmitriy medvedev iii the false - of putin dynasty, 
  `` neutral '' country they say . 
  source on baltics celebrating nazis ? 
  what will you pull out of your ass ? 
  an rt video about latvia ? 
  i 'm scared to imagine how worse it could be if we stayed brrr ... 
  i would n't invest in country if it threatened me, 
  greece has n't been invaded and ukraine has n't suddenly changed it 's mind about loan repayment after agreeing on it 's conditions or threaten eu with flooding immigrants to be honest , 
  how ? 
  we were before, 
  we are second in the world by suicides rates ( [ per 100 000 people per year ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate_ ) ), 
  i would argue that poland had insignificant influence on us before the formation of the commonwealth compared to ruthenians with whom we share longer history , who were christian orthodox and who 's writing ( old church slavonic ) was adopted in lithuanian court . 
  most important factor to adopt catholicism was to prevent attacks from teutons and livonians . 
  are there any beret vending machines ? 
  what is this baltic language you speak of ? 
  it 's so cute, 
  no problem, 
  that 's nerkuras 's words not herodude60 's, 
   his 5 words seemed pretty accurate to me . 
  five words you say ? 
   finland calling we want our stuff back . 
  baltics calling , it 's time go back home from your nordic friends house-party, 
  it would be a comedy sitcom about law abiding politicians + they 'd put a chechen or a uzbek as a comedic relief character . 
  gives a new meaning to `` putinbot '', 
  i expected poland to be above average but sadly i was disappointed, 
  since eurovision is a political show and winners are already determined there of course exceptions like this, 
   if they could n't hold onto their empire then , what makes you think it will work now ? 
  * soviet union collapsed because of 2 reasons : 1 . 
  planned economy model did n't work ; 2 . 
  many nations were incorporated forcibly against their will and history shows that all empires without consensus collapse eventually .
