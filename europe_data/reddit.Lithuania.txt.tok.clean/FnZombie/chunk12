  after soviet union collapse all the countries that joined it willfully or could n't set themselves free were incorporated into commonwealth of independent states which now has transformed to eurasian economic community ( copy of eu ) . 
  * russia was humiliated by the ssrs collapse and it 's population wants to feel strong and powerful again and putin did just that by grabbing crimea - check his popularity for yourself . 
  democracy is a curse word for them since the 90s democracy brought another \u0421\u043c\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f ( trouble times - reoccurring event in russian history ) , at that time there was a popular saying `` democracy - ** dermo ** cracy ( shit-mocracy ) . 
   ffs their population is shrinking quicker than that of western europe . 
  that is a very real limitation on their economy snd ability to wage war . 
  propaganda works wonders , russia is a country that never had a real democracy . 
  any russian leader will have it 's populations support no mater what he 'll do , usa will always be blamed for everything . 
  once russia secures land bridge to crimea - the war will be over . 
  `` you can not understand russia with your mind . 
  you ca n't measure it with universal dimensions . 
  russia has something special . 
  in russia you must simply believe . '', 
  - fyodor tyutchev ( 1803 -- 1873 ) . 
  it 's not for a westerner to understand russia . 
   russia is not the ussr but it 's doing a 180 \u00b0 back to it, 
  western leaders openly talk about supplying ukraine against the aggressor while the aggressor denies any involvement and continues business as usual . 
  ukrainian conflict is internal - between ukrainian troops and `` rebels '' who found a way to clone human soldiers and military equipment . 
  brought to you by russiatoday \u2122, 
  and you would be a russophile ? 
  russia will send troops and equipment as long as it takes to secure a land corridor all the way to crimea and even after that there will be a frozen conflict until russia establishes a puppet-state novorussia that will be annexed after another fake referendum with 90 % of voters voting for joining russia , furthermore russia will do anything to pressure ukraine to continue supplying water and electricity to the crimean peninsula until russians build a bridge and all the infrastructure needed for the region . 
  russia wins , conflict is over , ukraine is left in a horrible economical state and diplomats pat each other on the back . 
   preferably by closing the fuckers from both sides in a room until an agreement is needed how naive . 
  this war will go on till ukraine surrenders or putin decides to stop . 
  being homeless is a lifestyle in lithuania . 
  if you give them money - they 'll spend it on cigarettes and alcohol . 
  they like to pray on naive tourists in sidewalk cafes asking for money and they do routine beggings every few minutes even asking the same people for more money . 
  sometimes it 's impossible to get rid of them until somebody calls the police . 
  they abuse your genorosity as much as possible . 
  if you want to win eurovision 's nr 1 spot or at least get a high spot - you must sing in english . 
  slave wages , depressing weather , angry people to name a few ... 
   most of my contacts with lithuanians regarding this topic so far left me with an impression that this is approximately everything an average lithuanian `` knows '' about this conflict . 
  majority of common lithuanians know nothing about interwar vilnius region 's history or care about the capital city , other than that there is trakai castle in vilnius county and that 's the place where lithuania 's statehood began . 
   was is worth it so much ? 
  yes and no . 
   that 's why tomaszewski 's party is so pro-russian , they know they ca n't count on support from polish government at the start there was a huge support for eaopil from polish government until donald tusk visited local poles . 
  after that the support fell and polish government disassociated themselves from the group , probably because everyone figured who funded tomaszewski 's activity and for which third country polish-lithuanian conflict was beneficial . 
  all i remember is that it was way way way blown of proportion by lithuanian media with their click-bait style articles and news reports claiming something like `` arrogant nationalistic poles are interfering in lithuania 's internal politics '' , `` poles want to polonize lithuanians again '' , `` poland wants special treatment of polish minority in lithuania '' and polish media portraying lithuanians as anti-polish , banning polish from speaking their language in public and that you will get beaten or killed for being polish . 
   polish government which still wants to mantain good relations with lithuania , our nato and eu allies , despite immense ammounts of bad will on lithuanian side . 
  i fail to see any conflict between lithuania 's and poland 's governments . 
  to me it seems like the relations are better than they ever been since russia attacked ukraine . 
   `` evil poland out of the blue invaded purely lithuanian vilnius in 1920 :( ( '' . 
  that seems to be some kind of lithuanian dogma . 
  that 's what you believe  you should have thought about it before annexing areas with a polish majority and negligible ammounts of lithuanians lithuania refused repeated nazi germany 's offers for a joint attack on poland to capture vilnius . 
  after poland was divided and ceased to exist vilnius was given to us back by the soviet union in exchange for soviet military bases in our territory , which laid the foundation for future occupation and was our biggest mistake . 
   poland also completely ignored the lithuania dismantling the polish autonomical region 1991 in favour of good relations between our countries . 
  not because in favor of good relations between our countries , but because that was moscow 's project . 
  yedinstvo movement 's purpose was to keep lithuania in soviet union , the movement had the same opinion about poland too . 
  i 've seen people arguing with you multiple times before and i came to conclusion that you either love to argue/troll or you are a polish nationalist . 
  doing the same thing over and over again and thinking that something will change is waste of time . 
   polish minority case street signs and polish passports ? 
  `` electoral action of poles in lithuania '' party went silent after they gathered their votes from polish and russian voters and were elected to the parliament/government + waldemar became an eu mep . 
  apparently polish people 's party might have forgotten why they were voted for . 
  kudos to them for managing to gather the `` underdog '' votes . 
   history manipulations and justifications i would love to hear about this  < . .  imagined hate < . .  also the lithuanian nationalists , which in my opinion are even worse than russian one , they sympathize with nazis nationalist parties sympathizing with nazis ? 
  how unorthodox !, 
  polish neo-nazis probably sympathize with gandhi ? 
  could you give me an example of lithuanians doing something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vt50twh.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dlqxanu.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://www.sekunde.lt/media/2011/08/i%c5%a1niekintas-paminklas1m.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://gs.delfi.lt/images/pix/file48826643_c44c7597.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://gs.delfi.lt/images/pix/file48848308_78a04365.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://alkas.lt/wp-content/gallery/punske-isniekinti-lietuviski-uzrasai-2011/isniekinti-lietuviski-uzrasai-lenkijoje6.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://i1.alfi.lt/9315/70/91.png ) , [ this ] ( http://alkas.lt/wp-content/gallery/punske-isniekinti-lietuviski-uzrasai-2011/isniekinti-lietuviski-uzrasai-lenkijoje2.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://alkas.lt/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/sulenku-suniokotas-paminklas-punske.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/jtztxfjcqcs ) , and in the middle of [ vilnius ] ( http://youtu.be/pwae5z828bu ) ? 
   if lithuanians will not do something about the relations , some people will still live on hate in both side of the border , it ca n't be a one-side initiative . 
  are there any bad blood between lithuania and poland ? 
  no there is n't . 
  and what did poland do to improve relations ? 
   stop denying ponary massacre where did you get that ? 
   every country acted imperialistic in interwar period , but poland did n't attack ukraine , belarus , ** lithuania , because those countries did n't exist then ** . 
  < . .  ** then lithuania attacked us ** , wanting a city that had 90 % polish majority and ** had polish architecture ** , history , influence historical revisionism is strong with this one, 
  if you had higher suicide rates than ours there would n't be a ~ 1 million estonian population in your country tho,

  you win again , estonia . 
  our [ waldemar ] ( http://rojsty.blox.pl/resource/waldemar.jpg ) : (, 
  it 's illegal to hit a child in lithuania . 
  we have 3 different laws against it . 
  at least i thought that we were talking about nazi germany 's nazis and soviet union 's communists, 
  since i 'm very tired and probably that 's why i was left misunderstood , i want to clarify that i was not comparing socialism/socialist idealogies to nazism , but russian communism ( if you can call it that ) with nazism . 
  neither did russian communists advocate for worker control over the means of production , everything was ~ ~ owned ~ ~ under strict control by the ~ ~ state ~ ~ ruling party - that was extreme form of capitalism , there was no `` dictatorship of the proletariat '' but `` dictatorship for the proletariat '' , internationalism / `` revolution all around the world '' concept was used to hide/justify russian territorial expansion/imperialism ( in nazi germany that would be lebensraum concept ) , `` class consciousness '' was indeed advocated but only for lenin & co to gain power . 
  is n't socialism an umbrella term under which ( soviet ) communism falls ? 
  so socialist ( soviet communist / some say russian `` oriental despotism '' ) + cousins ( soviet union ) . 
  i wrote `` cousins '' and not `` brothers '' since they were similar in concepts but different like a bad mirror reflection . 
  ( ruling class - proletariat/aryan race ; destruction of opposition ; ethnic cleansing ; one party system ; promotion of internationalism/nationalism and etc ) . 
  i love when people assume people are stupid based on one comment ... do n't patronize me . 
  we were talking about nazi germany and soviet union 's idealogy . 
  [ read waz_met_jou comment for context . ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y0tbb/headsup_popular_neonazi_site_daily_stormer_is/cp5atwr ) . 
  sorry that i may have hurt your red-shirt feelings . 
  tell them what ? 
  how they took notes from their socialist cousins ? 
  exactly , they were the same black kettle, 
  ordinary sessions happen once a year + extraordinary sessions . 
  so at least once a year . 
  it 's easier for putin to lower it when his part of it, 
  as much as united nations, 
   do you really want to give russians a reason to look toward putin and to feel victimized they already only watch russian tv and overcompensate with their patriotism and loyalty to any russian president . 
   without citizenship they ca n't work inside the eu so their only choice in that regard is russia like they care about that at all , having non-citizen status has it 's own benefits that even citizens ca n't have . 
   whereas now if russians are being discriminated against and made unhappy under the states they live in they are not being descriminated against , simple rules apply to everyone equally disregarding their background . 
   and without a liberal group of family members who live in the west and get exposed to western culture then putinism has a greater chance to take hold . 
  from a personal experience , older homosovieticus members do n't give a shit what the younger members have to say . 
  soviet indoctrination was a huge success and even if soviet union does n't exist anymore these people still praise russia and everything that bad happens is the fault of usa . 
  russia 's compatriot program . 
  we have [ baltic assembly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_assembly ) which is benelux of baltics, 
  join nordic and leave us feeling lonely :(, 
   we were northern , until russia occupied us . 
  did i miss the part where russia moved whole lithuania to a different geographical location ? 
  and no i did n't assume you were stupid .
