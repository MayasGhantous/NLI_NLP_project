  no , only the ones being funded by russia or making pro-russian statements and policies . 
  [ nordic europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_countries ) and [ northern europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_europe ) are not the same thing . 
  is that ron perlman for lithuania ? 
  but estonia actually shares history and cultural ties with denmark and sweden the same way finland does . 
  decades if you count that economical experiment, 
   lithuanians have been taught that you are some kind of special in this subject sounds like inferiority complex  seriously ? 
  that 's what you think we are celebrating ? 
  i have n't been close to such lack of intelligence in a long time ... you 're vaguely referring to events/things that happened and do n't post any sources . 
  and you think i can guess what you 're thinking about . 
  i though you were referring to the august coup in russia after which soviet union 's dissolution happened . 
  to be honest , i have n't had a discussion with someone who does n't explain his argument or expands on it and does n't post sources for his claims , but instead throws insults left and right for long time . 
  insulting someone is ad hominem fallacy . 
  so what happened in 1991 august other than the coup that `` all three got full independent '' ? 
  please do n't say estonia 's declaration of independence , because lithuania and latvia could have been independent anyway . 
   i wrote declarations of sovereignty in bold so that you could understand the difference . 
  writing something in bold does n't make something `` understandable '' . 
  do you also scream estonian at foreigners so they could better understand you ? 
  what `` declarations of sovereignty '' ? 
  to what that refers ? 
  estonia 's declarations of sovereignty ? 
  apparently you 're not referring to lithuania 's and estonia 's declarations of independence which were mentioned by me in my post and to which you replied . 
  `` independence '' and `` sovereignty '' are synonyms . 
   declarations of sovereignty came from yet undemocratically elected parliaments . 
  i do n't know about estonia , but lithuania 's declaration of independence was made by democratically elected people . 
  an anti-communist independence movement - s\u0105j\u016bdis won a landslide victory in elections to the supreme soviet , members of s\u0105j\u016bdis proclaimed lithuania 's independence on 11 march 1990 , becoming the first soviet republic to do so . 
  [ here 's a report on the free elections in ( still ) soviet lithuania ] ( https://www.google.lt/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0ahukewjyw_aq_sdmahxjiiwkhxbtb4gqfgg2mam&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.csce.gov%2findex.cfm%3ffuseaction%3dfiles.download%26filestore_id%3d412&amp;usg=afqjcngorex_wq8fxmnkzpbxbi9fc6nf9g&amp;sig2=trrpef_thkvlkvslx76tdg&amp;bvm=bv.121099550,d.bgs&amp;cad=rja )  all three got full independent in august 1991 and that 's a fact . 
  all three baltic states wo n't celebrate a coup in russia, 
   though remember that all these declarations of sovereignty came from yet undemocratically elected parliaments . 
  in 1989 december , the communist party of lithuania seceded from the communist party of the soviet union and agreed to give up its monopoly on power . 
  the first free elections were held in february 1990 and s\u0105j\u016bdis representatives won an absolute majority ( 101 seats out of 141 ) in the supreme council of the lithuanian ssr . 
  vytautas landsbergis was elected chairman of the supreme council . 
  this led to the declaration of independence on march 11 , 1990 . 
   but it seems you really do n't know what you are talking about . 
  i suggest you reading up on the different declarations and the real situation on the ground in all three states . 
  sorry , i can not provide you with in-depth evidence that aligns with your world view . 
  you can read about the subject yourself or provide counterarguments . 
   it 's a little hilarious that you lithuanians keep bringing out that you were somehow first to become independent again . 
  first to actually declare independence and first to be recognized as independent lithuania : iceland first country to recognize the independence of lithuania in february 1991 estonia : iceland first country to recognize the independence of estonia in august 1991, 
  because you 're located near the baltic sea and your language belongs to the [ baltic finns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_finns ) branch of finno-ugric group . 
   it 's just that baltic peoples are only latvians and lithuanians as this is an ethnic group . 
  estonians are finnic . 
  the term `` balt '' was coined in the 19th century by the german linguist ferdinand nesselman to name one of the branches of the indo-european languages spoken on the eastern shores of the baltic sea . 
  the term stuck and nobody complains . 
  in a sense , were `` baltic balts '' . 
  imagine if south slavs were called `` balks '' , it would be the same situation . 
  other balkan countries like greek , albanians and romanians would complain that their not `` balks '' and they could n't into central europe . 
  the other name for balts could be used is `` aesti '' ( lithuanian : ais\u010diai ) , which possibly tacitus was referring to the prussian tribe , but some estonians claim it refers to them since `` aestii '' looks a lot like `` eesti '' . 
   estonia had declared sovereignty first in 1988 yet it was n't a declaration of complete independence from soviet union . 
  [ `` deputies to the estonian supreme soviet , the republic 's parliament , stressed that their concept of `` sovereignty '' for estonia is full autonomy for the republic within the soviet union . 
  they said they are willing to concede the conduct of foreign relations and national defense to moscow but little else . 
  '' ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-17/news/mn-458_1_soviet-union )  lithuania always seems to claim they were re-independent first somehow . 
  on 11 march 1990 , the supreme council of the republic of lithuania adopted an act on the restoration of an independent state of lithuania . 
  on august 20 , 1991 the estonian parliament issued a declaration of independence from the soviet union . 
   lithuania re-declared independence , estonia and latvia declared the soviet rule to have been illegal from the beginning and set out a period of transition towards full independence . 
  i do n't know what you are talking about . 
  all three baltic states declared soviet occupation illegal and re-declared their independences . 
  in august 1989 , the lithuanian soviet announced that the 1939 molotov-ribbentrop pact directly resulted in the baltics being forcibly incorporated into the ussr in 1940 . 
  only in lithuania 's case , there was no period of transition . 
   1991 was the one all three got full independence from the ussr . 
  this is the year the soviet union recognized the independence of the baltic states . 
  baltic states celebrate days of declaring their independence , not the day of soviet senpai realizing that it 's finally over , soviet empire ca n't do anything anymore . 
  it did n't mater if su would recognize us , the whole thing was illegal , su was dysfunctional and we had international backing . 
  i think we have to look between the lines to actually find out the truth, 
   lithuania : does n't like poland and if you type `` why poland ... '' in lithuanian google , the first result is `` why poland hates lithuania ? '' . 
  while in reality , nobody hates or gives a shit about each other . 
  cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , malta , slovakia and slovenia are in eurozone . 
  czech rep , poland and hungary are not . 
  it sounds even worse when you say `` previous decade '' , i still think about the 90s when people use that phrase . 
   polish minority is n't the problem it never was, 
  was too good to include, 
  if we to be believe statistics that were posted here long time ago , 40 % of poland hates everyone ( including poland ? 
   well to be honest i think the way the latvia and estonia treats russians, 
  baltics ca n't , nordics wo n't, 
   also , i did n't expect us to be more slavic than bulgarians or belarus to be 1/4 south slavic . 
  no idea how that happened . 
  bulgarians have slavic and turkic mix, 
  no idea what those symbols are, 
  so the whole being quiet and not hostily protesting against germany regarding the manditory quotas is finally paying out for us ? 
  ( sorry for mentioning refugees . 
  kinda offtopic ), 
   is it that easy to find a job in western europe if you are an eu citizen who does n't speak the language ? 
  where do you get the impression that eu citizens do n't speak the language of the country they emigrate to ? 
  they wo n't stay, 
   it 's because latvian is the most modern ( having most innovations ) out of three baltic languages - old prussian , latvian and lithuanian ( prussian being the most archaic , but a dead language ) . 
  ----------------------  it 's because latvians assimilated others , unlike lithuanians who managed only to get assimilated : by the 16th century the selonians , semigallians , and curonians ( kurs ) , who lived in areas of latvia and lithuania , had completely lost their national identities and were assimilated by the latvians and the lithuanians . 
  they left no written records . 
  nor did the yotvingians ( or suduvians ) , who lived in southwest lithuania and farther to the south ( in the territory of the present-day poland ) . 
  they became extinct around the 16th -- 17th century , being assimilated by the lithuanians in the north and the slavs in the south . 
  we would need a name for a new state . 
  litlatvia , latlivia , aistia , baltia , baltic republic ? 
  if latvian language is vanilla ice cream then why your stress is always on the first syllable in latvian ? 
  you did n't preserve this chaotic proto-indo-european feature . 
  [ where 's your free stress ? 
  ] ( http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/89/334x141x15389-004-185b5109.jpg.pagespeed.ic.xwikgwhj_l.webp )  lithuanian has a flexible stress , `` that can occur on any syllable of the word . 
  some nouns and adjectives have fixed stress , that is , an accent remains on the same stem syllable in all the inflections . 
  other nouns and adjectives have mobile stress where the accent moves from place to place , particularly between stem and ending . 
  in each declension of the noun or adjective , there are four accent classes , one fixed and three mobile , all with different patterns of movement . '', 
  [ lithuanian nominal stems are divided into four accentual classes ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/164b7c9d4eff51939aea23b75a134d1a.png ) . 
  checkmate , you 're strawberry ice cream . 
  implying latvian is not a dialect wink wink,
