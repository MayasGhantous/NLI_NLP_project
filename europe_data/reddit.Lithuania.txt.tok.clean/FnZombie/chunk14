   you sound more like a troll . 
  `` put them in camps '' ... unfortunately , you 're probably not a troll , you 're just a dumbfuck . 
  refugee camps already exist in europe and turkey . 
  we 're talking about benefit seekers in this thread . 
  i 'm just making an economically viable suggestion how to discourage that kind of people . 
  care to give any viable suggestions or you 'll just insult everyone who does n't agree with `` mirror mirror on the wall , who 's the kindest and non-nazi of them all '' policy that works so well at the moment ? 
  you must be a troll, 
  me and you are forced to earn our living too by our governments, 
   i do n't know how you think that officials will be able to ` check databases ' of people war-torn countries i 'm not suggesting keeping actual refugees in camps, 
  it does n't mater what they say , officials could check database by cooperating with presumed state of origin . 
  actual refugee can apply for asylum . 
  this would scare some of the benefit shoppers . 
  it 's not forced labour , unless you count wage labour as forced labour ? 
  you work , you earn money , you spend money . 
  it 's not a prison , they could go back home once they remember where they come from if they 're not actual refugees . 
  put them in camps , they can stay there and work for food and housing until they remember their names and nationalities . 
  damn , fam , you 're hanging out with the wrong crowd . 
  because poland 's democracy is threatened by the new government 's actions . 
  the government 's media reforms give the treasury minister the power to appoint and fire the heads of public television and radio , as well as civil service directors . 
  they will no longer be hired through public contests organised by the national broadcasting council like it was previously . 
  all because pis believed that journalists are biased against them in their coverage . 
   lukashenko stated that `` this is a geopolitical project '' . 
  what does this mean ? 
  my guess is that belarus is cornered by another country to carry out this project just to fuck with lithuania once again . 
   what has changed in belarus ( if anything ) since ukraine changed course from russia towards eu ? 
  [ they 're slowly reversing self-rusification ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/28/-sp-russian-belarus-reclaims-language-belarusian )  do you envision same thing happening to belarus ? 
  nope , never . 
  unless russia gets eaten by the largest sinkhole or a civil war happens in russia . 
   and a more down to earth question , how is your everyday life afected by eu-russia sanctions and cooling of relations ? 
  i believe milk price dropped ? 
  that 's a good question for a non european subreddit like / r/askanamerican, 
   is turkey actively aggressive towards their neighbors ? 
  cause russia does constant fly-overs over lithuanian , estonian , swedish borders , and european countries kept selling them arms . 
   and you 're telling me eastern european countries , that are part of nato and therefore guarenteed by law that we would intervene in case of agression , want our troops to be deployed because they `` feel '' threatened ? 
  how would you intervene in case of aggression if all of your troops are deployed in your former colonies ? 
  it would be already too late . 
  that 's one of the many reasons ee relies on usa to be protected . 
  me too, 
  it 's really simple : 1 . 
  press `` alt + shift '' to change language input from english to lithuanian 2 . 
  now you type these letters '' \u0105\u010d\u0119\u0117\u012f\u0161\u0173\u016b\u017e '' instead of numbers 3 . 
  press `` alt + shift '' to go back to english . 
  now you can write numbers and symbols like '' @ # $ & '' again . 
   get the whole sense that the country is somewhat stuck in that time 1990 that 's true for the country side  i would like to see a more brighter side of the country you 'd need to check pictures of major cities , not peripheries then ;-), 
  [ we alternate between lithuanian specific leters and numbers/symbols ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gctzaxyqn05tov-au_n9ixtdafr40uvd-2zmiiva0fzas-jkuwio ), 
  were you expecting to see something in vilages/towns in the middle of nowhere ? 
  i only remember one instance when germany supported south stream . 
  after the project was canceled and it was merkel backing bulgaria to negotiate again with russia after russia announced plans with turkey . 
  germany 's stance seemed indifferent during the time . 
   you claim that ` only six countries were in favour of ss ' `` only '' ? 
  i meant six eu countries : austria , bulgaria , croatia , greece , hungary and slovenia + non eu countries : serbia and russia , which signed inter-governmental agreements , were in favor . 
  i 'd argue that common currency is convenient too, 
   source ? 
  source of what ? 
  that it was blocked by the eu ? 
  or that bulgaria halted the south stream project twice because of the eu and usa pressure ? 
  what does `` your countries ? '', 
  refer to ? 
  since you replied to a user with latvian flair , it probably refers to baltic countries ? 
  well lithuania was against it and pushed for `` eu 's third energy package '' . 
  and the south stream halt was called `` good showcase of european unity '' by our president . 
  both projects are frowned upon here . 
   when has eastern europe ever cooperated ? 
  always ? 
  ee does n't negotiate with terrorists though . 
   why did n't your countries oppose south stream then ( prior to it being abandoned ) ? 
  it was opposed and was blocked by the eu . 
  6 countries were in favor of it . 
   deeply concerned, 
  as i understand it 's more about : * `` we want to be equal '' ( everyone is poor except the ruling class ) * `` we want to be respected in our jobs '' ( you get a ribbon or a cheap metallic pendant ) * `` we want order '' ( you get beat up by the milicia/police and you ca n't complain to anyone about it ; you get tortured or `` removed '' by the kgb , nobody asks any questions regarding it ; for saying certain things you lose your job , you get kicked out from you school/university . 
  your family is deported ) * `` we want someone to lead us '' ( you get a ruthless dictator ) * `` we want free shit !, 
  like free housing '' ( someone gets killed or deported and you get their home ) * `` we want to be feared and respected ! '', 
  ( your economical and social situation does n't change because of that . 
  everyone despises and ridicules you instead ) these people think socialist utopia is free , you just need to change the system and suddenly there 's money for free cars , free houses/flats , free healthcare . 
  most of them are just simpletons feeling nostalgia for those times and uniformed youth . 
  or just people with slave mentality . 
  more than half of russians do n't understand what they want . 
  apparently we had a couple of those back in the good old days . 
  but not in the modern sense . 
  * lithuanian civil war ( 1249 -- 1253 ) , between mindaugas and vykintas with tautvilas * lithuanian civil war ( 1263 -- 1264 ) , after assassination of mindaugas * lithuanian civil war ( 1381 -- 1384 ) between jogaila and his uncle k\u0119stutis with son vytautas * lithuanian civil war ( 1389 -- 1392 ) between jogaila and his cousin vytautas * lithuanian civil war ( 1431 -- 1435 ) between \u0160vitrigaila and sigismund k\u0119stutaitis * civil war in lithuania ( 1700 ) between several powerful magnate families https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_civil_war, 
  to whom ? 
  latvian council/soviet ? 
   btw : `` is it contagious ? '', 
  ... seriously ? 
  they 're afraid they 'll become gay turtles too, 
  a tradition ? 
  it 's extremely new . 
  the notorious hacker known as 4chan ? 
  eu is the agressor right ? 
  poor russia being bulied again . 
  evil eu wants to conquer them ? 
  exactly , a referendum about joining both eu and nato would be welcomed, 
  where , you europhobe ? 
  we could have been a kingdom too if somebody had n't stolen the crown, 
   m\u0101ras zeme your neighbor would think it means `` plague land '' . 
  `` maras '' - `` plague '' in lithuanian . 
   so many people just think of belarus as of white russia rather than ruthenia of rus ' . 
  and it oppresses real identity of the nation it does n't help when majority of them speak russian natively, 
  extremely triggered, 
  do n't feed the troll,
