  azov battalion is know as far right unit , so none of this is suprising . 
  the slavic svastika in the background is also known as slavic sun wheel . 
  you know slavic ancestors used to be huge nazis back in 4000 bc . 
   fourthly , they have to build a wall . 
  and we 'll make you pay for it . 
  make lithuania great again !, 
  we already call you \u010cekija, 
  but there 's no profit in that . 
  and look russia is good again , look how long it has n't invaded another country since ukraine .

  original poster did n't even call commonwealth `` democratic '' , he called it `` quasi democratic '' . 
  a system where king was elected by szlachta ( 15 % of commonwealth 's population ) was more `` democratic '' than a system where kings were `` elected by god '' . 
  all the szlachta were equal in rights and privileges , seimas could veto king 's laws , taxation , foreign affairs , declaration of war and they could disobey any of king 's decrees they deemed illegal . 
  exceptionally progressive for it 's time . 
  kievan rus rightful finnish clay !, 
  oh boy , you made someone 's tea boil, 
  do n't tell russians that, 
   athens was anything but democratic . 
  a system where only a select few lucky to be born into the right families can vote is not a democracy in the modern sense . 
   not our responsibility . 
  it 's not but you do it to stay relevant big player in the world  we give our food protection away food laws regarding what chemicals get into it are much stricter here than in your country , therefore food products here are much more expensive . 
   it over here and have to pay for college , healthcare , and housing . 
  because majority of americans are afraid of `` communism '' aka universal health care , free education and free housing , which are publicly funded through taxation . 
   sanders and trump both agree we 're getting taken . 
  sanders should force all us companies to repatriate all overseas funds and return manufacturing back to the states . 
  sounds like a populist , neither of those things will happen . 
  especially when it 's cheaper to manufacture something in china than back home , unless americans wants to pay more for products . 
  ----- overall it seems that you would like to have more taxes and spend more money on food and products . 
  lose global superpower status an be dictated by china or india or brazil or russia . 
  when you kill your whole military industry because of non-interventionism policy , you think that money that is used for military expenses will exist to fund universal health care , free education and free housing ? 
  it wo n't . 
  and all of religious radicals will just leave usa alone ? 
  i 'd predict that terrorist attacks would be more frequent after that . 
   the us should drop out of nato and pull all of its troops out of europe all together . 
  it 's costing us so much and it 's none of our business being over there . 
  if you pull all of your troops from everywhere you 'll lose your influence in the world and someone will replace that power vacuum , like china for example . 
  you want to live in a china dominated world ? 
   we are n't the world police yes you are, 
  i 'll ask you two questions : do you know where bandera was before and during volhynia-galicia massacres ? 
  and how he possible could have given/sent those orders for massacres ? 
  lithuania votes no belarus ca n't vote poland votes 50/50 , since poland hates everyone ukraine votes yes first commonwealth was n't equal , neither the second would be . 
  and no commonwealth 2.0 would n't be a bigger player than russia with poor economy , small military and war in the east . 
  for now he 'll be a celebrity . 
  he 'll be invited to various talk shows , dance shows , events , interviews and etc. 
  since he speaks the language people will look more positively at him . 
  we got an unicorn here . 
  `` i heard germany has a lot of money , but i want to be in lithuania . 
  i speak the language '' more of him speaking lithuanian https://youtu.be/vs2-p76sl9e and https://youtu.be/f65tdouz6b0, 
  not always that led to the best outcome . 
  slavery is extremely beneficial for example . 
  so is land grabs/expansions , but that always led to wars . 
  even starting wars in other countries is sometimes beneficial . 
  survival of the fittest right ? 
  quoted from http://www.lb.lt/direct_investment_in_q1_2015_1 so the first 2015 quarter there 's also this ( 2012-2013 period ) : https://www.lb.lt/stat_pub/statbrowser.aspx?group=8006&amp;lang=en,

   main sponsor , poland could you explain ? 
  til that my country lithuania is an economic powerhouse [ gdp ( ppp ) per capita 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union ),

   why this association is good for the netherlands if every government started to think like that , we might see a dismantlement of eu . 
  i believe his grandparents wore stars with hammer and scythe on them . 
  i might be confusing users though . 
  happens with these hardcore pro-kremlin types . 
  news like these do not surprise me at all . 
  back a couple of years ago russian lawmakers discussed [ banning emo music and culture ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/22/russian.emo ) . 
  the fact that it was up for vote shows what backward people are in power . 
  well their media conditioned them to believe that nato is here to destroy russia . 
  it 's understandable . 
  close to decent . 
  at least pronunciation is surprisingly good .

  `` gervaldas '' means `` good ruler/leader '' combination of `` geras '' and `` valdovas '' .

  there 's other facebook clones such as studivz , xiaonei , desimartini , studentsn and other . 
  are you a question bot ? 
  no , but vk is . 
  it 's facebook for cis region, 
  one.lt is too good ... why people have to be such hipsters and use facebook knockoffs , when there 's already semi-useless facebook . 
  in suicide notes, 
  this is yet another warmongering russophobic ploy by cia to make our leader look bad, 
  absolutely , for my premium facebook gold account, 
  it was a democratic referendum with armed self-defense units without any foreign involvement . 
  although it was illegal , europe has always been russian . 
  do n't you watch government funded news ? 
  ahh vkontakt ... poor man 's facebook, 
  mods there do n't get paid for having a laugh with the enemy . 
  what no native americans in poland ? 
  `` easter '' is called `` velykos '' , `` pasninkas '' means `` fasting '' in lithuanian . 
   by a male relative do n't give that railway any ideas, 
  before grand duchy of lithuania ( lithuania proper + former principalities of kievan rus ) , there was duchy of lithuania , ethnic lithuanian state .
