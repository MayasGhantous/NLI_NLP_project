  how can belarus call itself `` litva '' when there 's been `` litva '' already ? 
  bashar al-assad has n't applied for refugee status yet, 
  hiding it so other muslim would n't plainly throw it in the trash bin ? 
   the palestinian flag does n't seem to suffer the same fate , notice it 's still leaning on her left arm . 
  we do n't see what happens with palestinian flag after she hids israel flag under the georgian flag and walks away  plus i mean seriously , trashing/hiding flags of nations who are expressin sympathy at a memorial ? 
  how fucked up is that we do n't know what the woman was thinking when she did this . 
  arab antisemitism is fucked up , i almost thought she would pick up and throw away the israel flag , but she hid it instead , my guess is other muslims would have thrashed it . 
  what do you mean ? 
  she takes the flags of palestine and israel , i guess she thought that those two flags could provoke anger at a time of mourning ? 
  i mean she does n't remove israel flag , just hides it from plain sight . 
  looks like we got similar laws with slovakia, 
  a huge drawback of opening borders with economically better off countries . 
  an unbelievable short-sightedness of our politicians and lack of political will or means to fix that . 
   the gap between east and west have n't really changed during the soviets . 
  the gap gets a lot bigger for commie states, 
   eastern europe which specific countries ? 
  or are we talking about the homogenous federation of eastern europe ? 
   all you have to do is read a little about the reception of some of the people who actually made it out of the nazi concentration camps and tried to go back home and you 'll understand . 
  i would love to read about that, 
  pork and beans, 
  hey , at least the color arrangement is different . 
  looking at you [ myanmar ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/flag_of_myanmar.svg/1800px-flag_of_myanmar.svg.png ) . 
  i suppose you 'd put your flag in the worst list too ? 
  worst : any white/blue/red tricolor/two-color variation except czech , uk , england and greek flags since those are original . 
  albanian for puting black color on red . 
  best : nordic cross flags , sami people flag , switzerland 's flag , spanish flag , fyrom flag . 
  so ano all anno ? 
  we got `` ane ? '', 
  bitchy sarcastic short version of `` ar ne ? '', 
  - `` right ? '' / `` yeah ? '' / `` correct ? '', 
  `` tai ne ... '' is our `` duh , of course ... '' , `` na , ne '' is our `` well , no '', 
  and `` ei ! '', 
  means `` hey ! '', 
  in lithuanian, 
  `` vibrator '' is `` vibratorius '' , but `` d\u017eoistikas '' ( joystick ) is `` linksmakotis '' !, 
   would the countryside be nice ? 
  if you enjoy flat land , grass and same looking forests yes . 
   would the countryside be safe ? 
  yes . 
  but do n't ride your bike at night near any roads , people love speeding here when the popo is n't watching, 
  it fits with rt 's narrative of `` lol lol baltics are the new nazi reich lol '', 
  it 's healthier to drink bleach than read delfi comment section, 
  canada is not in europe, 
  it might be something related to leaching benefits from working people and running drug and begging cartels around the continent . 
  but never mind , i 'll go to my corner and check my privileges . 
   because you 're east from us and were in the soviet union ? 
  we 're on top of you , our eastern border matches your eastern border , east of you is belarus and ukraine . 
  and what does `` east '' mean ? 
  you 're eastern european like everyone else . 
   and it sure does n't seem you 're any richer when looking at your cities . 
  it 's a small percentage , no worry , pan polski . 
  where does the polish impression that lithuania is somehow super poor come from ? 
  i 've seen it all over the internet . 
  / r/russia is an echo chamber with mods on a power trip . 
  at least , here mods ban you for hate speech and not for certain views or criticism . 
  ( like i was banned by their subreddit 's own beria for criticizing soviet union and complaining about shitty nationalistic meme on the front page when i suggested mods should prohibit low effort content ) . 
  i came there to learn more about russia and maybe understand the lunacy , but sadly , i learned that russian mentality is closer to chinese than european , so i guess that the saying `` russia can not be understood with the mind alone '' is true . 
  i 'm saying that someone spends too much time on / r/russia, 
  / r/russia is leaking again, 
   k\u0101rlis ser\u017eants , a high-ranking member of the latvian parliament or saeima and part of the ruling coalition would have been awkward he chose to be ser\u017eantas instead, 
  and yet it does n't have any anti-gay laws similar to russia 's . 
  while lithuania is moving slowly like a turtle to improve lgbt rights , at least it 's not moving backwards . 
   then you also have a law against propaganda . 
  against soviet and nazi symbols , denial of war crimes and nazi/soviet crimes , denial of holocaust , hate speach and propagation of war ? 
   you have the minimum of discrimination laws that eu requires what would be considered maximum ? 
  which human rights does lithuania violate ? 
   i would send them to you there 's no rush on the internet . 
  so we have eu laws , but they 're similar to russian laws ? 
  i do n't get your point . 
  so to summarize , you wrote that comment not knowing what you 're talking about ? 
  just ireland going for the cultural victory . 
  '' ` it 's wonderful that vilnius joins so many cities around the world today to celebrate with us ' , david noonan said . 
  the ambassador also recalled the many lithuanians that now make their home in ireland , saying ` as long as they 're in ireland we 'd like you to know that we want them to feel the traditional irish welcome . '', 
  why catholics celebrate a day of a catholic saint ? 
  same reason other saints are celebrated . 
  happy st. patrick 's day !, 
  on this day [ vilnius city 's main river vilnia/vilnel \u0117 gets colored in green ] ( https://youtu.be/tj-q3lm9tki ) . 
  which one 's exactly ? 
  we do n't have anti-gay propaganda laws , baltic pride is an annual lgbt pride parade , lgbt is protected by anti-discrimination laws . 
  obviously without glorious soviet union there would be no progress made and you 'd be a illiterate farmer today . 
  the dispute is completely unknown here , so people just call it `` makedonija '' . 
  `` buvusi jugoslavijos respublika makedonija '' would be ridiculous for a normal conversation . 
  i fully understand and support greeks protecting their heritage though . 
  macedonia should keep the name , but not pretend to be something it is n't . 
  i do n't think `` fuck shit up '' is a better policy than `` nation-building '', 
  strangely enough in lithuania we were thought that we 're baltic and that some french folks measured europe and found that the geographical center is in lithuania ( also it was implied that we have to look up to scandinavians since we 're `` trying '' follow their model ) and that 's pretty much it regarding geographical location of lithuania . 
  no `` we 're central/northern/eastern europe '' . 
  i only started to care about it because of reddit . 
   who are they ? 
  i was referring to people in countries who were once behind the iron curtain , who dislike being referred to as `` eastern europeans ''  nope , i 'm as lithuanian as it gets neither majority of my friends are russian ( i do have a few though , but besides the accent they are just as lithuanian ) , no idea how that 'd be relevant though . 
  sometimes people have an experience bias when they 're in certain surroundings/environments . 
  it would n't be out of ordinary to speculate that one would feel culturally closer to x culture when his surrounded by x people . 
   once you meet one in actually different culture ( say italy or w/e ) you certainly begin to notice and appreciate the similarities . 
  i 've met some erasmus students in czech republic while visiting one of my friend for a week . 
  none of the erasmus students seemed different , everyone was just `` european '' with their own personalities , not defined by their country of origin stereotypes , basically their nationalities did n't mater . 
  i 've even have two slovenian friends with whom i keep in contact on regular basis . 
  they do since it puts them with russia in one group . 
  also it 's mostly pc term used more to refer to ex-communist states rather than a geographical term . 
  do you have russian/belorussian/ukrainian relatives or do your parents speak russian at home or majority of your friends are russian-lithuanians ? 
  me personally , i was born in post-soviet lithuania , so i do n't feel any connection with russia , orthodox religion/culture and communism .
