  part of me is indeferent , the other part is exited to see what would happen if uk left . 
  would it hurt uk economically ? 
  would decisions in the eu be implemented faster ? 
  would other countries follow ? 
  one thing is certain . 
  we would n't see `` uk is leaving , this time for sure !, 
  47476337 '' thread on the front page of / r/europe anymore . 
  however , `` ukraine did something stupid '' , `` nazi poland is nazi again says left media '' , `` poles are offended by x '' , `` estonia did something '' , `` look at this graph that shows western europe is still better than eastern europe '' , `` russia entered x countries space nr . 
  6655667 '' , `` erdogan said something stupid again nr . 
  infinity '' , `` greece is fucked , you wo n't believe these top 10 reasons why '' , `` russia is on the brink of collapse nr . 
  6788484 '' , `` look at this beautiful picture modified with photoshop '' , `` look at this photo from lithuania , it 's from vilnius , again !, 
  surprise !, 
  '' , `` syria is fucked , europe is fucked . 
  refugees are fucked . 
  european women are fucked , literally '' . 
  greco-roman heritage and influence, 
   and , yes , the lithuanians have a thing for being somehow the purest of all aryans . 
  i do n't know what nonsense you 're talking about . 
   and the latvians had even distributed mittens with swastikas to their nato partners to prove themselves somehow especially white . 
  symbol that has been used by indo-europeans ? 
  how does that prove that someone is white anyway ? 
  hindu 's are obviously nazis in disguise . 
  / s guess what , swastika symbol was used by slavs too . 
   but according to the linguists even the languages are actually the closest buds with slavs and not with the ancient grecians . 
  neither this graph claims that baltic and ancient greek languages belong to one group . 
   post-soviet eastern europeans with all the same words as elsewhere in the region but somehow related more to the ancient greeks . 
  you sound like you 're extremely frustrated and maybe jealous or something . 
  how about leaving linguistic studies to linguistic experts and vent your frustration somewhere else ? 
  prisoners of a katorga would have prefered working in a prison on mediterranean coast rather than in siberia . 
  probably he was very impressed by it, 
  please do n't make `` joseph stalin '' a meme, 
  these death camps existed in russian empire - [ katorga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katorga ) . 
  [ gulag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulag ) system was just the continuation of the tradition . 
  russian death camps ... or was it empire death camps ? 
  these languages are not mutually intelligible . 
  fixed it, 
  lithuanian language is very conservative/archaic , retaining many features of proto-indo-european language found only in ancient languages such as sanskrit or ancient greek . 
  some words have not changed their forms for the last five thousand years . 
  i think these protesters are mixing up their country . 
  putin 's flag , russian empire flag , potato beetle flag , donetsk 's and luhansk 's `` rebel '' flags lol . 
  because i have a few slovenian friends . 
   in sweden , a teen was stabbed and killed by his fellow classmate for trying to protect his female classmate from sexual assault and possibly rape . 
  off topic a bit : i do n't know if it 's a cruel fate 's joke or what , but victims name was `` arminas '' which in lithuanian means `` also mentioned '' ( old lithuanian/baltic `` ar '' ( and ) + min - ( min\u0117ti ( mention ) ) , basically the meaning is `` someone who is mentioned '' . 
  his murder had a lot of media coverage around europe . 
  tell us where you found the money pipe going from finland to estonia and nobody gets hurt, 
  one lane for you , one for eastern europe . 
  where do western european trucks go ? 
  why would i ? 
  i do n't know them personally and they 're seeking fortune elsewhere , making a different country their home . 
  best of luck to them . 
  i could n't care less about immigrants abroad, 
   caralho obviously the king has to be the biggest dick in town, 
   lithuania historically has no claim to latvia really [ sure  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_livonia )  it was german , swedish and russian far longer which is irrelevant , but we 're joking here anyway ;-), 
  i see there 's a lot of confusion here . 
  i misinterpreted the guy 's comment ( the one i replied too ) and user `` thatfatpolishdude '' could have worded his comment better , i believe he meant that there were `` couple of jewish soviet-sympathizers and officials '' which were known to the public ( instead of general `` jewish '' population ) . 
  i guess it 's one of the cases here of cultural difference in communication . 
  off the top of my head https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yitzhak_arad https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salomon_morel i guess being a jew makes you untouchable and every crime is justified , thinking otherwise is antisemitic . 
  out-suomi the suomi, 
  we 'd be fucked without nato . 
  neutrality got us occupied last time . 
  wtf latvia , you scary . 
  what are you gon na do with all those guns ? 
  [ so finland ? 
  ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrnotmxuy64vhmkhgjtg5e6oegcz69llspbtzneaqxp3e7ypbu3 ), 
  our `` pirtis '' ( finnish : sauna ) are n't as dry as finnish sauna ( lithuanian : suomi\u0161ka pirtis ) . 
  btw finnish word `` pirtti '' is a baltic loan word which used to mean what `` sauna '' means now , now it has a different meaning . 
  would love it if someone from finland could elaborate how and why this change happened ? 
  finland is n't safe for women , children and rocket scientists, 
  vladivostok should n't have dressed that way if it did n't want to be part of russia, 
  what does that mean eastern europe is ? 
  [ ever heard about eastern orthodoxy ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/3/36/20090611185239!reviewed_version_of_eastern_orthodoxy_in_europe.png )  like a bit of russia ? 
  [ enough eastern europe ?

  not viewing the link is very reddit of you, 
  what did agnia grigas smoke ...  in addition to the region 's problematic geography and militarized environment due to neighbouring kaliningrad and ** belarus ** , the suwalki gap is different and potentially an even more vulnerable target because the kremlin could exploit the ** region 's historic ethnic tensions ** . 
  belarus would never ever let russia use it 's territory to invade lithuania or poland as long as lukashenko is the president . 
  that would be bad for belorussian business and batka has sentimental feelings for `` historical friends '' . 
  there are no modern ethnic tensions . 
   meanwhile , neighbouring belarus , which remains among russia 's closest and most loyal political and military allies , has been in discussions to house a large russian air base . 
  which was rejected by lukashenko the moment he found out about it . 
  situation in ukraine was a wake up call for him . 
   it is also a worrying sign that lithuanian radicals , with seeming affinity for russia , from time to time put claims in social media arguing for lithuania to regain the suwalki triangle from poland . 
  somebody takes delfi 's comment section too seriously . 
  i hope that agnia does n't read youtube comments as well . 
   it is not out of the realm of possibility that ethnic tensions in suwalki could be used to stir up local separatism , that radical calls could be made for the region 's incorporation into kaliningrad why would poles and lithuanians want to join russia ? 
  that 's the big question . 
  someone who 's not familiar with these two countries could read this article and get an impression that these two countries have knives at each other 's throats or something . 
  my life is a lie . 
  i thought hesburger was german and rimi was lithuanian . 
  dnb ? 
  or rock 'n' roll ? 
  completely forgot about danske bank, 
  sweden - skandinaviska enskilda banken , swedbank , nordea , rimi , ikea and electricity now norwegian gas + dnb bank , statoil , narvesen kiosks danish - danske bank finnish - hesburger , neste oil , prisma and stockmann . 
  edit : added everything mentioned below, 
   real powerful dictatorial state, 
  that 's a weird mentality : `` i can criticize and poke fun at anyone i want !, 
  but how dare they criticize my government ?! '', 
  making fun of country 's leaders/political system = making fun of the people ? 
  by default you 're eastern european because of the union with east germany,
