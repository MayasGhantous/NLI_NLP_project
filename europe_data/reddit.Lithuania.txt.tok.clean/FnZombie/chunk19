  nope, 
  shhh , let them feel special, 
  what a speciesistic statement !, 
  let 's just say that for war criminals and some foreign organisations half-thruth propaganda like this is very beneficial and convenient . 
  it 's just a place where everyone from around the country comes to live and work , and nobody gets murdered for being from a different city , town , village . 
  pure national unity ;d, 
  i feel like there 's a shit-storm a brewing ... 
  \u0160iur , naubodi laiks to \u010deind\u017e , but giv it a fiu dekeids end evribodi vyl fink it vaz a g\u016bd aidea, 
  i do n't know how is that pronounced, 
  ~ 350,74 eur after taxes, 
  could write `` ch '' though, 
  a neighbour that is a direct threat to his country 's national security . 
   remain irrelevant oh , boy , the grand prize everyone seeks to achieve - `` being relevant in a global scale '' . 
  what an imperialistic goal . 
  so 20th century though . 
  does it matter if the world is talking about you if you live in deep manure ? 
  could you expand on that ? 
   martians they took crimea, 
  western latvia is not latvia ? 
  crimea justified ? 
  that 's only partially true for poland because western ukraine is perfectly stable . 
  ukraine already has the support of lithuania and poland . 
  litpolukrbrig troops will be stationed in their respective countries and actually gathering together only for exercises and foreign peacekeeping operations given to it by nato , eu and un . 
  it wo n't see any fighting in ukraine . 
  why some brigade needs the support of general polish population ? 
  and , by the way , it 's not only polish-ukrainian brigade . 
  also this brigade will not see any actual fighting . 
  we will need to set up camps to keep refugees from escaping to sweden and germany . 
  we 're such humanitarians . 
  there 's nothing to gain for poland and lithuania from this, 
   polish soldiers getting killed would be a major problem for russia . 
  how so ? 
  russian officials have n't returned the wreckage of a polish government airliner after it crashed ( killing poland 's president , president 's wife and some of the country 's political , military elite ) for six years ( ? ), 
  now . 
  also , downing of the mh17 malaysia plane by russian supported `` rebels '' had no consequences for russia too . 
  imo it would take a us soldier dying for something to happen to `` green men from mars '' or `` rebels '' . 
  and even then nato would n't risk a war with russia . 
  one redditor wrote the same comment . 
  i 've replied to him . 
  states collapse because of ethnic/national division , self-determination . 
  although russia is a multi-national state with more than hundred ethnic groups , 80 % of the country 's population identify as russians . 
  why would one ethnic group want to live in separate states ? 
  that 's completely not russian national character . 
  ukraine and moldova are way in a worse situation and those countries did n't collapse . 
  sanctions wo n't make russia collapse , they 're a must to contain current russia until kremlin changes it 's foreign policies . 
  i 've heard these stories about `` russia collapsing any day now '' for years . 
  just like iran collapsed right ? 
  commonwealth is already complete . 
   a joint brigade of 4,000 troops that 's adorable . 
   the multinational brigade is a sign , symbol and very clear signal to anyone who would want to undermine peace in europe you better be peacefull or 4000 troops will visit you one day  `` we see this brigade as a driving force that will improve our army , '' poltorak said what can you learn from a minuture brigade that you could n't learn from nato instructors teaching your national army ? 
  the importance of friendship between foreign nations ? 
  how to party really hard ? 
  approximately : never . 
  too busy enjoying our 25 + years of sovereignty at the moment . 
  commonwealth too stronk, 
  with the exception of romuva religion , we also have a celebration every year called [ u\u017egavin\u0117s ] ( http://gbtimes.com/travel/uzgavenes-lithuanias-mardi-gras ) when people dress up in costumes and [ burn mor\u0117 ] ( https://youtu.be/yy7ehfbyeq0 ) to scare away winter . 
  for example : https://youtu.be/hcmxokcubmm, 
  seriously ? 
  no lithuania when it 's something related to paganism ? 
  those are probably mines, 
  i 'm not sure what you 're implying here ? 
   which simply was not the case - finland was way , way ahead as indicated by the image i posted . 
  it was ahead . 
  does that imply that we were doomed to never catch up with finland ? 
   now you 're talking about steadily catching up - entirely different matter . 
  talking about current time, 
  become a fully democratic country and have an economy of a western country similar to finland ( not exactly the same ) ? 
  we 're steadily catching up http://www.truelithuania.com/nuotraukos/lithuaniafinlandeconomypopulationcomparison.png, 
  finland was mining iron , nickel , zinc , chromium , cobalt , copper and by-products such as gold , silver , cadmium and titanium . 
  while lithuania extracts only peat and some industrial minerals such as cement , clay , dolomite , limestone , nitrogen , glass sand and gravel . 
  amount of resources that baltic states lack ? 
  does n't change the fact that we 'd have western standards of living anyway if not for the communist experiment, 
  baltic way , rose revolution , orange revolution, 
   that might 've been but they could 've also gone the way of portugal , greece or spain i 'm 90 % sure we 'd have done the same thing what finland ( ex-baltic state ) did . 
   for example , all three of the baltics had right-wing dictatorships ( still vastly better than soviet stooges mind you ) at the helm prior to being invaded . 
  what about germany , italy ... ? 
  also lithuania had a presidential-authoritarianism system with leader antanas smetona who hated racism , national socialism ( lithuania was the first country to trial nazis back in 1934 ) and communism . 
  now i want some led\u0173 ; /, 
  apparently conquering lands and expanding influence is n't considered as power while being a dwarf with mythical wealth ( medieval switzerland ? ), 
  and population so cramped up in it 's borders , that no other european state had at that time , is . 
   i guess that 's why kazakhstan , mongolia and democratic republic of congo are international powerhouses , while little and irrelevant likes of united kingdom , japan or germany have to sit quietly and wait for what big powers decide . 
  modern world = / = medieval one  yes , the european history was created by polish chauvinists european was not , your was . 
   the grounds never were equal , poland was way more developed , way stronger economically and way more influential than lithuania . 
  wow , so influential , much strong : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/lietuva_ir_lenkija.lithuania_and_poland_1387.png http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/genealogy/images/b/bb/polska_1386_-_1434.png/revision/latest?cb=20110512203746  ... as well as the european customs , culture , science , etc. 
  all of which happened to come to lithuania through poland . 
  biggest historical lie ever . 
  created by polish chauvinists in 20th century , repeated by modern neo-nazis . 
   likely as a reaction to what was happening in the republic of lithuania what an eternal martyr poland is , free of guilt and abused by everyone . 
  the dialect is called `` po prostu '' actually . 
  and it 's spoken by native belarusians ( tutejszy ) in vilnius . 
  does `` iranas '' count ? 
  `` green if name ends with '' - \u0438\u044f '' ( - iya ) '' , orange for everything else, 
  they already did, 
   kuningas ( king ) comes from proto germanic . 
  \\* kuningaz lithuanian word for `` priest '' is `` kunigas '' , while `` king ' in our language is `` karalius '' - a loan word from slavic neighbors ( belorussian '' \u043a\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c / karol '' , which origin is from the name `` karolus magnus '' ( charlemagne ) ( in lithuanian : `` karolis didysis '' ) . 
  funnily enough `` k\u016bningas '' means `` fat , massive , bulky male '' in lithuanian .
