  approximalely 1/4 of it, 
  there are neonazis everywhere ... 
  even if bandera never existed , there would still be ukrainian neonazis regardless . 
  all the countries have controversial national heroes . 
  your point ? 
  poland was n't a [ soviet state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post-soviet_states ) . 
  do you mean [ communist state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_state ) ? 
  sure , the more money you 'll spend on unnecessary things the better . 
   why would german court defend polish interest ? 
  what ? 
  courts should be fair and impartial . 
   of course . 
  because , you see , it 's your problem , not ours . 
  you think that the poles are to blame ? 
  okay , go blame them , it wo n't change the fact that you used to share a country , hence a responsibility for everything that said country did . 
  it was n't a democratic country with elected leaders by the population , it did n't start with a revolution either , it was a medieval state with kings - `` elected by god '' . 
  i guess polonized nobles are too blame . 
  lithuanians generally do n't view plc very favorably since our language and culture went almost extinct . 
   because you 've tried to conquer us , convert us , forcefully latinize us for five hundred years in a row . 
  our country had almost perished during one of those attempts . 
  i like how you people always omit that part . 
  what is this ` we ' , `` us '' , `` our country '' ? 
  modern day russians/russia or eastern slavs in general ? 
  back then people identified with their villages , towns , clans and dukes . 
  national identity as we understand it now did n't exist yet . 
  it 's strange to see someone identifying with ancestors of belarusians/ukrainians if you 're russian . 
  i understand that whole `` we were one people '' thing which was true , but come on , it is n't the case now , all three countries have their languages and identities . 
  lithuanians shared their country with rus ' people before union with poland , even using their language in chancellery , as understood today as `` official language ' . 
  how oppressive lithuanian were , not forcing their language , nor religion on a majority of slavic inhabitants in grand duchy of lithuania . 
  and they even had royal marriages !, 
  lithuanians could n't possibly latinize eastern slavs since lithuanians did n't have any writing system and borrowed old church slavonic for foreign affairs after acquiring former kievan rus ' principalities . 
  they even lost a lot of ethnic lithuanian land because of assimilation ( see western belarus ) . 
   i do n't see why we , as the russians , should be more sympathetic to you being subjugated by foreign elites during pol times , than you are towards us being subjugated during the soviet epoch . 
  you blame us , russians , for everything soviets did , so why on earth should ' t we ? 
  i really just wanted to correct your statement that ` lithuanians oppressed rus ' people '' and show how false that is . 
  i do n't feel like opening a can of worms and potentially start a flame war regarding `` soviet union '' . 
  it 's either one way mutual-jerk off or cutting throats . 
   as for your attempt to blame poles for everything , first of all , kudos for that mature attempt to push away a responsibility , second of all , i 'm not really interested in a blame game . 
  it 's not pushing away responsibility , it is a fact . 
  polish nobility had more power and influence than anyone else in the commonwealth , that 's why lithuanian and russian nobilities willingly self polonized to gain higher prestige or social status . 
  lithuanians could n't have forced catholicism on former kievan rus ' population when they themselves rejected it for so long . 
  lithuanians were the last pagan nation in europe fyi . 
   as you 've paid for everything you 've done . 
  muscovites were n't subjugated to polish-lithuanian commonwealth 's oppression like the ancestors of modern belarus and ukraine were . 
  polish-muscovite war lasted 13 years and ended with minimal territorial gains . 
  so for what lithuanians paid again ? 
  for our nobility 's self polonising ? 
  that 's why lithuanians had to experience even more brutal slavification - russification by russian empire ? 
  and occupation by soviet union ? 
  rainbow flags ? 
  how did n't they get murdered ? 
  like something innocent as [ t\u0119cza / rainbow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t\u0119cza_\\ ( warsaw \\ ) ) gets burned a lot . 
   and ( lithuanians ) were doing their best to convert russians both religiously ( via constant attempts to convert us into catholicism or a ` more catholicized ' version of orthodoxy ) and culturally . 
  your source denies that statement . 
  lithuanians and ruthenians lived in religious and cultural tolerance . 
  all the `` mean stuff '' started after union with poland , when `` polonisation '' began . 
  saying `` lithuanians tried to convert ruthenian religion and change their culture because of a one lithuanian man surrounded by majority of polish nobles , whose people were as much victim as ruthenians , would be false . 
  it 's like saying `` geogians '' oppresed russians because of something stalin did . 
   and were doing their best to convert russians both religiously ( via constant attempts to convert us into catholicism or a ` more catholicized ' version of orthodoxy ) and culturally . 
  lithuanians were pagans at the time . 
  we did n't force paganism on `` kievan rus ' '' lands . 
  linguistic , cultural , religious changes started after union with poland . 
  even from crimean to dutch, 
  i see you changed your flair, 
   prior to that lithuania has been part of russia for couple centuries that makes it right , right ? 
   and it 's not like lithuania has n't occupied russia on numerous occasions . 
  like once ? 
  do i have to remind you how much support france got from around europe after the paris attack ? 
  `` serbia-russia '' is smoke and mirrors like `` ukraine-russia '' was . 
  that 'd be slightly to the right . 
  this is the poop of europe ? 
  needs more '' ... but amerika ... '', 
  that 's what we used to call belarus - `` gudija '' for the most part of our history until soviets times . 
  not `` baltarusija '' ( white russia ) , like we do now . 
  we need more land, 
  have you just crawled from under a rock or something ? 
   although i never see any on the other subs might be because we tend to speak with each other in english , rather lithuanian . 
  literally one time, 
   do the poles like hate lithuanians or something ? 
  for pretty much any excuse they can find . 
   here in latvia we think you guys are as thick as thieves and love each other . 
  that 's strange . 
  what changed ? 
  ca n't wait for more russia 's aggression ? 
  or are you waiting for the increase of financial support to eurosceptic parties ? 
  how does estonia benefit from hurting itself the most with sanctions against their biggest trade partner ? 
  it 's not our fault border states are seemingly incapable of stopping refugee influx ? 
  why then give a potential future candidate false hope of becoming a member of our `` emotions before reason union '' and then abandon them ? 
  that makes two of us , pal . 
  i trust in border guards competence in this matter rather than random redditor 's or my own . 
  unfortunately trying to do anything to restrict movement of refuges is haram . 
  first step would be not to demonize countries that try to secure their borders and then do the same afterwards like hypocrites . 
   if the solution was `` reject all of them '' it does n't seem to me that your country wanted to participate in the funds for the execution of this `` solution '' . 
  let 's welcome everyone, 
   then being shocked and outraged when those countries do n't want to do what eastern europe wants . 
  stop refugee influx by securing eu borders ? 
  [ was is it this ? 
  / r/europe, 
  because ukraine was so rich before that , because poverty and corruption was n't the main reason maidan started and had popular support ...
