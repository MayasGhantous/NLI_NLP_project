  so putin 's sponsored party is even better for europe ? 
  yep , down-votes prove it, 
  happy birthday , suomija !, 
   actually this laws are same in the rest of eu . 
  nobody except lithuania is butchering names and changing spelling . 
  actually that 's not true . 
  for example , latvians have even more rigid rules . 
  for the matter of fact , all the languages butcher our names , except probably latvian language ( except they do n't have the letter '' \u0116 \u0117 '' ) . 
   you can have polish name in spain , germany or in uk normally in id . 
  maybe without special polish letters but still . 
  poles have the same in lithuania . 
  do you think we `` butcher '' names for shit and giggles ? 
  we could have so many hilarious situations and misunderstandings . 
  actually ... 
  i support changing rules of foreign name writing , it could be hilarious . 
  yes . 
  not yet . 
  have you forgotten how poles recently pushed us to implement similar laws they have in poland and the polish alphabet letters ? 
  i would n't expect them not meddling in our internal politics in the future once they have more leverage . 
  edit : down-votes ? 
  implying it 's not true what i wrote . 
  should have added / :d or / :| ? 
  i was calm, 
  would it make your rubbish joke any less funny ? 
  lithuanian armed forces have 15 000 active personnel . 
  you dun goofed, 
  somebody posted that picture on wiki, 
  funny how palestinians are the ones who shoot rockets at civilians and stab people with knives in the streets for being jewish . 
  thanks , fixed .

  but moving that direction with erdogan . 
  based on islam , not christianity . 
  so your presumption is based on skin color rather than culture ? 
  and what did you see in those videos and pictures ? 
  have you ever been to georgia ? 
  `` shit ghost '' could imply that it is a bad ghost-person . 
  it would be ignorant of us to asume that all ghosts are bad . 
  with so much salt , their salt industry must be booming . 
  i wonder if it 's technically possible for russia to respect country 's borders after months and months of warning . 
  ca n't use donestk , luhansk rebel tactics ? 
  they always scream that when someone dies . 
  do n't know why . 
  [ direct link to liveleak so you would n't have to go to rt.com ( nsfw ) ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=425_1448360570 ), 
  damn , those were the cheapest, 
  do you support europe 's and usa 's involvement in syria which led to the creation of isis ? 
  do you believe that the `` paris attack '' would have happened anyway had france not involved itself in syria ? 
   the majority of refugees are fleeing from assad , not isis and if assad was still in power , we would n't have influx of people coming into europe . 
   also your claims that the middle east would not experience war without ` meddling ' is based on what ? 
  i did n't claim that . 
  who is this `` you '' ? 
  let 's meddle with more middle eastern countries with our borders wide open . 
  surely the number of islamic extremists wo n't grow !, 
  it 's better to have failed states in the region rather than stable dictatorships who suppresses extremists !, 
   spreading more misinformation there are no russian troops in south ossetia ? 
  there was no war with georgia ? 
  who 's spreading the misinformation here ? 
  if nobody had meddled in the middle east we would n't need planes , tanks and fighters there in the first place . 
  no paris attacks , no islamic crusades against heretics , no bombs , no flood of refugees into europe ... 
  but the west needed to get rid of a brutal dictator `` for the sake of human rights , democracy and humanity '' . 
  why not invite north korea into this shit-fest too ? 
  i 've heard they have lot 's of soldiers and outdated tanks , planes . 
  an btw , by allying itself with russia , france will help to protect the same bloody tyrant it sought to get rid of in the first place . 
  germany : deutschland 83 uk : doctor who, 
   also , gas still flows from russia to ukraine even though they are at war . 
  they are not officially at war . 
  at least the russian side pretends that it 's not meddling in ukraine . 
  how about posting a real news source ? 
   `` the pursuit of the regime of ( prime minister of montenegro ) milo djukanovic , who has led the country for 15 years , to join nato , contradicts the will of the majority of people of this country '' rosija always knows best what foreign nations really want, 
  why is this important ? 
   is there a consensus among lithuanians as to where the country culturally is ? 
  not really discussed topic here . 
  lithuania has an observer status in the nordic council , it is part of nordea financial services group , nordic investment bank , nordic-baltic eight and nordic battlegroup . 
  our gass now comes from norway , we have nordbalt electricity cable with sweden and a swedish banking system . 
  during interwar period '' [ baltoscandia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ) '' concept was developed . 
  sweden supported and helped us a lot in restoring our own country and building it after lithuania declared independence . 
  more about lithuanian-swedish relations can be read here http://www.litemb.se/se/en/welcome-to-lithuania/lithuania-and-sweden . 
  lithuania is a more liberal and less religious country than poland and russia , but majority of people are still more conservative than swedish and norwegian people . 
  calling it a baltic country will never be a mistake and you wo n't offend anyone ( if you disagree that lithuania or baltic states is/are a northern european country/ies ) . 
  oligarchs got ta eat, 
  better to throw it out or destroy ? 
  you reap what you sow, 
  another opportunity to fuck with it 's neighbours . 
  itt : island people thinking that east only benefited from eu . 
  no stupid regulations that increased prices , no loss of competitiveness , no massive brain drain , no massive loss of working age people to the west , no loss of sovereignty , no no only benefits . 
  eat your 3-5x larger cake , m8 . 
  hypocritical .
