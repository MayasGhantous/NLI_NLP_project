   the three baltic republics want to switch their electricity grid from a russian to a european system , but moscow fears the move will cut off power to the country 's isolated and heavily armed kaliningrad district . 
  using cold war definitions like op, 
  nazis have overtaken ~ ~ new york ~ ~ washington !, 
  itt : ignorant western europeans thinking that without eu funds eastern europeans would live in dirt shacks . 
   you have to understand that our school english classes are just terrible . 
  and why is that ? 
  dubbed tv is the norm everywhere in the world . 
  [ you made me feel weird about myself ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bgjfh5bh.jpg ), 
  i 'm not arguing with you if russia will invade tomorrow . 
  your comment was pretty ignorant , so i wrote a couple of things why russia would invade lithuania . 
  your soviet union nostalgist leaders and / r/russia users are n't as logical as you are . 
  baltic sea port , land connection to kaliningrad , expanded influence zone , one less nato country bordering russia ... ? 
  the great samogitian-silesian commonwealth, 
  for native belorussian speakers, 
  the obvious choice is litland or litua/littua, 
  should we carry mirrors or wear stab proof vests ? 
  outwards, 
  should , but ca n't . 
  polish `` w '' is the same `` v '' sound . 
  yes , totally . 
  ewelina mickiewicz and evelina mickievicz completely different names . 
  it 's unrecognizable . 
  wow , you di n't annex estonia in that map . 
  stop being bullies and annex it too , like all the other finno-ugric places . 
  uk or porn filters ?

   when i used to live in lithuania 5-6 years ago , beeing called a pole was a insult . 
  i remember it was mostly a villager thing and a joke thing in cities . 
  at least that was my personal experience . 
  ( vilnius , mol\u0117tai , videni\u0161kiai ... )  but i feel like eastern lithuania always was nicer to polest than the western lithuania . 
  little interaction with polish minority on the west side, 
  how do we treat them differently from other minorities ? 
  latvians and lithuanians are last baltic people ... no historical animosity ... baltic way ... and etc. 
  i 'd say it 's the opposite actually . 
  we do n't have anything against poland . 
  no revanchistic feelings towards you . 
  bunch of decadent american capitalists are making dollars off a communist icon . 
  that 's the greatest thing i saw this week . 
  you described my weekends . 
  minus the dieing part , unless you mean dieng inside . 
   to think that , russia would alienate a potential member in his little club is a bit ridiculous . 
  we 're talking about russia . 
  that 's more than likely . 
  latvians were too, 
  why all these swedes hate jews ? 
  who would teach the locals if everyone left ? 
  so the whole population of baltic states should move to germany since everyone is earning 3-5 times less ? 
  if it was lithuania , it would be portrayed as discrimination against minority teachers by polish media . 
  like it was with schools being closed in lithuania . 
   to rely on `` x country '' sums up the whole eu foreign policy, 
  it would be the same as dissolving it edit : and easier, 
  you have been banned from / r/russia, 
  anything beyond left , left-centre and centre is literally hitler . 
   bringing up unrelated things or just making shit up . 
  for example ? 
   remind me , how am i exactly butthurt ?

  right ? '', 
  < . .  `` because if the answer is yes , you 're a moron . 
  and the fact that you actually think albanians are slavic paired with your apparent inability to read makes you someone who is n't worth talking or listening to . 
  looking through your comment historically also shows that you have no idea what haplogroups are and think that they prove that balts had `` finnic ancestors . '', 
  open a book , do some research , or actually read something at some point and maybe you 'll learn something for the first time in your life . '', 
  i can guess by the tone of the message  so out of everything , you chose to single out his mentioning of albanians ? 
  is that a crime ? 
  is there a censure on what i can discuss ? 
  what interests me ? 
  question half-truths or facts ? 
   again , remind me where is implies that there 's a special relationship between balto-slavic languages and the albanian language that 's not shared between others ? 
  or where he says that albanian is closer to a baltic language than it is to a slavic language ? 
  nowhere , you 're making shit up . 
   he groups the two together by saying balto-slavic , but actually reading is beneath you . 
  so i was interested what is the connection between albanian and baltic languages . 
  op should n't generalize such a huge complex language group if he does n't want to be questioned . 
   really does show that you 're a bit of a moron . 
  look at albanian word usage and grammatical structure . 
  but then again , reading is too good for you , eh ? 
  < ...  but maybe you 're just a diamond in the rough and a super-genius unlike your countrymen , who are lowly imbeciles ? 
  < . .  and if my `` american education '' is showing , that must be hard for you , being lithuanian and all . 
  i want to inform you that personal attacks and hate speech directed towards an entire group of people like an ethnicity , religion or nationality are against the rules of this subreddit . 
   do you honestly believe i went through your comments and read all of them carefully ? 
  you must feel extremely self important , thinking that i carefully examined all your comments and their context . 
  then do n't bring up unrelated things . 
   why the denial of the fact that balts and slavs are linguistically closer to each other than any other language group ? 
  quote me where i denied that . 
   get over it and stopped being so butthurt . 
  it 's ironic that you 're the one actually butthurt . 
  to quote you :  it does n't even say they 're in the same `` language group '' , but you did n't read any of it because reading is hard and you 're too good and important to do it . 
  right ? 
  by the way , what do the albanians have anything to do with this ? 
  do you actually think they 're slavic ? 
  because if the answer is yes , you 're a moron . 
  and the fact that you actually think albanians are slavic paired with your apparent inability to read makes you someone who is n't worth talking or listening to . 
  looking through your comment historically also shows that you have no idea what haplogroups are and think that they prove that balts had `` finnic ancestors . '',

  --  it does n't even say they 're in the same `` language group '' , but you did n't read any of it because reading is hard and you 're too good and important to do it . 
  '' ** the balto-slavic language group ** traditionally comprises the baltic and slavic languages , belonging to the indo-european family of languages . '', 
  nice of you to paste a wiki article without reading it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages  by the way , what do the albanians have anything to do with this ? 
  read the person 's message i replied to . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3p3ylu/destruction_of_serbian_heritage_in_kosovo/cw3ijrd  do you actually think they 're slavic ?
