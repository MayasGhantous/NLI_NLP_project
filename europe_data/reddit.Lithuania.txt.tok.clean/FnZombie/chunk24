  no , i think they have more in common with their south slavic neighbours than balts or baltic languages . 
   looking through your comment historically also shows that you have no idea what haplogroups are and think that they prove that balts had `` finnic ancestors . '', 
  i 'm linking my comment because apparently you ca n't read https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3p0scz/genetic_maps_of_europe/cw27gdg  or ** our ** and ** finnic ** ancestors mated with local inhabitants . 
  your american education is showing , friend . 
  thanks , you posted a wiki article about heterogeneous language group . 
  now explain how albanian language is `` closely related '' to baltic languages , which never had any contact with it . 
  especially knowing the fact that baltic and slavic languages are mutually unintelligible . 
  should be interesting . 
  who are these balto-slav people ? 
  `` punkt '' from latin `` punctum '' . 
   russians did some really terrible stuff to their country in the past off the top of my head : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_partition_of_poland https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_press_ban https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_lithuania https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_priboi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania ) http://www.interpretermag.com/25-years-ago-gorbachevs-economic-blockade-failed-to-keep-lithuania-in-the-ussr/ http://energytransition.de/2014/04/paying-the-gas-piper/ no apologies , no reparations , `` we are right because fuck you , labusi '' attitude . 
  oh you left soviet union - blockade ; oh you said something bad about us - blockade ; oh you do n't like soviet union - stop being buthurt . 
  you have non-citizens in your country - blockade , oh it was actually latvia , my mistake - blockade . 
  do n't join nato or eu - you belong to our influence zone !, 
  you do n't like our troops , rockets and planes near you border ? 
  stop being so russophobic !, 
  lithuania is litterally oppresing russia . 
  you 're not a real country , you 're just washington 's jewish project to piss us off . 
  you 're a young country created after dissolution of su !, 
  you leaving su was illegal . 
   is it exclusively from ussr era mistreatement or is it a rivalry with deeper roots ? 
  it has roots since the creation of lithuanian and russian states respectively, 
  or our and finnic ancestors mated with local inhabitants . 
   i want them to treat poles not as subhumans what kind of a reality do you live in ? 
  agree, 
  i do n't want to anger or offend our ally ;-), 
  on average, 
  literally today i tripped and accidentally oppresed your minority . 
  that man should do a 360 and walk away, 
   now they will be able to import russian gas via germany and poland at even higher prices actually the price might be the same . 
  russia loved artificially rising prices for the baltics because of it 's monopoly . 
  but but soviet union was union of friendship , not russian empire 2.0 !, 
  queen lenin 's bridge ? 
  germany ? 
  anything less than 10 % is literally obama 's communism, 
  but you 're the one lost, 
  you must be the author of red dalia, 
  idk if that 's relevant , they like to put spooky-ghost costumes on their women :d, 
   red dalia i lol ` ed  you are ass just kissing a different ass this time . 
  everyone kisses everyone 's ass . 
  you 're just buthurt that we are not kissing the one you like to kiss . 
  i see a comment like this written by russians all the time . 
  do n't you understand that we just do n't like your country that antagonizes us all the time ? 
  it 's not just politicians . 
  lithuania yes  they will be accommodated at the refugee centre in rukla oh god , makaronai will be the least of refugee problems ... 
  see , russia , release 6 political prisoners and eu will temporary lift sanctions . 
  did n't you know that ethiopia was in europe ? 
  we could n't into space, 
  and `` cave '', 
  amber has been very important to lithuanians . 
  if you ever visit lithuania , people will offer you to buy souvenirs made of amber . 
  it 's a national thing . 
   we took the russian flag kva ? 
  you 're not gon na fool anyone , mr. slovenian person . 
  you took the duchy of carniola flag . 
  i did a presentation . 
  i have slovenian friends . 
  do you want to be known as mountain-russians or slavic-germans ? 
   a crest which supposedly causes cancer and autism the slovenian absesion with the mountain triglav ca n't be healthy, 
  why not just crown him already ? 
  what is polish architecture ? 
   to see the difference you are going to riga and coastal lithuania ( more specifically the klaipeda ) to see the actual difference . 
  to riga and memel ? 
  to former livonian city and german city ? 
  so poland has polish architecture and lithuania , belarus , ukraine , latvia has german ? 
   yeah , old town looks german --  your old town is polish !, 
  are those supposed to be insults ? 
  mostly both, 
  lithuania was never ruled by germans and was the first country to form it 's own national state out of the three baltic countries hence the difference in architectural style . 
  edit : i 've read my comment again and it looks like a little bit too harsh reply . 
  i just wanted to say that latvia 's and estonia 's architecture is different from lithuania 's , because it was influenced by germanic style . 
  ( see livonia/terra mariana and etc. 
  can you expand on that ? 
  how polish architecture is different from any other former plc country ? 
  why and how it is unique to poland ? 
  what is the `` lithuanian city look '' and how it is different from `` polish look '' ? 
  and etc. 
  i would love to know more . 
   we 're more interestend in nordic & baltic cooperation than just baltic do n't lie to us , you 'll just run away the first chance you get :'(, 
   and when you became independent , there was a bloody war in your country , the russian troops did n't want to go . 
  that was 1991 wait , what war ? 
  in what way are baltics are so important to russia that usa has to do everything to ruin the relanshionship between them ? 
  why since our idependance has russia punished us with highest gass prices in europe and sanctions ? 
  i 'm pretty sure russia 's neighbours feel animosity to it without anyone interfering . 
  the question of solidarity is only raised when it does n't benefit germany . 
  elect a lithuanian ruler again , 
   if getting billions of euro if that was the case . 
  if eu members gave charity without taking anything in return . 
  edit : i would like to copy/paste my old comment since people apparently are so delusional and idealistic about the whole eu funding . 
   east and west are engaged in a quid pro quo agreement where eastern europe opens up their markets to western businesses and west supplies the east with structural funds to make up for their lack of competitiveness , further enlargement of their middle class and masive loss of working age people and brain drain . 
  please tell me what will be the benefits of taking syrian refugees ( or should i say `` germany 's guests '' ? 
  since they were invited by merkel ) who btw will be illiterate since they wo n't know native languages of their host country 's ? 
  i find it ludicrous to impose the quotas while there exists such unequal living standards within eu . 
  is germany going to pay for them ? 
  i also want to ask you , where is germany 's european solidarity regarding nord stream deal with russia which will make it possible for russia to blackmail half of continent ? 
  germany regarding ( now canceled ) south stream was `` do n't do it , what about european solidarity ?! '' . 
  how should we understand this `` european unity '' ? 
  that 's the thing we have as long as we 're doing exactly what germany tells to ? , 
  it 's a lithuanian with a belarusian flair, 
  i thought that was the balkans ...
