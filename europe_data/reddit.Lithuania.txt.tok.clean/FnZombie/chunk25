   yellow , green and red variation is also very common - many african countries use it but not in europe . 
  yeah , we should have a variation of red , white and blue . 
  so original . 
   the baltics is eastern europe by any criteria - geographic , demographic , economic , geo-political ... not in geography . 
  if you take all three baltic states as one entity and compare it 's latitude to denmark , it 's the same . 
   demographic huh ? 
   geo-political being western alligned makes you eastern european ? 
   you ca n't into nordic this is such a common mistake to make . 
  mixing up geographical region name `` northern europe '' with a geopolitical term encompassing geographical and cultural region - `` nordic countries '' . 
  how is following nordic model , having nordic banking system and being part of northern region cooperation organisations like nordic battlegroup , nordic council or nb8 makes us eastern european countries again ? 
  you can view baltic states however you like , but that wo n't change geography . 
  they should be grateful because they 're being taken advantage of ? 
  based on historical , ethnical and linguistic ignorance ? 
   two eastern europeans are in custody regarding this murder . 
  if you do n't understand why . 
  let me help you . 
  they were in custody because they are the suspects of the murder . 
  the guy replied to a person who said `` it must be ukrainians '' with this message  probably lithuanians , because most of us are russianphobic . 
  implying that lithuanians killed the russian because of his ethnicity , acording to him , because of their russophobia . 
   not sure if you feel threatened , insulted or why you are so mad are you projecting your own feelings on to me ? 
  because i dont feel any of that . 
  you can gather all the proof you can , but , sadly , europhobic russia will deny it no matter what . 
  see the comment chain . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3noyel/76_tall_russian_man_murdered_in_ireland/cvq0132 https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3noyel/76_tall_russian_man_murdered_in_ireland/cvq2ffd https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3noyel/76_tall_russian_man_murdered_in_ireland/cvq312o sub 's iq is dropoing by the minute ... 
  by reading the damn article and comprehending the context . 
  russophobia is a hostile behavior such as discrimination and violence on the basis of russian ethnicity . 
   i 'm afraid of snakes , does n't mean i go around killing them . 
  i 'm afraid of spiders , i kill them all the time . 
  also , homophobes are afraid of gays or have irrational hatred for them , some of them attack/kill gay people . 
  ha ha , what a load of horseshit . 
  edit : instead downvoting please post me any source other than rt where russians are being killed , beaten up or mistreated in lithuania because of their ethnicity , thanks in advance , comrades . 
  you heard it wrong . 
  baumkuchen is not \u0160akotis . 
  what does that have to do with democracy in belarus and russia ? 
  yeah ... no . 
   not the kind of country that would ensure belarus ' democracy belarus is much worse than russia, 
   estonia is a scandinavia country damn , estija , not even suomija could into that, 
  you wrote italy in * italics * he he, 
  i 'd say it 's any suffix that has the letter '' \u0116 \u0117 '' in it . 
  that 's unique to us . 
   refugees refuse ** salaries ** from 1200 lev in bulgaria , they were small . 
  it 's not welfare . 
  in lithuanian `` kur\u010dias '', 
  taken from germany and given to france ( treaty of versailles ) , taken from france and transferred to lithuania ( klaip\u0117da convention ) , then in 1939 lithuania transferred the region to nazi germany ( 1939 german ultimatum to lithuania ) , 1945 memel territory was incorporated into the lithuanian ssr . 
   so how is that different from crimean annexation ? 
  crimean annexation is illegal and only recognized by ex-soviet/soviet-aligned buddies . 
  lithuania already gave the city back to germany once . 
  currently , germany has no legal claim on klaip\u0117da . 
   it does not matter if we took it from french or german , though it was former german city . 
  key words being '' ** was ** former ** german city ** '' . 
  last time klaip\u0117da was given to lithuania by soviet union with city population of around 50 people at the end of the war . 
   so , this is a valid reason to discriminate against a significant part of population of a country , right ? 
  they are not being discriminated against . 
   no , they are not . 
  99 % of them or their parents did n't live in estonia before illegal occupation and population `` transfer '' . 
   laws segregating its population into `` good '' citizens and `` bad '' citizens no such laws exists . 
  if that was true , where is european court of human rights looking ? 
  where are the sanctions against estonia ? 
  i suggest you watch less rt. 
   is there are any other reason for a language native to 25 % of country population not to have an official status in country other than nationalistic sentiments and bias against particular culture ? 
  how about the fact that those people were brought in as colonists while ethnically cleansing native population ? 
  and that `` russkiy mir '' ( russian world ) concept is still alive and well ? 
   and its not like those people are immigrants they are as immigrants as syrian refugees in germany or lithuanians in uk . 
  kovno and vilna are just russian and german translations of kaunas and vilnius . 
  are you sure you read your own quote ? 
  or what is the problem ? 
   under the treaty of versailles after world war i , klaip\u0117da and the surrounding klaip\u0117da region ( memel territory ) were ** detached from germany and made a protectorate of the entente states . 
  ** ** the french became provisional administrators of the region ** until a more permanent solution could be worked out . 
  both lithuania and poland campaigned for their rights in the region . 
  however , it seemed that the region would become a free city , similar to the free city of danzig . 
  not waiting for an unfavorable decision , the ** lithuanians decided to stage the klaip\u0117da revolt , take the region by force , and present the entente with fait accompli . 
  ** the revolt was carried out in january 1923 while western europe was distracted by the occupation of the ruhr . 
  the germans tacitly supported the action , while the ** french offered only limited resistance . 
  [ 8 ] ** the ** league of nations protested the revolt , but accepted the transfer in february 1923 ** . 
  ** the formal klaip\u0117da convention was signed in paris on 8 may 1924 ** , securing extensive autonomy for the region . 
   you call a city by it 's proper name on a map and in a language in which you currently converse so `` king 's mountain '' ? 
  or just [ k\u00f6nigsberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k\u00f6nigsberg ) ? 
   renaming and giving back memel anytime soon ? 
  renaming ? 
  back to it 's [ old prussian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_prussians ) name `` memelis '' ? 
  giving back ? 
  to france ? 
  any french guys here who would like a city thousands of kilometers away from france ? 
  let me just remove some letters at the end and i 'll be latvian, 
  source : http://alphadesigner.com/blog/europe-most-popular-given-male-names/, 
  yeah , as in who 's time it was to eat macaron . 
  refugees hate macarons . 
   just the nordics thing ? 
  what does that mean to refugees in estonia ? 
  citation needed for lithuania refusing to accept refugees . 
  or are you just a bigot to whom `` eastern europeans '' are all the same ? 
  that snowball though, 
  the second one reminds me of our [ vilnius district prosecutor 's office building ] ( http://g1.dcdn.lt/images/pix/file41518539_7c530e2c.jpg ) . 
  i 'm not sure how this relocation is supposed to work if there is a huge economical disparity between eu states . 
  with free movement available to refugees they will just move to wealthier countries . 
   only people in bulgaria and romania earn less than lithuanians and ~ 12 other european countries . 
  [ map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) . 
  it 's cheap not to compare with countries outside of european union . 
  i 'm a prince living in saudi arabia but i make about 100 times the average latvian salary . 
  it is n't even close to evening out .
