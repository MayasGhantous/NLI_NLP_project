  if there 's `` new sad '' , there should be also `` old sad '' ?

   russia would be the most undeveloped country in europe with tsar ' , boyars , and 95 % of peasants . 
  it 's sad that every outcome is the same for russia, 
  compare baltic states with russia , belarus , moldova and ukraine . 
  eastern europe as a cultural region has it 's main characteristics consisting in byzantine , orthodox , and some turco-islamic influences . 
  baltic states have none of that . 
  hence why such cultural annual events like [ nordic-baltic midsummer ] ( http://www.norvegija.lt/news_and_events/news/nordic-baltic-midsummer-celebration-at-the-vilnius-university-botanical-garden-in-kairnai/#.v_uqw_l96uk ) celebrations ( [ video from 2014 which was held in vilnius ] ( https://youtu.be/zghkokwucxc ) ) and nordic-baltic choral festival ( [ example ] ( https://youtu.be/o_o9uvya81i ) ) take place . 
  baltic states and nordic countries cooperate very closely in the northern region in such forms like the northern future forum , nordic-baltic eight , nordic battlegroup , nordic-baltic transition support unit ( [ here 's a video of latvian soldiers celebrating the summer solstice with scandinavians in afghanistan ] ( https://youtu.be/xpnphcebr3m ) ) and other . 
  not to mention the support in regaining independence and heavy investments from the nordic countries . 
  in most cases - yes . 
  because we 're totally best buddies, 
  do n't bother , it 's a waste of time and nobody wins in the end . 
  the relations between poland and lithuania is a rocky one . 
  last month a polish official jan parys said that it would be difficult to convince poland 's troops to defend lithuania because `` we have problems with the polish minority in lithuania '' . 
  [ this article summarizes the relations ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/02/poland-and-lithuania ) .

  old . 
  lithuania joined the euro zone in 2015 . 
   herkus mantas wants to speak with you . 
  have a flag with autumn colors 2 . 
  autumn depression 3 . 
  highest suicide rates in europe, 
   this is what this referendum is about . 
  this referendum is cheap populism by a cheap populist . 
  apparently , helping southern states will bring the end of days . 
  nonsense . 
  finland is a full member of the nordic council and it was in a unique position of not being occupied , the three baltic states were n't so fortunate . 
  naturally , people stopped referring to finland as a `` baltic state '' . 
  lithuania was a founding member of the baltic entente , and even before gaining independence from russian empire all three countries and finland regularly met to discuss collectively the signing of peace treaties with russia and later to discus their common stance on geopolitical issues . 
  it would be very weird not to be called a baltic state when lithuania is an ethnic country of baltic people . 
  also , apparently , `` baltic '' is a dirty word for finns . 
   considering how different history of lithuania and latvia is . 
  yet in the first half of the 20th century public figures from both latvia and lithuania seriously considered creating one country . 
  but unfortunately like the baltic league ( an alliance of baltic and scandinavian countries against potential german and russian aggression ) it was n't meant to be . 
  from the 18th century latvian , lithuanian and estonian histories are very similar . 
  i doubt that any of those old farts know how internet works or how massive youtube is . 
  you got me worried there that we did a sudden flip and lithuania went full belarus with your dramatic post . 
  it 's just a proposal by the homosovieticus party and it wo n't pass . 
  ~ ~ lithuania was the first country to land on the moon ~ ~ lithuania was the first country to launch a man into space edit : i forgot we were on the wrong side, 
   plenty of people here will criticize russia for taking credit for russian empire victories yet immediately proceed to call russian empire 's crimes `` russian '' . 
  after all , starting from the 18th century baltic german nobility increasingly assumed leading posts in the russian imperial government , russia was ruled by a german dynasty of holstein-gottorp , and baltic germans provided a well-educated westernized elite for the russian empire . 
  i agree , soviet union = / = russian empire 2.0 , after all , the communist revolution started in the emirate of bukhara ( or was it in russia ? 
  ) , in soviet union everyone was forced to learn `` friendship of nations language '' of uzbek ( or was it russian ? ), 
  and all the orders came from the capital - yerevan ( or was it moscow ? 
  you wrote a meme that gets repeated by shills in delfi comment section and proposed such a bright idea of `` let 's focus on domestic problems '' ( never heard this before , genius idea !, 
  why nobody thought about that ? 
  you know , one or the other is not ignored when making policies ) , and then mixed up domestic and security issues , like ignoring our security somehow would give you better shoes . 
   you had everything given to you to build a normal western-europe nation and here we are 25 years later , still blaming someone . 
  we 're a normal western nation , we did n't end up as belarus or ukraine and 25 years later we still have the same threat next door , also this is an interview about security , not blaming someone . 
   their transfer to latvia was legal at the time according to whatever laws were in effect . 
  population transfers were n't legal . 
  the whole occupation was n't recognized by other countries . 
   political games between nation-states really should n't be used as an excuse make their grandchildren non-citizens . 
  exactly , that 's why the successor of the soviet union should have solved the issue of it 's citizens being dislocated in foreign countries long time ago . 
  whoever wanted to be a citizen of latvia already have their citizenship . 
  it 's been 26 years ffs . 
   europe needs to go and is probably going ( esp . 
  eastern europe ) japanese way currently eastern europe is going the japanese way indeed - with seppuku . 
  if you count lithuania in ee , in a economical and ex-communist sense , then our politicians are joyful that `` emigrants are going to foreign countries and gaining knowledge and experience . 
  they will return !, 
  '' , our population went from 3.4 m ( 2004 ) to 2.8 m ( 2016 ) , nope they will not return . 
  we are not losing old people , we 're losing young people . 
  western europe played eastern europe very well , by funding various trivial projects in wastelands while getting young workforce to support their ageing populations . 
  our politicians did nothing to prevent people from leaving for 12 years now . 
  now they talk about `` historical standards of tolerance in grand duchy of lithuania and christian compassion '' ( appealing to nationalists and religious people ) when addressing refugee question . 
  lithuania is cornered and will accept mena people same way uk , germany or sweden did , because it needs working age people , problem is that those people will emigrate as well . 
  if you want state owned propaganda there are subs for that . 
  this is weird . 
  we were told to shut it down by eu , because `` it 's literally chernobyl v2 '', 
   estonia says it has declined an offer from russia to hold talks on baltic sea security . 
  < ...  russian media reports that the kremlin sent similar security talk invitations to nato members latvia , lithuania , and poland , as well as to sweden and finland . 
  to talk about the regional threat from norway or denmark ? 
  \u010cekija in lithuanian, 
   in poland has begun #czarnyprotest ( black protest ) : (  symbolic dressing in black in opposition to criminalize abortion . 
  please support us . 
   turning a poor and rural society into an space , military and social superpower in 30 years but fucking amerika ruined everything , right ? 
  what does the current russian state can be proud of if we exclude the past ? 
  first world standard of living , elimination of corruption , eradication of oligarch mafias , development of peripheries or development of free and open society ? 
  i guess russian citizens can be proud of their leader building a personal cult and establishing himself as the ruler of all russians until his death , getting crimea back and making russia stronk by challenging eu . 
   the socialist reforms all over europe and the world for fear of the population being seduced by communism due to miserable conditions development of welfare state predates soviet union . 
  it 's also not unique for socialism . 
  have a read about it 's history and various models in your spare time . 
  also , if you think that soviet union was socialist , then you might need to do additional reading .
