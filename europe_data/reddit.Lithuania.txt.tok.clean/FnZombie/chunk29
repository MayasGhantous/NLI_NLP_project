  by law , asylum-seekers who are granted refugee status or an alternative status do not have to inform the authorities if they plan to leave the country . 
  they , just as any other resident , have the right to travel around european union . 
  they are not prisoners . 
  he did two major mistakes : * told people not do something * submitted a picture with a cat you reap what you sow . 
  it 's not like we can force people to come here if they would rather go to germany or sweden next door . 
  baltic states agreed to accept eu refugee quotas and they will honor the commitment . 
  latvia , lithuania and estonia are accepting refugees, 
  just a reminder : center of european union = / = center of europe, 
  we do , but we only use it when writing in lithuanian . 
  generally , when writing in english , international/english names are used . 
   the baltics have quite a cruel reputation for what they did , even before the germans came . 
  what did baltic countries do before the germans came there ? 
  if i may ask , what is the reason behind writing polish names for non-polish cities ? 
  must be a counting mistake . 
  nothing a good ol' prison ca n't fix . 
  `` litvinists '' claim that our pagan rulers were belorusians ( at the time kievan rus lands were already christianized ) , grand duchy of lithuania was established by belorusians ( in real world belorusian lands were added after unification of lithuanian `` clans '' / dukes and creation of baltic state ) and lithuanians stole the name `` lithuanian '' from belorusians . 
  it 's not acceptance of their gdl heritage or promotion of belorusian input into gdl , but a complete appropriation of history ( like makedonism ) by extreme nationalists , as a opposition to their politicians flirting with and idealising soviet history . 
  current belarus state associates itself the most with soviet belarus , rather than with `` nationalist '' peoples republic of belarus . 
  it has nothing to do with polish-lithuanian commonwealth or shared transnational heroes , it 's all about `` grand duchy of litva '' and the rulers `` mindovi\u010d , vitouski , gedimihnovski '' . 
  are you a bad comedian or twelve ? 
  what shitstorm ? 
   why would you write a book in polish saying how much of a great country / fatherland lithuania is ? 
  why would you write in english how much of a great country / fatherland ireland , wales or scotland is ? 
  why would you write a book in russian saying how much of a great country / fatherland belarus is ? 
  similar thing . 
  see [ polish-lithuanian identity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) . 
  part of the reason is alcoholism , part is culture ( an old lithuanian saying is `` a lithuanian is happy , when his neighbour 's farmhouse is on fire '' ) , part is the standard of living in post-communist world , part is maybe genetics since we 're related closely with finnic people and there 's a [ hypothesis about genetic suicide in finno-ugrian populations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugrian_suicide_hypothesis ) , which applies to northern russians too . 
  or maybe it 's the weather . 
  [ forest of the gods ] ( https://youtu.be/vtzusnil6fm ) - based on the balys sruoga novel `` diev\u0173 mi\u0161kas / the forest of the gods '' . 
  it 's about his own life experiences as a prisoner in stutthof concentration camp , where he was sent in march 1943 . 
  [ knygne\u0161ys / book smuggler ] ( https://youtu.be/xxc3ntkawo4 ) - a 19th century historical drama about book-smuggling in lithuania during the time when press in lithuanian language & latin script was banned by the russian empire . 
  no youtube links for the movies bellow , but it 's possible to watch them somewhere on the internet or download them , there should be subtitles available separately if they 're not included .

  [ trailer ] ( https://youtu.be/inkmg9cckqw ) - british/lithuanian film . 
  very [ chavy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chav ) dark comedy , very self-critical , overexagerated eastern european stereotype , heavy on swear words . 
  the director emilis v\u0117lyvis is known for this specific style of movies . 
  ekskursant\u0117 / the excursionist ( the deportee ) . 
  [ trailer ] ( https://youtu.be/smfsqaapw1w ) - the story of a ten year old girl who escapes from a deportee train and goes on a 6000 km long journey back to her homeland . 
  a collaboration between lithuanian and russian actors . 
  vienui vieni / utterly alone - `` set in 1950 , utterly alone powerfully depicts the bloody and brutal treatment meted out by soviet russia , aided by lithuanian collaborators , as it systematically hunts down and kills resistance fighters . 
  reminiscent of the mood of schindler 's list , it pays tribute to the courage and fortitude of daumantas and his fellow fighters as they battle valiantly against the might of stalin 's empire . '', 
  maybe it 's because of the '' \u017d , \u0160 '' sounds . 
  polish is a harsh language like german , it seems like every polish word has a '' \u017e , \u010d , \u0161 , d\u017e '' sound in it . 
  that 's probably true, 
  my friend who hanged himself smoked weed a lot , but that 's not the reason he did it , it seems like he was very committed to end his life . 
  after months in a institution fighting depression and a day before spending time with another friend , the next day he just killed himself . 
  the friend with the gun never drinks alcohol or smokes . 
  he does n't like any alcohol at all . 
  we 're finally number one in europe, 
  my friend hanged himself in his dorm after he returned from a couple of months of therapy . 
  my former university acquaintance 's dad killed himself too . 
  another friend had a gun and told me that one night he wanted to shoot himself , but did n't pull the trigger , now he 's on various medication ( antidepressants , some anti panic-attack pills and etc ) and he seems fine . 
  i 'm not saying russia is the source of all lithuania 's problems . 
  we did exists before uk did their brexit, 
  the closer you 're to russia , the more you want to kill yourself, 
  greece is western , estonia is eastern , france is northern , slovenia is southern . 
  and there is no center . 
  what 's not to understand ? 
  western european culture is obviously the same , there is no difference between spain , england and norway . 
  the same is true for eastern europe , there is no difference between czech republic , macedonia and belarus . 
  `` i want you inside of me , friend '' - russia, 
   and are really the baltics all gravitating around germany ? 
  i do n't remember them being particularly open to taking those refugees . 
  lithuania 's policy in a nutshell : `` copy scandinavia , follow germany '' . 
  i guess some things never change . 
  the scope of refugees being accepted might be small , but nobody is officially protesting against it . 
  [ `` we are prepared to accept refugees immediately , but there are no refugees in italy or greece who agreed to resettle in lithuania , '' ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-lithuania-iduskcn0sk2dt20151026 ) [ lithuania 's approach to refugees : history , compassion and solidarity ] ( https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/opinion/lithuania-s-approach-to-refugees-history-compassion-and-solidarity/ ), 
   paralympics : belarus carries it 's unofficial flag during opening ceremony unity and strong friendship is rare sight between countries though . 
  you 'll need to add - a , - \u0117 , - us , - is endings too and change them based on the [ noun declension ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_declension#table_of_noun_declension_endings ), 
  it was just an example of a typical stuff you can read from polish nationalists on the internet . 
  shitting on us and then being surprised by the lack of fondness . 
  it 's weird . 
  a lithuanian users writes a joke comment and a pole starts a typical chauvinistic rant about fake lithuania . 
  tell us more about insecurities . 
  read your own comment and you 'll know where the hate comes from . 
  you forgot to call lithuania a fake country and boast how you personally christianized it . 
  the thing is grand duchy of lithuania was bilingual , lithuanian language was n't a written language at the time , so old church slavonic was used for writing . 
  playing with fire , my friend, 
  the german one is very true for lithuanian too . 
  who am i kidding ? 
  nobody is learning lithuanian . 
   probably from a germanic language . 
  akin to english `` file '' or maybe from ancient aztec language ? 
  because god forbid if lithuanian has it 's own unique word that is not related to anyone or anything . 
  `` etymology not found '' ? 
  we ca n't have that !, 
   nothing will happen if they cooperate with the authority . 
   ) ) ) , maybe they 'll even get state-funding if they cooperate by providing `` correct '' information like rt , prorussia.tv , tnt , tv center , petersburg -- channel 5 , russia 24 , russia 2 , russia k , ntv , zvezda , rossiya 1 , channel one . 
  they 'd have a better chance with `` pole lives matter '' , not with made up non-issues . 
  could you elaborate , please ? 
  so basically balto-slavic linguistic traits ? 
  we 'd have to invent a new language to get rid of those , or atleast we could try to drop our free stress like latvians did and just a have a fixed initial stress . 
  [ what if i showed you reconstructed balto-slavic words ? ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/category:proto-balto-slavic_lemmas ) . 
  looks familiar ? 
  they 're basically the same or barely changed words we use . 
   if they were noble names they would n't be on the top 10 list , i would think ? 
  yes , but i did n't claim your listed ones were , just a random historic trivia regarding lithuanian noble names . 
  btw [ here 's a list of lithuanian noble family names and their coat of arms if someone is interested ] ( http://www.lbks.lt/apie-mus/atributika/gimines-ir-herbai ) . 
  oh it means `` w '' ? 
  my friend from slovenia told me that lithuanian `` l '' pronunciation is very soft and i sound very cute when i try to say something slovenian .
