  and me knowing how hard russians pronounce their `` l '' letters , i thought it would be similar to the polish `` z , \u0179 , \u017b '' thing . 
  i have to agree on influences on culture and stuff . 
  but on our language development ? 
  which ones ? 
  which elements from the polish language did we adopt and use today ? 
   i do n't get your point as welsh spelling is consistent unlike english i though you asked why `` english pronunciation was already sort of fucked '' , my mistake . 
   i just got eye cancer . 
  please use the ipa or nothing at all . 
  this transcription is fugly , not at all accurate and not very useful as it depends on your english accent it 's from the from the leaked american diplomat notes , not mine . 
  slavic scribes used to `` translate '' names in grand duchy of lithuania regardless of the person 's spoken language and lithuanian nobility loved to polonize their last names to seem more polish . 
  2 jankauskas - jankowski - actually `` jankowski '' would be `` jonauskas '' or `` jonaitis '' , since `` jonas '' and `` jan '' are `` john '' . 
  idk about `` jankauskas '' , might be of polish origin . 
  3 petrauskas - piotrowski - well both have a meaning of `` son of peter '' / `` peter 's son '' 4 . 
  stankevi\u010dius - stankiewicz - most '' - evi\u010d '' last names are of polish , russian origin . 
  vasiliauskas - wasilewski - most likely entirely of slavic origin 6 . 
  \u017dukauskas - \u017bukowski - lithuanian in origin , `` zukas '' - meaning `` rogue '' / `` cheater '' 7 . 
  kavaliauskas - kowalewski - idk about polish meaning , but this one comes from `` kalvis '' - meaning `` blacksmith '', 
   lol . 
  just to spite the poles huh ? 
  no , czechs invented the new writing system since the previous one was less efficient and lithuanians adopted it too since it made our lives easier , we already have very long words , no need for extra letters and ambiguity ( why write `` w '' if our `` v '' sound is soft ? 
  why write '' \u0142 '' if our `` l '' is the same , we do n't have a hard `` l '' sound anyway ? 
  why write two letters `` sz '' for '' \u0160 '' sound when we can write one instead ? ) . 
  poles stayed with the old system . 
  well lithuanian `` d\u017e '' would be polish `` drz '' . 
  lithuanian '' \u017e '' - polish `` rz '' . 
  czech spelling would be closer . 
  it would be a mistake to say that polish language influenced lithuanian language development since lithuanian is more archaic and more conservative language than the former , having preserved many indo-european features . 
  also the ruling class of lithuania spoke entirely polish after the union and rejected lithuanian , while village folk preserved and spoke primarily lithuanian . 
  although , polish writing system was used in the past until it was replaced by the more efficient alphabet ( for us ) , and some loan words were in use until lithuanian language was standardized and most of the slavic and germanic loans were replaced by lithuanian equivalents . 
  in lithuanian , finnish and other languages the pronunciation of words is exactly derived from the characters in the words . 
  while for languages such as english , you can not accurately pronounce the words simply based on the spelling of the words . 
  for exampe : '' ** g ** eor ** g ** e '' , '' ** g ** ood '' written in lithuanian would be '' ** d\u017e ** ior ** d\u017e ** '' and '' ** g ** \u016bd '' ( \u016b - long u or oo sound ) ; '' ** j ** esus '' and `` mid ** g ** et '' , `` tar ** g ** et '' - '' ** d\u017e ** yzus '' ( y - is long `` i '' sound ) , `` mi ** d\u017e ** et '' and `` tar ** g ** et '' ; '' ** c ** oo ** k ** '' and `` dan ** c ** e '' - '' ** k ** \u016b ** k ** '' and `` den ** c ** '' . 
  do n't get me started on `` two , to , too '' and silent letters that you do n't pronounce ( wednesday , island ) . 
  i loved when wikileaks leaked that american diplomats had written notes on how to pronounce lithuanian names : dainius kreivys ( day-nee-yuss kray-vees ) raimundas palaitis ( ray-moon-duss pah-lay-tis ) algirdas \u0160emeta ( al-gir-duss she-meh-tah ) remigijus \u0160ima\u0161ius ( reh-mig-ee-yuss shi-mah-shyuss ), 
  i know that the disinformation by kremlin funded media is very strong , but common man , you think putin does n't know which territories he occupies ? 
  you get out . 
   i am sure poland , lithuania had some issues about towns . 
  post independence ? 
  not really . 
  both countries agreed to reject any territorial claims . 
  although there was a long dispute regarding territorial waters between lithuania and latvia , that ended in 1999 , when both parties agreed to just draw a straight line as the border between territorial waters . 
  eu already struggles to deal with rising number of immigrants . 
  not to mention terrorist or xenophobic attacks . 
  and the russian minority has been used as a political tool by so called `` evil russia '' . 
  so eu would be flooded with russians, 
  russia has a population of 140m + people, 
  no , [ it 's against udija ] ( https://youtu.be/xd3dm2iumc8?t=4m10s ) . 
  yes , i dug out my homegrown potatoes last weekend . 
  [ white potatoes like this ] ( http://www.sos03.lt/files/images/tikros%20bulves.jpg ) are generally more popular than the red commie ones , that 's why i forgot all about them . 
  op is slovakian, 
  notice how the red paprikas and tomatoes are placed in a shape of a triangle ? 
  there has to be order even in a desperate situation like this . 
  potatoes are n't red . 
   good luck with replacing huge russia 's market china , us-eu deal , eu-canada deal . 
   good luck with replacing cheap russian energy sources for former soviet colonies it was never cheap , so this does n't matter . 
  there is norway gass , iran gass , etc. 
  so russia could invade even more territories and create even more frozen conflicts ? 
  it 's more realistic that russia gets invaded than nato is removed from russia 's borders . 
  there would n't be a need for nato if russia was n't a threat to peace in the region to begin with . 
   slovakia 's prime minister , robert fico , called on the eu to end the sanctions after meeting president vladimir putin in moscow , saying they had harmed both the eu and russia but influenced absolutely nothing . '', 
  `` my immediate reaction to comments like that is that if we have reached absolutely nothing , then let 's add more sanctions , '' lithuania 's linas linkevicius told reuters during a visit to norway . 
  ^ lol . 
  apart from this he just repeated the same thing all the foreign ministers agreed on during this year 's nordic-baltic eight meeting . 
  so nothing controversial . 
  i thought estonia would be number one . 
  quite surprising . 
  so what ? 
  so people upvoted a picture they liked ? 
  no , these are the symptoms of a [ banana republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_republic ), 
  yes, 
  except this has little to do with intermarium . 
   the enormous market is crucial for lithuania , which lost the highly profitable russian market in the wake of the food embargo announced by russia in august of 2014 . 
  lithuanian dairies used to export about 20-40 percent of their output to russia . 
  this is huge for lithuania . 
  exporters should use the opportunity to establish business relations with chinese importers . 
  i guess it 's time to stop inviting dalai lama ... 
  / r/russia subreddit lives in denial and self-constructed reality . 
  you wo n't see anything negative on the front page because there 's nothing wrong in utopia .

  i always wondered if latvians and estonians rise all of the three [ baltic states ' flags during their independence day like we do ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/oto38jnfdte?t=1m44s ), 
  looks to me that he 's playing a [ soviet lowlife - gopnik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gopnik ) - rapper rather . 
  sounds like there 's whole science behind squatting . 
  squattology ? 
  do n't call it a comeback , it 's been like that since 1917 . 
  happy re-birth day , baltbros !, 
  [ praise the sun ] ( https://youtu.be/eudwecwklbw ), 
  it does n't explain `` pretender date '' . 
  are we supposed to celebrate the day estonia declared it 's independence and not ours ? 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about , our independence was restored on 11 march 1990 . 
  that 1988 act was about estonia 's autonomy in ussr . 
  a couple of months ago . 
  our independence was restored on 11th of march .

  nobody in latvia connect the name j\u0101nis with the public holiday j\u0101\u0146i ? 
  no parent would send their children to prison . 
  surplus military vehicles ? 
  aka some of the cars will be used as spare parts .
