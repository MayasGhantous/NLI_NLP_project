  money well spent . 
  you could dig around your borders with sweden , norway and russia . 
  and then pretend you 're an island ? 
  [ beer being the most important linguistic similarity ] ( http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/51db0d1feab8ea1d52000011-1200-/eurobeer-map.png ), 
  [ yeah , but germans save space between words , it 's very practical ] ( http://static4.fjcdn.com/comments/3773318+_97267c10cce0d01540afa25323a653b8.jpg ) . 
  why call it a `` antiaircraft gun '' `` prie\u0161l\u0117ktuvin\u0117 patranka '' if we could be more efficient and call it `` l\u0117ktuva\u0161aud\u0117 '' or `` l\u0117ktuvpatrank\u0117 '' - `` plane shooter '' or `` plane canon '' ? 
  `` for the classic pig taste ! '', 
  / `` for the classic keul\u0117 taste '' `` keul\u0117 '' is a play on a word `` kiaul\u0117 '' meaning `` pig '' since the sound `` eu '' and `` iau '' are very similar in pronunciation . 
  `` keul\u0117 r\u016bk\u0117 '' ( meaning `` pig smoked '' ) is a play on the name of a classic kid 's story `` e\u017eiukas r\u016bke '' ( `` hedgehog in the fog '' ) . 
  holy shit ... 
  is that a rhetorical question ? 
  the same way it 's reported in every eu country . 
  facts are reported , no need for no fake pictures of planes or stories about neonazis taking over countries or children being nailed to the trees . 
   they could occupy you and not give the capital back if a grandma had a penis , she could be a grandpa . 
   you should be thankful for the capital of your country that you got back only because the soviets decided to do so . 
  and for all the factories and roads . 
  yeah , let 's ignore the fact that lithuania faith was already decided by soviet-nazi alliance . 
  thanks senpai soviet for a piece of land and buttfucking me without lube too . 
  `` hey , i was raped but i 'm thankful for the hotdog that you bought ! '' . 
  do you read out loud what you write ? 
   and if , as you say , lithuanians willfully chose to get vilnius back for their independence , they/you absolutely have no right to bitch about it . 
  there was nothing willful about it . 
  lithuania lost memel because of the nazi german ultimatum , lost it 's pride because of polish ultimatum and lost independence because of soviet ultimatum . 
  bigger countries did whatever they wanted with smaller countries as long the other bigger country did n't mind or could n't do anything . 
   finland for example - they lost the war , but they gave a bloody fight , and for that i respect them . 
  soviet union could n't occupy finland with hundred times larger army and offered a piece treaty . 
  yeah , they got some land , but finland remained independent and built a welfare state . 
  looking at russia , imo finland won in the end . 
  baltic region is undefendable , flat land and against hundred times larger army . 
  going to war would have meant losing even bigger part of the population , just to be replaced and colonized by russian colonists like in k\u00f6nigsberg or crimea . 
   you - as you yourself told just now - could choose to either fight and probably be occupied or get `` cookies '' but become dependent , lithuania chose the later . 
  that 's a moronic oversimplification if i ever saw one . 
  lithuania did n't have any choice , with vilnius or without vilnius lithuania would have been occupied anyway . 
  i 'm 100 % positive that if lithuania did n't have vilnius we and poles would be best buddies right now . 
   anti-russia stories with such strong propaganda hahaha . 
  our anti-russian stories run about lithuanian air-space violations by russian military jets , surprise military drills near our borders and new rockets in kaliningrad , estonian officers getting kidnapped , south ossetian borders magically expanding into georgia and war in ukraine . 
  there 's no need for propaganda when you can just report stuff . 
  comrade , please . 
  then why do they reelect assholes ? 
  yep , journalists virginijus savukynas and jacek komar traveled around lithuania to see all the key places ( [ heart-burial in rasos cementary , the place where he was born and a oak tree dedicated to him ] ( http://imgur.com/a/9xvrg ) , place where he committed a train robbery and etc. ), 
  and they discussed j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski 's background , actions , motives and his love affair with his doctor eugenia lewicka ( [ he even took part in nudist sessions/activities in druskininkai ] ( http://imgur.com/a/iy62w ) since e. lewicka was a promoter of nudism ) . 
  jacek komar is 100 % ethnic polish , but he spoke lithuanian since he lived in the country for 20 years now . 
  in the end the host virginijus savukynas suggested that maybe there should be a monument built to honor pi\u0142sudski in lithuania because it 's pointless to talk about grievances since vilnius is the capital of lithuania anyway and pi\u0142sudski considered himself lithuanian ( samogitian ) and was an important interwar figure to both poland and lithuania . 
  because it was either get vilnius and lose sovereignty or go to war with soviet union and lose sovereignty . 
  baltics accepted the ultimatums , finland went to war because it could . 
  it was all part of soviet occupation plans . 
  so how retarded should we be to be thankful to soviet cunts ? 
  edit : added links for the uneducated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93lithuanian_mutual_assistance_treaty https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occupation_of_the_baltic_states, 
  i did n't see germans and french arguing on reddit about piece of land yet . 
  or germans saying `` das elsass ist mein '' to french in alsace . 
  they probably do count as friends . 
   actually , you should be thanking soviets for that . 
  and all the roads and factories !, 
  a bit of wishful thinking , pinch of exaggeration and overly positivism on top . 
  allies yes , but friends ? 
  something stupid like xx century territorial dispute is still very much relevant and a hot topic where all sides get provoked .

  for example . 
  this is not a geographical map hence the title . 
  `` mitteleuropa '' is a german invention and the concept is older than you . 
  `` kazlauskas '' , slavized `` o\u017eelaitis '' by scribes who used to translate names directly from lithuanian .

  [ russia ai n't like most girls ] ( https://youtu.be/rhuefwlkrky ) . 
  one peculiar thing that both of them shared was that both countries had plans to deport parts of baltic populations to siberia . 
  which is very odd . 
  got me interested, 
   nonetheless , it does n't change the fact that finland had relatively little in common even at that time with the newly independent estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
  the fact is that at time all four of the countries had little in common . 
  now days the only common thing between the three baltic republics is that they we 're occupied ( btw finland got the same ultimatum as lithuania , latvia and estonia , but finland went to war ) and they held hands together during the baltic way . 
  saying finland and estonia had little in common is nonsensical . 
   the finnish inclusion with the baltic states at the time could probably be roughly compared with how today finland is sometimes referred as part of scandinavia . 
  although that term is often used in english synonymously with nordic , its use in the way it 's used today in denmark , norway and sweden started in the 19th century as a way create a new national identity , like with the term baltic states . 
  baltic states is n't a cultural region/term or identity , it 's just a geographical term to refer to the countries to the east of baltic sea . 
  thanks , bulgaria and romania !, 
  britain leaving news every week was getting stale and annoying . 
  none of this changes the fact that all of the four countries were referred to as `` baltic states '' during interwar period . 
  [ you could read this book for example ] ( https://books.google.lt/books?id=u0iragaaqbaj&amp;lpg=pa15&amp;dq=why%20finland%20is%20the%20fourth%20baltic%20state&amp;hl=lt&amp;pg=pa15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) or any other book about the interwar period . 
  ( [ like this one ] ( https://books.google.lt/books?id=pmtdcgaaqbaj&amp;lpg=pt41&amp;dq=why%20finland%20is%20the%20fourth%20baltic%20state&amp;hl=lt&amp;pg=pt41#v=onepage&amp;q=finland,%20a%20fourth%20baltic%20country&amp;f=false ) or [ this one ] ( https://books.google.lt/books?id=ah7obqaaqbaj&amp;lpg=pa157&amp;dq=finland%20baltic%20state&amp;hl=lt&amp;pg=pa157#v=onepage&amp;q=finland%20baltic%20state&amp;f=false ) ), 
  i though turkey was into bdsm stuff since the people elected erdogan, 
  how do you know that it was n't israel ? 
  poland 's territory was partitioned by the austria-hungary , german empire and russian empire . 
  territories of lithuania , latvia , estonia and finland were entirely annexed by russian empire . 
  how so ? 
  nice meme , but after the ww1 the term `` baltic states '' was used to refer to the countries by the baltic sea that had gained independence from russian empire in its aftermath . 
  what image ? 
  most barely know anything about the baltic countries . 
  what is so bad about being `` baltic '' ? 
  because neither estonia or finland are geographically near the baltic sea / s, 
  coming back home . 
  finland used to be the fourth baltic state . 
  their publishers got the money and they 're interested in purchasing them . 
  and our whole video game industry focuses on mobile games . 
  the only pc video game made by a lithuanian studio that i can remember was ` psi : siberian conflict ' . 
  and those radical feminist groups come here and hold conferences talking about how women here are unequal and oppressed by the patriarchy , when we got females holding highest positions in our country . 
  some companies sell licenses to russian publishers , who not only buy cis region license but also baltic licenses , so certain games on steam are paradoxically `` unavailable in your region '' . 
  you have to find the russian version/website/client to actually play . 
  for example , a game called `` dirty bomb '' is available for the whole european region except for latvia and lithuania ( available for estonia ) .
