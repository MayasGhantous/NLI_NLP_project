  poles are n't together with russians against lithuanians . 
  both electoral action of poles in lithuania and russian alliance are pro-russian parties that struggle to get elected individually , so they formed a coalition . 
  half of poles most likely vote for `` homeland union '' - moderate christian party . 
  tomaszewski 's and russian alliance are pro-russian parties . 
  they formed a coalition just to get the votes needed to get elected . 
  most or half of the poles probably vote for the `` homeland union -- lithuanian christian democrats '' .

  that does n't sound like ` acting though ' , that sounds like realpolitik . 
  `` acting though '' is boasting about your nuclear capabilities , talking about bipolar worlds and entitlement to influence zones , holding large military exercises near your borders without notifying your neighbors .

  problem is that our catholic church loves to voice their oppinion on certain topics discussed in the parliament and some politicians meet with them to listen to church 's oppinion for publicity . 
  but there was no religious resurgence in lithuania like in russia . 
  majority of lithuanians identify as a catholic , but in reality most of them are non-practicing . 
  during soviet occupation doing religious stuff was a form of nonviolent resistance against the regime .
