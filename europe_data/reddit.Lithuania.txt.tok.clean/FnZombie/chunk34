  elected politicians and erdogan supporters calling for people to go out to the streets and ignore the curfew . 
  `` go and risk your lives for erdogan , you shits '' in other words ...

  and here i though i would get some sleep . 
  i miss the days when it was relatively calm in europe . 
  he was n't as cool as that german guy julius kaiser . 
  i 'm pretty sure mountain austrians , also known as slovenes , would apply for merkelreich instead . 
  belarus would rather be russia 's region than part of european union . 
  baltic states would apply to join merkelreich since they follow everything germany says and never opposes it ( at least lithuania does ) or kalmar union ( either full members or just observer status ) . 
  great republic of bohemia , moravia and czech silesia together with hungary and poland would be in the same union . 
  now i 'm thinking if it 's czech manwhore or czechman whore ? 
  why is germany not part of austria ?

  a tower is a structure , a building is a permanent structure built as `` a dwelling , shelter , or place for human activities or for storage '' . 
  eiffel tower - a structure ; random hotel/skyscraper/supermarket / museum are buildings in other words . 
  small country , low population ... so essentially the whole country . 
  capital city 's nickname is `` jerusalem of the north '' ( `` athens of the north '' too , but not relevant to the current discussion ) and lithuania calls itself `` marijos \u017dem\u0117 '' ( mary 's land ) . 
  most are non practicing and if you ask them what denomination of christianity they belong to , they 'll be confused since most of them think catholicism = true christianity . 
  tv tower is the tallest structure/tower in lithuania . 
  europa tower is the tallest skyscraper ( building ) . 
  it should n't be a suprise then if it 's neighnouring countries start build defense shields . 
  they have the right to . 
  because poland will reclaim western belarus any day now, 
  you know that russia put nuclear-capable iskander missiles in kaliningrad , and that there is a-135 anti-ballistic missile system in moscow and that russia is planing to put more nuclear-capable missiles along nato border by 2019 ? 
  should nato too put nuclear missiles around nato 's borders ? 
  he 's saying that belarus is a special snowflake that does n't belong to any spheres of influence . 
  while in reality , belarus is in russia 's sphere of influence . 
  he said himself that military and political cooperation between russia and belarus is increasing and not with the west . 
  every lithuanian city in civ games are polish , except vilnius which is a city-state .

  if you want a short version : europeans evolved from trowing poop at each other to trowing poop at each other on the internet . 
  ----- on a serious note , i too would like to see a documentary like that . 
  i sometimes imagine kremlin as a tumblrina who gets triggered and provoked by usa 's patriachy , nato not cheking it 's priviliges , all kremlin 's interests mater , supresion of russia 's influence zone by the establishment , soviet-shaming , not refering to rus ' as world superpower , assuming it 's position in geopolitics and etc. 
  sorry for a shit post , i just had to share . 
  well , you see , comrade , when you say `` ussr was bad '' , what you 're actually saying is `` heil hitler , nazism was n't that bad '' . 
  here 's an opposite example , comrade : `` imperial japan did bad things '' , in other words `` mao zedong was pretty cool guy '' . 
  it 's interesting that belarus identifies itself with black ruthenia or western belarus in this video . 
  also , video ends with the year 1991 before their flag was changed back to the soviet one in 1995 .

  1263 grand duchy of lithuania is established 1387 christianization of lithuania ( this time for real , although it takes time to become fully christianized ; samogitia was the last ethnic region of lithuania to become christianized in 1413 ) .

  poland and lithuania ceased to exist as independent nations ( most people agree that it 's all polish fault ;-) ) . 
  1831 and 1863 the local nobility led revolts against the russian rule attempting to restore the polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  1865 printed lithuanian language was banned in the russian empire . 
  1918 the subsequent german losses in the western front led to a possibility to declare independence of lithuania on february 16th .

  weirdly enough majority of reconstructed [ proto-balto-slavic words are just lithuanian words ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/category:proto-balto-slavic_nouns ) . 
  so if anyone wants to hear how proto balto-slavic sounded like they can just listen to lithuanian language . 
   they share like 1 % more words than any other indo-european language . 
  that 's not how grouping languages work . 
  if that was the case [ estonian would be grouped with germanic languages ] ( http://i.imgur.com/in62cnn.png ) , but as we know finno-ugric languages are n't indo-european . 
  also , could you provide a source for that claim ? 
  all three of them are not indo-european languages, 
  my prediction is that there will be more remain votes by a small margin ( ~ 54 % ), 
  i did n't say lithuanians were nazi sympathizers . 
  nobody knew about nazi atrocities at the start of the war . 
  common folk simply thought that germans came to save them from the red pleague and restore lithuania 's independence . 
  it was widely thought at the time that germany came to liberate lithuania from russia . 
  they did n't , vilnius was given to lithuania by soviet union and all the population transfers was organized by su . 
   if balts were so against ** socialism ** and ** slavs ** , then why you did n't fight like the finns did ?
