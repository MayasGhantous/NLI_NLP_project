  seven years later there is n't any proof of any alleged cia prisons in lithuania . 
  first of all , i was n't referring to these specific pens . 
  it 's a random picture i took , because i could n't believe that they 're asking such a price for basic pens . 
  secondly , how is the current german price of this pen relevant to prices in lithuania a few years back ? 
  there 's already a difference with current prices : german 4,32 eur and lithuanian 2,89 eur . 
  lastly , $ 0.30-0 .90 were normal prices for a plastic pen a few years back . 
  [ i do n't recall shitty plastic pens costing 5 or 10 litas in grocery stores . 
  first price is in euros , second in litas . 
  the mental gymnastics ... 
  [ you mean this ?

  `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . '', 
  some guy from russia, 
  thanks ;-), 
  it 's either \u010ce\u010dia or chechia, 
   but recently there is a lot of tensions on political and human level . 
  that 's so 2012, 
  i guess usa or poland ? 
  that would mean paying reparations for every illegally occupied country, 
  nazi racial theories made no sense to begin with, 
  greece is true eastern country, 
   we probably could have hold on our own and probably should have accepted german alliance proposals . 
  that would have meant attacking poland , a casus belli for soviet occupation , western countries would have recognized soviet occupation as legal , we 'd be known as nazi collaborators forever , nazi goverment would have pressured lithuanian government to gather all the jews and give them to the reich , we probably would have been bombed by allies . 
  i think being neutral was the best choice made by interwar goverment . 
   not many like to recall dark spots of their history ----------  bad evil stalin who deported some people considered disloyal during the greatest war in human history, 
   i dont know about nazi germany plans to baltic states at that time send part of non-germanizable baltic people to siberia . 
  your comment is supposed to be sarcastic but they annexed money-sinkhole know as crimea so that 's that . 
  there 's a lot of russians in latvia and estonia too . 
  agreed , racist stalinism ai n't cool too, 
  sweden no ? 
  [ hijacking your comment ] ( https://youtu.be/sezogw_z9w0 ), 
  happy independence from yourself day , brave young country . 
  most interesting imo are these two : amber jewelry making - in lithuania you 'll find shops everywhere that sell genuine [ baltic amber in some form of jewelry , souvenirs , paintings , sculptures and even as art on furniture and wall coverings ] ( http://imgur.com/a/qyhwv ) . 
  of course amber is also a significant part of lithuania 's national costume . 
  also only in lithuania you can enjoy [ amber therapy ] ( http://www.lithuania.travel/en-gb/attractions/amber-therapy/17127 ) . 
  verba making ( ? ), 
  - verbos are bouquets of dried plants used on the palm sunday ( the sunday before easter ) . 
  they represent the palm branches that were laid in christ 's path when he triumphantly entered jerusalem . 
  on the saturday before palm sunday [ lithuanians take special care in choosing and cutting well-formed branches , which the women-folk decorate with with flowers . 
  they flowers are meticulously tide onto the branch . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/l6fli ) the `` verbos '' are blessed during mass and later brought home and dried . 
  the needles were pulled off , and the bare branches are placed behind a holy picture or in the rafters for protection . 
  an old lithuanian custom is to beat each other with the verba branches . 
  even to this day , the saying goes that one must be hit with the verba to remain healthy during the coming year . 
  the father hits his children on their bare legs while they are still sleeping on palm sunday to wake them up for church . 
  when hitting one with the verba you say , `` ne a\u0161 mu\u0161u , verba mu\u0161a '' ( i do not hit you but verba hits you ) . 
  one can ransom himself from the beating by promising the `` beater '' an easter egg ( margutis ) . 
  ----------------------- and then there is all these `` vanilla '' crafts https://kootvela.blogspot.lt/2012/05/traditional-lithuanian-souvenirs.html, 
  le china empire ? 
  thank you for triggering my ptsd, 
   we should built up a line of defence on the eastern border of germany . 
  you should have built up `` a line of defense '' on your borders against illegal migrants ... 
  i 'll have you know that lithuania has agreed to settle refugees from italy and greece , but opposes mandatory migrant quota system . 
  that we 're as corrupt as italy ? 
  `` czech republic '' is the official english long-form name , the official short-form name is `` czechia '' . 
  some of these hit too close to home, 
  as much as kingdom of sweden changed it 's name to sweden, 
   where large portion of them now live below the poverty line and struggle with problems like alcoholism and drug use that 's true for russia too  we are not newcomers , most russians in latvia lived in latvia for longer then latvia existed as an independent state or where born in lativa to those people . 
  not true , russian population increased significantly during the occupation period . 
  more than three times . 
  baltic prussians who lived there , were completely assimilated and old prussian language went extinct . 
  latvians still speak latvian and not a dialect of german . 
  i believe they had free market economies though, 
  lithuanian -- muscovite tsardom would have happened . 
  most likely lithuanians would have been converted to orthodoxy and we 'd write in cyrillic alphabet instead of latin . 
  belarusians and ukrainians would have never formed their own unique identities and languages since they would n't have been isolated from muscovite russians/ruthenians and `` influenced '' by polish . 
  maybe `` communist revolution '' would have never happened . 
  maybe in another country . 
  well , he did n't kill or beat someone . 
  only a self-employed illegal business man / s, 
  ** and you dare to propose restoration of commonwealth to us !, 
  the referendum result is not legally binding , it could end up being an expensive survey . 
  it 's just a shorter name for the country . 
  same as `` germany '' is short for `` federal republic of germany '' , `` russia - russian federation '' , `` sweden - kingdom of sweden '' , `` lithuania - republic of lithuania '' , `` united kingdom - united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland '' . 
  some island country , triangle ukraine , russia 's croatia , coastal serbia , mountain austro-russia , black poland and is that mini ssrs ? 
  [ well ... ] ( https://gfycat.com/acrobaticgiddycormorant ), 
  do n't forget [ 1919 polish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt in lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_polish_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat_attempt_in_lithuania ), 
  soviet and nazi symbols are banned, 
  occupy turkey, 
  can mexico into anglo-saxon ? 
  [ this one is much nicer ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/nordic_cross_proposal_for_lithuanian_flag.svg ), 
  so basically paranoia, 
  do like we did . 
  put all the communist statues , images and other stuff in a museum and sell tickets . 
  yes , i dont know why kaliningrad is the most militarised region in europe and why russia overreacted over maidan in ukraine , that it had to secure it 's military base in crimea . 
  paranoia implies irrational fear, 
  there was never a lithuanian waffen-ss division ;-), 
  is that south finland ? 
  comrade , it does n't change the fact that your elected mp says that . 
  russian tv loves them . 
  russia was n't mentioned in the comment . 
  schizophrenia ? 
   ukraine was and still is considered a close ally to baltic states and has been ever since the brake up of the soviet union that 's news to me . 
  ukraine was viewed as either extension of russia or pro-moscow state until recently , at least here in lithuania . 
  i 'm possibly finnish, 
  apart from the fact that they speak lithuanian with each other , you ca n't . 
  happy independence day, 
  like a eurovision song ? 
  cheeki breeki,
