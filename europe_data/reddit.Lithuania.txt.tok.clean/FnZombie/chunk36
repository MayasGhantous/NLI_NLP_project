  there 's an interactive map on the right side, 
  i expected some form of a counter-argument rather than ad hominem , but that 's just me overestimating randoms, 
  yes, 
  until now i thought it was the same everywhere too, 
  balkan nationalists never dissapoint, 
  [ that 's really impressive that you 're above a small country without important natural resources , rus , but you still have long way to go with so much land and resources ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcsrd0j_bgntmqwne11i0tnk9qwsxn1_nf3isbjdzyvjkevisqonxa ), 
  someone has to make crack releases . 
  denuvo still not cracked . 
  we failed to assimilate others back in sword and shield times, 
  belarus did n't want to be part of lithuania anymore after they learned they can have their own potato monopoly without lithuania . 
  latvia and poland . 
  latvia - same linguistic group , muh baltic bros , no significant conflits ever , has same ~ ~ pagan ~ ~ totally catholic holidays , speaks in a weird way , makes fun of our language . 
  poland - common history with them . 
  we share architecture , food , historical figures , religion and hate for moscow . 
  sometimes displays superiority complex . 
  lithuanians use both '' \u017de\u010dpospolita '' and `` abiej\u0173 taut\u0173 respublika '' ( rzeczpospolita obojga narod\u00f3w ) . 
  we do n't use `` respublika '' to refer to polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  lithuanian term '' \u017de\u010dpospolita '' specifically refers to that state . 
  mine 's too , you 're correct, 
  it 's sob story post about `` hate circlejerk '' . 
   `` vitriolic hate towards us achieves is the same thing coming back at them in return '' hate against who then if not kremlin , vatniks and putin supporters ? 
  russian people ? 
  who hates russian people here anyway ? 
  any examples ? 
  nope . 
  but do the opposite , tell a latvian , he 's basically lithuanian . 
  enjoy ;-), 
  how many did you meet ? 
  a lithuanian who never came into contact with pole might have an unwarranted impression that a pole will be hostile to him in some way . 
  i once met a foreign student who did n't want to tell us where his from for some reason , later we found out that he was from poland . 
  me and my friends were baffled about it , made me pretty sad . 
   but why should they ? 
  they are the successors of soviet union . 
  it 's their moral responsibility , just like germany being the better country took the responsibility to acknowledged it 's crimes and was forgiven by europe . 
   it 's not the same political entity , it 's not the same people ------------------------------  why giving innocent people the burden of what their ancestors did ? 
  -------------  also no one would have known what could have happened without russian protection/occupation . 
  you must be fucking kidding me . 
  we 're not talking about events that happened 200 years ago ... do n't portray it like it happened a century ago ... `` ancestors '' ... are you that uneducated on the mater ? 
  you must be a troll . 
  i wonder how would history of the region be thought in poland if that was the case . 
  `` here in wilno region , the formation of lithuanian state was started , mindaugas united all the lithuanian/baltic tribes/clans , there were 3 capitals ( voruta , kernav\u0117 , trakai ) in this region before wilno city was built by gediminas , the city of wilno has been the capital of lithuania for centuries and all lithuanian rulers resided here , now the city and the region belongs to poland , and that 's why lithuanians do n't talk with us anymore ... '' :d, 
  it could have been a different situation if russia aknowleged illegal occupation of baltic states and the political , cultural and economical damage done to these states during the period . 
   you 're basically polish meh , start saying `` ja pierdol\u0119 '' , `` kurwa '' , `` jeba\u0107 '' , `` pizda '' , `` ni chuja '' in a exaggerated funny manner and then say `` no '' with a stone face . 
   where is lithuania ? 
  idk why would people get mad over this . 
  not everyone cares enough to remember every country/or where a country is in the world . 
  just show them grand duchy of lithuania or \u017de\u010dpospolita on a map , might intrigue them to read more about lithuania . 
   you 're basically russian it should be legal to stab someone who says that, 
  when will russia start to build one with lithuania ? 
  or do you mean one to the crimean peninsula ? 
   in your red-tinted eyes ... after mourning the victims . 
  russia could , you know , like not give us a reason to hate it ? 
  how should the sub look like ? 
  `` you wo n't believe these top 10 things russia did to ukraine !, 
  '' , `` in celebration of crimean annexation , i 'd like to congratulate all the russian users here !, 
  '' , `` eu congratulates russia on banning homosexual propaganda '' , `` baltics say to russia : thank you for all the roads and factories !, 
  '' , `` merkel says : putin is the leader europe needs right now '' . 
   the contingent around here are not representative of the actual everyday europeans and their views and values eurovision had to adopt an anti-booing technology muting all the boos during russian performance ... 
  just a realistic view of russia , no rose-tinted glasses . 
  another eastern germany for poland ? 
  itt people repeating the same leaders . 
  [ baltic sea states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_the_baltic_sea_states ), 
  yep, 
  no , it 's not . 
  partialy true , usage of `` nyderlandai '' is encouraged instead of a more traditional `` olandija '' . 
  hey , semigallian tribe that lived there were once linguisticaly and culturally close to \u017demai\u010diai !, 
  like lithuanian/latvian '' \u016a '' , long `` u '' sound . 
   \u0104 , \u0118 , \u012e , \u0172 have a ` little tail ' ( linguists call it caudata ) . 
  it is used to indicate long vowels which historically once were dipthongs with an ` n ' sound . '', 
  old lithuanian : \u017dansis , modern lithuanian : \u017d\u0105sis ( \u017d\u0101sis ) also : einam mi\u0161k * an * , einam \u012f mi\u0161k * \u0105 * ( mi\u0161k\u0101 ) . 
  `` lets go to the forest '' . 
  [ map ] ( http://geografija.lt/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/pazintinis-zemelapis3.jpg ), 
  i would like to mention that there is `` ba\u017eny\u010dia '' ( church ) - a building used for religious activities and `` ba\u017eny\u010dia '' ( church ) - a religious community . 
  also , there 's a distinction between `` lietuvi\u0173 tauta '' - ethnic lithuanian nation and `` lietuvi\u0173 tauta '' - ethnic lithuanians + every other ethnic group in lithuania . 
  idk why i only learned about it while studying constitution stuff in uni . 
  til my dad is portuguese, 
   it 's been going on for years , long before anyone even dreamt of separating . 
  so you 're saying eurovision is run like russia ? 
  well , he 's english , british empire probably did bigger things in scale . 
   there are locla cultural musical differences and they will influence the votes . 
  folk music does ' t influence the choice of international pop music . 
  neighbours will always vote for neighbours . 
   do you honestly believe that russians overall have the same taste in music as egyptians or japanese ? 
  you 're comparing 3 continents . 
  eurovision is an european song contest + australia and israel . 
   global world means that everyone has access to everything , not that everyone is culturally the same or similar . 
  that 's why everyone watches american tv shows/movies and music pop charts are dominated by artists singing in english . 
   eastern europe is however very similar culturally still . 
  sharing food does n't influence voting in eurovision . 
   russia got points from every nation in the televote , but among the juries they were given 0 points from 20 nations . 
  idk how this is relevant . 
  you said eastern europe votes for eastern european countries because they have similar music taste . 
  yet western europe voted for russia and eastern european countries voted for western countries ? 
  czech republic got no television votes from either . 
  countries just give points to their neighbours , no matter what song + people vote for their favorite song . 
  there is n't such thing as western/eastern/southern / northern european music taste in a global world . 
  latvia gave 12 points to sweden btw . 
  eurovision is a competition , not a concert . 
  we need a different event for everyone to sing in their language . 
  i bet it would n't be popular though .
