  look on the bright side , now romanians can run hollywood, 
   greece because of russia . 
   portugal no idea . 
  wow , had no idea lithuania was so disliked . 
  or is just west hates ex-commie states ? 
  did n't know that , i thought it 's universal, 
  there 's a difference between english and lithuanian sign languages ? 
  nope . 
  we 're uncultured bunch . 
  yeah , declare war against a state with larger army and nuclear weapons ... might makes it right ? 
  these 12 olds from pro-putinstan ... 
   ( kinda ) understand lithuanian probably mutual baltic words ? 
  be wary though : english | lithuanian | latvian : -- | : -- | : -- deer | elnias | briedis moose | briedis | alnis, 
  ju kant meik speling misteiks vaijal toking, 
  no `` batka '' jokes ? 
   banyas , vodka , climate , and suicides fuck ... 
   i 'll never understand why almost all the freaking songs end up being in english because if they did n't , uk , ireland , malta or etc would win every year ... 
  the fact that it 's `` lietuvos respublika '' on one side and it 's just `` latvija '' instead of `` latvijas republika '' really bothers me more than it should . 
  it would be a political suicide . 
  next elections voters would remember the party as `` perversion promoters '' . 
  we have literary a politician who gets elected just because he fights `` the gays '' . 
  major parties do n't care about gay rights and i assume that they would like for things to never change . 
  no , technically lithuanians are charged for the privilege of eating anything . 
  everyone would have belorusian potato jokes like we do , we only have `` zirga galva '' meme about latvians , latvian potato jokes not a thing here . 
  isis would of course not recruit a mentally ill person . 
  that would be immoral for people inovating brutal executions . 
  wow , uk seems closer to turkey and russia , than europe . 
  [ also these fuckers everywhere ] ( https://madamos.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_20120515_175224.jpg ), 
  current one is too, 
  lithuania . 
  to me personally it reminds me of lithuanian summer , specifically smell of grass in the morning , in the countryside . 
  [ why not this ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/flag_of_the_union_state.svg/220px-flag_of_the_union_state.svg.png ) it 's a proposed [ union state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_state ) flag, 
  why would someone want their asshole to be 100 % clean and factory new ? 
  is that person expecting his arse to be kissed ? 
   if russia occupies baltics tomorrow i do n't see that realistically happening any time soon . 
   do you see germany willing to send their sons to your aid ? 
  no , ww2 guilt made everyone a pacifist in germany . 
  i expect help from poland , usa , uk , canada and maybe some from france , spain and portugal . 
  maybe some millitary equipment aid from sweden and norway ... 
  yes . 
  original language + lithuanian subtitles is available pretty much in every cinema . 
   nothing will stop the russians from becoming # 1 well , their economy and china ... 
  in lithuanian : rome is roma . 
  person who lives in rome - romietis / plural - romie\u010diai romanian is rumunas / romanians - rumunai roman is rom\u0117nas / romans - rom\u0117nai rom - romas / roma - romai . 
  generaly called \u010cigonas / \u010cigonai, 
   i mean what would ee say if germany would stop paying its contributions to the eu arguing that they are unpopular and the goverment cant justify them to their electorate ee would probably threaten to reimpose tarifs on german products and close up markets for new goods and services from germany . 
  with justification that they 're protecting their local production and companies that struggle to compete . 
  do n't underestimate ee , maybe it 's a region that is economically behind , but the reason is not because it has stupid leaders . 
  the whole situation could start a shit show of a century ... 
  positive racism ? 
  i ca n't believe it 's the current year, 
  you 're mixing up chechen wars, 
  i think general opinion on this matter is summed up like this : q. 
  do you think welsh , scottish gaelic and irish gaelic should be used more widely ? 
  yes q. 
  are you going to learn it ? 
  or russia would be more powerful , yet still expansionistic . 
  according to russian nationalists ( / r/russia ) , the start of bad relations with the west was nato bombing of serbia . 
  being perceived as military strong is more important to russian voters because of the narrative that is still being fed to them that the west is attacking or expanding nato to attack their homeland . 
  because your country 's pr team is n't making educational videos or commercials around europe about it . 
  there 's no incentive for people to education themselves on this mater . 
  edit : also , are you 100 % sure ? 
  because vilnius is multi-ethnic city and it 's seen as `` port city '' where all foreigners come to . 
  it 's called `` portugalija '' mostly because other lithuanians are just jelly ... 
   why does russia fear the lithuanian special forces ? 
   is that a joke ? 
  i guess it 's this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_tights,

  + sheep = m\u0117 m\u0117 ( meh meh ) ducks = kvak kvak pigs = kriu kriu horses = yhaha ? 
  birds = \u010dik \u010dirik ? 
  snakes = ssssss, 
  our is yellow ? 
  quite fitting , because of piss poor quality of lithuanian football in general . 
   and then people on here wonder why people subconsciously do n't regard any country east of germany as a part of europe . 
  i do n't know if anyone is suprised that bigotry still exists . 
   some gang from lithuania stealing in your country ? 
  lets put eastern european on the headline !, 
  `` highly sophisticated northern european thieves making a fortune in burglaries targeting rural ireland '' just does n't have the same ring to it . 
  lithuania is n't as wealthy as sweden or germany for that to happen . 
  belarus , kazakhstan , moldova and serbia did n't light their monuments ? 
  minority languages in lithuania are protected by national law : * constitution [ lietuvos respublikos konstitucija ] ( 1988 , ratified in 1992 ) art . 
  45 of the constitution emphasizes that national communities of citizens shall be independent in managing affairs related to their culture , education , charity and mutual assistance . 
  this also refers to the use of language . 
  * law on the state language [ valstybin\u0117s kalbos \u012fstatymas ] ( 1995 ) apart from specifying the use of lithuanian in official contexts ( s.a. ) , the law on the state language guarantees ethnic minorities the right to use their own language in education , cultural events and on radio and television . ( art . 
  * law on national ( ethnic ) minorities [ tautini\u0173 ma\u017eum\u0173 \u012fstatymas ] ( 1989 , amended in 1991 ) art . 
  1 states that the national minorities in lithuania have a right to foster their language and are guaranteed that their language shall be respected . 
  according to art . 
  4 the language of a national minority shall be used in local bodies alongside the official language in administrative-territorial units with a concentrated national minority . 
  art . 
  5 states that information signs in such administrative-territorial units can also use the language of the national minority in addition to the lithuanian language . 
  cultural enrichment, 
   it 's basically irrational . 
  ergo emotional . 
  good lord , what have we done ? 
  we all turned into brexiters . 
   coloured people rainbow people ?

  who do you think will fill the void left by eastern europeans in the labour force ... 
  balkans never fail to entertain,
