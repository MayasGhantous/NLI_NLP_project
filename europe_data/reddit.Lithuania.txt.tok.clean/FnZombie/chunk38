  uk is n't western european ? 
  a unique case when the quality of products sold in western europe is signifficantly worse compared to that of the products sold in eastern countries . 
  schengen area member state, 
  it 's not a video game , friend . 
  in the real world countries do n't use their nuclear arsenal for attacking something , especially attacking a teritory near their major cities like st. petersburg and moscow , also kaliningrad oblast and minsk ( belarus ) . 
  [ moomin ] ( https://v1.std3.ru/6a/04/1459173162-6a04c9fb62bfc619d61ffbcce6bb088c.jpeg ) in the streets , tom of finland in the sheets . 
  during the period between the two world wars the name of `` soviet union '' was `` soviet\u0173 s\u0105junga '' in lithuania , but after the soviet occupation it was re-christianized to `` taryb\u0173 s\u0105junga '' to make it more `` lithuanian '' and `` close to home '' . 
  after the re-establishment of the state of lithuania `` soviet union '' is referred to as `` soviet\u0173 s\u0105junga '' again . 
  `` taryba '' is the only word we use for `` council '' . 
  there are no words like `` sovietas '' or `` kaunclas/kauntslas '' in the lithuanian vocabulary . 
  all of it could be avoided if somebody did n't support terrorists there . 
  be prepared to be compared to nazis because it 's a disabled person . 
   i think allowing the singer to perform would make russia look like a troublemaker it does n't look like one already ? 
  artillery strikes and soldiers shooting at each other is hell of a ceasefire . 
  laws are n't enforced selectively ... 
  a country wo n't ignore it 's own laws because of a song contest . 
  [ poland can not into orbital view ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/polish-lithuanian_commonwealth_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/550px-polish-lithuanian_commonwealth_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png ) ? 
  journalists seem to have a low life expectancy . 
  latvians did n't invite nazis over and they did n't have such privilege as to tell them to do anything . 
  rusfed denies occupation . 
  all of the soviet crimes ? 
  so when will russia , as the successor of the ussr , pay reparations to the baltic states for fifty years of illegal occupation , which resulted in mass terror , the destruction of civil liberties , change of the demographic structure in these countries , native population and economic loss ? 
  [ this vitas ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/gjsnymi4z0u ), 
  do you feel closer to turks or spanish because of dubbed turkish soap operas or spanish telenovelas ? 
  it 's serves purely entertainment purpose . 
  the people who watch russian tv shows , watch them because they understand the language since it was the lingua franca of soviet union and , well , they lived in the same country with russians , they can relate . 
  showing dubbed estonian or latvian tv shows would serve entertainment purpose only . 
  however , a show available on both tv and youtube that was both entertaining and educational by showing the differences and similarities between lithuanian and latvian languages and comedy sketches featuring miscommunication situations , while teaching both languages would achieve way more than a dubbed latvian or lithuanian show . 
  even a silly tv show where teams made of lithuanian and latvian contestants would compete by trying to guess the meaning of lithuanian/latvian words ( or something ) or/and get to do silly challenges would be a welcome addition . 
  something like : `` who wants to be a millionaire ? '', 
  meets japanese game shows ( yeah , going out balls deep out of the comfort zone ) . 
  i do n't see estonians being interested in learning any of the baltic languages , imo they would rather learn finnish . 
  and in the future if there was a need for a common country made out of baltic states , i doubt they would like to be part of it since they would be a minority in it . 
  kinda pointless to talk about that while being part of the eu . 
  other than that , a movement with that goal in mind would have my full support . 
  people will not watch tv shows/movies or listen to music that they can not understand . 
  dubbing tv shows or movies in lithuanian would serve no purpose ... adding subtitles ? 
  old folk hate subtitles . 
  giving an option to learn latvian or estonian as a second foreign language instead of german , russian , french or spanish is n't a realistic option either , because it 's not practical . 
  just speak english ? 
  well it wo n't make us feel closer to each other because we literally speak english with anyone in europe . 
  a great example of why we have a problem with the balto-slavic classification . 
  lithuanian is mutually intelligible with any slavic language as much as portuguese , spanish or italian is with english . 
  why russian bases are so close to nato member borders ? 
  a lithuanian, 
  correct , there are more people speaking polish than irish in lithuania . 
  on a serious note , lithuanians are extremely overprotective of the native tongue . 
  once lithuanists ( people who decide how everyone should speak ) killed off lithuanian dialects in favor of standard lithuanian , now they 're trying to revive dialects ... or recently the government sued vilnius city municipality because the mayor put decorative street signs in various languages and writting systems around vilnius . 
  [ pardon their ignorance , they are not aware of the memes . 
  the 1 % in russia are safeguarding the wealth so the west would n't steal it !, 
  it also affects the `` eastern europeans '' who do n't want `` flexible solidarity '' too . 
  let me rephrase it better . 
  after putin is gone , the oligarchs will make sure that the successor will let them continue to do business unopposed and keep the status quo . 
  what is the similarity between the prussian and polish sentences ? 
  lithuanian translation : \u201e sveikas , pone !, 
  [ according to this source ] ( http://www.baltistica.lt/index.php/baltistica/article/view/1079 ) . 
  i was referring to [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/balto-slavic_theories.svg ) . 
  no need for down-votes and picking of articles written in 1967 . 
  please read at least a wiki article ... 
  after putin is gone , oligarchs will just replace him with another putin . 
  if they get tired from standing they can always squat . 
  the relationship between baltic and slavic languages remain in dispute between linguists . 
  i agree , it 's a weird grouping . 
  it 's like `` anglo-romance '' or `` albano-germanic '' . 
   i do n't want to shit on lithuania just for the sake of it . 
  it 's just lithuania is clearly behind the rest of europe in this manner . 
  yeah , but you 're still doing it . 
  you 're very uninformed when it comes to minority rights in lithuania and it shows . 
   every other country has rights for its non-immigratory minorities so does lithuania . 
   so lithuania seems to be the worst part of europe when it comes to minority rights ... 
  this sentence gave it away . 
  any other insults you would like to share ? 
  i 've heard `` lithuania is behind the civilized world when it comes to x '' by polish nationalist before on reddit . 
   in poland there are ethnic groups that have less than a thousand members and still are recognised locally . 
  that 's why it seems so bizzare to have a big minority and ignore it how did you come up with this conclusion ? 
  did you come up with that conclusion after reading one sentence or were you itching to stir up some lithuanian-polish ` friendly ' finger pointing beforehand ? 
  i thought it was a legitimate question . 
  the only official language in lithuania is lithuanian . 
  it 's a sarcastic comment . 
  it 's what kremlin shills write . 
  also \u017demai\u010diai are called a ~ ~ polish ~ ~ anglicized polish name `` zhmuds '' instead of a latin name `` samogitia/samogeti '' . 
  thank you for your meaningful insight . 
  it 's only one of the reasons . 
  here 's all of them : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_poland,

  we have an island ? 
  eastern states seem to lag a bit behind when it comes to adopting western ethics and norms . 
  needs some soundtrack : [ modern ] ( https://youtu.be/sd3cwmbeyck ) [ traditional ] ( https://youtu.be/wn5zy4m6w5q ), 
  * separatism is illegal in rusfed . 
  * it 's a huge military base loyal to the rusfed president . 
  not gon na happen . 
   but one reason why lithuania ( and latvia maybe ) is able to grow faster then estonia is also that its closer to poland and other mainland europe - which is the economical engine of europe . 
  is this politically correct version of saying `` lithuania is able to grow faster because it is closer to the european economical powerhouse - germany '' ? 
  because of religious tolerance and broad privileges there . 
  a lot of jews were expelled or persecuted in western europe so they sought haven eastwards . 
  lol , what a country ... it 's a gift that keeps on giving . 
  when comparing languages the only correct way to do it is to use the [ multilingual `` let it go song '' ] ( https://youtu.be/lpbstwtezom ) . ^ ( i 'm not being serious ), 
  actually , the way russians pronounce it , in lithuanian it would be written like `` v ** \u0117 ** ngrija '' ( [ press the arrow pointing to the right to hear the russian pronunciation ] ( https://forvo.com/word/%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%8f/#ru ) ) rather than `` v ** e ** ngrija '' ( [ press the arrow pointing to the right to hear the lithuanian pronunciation ] ( https://forvo.com/word/vengrija_%5blt.%5d/#lt ) ) .
