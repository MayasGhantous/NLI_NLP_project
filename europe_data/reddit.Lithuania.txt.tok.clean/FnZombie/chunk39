  sorry , but i 'm not following you ? 
  hypothetically , if there was a presidential election tomorrow i would vote for a candidate who i 'd see as the most fit to lead my country . 
  and if the newly elected president made a fool of himself later , i 'd either be disappointed by my poor choice or joke about it with my friends . 
  i would n't feel ashamed by him , because i would n't know him on a personal level . 
  it 's against the law to drink in public , but since he was the president at the time he had immunity . 
  i do n't see how a fellatio would hinder one 's competence as a country 's leader , but committing adultery and lying about it surely makes one a bad person . 
  most people would prefer a person with integrity to lead their country , but such politicians are rare . 
  i feel ashamed of him , i want to feel stronk and the world to be afraid of the eu . 
  / s since i live in a individual , liberal society i do n't mind a politician entertaining me by making a fool of himself . 
  why would i feel personally ashamed by someone 's else behavior ?

   considering what happened in ponary during wwii , i 'm kind of glad vilnius stayed polish . 
  yeah because there were so much massacre in lithuania before the nazi occupation and no massacres in poland during nazi occupation . 
  when vilnius is mentioned love or friendship between lithuanians and poles ends faster than you can say `` wilno nasze '' . 
  you 're suggesting to sit idle while an antagonistic entity actively seeks to undermine european union .

  [ borderlands 2 was locked to russian language for the baltics at first ] ( https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/09/19/russian-borderlands-2-region-locked-affects-cis/ ) , but after an uproar [ 2k changed that ] ( http://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/201336023-about-the-russian-cis-and-baltic-states-version-of-borderlands-2-updated-9-19-12 - ) . 
   btw the first one you linked should mean you get russian prices for that game or at least buy a russian key and activate it normally . 
  it 's a [ screencap from borderlands 2 page ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/3610827d623a44ba82e81de8f1852fbb.png ) . 
  nope , lithuanians have to pay the same price as everyone else in the eu . 
  according to [ steamdb ] ( https://steamdb.info/app/49520/ ) , eurozone countries pay 29,99 $ ( $ 32.42 ) and russians pay 999\u0440 . 
  i believe only baltics are sometimes restricted to `` soviet union '' region . 
  from a personal experience , the price is the same though as for any eu country . 
  according to steam , we 're rich enough to pay eu prices , but not good enough to be in the same region . 
  the cherry on top is when the game is locked to russian language only . 
  does this mean the end of [ this nonsense ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/d5c5c507bf424b21f77a4ffd60957253.png ) , or when a game is available in every european country [ except the baltic states ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/3d705002eb92d813fa37c60d7ff3c8e2.png ) , or locking baltics to the russian version and restricting it to russian language only ? 
  so what do you mean by `` dominate '' ? 
  russia can overpower our countries alone in military might , but poland and baltic states are part of the same military alliance - nato and finland is in the eu . 
  i though you had economy and energy in mind . 
  it was n't strong enough to stop us from joining eu and nato and later diversifying our energy supplies away from them . 
  russia is our biggest trade partner , but their sanctions forced our business to find new partners to do business with . 
  as regional power russia can boss around eastern countries which still rely on it , but not the ones that sought to join the west . 
  everyone has terrible pop music . 
  we just have unironically the worst . 
  she would n't like me either because she 's from kaunas and i 'm from the `` polish city of vilnius '' and therefore automatically less lithuanian than she is . 
  there 's this ridiculous rivalry between the current capital city and the former capital city . 
  one boasts about being `` a multicultural and open city '' and the other boasts about being `` true and authentic lithuanian '' city . 
  `` hate '' is strong word that non native speakers use very liberally . 
  lithuanians do n't hate poles , only biased ones do . 
  this brigade only serves a symbolic purpose . 
  baltic states do cooperate on defense . 
  from wiki :  lithuania also cooperates with the two other baltic states -- latvia and estonia in several trilateral baltic defence co-operation initiatives :  baltic battalion ( baltbat ) -- infantry battalion for participation in international peace support operations , headquartered near riga , latvia ;  baltic naval squadron ( baltron ) -- naval force with mine countermeasures capabilities , headquartered near tallinn , estonia ;  baltic air surveillance network ( baltnet ) -- air surveillance information system , headquartered near kaunas , lithuania ;  joint military educational institutions : baltic defence college ( baltdefcol ) in tartu , estonia , baltic diving training centre in liep\u0101ja , latvia and baltic naval communications training centre in tallinn , estonia . 
   in january 2011 , the baltic states were invited to join nordefco , the defence framework of the nordic countries . 
  in november 2012 , the three countries agreed to create a joint military staff in 2013 . 
  future co-operation will include sharing of national infrastructures for training purposes and specialization of training areas ( balttrain ) and collective formation of battalion-sized contingents for use in the nato rapid-response force .
