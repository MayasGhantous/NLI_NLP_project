  slovenia , probably ljubljana or maribor , so i could live with a very special girl . 
  for one , you do n't assassinate your opposition, 
  [ panglish might evolve from english ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1582954/english-will-turn-into-panglish-in-100-years.html ) . 
  at least in europe , since you can already see people using different words from other languages while speaking english ( for example : cyka , baguette , le , merde , kurwa , blt , anschluss and etc ) . 
  similar language developments have already happaned like [ spanglish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanglish ) , [ llanito ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/llanito ) , [ russenorsk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russenorsk ) ... 
  there was literally less than one hour old account flood writing pro-putin comments today and yesterday . 
  but people poop in there :(, 
  lida , polish , danube , siberian , belmont , polock , s. bator , liubart street ... and many other . 
  basically you could find something ( street name , place name , village name ... ) related to your european country in lithuania . 
  do they have electricity there ? 
  34min account ? 
  pls change your flair to your real tricolor . 
  some could argue that eu is already a confederation/semi-confederation . 
   if i was greek or latvian i would rather live under a new soviet union than the merkelreich there 's so much wrong with this statement that i wo n't even bother, 
  what about use without serbia and other countries not wishing to join it ? 
  as in europe conquering and colonizing weaker states again ? 
  copied it from top youtube [ comment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeim6l5meqi&amp;google_comment_id=z12eh3kj1wy0ildsu22itzkghmezvxmom04 ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suwa\u0142ki_agreement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017beligowski%27s_mutiny, 
  poland is never referred to as `` baltic state '' , but it is a `` baltic sea state '' . 
  not as bad as belarus . 
  only 11.9 % of belarusians speak belarusian at home . 
  our swear words are either `` too soft '' and inoffensive or too hilarious to be taken as serious insults . 
  bad move , eesti . 
  now you 're forever aestii/aistians/ais \u010diai ( also known as baltic ) . 
  never into nordic ( codanonia ) . 
  obligatory friendly translation from latvian into lithuanian because pan-baltism . 
  me too ( common people ca n't be blamed ) but on the other hand i am lithuanian and these news are bad for russia , so ... 
   they 're not coming out of the stone age , you know ? 
  but they do stone people though, 
  nice . 
  east and west are engaged in a quid pro quo agreement where eastern europe opens up their markets to western businesses and west supplies the east with structural funds to make up for their lack of competitiveness , further enlargement of their middle class and masive loss of working age people and brain drain . 
  please tell me what will be the benefits of taking syrian refugees ( or should i say `` germany 's guests '' ? 
  since they were invited by merkel ) who btw will be illiterate since they wo n't know native languages of their host country 's ? 
  i find it ludicrous to impose the quotas while there exists such unequal living standards within eu . 
  is germany going to pay for them ? 
  i also want to ask you , where is germany 's european solidarity regarding nord stream deal with russia which will make it possible for russia to blackmail half of continent ? 
  germany regarding ( now canceled ) south stream was `` do n't do it , what about european solidarity ?! '' . 
  how should we understand this `` european unity '' ? 
  that 's the thing we have as long as we 're doing exactly what germany tells to ? 
  you can still fly by plane, 
  that will show them !, 
  but mean xenophobic lithuanians in 1919 banned polish language , how come they forgot to translate polish surnames ? 
  it 's mind boggling how some polish redditors upvote a polish chauvinist who either spews anti-lithuanian/belarusian/ukrainian rhetoric or `` portrays '' what a eternal victim he and his compatriots are . 
  of course he 's a troll that is reading this right now and holding his sides from laughter . 
  i 'm not talking about you btw . 
  it 's not `` lithuanized '' . 
  by ama_deo 's logic , slavs took lithuanian endings to their surname . 
  how is it xenophobic ? 
  your colleague said it was a polish surname . 
  it 's nr . 
  1 most popular last name in lithuania . 
  explain . 
  make a transit corridor from syria to germany ignoring every countries sovereignty and ignoring law in general . 
  once locals will be overwhelmed by war refugees , all the racists wo n't be able to do anything about it . 
  polish is master-slav and all other slavs got polish word `` koza '' from poland . 
  got it . 
   you wo n't see such names in croatian or russian . 
  oh , but they must be immigrants from poland !, 
  croatia :  `` the surname kozlovi\u0107 is common in croatia . 
  today in croatia , there are between two hundred and three hundred people called kozlovi\u0107 . 
  many of them are living in the following places : umag - 15 % , buje - 11 % , setu\u0161 ( martinska ves ) - 8 % , zagreb - 6 % , velika kopanica - 5 % . 
  taking into account the population density , most people who have the surname kozlovi\u0107 are living in : juricani ( umag ) - 1 . most common family name in the place , setu\u0161 ( martinska ves ) - 2 . most common family name in the place , buje - 5 . most common family name in the place . 
  just stop , not everything slavic in the world is automatically derived from polish . 
  not everything in lithuania is from poland . 
  get off your high horse . 
   because it delievers from koz\u0142owski source ? 
  because as far as i know koz\u0142owski -  kozlovskis ( latvian politician [ rihards kozlovskis ] ( https://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/rihards_kozlovskis ) . 
  root of the word never changes in baltic languages when they 're `` balticized '' . 
  '' \u041a\u0430\u0437\u043b\u043e\u045e\u0441\u043a\u0456 '' ( kazlouski ) on the other hand seems more closer to kazlauskas/kazlauskis ( yes the other one exists too ) phonetically . 
  are all polish surnames . 
  it 's not unique to poland . 
  according to the map a surname like this is popular in belarus , russia , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , croatia and in other countries . 
  and the word for `` goat '' in slavic languages is : belarusian '' \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0451\u043b ( kaziol ) '' , russian '' \u043a\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043b '' ( kozel ) , ukrainian '' \u043a\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043b ( kozel ) '' , czech `` koza '' , slovakian `` koza '' , polish `` koza '' , slovenian `` koza '' , croatian `` koza '' , serbian '' \u043a\u043e\u0437\u0430 ( koza ) '' , bulgarian '' \u043a\u043e\u0437\u0430 ( koza ) '' , macedonian '' \u043a\u043e\u0437\u0430 ( koza ) '' ... 
  so what makes kazlauskas polish ? 
  as far i can see it 's closer to belorusian '' \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0451\u043b ( kaziol ) '' than to polish `` kaza/koziol '' . 
  what makes `` kavaliauskas '' polish , when `` smith '' is `` kowal '' in polish and in belorusian it 's '' \u043a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c ( kaval ) '' ? 
  lithuanians and belorusians used to live in one country for very long time and that country used to used old church slavonic in it 's chancellery . 
  even in our baltic brother latvian 's language `` goat '' is `` kaza '' , so maybe it 's a balto-slavic word in origin ? 
   after lithuanian independence in 1919 lithuanians started to ban polish language and artificially renamed all surnames , street names etc. 
  got source on ban of polish language or renaming surnames ? 
  slavs wanted to be balts confirmed, 
  it 's either that or it 's the same situation like `` kazlauskas '' - a name getting lost in translation ( from `` o\u017eelis '' to `` kazlas '' , from `` o\u017eelaitis '' to `` kazlauskas '' ; lithuanian `` o\u017eys '' - belarusian `` kaziol '' , ukrainian `` kozel '' , polish `` koza '' , meaning `` goat '' ) . 
  that 's gdl 's and \u017de\u010dpospolita 's legacy for you . 
  that 's my speculation since i could n't find no mention of `` kalvinauskas '' name on google ( since `` kalvis '' means `` smith '' ) . 
  higly xenophobic laws in the * eu * . 
  ha ha ha, 
   imo things wo n't improve much in next decades because pilsudski is enshrined as national hero and people do n't want to acknowledge that this `` hero '' image has problems ( like war with lithuania ) i do n't know , pilsudski 's hero status in poland does n't anger lithuanians , the reaction is usually a mild annoyance . 
  [ his heart is buried in lithuania btw . 
  revanchism ? 
  waldemar tomaszewski and the myth of polish minority getting discriminated ? 
  lack of any significant news regarding lithuania ? 
  so , you 're talking about which countries exactly ? 
  you sound a like typical homophobe . 
  everyone knows that russia is a gay friendly country without any anti-gay laws . 
  everything else is western lies !, 
  what about lithuania ? 
  and will it end with germany losing more territory ? 
  it 's more like half of a continent is so last century, 
  where 's germany 's solidarity regarding nord stream , you two-faced country ? 
  accept germany 's rule or else .
