   travellin through poland are endless plains ... and ads . 
  ads everywhere . 
  the other option is a coat of arms extremely similar to ours , minus yellow and blue . 
  they need to change their leader and government first . 
  the country is very `` soviet '' and undemocratic . 
   also lithuanians are slavic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages you 're contradicting yourself . 
  your link shows that baltic languages are a separate language group from the slavic language group in the balto-slavic branch . 
  lame trolling attempt . 
  they are , but you posted in the wrong thread lol, 
  * hundreds of years being neighbors with germany , germans assimilating baltic prussians and baltic germans living in latvia and estonia yet not a slight genetic connection ? 
  * no connection between lithuania and poland either , yet belorussians are related to swedes ? 
  pretty amateurish . 
  so a latvian could buy nauda from suomija and gain so much nauda while shopping in lithuania , because the more nauda latvian fella earns from his farm business = the more potatoes he can buy . 
  i love how in latvian `` nauda '' means `` money '' and in lithuanian it means `` benefit '' . 
  it does in lithuanian too, 
  unlikely , not with that fortress mentality . 
  hardship is nothing new to them . 
  the problem with v4 is that member-countries pursue their our own policies and rarely agree on a common position . 
  in the past it was a very lively format until the member-states joined the eu . 
  the refugee crisis gave some relevance to the format , but as you can see it faded to obscurity again . 
  people from maribor call people from ljubljana - `` frogs '' , because they say `` kva ? '', 
  ( what ? ) . 
  green is the national color . 
  foreigners mix slovenia with slovakia all the time . 
  italian tourists in slovenia are very loud and therefore annoying . 
  also why you took their town ? 
  slovenes say `` ja '' for `` yes '' , although as i understood it should be `` da '' . 
  slovenian language has a lot dialects . 
  some native people ca n't understand each other if they speak in their dialects . 
  very archaic/conservative language in general . 
  hates being called balkan , southern country or teased as `` slavic austrians '' ( do n't do it ) . 
  western croatia likes them , eastern crotia hates them . 
  something about coast dispute . 
  are proud of their horse breed , austrians try to claim it as their own apparently . 
  geographical location, 
  braliukas is into [ nazi vampire anime girls ] ( http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/238/526303-carmilla.jpg ) ? 
  i can confirm , that looks like a forest indeed . 
   such a fence will not stop tanks or other military equipment , but it will make illegal crossings harder, 
  and the lithuanian jewish community and israel is okey with all of this ? 
   and doesnt matter that this article was made in 2015 it 's actually against the subs rules to post articles older than 3 months . 
  * it 's an article from 2015 july 26 . 
  * yitzhak arad is a criminal . 
  * if he was innocent he would n't be afraid to go on a trial and would n't order these smear campaigns . 
  * israel has an excellent relationship with `` history eraser '' lithuania . 
  logic ? 
  that tribal mentality . 
  they throw tanks like hand grenades . 
  it 's a routine practice of referring to us like that . 
  maybe if we make fun of it , it will die off eventually . 
  for the first 20 years we did n't care or bit our lip , but now after another 6 years it reached such level of ridiculousness that it ca n't be ignored anymore . 
   in the coming weeks the panzergrenadier 122 battalion soldiers would be deployed to the former soviet republic lithunia to deter russia from military actions . 
  we welcome troops from germny , which was unified under bismarck in 1871 from a variety of smaller states and principalities . 
  for latvia it 's `` latex '', 
  yes , you 're already part of [ council of the baltic sea states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_the_baltic_sea_states ) , which was supposed to be a spiritual successor to hansa . 
  the first modern constitution in a european country too . 
  mmm , okey ? 
  sorry , but that 's such a simple view and an exaggeration . 
  it implies that the older people are n't the most eurosceptic group of people , who remember the `` good old soviet '' days . 
  economy , infrastructure and foreign investments are growing . 
  what not to like about the eu when it benefits us so much ? 
  it takes one look over the shoulder at the situation in the neighborhood and all the skepticism disappears . 
  how about that hanseatic league ? 
  it 's not a soviet monument and the church was built in 1996 . 
  i get a [ `` homosexual hitler '' ] ( http://www.pipedija.com/images/thumb/a/a9/hitleris_pedikas.jpg/400px-hitleris_pedikas.jpg ) as the first result . 
   instead of crappy salary and the wide spread corruption you all of the sudden live in a nice democratic environment with decent monthly wage but will the world fear them ? 
  it 's not a right though . 
  it takes one member-country to block x country 's ascension process talks . 
  nevertheless it 's a beautiful mural, 
  oh , they redrew it , [ originally it was trump and putin kissing with saliva ] ( https://img.lrytas.lt/show_foto/?f=4&amp;s=19&amp;id=2108170 ) dripping , but it was [ vandalized ] ( http://s2.15min.lt/static/cache/odgwedu4mcwyndb4mtq0ldyyntgwmsxvcmlnaw5hbcwsmjk5mzm5mdc0mq==/uzpaisytas-piesinys-vilniuje-57ad8def34c46.jpg ) later . 
   looks like he has shown worst parts of the city it was n't his intention to promote the city . 
  boris cherry-picked the `` gopnik '' parts because his channel 's theme is gopnik subculture parody . 
  you need to read the article you posted . 
  they 're not getting paid for this and they do n't post disinformation on russian websites . 
  if you think that calling out bullshit by posting facts is the same as russian users `` vytautas '' , `` erikas '' or `` albinas '' posting badly translated anti-american , eurosceptic and anti-nato comments in lithuanian news sites , then my friend , you are very wrong . 
  the so called `` elves '' are transparent about what they do and do n't pretend to be `` vasilij '' , `` artur '' or `` artyom '' . 
  \\* elves vs trolls, 
  huh ? 
  e-estonia is n't new . 
  it was completely random as far as i know . 
  libya is n't in europe . 
  and that another design was worn by phoebe in the tv series friends https://youtu.be/2dayseozj_u, 
  polish nationalism, 
  [ these ones ] ( http://imgur.com/a/oce9r ) were actual proposals in like 2010 ( i think ) . 
  he 's lying , yellow symbolizes shekels and green symbolizes weed . 
  it was pointed out in other comments . 
  multiple reasons : * because interwar lithuania was not a monarchy , but a republic . 
  * the flag colors are national colors and come from lithuanian folk clothes . 
  * interwar lithuania was established as the national state of lithuanians , rather than multiethnic state like grand duchy of lithuania was . 
  * vytis flag had too much red color which was heavily associated with communism at the time . 
  * vytis was too detailed and complicated to be the country 's flag . 
  nowadays the tricolor flag bears a great deal of national pride and symbolism . 
  you 're free to criticize it , especially for using a non heraldic color - green ( our heraldic colors are red , yellow , white and blue ) , but not to be so blatantly rude . 
  yes , we live in a world where diplomats post memes on twitter , pepe is regarded as [ a hate symbol ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37493165 ) and americans elected a walking meme as their president . 
  and that 's not even sarcasm . 
  op 's article posted on 2017 january 8 15:21 , larisa borisovna serguhina 's wiki page created on [ 2017 january 9 5:03 ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%d0%a1%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b3%d1%83%d1%85%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b0,_%d0%9b%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%81%d0%b0_%d0%91%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%81%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b0&amp;action=history ) . 
  interesting coincidence . 
  at the time when our flag was chosen the only country to have the same color combination was ethiopia . 
  then the african nations got their independence and copied the flag colors of the only african country to defeat a european colonial power and retain its sovereignty . 
  [ in 2010 myanmar joined our yellow , green , red flag club ] ( http://370.lt/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/flag_upgrade1.jpg ) .
