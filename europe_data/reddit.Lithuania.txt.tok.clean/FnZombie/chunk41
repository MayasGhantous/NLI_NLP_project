  baroque is style of architecture originating in italy in the early 17th century . 
  also the italian word for baroque is `` barocco '' . 
  is it me or the treeline is altered to be darker ? 
  read it as `` explosive plane to minsk '' . 
  kaunas calls vilnius `` portugal '' because of architecture . 
  sure . 
  most beautiful women , i guess ? 
  portugal is seen as distant land from a lithuanian perspective and at the borderland of continental western/southern europe like vilnius being borderland of lithuania . 
  i do n't think the people who came up with this circlejerk put a lot of thought into it . 
  vilnius could also been called ireland . 
  it 's not meant to be negative to portuguese people , it 's meant to make fun of people living vilnius not being `` true lithuanians '' like people from kaunas . 
  basically people of vilnius being foreigners . 
  vilnius is called portugal by very jealous people , primarily from kaunas city , because vilnius is seen as full of people of different nationalities and ethnic groups , therefore it is not a very `` lithuanian '' city , but a foreign one ( kaunas prides itself as the most lithuanian city ) . 
  it 's also the city visited by most tourists . 
  in a way it 's a `` port city '' . 
  historically it 's been a home for different ethnicities - poles , litvaks ( lithuanian jews ) , gudai/litvins ( belorussians ) , germans . 
  vilnius prides itself as being open , international , multicultural city . 
   why is there a belarusian flag on the ground . 
  the joke is that poles in lithuania have belorussian roots because it 's a mixed group of people . 
   the music and mustaches are ok but what 's with that dancing ? 
  no idea , just a funny dance i guess . 
  the mustache is a lithuanian stereotype about poles , mustache = szlachta . 
   am i correct that they mostly are making fun of the russofilia of the lithuanian poles ? 
  yes , partially . 
  the whole song is about poles getting vilnius because of the election when the polish party and the russian party won as a coalition . 
  so the guy sings about creation of `` slavic bloc '' and throwing out the long time mayor of vilnius city - a. zuokas ( it rhymes in lithuanian ) and putting someone who can say \\* polish text \\* . 
  then they joke about writing street names in polish only and that polish card beat the election ( it rhymes ) , then they sing about the dispute in the 20th century , later they he sings that if lithuanians cause any trouble to them , then poles will win next election and take the whole government and then lithuanians can say `` goodbye '' . 
  the ending is `` jesus , jesus , in the heart plays polonaise music from all these joy , and in the heart `` vilnius is ours , vilnius ours '' is written in polish '' . 
  finland is a nordic country because of specific circumstances : history , being connected by land to sweden , teaching swedish in school , having implemented the nordic model . 
  it 's been 25 years of cooperation between the nordic and baltic countries . 
  25 years earlier estonia 's , latvia 's and lithuania 's membership in the nordic council was considered , but was rejected on the basis that their membership would undermine the understanding of their norden identity . 
  same thing would be if the baltic states invited any random country to be part of the baltic assembly , the definition of `` baltic states '' would change , it would become pointless and just a general umbrella term . 
  put yourself into a nordic country 's shoes , imagine if belarus wanted to be `` baltic '' and part of the baltic assembly , you 'd remember that there was no belorussians holding hands in the baltic way event and had little to do with the baltic states in recent memory . 
  now going back 25 years back , it was decided that the baltic countries should create their own cooperation format separate from the nordic council . 
  the baltic assembly is a copycat version of the nordic council btw . 
  nordic-baltic 8 was created for the cooperation between the baltic and nordic countries instead , a very effective format and very beneficial one for the baltic states . 
  the nordic countries have been mentoring the baltic states from the very beginning . 
  they were the first countries to accept us when the west rejected us , fearing instability in europe . 
  there is another regional intergovernmental cooperation forum for the whole baltic sea region - the council of the baltic sea states . 
  not a very effective one since russia is russia , poland was/is more concerned with visegrad group and it 's relations with central european countries . 
  the relationship between the nordic countries is even more closer than between lithuania and latvia . 
  they 're like a family of countries who sometimes refers to their respective languages as just `` scandinavian '' language , because of how mutually intelligible they are . 
  except finnish ... finland in the nordic family is like estonia in the baltic family . 
  finnish is n't germanic and estonian is n't baltic . 
  just ask any scandinavian what they think of you . 
  no scandinavian person will consider you nordic or close to it . 
  it 's like an ukrainian would ask you if you consider him `` baltic '' , of course not . 
  baltic states being `` nordic '' is just naive day dreaming . 
  we are not socially , economically or mentally close to those countries . 
  cultural similarities ? 
  we can only talk about very early history ( celebrations , traditions and such ) , what we refer to as `` pagan '' history basically . 
  linguistically , we do n't even have an option to learn scandinavian languages in school . 
  we need to be talking about nordic-baltic region , nordic-baltic countries , not baltic countries being nordic . 
  politically we 're allied with the nordic countries and trying to catch up to them , like petras au\u0161trevi\u010dius said '' [ the nordic countries were an excellent example of ** everything ** ] ( https://youtu.be/2hocv5ltt7m?t=14m39s ) '' for the baltic countries . 
  it really trigger me when people tell me that we 're geographically or culturally `` eastern european '' and that our roommates sometimes exclaim that `` baltics are nordic '' , not understanding what both of these things mean . 
  not nordic benelux ? 
  baltics are n't nordic . 
  geography does n't make one nordic . 
  [ somebody mentioned * wilno * ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/a9j3fkbflyc ), 
  wtf , why ? 
  wow , estonia is more finnish than finland itself . 
  why bring this up ? 
  it always ends with the gates of hell being opened . 
  there were a lot dick moves done by our neighbors , except by latvia and belarus who are special . 
  i 've noticed a similar thing with western media with the title formula [ `` x slams z '' ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/6aed8988c4dec574754c18964d08025b.png ) . 
  while the eastern side loves to use the word '' [ hysteria ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/eb99092f577496001b2b4e08876c2eb2.png ) '' in the title . 
   they do that subconsciously to present themselves as important it 's the foreign media that loves to write the same articles every week about baltic defense and russian threat . 
   `` they 're scared to death of russia , '' gen. raymond t. thomas , the head of the pentagon 's special operations command , who visited here recently , said of the tiny militaries of latvia , lithuania and estonia . 
  jokes on the general officer , i 'm already dead inside . 
  lithuania is sitting in the northern europe ( united nations classification ) , baltic sea region . 
  our regional cooperation is with the nordic countries in the format of [ nordic-baltic 8 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nb8 ) and nordic-baltic 6 ( eu members only ) and we understand ourselves as part of the same region . 
  the high ranking politicians of nordic and baltic countries in [ this video discuss our 25 years of cooperation in detail ] ( https://youtu.be/2hocv5ltt7m ) , i recommend watching at least 23 minutes of the video to understand our relationship with the nordics . 
  eu map is not a geographical map . 
  because politically and geographically we 're not ? 
  [ did i miss the part where our folk clothes look like that or that our folk dances look like that , or that our folk music sounds like that ? ] ( https://youtu.be/oanzliuxhno ) . 
  or that we were orthodox christians ? 
  northern europe = / = nordic . 
  it 's not the same thing . 
  yes , `` norden '' mean `` the north '' , but it 's a historical , geopolitical and socioeconomic term . 
  in a simplified way , it 's a `` fennoscandian broterhood of countries '' . 
  `` northern europe '' - is just a geographical term . 
  trim your moustache , pilsudski . 
  we 're fine without suvalkai , seiniai and augustavas , but thanks for the offer . 
  this one is with extra spice - a serb nationalist . 
  probably shilling for free . 
  it takes even less time for prejudice . 
  what do you know about cultures of estonia , latvia , lithuania and russia ? 
  thank you , papa gorbi . 
  one upvote = one thank you for the roads and factories . 
   huh , could this lead to germany recognizing it now ? 
  and how would russia receive this ? 
  with a champagne bottle . 
  in this case `` not recognizing x '' is a good thing . 
  the recognition of the occupation would mean that it was a legal action . 
  it was n't , it was an aggressive act against our sovereignty . 
  we 'd like to be like finland or germany . 
  they 're doing great for themselves . 
  i do n't know about that , but it 's more practical to write one letter for a sound than two letters .
