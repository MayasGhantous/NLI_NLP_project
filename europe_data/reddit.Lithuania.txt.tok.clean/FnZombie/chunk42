  i 'll take '' \u0161e\u0161ios \u017e\u0105sys su \u0161e\u0161iais \u017e\u0105sy\u010diais '' any day over `` szeszios rz\u0105sys su szesziais rz\u0105sycziais '' . 
  latvians resented baltic germans who were a privileged social class in latvia though . 
  this distinctive ethnic group was resettled and replaced by russian newcomers after ww2 . 
  firstly , apart from estonia and finland every other country you listed is in russia 's pocket . 
  secondly ,  `` vladimir putin congratulated ilves on estonia 's independence day and wished him happiness and wished well-being for the people of the republic , '' the russian embassy in tallinn wrote in a post on its facebook page on monday . 
  we too get a letter and send one for their independence day and also everytime putin gets elected to congratulate him and \u201e look forward to future cooperation and friendly relations '' . 
  it 's a standard procedure between countries . 
  a russian leader has never visited baltic states since soviet union times , at least not lithuania . 
  yeah i find it weird when the russian president wants to visit a non pro-russian country . 
  because russian presidents do n't celebrate independencies of lost teritories . 
  even the russian ambasador to lithuania does n't participate in our independence day event . 
  there 's nothing to learn if russian leaders do n't respect neighbouring countries who are n't under their boot . 
  easter europe geographically and culturally is russia , belarus , ukraine , moldova and georgia . 
  your compatriots use the cold war era definition for eastern bloc . 
  that definition ignores culture , religion , thousands of years of history , linguistics and geography . 
  it 's outdated since that political alignment does n't exist anymore . 
  unless we 're still in a war ? 
  czech republic has little in common with belarus or moldova compared to austria and germany ( see holy roman empire ) . 
  i had to check if it was n't the onion article . 
  an unprecedented move . 
  [ remember the incident with the dog ? 
  ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/11/12/gettyimages-73058534.jpg ) it was a publicly known fact that merkel had a fear of dogs , so putin naturally brought a dog to one of his first ever meetings with the german chancellor . 
  putin denied that he knew about merkel 's fear of dogs ... 
  but why bring a dog to a meeting between the two country leaders in the first place ? 
  yeah , that is the type of a person europe has to deal with . 
  i think they do from all these `` europe according to x '' maps . 
  true , most people do n't know that they speak slavic languages or that balkans are not actually near caucasus region . 
  hence the title and the article . 
  maidan started with yanukovich refusing to sign association agreement with the eu . 
  loyalty to moscow was more important to the so called `` ukrainian nationalist '' than fixing ukraine 's corruption and integrating ukraine with the rest of europe . 
  but you did n't try my communism ;-( , i have a che guevara t-shirt as my credentials . 
  not taxes that 's for sure . 
  [ what do you think about lithuanian companies who use people of color as actors for advertisement ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/aglolt0slda ), 
  it 's a masculine ending . 
  a feature preserved from proto-indo-european language . 
  proto-germanic language had \u201e - az '' ending , lithuanian has \u201e - as '' , latin \u201e - us '' . 
  the map looks weird without norway and finland . 
  no way !, 
  really ? 
  hey , want some snow for cheap ? 
  we have a surplus .

  our jews are ultra orthodox ? 
  these maps are getting more shite after every submission . 
  there 's a lot of folk-like modern songs , so i 've had to do some googling to make sure there 's no made up folk songs like [ for example this ] ( https://youtu.be/0pdbqbwwoys ) . 
  so here 's some of the modernized versions/interpretations of lithuanian folk songs : [ rebelheart - ant kalno murai ] ( https://youtu.be/ra-hyqxqh24 ) , [ marijonas mikutavi\u010dius version ] ( https://youtu.be/rl7joizfwiu ) and [ a swedish band roxette doing fan service ] ( https://youtu.be/5zv9asiasoi?t=49s ) for fun .

  blue or green, 
  these low effort submissions wo n't stop , wo n't they ? 
  til usa , uk and possibly france is eastern europe . 
  it 's \u201e lithuanian railways '' , specifically directors with russian bussines ties . 
  maybe we 'll participate after rail baltica is finished . 
  it 's not as comfortable to travel between lithuania and poland with trains as one would imagine . 
  not so long ago you had to travel through kalingrad or belarus to go from lithuania to poland and vice versa because of a different railway track gauge used in baltic states ' rail network . 
  rail baltica project will improve the connection between central and northern europe . 
   they 're scared to death of russia no , not really . 
  worried ? 
  yes . 
  who ? 
  art deco and bauhaus architecture has it 's charm . 
   we might have lived like denmark or finland now . 
  maybe we would , maybe we would n't , but 99 % sure we 'd be much closer to denmark 's and finland 's standard of living . 
  what is this ?
