  is there a video online ? 
  samogitia is one of the five ethnic regions of lithuania . 
  pretty weird to call lithuania - `` teutonia '' when only a small part of it was conquered temporarily . 
  thanks , latinobros !,

  to some it is , hence the other ~ 28 % . 
  [ there 's more to that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d9ufwgf.jpg ) [ 2011 ], 
  this particular study is not aimed at that person . 
  knowing one language is nothing to be proud of . 
  i do n't think you do , friend . 
  [ indigenous language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indigenous_language ) , [ native language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_language ) . 
   share of the population stating they know at least one foreign language a study on english proficiency is an entirely different study . 
  ~ ~ basically everybody in ireland speaks a foreign language . ~ ~ it 's the indigenous language that is in danger . 
  no , if an irish persons speaks english from birth then it 's his native language by default . 
  a foreign language is a language not spoken in the native country of the person . 
  [ well , over 70 % of irish ca n't speak a foreign language ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/foreign-languages-2548648-jan2016/ ) . 
  historical circumstances ? 
  everyone knows at least one foreign language . 
  in school you learn lithuanian ( obviously ) , english as a first foreign language and a second foreign language - german , russian or french . 
  in the prison of nations everyone had to learn russian and prior to that people used polish as lingua franca . 
  religion aside , no way estonians and lithuanians have the same word for `` wheel '' - `` ratas '' ? 
  and italy is not in nato and schengen ? 
  why are you comparing apples to oranges ? 
  if there was a civil war in russia we 'd be as flooded with eastern refugees as southern states with people from mena region . 
  there is no `` protection '' from refugees , we 're just geographically `` lucky '' in this case . 
  russia and belarus are functioning states , if there was a civil war there we 'd be just as flooded from east as are southern states from mena region . 
  there is no `` protected '' border and no common eu policy . 
  what op wrote is nonsense . 
   whether we protect them ( like the eastern ones currently are ) how is the eastern border protected by the eu ? 
  so now us will have to hack them in turn ? 
  you 're two years late, 
  thank you , belarus , for keeping the potato jokes alive for another year . 
  the other option would be to start a new life in russia from scratch . 
  so it 's an easy choice . 
  and start a nuclear apocalypse ? 
   crimea was important because it has a port with access to the mediterranean sea , and importantly , not frozen over in winter like the ones in estonia . 
  baltic ports never freeze during winter either , except for sheltered bays and shallow lagoons . 
   even then to get to the atlantic you have to pass inbetween denmark and sweden which means even if you were to get a port there , unless you were willing to invade denmark to maintain safe passage in the eventuality of war with nato it would be useless anyway . 
  and to get to the aegean sea you have to pass bosphorus controled by a nato member * which means even if you were to get a port in * crimea , * unless you were willing to invade * turkey * to maintain safe passage in the eventuality of war with nato it would be useless anyway * . 
  exactly , vladivostok is way past ural mountains . 
  does your definition of europe include all of asia ? 
  [ because vladivostok is not far from north korea ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/vladivostok,+primorskiy+kray,+russia/@42.6704338,130.1716432,6.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x5fb39cba5249d485:0x186704d4dd967e35!8m2!3d43.1198091!4d131.8869243 ) . 
  personally , i 'd go with this one https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:nordic_cross_proposal_for_lithuanian_flag.svg  can we into nordic now ? 
  or is it still too `` rastafarian '' ? 
  already blanda upp, 
  posts only pros ... 
   do you expect me to poke around there looking for this information ? 
  yes , i expect you do exactly that since you wanted the source of these maps . 
  these map are from the special eurobarometer 451 report by european commission . 
  download the pdf file right now and look for them . 
  good luck . 
  oh it 's the fake news guy . 
  [ op comment has the source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ke5v6/how_positively_do_eu_members_see_selected/dbn8t5k/ ) . 
  lithuania likes everyone except mordor, 
  [ we all know that a politician would never lie ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37982000 ) . 
  politicians promise a lot of things electorate wants to hear during elections , but once elected they seem to forget about their promises . 
  talks do n't matter , actions do . 
  barely any comments , threads being posted hourly and nothing critical being posted ever . 
  hopefully someday yearly earnings of their mods will be leaked on the internet . 
  trump will take office only on january 20 . 
  so this imaginary trump administration is n't `` getting close to russia '' at the moment . 
  care to explain ? 
  and there 's no highlandian , samogitian , suvalkian , dz\u016bkian and memelian !, 
  that reminds me of the fact that albanian language family consists of a single language - albanian . 
  easy to consume joke and amusing to new users who did n't see it for the 100th time yet . 
  the populations of andora and usa do n't participated in direct democracy and do n't vote on matters in the un , representatives of their respective countries do that . 
  every country has the right to recognize or not to recognize a country no mater how small it is , it 's their choice . 
  people of andora do n't have the same voting power as usa , because neither us or people of andora vote in the un . 
  \\* colonized, 
  maybe because of the root word in ziemassv\u0113tku . 
  that would explain the different shade of blue . 
  what you described is n't a problem at all . 
  because everyone was so equal and free under previous system . 
  that 's hardly possible and would be problematic . 
  a lot of countries would n't exist on a map if that was the case because every country has an agenda . 
  lem me put it in other words . 
  you see kosovo as a separate state on maps because more than half of un members recognize it . 
  but fortunately locals themselves managed to do that instead ? 
  kosovo 's independence is recognized by 110 un member states , the accession of crimea into russia is recognized by 11 . 
  why be patient ? 
  we already know who 'll win . 
  is he taking putin with himself too ? 
  i 'm sure lukashenko could find like-minded friends in pis, 
   you do n't even fit in to baltic with that !, 
  remove finno-ugrian spy !, 
  no , we wish there was a sea between us . 
   but . . why compare us to the nazis ? 
  well , the formula goes like this : nazis = evil , if nato = nazis , then nato = evil . 
  nazis sought to exterminate russians and the victory against them is celebrated as the greatest thing ever to happen in their modern history since it was about the survival of their people from total extermination . 
  so take that inspiring event as an example and compare your enemies ( real or perceived ) to nazis and it becomes easy to rally the people against your enemy . 
  i agree , it 's hard not to sleep when there 's no real threat and you 're just there to sit through a presentation . 
  [ these are the faces of military officers being told that 4 thousand troops is a threat to the russian federation ] ( http://imgur.com/a/qtgke ) . 
  they would rather go home than listen to this nonsense . 
  either by someone who was recruited by russian intelligence or the computer network was hacked . 
  needs some explanation what it means for the lazy people . 
  '' ... the higher the score the better cardiac care a country has ... '' and etc. 
  at least lithuanian constitution prohibits having foreign military bases in lithuania 's territory , bad experience with them ... occupation and all that jazz . 
  to circumvent this we have nato troop rotations . 
  different nations send their troops to do military exercises or do air-policing missions and etc. , but they ca n't stay here permanently . 
  i know that but old prussians we 're as distinctive from lithuanians as latvians , with even more conservative baltic language than lithuanian might i add .
