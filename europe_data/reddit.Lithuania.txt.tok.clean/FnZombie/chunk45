  which few countries ? 
  the ones you mentioned - bulgaria and poland . 
  bulgaria and poland are n't the only countries in eastern europe . 
   constitutional bans . 
  lithuania 's constitution was approved in 1992 . 
  marriage was defined as a free union between a man and a woman , which was how it was understood back then and it was the norm . 
  since then nothing was changed regarding marriage . 
  it 's only a `` ban '' in a sense that gay marriage is n't recognised in the constitution . 
  estonia recognised same-sex unions this year . 
  lithuania 's parliament is discussing it and probably will do the same as estonians . 
  idk about latvia . 
   homosexuality was only legalized in portugal in 1982 . 
  in lithuania only in 1993  of those who are in eu , with the exception of the baltics , who else were part of urss ? 
  why are you changing the topic ? 
  in what way are the baltics '' * making changes to make that impossible * '' ? 
   portugal and spain also had a 40 years dictatorship . 
  but those countries were not issolated from western europe and the rest of the world . 
   but my point is that you see western europe moving in one direction and eastern europe making changes to make that impossible . 
  bulgaria or poland were n't part of urss , for example . 
  in my personal opinion , you ca n't equate half of a continent with a few countries . 
  no , eastern europe wrote their new constitutions . 
  eastern europe was moving from jailing homosexuals , sending them to psychiatric hospitals and hard labor prisons . 
   i guess blaming all on urss is n't enough . 
  did i miss the part where homosexual marriage was legal in ussr ? 
  and they were n't persecuted by the militsiya ? 
  living in a dictatorship for 50 years where such topics were censored and discrimination was sanctioned by the government leaves an impact on society . 
  once ee countries got their independence they could n't have been beacons of tolerance because the whole european continent was n't tolerant to homosexuals before ww2 . 
  western europe was free to exange ideas and free to talk about anything ( except extremism ) , ideas were n't dictated and censored by an idealogical gang . 
  maybe philosophically or spiritually ? 
  it 's ironic to complain about a whataboutism with a whataboutism , do n't you think ? 
  as long as the native language is second after the official language of interethnic communication . 
  til that [ estonia has p\u00fcssi and finland cloned attila as half man , half ant - antilla ] ( http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/energy/files/multi/2015-05/150513_balticconnector_kart.gif ) . 
  we just use the persons title - teacher , professor . 
   they need to make up their mind . 
  [ we made up our mind ] ( http://imgur.com/a/jnche ) when the nordic countries extended a helping hand in the 90s . 
  the nordic council even [ invited the baltic states to their session while we were still not independent ] ( http://imgur.com/a/tewl0 ) . 
  [ the nordic countries mentored young baltic republics and gave financial help ] ( http://imgur.com/a/hzkhm ) ( [ another example ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ojp50 ) , [ example 2 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/kcbzq ) , [ example 3 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/k3mwl ) ) . 
   northern europe is sweden , norway and occasionally denmark . 
  also iceland . 
  finland is russia . 
  the baltics ? 
  well , who knows . 
  [ your statesmen consider us as northern european region countries ] ( http://imgur.com/a/v3msf ) . 
  lithuania 's , latvia 's and estonia 's [ membership in the nordic council was considered at one point ] ( http://i.imgur.com/upy7he0.jpg ) , but ultimately it was decided to have separate formats : the nordic council and the baltic assembly . 
  if my memory serves correctly norway and sweden were strongly against , finland was neutral , denmark was against , only iceland supported the membership ( btw , it was the first country to recognize our independence too ) . 
  mostly because of baltic states not being of `` scandinavian character '' ( ethnocultural reasons ) . 
  nordic-baltic 8 is format for regional cooperation between nordic and baltic countries , the meetings are being held for 25 years now . 
  there 's a wider format too - council of the baltic sea states . 
  baltic states are not part of any other regional formats . 
  we 're essentially countries who have a crush on you and you pretend not to notice . 
  it 's a big taboo . 
  at least in lithuania nobody talks about homosexuality and nobody cares to educate people . 
  it 's widely seen as a mental disorder and you can face social exclusion from your friends if you think otherwise . 
  politicians are afraid to do anything about it because they 'll lose votes , `` he supports the gays '' is enough of a reason for electorate not to vote for a candidate . 
  if they do n't start talking about it in schools nothing will change . 
  inb4 `` it 's only the older soviet generation '' , younger people are even more homophobic and aggressive . 
  which has nothing to do with the topic . 
  neither poland or slovakia considers itself as eastern european either . 
  if you look at the regional cooperation formats there 's a clear line who is where . 
  [ for lithuania it 's maybe this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tsunhbw.jpg ) . 
  you 're sure about that ? 
  the symbol on the right is a slavic swastika . 
   okay so quick look through our main news sites and nobody writes about this . 
  i 'm sure macedonian teens will sort this out . 
  well even if you had an argument with the taxi driver , he could n't have left because it was his taxicab and you were too drunk to drive . 
  [ are you sure about that ? ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/society/3e23941a-eceb-4b51-a72e-a6ddd68d1c5c ) .

  do we side with germany or [ france ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pvrf1mx.png ) ? 
  op was referring to `` vilnius '' . 
  it 's even pronounced similarly [ villn\u00f6\u00df ] ( http://forvo.com/word/villn%c3%b6%c3%9f/ ) and [ vilnius ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/vilnius.ogg ) , if germans did n't pronounce `` v '' like `` f '' it would be identical . 
  on the other hand , there 's still some hope for ukraine to change . 
  i tried it once , my heart was fine , but i got bronchitis : /, 
  not nordic , but people like that are called `` ruoniai '' ( `` seals '' ) or `` sveikuoliai '' ( `` healthy people '' ) here .

  you 're right , pushing agendas like that is petty . 
  also , you can taste [ op 's salt ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/5fcc21ab83421dff4329872c9b18b978.png ) . 
  it 's not , linguistic purism is institutionalized around the world . 
  substituting loan words with local vocalbury is a normal practice . 
  hell , my native language used to consist of ~ 20 % germanic and slavic loans , now as a result of language preservation and purging policies , germanic and slavic loanwords constitute only 2 % of the standard lithuanian lexicon . 
  and even those words have lithuanian equivalents . 
  loan words change the character of a language , for example romanian is perceived as sounding different from other romance languages because of slavic loans , even though it 's arguably closest to latin . 
  `` firststuffs '' would n't be funny if it was a commonly used word , it 's just bias . 
  i personally would n't want to relearn a language though . 
  you either consume the alcohol or alcohol will consume you . 
   has anyone been to poland and tried any of these traditional dishes ? 
  i do n't even have to leave my home country to eat this . 
  happy independence day , you lucky bastards !, 
  napoleon was a pretty cool guy . 
  see [ duchy of warsaw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_warsaw ) . 
  lithuanians too were hoping for a similar liberation and joined napoleon 's forces . 
  oh , pardon my provincial accusation , you obviously had in mind that meaning of the word and not the other one . 
  godspeed and bless your little heart . 
  nah , [ baltic pride ] ( https://youtu.be/lq1blouxaf8?t=5m41s ) events are held since 2009 . 
  it 's commonly associated with the general medical terminology used to describe erectile dysfunction . 
  [ it 's really that simple ] ( http://i.imgur.com/talo2fk.jpg ), 
  ah the russians and their obsession with anything related to phalluses . 
  time to stop the charade , tovarishch , and embrace your sexuality , just imagine how beautiful the [ kremlin ] ( https://www.askideas.com/media/43/the-front-view-of-the-kremlin-palace-picture.jpg ) would look like surrounded by a colorful parade .
