  we should be thankful for not being genocided ? 
  the balkans man ... 
  there are free ebooks or free chapters on google scholar on the topic of baltic independence and the events in the 90s . 
  you should read them if you think russia let baltics out of the kindness their hearth or that 1991 was the final chapter . 
  there was immense foreign pressure on russia when it still cared about that , baltics could n't get out former ussr army out of their territory until 1995 , there were a lot of provocations , unfounded accusations of discrimination against russians , sponsored anti-independence movements , economical blockades , baltics were referred to as `` near abroad '' - as in not real countries , russia hindered our progress in joining eu and nato . 
  we should be thankful to russia for making our three countries so united too ? 
  or `` letting '' us join nato and eu too maybe ? 
  or maybe not being nuked like one of the parliament members of state duma suggested to show nato not to mess with russia ? 
   so baltics really believe russia will attack them ? 
  welp , you got us , we just love doing military exercises . 
  it was just a prank . 
  time to pack it up , guys , disband the military since russia would n't download the baltics . 
  we do n't have any other threat in the region , unless sweden is secretly plotting something ? 
  we 'd build a great baltic wall if finland was threat . 
  maybe belarus will throw potatoes at us until we die from overeating ? 
   at least crimea has a strategic value and really the people there would like to live in russia . 
  i see this false argument all the time . 
  baltic sea ports that never freeze during winter have the same strategic value as crimea . 
  less nato = more `` secure '' russia . 
  you need to check the number of russian speakers in latvia and estonia , in some regions they constitute the majority . 
  latvia and estonia has their problems with integration and most of russian speaker get their news from official russian government sponsored channels . 
  conveniently those regions are near the russian border . 
  unfortunately , baltics are an easy picking for a country with a way bigger military and annexation of crimea was celebrated in russia . 
   tell me why russia would risk a full scale war with nato because of three little pieces of land ( little for them , no disrespect ) why would nato or eu members risk a nuclear war over three little pieces of land ? 
   the answers i have been given so far are unsatisfying . 
  what do you think about arguments such as nato is expanding into russia 's influence zones and nato is national risk to russia ? 
  unreasonable ? 
  it 's because russia is not germany , uk or france , and it should n't be perceived as such . 
  i 'll just sum it up in a one sentence : * a chauvinistic state is trying regain it 's former glory in any way possible * . 
  it 's the bi-monthly `` news '' : `` yep , baltic soldiers are still doing exercises '' . 
  there wo n't be any talks about further expansion for the foreseeable future because one of the eu 's most important columns is leaving . 
  yep , weird . 
  most girls in lithuania are light-haired . 
  it seems that everyone has brown eyes in the picture . 
  prison of nations, 
  [ those would go well with our sports clothes ] ( http://www.respublika.lt/uploads/img/catalog/1/photo_for_homepage_1_55945797.jpg ) . 
  yep lutheran/protestant churches look different from catholic churches . 
  the color scheme reminded me of a specific church from my childhood . 
  so it 's about things we share . 
  i found it weird at first because we do n't even learn about latvian mythology unless it 's a common element for us too . 
  that 's pretty weird since we have our own rich pantheon of gods and myths . 
  with baltic mythology splitting into lithuanian mythology and latvian mythology . 
  some overlaying baltic and indo-european elements are shared between the two , but independent gods and nation specific folklore exists . 
  i 'm not familiar with slavic mythologies . 
  could you explain how baltic and slavic mythologies are `` the same thing '' ? 
  [ reminds me of a church in a small town in lithuania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/edluppn.jpg ), 
   20 % lithuanian mythology why ? 
  i believe that `` kaka '' seems to be rather universal for all babies . 
  greek '' \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 '' might come from baby-talk . 
  `` czechia '' is the short form for `` czech republic '' , like `` sweden '' is short for `` kingdom of sweden '' or `` germany '' for `` federal republic of germany '' and etc. 
  no , military might is the only thing russia has . 
  economically it 's not a desirable or appealing integration core . 
  natural resources ? 
  total submission to russian hegemony . 
  so unspoken military threats is a way to keep countries from seeking closer integration with the eu . 
  ukraine has been made an example of what could happen if kazakhstan , belarus or others decide to seek integration with the west . 
  the president is just another cogwheel in the political mechanism . 
  he ca n't do anything what the majority of statesmen do n't support . 
  yes , by the geopolitical west/east split cold war definition of it . 
  the one still popular in the western europe and frowned upon by `` eastern europe '' . 
   russia , belarus , ukraine , moldova , serbia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , kosovo , albania , fyrom macedonia that 's a lot of ee countries not in the eu . 
  nordics have a long history of neutrality . 
  if finland , baltics or poland gets occupied sweden will be one of the first countries to recognize it . 
   white slope ( bia\u0142ystok ) we call it `` baltstog\u0117 '' - `` white roof '', 
  if they were nordic they would have been considered as such already . 
  back in the 90s nordic council declined the upgrade of baltics states status of `` observer '' to `` full members '' . 
  baltic assembly was established in the image of nordic council . 
  nordic-baltic 8 regional format was established as a northern european cooperation format . 
  in a way it 's the same as being part of nordic council . 
  nordic countries do not consider estonia as `` nordic '' . 
  it 's the natural order . 
  nature always finds a way to partition poland . 
  the lithuanian word for `` peasant '' - `` valstietis '' does n't have a negative connotation like it does in english . 
  the party was probably not aware of the fact . 
  i love how you made a distinction between the west and eastern europe . 
  spending 2 % of bvp does not make a profesional army . 
  people always forget about [ kaliningrad enclave ] ( http://www.sussexineurope.org/europeinschool/states/kaliningrad/kal_baltic.gif ) . 
  like people who used the narrative of `` ukraine was taken over by nazis '' , wo n't come up with another ridiculous explanation for yet another land grab ? 
  if russia can get away with something it will do it . 
  has everyone forgotten that it 's not the first time russia has invaded someone in modern history ? 
  also , are people so naive and think nuclear weapons will be used over baltic states ? 
  alcohol in seimas restaurant - glass of wine or champagne . 
  bless your heart, 
  no , but there are some countries who impose language quotas . 
  france comes to mind . 
  hijacking your post with [ european version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oxvtdyj.jpg ) . 
  / r/redneckengineering, 
  since the proto-slavic language formed from the peripheral-type baltic dialects : indo-european `` h ^ 1 rug ''  lithuanian `` r\u016bgti '' / latvian `` r\u016bgt ''  serbo-croatian `` r\u0209gati '' `` r\u012bga '' is unrelated, 
  democracy does n't work that way , but dictatorships and authoritarian regimes do . 
  punching x is always a bad thing , regardless of what reason . 
  except for self-defense and kinky stuff obviously . 
  would you like to get punched because someone disagrees with you ? 
  should i hit you over the head because you wrote a moronic comment ? 
  there 's [ multiple geographical centers of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_midpoint_of_europe ) because there are multiple ways to measure a geographical center . 
  central europe is a [ german concept anyway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitteleuropa ) . 
  \\  too far up north to be southern or central \\  too far in the east to be western \\  politics and economic policies : northern \\  socioeconomic issues : eastern seems about right, 
  vilnius was the capital of the lithuanian state ( or the lithuanian governorate in the russian empire ) for at least 600 years . 
  uk , ireland and iceland should better watch out so poland would n't have `` better claims '' on their cities . 
  yes , it makes sense, 
  the origin is unknown .
