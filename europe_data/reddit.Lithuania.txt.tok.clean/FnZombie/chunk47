  could be either because of [ the latvia 's shape ] ( http://zirgam.lv/wp-content/uploads/tdomf/7471/zirgagalvalatvija.jpg ) , [ latvian jumis sign ( baltic pagan god who personified the harvest ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/jumis.jpg/1200px-jumis.jpg ) or just because `` zirga galva '' ( `` horse head '' ) is a funny phrase to lithuanians ( lithuanian '' \u017dirgo galva '' ) . 
  the act of february 16 , 1918 proclaimed the re-establishment of the lithuanian state , making it the successor to the lithuanian historical state , the grand duchy of lithuania . 
  our modern constitution does n't mention neither the grand duchy of lithuania or the polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  technically you were those pesky white and black cross bearers when plc did it . 
  poland considers itself as the successor to the rzeczpospolita as stated in their constitution . 
  of course culture , religion , history or geopolitics do n't matter . 
  for example , what does [ lithuania ] ( https://youtu.be/d6qcbu0qrby ) have in common with [ latvia ] ( https://youtu.be/o9gucr1xmve ) , [ germany ] ( https://youtu.be/-3yjfkgjg1y ) , [ poland ] ( https://youtu.be/-5deujpgqsa ) or [ czechia ] ( https://youtu.be/iizwluelk8e ) ? 
  or on a lesser degree with [ sweden ] ( https://youtu.be/mfbwy4a7tys ) , [ denmark ] ( https://youtu.be/ch_lweeroqq ) or [ norway ] ( https://youtu.be/vffrpvtw3pi ) ? 
  seems like nothing , lithuania is quite obviously closer to [ serbia ] ( https://youtu.be/gqyliwnupeg ) , [ montenegro ] ( https://youtu.be/hanhpgmsal0 ) and [ greece ] ( https://youtu.be/0dy13sulftw ) . 
  or with [ belarus ] ( https://youtu.be/vceh8z5wo-s ) , [ ukraine ] ( https://youtu.be/jliiedpwzew ) and [ russia ] ( https://youtu.be/niy0gzpqqsi ) ? 
  i agree with you that european countries should be placed in geographical groups based on demographic and economic statistics , maybe one year lithuania can be southern european and on a good year western european . 
  oh well , we do n't have a scapegoat group to blame , what you gon na do \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  man , i should have flaired my [ other submission ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/5owoct/venetian_flag_of_republic_of_lithuania/ ) as `` redesign '' instead of `` original content '' , it has more upvotes . 
  nope , i made it in belorussian style for fun . 
  also the [ belarus flag in the style of slovakia ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/4x29xj/belarus_in_the_style_of_slovakia/ ) . 
  i think op mixed up slovenia 's and lithuania 's question .

  can you stop with the `` one million ukrainians in poland '' meme ?

  `` brolis '' means brother in lithuanian , latvians are seen as the closest nation to us , like a sibling .

  lithuanian surname `` rakauskas '' could potentially mean `` austrian '' ? 
  do czechs have a surname like that ? 
   while it 's definitely not helping , it 's not like russians in lithuania would be much more loyal . 
  why else have you had to block russian propaganda from them ? 
  kremlin propaganda was n't blocked so it could n't reach russian speakers specifically . 
  the situation in lithuania and estonia is hardly comparable , because there is n't mistrust between lithuanians and russians in lithuania . 
   citizenship does not grant loyalty , and the non-citizens issue is not the root of the problems . 
  it 's hard to feel loyalty to a country that does n't see you as it 's citizen and it would like you to leave because you are primarily perceived as a consequence or a reminder of a historical injustice . 
  the sea is finland, 
   is your government trying to do something to enable them so that they do n't become hostile to estonia ? 
  relations between estonia 's government and its russian minority have long been strained . 
  back in the 90s , russian speakers who came to or were born in estonia after the soviet takeover were denied automatic acquisition of estonian citizenship . 
  this caused mass statelessness of non-estonians , which harmed relations between different ethnic communities inside estonia and evoked criticism from international organisations such as the united nations , the organisation for security and co-operation in europe , the council of europe and the european union . 
  some russians , who live in estonia believe that they are discriminated . 
  poland where ? 
  i see rzeczpospolita/republic of both nations though . 
  it 's not possible for the baltic states to match the amount of tanks or military equipment rufed has and our countries are located on a flat area . 
  the only option is guerrilla warfare against an invader so an investment into anti-tank weaponry makes more sense . 
  what the baltics have to do with this ? 
  i see a nordic flair , do n't you ? 
  nothing , it 's a different sound ( ** j ** emenas - ** y ** emen ) . 
  there 's less confusion with d\u017e ( ** j ** ohn ( d\u017eon ) ) and \u017e ( ** j ** acques ( \u017dak ) ), 
  no , you did n't . 
  someone could make a polandball comic out of this, 
   dacia `` the company was founded in 1966 , and has been a subsidiary of the french car manufacturer renault since 1999 . '', 
   skoda `` after 1991 it was gradually privatized and in 2000 \u0160koda became a wholly owned subsidiary of the volkswagen group . '', 
   skype `` skype was founded in 2003 by niklas zennstr\u00f6m , from sweden , and janus friis , from denmark . 
  the skype software was created by estonians ahti heinla , priit kasesalu , and jaan tallinn . '',

  lithuania is so random . 
  the background should either be red or green ( the national color ) . 
  also a swastika ? 
  why not incorporate a national symbol like the jagiellonian cross or columns of gediminas ?

  dual citizenship in lithuania is granted exceptionally . 
  for example , you can aquare lithuanian citizenship if one of your family members fled during the soviet occupations and have dual citizenship that way , but if you aquare the citizenship of a foreign country while having a lithuanian citizenship , you automatically lose your lithuanian citizenship . 
  so what is so funny to assume that a neighboring country has a similar corruption level ? 
  is laughter a normal reaction to when estonia is compared with latvia ? 
   so , no need to be smug that would be very un-eesti . 
   perhaps from their historical connection with poland in the polish-lithuanian commonwealth ? 
  ^ this , lithuanians were seen as having too much `` slav blood '' and there were a few conflicts between germany and lithuania , which i mentioned in my other comment . 
   source ? 
  wikipedia says 13 % of lithuania 's population died in the war . 
  are you suggesting that another ~ 30 % died in 1945-1953 ? 
  no , lost population = / = killed population . 
  add mass deportations , partisans killed and political prisoners sent to gulags and it adds up . 
   not just the jews , the lithuanians too . 
  germany planned to exterminate and deport ~ 85 % of lithuania 's population as part of generalplan ost i 'm very well aware . 
  the nazis had plans for deportation of local people from the baltic states to siberia . 
  we know the death toll in siberia when the soviets actually did it and let 's not have illusions that the nazis would have provided housing and a comfortable trip by train . 
  nazis planned to remove 50 % of latvians and estonians and 85 % of lithuanians , the rest were seen as good crop for germanisation . 
  the percentage for lithuanians was so high because of 1 . 
  memel dispute 2 . refusing to participate in invading poland together ( germans promised wilno to lithuania ) or providing passage ( lithuania was neutral ) , 3 . 
  it seems himmler really hated lithuanians . 
  also germans failed to conscript lithuanian into those ss divisions . 
  one the footnotes states :  a 1942 wehrmacht document suggested that the nazi leadership considered implementing a special policy for the eastern front through which the estimated * 750,000 babies born through sexual contact between german soldiers and russian women ( an estimate deemed very conservative ) * , could be identified and claimed to be racially german . 
  ( it was suggested that the middle names friedrich or luise be added to the birth certificates of male and female babies . ), 
  although the plan was not implemented , such documents suggest that the births that resulted from rapes and other forms of sexual contact were deemed beneficial , increasing the `` aryan '' race rather than as adding to the inferior slavic race . 
  the underlying ideology suggests that german rape and other forms of sexual contact may need to be seen as conforming to a larger military strategy of racial and territorial dominance .
