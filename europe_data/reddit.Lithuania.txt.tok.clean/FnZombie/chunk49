  lithuanian economics . 
  i forgot to mention in the original comment that all the shops in our malls have eternal discounts too . 
  schr\u00f6dinger 's ~ ~ cat ~ ~ discount . 
  you could compare polish prices and lithuanian prices and it will be the same . 
  after lithuania joined the euro zone consumers started to spend more money buying products , but the prices increased as well . 
  somehow the [ demand & supply curve ] ( http://www.robertson.ms/demandsupplycurve.jpg ) in lithuania works more like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nxaeup8.png ) . 
  you save money driving from vilnius to poland and back to purchase products from poland than buying them in lithuania ... 
  it 's amazing how business is free to do whatever and our imbecile government is more concerned with raising the drinking age to 25 and banning all alcohol in festivals which will result in event organizers moving all the future events to latvia . 
  while estonians are enjoying growing wages , we 're living in economical anarchy . 
  it should n't surprise anyone that people are running away from the asylum . 
  reduce sodium intake , trigglypuff . 
  this meme wo n't catch on but you can keep on trying , sunshine . 
  did n't everyone living in the village have those back then ? 
  my lithuanian compatriots , it seems that we need to try harder to get rid of the winter during [ u\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s ] ( https://youtu.be/790vhn6js3k ) because it 's getting ridiculous . 
  everyone around poland was an agressor : czech republic , lithuania , belarus , ukraine . 
  poland did nothing wrong . 
  at least that 's what is thought in schools . 
  those radical nationalists hated the vilnius that was returned , it was turned into a provincial city by poland . 
  i know about these maps , but they are n't geographical maps . 
  not politically or geographically, 
  finland , greece , lithuania , ukraine are central europe ? 
  what ? 
  yeah , there was a [ 25th anniversary of baltic-nordic cooperation commemoration last year ] ( https://youtu.be/2hocv5ltt7m ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic-baltic_eight https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_investment_bank, 
  [ * usa used to be a world super power . 
  now the american people live in large piles of garbage . 
  * ] ( https://youtu.be/f2tdzshhrlw?t=21s ), 
   and for how long can lithuania or estonia count on being too poor to get refugees ? 
  when was this the case ? 
  both countries agreed to host refugees and are doing so . 
  what are you implying ? 
  that the most pro-eu countries will side with the v4 countries and antagonize our western partners ? 
  what is there to gain from that ? 
  i am no linguist , but `` dykas '' - `` empty , hollow , unoccupied , idle '' . 
  `` dykas '' + `` lithuanian place sufix '' = `` dykuma '' . 
  so `` dykuma '' means `` empty-place '' . 
  cognate to lithuanian d\u1ef9kas , latvian d\u012bks , proto-albanian * d\u012bk\u0101 , proto-slavic * dik\u044a ( wild , untamed ) , possibly to ancient greek \u03c3\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 ( s\u00edka , `` pig '' ) . 
  polandball is the reasonable one ... sure . 
  meanwhile somewhere in parallel universe : seems pretty dumb to take down a statue devoted to the millions who sacrificed themselves to make sure you do n't live under soviet rule today . 
  le pen must be jealous , because she did n't come up with it first . 
  recognition of independence, 
  yep , i understood it like that, 
  you forgot to thank iceland for that thing  : (, 
  i do n't even know french , but it seems that memes transcend language barriers . 
  that ostland though, 
  paging / u/ghaleon1, 
  now the arabs joined the low effort spamming too . 
   look good in glasses what 's the context ? 
  mark rutte, 
  i 've understood it like this : hi !, 
  well ( are ) you hoping to buy my pillow ? 
  for that is `` liels dibens '' and it/he sings lithuania 's anthem . 
  because some of the words are recognizable ( even if the words have completely different meaning ) : ** sveikas ** !, 
  proper lithuanian translation of your sentence : sveikas !, 
  `` ji '' ( she ) - because the word `` pap\u016bga '' is a feminine noun . 
  til there are secret hitler parades held annually in the three baltic countries . 
  could you share any pictures from the attendance ? 
   that the baltic states see this racist freak as more humane than stalin shows their warped mindset . 
  `` the baltics are the only ones that compare the soviet union to nazi germany , its a joke '' . 
  i see a contradiction here ? 
  so the baltic states see soviet and nazi crimes as equally disgusting actions or baltics prefer hitler because he had a sexier mustache ? 
  which one is it ? 
  you 're confusing me . 
   look for yourself the true plan hitler had for countries he deemed inferior and compare what the soviet union did it 's okay to murder millions of people so long as a racial component is n't the primary propaganda point . 
   hitler planned to kill hundred times more people and yet the baltic maniacs think he was a great guy . 
  til . 
   polish , lithuanian and portuguese will also be introduced as `` heritage languages '' on the leaving cert curriculum , aimed at immigrant communities . 
  only lithuanian immigrant children will be learning it . 
  seems weird to include uk . 
  those are ethnographic regions , not eu 's classification of territorial units for statistics - nuts ( nomenclature of territorial units for statistics ) . 
  what is eastern european culture ? 
  * erdogan will continue to provoke eu and portray it as an external enemy . 
  * no visa free travel for turks . 
  how do i know ? 
  tastiest kebabs in the city . 
  friends call him robodonger, 
  lithuania as prussia oriental ? 
  what ? 
   proof that the eu is fundamentally a racist enterprise . 
  a e s t h e t i c or a ** e e s t i ** c ? 
  it 's name is mora in the lithuanian version . 
  are you sure it 's not the 2000s version https://youtu.be/vvncf6hhwi8 ? 
  the baltic continent of course, 
  my friend went to work and live in usa and he was asked by his neighbor : `` do you have electricity in lithuania ? '', 
  and `` do you travel in horse carriages ? '' . 
  it was dead serious question . 
  my friend is a blond long haired metalhead btw . 
  he was butthurt about it for the longest time and moved to netherlands eventually . 
  overall he made a lot of friends with spanish speaking americans and learned some spanish . 
  you will find saunas all over lithuania , they vary throughout the country , depending on the region . 
  most of the saunas in lithuania are dry , similar to russian or scandinavian . 
  in rural tourism places as well as dry saunas , you might find a steam room in the same building . 
  i used to visit my grandma who lived in a village and sauna/pirtis was the only way to wash your body there until we installed a shower bath . 
  there 's a good article [ `` the culture of the the lithuanian pirtis is impacting both sides of the atlantic '' ] ( http://www.draugas.org/news/the-culture-of-the-the-lithuanian-pirtis-is-impacting-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/ ) if you 're interested . 
  i 'm actually bored to death by brexit , russia , poland , v4 vs eu , and nato-baltics threads, 
  this sub + / r/europe , because there is too big of an overlap of users who frequent both subs . 
  h2ppyme , nerkuras , aguywitharaygun , latvianlion , giveme50dollars , risiki , istencsaszar , idkfa_cz , sigakoer , pm_me_your_ladyboys , penki - , reineblanche , slyratchet , irimiash , anarchisto , eisenkatze to name a few . 
  there are far more regulars , but i ca n't name them all at the moment . 
  i think i could recognize something like ~ 50 users . 
  yes , although i have a hard time differentiating between spoken czech and polish .
