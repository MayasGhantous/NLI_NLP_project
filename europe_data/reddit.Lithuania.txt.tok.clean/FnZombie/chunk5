  time to leave and form regional unions ? 
  or hulk hogan, 
  did you think that those islands were independant nation states ? 
  apples and oranges, 
  sweden does n't complain, 
   russia , who can be a reliable partner to western europe at least if not the east . 
  xddddddd  it 's definitely a good thing to bypass eastern europe imo for the reasons you outlined ( reliability ) . 
  xddddd, 
   the baltic republics were also in opposition , but on wednesday latvia 's prime minister laimdota straujuma said that her country would abide by its duty to accept migrants if a majority of european union governments approved the juncker plan . 
  maybe estonia and latvia was . 
  as far as i remember our leaders have been ignoring our opinion about accepting refugees and are in favor of refugee quota plan . 
  no lollygagging, 
  `` kakis '' in lithuanian,

  lithuanian and latvian languages split in 7th century . 
  latvian and lithuanian languages split from a common ancestor . 
  you did , but not in your [ original comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jyffo/map_of_the_word_mammal_in_various_european/cuthav0 ) . 
  \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c does n't mean to flee either . 
  i think `` b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c / biega\u0107 '' is more common for east slavic languages . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jyffo/map_of_the_word_mammal_in_various_european/cuthav0  i think `` b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c '' is more common for east slavic languages . 
  b\u0113gt is a latvian word . 
  you 're the one `` manipulating '' . 
  what you should have wrote :  i think `` b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c '' is more common for baltic and east slavic languages or even better :  i think `` b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c '' is only retained between baltic and east slavic languages , rather than west slavic and south slavic . 
  edit : but that would n't be correct anyway since `` biega\u0107 '' exists in polish language . 
  you implied that latvian and lithuanian are east slavic languages , so stop playing your games . 
  your comment :  i think `` b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c '' is more common for east slavic languages . 
  my comment :  what * east slavic * languages have the word `` b\u0113gt '' ? 
  your answer :  russian `` bezhat '' latvian `` b\u0113gt '' lithuanian `` b\u0117gti '' polish `` uciec '' czech `` uprchnout '' all of those words mean `` to flee '' i know that czech republic and poland are eastern european countries , but their languages do n't belong to eastern slavic languages subgroup . 
  neither does latvian and lithuanian like you implied :  i think `` b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c '' is more common for east slavic languages . 
  [ turn your head to the right ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oj9it27.png ), 
   ca n't you read what i wrote ? 
  seriously . 
  once more : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages do you read your own sources ? 
  turn your head to right side edit : i 'll make it easier for you since you ca n't read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:slavic_languages_tree.svg, 
   latvian and lithuanian are part of baltoslavic branch , which consists of all slavic languages and baltic . 
  if you are dissatisfied with the link i provided . 
  you can search for yourself what languages are considered east slavic languages . 
  latvian and lithuanian are n't east slavic languages . 
  you should educate yourself . 
   i think `` b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c '' is more common for east slavic languages . 
  what east slavic languages have the word `` b\u0113gt '' ? 
  [ here ] ( http://vilnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/suicide.jpg ), 
  how so ? 
  last i remember kievan rus lands were conquered by lithuanians ? 
  and all the dukes that ruled later on were lithuanians ? 
  germany is n't in risk of becoming another russia 's region . 
  found the guy who thinks thats sanctions against russia somehow benefits the baltic states . 
  news flash idiot , we 're the countries most affected by them . 
  thanks man !, 
  hey , you were allies with one dictatorship before , maybe you could buddy up with a future one again ? 
  there 's a 144 million cultural identity next door, 
  check this guy 's comment history, 
  when did eu turn into european-middle eastern-african union ? 
  all of europe and usa is a product of the soviet union since , you know , they were anti-gay until just recently ? 
  yes, 
  hey , it 's something !, 
  i ca n't find what her recent ratings are , but she usually jumps down from being number one to number two and vice versa . 
  but it does n't mater since it 's her second presidential term . 
  i see our president is already warming up her future seat as european commissioner . 
   developing country https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/developing_country, 
  we still write in old church slavonic 's cyrillic, 
  they did/do receive education in polish , you can start school and finish university primarily in polish . 
  ministry of education wants more subjects in lithuanian in polish schools like for example in geography classes and similar . 
  these protesters do n't want more lessons in lithuanian language . 
   where poles are for example forced to change their surnames to lithuanian you mean write their names in latin symbols used by lithuanian state ? 
  i predict that there wo n't be any civil discussion in this thread , so i 'll just prepare popcorn . 
  that 's unfortunate, 
   now you have me confused . 
  you said that there were no russian , belarusian or ukrainian troops there that night , which i assume was meant ironically . 
  it 's a sarcastic comment , nobody should take it seriously . 
   so did or did not soviet troops murder the 13 lithuanian citizens ? 
  they did  does not the russian federation deny this happened ? 
  kremlin either ignores it or tries to whitewash it, 
  i would guess it 's because of `` senaties terminas '' ( the limitation period ) . 
  every few years the case is renewed since all charges/cases have `` expiration dates '' after which a person can not be held accountable anymore . 
  russian-lithuanians ? 
  this is the first time i hear something like this so i 'll assume there 's only a minority of them . 
  i would guess most of them belong to the communist party `` frontas '' led by paleckis who is well known soviet-crime denier and a stalinist . 
  `` 94 requests for legal assistance were sent to russia , belarus , and germany but received only negative responses '' since the event . 
  this could all been over in 90s if only our neighbors cooperated . 
  not the person who you replied to , but i do n't believe there any russian-lithuanians who believe that . 
  there were no russian , belarusian or ukrainian troops there that night . 
  the whole operation was executed by lithuanian self-defense units and communist heroes wanting to protect the fate of the baltic people against nationalist and extremist groups which took power and which advanced anti-socialist and russophobic propaganda . 
  people should have known the abyss into which they were being pushed by their nationalistic leaders . 
  the possible future consequences could be catastrophic to the lithuanian nation . 
  a question could arise as to their very existence . 
  also , lithuanians fired on their own , stalin did nothing wrong , you should be grateful that soviets liberated you , they built you roads and factories . 
  then do n't generalise half of a continent, 
  now replace a few words and see how ridiculous that sounds . 
   lithuania will take in all syrian refugees , but they have to be female, 
  i personally prefer turkey over russia any day, 
  being christian country is n't one of the requirements for potential candidates, 
  let 's not forget why `` anti-russian '' alliance was necessary in the first place , why so many countries joined it and what happens to those who do n't . 
  `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . '', 
  - dmitry rogozin , 2009 . 
  so how should the big bad west force russia to join nato ? 
  norwegians have three genders ? 
  does your ass get jealous of the shit that comes out of your mouth ? 
   nowadays capital of samogitia i do n't think you know where samogitia is located , pal .
