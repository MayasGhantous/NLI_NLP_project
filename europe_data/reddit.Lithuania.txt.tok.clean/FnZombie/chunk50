  this was how from the very beginning lithuanians got surnames of foreign origin . 
  among the privileged classes surnames took root much sooner ( in the first half of the 15th century ) where as among the peasants surnames became established as late as the 17th century or even later . 
  to the present time 50,000 surnames have been registered in lithuania . 
  the majority of them are of foreign origin derived from proper or common nouns of other languages . 
   surnames of lithuanian or baltic derivation constitute rather a small percentage . 
  their origin is usually traced to ancient lithuanian personal names such as budrys , girdenis , tylenis , vilkas , amantas , bukantas , rimgaila , vizgirda , tarvydas . 
  other surnames can be traced to common nouns which were used as nicknames such as baltakis `` white-eyed '' , didgalvis `` big-headed '' , kuprys `` hunchback '' , or to names of trades and professions such as dailide `` carpenter '' , kubilius `` cooper '' , puodzius `` potter '' , racius `` wheelwright '' , or even to place names such as bugailiskis `` from bugailiai '' , pazeimys `` from zeimys '' , puniskis `` from punia '' and so on . 
  surnames of foreign origin came to lithuania at different times and in different ways . 
  there are surnames of latin , greek , hebrew , slavic , germanic , tatar and other origin . 
  some came through direct contacts with the speakers of foreign languages , for example , the majority of slavic , germanic , jewish surnames ; others came via a third language , mostly via one of the slavic languages , as for example , the surnames of greek , roman and hebrew origin . 
   the greatest number of lithuanian surnames and first names are derived from greek names which came to lithuania via the slavic countries or western europe together with christianity , for example , aleksas , aleksandras , andrius , dionizas , eugenijus , ipolitas , jeronimas , jurgis , kipras , kristupas , leonidas , petras , steponas , zenonas . 
  moving from language to language these names changed their outer form and became the linking elements between different languages . 
  a lot of them developed into surnames , for example , andrius ( from gr . 
  andreas `` manly , courageous '' ) gave the following surnames andraitis , andriulis , andriejauskas , andriukaitis , andriukevicius , endrasius , endriukaitis , indriulaitis and others , 245 surnames have been derived from petras , 170 from grigas , 160 from jurgis , 145 from steponas , 140 from ambraziejus , 115 from aleksandras .

  budeliai - executioners \u0160lapimas - piss/wetness mi\u017eikai - pissers rojus - heaven mergalaukis - girl-field papi\u0161k\u0117 - `` boob '' - place plikiai - baldies b\u016bda - dog 's house nemirai - the undying ( sorta ) venecija - venice malta - malta \u0160veicarija - switzerland, 
  it 's always nice to hear something positive about lithuanian language, 
  lithuania : language is the most important thing and also the hardest thing to learn . 
  everything else does n't mater . 
  yes , i think culturally and politically usa seems much closer to uk , canada , australia and new zealand than jamaica or india . 
  but usa seems like it 's a bit distant from the rest of anglosphere countries , maybe because it 's been an independent country longer . 
  just my opinion . 
  stigma is already there that 's why these countries do n't like the label . 
  eastern european label wo n't be associated with warm hearted alcoholics and leaders in the it sector as long as eastern non-eu countries lag behind . 
  english and german . 
  german classes were very mediocre . 
  hard to speculiate since it was not a viable idea from the very start . 
  probably would have had a similar fate like yugoslavia . 
  lithuania is a centrist country because we ca n't make up our mind . 
  since lithuania restored it 's independence and a democratic system , voters have shifted from right to left and back again , swinging between the centre-right homeland union -- lithuanian christian democrats and centre-left social democratic party of lithuania . 
  although lithuanian farmers and greens union party won the most votes in the latest elections . 
  the far left/right parties are very unpopular here and do n't get parliament seats . 
  maybe one could consider parts of [ vilnius region ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/lithuania_territory_1939-1940.svg/1280px-lithuania_territory_1939-1940.svg.png ) as ` lost territories ' since only about one fifth of the region was ceded to lithuania . 
  nobody cares about the ` lost territories ' and most people do n't even know how big vilnius region actually was . 
  ** latvia ** : our closest neighbor , our brotherly nation . 
  lithuanians call latvians `` braliukas/braliukai '' . 
  we 're the remaining baltic nations , but lithuanian and latvian languages are hardly mutually intelligible . 
  lithuanian language sounds like `` drunk-baltic '' to latvians , while latvian sounds like `` provincial-baltic '' to us \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af . 
  there 's no bad blood between lithuanians and latvians , sometimes we like to circlejerk in various online forum threads . 
  ** belarus ** : lithuania and belarus has a very weird relationship , both countries are friendly to each other overall , but are on the opposite teams . 
  quite frankly modern belarus is terra incognita to both lithuania and europe , you do n't hear much about it and there 's little interaction with belorussians online . 
  i wish they spoke more belorussian at home and used english for online interactions . 
  ** poland ** : the stereotype - unwarranted sense of self-importance , always the victim in every conflict ( aka [ christ of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_of_europe ) ) , no sense of humor , when criticized resorts to whataboutism , thinks of other countries as inferior ( especially lithuania , belarus and ukraine ) . 
  on the other hand , i do n't have anything bad to say about the poles who do n't fit the stereotype . 
  poles that i met in poland , czechia and in my hometown were all decent and friendly people . 
  even the people online were friendly for the most part . 
  ** sweden ** : our sea neighbor . 
  in the 90s nordic countries were very interested in the baltic struggle for independence and provided political and financial support when other western countries were afraid of `` undermining peace in the post-ww2 europe '' . 
  does n't seem like there 's much interaction on the common folk level , although politically there 's various regional cooperation formats and projects . 
  a role model country overall \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af . 
  ** russia ** : could be so much more . 
  a liability to / r/askeurope because of their us-centric questions . 
  i believe the intention of this sub was for people to learn about europe and for europeans learn about each other ? 
  not to stroke american ego or satisfy their need for self-flagellation ? 
  specifically china and india . 
  the world 's two most populated countries that constitute 37 % of the world 's population together . 
  every second person in vilnius comes from those `` villages '' or has countryside roots ;p, 
  do we have a smug region ? 
  i do n't think we have `` regionalism '' here , because a lot of young people from around the country move to the biggest cities or emigrate to study or find a job . 
  there is a minority of people who identify as samogitians first and as lithuanians second , but i never met a smug samogitian . 
  it 's hard for me to pick one smug country , when there are so many smug countries in europe .

  you can frequently see him on [ tv giving his opinion on various subjects ] ( https://youtu.be/ac9u0dlszuc?t=59s ) or read his articles on various news websites . 
  i mean if you 're a nordic country why are n't you in the nordic council with the rest of nordic countries instead of baltic assembly ? 
  yes , i identify as lithuanian first , baltic second and european third . 
  latvians will always be `` braliukas '' ( brother ) , we are the last ethnic baltic people left and we need to stick together , also we never had bad blood between us , which is very rare between neighbors . 
  estonians were known to me as `` cousins '' until i learned that they do n't want to be associated with us which i find a tad hypocritical since they still cooperate the closest with latvia and lithuania through various supranational institutions and formats , also we sought to leave the soviet union peacefully as one unit and restore our statehood which was taken from us illegal through occupation . 
  remember the baltic way when two million people from lithuania , latvia and estonia held hands together as a protest ? 
  well , now estonia is nordic and the prettiest of them all . 
  it really feels like the whole baltic states friendship was forced on the baltics by the fact that we happened to be three cells mates in the same prison at the same time almost three decades ago . 
  to be honest , up to that point we kinda never were one region , it was always estonia + latvia and lithuania + poland or lithuania + belarus . 
  so no grudges there \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af . 
  i still hold a soft spot for our finnic neighbors estonia and finland , although to the later one we 're random eastern europeans , not considered to be part of the same region with them . 
  so imo there is an ethno-lingusitic baltic identity shared between latvians and lithuanians , although it 's not as tangible as nordic or scandinavian identity . 
  i ca n't say the same about the `` baltic states '' identity . 
  it 's called `` asymmetric intelligibility '' , but there 's still a substantial amount of false friends and loan words which are used differently or do n't exist in either latvian or lithuanian language , that prevents lithuanians and latvians from understanding each other . 
  also , written latvian is way more understandable , while spoken latvian completely shuts my brain down . 
  ethnic slurs : p\u0161ekai / \u0160l\u0117ktos - poles . 
  p\u0161ekai - because of the frequency of the `` harsh '' sounds ( cz , z , rz and etc ) in polish words . 
  \u0160l\u0117ktos - from `` szlachta '' ( privileged noble class in the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth ) , basically a slur to mock poles who think of themselves as better than `` peasant lithuanians '' ( native lithuanian nobility spoke polish and neglected the lithuanian language , while serfs spoke and preserved it ) . 
  from russian `` khokhol '' . 
  amerikonai - a combination of `` amerikie\u010diai '' ( americans ) and `` tarakonai '' ( cockroaches ) . 
  maskoliai - `` people of moscow '' ; kacapai - originally meant `` russian old believers '' , now a slur ; vatnikas - from russian `` vatnik '' - cheap cotton-padded jacket . 
  ruskiai - derogatory term for `` rusai '' ( russians ) . 
  labusi/labusai - lithuanians . 
  `` labas '' means `` hi '' in lithuanian . 
  latvia , i guess ? 
  long time ago my steam nickname for the video game left 4 dead was `` fucking zombies everywhere '' . 
  i shortened it to `` fnzombie '' for reddit , at that time i did n't know about the french far right party `` front national '' or `` fn '' for short . 
  on a very rare occasion redditors assume i 'm a supporter of that party .
