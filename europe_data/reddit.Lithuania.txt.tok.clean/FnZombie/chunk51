  it 's [ \u010cekija ] ( https://forvo.com/word/lt/%c4%8dekija_%5blt.%5d/#lt ) in my mother tongue , so naturally i prefer [ czechia ] ( https://forvo.com/word/czechia/#en ) . 
  if russia hypothetically changed one day and became something like germany , democratic , liberal , `` western '' , not even the most so called `` rusophobic '' countries would veto russia 's ascension , at least not for forever . 
  but the country would n't be russia ... now would it ? 
  did i win ? 
  our top three guesses for your english dialect : * us black vernacular / ebonics * american ( standard ) * singaporean our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : * dutch * english * norwegian, 
  no , usa guarantees my country 's independence . 
  there 's an old saying `` a lithuanian is happy when his neighbor 's house is on fire '' . 
  just a stereotype , although a stereotype nonetheless . 
  lithuanian cauldron : someone snitches on his neighbor if he is planning to escape . 
  it 's amazing , tauti\u0161ka giesm\u0117 achieves what an anthem should do - to rally the individual for the greater good of the collective and to feel proud . 
  it 's not anthem about war or spilling blood , but about unity and righteousness . 
  [ annually lithuanians all around the world sing tauti\u0161ka giesm\u0117 ] ( https://youtu.be/bjjf9sw4dvo ) . 
  also during sport events , especially basketball games : https://youtu.be/cznt0g0s27k https://youtu.be/nbo0gimauou https://youtu.be/j7chj29ql3y,

  famous examples : https://youtu.be/fyuw7f7siey https://youtu.be/o0gogigwwo4, 
  no one expects you to know any lithuanian phrases . 
  also locals will have an easier time understanding you if you speak english anyway . 
  anyone who speaks in a dialect instead of standard lithuanian is seen as a person from the countryside . 
  [ yesterday eu set a june deadline for poland and hungary to start admitting their share of migrants from overstretched italy and greece or risk sanctions . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4511928/eu-threatens-poland-hungary-sanctions.html ) . 
  the baltics wo n't risk sanctions over a few brown people that leave for sweden and germany anyway . 
  `` sunny '' and `` warm '' , because most people do not really know anything about portugal . 
  vasco da gama is mentioned in school books though . 
  white stork, 
  joining eu and nato in 2004 , impeachment of lithuania 's president , 2008 financial crisis , joining the euro zone . 
  [ dialects ] ( http://www.lituanus.org/1982_1/82_1_04.jpg ) . 
  but most just speak standard lithuanian with a dialectical word here and there . 
  but belgium is a multinational state equally divided between the two nations , i believe op is refering to small nation states . 
  you do n't have to deal with regionalism/separatism ? 
  well yeah . 
  every country has lower-class suburbans , in lithuania they 're called forsai or urlaganai by some . 
  any lithuanian village . 
  although ~ ~ lots of drinking ~ ~ `` how am i even alive ? '', 
  level of drinking , ~ ~ hardly ~ ~ for the most part intelligible and very distinctive dialects , conservatism , religious hypocrisy among the young and ~ ~ i 'd even venture to say gun ownership is above average here ~ ~ no guns , but those who have guns are hunters and not rednecks . 
  the only negative experience with foreigners : at mcdonald 's a darker looking fella ( possibly pakistani or indian ) tried to cut in line in front of me . 
  it was early in the morning , i was very hungry , there was a long queue . 
  so this guy decides to cut in the middle of a queue . 
  i was so mad , my blood was boiling and i started to gasp for air . 
  yes , i was this mad . 
  fortunately his friends called him to come over to them and i did n't have to faint or die in a fast food restaurant . 
  standard lithuanian is based on the southern sub-dialect of the western highlanders ' ( auk\u0161tai\u010diai ) dialect , nowadays also referred to as kauni\u0161ki\u0173 or in common speech suvalkie\u010di\u0173 . 
  it was the dialect of the scholar jonas jablonskis , one of the founders of the standard lithuanian language . 
  vidurio rytai - literally `` middle 's east '' . 
  artimieji rytai - close east . 
  `` m\u0113ms '' ? 
  i never considered anyone cool based on their nationality . 
  only specific people . 
  * 2000 - 2004 nothing remarkable * 2004 lithuania joins eu and nato . 
  also lithuania becomes the first european country to successfully impeach it 's president . 
  * 2008 economical growth halts . 
  global economical crisis . 
  * 2009-2014 `` meh '' * 2015 the lithuanian government reinstates conscription * 2016 - ... `` meh '', 
  that 's latvian, 
  i 'd argue that it 's `` parentland '' . 
  `` t\u0117vyn\u0117 '' from `` t\u0117vai '' ( parents ) and it means `` land of my parents '' , rather than from `` t\u0117vas '' ( father ) . 
  * we do n't like when strangers are too polite , just tell a stranger what you need . 
  * you should buy some souvenirs like matryoshka dolls , ask the locals where you could purchase authentic lithuanian matryoshkas . 
  * public transport is free . 
  * talking about the war is a good icebreaker for starting a meaningful conversation . 
  * compliment the country by saying that it 's such a nice place for a brand new young country like this . 
  soviets did a great job . 
  * do n't forget to compliment the country 's polish architecture . 
  friends : all of the eu and/or nato countries . 
  bros : latvia , estonia , georgia and iceland . 
  most people joke about it , others who have relatives in the uk are worried about them and emigrants living in the uk feel uncertainty . 
   have people assimilated ? 
  this might come as a shock , but refugees from the mena region adopted our cultural customs the best . 
  they stay in lithuania for a while and then flee to germany or sweden in search of better opportunities . 
   do you want more/less immigration ? 
  i do n't have a strong opinion about it . 
   from which country do you get most immigrants from ? 
  the top 3 countries are russia , ukraine and belarus . 
   who are the best/worst ? 
  no idea . 
  i like all of the historical periods where my country existed on a freaking map . 
  i have n't met anyone who felt any resentment towards germans . 
  nope . 
  to my untrained and unrefined ear it sounds like old slavonic . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://youtu.be/4w0kuqjgrh4 ) and [ 2 ] ( https://youtu.be/id3of4lr69w ) . 
  it 's a forgetable and bland song . 
  we 'll be the only baltic state to never win eurovision for another year ( or forever ) . 
  might as well require contestants to sing in lithuanian only . 
  the usual stuff : general bias towards `` eastern europeans '' , the sentiment that eu expansion was a mistake , brushing off everyone in `` eastern europe '' as homogenous blob made of a few identical countries , the attitude `` if your country gets eu funds - you ca n't critize eu '' , the occasional lithuanian vs polish reddit fights for the pettiest things , redditors from southern countries complaining about lack of solidarity from ee countries when in reality they should complain about two specific countries that i shall not mention , people prefering immigration from former colonies over `` third world ee countries '' , hell , one of the reasons why uk is leaving the eu is immigration from ee countries . 
  not to mention that submissions and comments made by western europeans , specifically people from germanic countries , generally get way more upvotes in this subreddit and / r/europe ( just an observation ) . 
  we are trully united in the eu ... 
  just south european ones , to be honest . 
  i 'm a bit of a eurofederalist , but i am also a patriot of my country . 
  i used to have a worldview which could be best described as `` euro-patriotism '' , but the attitude on reddit towards lithuanians by some folk shattered my illusions . 
  historically : mostly with poland and belarus ( something like ~ 500 years of common history i believe ) . 
  linguistically : with latvia . 
  politically : with latvia and estonia , and to some extent with the nordic countries . 
  also , lithuania stays on the good side of germany , usa and the eu . 
  culturally : with latvia and the central european countries , mostly with poland and germany . 
  socially ( based on personal experience ) : with latvians , estonians , czechs , slovenians and eastern germans . 
  i think poles are way more friendly than lithuanians . 
  genetically : with our baltic , slavic and finnic neighbors . 
  by temper : with poland , russia , ukraine and southern countries . 
  lithuania is hands down the most hot tempered of the three baltic states . 
  lithuanians sometimes suffer from siege mentality . 
  by amount of pure alcohol consumption : probably with latvia , poland , russia , finland and uk .
