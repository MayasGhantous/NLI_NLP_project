  well duh europe : [ \u00c6r\u00f8 ( denmark ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_%c3%86r%c3%b8.jpg ) and [ \u0141obez ( poland ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:pol_%c5%81obez_flag.svg ) non-euro : [ myanmar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_myanmar.svg ) and [ bol\u00edvar ( colombia ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_bol%c3%advar_ ( colombia \\ ) . svg ) honorable mentions : portugal , bulgaria , italy , ireland and hungary . 
   why is russia anti-western ? 
  because the political establishment wants to stay in power and they do n't want the people 's to think too much about the obvious mismanagement of the russian economy and the distribution of wealth . 
  that 's why the opposition in russia is so suppressed and so many putin critics/journalist are killed every year . 
  a very similar situation is in turkey with erdogan seeking more power and rallying people against the eu . 
   i hear that the reason for why it does n't want ukraine to be western aligned is because it wants ukraine , and other surrounding countries , to be buffer states against the west . 
  russia in general opposes eu 's eastern partnership initiative . 
  because the countries that get closer to the west benefit from the relationship . 
  compare former communist and former soviet states that got closer with the west and the one 's that did n't . 
  the ones that did are much richer and , sorry for the lack of better words , got their shit together . 
  the one 's that did n't are poor , corrupt and lag behind . 
  now if every russia 's neighbor got closer to the west and was doing better than russia , russians would start to question the government `` why are ukrainians and belorussians doing better than us ? '', 
  and blame the establishment for the mismanagement . 
  russian elites need poor countries around it to stay in power and enjoy the spoils . 
  that would undermine the fundamental idea of the european union . 
  it 's a european project , not euro-asian , euro-arabian , euro-atlantic and etc. 
  project . 
  i 'm fascinated by the grand duchy of lithuania and it 's grand dukes , but i feel a much stronger connection with the interwar lithuania/first independent republic of lithuania ( 1918-1940 ) . 
  the establishment of an independent lithuanian state was the culmination of the lithuanian national awakening and formation of a modern lithuanian identity . 
  i never heard a lithuanian accent portrayed in any way . 
  hannibal lecter who is supposed to be from lithuania [ does n't have a lithuanian accent ] ( https://youtu.be/fgy4vqfvyhc ) and marko ramius ( portrayed by sean connery ) in `` the hunt for red october '' had [ his normal sean-connery accent ] ( https://youtu.be/9itkorfmntg ) . 
  how it sounds like : * https://youtu.be/9awtics-eca * https://youtu.be/lm7b7fsopd8 * https://youtu.be/cwykaqvsdpm * https://youtu.be/0tqfq-jt2uy * https://youtu.be/hq8yfgmdfqu * https://youtu.be/6du7-9shg3i * https://youtu.be/xd3dm2iumc8?t=3m27s, 
  serbian folk music sounds oriental/turkish . 
  and remove kebab meme , of course . 
  idk if we have data like that . 
  well , the [ polish minority party keeps on trying to ban abortions in lithuania though ] ( http://www.liberties.eu/en/news/lithuania-abortion-ban-initiative ) . 
  liberal movement . 
  i like their stance on our ethnic and sexual minorities . 
  in these areas i think lithuania really needs a boost . 
  the party is also anti-populistic and pro-european . 
  it 's okey , we appreciate the effort . 
  good luck and have fun ( you wo n't ) .

  so spain , greece , germany and uk are culturally the same ? 
  we elected them as our rulling party - [ lithuanian farmers and greens union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_farmers_and_greens_union ) . 
  difference in prevalent social attitudes indeed exists . 
  cultural differences ? 
  how is slovenia and austria , estonia and finland or czechia and germany `` significantly '' different in culture ? 
  well , i 'll interpret `` eastern european '' as a term for former soviet block countries . 
  * decades under soviet rule did n't erase thousands of years of history and culture . 
  * most westerners do n't use the term `` eastern europe '' correctly when talking about geography or culture . 
  * some people romanticize communism ... well , if you want an authentic experience then go to a prison , enjoy the equality . 
  * some do n't understand that eastern europe is a very diverse place : different political climate , different ethnicities and cultures in general . 
  * people in the east are the same as the people the west , easterners just earn less money . 
  it 's not a different world . 
  * eastern european countries share cultural elements with the closest to them western european countries , no need to be afraid of the fact . 
  no , germany , you can not have memel back , either you take the whole lithuania or no deal . 
  yes . 
  named after [ nationalities/ethnicities and places ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mxetbdo.jpg ) . 
  ** social democratic party of lithuania ** - that former communist , who changed sides . 
  people do n't change . 
  ** homeland union -- lithuanian christian democrats ** - that competent , but arrogant person . 
  ** labour party ** - will sleep with entire locker room to be popular . 
  ** liberal movement ** - that kid that had a lot potential until he tried drugs that one time and got arrested . 
  ** order and justice ** - edgy kid with identity issues . 
  went from liberal to conservative . 
  would love to be friends with the cool kids and drop the act . 
  ** electoral action of poles in lithuania ** - the kid that just cares about nothing else but himself and is just an asshole in general . 
  nobody knows who hurt him . 
  ** lithuanian farmers and greens union ** - new kid from the province who became popular out of nowhere . 
  never does drugs or alcohol . 
  not everyone watches basketball , but it is the most popular sport here . 
  any other stereotype we have ? 
  buses have multiple exits so no . 
  i only say `` thank you , goodbye '' to the taxi driver . 
  `` eik tu nahui '' is the most popular . 
  swearing a lot in russian . 
  like `` tiedu '' instead of `` jie '' . 
  `` abudu '' is still used . 
  exhale air, 
  latvians ... english | latvian | lithuanian : -------- | : -------- :| --------- : deer | briedis | elnias elk | alnis | briedis also do n't let the sjw 's know about the `` lack of genders '' in finno-ugric languages . 
  for example , `` he/she '' in estonian is `` ta ( or tema ) '' ; finnish `` h\u00e4n '' is gender-neutral and means both `` he '' and `` she '' . 
  * `` go to dwarves '' - `` eiti pas nyk\u0161tukus '' ( go to the toilet ) * `` to slice a mushroom '' - `` gryb\u0105 pjauti '' ( to make no sense ; to talk shit ; to be useless ) * `` leave somebody on the ice '' - `` palikti ant ledo '' ( abandon/betray somebody ) * `` do n't blow arabians '' - `` nep\u016bsk arab\u0173 '' ( do n't talk nonsense ) * `` hang pasta on the ears '' - `` kabinti makaronus '' ( to lie ) * `` let 's go clarify our relationship '' - `` einam ai\u0161kintis santykius '' ( let 's fight ) * `` a face unharmed by intellect '' - `` intelektu nesu\u017ealotas veidas '' ( a person is stupid ) * `` devils did n't see '' - `` velniai nemat\u0117 '' ( `` whatever ...

  chrome , music player and m.ticket ( for public transport ) . 
  `` eik pasikark '' : go hang yourself . 
  they came up with the greatest and widest tax evasion schemes , went `` bankrupt '' and a far poorer and less economically developed eurozone country had to provide financial aid for them . 
  the arrogance , making a scapegoat of germany instead of blaming their own government and electing a populist pseudo-communist party did n't win me over either . 
  but that 's just my two cents . 
  apart from that a common greek is always welcome to have a beer with me . 
  no way . 
  far-right and far-left parties are extremely unpopular here . 
  seldom , but only when making fun of americans . 
  i feel like a stereotype . 
  i only remember being very excited to start learning it . 
  maybe this video could help https://youtu.be/vt4dfa4foey . 
  it 's because the stress in latvian language always falls on the first syllable of a word , in lithuanian any syllable can be stressed and the stress can move in inflected forms . 
  [ lithuanian accentuation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_accentuation ) . 
  well , according to brits everything east of germany sounds russian . 
  i 've seen people describing lithuanian as portuguese-czech mix , polish-latin/romance mix , portuguese-russian and as `` drunk latgalian '' by latvians . 
  it 's seems to be a mistake . 
  the map was made based on `` p. jordan , gro\u00dfgliederung europas nach kulturr\u00e4umlichen kriterien , europa regional , 13 . 
  [ link to the passage ( pdf ) ] ( http://www.stagn.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/stagn_publikationen/070829_text_er4_05_jordan.pdf?__blob=publicationfile&amp;v=5 ) . 
  because of historical and cultural connections . 
  although politically and geographically baltics do n't fit into central europe . 
  [ according to this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/centraleurope2.png ) it extends to croatia , serbia and romania . 
  it 's a pleasant surprise when you do n't expect anything . 
  it 's a bit weird .
