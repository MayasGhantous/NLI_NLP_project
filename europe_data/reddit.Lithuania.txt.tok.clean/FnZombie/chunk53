  nobody , they all die . 
  aparently it 's called `` ampersendas '' . 
  although , most people would call it '' \u017eenklas `` ir '' ( symbol `` and '' ) '' or `` simbolis ` ir ' '' . 
  doit\u0161landija and iostereichas . 
  easy peasy lemon squeezy . 
  there 's different suffixes , genders ...  .  for example : masculine - lietuvis , feminine - lietuv\u0117 ( a person from lietuva ) , masc . 
  - \u017dv\u0117rynietis , fem - \u017dv\u0117ryniet\u0117 ( a person from an eldership of \u017dv\u0117rynas in vilnius ) so i am a \u017dv\u0117rynietis , vilnietis , auk\u0161taitis , lietuvis . 
  do n't whistle indoors - you 'll call the devil . 
  shaking hands through a threshold brings bad luck . 
  killing spiders is considered to bring bad luck . 
  do n't place your bag on the floor - you 'll lose money . 
  when you hear the first cuckoo call , it is very important that you have money in your pocket or you 'll lose money . 
  shattering glass is good luck , shattering a mirror is bad luck . 
  to avoid bad luck is to spit over your left shoulder three times . 
  ** y ** anis var ** ou ** fakis in lithuanian is ** j ** anis var ** au ** fakis . 
  i guess jonas jonaitis in greek would be yonas yonaitis ? 
  wow , til i 'd get a panic attack if i lived in germany . 
  and these two are divided into subdialects : samogitian is divided into west , north and south ; auk\u0161taitian into west ( suvalkie\u010diai ) , south ( dz\u016bkai ) and east . 
  each subdialect is divided into smaller units -- speeches . 
  standard lithuanian is derived mostly from western auk\u0161taitian dialects . 
  samogitian differs from standard lithuanian quite significantly , it could very well be considered a different language . 
  as someone who 's family is from auk\u0161taitija , i find samogitian dialect extremely interesting . 
  it even sounds completely different from standard lithuanian . 
  just a few lithuanian folks writing in english between each other for no reason . 
  pretending like it 's a popular sub with foreigners or something . 
  mostly dead since nothing interesting happens in lithuania most of the time . 
  regarding sweden ? 
  just a disco song , i did n't want to post \u15c5\u15fa\u15f7\u15c5 .

  i 'm certain that they do n't, 
  sorry , but an average lithuanian does n't know about kurds . 
  the biggest problem i face when speaking hungarian is that i do n't know any hungarian words . 
  somebody should have explained to the music clip director that the seven dragon balls grant a wish . 
  they do n't fight people ... was the song popular in germany ? 
   our dragon ball intro was very different though ( still amazing ! ), 
  interesting choice of music for the intro . 
  we just had the japanese intro , but the animated tv series was called `` dragons ' fight '' ( drakon\u0173 kova ) instead . 
  our national tv channels ( lnk and tv3 ) showed great cartoons , but thank god cartoon network and fox kids was available : * [ dragon ball ] ( https://youtu.be/x7kzvh849eo ) * bolek and lolek * x men ( [ the intro still h y p e s me up ] ( https://youtu.be/sakl2-vh2sk ) ) * [ spider-man ] ( https://youtu.be/dzgn9fzvqhc ) * [ batman : the animated series ] ( https://youtu.be/kllodazwp2m ) * [ transformers ] ( https://youtu.be/yo45xy6k8ze ) * [ mike , lu & og ] ( https://youtu.be/tdimvhdrxb4 ) * [ oggy and the cockroaches ] ( https://youtu.be/l3qekjxwdku ) * [ ed , edd n eddy ] ( https://youtu.be/hrwt_4tnx4q ) honorable mentions : [ the tick ] ( https://youtu.be/cuw0lj5cfuq ) , pink panther , [ the mask ] ( https://youtu.be/kzdr421ekv8 ) , [ ironman ] ( https://youtu.be/qzha8ox2kcy ) . 
  of course not . 
  in a globalized world everyone dresses the same . 
  [ this ] ( http://i2.alfi.lt/21988/20/50.jpg ), 
   belarus is not part of lithuania but has a lot of significance in lithuanian history we do n't learn anything about belarus to be honest ... apart from battle of orsha . 
  return of conscription, 
  probably from the 13th to 15th century . 
  lithuania was h u g e. although economically that golden age is yet to come . 
  every time a republican or a democrat candidate wins - there 's a mass hysteria from either side . 
  america is pretty fucked in my opinion . 
  if he did something that warranted it , sure . 
  nope , you 'll get a fine or prison time ( up to two years ) . 
  my school had it . 
  in 10th , 11th and 12th grade political lessons replaced history for one semester . 
  nobody complained , everyone kinda liked it . 
  the same in lithuania . 
  tu - informal , j\u016bs - formal . 
  there 's also sir/mr/mrs - ponas/ponia/panel \u0117 , of course . 
  but it fell out of popularity , i only remember hearing it used by shopkeepers or people being passive aggressive though ( `` listen here , ponas !, 
  '' , `` oh , look , what ponas these one is '' ) . 
  when addressing an elder you can also use senjoras/senjor \u0117 , which is a respectful way to call someone who is a pensioner , because `` pensininkas/pensinink \u0117 '' has a bit of negative connotation . 
  old men with mustaches and young men with shaved heads . 
  also colorful folk dresses . 
  none of us are trump people . 
  we do n't appreciate shit-posting because someone 's candidate did n't win the election . 
  i 'd support op being banned from traveling to europe though . 
  not worth ruining our relations over this . 
  mindaugas - his parents forgot to change the default lithuanian name after they made their baby . 
  mindaugas was a cool dude so it 's understandable . 
  laura - another name that is too popular . 
  pilypas - his parents probably hate him . 
  popular old lithuanian saying `` like a phillip from cannabis field '' - someone who 's clueless . 
  jonas , petras , albinas , janina , ona , stas\u0117 , barbora , adolfas , aleksas - old people names . 
  popular names nowadays because parents want to be hip : kajus , domas , emilis , emilija , vilt\u0117 , ema , l\u0117ja , lukn\u0117 . 
  so countering one lunacy with another lunacy will achieve what exactly ? 
  europe does n't need any `` far - '' movements .

  every nation has the right of self-determination through peaceful and most importantly legal means . 
  european yes , but i do n't feel connected to all of the countries . 
  lithuanian music or art is n't popular at all outside the country . 
  but if a had to pick one popular piece of classical music , i guess it would be [ mikalojus konstantinas \u010ciurlionis - mi\u0161ke ] ( https://youtu.be/mzeh7xrmflg ) . 
  anything that hides grey brutalist apartment buildings is good . 
  pick the language that will be useful for you in the future . 
  if you do n't plan to live in a russian speaking country or have business relationship with russian companies then it 's it will be a waste of time learning it . 
  while german is one of the official working languages in the eu . 
  motivation is important too , if you want to learn russian then just learn russian , because learning a language that you find boring ( german in your case ) is stressful .

  personally , i ca n't take the jamaican accent seriously . 
  it 's too comical for me . 
  like someone trying to invent a new language by botching the pronouciation and adding slang words . 
  our humour consists of black comedy and politicians being roasted or mocked . 
  i 'd say it 's good overall . 
  as in leaving the eu and forming a union ?
