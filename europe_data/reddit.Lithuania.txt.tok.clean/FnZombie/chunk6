  not against my country but a less known incident : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007, 
  that makes two of us, 
  maybe the problem is your way of seeing things ? 
  maybe you 're not always right ? 
  for example ,  however , when someone calls the more left-winged users literal `` putinbots '' , for something they have n't even done yet , it seems perfectly acceptable . 
  no one called a left-wing user a putinbot here yet . 
  do you have a victim complex ? 
  and what does right-wing reactionary conservative russia has to do with left-wing ideologies/parties ? 
  i do n't think `` upgraded '' was the word you were looking for, 
  what does lithuania have to do with the balkans ? 
  [ we used to have passports in green color ] ( https://www.dokumentai.lt/images/dok/e-pasas.gif ), 
  across europe : german , russian across world : spanish , french, 
  february 11 , 1991 never forget, 
  well , it 's complicated . 
  here 's the short story : late 19th - early 20th century was a time of lithuanian national revival . 
  you see , because of long period of common polish-lithuanian statehood and russification that followed in russian empire , lithuanian language was n't perceived as `` prestigious '' for middle and higher classes to be used ( they spoke polish ) , basically lithuanian was only spoken in rural areas , western lithuania ( samogitia region ) and kleinlitauen ( lithuania minor ) in east prussia . 
  after the abolition of serfdom in the russian empire , emerging lithuanian national movement sought to distance itself not only from russia , but also and mostly from polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  seimas ( our parliament ) wanted to distance itself from the flag of the grand duchy of lithuania , which also encompassed belarus and ukraine . 
  a flag representing a national lithuania was needed , so the three frequently used colors were chosen from folk weavings and traditional dresses . 
  yellow , green , red tricolor was chosen as a `` temporal flag '' until a new one could be adopted , but a coup happened and any discussion for the national flag was delayed until 1940 when a new `` yellow , red , white '' flag was proposed but not adopted , then a soviet occupation happened and the flag was banned , then our state was reestablished as continuation of interwar lithuania and because of that soviet ban our interwar lithuania 's flag/current tricolor represents lithuania 's fight for freedom and self-determination . 
  btw [ a different flag representing lithuanians existed in lithuania minor since at least 17th century ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/flag_of_lithuania_minor.svg ) . 
  yes, 
  i just want to able to use [ our state flag - vytis ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/flag_of_lithuania_%28state%29.svg/1600px-flag_of_lithuania_%28state%29.svg.png ) as a flair . 
  according to the article it 's more of a joint russian-belorusian exercise with serbia bum rushing to be part of it too . 
  strangely enough i 'm okay with this, 
  someone is geographically challenged, 
   anthony kied ** is ** tho ? 
  _  - eid ** is **, 
  nationalist . 
   our taste and your . . size \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  except poland does n't have monopoly over him . 
  do n't be a retard like those few lithuanians downvoted somewhere below . 
  not everyone is brainwashed like them . 
  this is higher-magic, 
  probably . 
  for the record i did n't suggest that . 
   so you think that they should have an easier exams ? 
  what 's done is done . 
  keep in mind , that because of learning polish and lithuanian , their english language skills suffer . 
  and if you 'll suggest `` they should learn lithuanian as native language ! '', 
  that pretty much eliminates them being natively polish . 
   and please explain why does the llra keeps getting so many votes in polish populated regions if the polish minority are so loyal ? 
  polish people are n't one hivemind that all vote for one party . 
  last election llra had to take part in seimas elections as coalition with `` political party russian alliance '' to win merely 5,83 % of votes ( 5 % is the threshold ) , i know for a fact that my polish-lithuanian colleagues voted for the conservatives . 
  came to say the same thing . 
  curse you !, 
  we have a large polish minority . 
  we also have shitty media that likes to spin thing the way they like and generate hatred which leads to them writing articles with provocative headlines which in turn leads to making more money . 
  for example , a wish for a simple thing like bilingual signs were portrayed as polish chauvinism , minority schools getting scared because of our ministry of education out of nowhere deciding that from now on minorities would have to pass exactly the same exams like native lithuanians as `` poles ca n't speak the official language lol '' , poland reacting to all of this as `` poland sticking it 's nose into lithuania 's internal politics . 
  who gave them the right to dictate us what to do in our own country ?! '' . 
  now we have citizens who actually know poles and citizens who believe that our lithuanian poles are disloyal , do n't speak lithuanian and hate lithuania . 
  a pro-kremlin polish-lithuanian politician managed to build a successful career out of all this . 
  all of this drama ruined the relationship between poland and lithuania . 
  only after the war in ukraine started did relationship between poland and lithuania started to improve . 
  for better understanding think of our largest and most influential news website `` delfi.lt '' as fox news . 
  i find it strange how a foreign country can decide that a child without uk citizenship ( but with a foreign one ) can be adopted by their citizens and ignore latvia 's government . 
  now we have a 7 years old latvian kid with british parents , who 'll be culturally british , will speak english natively , but have a latvian citizenship if everything stays like it does now . 
  this odd situation could lead to a problematic future for the person in question . 
  imo , the child should either be returned to latvia and , like you said , be separated from his current parents or be given a british citizenship . 
   the child was found in england and is protected by english law because of it . 
  yes . 
  hopefully british officials will sort this out with latvian officials and returns the child to her home country and not kidnapes a foreign citizen . 
   if i go to latvia and do something stupid , i get prosecuted under latvian law not sent to england to be trialed . 
  a child is n't acountable for her parent 's actions . 
  the story is about a latvian citizen who was neglected by her parents . 
  parents were punished under british law . 
  because 21 months old child does n't decide to emigrate, 
   she was 21 months old when removed from her mother woops , i missed this part , i saw 7 years old and my brain shut-down, 
  idk about you but when i was seven years old i only spoke my native language which helped me find friends since , you know , they spoke the same language . 
  but anyway , it 's her native country 's responsibility to take care of it 's citizens . 
  the child is a latvian citizen . 
  if the child must be adopted she should be adopted by latvians in her home country . 
  i 'd recommend drinking cold lithuanian beer in the summer . 
  hot temperature and vodka do n't mix too well . 
  separitism is illegal according to russian law , it 's the most militarised place in europe and the region could n't sustain itself . 
  we do n't have `` w '' in our alphabet, 
  one was 6 years old , the other was forced into red army , took berlin and won the war . 
  what did your grandfathers do ? 
  russia stronk , burn flowers that were already paid for , europe weak , suck it , europe ? 
  can we burn kremlin 's never ending propaganda ? 
  well , he did have estonian citizenship . 
   i would say that it 's a good thing that they won . 
  not op , but i 'd say it would have been a good thing if both lost . 
   russophobic using this term so loosely is really disrespectful to groups who are actually persecuted and discriminated . 
  like homosexuals in russia . 
  you commie crime deniers are as sickening as holocaust deniers . 
  and yet prouds it 's collapse as the bigest catastrophe of the 20th century and whitewashes the crimes committed by the regime . 
  i do n't support war and putin did nothing wrong ? 
  * eu is making everything intentionally worse . 
  * there 's a pedophile lawyer ring controling lithuania 's judicial system . 
   \u0161s what an abomination . 
  these two letters should never touch . 
   i would n't expect things to get better you mean it would get better if this sub supported russia in it 's hybrid war against ukraine ? 
  `` vl\u00e4diimir '' , but friends call him `` nordicmir '', 
  lithuania : 7.8 * get satisfied latvia ( 7.3 ) and estonia ( 7.2 ) *, 
  `` godus '' is the correct lithuanian word . 
  `` sk\u016bpas '' is lithuanized slavicism that according to our beloved lituanists should not be used . 
  `` mr. medvedev , open this gate . 
  mr. medvedev , tear down this firewall '', 
  go for it !,
