   so just america then . 
  yeah , pretty much the same as it is right now, 
  i think there would n't a east-west divide if european countries just gave their sovereignty to russia . 
  imagine what good relationship former-eu member states could have with russia if that happened . 
  you 're giving too much credit to kremlin . 
  they are just reactionaries with tit-for-tat policies . 
   sucks to be you lithuania sucks to know languages ? 
  russian language was a must in soviet union . 
  now english has replaced russian as `` language of interethnic communication '' hehe . 
  however , one can learn russian or german or french as the third compulsory language in school/university . 
  may he rest in peace . 
  probably divided into two blocs : north and south . 
  nope , this is the first time i saw something like this . 
  will the next project be something like `` youth summer gulags '' ? 
  that 's the joke , it 's impossible to make everyone happy, 
  i got the impression that he thought that lithuanians secretly can speak russian but refuses to or that we purposely do n't learn russian ( because we must for some reason ) . 
  russian , polish , english , french and bonus points for learning any of the nordic languages . 
  palanga mostly orientates to russian tourists . 
  it does n't surprise me that nobody spoke english there . 
  and many locals joke that it 's cheaper to travel to turkey for holidays than palanga . 
  i 've overheard a belorussian foreign exchange student talking to his colleagues and he said that `` lithuanians are just like french , but instead of refusing to speak english they refuse to speak russian '' . 
  that was mind-boggling , that student thought that all lithuanians know russian but just refuse to speak it because of pride ... 
  country 's leader = / = people, 
  the fruit is `` apelsinas '' , the color is `` oran\u017ein\u0117 '' . 
  oh he pronounced it as `` ass '' ... 
  \u010c and \u017d too, 
  es sounds similar to a\u0161 . 
  latvian | lithuanian | latgalian | samogitian | prussian : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- es | a\u0161 | as | a\u0161 | as, 
  what ? 
  rip gudija , long live whiterussia, 
  `` russophobic '' is the new `` fascist '', 
  that 's all russia 's neighbours, 
  are n't we supposed to be `` russophobic american lapdogs '' ? 
  minus lithuania ofc, 
  i like this one since it 's not offensive to x country 's neighbours like the others . 
  ah cultured old neighbour how we miss you . 
  i 've met more than enough poles in my life that someone like pathological lithuanian hater/troll ama_deo could n't ruin positive image of polish people and poland that i hold . 
  redditor for 46min . 
  lithuania is small dog barking . 
  are you from / r/russia ? 
  since they love insult everyone west of them and this is pretty textbook insult for any baltic country . 
  strange how in poland i had a wonderful experience with everyone being so friendly to me because of my lithuanian car numbers . 
  did n't encounter any prejudice . 
  does this reputation exist between poles living in the german side of poland ? 
   there were 121,345 speakers of lithuanian in the prussian census of 1890 if not for [ prussian-lithuanians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_lithuanians ) living in [ kleinlitauen/lithuania minor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuania_minor ) we probably would n't speak lithuanian right now . 
  i mean kazakhstan 's official language is russian ... 
  if they tried to break off from moscow hegemony , we would see `` crimea 2.0 : electric boogaloo '' . 
  i would n't count out current minorities in both countries, 
  [ no seriously , that 's a real thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ), 
   lithuanian socialist polish-lithuanian, 
  [ video source in lithunian ] ( http://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/1255603/gatviu-stulpeliais-issprestas-dvikalbiu-lenteliu-klausimas ) basically , vilnius council put street signs with lithuanian street names in the beginning and the ending of the streets + nobody will take down polish or bilingual signs from houses . 
  local poles and politicians are satisfied with this . 
   `` a russian citizen can not be sent beyond the borders of the russian federation or given to another state '' one of those thing i wish lithuania adopted from russia, 
  i think ukraine has a bigger army than we do, 
  do they speak polish ? 
  or ukrainian and polish are mutually intelligible ? 
  i would like to mention austria too . 
  they arrested mikhail golovatov ( ex-commander of elite soviet troops who participated in soviet assault on a vilnius television tower in january 13 , 1991 ) back in 2011 and released him the next day , because `` fuck you , who cares about your trial , we want cheap russian gas '' . 
  do you swear ? 
  those are n't anymore , get with the times !, 
   sejm , not sejmas !, 
  what about latvian `` saeima '' ? 
  muh nato bombings !, 
  ca n't wait for ethnic tensions !, 
  once again baltic states are grouped as one entity, 
  [ til that bagpipe is one of our traditional instruments ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d\u016bdmai\u0161is ), 
  thank you !, 
  [ we have national flag and state flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_flags_of_lithuania ) , but it does n't count :(, 
   baltic and slavic share linguistic traits that are unique to them . 
  most indo-europeanists classify baltic and slavic languages into a single branch , the dispute mostly stems from political , not academic reasons . 
  you should have read the article i linked . 
  some linguists used to group finno - ugric - altaic languages together ...  and what about the existence of lithuanian before the 14th century ? 
  there 's no written records of that as well . 
  but the language exists currently, 
  it 's a scientific speculation based on the idea that some shared linguistic innovations = common proto-language . 
  and if it 's a scientific fact where are the proofs ? 
  any balto-slavic written sources ? 
  because this map implies that there was a common baltic-slavic language which probably did n't exist since there is no proof of it 's existance . 
  you could come up with the word yourself and it would be as legitimate as this theory . 
  paradoxally , russia 's neighbours who were hit the most by sanctions are the ones least complaining . 
  i 'd say this article was written perfectly to portray events the way author wants them to be portrayed . 
  of course , lithuanian judges are literally nazis because they wanted to investigate events in which yitzhak aradtook part before he fled lithuania in 1945 . 
  aradtook could n't have committed any war crimes since he 's jewish , therefore he 's innocent for his involvement in shooting armia krajowa officer , execution of pow , burning down of a village and who knows what else . 
  i wonder why mr. aradtook is afraid to be trialed if he 's innocent ? 
  btw the case was dropped because israel refused to cooperate since mr. aradtook was part of israel defense forces back in the days . 
  i do n't , since low quality submissions or non credible sources are down-voted by the community . 
  borders only exist in people 's mind . 
   were you there ? 
  ftfy, 
  do we get the `` latvian names '' expansion pack in addition to the current lithuanian ones ? 
  you do n't need to know lithuanian to go to uk or france , just like you do n't need english to go to reddit .
