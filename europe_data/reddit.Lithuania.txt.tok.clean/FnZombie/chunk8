  i find it intriguing how 2 years ago ukrainians shared the same romantic view of soviet union with russians , of course , with the exception of holodomor , but now political alignment has changed and so has the view on history . 
  so now modern ukraine identifies itself with ukrainian people 's republic instead of ukrainian soviet socialist republic ? 
  you might say ... we 're closer to nordic countries ? 
   europe has spent hundreds of years happily exploiting their labour and resources where 's my exploited labour and resources ? 
  estonia : mandariinid poland : ida sweden : the girl with the dragon tattoo france : ast\u00e9rix and ob\u00e9lix films uk : snatch ; in bruges ; lock , stock and two smoking barrels spain : pan 's labyrinth germany : downfall ; not a movie , but i enjoy watching episodes of deutschland 83 . 
  not everyone in eastern europe are slavs, 
  how many greek troops are there in poland ? 
  forbidding mentioning certain names in the press is uncommon for democratic countries , baning works not so much . 
  ukraine has a long road ahead of itself if it wants to become a fully democratic country and not stay like a belarus/russia type country . 
  banning someone has n't made anyone fascist yet, 
  finland was part of sweden from 12th until early 19th century . 
  swedish speaking finns are native ethnic finns , who are a linguistic minority , not a seperate ethnic one . 
   which state forces their own citizens to speak the only official language ? 
  like every national state with official language ? 
   also you did n't give me statistics about how russian estonians are making 90 % another user did that : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e42cl/people_with_hivaids_in_europe_as_of_population/ctbe88f, 
  i do n't know about the hesburger one , but cola in the can and plastic bottle taste differently because of their packaging . 
  / r/russia is leaking, 
  i 'd say we 'd be as unimportant and infantile as current eu, 
  latvia + lithuania = baltija/republic of baltia ; estonia + finland = finland/republic of finland lol, 
  yeah sure , hollande , only six countries , but without france . 
  baltic countries thought they were joining european union , not frankish empire 2.0 or another soviet union . 
  there was no partnership in su , only commands from moscow . 
  the base of western civilization is greco-roman culture . 
  saying greeks are n't europeans makes you not a european . 
  unless what you really meant was `` greeks are n't white '' ? 
   western countries became not-western because of soviet ~ ~ ocupation ~ ~ liberation and had to hate ~ ~ western ~ ~ america 's lapdog capitalists because ~ ~ moscow said so ~ ~ stalinism was superior and everyone else was nazi . 
   that is our unilateral step towards peace . 
  we are showing the whole world that we are fulfilling the minsk agreement a bit delayed ? 
  of course they 're talking about peace since they 're getting their asses kicked . 
   `` if the ukrainian side attempts to breach the front line , or conducts shelling endangering the lives of civilians or donetsk army '' so these `` rebels '' will do what they have been doing - provoke ua army by shooting at them or shelling their positions and cry wolf about nazi kiev killing civilians while hiding in civilian areas like cowards . 
  you wo n't get a sensible discussion from a person who writes :  i 'd cap the world population at around 3 billion . 
  over that people would randomly be selected by a computer to instantly die . 
  i 'd also remove religion and the obsessive use of political correctness . 
   there 's `` the east '' , which includes russia , ukraine , belarus , sometimes also romania , balkans and baltic states . 
  we 're on top of you , by that logic poland is sometimes eastern europe too ? 
  every pre-protestant country was catholic, 
  with the new cold war started we 'll be relevant for a long time . 
  us being something like west germany of 21 century . 
  i like it, 
  northern , but not nordic . 
  well , you know ... [ russia is as eastern as it gets ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/russian_federation_%28orthographic_projection%29_-_crimea_disputed.svg/541px-russian_federation_%28orthographic_projection%29_-_crimea_disputed.svg.png ), 
  that 's just stating a fact . 
  when lithuania declared independence everyone got a lithuanian citizenship no questions asked , latvia and estonia have non-citizens and we have non-lithuanian speakers with lithuanian citizenships . 
  your citizenship does n't define your loyalty though, 
  ukraine 's situation : join russia - your quality of life improves . 
  that 's not the case with lithuania and russia . 
  doubt that, 
  where are they happy ? 
  so russians ? 
  ask russia , it was a gift, 
  your '' \u012b '' is our `` y '' . 
  but why latvians use the german name for vilnius ? 
  what do latvians call the river `` vilnia/vilnel \u0117 '' then ? 
  when people use the term `` eastern european '' they have in mind [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dmw4wby.png ) , when it should look more like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u8wmkp1.png ) . 
  when will this cold war mentality fade away ? 
  what does yellow , green , red , blue and white on the tower symbolizes ? 
  organizers downloaded the anthem from the internet, 
  latvian ^ hehe ^ hehe ^ hehe ^ hehe, 
  [ greece , do you have a spare island ? 
  by whom ? 
  well , acording to some nords , baltics are n't northern european . 
  that 's the impression i got from this sub . 
  finally something positive posted here about my country instead of usual western/northern circklejerk and it gets downvoted ( currently 9 points ( 61 % upvoted ) ) . 
  you said 20k per year for estonia - 1,3 mill . 
  pop . 
  ( 69 % natives ) , latvia - 2 mill . 
  ( natives 62 % ) , lithuania - 3 mill . 
  only lithuania could take in 20k refugees , latvia and estonia have problems with their russian minorities since soviet collapse . 
  well germans do n't say `` you know what , maybe hitler killed a lot of people , but he was a great leader overall . 
  he fixed germany 's economy and made it a superpower '' for us to express our hatred for them fascists so often . 
  you know that both nazi and soviet crimes are condemned here in lithuania ? 
  where did i say that ? 
  i 'm not right wing . 
  please refrain from insults and ad hominem . 
  latvia and estonia already took a lot of refugees from soviet union that constitutes large part of their total population . 
  20k per year for lithuania with barely 3 mil . 
  population and one of the hardest languages to learn seems unreasonable . 
  would you like to extinct baltic and finnic languages ? 
  and how will that affect baltic states or are you just lumping all of former iron curtain states since you lack knowledge about them ? 
   i imagine eastern europe , from the baltics to athens , is going to see a drastic raise in fascist parties . 
  based on what ? 
  you have a very wild imagination . 
  is it still gay if a dude blows another dude and says no homo afterwards ? 
  eu does n't approve of crooked bananas . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commission_regulation_ ( ec ) _ no . _ 2257/94, 
  i 'll save you a couple of seconds on google search http://www.grutoparkas.lt/?lang=gb https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr\u016btas_park  and i will not visit lithuania or any other eu country in the near future and i hope that i will not do that ever . 
  why is that ? 
  read the last part of my comment, 
  i wrote what the average citizen thinks, 
  `` we do n't want to pay for greece , when it 's income and pensions are 2x/3x higher than ours '' - average citizen . 
  we have gr\u016bto parkas for that , you 're more than welcome to visit it, 
  what do you think about removal of mikhail `` the hangman '' muravyov 's [ statue ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/%d0%9f%d0%b0%d0%bc%d1%8f%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%ba_%d0%9c%d1%83%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b2%d1%8c%d1%91%d0%b2%d1%83.jpg ) ? 
  `` locals should have been able to see something from the past every day in order not to forget '' harsh policies of russification by banning latin writing and lithuanian language , hangings of lithuanians and suppression of lithuanian and polish nationalism ? 
   also destroying everything you do n't like is a bit ... soviet , wo n't you agree ? 
  it only would be soviet if lithuanians destroyed historical statues in moscow , which is not the case here . 
  and like you said these statues are n't being destroyed . 
   but , in both cases , is n't it just an attempt to erase some history ? 
  gr\u016bto parkas is a perfect place for preserving history . 
  soviet nostalgists are already pissed ( those who were born in the 60s ) , even though those statues are in a horrible condition and no one in the right mind would try to fix them . 
  good riddance i say .
