  mayor should gift them to gr\u016bto parkas . 
  [ or cue the video where putin has gay fever ] ( https://youtu.be/b1d7llx4rm8 ), 
  no , this is russia . 
  would n't it be simpler just to organize summer camps to do that ? 
  we lithuania ns really love lithuania , fellow lithuania n. and that 's a good thing . 
  fellow lithuania n from lithuania ,, 
  that 's a jerktrain ? 
  it gets funnier when you try to make sense of it and it sounds like a polandball comic : lithuania : lithuania . 
  greece . 
  russia want europe . 
  why lithuanian countries referendum ? 
  fuck eu , need country . 
  look mean - pretty gay . 
  european way - where always guess . 
  work better !, 
  baltic reason : money , world . 
  least latvia day bad ... 
  right , support estonia . 
  sad german question : end already guy ? 
  man , million vote . 
  shit , thank problem . 
  call must give against eastern down . 
  tell word years again since . 
  please , last poland pay great sweden . 
  jogaila thought nato . 
  example went matter . 
  debt union live . 
  happen language . 
  little take . 
  come . 
  seems cool . 
  someone believe point bit . 
  russian let illegal . 
  oh , russians taxes kids ? 
  join belarus !, 
  western germany - best . 
  you are asking the wrong question . 
  you must help italy because of european solidarity . 
  the questions you should be asking is `` why italy takes in refugees from a different continent and why europe has to solve other continent 's problems once again ? 
  what poland can do to help italy with current refugees and how to prevent even more from coming ? 
   it fascinates me that they send millions of people to work in western europe nobody sends anybody , people emmigrate on their own . 
   essentially exporting their unemployment except unemployment and brain drain rises in those countries since working age people leave . 
  you 're benefiting from those migrants more than anything . 
  very close !, 
  * [ exercises like this ] ( https://youtu.be/xd3dm2iumc8 ), 
  for some reason ukraine 's gass debt was n't a problem to gazprom until euromaidan . 
  but only lithuania is participating in that exercise . 
  i 'm suprised how sometimes people lack will to search information about something . 
  he 's probably an angsty teenager having a hard time dealing with his sexual orientation . 
  [ lithuanian version ] ( https://youtu.be/mgcbfmznn6o ) makes me feel very patriotic towards eu . 
  well , the article `` will greece fall into moscow 's embrace ? '', 
  was about greece potentially getting a loan from russia ... 
  what has my country to do with russia in this thread ? 
  i thought he was speaking danish at first , but then i realized he was actually speaking drunk-english . 
  lithuanian media : * `` why lithuania has to pay for greece ? 
  '' , * `` greece is trojan horse '' , * `` greece - at the edge of the abyss : soon it will have to pick up last pennies '' , * `` greece wants others to pay for it 's feasts '' * `` will greece fall into moscow 's embrace ? 
  '' , * `` greece acted irresponsibly '' , * `` weighed down in debt greece has the most generous pension system in the eu '' , * `` greece must live within its means '' , * `` greece promotes disastrous mood '' 10/10 for dramatic headlines and creativity . 
  and not go out without their father or brother too ? 
  yeah fuck those homosexuals living in eastern europe , why did their countries had to accept eu 's laws regarding equality and discrimination and make their lives better and promote tolerance . 
  it was clearly a mistake . 
  should have left them in russia 's influence zone and ban homosexual propaganda . 
   also , lithuania wtf ? 
  i believe that countries are influenced by their neighbours . 
  see our big neighbours poland , russia and belarus . 
  not exactly gay friendly countries . 
  now look at latvia , it 's surounded by lithuania , belarus , russia and estonia - the last one being the least homophobic baltic state and so latvia is less homophobic than lithuania . 
  take a look at estonia , it 's neighbours are russia , latvia and finland - last one being super gay friendly in the region , that 's why estonia is more tolerant than latvia and lithuania . 
  i believe if lithuania , for example , was located between norway and sweden it would be as gay friendly as they are . 
  it 's just something i thought of by just looking at the map . 
  the eastern you travel through former soviet states the more backwards it gets . 
  i use words like : awkward ; random ; whatever ; no problem ; ciao ; baguette ( instead of using unnecessary long lithuanian name for it `` pranc\u016bzi\u0161kas batonas '' ) ; lithuanized version of the german word `` bi\u00dfchen '' - bi\u0161ki , which means `` a little '' ; sveiks ( or lithuanian variation - sveikas ) which is `` hello '' in latvian ; once in a while swear words like `` kurwa '' , `` fuck '' , `` suka '' ( whore in russian ) , `` damn '' .

   good , and ( and fyi i am a vegetarian ) way to live up to the stereotype, 
   khodorkovsky or yevtushenkov , or sergei polonsk none of them are in prison, 
  except that the nazi swastika is not widespread and banned by law . 
  except that sources prove nothing and `` proofs '' are not even from reputable sources . 
   http://old.kurier.lt/?r=11&amp;a=4632 http://defendinghistory.com/swastikas http://www.anorak.co.uk/250900/the-consumer/lithuania-labels-exported-food-with-official-swastika-marketing-fail.html/ nazi and soviet symbols are banned in lithuania . 
  the last link you provided was the only one with actual nazi symbol on stickers which were put on lithuanian products exported to russia by russian youth organisation - nashi . 
  so i 'm deeply concerned about open glorification of fascism by russia . 
  he 's a religious figure in islam too, 
  we have been exposed . 
  shut it down . 
   your 14 powerful portraits of men expressing their feelings towards conscription service proved to be really powerful , but perhaps not in a way you envisioned . 
  indeed it was , the point of those photos were to show that going to military is n't a thing that defines `` manliness '' . 
  those photos of 14 hipsters crying was a reaction to commentators calling men who do n't want to go do military service `` sissy '' , `` pussy '' and `` non men '' . 
  `` you 're asking why these men are crying ? 
  why should n't they ? 
  we would like to emphasize that sensitivity , gentleness , emotionality , pacifism are properties that are suitable for both women and men . 
  for these qualities a person can not be condemned , just like he should n't be for his choices and opinion . '',

  act like a ** holes . 
  simple , say the house defended itself . 
  the only common ancestor of baltic and slavic languages if one existed was proto-indo-european language . 
  baltic and slavic languages are grouped together because of few loan words and certain common inovations that they developed by being in contact with each other . 
  this is amazing, 
  the origins of the name belarus ( white russia ) is unclear .
