  looking at you , dear women   close proximity to the infamous english word yeah , but imo names of certain 2 countries in africa sound wayyy closer, 
  it is just that the term `` juodaodis '' does n't carry any offensive connotation . 
  even the `` negras '' used to be / ( still is ? ), 
  not meant as an insult , just another short simple word to call the black skinned people . 
  there are plenty of derogatory terms , however . 
  dear foreigners , on behalf of my fellow lithuanians , who do n't know that certain n-words are considered slurs elsewhere , please do n't take offense if you hear yourself being called a `` negras '' [ neh-ghras ] . 
  that should signal sincere curiosity . 
  but if you hear a `` nigeris '' - punch the fucker in the mouth . 
  best wishes !, 
  damn , estonia , you beat us again !, 
  you managed to rustle so many jimmies ... 
  he did . 
  but he said it as lithuanian words . 
  while our prime minister 's speech was a bit cringey , but also somewhat lighthearted and funny , this one , called [ toxic files ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_hwkt2juu ) is a real cringe-jewel . 
  i always thought it was 2013 , but he pronounced it as `` septyn '' . 
  also could 've been a brain fart , as was in man-mantifesooo, 
  i am satan that he was given a text , where all the english words were rewritten in lithuanian letters and sounds . 
  not only that , the words were made to correspond to actual lithuanian words , which is even more funny . 
  i have no other explanation why one would say '' \u0161aud\u0117 tu \u0161aud\u0117 '' - these are pure lithuanian words and mean '' ( they ) have been shooting , you , ( they ) have been shooting '' . 
   is like , if during russian empire we would insist to everyone to learn russian , and only russian to be the state language of all regions ... oh , wait ... we did that . 
  but we are still hated for that yeah . . we do n't hunt polish book smugglers nowadays though . 
  on a serious note , i do n't think lithuania oppresses poles regarding their language and heritage , there are schools and stuff . 
  but you would agree that it would be strange if you went to a public facility in moscow , say , a library , and you would be served ( if one can use that word ) by a lithuanian in lithuanian language . 
  ah , yes , you are right . 
  still , ~ 75 ( or 25 , if only count from the independence ) years is plenty to learn the state language . 
  if my family lived in poland , say punsk , for three generations already , i 'd speak perfect polish . 
  vilnius is much more a part of lithuania historically than crimea will ever be to russia . 
  i honestly do n't know how to answer that from a serious political point of view . 
  i can only say my personal opinion , however unacceptable for some it may be - if were to move to poland or any other country , it would be expected of me to adapt to local culture , to adhere to local laws , to speak local language and ** not the other way around ** . 
  i do n't understand people , who leave their countries because they do n't like living in them , then they come to another country and inside it they start `` building '' a small version of their home country , which was the thing they were trying to get away from . 
  poland is a whole ` nother thing . 
  the biggest issue with polish people in lithuania would be the same problem with the state language . 
  like when someone tried to buy a ticket at a kiosk in vilnius and got a `` nie m\u00f3wi\u0119 po litewsku '' . 
  also it is very sad that a certain politician tries to gather popularity among polish minority by making up problems that are ... unnecessary ? 
  like with those polish letters in passports , street labeling etc. 
  so he stirs up such problems ( `` problems '' - imo ) , then polish minority thinks - `` hey , we * are * oppressed ! '', 
  and thus begins the separation of ethnic communities , tensions and whatnot . 
  that said , i think very highly of poland and polish people . 
  we had a great past , and though there were some rough patches , we are very close and i believe our nations should have much better relations . 
  we share basically the same culture . 
  while latvia will always be our `` bros 4 life '' , i think that poland is the next best thing ( tied with estonia , perhaps  ) . 
  thank you . 
  i should have also mentioned the drinking culture and the general `` mne poch '' ( idgaf ) attitude , but that really depends on a situation , let alone personal preferences . 
  to sum up - `` one does not simply comprehend russia '' . 
  ethnic lithuanian here . 
  there are a lot of different things about russia and russian people that i extremely like , or extremely dislike , i 'll try to list some of my * personal * thoughts . 
  russian classic culture and arts - ** cool ** . 
  russian modern music - ** not cool ** . 
  the past relations between lithuania and russia as countries - ** not cool ** . 
  the modern relations - ** still not cool ** . 
  ethnic russians in lithuania , who are educated and can speak the language of the state - ** cool ** . 
  ethnic russians who , despite living in lithuania for 50 years , did n't bother to learn decent lithuanian language - ** not cool ** . 
  the ones who answer arrogantly in russian language on purpose if you asked them something in lithuanian - ** even worse ** . 
  russian official language - ** cool ** . 
  russian unofficial language `` the mat ' '' , where you can construct comprehensible sentences using only 3-story swearwords - ** the fucking best ** . 
  russian people , who do n't harbor undeserved animosity towards the baltics and generally do n't act as dicks - ** cool ** . 
  russian people , who think that the baltics are somehow still in the wrong ( even though , you know , occupation ) and view us as enemies - ** facepalm ** . 
  not only that . 
  many of my friend couples ( ~ 27-30 years old ) are unable to have kids even if they want to . 
  infertility is a problem now . 
  a subsidized fertility healthcare would definitely help . 
  yes , yes i know , adoption . 
  however this is not for everyone , and honestly , not an answer to declining demographics . 
  i 'm proud for you , br\u0101\u013ci !, 
  to make oneself covered in dishwater ? 
  you know , you can gently press the brake pedal for only the brake lights to come on and no actual braking . 
  should make the asshole hit the brakes immediately , thus giving you some space . 
  open a brothel ? 
  and lithuanians would do what exactly in that joint team ? 
  fetch towels ? 
  our football team once lost to the training cones !, 
  or maybe ussr did not murder/exile to siberia people of all ex-ussr on the same scale ? 
  yeah , ussr fucked over a lot of countries , but only poland and the baltics have the audacity to actually point that out !, 
  some bunch of ungrateful cunts , amirite ? 
  * woop woop * - it 's the sharia police !, 
  do this !, 
  well ... 
  i wonder how each european country would stereotype japan . . 
  i believe that at least 60 % would be `` tentacle porn '' . 
  why the dothraki guy is not wielding an arakh ? 
  i , for one , like eurovision and i always look forward to romanian performances . 
  dat countertenor dubstep dracula ... 
   westophobic occidentophobic, 
  * similia similibis curantur * only applies for people who drink alcohol when they are hungover . 
   just do n't go to asocial family apartment for drink and you are safe . 
  or drug addict dens , roma camps ... common sense , really . 
  whereas in western europe people get blown up or shot in metro stations , airports , concerts , cafes in broad daylight . 
  you have a * car * ? 
  you bourgeois !, 
  high murder rates come from antisocial families in rural areas , who murder their co-drinkers or cohabitants in drunken stupor . 
  cities are safer than in western europe , especially lately . 
  oh , i think the internet is pretty aware of [ moldova ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxopviu98xo ), 
  ... drinking wine from the skull of ~ ~ jeor ~ ~ nikephoros fucking ~ ~ mormont ~ ~ genikos . 
  do you wear [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ribbon_of_saint_george ) ? 
  could you please think of anything new instead of the old `` flowers and carry away '' ? 
  lithuania - effective suicides, 
  happy what ? 
  tifu by leaving my ak rifle and a handcuffed mentally challenged criminal alone in my police cruiser . 
  that sounds like being in a ninja clan . 
  thank you , romania , for the manele !,
