  most of the poles in lithuania ca n't talk and understand the polish language . 
  they talk in some sort of mixed language ( russian , belorussian , polish ) , its not an accent . 
  i can bet that neither poland nor baltics would n't want to be part of `` great '' russian macronation again . 
  sorry russia , but we do n't want to be part of your `` great '' macronation . 
  i would choose a macronation with baltics ( latvia , estonia , lithuania ) + poland . 
  without usa baltic states would be annexed in a few days . 
  in late 2010 , vladimir putin signed a plan to move the russian federation government towards free software including linux in the second quarter of 2012, 
  information from vikipedia . 
  only politics tries to create tension , to increase their popularity . 
  modern lithuanian minority in poland is composed of 5,639 people according to the polish census of 2002 , with most of them ( 5,097 ) living in the podlaskie voivodeship ( suwa\u0142ki region ) , particularly in gmina pu\u0144sk where they form a majority ( 74.4 % of population ) . 
  there are lithuanian publications ( over 80 books have been published , and there are several magazines , of which the largest is `` au\u0161ra '' ( = `` dawn '' ) , co-sponsored by polish ministry of internal affairs ) . 
  lithuanian organizations are involved in organizing cultural life of the minority ( with libraries , choirs , theatres , etc. ) . 
  there are also lithuanian-language programmes on local radio bia\u0142ystok and telewizja bia\u0142ystok . 
  there are several lithuanian cultural organizations in poland . 
  various lithuanian cultural activities include the lithuanian meeting ( zlot ) in pszczelnik , and the lithuanian musical festival s\u0105skrydis . 
  in 2006 the lithuanian minority received 1.344.912 zlotys ( ~ $ 450,000 ) from polish government in 2006 ( 22 out of 27 requests were approved ), 
  totally b-s . 
  the lithuania minority in poland is integrated to polish society . 
  they all speaks and writes in polish and do n't have any nationalistic ideas . 
  totally agree with you . 
  have many polish friends - no tension . 
  akcja wyborcza polak\u00f3w na litwie ( awpl ) and his leader tomasevski creates tension , and this party is the most pro-russian party in lithuania . 
  ca n't understand why polish government ca n't see this and still works with him . 
  yeah . 
  its the same situation like boris nemtsov . 
  just to get some attention . 
  misleading title . 
  it should be `` contraband cigarettes are burning greece 's finances '' . 
   russian city that has become part of lithuania which city are you from ? 
  which russian city has become part of litihuania ? 
  i could bet that half of the children are 25 years old males without passport . 
  in lithuania every cashier has a gadget that can detect is it real money or counterfeit . 
  and every banknote bigger than 5 euro will be checked in bigger supermarkets and shops . 
  living in euro zone . 
  500 euro banknote is a mistery for me . 
  havent seen it , 
  upvote for midget czar . 
  we are waiting sweden in this club . 
  germany should start strengthen military cooperation with baltic . 
  if russia will put boots on baltic ground , there will be no nato . 
  according this site www.socdarbas.lt the wage for social workers after taxes is 350,74 eur, 
  wrong . 
  social worker assistant with higher education in ukmerg\u0117 gets 397 before taxes.ant you get 394 if you do n't have a higher education . 
  social workers assistant wage is 397 euro before taxes . 
  a little bit higher than minimum wage . 
  and you get this wage only if you have a higher education . 
  even if u think that this is silly article , this war is not a rebellion . 
  it 's a real war between fascist russia and ukraine, 
  if police ca n't control 1,5 million immigrants , goverment should do something about that . 
  for example : send them back . 
  huge islamic state, 
  i ca n't understand why police ca n't do anything about this situation . 
  the camera is on , so its easy to investigate the crime . 
  that immigrant tried to strangle that man . 
  according interactive live map russians attacking everyday . 
  http://liveuamap.com/ 66 ceasefire violations by militants yesterday, 
  take my upvote for a random cat, 
  they were already safe in turkey . 
  how can they be asylum seekers in calais ? 
  totally agree with you, 
  just one word - russia, 
  refugees or illegal immigrants ? 
  and its third time then germany is responsible for destroying europe . 
  why should n't they ? 
  its satire . 
  satire is usually meant to be humorous , its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism , using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society . 
  its just a fact that red army did raped many people . 
  both sides ( soviets and nazis ) are horrible , just that soviets win does n't make them right , they just get unpunished with those things that they done . 
  wel . . sweetjones1 is right.red army in ww2 had made a lot of crimes againts women . 
  there was even a sculpture in poland to show how horrible it was http://cdn4.spiegel.de/images/image-557547-breitwandaufmacher-irif-557547.jpg, 
  loreta asanavi\u010ci\u016at\u0116 ( 22/04/1967 -- 13/01/1991 ) on 12 -- 13 january 1991 , she was on guard at the tv tower in vilnius . 
  loreta asanavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 went there together with her namesake friend loreta tru\u010dilauskait\u0117 . 
  both of them worked at the amalgamation dovana . 
  at about 11 p.m. loreta called her mother and promised her to return home . 
  according to her friend , they were holding hands . 
  loreta asanavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 screamed , `` i am afraid . '' her friend suggested kneeling down and praying , but the tank was already heading towards them . 
  three women -- both loretas and angel\u0117 pladyt\u0117 -- found themselves under the tank ; however , loreta asanavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 was most severely wounded ... she was taken to hospital still alive and had hopes to survive . 
  she passed away when she was twenty-two . 
  there are enough voluntaries for military service in lithuania . 
  do n't worry . 
  well , this morning we put the lights out and lit some candles in my workplace , to remember those who have died . 
  help from poland was bigger than humanitarian aid . 
  your comment made my eyes wet . 
  i have n't seen this photo before today so i doubt its from lithuania . . but according author its from january 13th http://www.getty-images.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-photo-taken-on-january-13-a-lithuanian-demonstrator-news-photo/119265386, 
  the idea that tank can move any moment forward is frightening and they still tried to push it . 
  40 tons of steel and brutal force against people who were wiling to sacrifice to defend their freedom . 
  a group of lithuanians attempt to stop a soviet tank from crushing a fellow protester during the assault on the television station in vilnius http://i.imgur.com/apqnuwo.jpg [ nsfw ], 
  the iron curtain has n't fallen , it just moved to the east .

  i know what deterrence means . 
  russia is the agressor and nato is simply trying to awoid russian attack . 
  and still . . there are some people who says that nato is the agressor . 
  lithuanian is so red that i dont even know that does r&d means . 
  more than 200000 have disapeared in this war . 
  strange things . 
  all europe and part of the world put sanctions on russia to support ukraine and now ukraine did not renew sanctions .

  they are ready to defend, 
  in the background in this coin there is vilnius cathedral with statues on the roof http://imgur.com/a/cuk1p funny thing that soviets destroyed those statues in 1950 and now they put them on the coin . 
  celebrating occupation of other countries .
