it was partly polish and german , same klaip\u0117da and other regions that were near weimar republic borders . 
  russia has 0 history with kaliningrad , actually it erased more than 800 years long history of that region . 
  kaliningrad region is one of the most artificial regions ever and evidence of insane russification and ethnic cleansing . 
  while poland shares history with gdansk . 
  why \u0141 and not w ? 
  what 's the bloody difference between those two ? 
  that sounds so strange , poland y u no easy language ? 
  lietuva , best name ever !, 
  if estonians removed their `` th '' we can do it too . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  in lithuanian it 's \u010cekija , so it 's perfectly fine for us to pronounce . 
  only if you pronounce `` e '' as in english . 
  you need also to annex klaip\u0117da / memelland region , that was the last piece before invasion of poland .

  you 're [ one freaky ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noys6lqed7i#t=1m9s ) guy . 
  senpai noticed us !, 
  god dammit , they took over england !, 
  skinny women are best , sorry . 
  got ta get the winged hussar kit from my basement i guess , have n't used it in a while . 
  well [ aivaras abromavi\u010dius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aivaras_abromavi\u010dius ) is ukraine 's minister of economy and trade , but he announced his resignation on 3 february 2016 . 
  even though he was one of the few that did care about ukraine . 
  beautiful . 
   influenced by germans does n't really mean `` like germany '' . 
  the baltic germans still were a distinct group of germans and comparing the situation in medieval livonia to that of germany is a gross over-generalization . 
  and yet you try to compare it with nordics ? 
   and poles more than swedes or danes ? 
  really ? 
  that really shows how little you know about estonia . 
  when talking about polish influence i meant latvia , more specifically their region of latgale which is roman catholic . 
  i do n't understand what kind of relevant mark denmark or sweden left . 
   catholic lithuania with a long history of little contacts with the nordic countries , having been under swedish rule for a very short time ... 
  i think not ... yeah maybe because we were fighting teutonic order to which knights of hre , kingdom of sweden , denmark , norway etc came ? 
  we fought in polish-swedish war , if not internal matters we would have taken all of livonia after [ battle of kircholm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ) , we had many wars against sweden , we almost broke from polish-lithuanian union and made [ swedish-lithuanian union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) . 
  we have as much history with sweden if not more than you do , you were just occupied battlefield and that 's all . 
  that still does n't explain why we should not be in nato and why we would n't want to see usa 's hegemony . 
   however both estonia and latvia should be considered northern europe . 
  how so , both of you were influenced by germans , poles a lot more than swedes or any other nordic country , lithuania is as much northern as you are . 
  shut up and go back to dungeon . 
  english is already a must learn secondary language , you can keep native + english , good enough , no need to add more lingua franca . 
  what kind of bs are you talking about , it made literally 0 sense . 
   '' [ little fascist pribaltika are preparing for invasion of russia ... ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/3/35/country-balls-parenting.png/revision/latest?cb=20151024124902 ) '' this is literally what putin 's propaganda show these days . 
  how is it a mistake ? 
  when it keeps kremlin claws at bay from us . 
  tell what you want but for us nato and usa 's military hegemony is best thing . 
  i rather have that nordic flag , looks nice . 
   the other was kind of mixed . 
  that 's what you get after just over 400 years of close ties . 
  yeah , pilsudski was kind of mix though his last name points out that he belonged to a lithuanian noble family who dates back to pagan times ( xiii c. )  j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski , the most important polish political leader of the interwar period , often pointed to his lithuanian ancestry , and hoped to recreate the old commonwealth that 's why such thing as [ polish-lithuanian identity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) exists . 
  it 's neither polish , nor lithuanian , it 's polish-lithuanian . 
  why the fuck are we in eastern europe and estonia is n't , that 's fucking bias . 
  good , that means he will not have any power . 
  you can call him [ polish-lithuanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) . 
  i gon na cosplay noble , incest is good ? 
  it 's people of states that were under ussr . 
  i bet he also feels like he is not wearing anything at all ... 
  so he 's american ? 
  banging bears , kinky and gross . 
  lithuanian looks like oldest brother of all three , as it should be . 
  my family members died fighting red army in aftermath of ww2 , so please fuck off, 
  it 's inevitable . 
  well all you need is to dream about swedish-lithuania union then . 
  yes you 're right , you once were our slaves instead of german , russian , swedish , danish and that 's all . 
  lithuania borders [ russia to west ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaliningrad_oblast#/media/file:kaliningrad_in_russia.svg ) also . 
  too bad russians destroyed all of that region history . 
  do n't stop , listening to [ sabaton ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zgkysbtuiw#t=41s ) in swedish in far more epic than in english . 
  western europe . 
  he 's british , but also he 's european whether you like it or not . 
  stop complaining and accept forth rei ... european dream !, 
   lol bias . 
  ukraine , georgia , moldova all not getting eu or nato membership because of russia . 
  i 'm sure many millions of russians are living nice lives , even in economic difficulty . 
  great control , creating war in your neighbour which will prevent it from ever being ally of yours or at least friendly towards you , it will boost up people wanting to join nato and eu if it will ever be possible , what a joke , not a strategy to hold power . 
   ok , you 're clearly set in your ways . 
  csto is essentially a russia dominated alliance , and it 's as credible as nato . 
  the eeu is only a few years old , so of course it 's `` next to nothing compared to the eu '' . 
  not difficult to grasp . 
  csto : russia and few non-relevant states , no offence to those countries though . 
  nato : few non-relevant states like mine and then few great powers , and of course a super power . 
  how does in your eyes csto is credible as nato ? 
  the only thing comes close is nukes which are from russia yet again , nothing more . 
   china 's economy has seen big problems in the past year , a few stock market crashes . 
  but sure china stronk russia weak . 
  china is seen as next supwerpower which russia is not even close to becoming . 
   except that 's very unlikely to happen . 
  and their economy is very far from bankruptcy . 
  so continue to believe your own lies . 
  i never said it will come next year , it will take time if russia continues it 's retarded ways of foreign policy . 
   italy ? 
  oh that country who has no unsc permanent membership ? 
  the non-nuclear , small military nation ? 
  with very little influence worldwide ? 
  regardless , russia is still as likely as the uk , or germany , or france , to become bankrupt . 
  `` unsc permanent membership '' was obtained by ussr , who was second superpower , not russia , ukraine , belarus should get one as well since together with russia they created ussr . 
  if we 're going compare military , we might as well compare economy . 
  uk 's economy out weights russia 's economy almost twice ... and where do you see russian influence world wide ? 
  out side supporting some dictator in syria they got nothing .
