  but it 's really complicated when you think about those times . 
   largest , strongest , but also simultaniously most progressive and tolerant countries in europe ? 
  grand duchy of lithuania , ruthenia and samogitia was as much tolerant country as commonwealth for your information . 
  no language , religion or any ethnicity was repressed . 
  while in commonwealth times poles actually oppressed non-catholic lands . 
  i still do n't know how to feel about those times . 
  temporary capital *, 
  a bit more right side . 
  it just looks like lithuanian flag . 
  is that lithuanian flag at middle bottom right ? 
  pretty much [ your language ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloossfu6cm ) to us . 
  lithuanian borders changed drastically through time . 
  so no . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teutonic_order#/media/file:teutonic_order_1260.png ) ;[ [ 2 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuania#/media/file:lithuaniahistory.png ), 
  do n't forget , about how they might learn to open doors !, 
  that 's why we look up you , nordics best countries . 
  unity of baltic states happened after ww1 . 
  not after ussr fell . 
  two words - intewar period :\\ ^ ), 
  it 's good time to be alive . 
  time changes so fast . 
  til , we have a dispute with latvia . 
  imagine how much europe would be far richer if soviets did n't take half of it . 
  this is in memory of christianity , basketball is our new and true religion . 
  kill every teuton scum , they took our brothers !, 
  for memory of old prussians !, 
  but we balts genetically are close to fins and you , why we are not welcome ? 
  have you seen their speed of their internet ? 
  americans can only dream about it . 
  only after deluge we started lose our status as great power . 
  when what was your point in comment you made before ? 
  it felt like you got offended that we have cultural similarities with them . 
   ** culturally similar ** do you even read the question i was answering . 
  yeah i know [ that one ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/7/7e/forgiveness.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141229191429 ) . 
  well at that time we were `` unified '' with ruthenia and only then with poland . 
  i 'll try to make it short . 
  estonia and latvia were occupied by [ livonian brothers of the sword ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_brothers_of_the_sword#/media/file:medieval_livonia_1260.svg ) as part of northern crusades , we manage to defend ourselves and [ stay independent ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png ) , after battle of saule `` lbs '' was too weak and became just a branch of teutonic order who occupied old prussian ( balts ) land and assimilated them through centuries into german prussians that was later main force in unifying germany . 
  as we took independent path we were main enemy for to as they were to us . 
  the moment they started to attack not only pagan lands but also catholic that belonged to poland ( ironic because polish duke invited them to deal with pagan balts ) we both had a common enemy , bla bla bla our alliance grew stronger and stronger , adopted catholicism , personal unions happened we beat to to dust and transform them into duchy of prussia , real union happened , became major power in europe until last partition of commonwealth ( 1795 ) . 
  while meantime all that time modern estonia and latvia were battlefields between swedish , russian and polish-lithuanian forces . 
  they became protestant lutheran while we stayed catholics . 
  our building structures differs , since they were more influenced by german elite , while we had more influence from polish side . 
  the only thing that comes close is that were under russian empire , had same foreign policy after ww1 , were occupied by ussr since 1940 and now have same foreign policy again after fall of ussr . 
  also latvia and lithuanians belong to baltic language group , while estonians do n't . 
  one day lithuania might cheat on latvia with poland . 
  we are , since ww1 ended . 
  before that we took different paths in history . 
  check them in order to understand why . 
  i doubt we would want that . 
  cuisine , some words , etc. 
  there was a reason [ polish-lithuanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) identity existed . 
  well we 're mix of pagans and catholics . 
   no other nations got friendship is magic rhyme :(, 
  can confirm . 
  actually 3v2 . 
  plus only polish army was in battle our was still somewhere in moravia ( today 's slovakia ) . 
  and numbers do n't mean anything , but how you use them ( see second link ;p ) . 
  ^ ^ pst let 's ~ ~ invade ~ ~ vacation on belarus together , what will you say ? 
  i knew about it though . 
  since we hate sh * t out of communism and anything that resembles it , red star is literally red skull to me . 
  they 're wearing stars tho on their cap . 
  but you can into grand duchy-philia :p, 
  to what ? 
  you 're west asians genetically . 
   to all the `` europeans '' , see you in the next siege !, 
  `` if [ god ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna ) is with us , then who is [ against us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ) . '', 
  because all those super-states were enforced , not voluntary , like eu is . 
  you know nothing , jon snow . 
  koreans would fall out of their feet if they tasted pure european beer . 
  not all koreans do plastic surgery you know . 
  a micro-state that is common in europe ... 
  i meant sound when talking . 
  could be , since we 're [ baltai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) . 
  ^ ^ balt-as ( lt ) / - s ( lv ) -  white/pure, 
  i would take swedish and french . 
  my ears just love the way of spelling in those languages . 
  even bulba can into spying . 
  if only kremlin did actually same to estonians and poles , would be great . 
  a bit ironic if you ask me , being last pagan state in europe to convert to christianity and then taking nr . 
  1 spot on most beautiful christian churches . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mnoojti.png ) is something that will confirm your words . 
  well you help to keep stability in europe . 
  thank you < 3, 
  you 're already remembered as lechs ( lenkija ) in our minds . 
  pass me some too . 
  you ca n't deny that ussr only existed because of terror and iron fist - [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) ;[ [ 2 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) ;[ [ 3 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania \\ ) ) . 
  so yes , usa being far better at cold war helped to finally break prison of nations . 
  i hate word `` expansion '' to me it sounds like nato came , placed their flag on our soil and said , you 're part of nato now . 
  yes , we manage to push for eu and nato while russia was still weak . 
  no regrets . 
  because it 's very beneficial economically and politically . 
  eu just wo n't fall , never , it can only evolve or re-create itself . 
  yeah but we had far older name for belarus before soviets forced into our dictionary `` baltarusija '' , anyway it was `` gudija '' . 
  fear us , russia !, 
   survived what ? 
  the mongols ? 
  name ... 
   tell that to the cubans . 
  they also thought they had the right to have soviet protection !, 
  nuclear missile protection ?
