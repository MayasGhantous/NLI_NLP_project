  do we have those in baltics ? 
  because i 'm pretty sure russia has it in kalinigrad ... 
  this is not some kind of game , this is real life , every nation goes for it 's interest , if russia does n't give a sh * t about our interest why should we ? 
   the term is now confined to slavic people from the carpathian region , i believe . 
  because they 're the ones that survived . 
  while rest split into white , red and black ruthenia . 
  it 's umbrella , but what old scores ? 
  we want to have as little as we can with russia , we want to be left alone and not bothered . 
  very irrelevant , it 's not up to them or russia to command what sides we should stick with . 
  elective king was king of poland and grand duke of lithuania . 
  ruthenians were pre-ukranians , belarusians and russians , they all were people of [ rus ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kievan_rus%27 ) and once spoke same language which was rus ' . 
  russia happened to be first to break apart from it and create independent states like grand principilty of moscovy and novgorod republic . 
  after conquring former rus ' lands from us and poles it renamed itself to what you know today russia . 
  to protect states like baltics or poland from potential aggression that russia possesses , georgia , ukraine are modern prime examples . 
   former u.s. 
  ambassador matlock disagrees with you . 
  how can you break something that does n't exist on paper ? 
   i claimed that lithuanians have a justification to see russia as an aggressor . 
  yeah i 'm kinda sleepy did n't read it right , so sorry . 
   oh , yes you did . 
  an empire is simply that above a kingdom . 
  the emperor is the sovereign above kings . 
  if you are the king of two kingdoms , you 're officially an emperor . 
  lithuania was not a kingdom before or after union . 
   you 're officially an emperor . 
  problem plc ruler was an elective king , not an emperor . 
   nato broke unwritten promises it made to the soviets at the end of the cold war . 
  the u.s. broke the promises it made during the cuban missile crisis . 
  we all know the promises that russia broke , but let 's not have too selective a memory and forget that russia has no monopoly on broken promises . 
  there were no promises to begin with . 
   of course , as a lithuanian you 've been conditioned all your life to think of russia as an aggressor , and not without justification , so i do n't expect to convince you of anything . 
  yeah russia being our adversary since xiv c. is not justifiable . 
  having to survive tries of russification in russian empire since 1795-1918 and then in ussr is not justifiable poles sat at moscow-kremlin , not lithuanians , our army was separate even after union . 
  we were fighting in polish-swedish war at that time . 
  besides we never had an empire , grand duchy of lithuania ( officially grand duchy of lithuania , ruthenia and samogitia ) was free to it 's people , no language , religion or ethnicity was suppressed , expansion was mostly through marriages with ruthenian princess , battles fought against teutonic order to the west and golden horde to the east . 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth was nobles republic , not an empire , gdl within plc territories retained same status quo , poles were oppressing non-catholic lands though . 
  so you imply eu and nato are demonic aggressive alliance who 's sole purpose is to invade russia who hold one of the biggest nuke arsenal . 
  what a joke . 
  great , now start insulting , real mature of you . 
  yes were pro-western since day 1 ... that does not mean we hate russia . 
  how does being pro-western is anti-russian ? 
  we kept cooperating with them , we only started to really move away from russian influence when ukrainian crisis started . 
  i 'm talking about nato members . 
   ukraine is big country for european standards poland is also big , so what ? 
   and hated russia - easy choice for you . 
  you 're delusional if you think we hate russia . 
  we hate kremlin , their oligarchs that ruined modern russia 's potential . 
   si deus nobiscum quis contra nos too much reminder of plc. 
   with shared history lithuania and poland has far longer history with ukraine than russia does . 
  what you 're saying ukraine must be kept as buffer state under russia 's pawn , instead of it being independent nation like it should be in first place after break of ussr . 
  the only difference is that we manage to take path far earlier than ukraine did . 
  ussr was not russia , first of all , just part of it . 
  ussr had different ideology , was dictatorship , country was held on terror and iron fist , [ illegally annexed baltic states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states#list_of_recognition_and_non-recognition_of_annexation ) , which was only recognized as de facto control but not de jure . 
  nato purpose was to protect other european countries from getting invaded by ussr , you really think they would want to see their adversary in nato that was destroying half of europe ? 
  ussr was held by terror and iron fist , russia 's ethnic divisions also are held by iron fist . 
  eu is not . 
  every nation can leave if it wants to , so eu disbanding is impossible task to do . 
  he 's already mad after ukraine has stop dancing by his flute . 
  yeah , we might be eunified superpower by that time . 
  :\\ ^ ) ** gott mit uns , as we all stand united !, 
  so literally just ditch nato and join [ csto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_security_treaty_organization ) . 
  who on earth would want that ? 
   in march 2009 , the polish foreign minister , rados\u0142aw sikorski , suggested including russia in nato . < ...  in march 2009 , the russian envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , in response to rados\u0142aw sikorski \u2032 s proposal , while not ruling out nato membership at some point in the future , was quoted as saying : `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . '', 
  it 's more likely that russia will fell than nato or eu will . 
  so it becomes very ironic to hear . 
  no , but we faced very similar course of action against our re-established independence . 
  [ why lithuanians feel ukraine 's pain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqfbkjnryn0 ) [ january events ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania \\ ) ) [ soviet omon assaults on lithuanian border posts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_omon_assaults_on_lithuanian_border_posts ) there were tries to create separatist territory around vilnius region when january events were happening but nobody supported it and it died same day it was proclaimed . 
  i guess having [ very low ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/russians_in_baltic_states_%282011%29.svg/800px-russians_in_baltic_states_%282011%29.svg.png ) russian minority helped . 
  we just took step to eu and nato while russia was still weak . 
  they still b * tch about it all the time since very first day of membership . 
  making even delusional offers , like lower gas price if we left nato . 
  but baltics did join nato even though we 're sharing border with russia , and what russia did ? 
  nothing . 
  thank god it fell . 
  he 's just jelly of us . 
  hehehe . 
  every ship gets a name . 
  at least we 're not swede . 
  * bro firsting * with denmark . 
   dnieper damn you [ invaders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts#/media/file:east_europe_3-4cc.png ) !, 
  how is that `` good old days '' ? 
  and do you really think rest of the world was any different ? 
  [ germanic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/europe_germanic-languages_2.png/800px-europe_germanic-languages_2.png ) *, 
  interesting that there is both baltic and aesti on the map . 
  [ aesti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aesti ) :  geographical and linguistic evidence suggests that the aesti were , ethnologically , a baltic people < ...  tacitus almost certainly erred in implying that the aesti were a hybrid celtic-germanic culture ... 
  [ erm ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1vddfrt.png ) you should not have suppose to know this !, 
  first you need to become european . 
  :\\ ^ ) start breeding with greeks and give birth to byzantium . 
  russia has no influence anymore after many lng terminals opened in european countries . 
  he 's talking about rest of europe . 
  actually we expanded not by wars , but by marriages with princess of ruthenian principalities who wanted to escape mongol rule . 
  most notable battle [ battle of blue waters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_blue_waters ) secured most of kievan rus ' to us . 
  oh no you did n't !, 
  prepare for partitions !, 
  sorry lenkija , we done that with you , we do n't want you anymore . 
  unless you promise you wo n't bite our leg off . 
  are you really that dumb or just trolling ? 
  honestly ? 
  reason why our king christianized was to stop invasion because it was teutonic task `` to convert heretic lands to our divine god '' , which they did n't stop because their actual task at those times were to conquer as much land as possible , why do you think they would start invading polish lands also ?
