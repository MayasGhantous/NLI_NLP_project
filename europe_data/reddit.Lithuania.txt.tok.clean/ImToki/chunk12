  that was the reason why poland and lithuania made an alliance against teutonic order . 
  keeping on christianity meant to preserve power and independence against teutonic order . 
  after death of grand duke vyutautas the great we had one monarch ruling both states . 
  which happened to be from [ christian dynasty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casimir_iv_jagiellon ) that jogaila started . 
  you have no idea of lithuanian history do you ? 
  the moment our king christianized and teutonic order attacks did n't stop , all dukes become pagans again . 
  even after becoming a catholic , now king mindaugas did not cease sacrificing to his own pagan gods . 
  own lithuanian population did n't actually wanted to converted to christianity . 
  there is a reason we were last state to convert to christianity . 
  polish and lithuanian alliance and christianize of lithuania was result of teutonic order crusader invasions . 
  teutonic order invasions did n't stop till 1410 when battle of grunwald happened , which is far after christianization . 
   the lithuanian king ** turned to christianity ** to save his people from ** constant invasions **  hence they were n't ** christianized through an invasion ** what ... do you even read ? 
  sadly your leaders were quite incompetent at those times . 
  grand duchy of muscovy started to gain power after death of vytautas the great and w\u0142adys\u0142aw ii jagie\u0142\u0142o . 
  since we had only one monarch ruling over two states , attention given to eastern border was terrible and was clear sign for pre-russia to grow and eventually become second power who partitioned us . 
  and well even though sobieski was great military leader he saved third country that joined partitions . 
  at least we had heck of a ride in battles together . 
  b\u00f8rk + b\u00f6rk + perk\u016bnas + p\u0113rkons + perkele + kenadus = just imagine the possibilities !, 
  well actually we 're cool now , besides we really like you and rest of nordics , because you 're coolest region in europe and are big role models to us , plus your investment here is seen everywhere ( nordic banks , best banks !, 
  ^ ^ ^ swedbank ^ ^ ^ master ^ ^ ^ race , ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ tell ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ denmark . 
  state of 7 nations would be very hard task to do but nonetheless i support this idea nordic + baltic federation is our biggest dream . 
  `` intermarium '' idea was already in polish head since xx c. sadly it just made a * poof * when polish-lithuanian war started . 
  finland was actually conquered by swedish crusaders who after that convert them to christianity , that is same way livonian brothers of the sword converted modern latvia and estonia to christianity after conquering them . 
  i was defending word `` invasion '' by christianity on which you laughed . 
  they did fail but one of the reasons to christianize was to end their attacks on western lithuanian border , that did n't work out so christianity was quickly abandoned even though we were officially christian nation . 
  polish duke was the reason why northern crusades started by inviting teutonic order , why ? 
  because they could n't beat us - barbarians alone . 
  also latvia and estonia were christianized by sword instead of word . 
  agree , you little fucks killed our brothers - old prussians , so fuck your knights . 
  well lithuania is catholic but we were one of the last places ( lithuanian proper ) to christianize . 
  [ northern crusades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades ) were actually spread by sword instead of word . 
  they also can leave eu if they do n't want euro . 
  nobody is forcing anybody . 
  why do you fear euro so much ? 
  from what i know about my fathers past travel through russia in soviet times he said only moscow and saint petersburg were nice . 
  and bring them into putins dungeon ... 
  yes they 're obligated , but date for it does n't matter . 
  literally same . 
  though it is in feminine ( abi ) and masculine ( abu ) form . 
  `` abu '' also means `` both '' in lithuanian . 
  would n't that be `` abu tautu republika '' in latvian ? 
  unless you tried to write lithuanian one `` abiej\u0173 taut\u0173 respublika '' . 
  every empire was prison of nations . 
  lithuanian dukes , best dukes !, 
  for that you will need to form [ swedish-lithuanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) empire !!!, 
   meanwhile , others have concluded that the name of the island originates from the indo-european root * bhel meaning white , fair . 
  this root and its basic meaning were retained in both lithuanian ( as baltas ) and latvian ( as balts ) . 
  baltic sea confirmed to be owned by balts . 
  that 's the reason why i wrote this way . 
  just other way . 
  pretty much same . 
  also it - `` white '' means `` north '' , so yeah it 's ^ good ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ our ^ ^ ^ ^ propaganda . 
  we got ta start calling them by their true name - gudija . 
  i think ukraine would jump on it . 
  that 's more than half of ruthenia . 
  fun fact : queen jadwiga official title was king . 
  may i ask what does it mean ? 
  hehe , i got the catch . 
  as many said already regular populace called their country just `` rzeczpospolita '' . 
  can you expand on `` propaganda war '' when it comes to america-baltics ? 
  no need for tanks !, 
  just send our king to marry their queen !, 
  it 's an old name , used for your old tribe lechs , it just stayed that way . 
  hungarians , turks and few others also call you by lech tribe name . 
  ** edit : ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lechia, 
  i think you should used `` magnus ducatus lithuaniae '' . 
  what 's that ? 
  commonwealth ? 
  educated workforce ? 
  why would we need it ? 
  you 're in wrong subreddit . 
  kissing kremlin 's propagand-ass is located elsewhere . 
  even though nato would crush russian forces in every field , they have nukes which is more than enough to not take these kind of my words seriously . 
  so chill . 
  i find it hilarious when people say do n't poke the bear , when bear himself always poking everyone . 
  besides what bear could do ? 
  try to invade us and call for himself and rest of the world an annihilation ? 
  well yeah ... 
  the only place we could n't take was kremlin . 
  or just send poles or lithuanians ( aid by ukrainians and maybe even belarusians ( i hate this name , gudija true name of belarus ) ) , we know how to invade moscow . 
  if so we shall be named pagandom of lithuania !, 
  sabaton - wehrmacht , is still my favorite . 
   were they the victims of the time  or proud parts of lager goals ? 
   propaganda of the reich masterful machine, 
  well [ nazi germans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_german_ultimatum_to_lithuania ) and [ ussr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940_soviet_ultimatum_to_lithuania ) ultimatums were far more important before start of ww2 . 
  before that you will have to declare '' [ notice me senpai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_polish_ultimatum_to_lithuania ) '' ultimatum to us . 
  those people that go beyond greece do n't want to be register , they just want to cross borders and leech off welfare they would get in germany or nordic countries . 
  there are many articles already that economic migrants go back home after not getting what they expected . 
  first we need to control this flood then we can share of actual refugees . 
  and we 're taught oxford ( uk 's ) english here in lithuania . 
  if you really think i try to belittle americans you 're one sad person . 
  you 're too sensitive about it , get a chill pill , since you ca n't recognize a joke . 
   and actually most of the world now teaches their students in us english over uk english ** including many norther eu countries ** . 
  and you getting this from ? 
  i assume it has to do more with music , movie etc. 
  influence rather than school . 
   maybe they are legitimate refugees who just do n't want to live in a shit country ? 
  first place they come is greece or italy you know . 
  if they bypass that they 're not refugees anymore . 
   yeah , that explains why they are paying money to smugglers and take on a lift-threatening journey which they come from n. africa , from countries who have no war happening .
