  unless you 're saying being refugee in jordan or turkey is life threating also . 
  italy , greece , austria shit countries ? 
  you 're now talking non-sense . 
   which exactly ? 
  most of them do n't want to come here , why force them ? 
  stuff happening in w. europe is more than enough to know that bringing great chunks of those economic migrants will bring only problems ( living under rock lately ? ) . 
  we do n't care about their religion , lipka tatars lived in lithuania , poland and belarus since xiii c. when grand duke of lithuania invited them to fight in our army and gave them land for it . 
  you know every european union member pays to eu budget ? 
  though we happen to gain more from it . 
  european union is a project to make stable and rich europe so it 's in w. european mind to make sure e. europe is also rich . 
  if you think `` refugee '' crisis will destroy europe , you 're quite stupid , no point to even bring it to table . 
   why do people use `` economic migrant '' as such a pejorative ? 
  you ca n't call them refugees if :  they do n't want to come to poorer states  they bypass many safe countries it just screams that he 's economic migrant disguised as `` refugee '' . 
   any real qualifications beyond a high school education people like that do n't have money to migrate at all . 
  most migrants that from e. europe have skills in one or another field and they bring a lot in countries they migrate to . 
  i 'm surprised how can australian defend economic migrants when your government is the one who blocks them and from which we should learn how to deal with it . 
  why would we ? 
  they do n't want to come here , they bypass many safe countries , most of them do not escape war , but are economic migrants . 
  we speak traditional english ( uk ) , not simplified english ( usa ) :p, 
  there is no potential when it 's clear as day that attacking nato is suicide . 
  waste of time to keep conversation about it . 
  18 days acc , do n't bother . 
  one word , russophil or just plain stupid troll . 
  not for us though , they did a favor actually . 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ so ^ ^ sorry, 
  [ well ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_prussians ), 
  vilnius/wilno was catholic not orthodox , both poles and lithuanians are catholics . 
  what about lithuania ? 
  out side klaip\u0117da / memelland it never was protestant let alone orthodox , but rather catholic or pagan . 
  kielbasa ai n't tasteful . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ polish -- lithuanian ^ ^ ^ ^ war ^ ^ ^ ^ inc. . . 
  if lithuania would be send like this to poland , polish reaction would be \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 : gib, 
  right behind australia . 
  well it is our [ signature ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_lithuania ) to show our medieval past , glory that us and our fellow allies ( ruthenians , lipka tatars ) manage to bring to our land . 
  [ pretty much ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et7uvowt_1c ) ;d, 
  i think kremlin would consider that as an act of war and would wave with their nukes and threat of invasion even more . 
  lithuanian elites were bilingual very least , they spoke both lithuanian and ruthenian , after union of lublin it was fully replaced with polish in some parts ( most notable vilnius region ) . 
  plus in samogitia , many nobles never ceased to speak lithuanian natively . 
  i think the biggest argument we could have give is that city was always in possession of lithuania and always was used as multi-cultural place without any fears of oppression . 
  i think dispute over city was one of my and your nations mistake that was the only rotten place that poisoned in our relationship . 
  not really . 
  i meant you are going to become nordic without [ us coming ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) along !, 
   lithuania : fuck you because you 're the place i got the worst hangover of my life in . 
  there is a reason we 're on top by alcohol consumption , we have mastered art of drunkenness !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  we 're mad at polish government in interwar period for shredding [ treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suwa\u0142ki_agreement ) they signed , and staging [ mutiny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017beligowski%27s_mutiny#mutiny ) which meant no future alliances between poland and lithuania could ever be made . 
  [ traitor !, 
  ] ( http://lolworthy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/traitor-stormtrooper-gif.gif ), 
  yeah , today it 's a hot-on-air topic at the moment , about stopping to act as victim in ww2 and name nazi collaborators that are guilty of their crime , so do n't worry about that , my polish friend . 
  anyway do n't let this `` stuff happening in all of europe '' to forget our past glories and what we could have achieved if only we showed trust in each other . 
  well for our national identity is in golden age at the moment . . 
  nobody said they 're not poles ... wth :d, 
   please expand . 
  this is interesting . 
  polonised is actually [ legit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) argument . 
  you probably know j. pi\u0142sudski , polish hero that saved second polish republic from ussr claws . 
  and others like jogaila . 
   the family was polonized lithuanian nobility that over time became part of the polish nobility ( szlachta ) ; it has been called either a polish noble family or a polonized lithuanian noble family . 
  its most famous member was j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski , described variously as a pole or as polonized-lithuanian noble . 
   the pi\u0142sudskis date back to pagan times in lithuania and are recorded from the 13th century, 
  just give us the wheel , we always done better when we had the wheel !, 
  no , because my third language was french . 
  well actually most of them were polonised lithuanians , but they were poles no less . 
  before union of lublin , lithuanians were [ majority ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png/800px-lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png ) in those areas . 
  i think they came from so called `` troll factory '' . 
  oh trust me we would n't be hostile to that , because you know , russia . 
  but we would probably be skeptical about it but still it 's unlikely as we have a bit of cooperation going on . 
  i 'm pretty sure the longer time goes the more close we would feel to each other so eventually we would submit to as you said `` intermarium 2.0 '' . 
  yeah i guessed as much . 
  do n't worry , it 's only minority that does show hate towards poland , they are just much more vocal since they do n't know when to shut up . 
  i give up . 
  it sounds like english written in cyrillic and it 's painful to read . 
  never , ever read delfi.lt comments , it 's like yt , if you want aids you go there . 
  ;d sadly lithuanians do n't really have interest in commonwealth times , out side contested regions in interwar period people literally do n't even know we once had shared state . 
   a reasonably big fuck you goes to lithuania for talking shit about the commonwealth . 
  there were some misunderstandings and some mistakes were made , but we have paid for them no smaller price than you . 
  we have learned the lesson . 
  no reason to act all butthurt now . 
  in spite of everything , we still had a beautiful thing going there , man . 
  hello there !, 
  my bro , listen , nobody are even talking about commonwealth as it 's not promoted that much , our golden age was when vytautas the great reign over gdl because after his death g.d. of moscow grew stronger and stronger , it was n't just weak enemy anymore , it become a full rival . 
  on bright side we 're more than happy that you accept your mistake and we 're ready to forgive you < 3, 
  i hold grudge on poland for being [ mean and bossy in interwar period ] ( http://i.imgur.com/refhodn.jpg ) , if not that we could been bff like we were before year of 1795 . 
  now [ it breaks my heart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/usepsqn.png ) to see hungary and poland being bff while we 're forgotten like some kind man you used to have . 
  that 's why we consume a lot of alcohol now . 
  even google ' translate ca n't translate that . 
  potatoes first rage , how cute !, 
  since we do n't have any contested regions between each other anymore , i 'm pretty sure we could re-create commonwealth which is what you dreamed in interwar period ( nationalism from both sides ruined this idea ) . 
  we 're not so different in any sphere , out side language of course . 
  either way european nations will have to federalize to keep relevant status in the world stage , so this could only help to start it . 
  do you hate us ? 
  but latvia can not into blood !, 
  genocide and suppress of non-serbian population in kosovo was legal and approved by the un ? 
  last time i remember when we had wheel we defeated teutonic order and stuff , become great power and stuff and then you took wheel we got partitioned !, 
  so lithuania-poland-lithuania ? 
  only if this time it 's lithuania-poland , 
  true but nato , eu and also rest of nordics are one of the biggest reasons we 're less , and less liability . 
  new headline : russia forces withdraw from baltics as they 're getting slain by nato forces . 
  lenkija , please , not again . 
  eesti vikings are scary !,
