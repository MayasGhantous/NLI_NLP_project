  trying to trigger a lot of serbians , do n't you ? 
  oh please , totally lithuania 's fault for being occupied for half a century by a superpower who was oppressive dictatorship with idiotic ideology which was also forced onto us . 
  we totally wanted to be a burden for rest of europe , we totally do n't want to invest money we 're getting from eu , we totally want to remain shit-hole ... for god 's sake , we 're small country , who 's economy and own population was getting raped by foreign powers , more than 80 % of our gdp was stolen by soviet government . 
  we 're trying our best to climb to western european standards of living . 
  so , please , give us a break , will you ? 
  vytis ' casus belli been activated . 
  time for spirit of the `` grand duchy '' to force the `` united baltic duchy '' into existence . 
  making genocide is futile , the nato will stop you , submit or prepare for bombings . 
  it was created to counter ussr , now it 's here to counter russia , why else would ex-warsaw pact countries would leave it and join nato instead ? 
  nobody wants to be an ally with russia for historical and modern time reasons . 
  what next ? 
  we should let them do warfare practice on our soil ? 
  not a biggie , nothing bad will happen , right ? 
  and no they would n't do a return fire , if they enter our territory and start firing they 're literally declaring war on us and nato , since it 's nato planes that protect our air-space and our soil . 
  turkey is strategic point for usa , no way they would let it go . 
   ~ ~ turkey ~ ~ russia is ruled by minihitler ~ ~ erdogan ~ ~ putin who dreams of another ~ ~ osman ~ ~ russian empire authoritarian president in nutshell . 
  i think you meant from russian empire . 
  nato is [ helping us to protect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_air_policing ) our air-space so i doubt we would do that in first place . 
  this is nothing new . 
  the only time it will stop doing that if we shoot down their air-craft as turkey did . 
  adolfas was popular name in lithuania before ww2 . 
   on the banner were the faces of these `` heroes '' : adolfas ramanauskas-vanagas if he 's not a hero i do n't know what he is then . 
  le napoleon crossed vilnius when campaign against russian empire started , and then started to run back to france after tasting russian cold through lithuania yet again . 
  i remember one sentence from school that was in history books - `` when soldiers were running to church they saw a dog , they quickly chased it and ate it alive '' . 
  well in medieval times we imported some kebabs and gave them free land in favor of fighting in our army , they were called [ lipka tatars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars ) , they were brought somewhere at beginning of xiv c . they also helped us to secure our independence from greatest nemesis at that time - [ teutonic order ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_grunwald ) . 
  [ yes , we already knew that since xiv c. ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dqj78j4.png ) ;p, 
  [ i 'll give you something you will never be able to take off , broliukas . 
  i only bet for perk\u016bnas tho . 
  since my state recognise kosovo as independent , happy independence day kosovo !, 
  well they have been under foreign power till 1991 , so their mentality is very passive-aggresive . 
  or maybe we still are poland , in some ones head ?!, 
   [ absolutely ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd3dm2iumc8#t=4m22s ), 
  i think it just sound unnatural to spell f instead of t. 
  \u0160\u0161\u0161\u0161\u0161 , it 's all prijungimas now . 
  [ vytautas best ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nitlob098w8 ) !, 
  i 'd like to thank to you - ukraine for being there for us since battle of blue waters , together we had an amazing history before being taken away by foreign powers , but it 's not over , we 're not yet lost , together we shall form a bright future for our each other nations . 
  so stay strong ukraine and do not fear to fight for freedom . 
  russia is not our mother but stepmother !, 
  thank you , btw are n't you adopted ? 
  yes . 
  march 11 is our restoration day from ussr . 
  you , i love you too < 3, 
  thank you , broliukas < 3, 
  can confirm , this guy videos are best !, 
  til . 
  usa is a monarchy . 
  [ not much to know ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uogjv9l.png ) . 
  ^ ^ ^ dunno ^ ^ ^ why ^ ^ ^ author ^ ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ ^ use ^ ^ ^ glorious ^ ^ ^ vytis ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ lithuania ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ polish ^ ^ ^ eagle, 
  he looks like one of those we call babyface 's, 
  i think your russian minority was to become transnistria if you were to unite with moldovia . 
  we become a minority in our very own country ... : ^ (, 
  they stole our [ baltic brothers land ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_prussians ) and name . 
  never forget , never forgive !, 
  i 'm talking about moment when `` poland '' starts to be highlighted which i assume shows start of commonwealth while gif showed it far earlier than year 1569, 
  so that aggressor would feel brit pain . 
  food looks so yammy . 
  why do you keep brining people in this , they were aiming at military targets . 
  well [ it is not wrong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_union ) , but it 's wrong with polish-lithuanian commonwealth formation . 
  same about union of lublin . 
  if americans and russians are already firing nuclear weapons it pretty much says we 're all fucked , sitting down wo n't change a thing and only will show that you 're next to nothing on commitments you made . 
  i think we should n't look at past now , future is the most important part in which we must focus . 
  it did touch my heart , if i ever need to stand together with you in front lines , i will do it without a second thought . 
  nobody is going to attack my broliukas !, 
  nuclear strike on london is definitely an act of war , together with article v invoking it means invasion of russia to capture mad-mans that are responsible for death of innocent brits . 
  if possible to restore order and maybe at last friendly government towards west that such scenario would become only history . 
  true that we should create a very close military alliance than nato is but we should n't exclude other states just because . 
  joint trainings for future operations would only come in handy . 
  you literally want to give up territories that hold historical value which never had russians before terror of soviet union occupation came . 
  besides there is [ no 100 % russian territories ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/russians_in_baltic_states_%282011%29.svg/800px-russians_in_baltic_states_%282011%29.svg.png ) in the baltics . 
  in the movie their - british nuclear weapons would be fired on military targets , not civilians , so it makes no sense to not fire them if your capital gets nuked . 
  this is an auto-article v invoking . 
  would suggest to ignore them , they serve no purpose , only being a whiny as you said . 
  what i have seen from this movie was risk that kremlin brings to the rest of the world , an absolute nuclear armageddon . 
  those `` rebel '' russians for me were seen as a tools , as a puppets that are pulled by strings and few of them dying for no reason and vise versa , because some mad-man wants to gain `` influence '' and `` prestige '' . 
  this movie sparked a bigger patriotism in me , it showed that one day i will have to stand with my allies , my blood brothers - latvians against a historical aggressor that will never leave us alone . 
  this movie was definitely not aimed against russians or russian state itself , but against those who sit in kremlin , those mad-mans that would want such scenario to happen . 
  so please , do n't be one of those who always say that doing something that kremlin does n't want somehow interfere with russians . 
  latvia because balts stronk !, 
  and estonia ofc for their warm heart and together making a stand-off against soviets and russians . 
  maybe poland also ... ^ ^ ^ vilnius ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ forget, 
   marxism-leninism this ended with lenins death , when stalin started to reign it become a rogue state , a totalitarian dictatorship caring nothing but about expansion . 
  it was not directly made for russians but it was used as such , being `` sovietized '' was again only change of name from word `` russified '' . 
  nobody are blaming russia for ussr crimes but it acts as it was her empire or something , russian minorities are in love with ussr times since they had privileges in non-russian republics . 
  defend russia as much as you want , you ca n't change facts . 
  [ islandija best nordic !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljpdgwx2i30 ), 
  * russian language enforced onto non-russian speakers - check * spread of russian population through non-russian republics - check * suppressing national or any other form of freedom movement , with military actions - check * capital city/base of ussr being moscow -  kremlin - check ussr basically was russian empire 2.0 just with different name , whether you like it or not . 
  but you have higher chance of stand off an invasion till nato allies come , we ( baltics ) on other hand can be cut off entirely through suwalki gap . 
  trust me if war happens we will be the ones fucked , not you . 
  so estonia is now guilty ? 
  that 's ignorant cold war mentality that is still stuck in their head , i guess it will take some time before getting erased . 
  that we will [ support ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013polish\u2013ukrainian_brigade ) no matter what . 
  they might be failed state for now but they could climb out of it if some of western part of eu were n't so frigging russophiles . 
  nato ? 
  whataboutism is strong on this one . 
  then we 're definitely [ central europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg/683px-grossgliederung_europas-en.svg.png ) . 
  which you could end asap with removing presence from ukrainian territory . 
  sounds like a paradise !, 
  well , aivaras abromavi\u010dius ( ukrainian born in lithuania ) , minister of economic development and trade of ukraine , not long ago said about his resignation because of huge corruption , while western ambassadors are sad to see him being out , because he was one of few who actually cared about ukraine . 
  gudija being friend with lietuva ?
