  best day of my life !, 
  commonwealth stronk !, 
  if you 're ready to fight for the last lithuanian we are ready to fight for the last turk . 
  so ... heh ... can baltics ... heh ... into nordics ? 
  can confirm , same boat . 
  well if only you knew what [ we were doing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4fgv6np.jpg ) while being under nazis . 
  [ not again !, 
  do n't forget [ northern crusades ( baltic crusades ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades ) . 
  they erased old prussians , never forget , never forgive !, 
  what does this has to do with what you said ? 
  you straight insulted my and other fellow european countries . 
  next time speak for yourself . 
  that 's why kremlin is in fear , the sooner russians realize this and start standing up against it the more likely they 're out of their confy zone . 
  that 's why opposition is constantly getting threats and killed . 
  that 's what they feared in ukraine , that pro-eu people would want to distance from russia . 
  oh yes , i forget about it , as i said nordics are cool , we love you . 
  nobody considers usa to be a traitor , we just hoped whole western allies would start war against soviet union while which we could completely fuck ussr from inside with sabotage and get liberated by you , that was almost every single partisans dream `` for americans to come '' . 
  when your enemy never gave you peace of your time since late middle ages you sure know better than those russophiles at w. europe . 
  even if it was for geostrategic importance , that was one of the dumbest moves , it completely destroying russian economy and sending little green men into `` ukrainian civil war '' just shows how blind russian nation is . 
  all you need is to take your rifle bury yourself in snow , before that get some boozie from eesti and then you will become a hero . 
  in lithuanian history classes `` asian theater '' is covered but not a lot , only key parts . 
  do n't take it too personally . 
  for eastern half of europe war still did n't end till 1991 , especially to us , we had to fight in [ the invisible front ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_partisans ) . 
  how is that anti-russian ? 
  and here my children you see russian `` troll fabric worker '' in his natural habitat , shhhh do n't scare him off , and do n't make quick moves or he will run at you at full speed and start saying russia is love , russia is life . 
  so many lies ... may i ask how much they pay to you ? 
  or you 're just unsuccessful troll ? 
   lets not forget that russia wanted to join nato and was turned away you need to start reading about nato and russian relationship . 
   in march 2009 , the russian envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , in response to rados\u0142aw sikorski \u2032 s proposal , while not ruling out nato membership at some point in the future , was quoted as saying : ** `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . 
   nato is doing today - preparing for offensive warfare are you on drugs ? 
  what kind of an idiot would invade a country that has biggest nuclear arsenal . 
  and comparing nato to nazis ... fucking hell , get mental help . 
  crimea was out-right annexed , on region that russians are occupying is literally on talks about joining russian fed . 
  how is that not territorial expansion ? 
  russia 's whole history is to annex as much as possible . 
  tension started since beginning of lithuanian-muscovite wars ( mid 14 century ) and up until now tension did n't end . 
  same goes for rest of e. europe , kremlin is like a tumor of europe to us . 
  no , it is this [ little creature ] ( http://i.imgur.com/catiazi.png ) . 
  there are no fair wars . 
  not for russia though . 
  you do n't need hollywood to see that , ww1 and ww2 showed how unprepared they were . 
  for russia to not make offensive trainings like cutting off suwalki corner to make sure baltics are trapped which connects borders of poland and lithuania . 
  violating our air space . 
  being one of main targets when using propaganda about nato or something else . 
  etc. . . our fear is rational and history shows that . 
  we have a lot of investment from nordics , it should n't be a surprise . 
  gazprom forced us to pay far more than western part of europe , since they held full monopoly on here before lng , but no more . 
  we have danish bank also and iirc finnish petrol also . 
  do you realize how incompetent european army would be compare to that of nato , it would be a suicidal move at this time . 
  you swedes are always trying to stay neutral so do n't bs me here . 
  besides calling my country insignificant shows how quite mad you 're , get a chill pill , this is not `` flame war '' . 
  ever heard phoney war ? 
  it took them quite some time . 
  before that uk was even appeasing nazis . 
  you say hello , not sweden . 
  and yet you still show your butt-hurt , relax . 
  no but fear of invasion from neighboring country that has been hostile nation since mid-14th century is not unthinkable . 
  i wonder why ... hmm [ oh right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_the_baltic_states_ ( 1940 \\ ) ) . 
  you 're taking this too seriously . 
   eastern europe has been wanting to provoke russia for a while now . 
  how are we provoking ? 
  because we exist and are not in their pawn ? 
   anybody who thinks russia is about to invade an eu memberstate has completely lost his mind . 
  thanks but no , ukraine is prime example that russia did n't change it 's historical foreign policy . 
   and here we are people cheering for beating the war drums in a continent that merely 2 decades ago celebrated the fall of the wall that divided us . 
  russia was first who started drumming . 
   it woke up in 1990 finding itself in a position to build a prospering , free and peaceful continent , only to revert to old habits again . 
  say that to russia not us . 
  [ joining eu and nato - best day of my life !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmynp0ovv2c ), 
  well at least his name is now put into shame . 
  you just need to do a different approach . 
  but we 're great at basketball . 
  been at gates of moscow three times , not scared . 
  no need just send pole , lithuanian or mongol . 
   eastern europe hates turkey whaaat ? 
  turkey is one of the most popular holiday destinations for lithuanians and nobody has ever said any bad word about you . 
  you exaggerating too much . 
  burn moscow to ashes !, 
  oh sorry for being post-communist country , my fault . 
  there is literally no country in europe outside russia and it 's slaves that would want european army instead of nato . 
  only if kebabs are there . 
  and make a weaker , shitter version of nato ? 
  thanks no . 
  [ sanctions + low oil price ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_financial_crisis_ ( 2014 -- present \\ ) ) already gives enough spanking to russia . 
  i 'm sold . 
  speak for yourself . 
  all because of european union and nordic investment . 
  thank you . 
   swedes are tough nuts to crack [ lies !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ), 
  i see , makes me feel bad . 
  did we ? 
  were n't we fighting off swedes ? 
  [ did n't poland rule that ? 
  ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/abiej\u0173_taut\u0173_respublika#/media/file:abieju_tautu_respublika.png ), 
  what did we do ? 
  yeah , no . 
  same for us .
