   how dare we not staying under ~ ~ austrian ~ ~ russian boot in their dysfunctional empire , right ? 
  second map best map . 
  it 's too late for that , neither russia nor eu would want to have them in eu before they change their regime drastically . 
  shout out to latvians for being the only neighbor that did n't try to invade us !,

  i did n't even knew who she was until that topic came out . 
  i think she needs popularity or smth . 
  jews that are asking for it become happier , that 's all . 
  no , we upgraded them into horse taxis . 
  nah , you read mine again . 
  nah , if we ever go to nordic we taking our braliukas and eesti with us . 
  wages are different , what small for you might be big for us . 
  may i ask why ? 
  dear lord , my ears ... have mercy !, 
  jews are the only ones that want this .

  is n't it [ house of latvija ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/08/33/33/083333cd007e075ed66185f4f67f8760.gif ) ? 
  read my post again . 
  name `` vokietija '' sounds so cool , yet has unknown root . 
   yes , because fellow european is not so different ** , *** when compared to middle-eastern . 
  damn comma, 
  do n't worry , your soldiers already were meeting our civilians and showing off `` freedom stuff '' ;p, 
  will do . 
  you 're right , but we have fine experience in guerrilla warfare at least . 
  every single european nation treated each other like sh * t before aftermath of ww2 . 
  we evolved from being most brutal and warring continent to being richest and safest one . 
  problem is , russia still lives in past and that 's a big problem for half of europe not only poland . 
  [ shivers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) , at least prussians were protestant , that [ saved us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) from becoming [ forcefully russified ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_press_ban ) and losing our language and national identity . 
  there is no way russia can ever do that , especially when our russian minority ( less than 6 % ) is smaller than polish one , plus our soldiers already done [ training ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd3dm2iumc8 ) against such scenario . 
  the only chance to occupy the baltics now is full scale invasion from russian/belarusian borders and cutting off suvalkai corner which is between kaliningrad oblast and belarus . 
  i 'm pretty sure you would be first to [ help us out ] ( http://polandball.cc/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/smjnmot.png ) . 
  might as well adore stalin , he also sent people to die for no reason . 
  kremlin wants to control everything that surrounds them simple as that . 
  there is no threat to national security for russia though , but kremlin likes to use it as an excuse . 
  braliukas can into nemesis , how cute . 
  both obama and americans that pay tax money deserve a big hug . 
   but you are referring to the soviet union and the red army that invaded your country in the past . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_ ( history ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_uprising https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_press_ban russia was no different . 
   putin has not shown neither criminal litvinenko ? 
  crimea ? 
  putin is criminal , with immunity sadly . 
  more usa presence in baltic region wo n't change a thing on your theory , if monkey is mad , it will do mad stuff no matter what . 
  when some w. europe are n't very willful for keeping sanctions on russia for taking over crimea and supporting `` rebels '' in e. ukraine while at same time not willing to show their presence in e. europe instead of that american while being nato members i 'm pretty sure sphere of influence does n't exist here . 
  as i said it 's all but in your imagination , keep it to yourself . 
  germany will either way have to commit to article 5 if russia starts invasion , more stronger presence of usa will only lower possibility of russian invasion and possibly german commitment to article 5 . 
  things like these do n't touch germany as long as russia does n't go mad . 
  even after joining you have to ask for permission to station troops , armor vehicles etc nato has no `` sphere of influence '' it 's all but in your imagination . 
  why would germans even have anything to say when it 's e. europe and usa matter . 
  if you asked our opinion we 're very happy seeing you here and we 're thankful for your cooperation on protecting the region from external threat . 
  i , myself would like to say thank you and give you a strong hug . 
   ... we worry they might pull another `` ribbentrop-molotov '' on us . 
  same here bro , same here . 
  yes , because fellow european is not so different when compared to middle-eastern . 
  [ nothing changes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muscovite\u2013lithuanian_wars ) . 
  you must be kidding me ... 
  who said we would annex ? 
  we would join into glorious union of the grand duchy !, 
  thank you but no need to say sorry for something these animals did . 
  people who get these kind of salary usually do n't have any education in any field yet , mostly students are the ones that work for this kind of salary . 
  it 's little lower than minimum , so around ~ 300 euros,

  oh yes we can !, 
  only if you know the combinations . 
  you could try to come to lithuania , after not long ago tragic event we 're in need of more social workers now . 
  oh my , what kind of drug is he using , maybe he tried krokodil ? 
  well that 's probably the best russia could produce ... 
   liars are bad people , people do n't like liars . 
  do n't be a liar , be a good boy , always say truth . 
  tell that to your government . 
  feel sorry for you , it hurts to know that simple people like you have to suffer because of their government choices . 
  peter the great was probably one and only good leader of russia that cared about his people and country . 
  if i were him i would try to leave the country asap . 
   or non complying states should simply be removed from schengen and then what ? 
  we can create our own new schengen v2, 
  i do n't think they have those specific letters on their keyboards . 
  come here my little fascist ( \u3065 \u00b3 ) \u3065, 
  those are critics from w. european that want to appease russia for some reason . 
  we are more than happy seeing your presence and keeping region in peace and prosperity . 
  this article is like hidden message that we should feel sorry for russia , like we 're reason why russia has to go aggressive and it 's `` justifiable '' . 
  thank god and to perk\u016bnas that we 're out of reach for them . 
  to create hills somewhere in siberia ? 
  people from `` stratfor '' always make your head scratch when they speak . 
  whoa , til . 
  thank you . 
  what about that ? 
  turkey and romania are allies now . 
  both are used respectively . 
  thing is that we 're not under nato 's thumb , nato has no power here , we invite them , they do exercises , hell we even have to ask for more bases and stuff . 
  i doubt that 's going to happen , west does n't want that , neither do we . 
  a peaceful and friendly russia is what we dream about .
