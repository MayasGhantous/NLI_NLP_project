   the baltics were beyond reach for now , and belarus had a pro-russian government . 
  but either way , ukraine was the key , because the ukrainian border went through the agricultural heartland of russia so russia is just hungry ? 
  that article is interesting but makes my head scratch , it 's like i should feel sorry for russia when at same time they 're the ones that created this barriers . 
  lietuva stronk , lietuva can into warrings rusija !, 
  what 's is your opinion about teutonic order ( in lithuanian one of it 's translations is literally german order ) and later german prussia ? 
   what 's the worst thing the russian empire ever did to its citizens ? 
  i bet it does n't come close to the ottomans at their worst . 
  i answered this question , what re did was pretty much also oppressing minorities .

  because it was n't called like that in those times and plc is quite young name for this nation . 
  it 's same in our languages - abiej\u0173 taut\u0173 respublika / \u017de\u010dpospolita ( lt ) , rzeczpospolita obojga narod\u00f3w ( pl ) . 
  plus rzeczpospolita literally means res publica/commonwealth . 
  i 'm using english abbreviature because we 're in english mainly speaking forum . 
  relax , no need to get butthurt , and you 're right it was stereotypical but definetly not racism , you do n't even know what that word stands for . 
  russians are quite chauvinists when it comes to history that 's why i was shocked . 
  i 'm quite shocked though , it 's not hard to guess if you 're russian . 
  grand duchy of lithuania and later plc was main rivals . 
   `` med\u0117 '' ahh we see pure definition of samogitian dialect . 
  braliukas can into singing < 3, 
  that 's pretty much what i see when topic about ussr appears in that subreddit . 
  it is when those different countries do n't have equal rights , let alone self-determination . 
  even plc was more in favor of poland than lithuania because it was far bigger and more influential . 
  poland , ruthenia ( ukraine , belarus ( we even had old af name for them - gudija before soviets banned it and made belarussian mandatory use ) ) .

  no ... polish boyfriend !, 
  more than half of europe hates kremlin atm . 
  i never seen anyone being anti-turkish , and then there is kremlin which everyone hates here . 
  like russia any better , they should stop supplying `` rebels '' in east of ukraine .

  same boat here . 
  i never met anyone who would show hate towards muslim here in lithuania , at most we started a gag `` allahu akbar '' when playing video games and that 's all . 
  please , nobody are denying that vilnius had polish majority but it did n't meant that lithuanians or poles could n't live with each other in same country , belgium , switzerland are examples of what could have been modern lithuania if it was n't for your `` polska can into great power '' which pi\u0142sudski wanted let alone him being from polonized lithuanian nobility that originated in the gdl back in to even pagan times . 
  you got so many good and strong leaders from us that protect your nation from foreign invaders . 
  and then you tore up treaty that we signed up , making brothers , cousins families getting into different front lines , there are many stories about it , like two class buddies , one commanding for suvalkai front , other for polish and both making calls for each other just to stop these dog fights . 
   pi\u0142sudski stated : `` i tore up the suwa\u0142ki treaty , and afterwards i issued a false communique by the general staff . '', 
  quotas are stupid idea when more than half of migrants are not refugees but economic migrants .

  man if only old prussians remained and german prussians never came into existance , i wonder how history would have turned around for both of us . 
  i was not talking about you though .

  pretty much tells us about our future if we choose one of two paths . 
  that is so beautiful . 
  truly an extraordinary state at those times . 
  well that 's because it 's occupied by russia but is not recognized as such . 
  we and poles wo n't and never will `` swept it under the rug and fell over themselves to please putin . '', 
  yeah so ? 
  that does n't give them any right to go and say - `` it 's our clay now , cyka blayt '' .

  actually we would speak either polish or lithuanian , because glorious union inc. :p, 
  who need tanks when we can give them sexy lithuanian men to belarusians , that 's pretty much how gdl annexed parts of ruthenia ( belarus/ukraine ) :p, 
  not again ... 
  so can we invade ? 
  dreaming about that cross , do n't you ? 
   you said how russian see themselves in ussr , i gave you two different opinions on the matter . 
  which means your initial message about what russians thinks about nations in ussr is , at least , not 100 % true . 
  how is that not relevant ? 
  because nationalist point of view is easy to predict . 
  and those people who want ussr , let alone stalin to be back are really an oxymorons . 
  this is pretty much stance of europe that has been under communist rule . 
  does n't really matter , ussr was still a shit-fest state that should have been dissolved after wwii . 
  [ hungarian revolution of 1956 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) [ warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) [ january events in lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania \\ ) ) and that 's only part of ussr crimes through cold war period . 
  that info is not relevant at all , you just told me what russian nationalist thinks . 
  actually yes , mostly because russian was brought as lingua franca through occupied territories . 
  same economical direction and common foreign policy is what keep us in touch . 
  there is no need for us to unite , because all three have common currency ( euro ) , belong to eu ( including schengen area ) and nato ( common military drills etc ) . 
  of course these kind of stuff would be great first step to show europe that federalization is possible but we need to deepen our ties more before that can happen . 
  belarus , ukraine - ruthenia and russia - muscovy was already a separate entity in ~ xiv century . 
  what you 're trying to tell me is that russian nationalist thoughts are all that matter ... 
  todays russia actions are showing that they 're the only ones holding on the past ... 
  we did n't had ss legions like latvia had . 
  anyway at first we actually greeted nazi german werchmant army because of first brutal soviet occupation , when ss officers came we started passive resistance against both nazis and soviets . 
  till 1953 ~ when last freedom fighers of lithuania ( partisans ) were killed there was no real resistance anymore . 
  russia had a chance to join nato , you want to know why it did n't ? 
   the russian envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , in response to rados\u0142aw sikorski \u2032 s proposal , while not ruling out nato membership at some point in the future , was quoted as saying : `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . '',
