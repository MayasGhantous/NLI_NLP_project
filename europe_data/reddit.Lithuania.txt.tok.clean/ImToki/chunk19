  said mountain german . 
  maybe that 's where finnish happiness went :o / s, 
  very well made site . 
  long live balts !, 
  we will never perish . 
  i doubt anyone would want to form union with austria knowing austria 's history . 
  `` god with us/god wills it ... '' so i guess it is . 
  oh yeah , we 're ledai ( icecream ) !, 
   gott mit uns  as we all stand united  all together gott mit uns -  from the old world 's demise  see an empire rise  from the north reaching far  here we are i love this song so much . 
  tunnels man , tunnels , we would be like dwarfs . 
  a dream for lithuanians ` q ', 
  do we get mountains ? 
  if so , yis yis yis , gib clay . 
  before ussr annexation , since the times of our forefathers , we called belarus , gudija . 
  sounds like m\u0117lynas kalnas , blue mountain ;p, 
  you mean baltarusija ? 
  yeah it should be named gudija and be under us . 
  yes , it is . 
  apparently p-l commonwealth still lives . 
  they took our children !, 
  uk - apvienota karaliste , heh , it makes a lot of sense in lithuanian . 
  they took our land , again !, 
  \u010c - master letter . 
   jung ... karalyste ... u fockin wot i thought you was referring comedy movie made by brits and lithuanians - [ redirected ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inkmg9cckqw&amp;index=7&amp;list=pl0tfc3qjvqpjmwpcbnw5ce0vexqqabas2#t=0m40s ), 
  did we took a candy from you or what ? 
  why so much hate ? 
  possible , but unlikely . 
  commonwealth vs ~ ~ teutonic ~ ~ jedi order all over again !, 
   during the 13th century the duchy of lithuania was bordered by slavic lands . < ...  slavs did not create the name ; they used the existing lithuanian ethnonym . 
  the lithuanian diphthong - ie - has , in slavic languages , shifted to the vowel - i - ( \u0438 ) , hence litva . 
  this is evidence that the slavs borrowed this ethnonym from lithuanians a long time ago . 
  the same what lenkija means in lithuanian , a name that comes from one of the tribes - lechs . 
  yes , he wanted to be litwa :\\ ^ ), 
   \u017diva very similar to gyva - alive . 
   aja also sounds like aij - `` oh right '' haha, 
  then prepare , for laum\u0117s shall drown you into your babies blood as their necks are twisted to other side ... erm sorry , too much into baltic lore . 
  yeah , but we have far older name for belarus which was `` gudija '' , i have no idea why we 're not using it instead of `` baltarusija '' . 
   are n't welsh english ? 
  [ rip your city ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/6/62/fanart-1284-large.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20131213172352 ), 
  why you did that lenkija , if not it we would been second belgiu ... wait ... thank you polska !, 
  luckily for us , they were too weak when we were going for eu/nato membership . 
  they were so desperate that at that time president of russia - dmitry medvedev , told us he would make prices of gas a lot lower if we left nato ... 
  but they were so playful and friendly the moment i told that i believe in only one true god - perk\u016bnas , now i see why . 
  wait ... 
  so you 're saying i was n't dancing with actual elves in woods yesterday ? 
  it was just yet another unsuccessful soviet mission . 
  though that first reporter is very cute . 
  whenever i see anschluss eyes it always makes me chuckle . 
  blood was still spilled , and there were tries to create separatist republic somewhere in vilnius region but it failed completely , nobody was supporting it . 
  thank you for your solidarity . 
  that 's the only strategy they got when it comes to keeping away surrounded states from eu/nato that do not want to kneel by russian flute . 
  just use old lithuanian name for it - gudija . 
  ukraine , belarus and russian once belonged to same entity before splitting , colors ( like white ) are based on geographical place . 
  eesti is sad now . 
  before su we had even more specific name for belarus - gudija . 
  monakas - as, 
  da lat da da lat da , da lat da da lat da da-da-da dun-diddle un-diddle un-diddle uh da-da, 
  i 'm bad at understanding it . 
   women are chained in our kitchens . 
  yeah sure ... 
  hashtag ruined it . 
  god , what on earth are you ? 
  what does stalin has to do with this ? 
  this guy was saying `` we will never achieve our independence it 's impossible '' , even after using force against unarmed civilians he lost . 
  it 's like giving award for `` rapist '' for `` not being rapist '' . 
  which is so wrong . 
  and this is why you will be always welcome here in lithuania , we have been waiting for you since end of world war ii and now , when we know you got our back we can live at peace of our time , at last . 
   he was awarded the otto hahn peace medal in 1989 , the nobel peace prize in 1990 and the harvey prize in 1992 , as well as honorary doctorates from various universities . 
  so disgraceful . 
  thank you brother . 
  your nation showed solidarity to us with your praying and humanitarian aid after first news reached you about this . 
   only the old people were not defending the parliament and the tv tower i would say those collaborating pro-soviet f * cks should be put in shame , i see reason why were would be less old people defending it . 
  this is no place to make jokes . 
  events like these always makes my patriotism grow even further . 
  it shows how much can be succeeded by just showing your faith and not backing out even if it means being in front of gun or tank . 
  it 's actually russian government not russians themselves , most of russians just get brainwashed . 
  iirc at those times thousands of russians in moscow stood in protest against soviet aggression in front of kremlin . 
  what is most sad that old lady , russian speaking one took stand in front of soldiers with rest of lithuanians and asked why they 're here , after those words she got hit by `` botans '' . 
  `` vatniks '' maybe , since word represent stupid form of patriotism . 
  canadian guy does apparently . 
   putin : in 2014 , we invited everyone to have a g8 meeting in russia . 
  it was the others who did not come . 
  russia is always willing to participate in the g8 meetings again , but we have not bought any tickets for the journey yet . 
  that 's some new level of `` forever alone '' . 
  ca n't get to a party , make your own party and invite people that do not like you . 
  man can have dreams right ? 
  lol, 
  what you mean so much attention ? 
  he 's monster down here , of course he will get more attention . 
  roosevelt , churchill , napoleon etc have n't done so much evil to us as stalin did , hitler is the only one who surpass him on being madman . 
   disgraceful , russia should ban free speech so this does n't happen anymore . 
  wait a minute . 
  one wrong does n't make other right . 
  pretty much this , i do n't understand why , a country that never seen russian oppression or atrocities has a right to speak on what we should do with russia . 
  then tell russia to piss the fuck off with their threats and cryings about `` rightful sphere of influence '' . 
  russian minorities outside russia . 
  2004 * , just comedy with stereotypical stuff . 
  it 's a `` eurotrip '' reference . 
  historic russia started on european continent , always spoke east slavic language and was christian orthodox and having similar culture to rest of e. europe ( belarus , ukraine ) up to this day . 
  turkey does n't have any of this , you just happen to gain a little land in europe .
