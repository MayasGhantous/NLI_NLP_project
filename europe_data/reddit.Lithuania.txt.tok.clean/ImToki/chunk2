  yeah right , france , uk , germany economies are not going to minus for your information . 
  they 're not supporting rebels and boosting military power while sacrificing common people money . 
  good i would n't keep talking with brain washed putins monkey . 
  he 's european . 
  europe can claim anyone that belongs to europeans . 
  agree . 
   stratfor this tells me it 's obviously retarded . 
  neo-commonwealth could though . 
   that 's incorrect lol . 
  russia has actively prevented countries from entering nato through the funding and aiding of separatists . 
  they still have the eurasian economic union , and csto . 
  belarus , kazakhstan , armenia , belarus and kyrgyzstan are all members of . 
   russians ca n't even hold on it 's `` yard '' ca n't you read ? 
  they literally initiate war and destroy peoples lives just because they ca n't hold on their `` yard '' . 
  while nato countries are happily living nice lives with growing economy . 
  good for russia being corrupt shit hole . 
  it is next to nothing when compared to eu and i doubt you would want to have russia as leader of such union . 
  csto , yeah again , nato wannabe . 
   neither does china , yet they are a very powerful country . 
  alliances only mean so much . 
  difference is that china 's economy is growing , it sells cheapest stuff to the world , including economic partnership with usa while russia 's economy sinks down toilet . 
   nope . 
  a massive and powerful army can be well maintained with a good budget - something which does n't change near regardless of economic position . 
  army clearly means something , otherwise the syrian army would n't have been advancing for months , taking most of latakia province and recently palmyra . 
  see ukraine , moldova and georgia for other examples . 
  you can maintain military with good enough budget , but when your country goes bankrupt all states will go ape shit on who controls what , aka civil war . 
   russia is as likely as the uk to go bankrupt . 
  russia is nowhere close to uk . 
  you should compare yourself to italy who 's still richer than russia . 
  what bias , when it 's already well known fact . 
  russians ca n't even hold on it 's `` yard '' and you talk about influence on geopolitics like syria , the only reason why russia is in syria is because of assad dictatorship who wants to hold grip on power against rebels and isis . 
  russia has no real ally who is at least relevant somehow these days . 
  anyway army means nothing , when your economy is going down the toilet , sooner or later russia will bankrupt itself if it keeps invading countries such as ukraine , moldova and georgia . 
  here is your `` kurwa '' sir , do not forget to use it . 
  it was inefficient part because nobility would be brided ( which they were ) by neighboring monarchs to elect their puppets as king and grand duke of commonwealth . 
  commonwealth had biggest nobility number in all of europe . 
  at that time nobility was 10 % of the population , and burghers were 15 % . 
  so it was democratic for it 's time . 
  insulting times of commonwealth : accepting that times of when union of k\u0117dainiai might happen were best . 
  grand duchy best duchy . 
  but you love russia now !, 
  are you crazy , you want [ 20 min ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ) long film ? 
  russia losses in everything out side nukes . 
  zhironovskiy is like americas ' trump , but instead of building walls he insist to invade everything . 
  [ do not take the little cunts from us !, 
   russia due to its internal problems , a large portion of the blame does lie on the west for not honouring many of its pledges and promises . 
  stop blaming russia , poland , baltics , romania , bulgaria etc all made through their hard times , but for some reason russia and anyone who allied with her did n't , it 's simply as that , that their culture is different and has to be changed in order to stop acting as corrupt hell hole . 
  peasants master race !, 
  i 'm suffering under non-shortage of mandarins !, 
  and the colours of buildings , i want my grey sh * t-looking buildings back , ah my eyes !, 
  scared , because this is creepy . 
  well he 's controversial figure , mentioned as key figure to why we lost disputed territory , and probably why we manage to secure independence against soviets , because of your victory over them . 
  but we do . 
  :(  pi\u0142sudski stated : `` i tore up the suwa\u0142ki treaty , and afterwards i issued a false communique by the general staff . '', 
  if you do n't annex vilnius , we 're good . 
   stephan bandera every nation has controversial figures in history , so what ? 
   lucjan \u017beligowski and j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski are non honourable cunts in our book . 
  it has to live up turkey 's life time . 
  i had half-ukrainian room mate , friendliest motherfucker you could ever meet . 
  lithuania was first to get ukraine though . 
  we saved them from them mongols . 
  he 's trolling you , of course he wants to nordic . 
  ei , we only angry at you for post ww1 not commonwealth !, 
  all we need is second battle of blue waters and ukraine can into eu . 
  [ rawr rawr ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/f/f9/nepal-rawr.png/revision/latest?cb=20140601180948 ), 
  that is the most cutest gif i ever seen in my life !, 
  those with weapons and who are storming buildings are more than enough to distinguish . 
  just take our noble and make him your king and everything will be like old days . 
  hand over crown of kingdom of poland and nobody gets hurt !, 
  unlikely , the moment they appear they would get crushed instantly by our and nato forces . 
  extremist to what ? 
  love ? 
  come here ... 
   depends . . do you talk to people in the busstops are you crazy ? 
  we are trying to avoid eye contact !, 
   and do you like saunas ? 
  are you crazy ? 
  we even have public sauna in our small city ( ~ 16700 ) !, 
   `` we miss our ussr empire ! '', 
  they only remember the tentacles but not the teeth of the regime . 
  yeah , we [ trained ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd3dm2iumc8 ) long ago with such unlikely but possible scenario, 
  no , because that would literally be suicide for them . 
  our russian minority is irrelevant , not only it 's [ small ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/russians_in_baltic_states_%282011%29.svg/300px-russians_in_baltic_states_%282011%29.svg.png ) they know very well that supporting russia in annexation is most idiotic thing you can imagine . 
  if only we did n't border russia ... hell , we are bordering most militarized region on europe . 
  please uncle usa , protect us !, 
  not really , we just jailed [ extreme side ] ( http://g3.dcdn.lt/images/pix/zalgirio-ir-lech-rungtynes-uztemde-antilietuviskas-ispuolis-64206336.jpg ) organisers who were promoting conflict between ethnic groups . 
   translation : `` lithuanian `` lamer '' bow before polish lord '', 
  can we annex you broliukas ? 
  yes we do actually ... care . 
  if we do not impose some kind of restrictions he will keep using salami tactics and soon you will see in england , `` people republic of kent '' . 
  that 's why we put faith on you . 
  lithuanian 15min ' reporter is spending his time in donbass right now and was surprised how little people started to care about artillery landing near them , it seems like it started to be daily life for them . 
  why not , good exercise . 
  you go for meat :d, 
  you can cross with a bicycle . 
  buying meat in poland already caused big shitstorm . 
  so yeah ... 
   nobody on the grand level cares about ? 
  we , poland other ex-eastern bloc do care . 
  you have big number of countries that are in eu who would like to see ukraine in our side .
