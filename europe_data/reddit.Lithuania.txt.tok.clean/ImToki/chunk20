  nothing personal . 
  it was doing quite well when [ peter the great ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_the_great ) was on throne ... because it actually looked to integrate to west . 
   you know america was founded by prudes . 
  prudes who left europe because they hated all the kinky , steamy european sex that was going on . 
  and now i , / u/shiraazmohamed , will return to the land of my perverted forefathers and claim my birthright ... which is a series of erotic and sexually challenging adventures . 
  communism was n't good for our business . 
  well they could n't start another war , we were just left behind . 
  [ lipka tatars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars ) are well integrated since 14th century , let 's say , `` commonwealth '' lands . 
  estonia big , estonia stronk !, 
  great person and of course basketball player . 
  honor to all of lithuania to have such star . 
  because ukraine has a lot of support from eu members , especially ones that were under iron curtain . 
  baltic states , poland etc are suffering heaviest from taking sanctions on russia by ourselves , yet we keep screaming for russia to piss off from ukraine , and i 'm happy that we 're not turning our back from ancient ally . 
  but we have our own monster * coughrussiacough *, 
  consider that today 's russia is fascist state that meets almost all criteria in europe . 
  do n't worry , title made me giggle after watching video . 
  even more depressed than depressed . 
  the [ finnic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnic_languages ) tunnel . 
  actually it 's not media but old people who blow the bubble . 
  3-8 euro cents rise of prices , god help we 're doomed like greece . 
  god literally hitler . 
  `` from thousand years onward i 'll reincarnate as powerful frog '' - imtoki 666:666, 
   parents know what 's best for their children and have the right to make those choices without consequences . 
  just because you can procreate does n't mean you know how to sustain life you have given . 
  you 're not a doctor . 
   god has a plan for us and would n't let little children die from those diseases . 
  are you saying that god is the only one that can save lives . . ? 
  if yes , you 're a clown . 
  still russia actions showed they would never want to settle in peace , this fear is rational for ee . 
   s\u016bds actually we have word similar to it - \u0161\u016bdas , word for shit . 
  he he he, 
   s\u016bgis sounds and looks like sugys which is `` heal '' . 
  colours are very confusing in some parts . 
  any way for lithuania ruduo most likely comes from word rudas which means `` brown '' colour , because nature starts to look more `` brown '' . 
  otherwise etymology of word is unknown . 
   that 's something a lot of european countries could say about one or more of their neighbours prior for most of their existence , until suddenly it was n't true anymore . 
  most of european countries are either in eu or nato . 
  so they 're allies . 
   he 's quite stupid enough to go after a nato country of course he 's not going to do a direct invasion , he will do same sh * t he does everywhere , create `` break-away republic '' to protect russian minority who was forced let 's say onto latvia and estonia during soviet times . 
  thank god we refused several offers for joint attack against you , together with germany . 
   if anything people are using the `` russia will invade '' rethoric to propagate fear and probably to benefit either economically or politically from it yeah , no , moscow since day one of it 's existence was our nr . 
  1 enemy and never an ally . 
  considering those times , yes we did had it for long time , guess being one of the last regions in europe to convert to christianity helped . 
  sabaton truly are one of the coolest metal bands , `` swedish pagans '' and `` wehrmacht '' are my favorite . 
  yeah , and then from polish minority they would become russian minority . 
  you do knew that polish lithuanians opposed lithuanian independence from ussr ? 
  they were used for creating break away region but were unsuccessful . 
  your media blows bubbles out of problems that are minor and non-matter in everyday life , that 's why your government does n't care . 
  and yet typical polish `` victims '' are crying for help , they cry for not getting hired for their dream job because they ca n't speak lithuanian language and when they get more hours in school on lithuanian language as any other lithuanian they cry it 's too hard for them . 
  and then your media just blows it out of bubble homo-gay lithuania oppressing glorious-alwaysvictim-neverwrong polish minority, 
   indeed , the irony of this is hillarious . 
  always puts a smile on my face on a lone occasion i think about lithuania or see a photo of wilno . 
  you do know he 's pro-kremlin puppet who did n't improve neither lithuanian nor polish relations even after being elected , he uses minor problems to get himself noticed and to grab free votes . 
  i do n't get what 's up with you poles what we did wrong that we deserve your hatred ? 
  you 're ones that broke treaty you signed and annexed wilno/vilnius like russia did with crimea and yet you 're victim ? 
  most likely if you approached like friend half of lithuania would be polish but at least we would be friends not enemies . 
  we most likely would been just another belgium . 
  you should read about [ polish-lithuanian identity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ), 
  commonwealth is for word similar to republic ( even though it looks far from it ) - \u017de\u010dpospolita ( lt ) , rzeczpospolita ( pl ) . 
  there was no ethnic nation at those times , grand duchy of lithuania , ruthenia ( ancestors of russia , belarus and ukraine , last two did n't exist as separate entity for longer ) and samogitia , was multi ethnic nation , multi religious , the problem was that lithuanians did n't have written form of our own language even though it existed for centuries , being minority did n't help either , son of grand dukes had to marry and adopt most likely language and culture of ruthenians . 
  since poland actually was one of reasons why we did n't become kingdom but stayed grand duchy with their sabotage on crown delivery made us even lesser partner of union , which meant in return for adopting polish language and culture our noble men would get same rights that polish nobles had . 
  tl ; dr ethnic lithuanian grand duke married king ( queen ) of poland and making personal union , most of dukes were lithuanian until actual union happened . 
  lithuania was minority in grand duchy of lithuania , ruthenia and samogitia . 
  ofc an out-side king , as we electing him while we get money in our pockets from russia and germany !, 
  do n't do it , i need you !, 
   the consequence of 15 years of aggressive nato policies like nato-expansion into the east i always laugh my ass off when i see false statements like this one . 
  absolute joke , not a fact for argument . 
  amen brother , we 're lucky ones . 
   very is huge difference between veiled nuclear threats and country losing influence in the last countries it had under influence it does n't deserve one in first place if it can not maintain influence without usage of armed or political force . 
   but do you actually have security when the whole thing relies on someone else protecting you ? 
  it goes both ways , we can feel that we 're safe , at same time we have to be in fear that they might not be there when we need them most , so i ca n't give clear answer for it . 
   what happens if the us decides to leave nato ? 
  if usa ever happen to leave nato we 're most likely screwed , in other words germany , france or any other major european power might want to play with us as buffer state with russia . 
  best case scenario would be complete `` finlandization '' , i guess . 
  you 're right , but we have no other choice , eu is far for having an army , and relying on european powers like germany , france is dumb idea since most of their history is to appease russia . 
  there is no back up plan , such small nation of barely 3 mil . 
  people will always have to rely on some one bigger to make sure we 're not getting invaded by * cougt * russia * cough *, 
  half of our army for sure was made by mercenaries from `` bulbaland '' . 
  their geographical location and landscape itself is main reason , not numbers . 
  if that means us having security , then yes , i 'm not opposing it . 
  though i 'm disappointed by this . 
  well i can only speak for my small city ( 16000 ~ residents ) , old commie blocks and gymnasiums got shit ton of funds ( e.g. 
  my ex gymnasium , [ before ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/44095573.jpg ) and [ after ] ( http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/static.panoramio.com/photos/original/99397955.jpg ) ) . 
  actually not anymore , euromonies are doing their job . 
  north-central lithuania also has snow . 
  most of europe is , good to be european . 
  do n't take our snow !, 
  yeah , we would love to not live next to you . 
  both are right . 
  union of soviet socialist republics or in short soviet union . 
   most lands currently in latvia and estonia were lithuania back then i do n't see latvia and estonia being in possession of grand duchy of lithuania , ruthenia and samogitia . 
  [ what ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts#/media/file:baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg ) like for real , [ what ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/teutonic_order_1260.png/1024px-teutonic_order_1260.png ) ? 
  you do know lithuania even after creating gdl and then becoming plc was about to face annihilation of it 's culture and language ? 
  being annexed into russian empire stopped polonisation , and then [ prussian lithuanians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) are the reason why our language manage to survive through re times . 
  no problem , hussars will save the day again . 
  heheh it 's anglija in lithuanian . 
  i do n't see latvia in this alliance . 
  it has to do more with genetics rather than linguistics . 
  lithuanians do not like this map .
