  relax bro , it 's not uncommon thing , i understand you . 
  what 's is their purpose ? 
  try to create ukranian reich ( tsardom ) ? 
  and then commit mass suicide ? 
  never experienced that stop button would n't work , maybe you were on older buses ? 
  yeah , kingdom of lithuania was suppose to have german noble on the throne , even though he accepted he never actually came to lithuania which divided our newly formed government , which made us create republic rather than being monarchy . 
   also btw baltic provinces [ 2 ] prior to wwi refered to smaller territory than modern baltic states that 's because we were n't occupied by german elite and manage to establish nation , so our history turned different ways . 
   describing himself as a descendant of the culture and traditions of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth  the pi\u0142sudski family is a family of nobility that originated in the grand duchy of lithuania  the family was polonized lithuanian nobility that over time became part of the polish nobility ( szlachta )  the pi\u0142sudskis date back to pagan times in lithuania and are recorded from the 13th century . 
  i see this as common in lithuania . 
  come to lithuania then . 
  actually since i frequently travel from a to b or reverse i see a lot of people saying `` viso gero '' ( goodbye ) . 
  size by ethnic population , civil wars for power in medieval times , late christianity etc. 
  there are a lot of reasons why we could n't be equal in true sense . 
  i do n't think you can call jogaila being lithuanian influence as he married and accepted to be king of poland granting gdl nobles same rights that poles had rather than reverse . 
  it 's truly kind of shit situation , i think if vilnius/wilno and suvalkai/suwalki conflict did n't happen in interwar period our relations would be 30x time better . 
  yeah pretty much . 
  jogaila one of the reasons why teutonic order was killed for good , pilsudski one of the reasons poland won polish-soviet war . 
  both had their roots deep into lithuania . 
  what makes you think that e. eu states does n't want it ? 
  no , it 's you who should come back to us . 
  ye sure , `` spared '' , `` elite '' , `` having money to buy things '', 
  in your dreams maybe . 
  may i ask something ? 
  what are opinions about aivaras abromavi\u010dius , your current minister of economy and trade ? 
  as much as this is good to see , i do n't think russia gives a single **** . 
   or had relatives that were somehow connected to soviet government or military funnily every friend i met had a lot of anti-soviet relatives , some times even those that would join wehrmacht just to fight against soviet union . 
  there is a person i know who 's grandfather had experience on driving a tank and took off on invasion of su , because at first occupation of lithuania red army soldiers raped his wife . 
  it 's a running gag that eesti wants so much into nordic but will never get in . 
  there is exactly same looking commies blocks there . 
  god dammit commies . 
  not really . 
  out side south east prussian region poland is pretty much where it started .

  usa fell ? 
  india fell ? 
  past = / = modern times . 
  \u017de\u010dpospolita , thank you for your letters , so we could spit on pi\u0142sudski 's face . 
  they would be kings/queens of their respected sub-territories like they 're today , queen of uk would stay queen of uk . 
  they are holding a symbolic power , there is no need to change that , it 's irrelevant . 
  why would they need that in the first place ? 
  beautiful, 
   its called fairy chimney google 'd it and realized that internet ruined me . 
   what happens to the royal families ? 
  do they keep their current positions ? 
  are they codified into one system ? 
  or are they completely abolished ? 
  they stay where they are , without any meaningful power . 
  like today . 
  something better than those two . 
  good to see american troops . 
  you 're always welcome here . 
  a guy who has `` stop the eu '' flair and says fuck nato ... 
  i see you really want another great war to happen , do n't you ? 
   there were homegrown communist uprisings in all these countries , they considered it a good idea because they wanted to expell/eradicate all germans . 
  source ? 
  since at least in lithuania we jailed every nazi or communist that showed on our territory in interwar period . 
   when all german communities were booted out of eastern europe and eastern europeans either supported or ignored the communist uprising they started to wonder wether this was a good idea . 
   it was too late then , but you very much helped yourself in that position . 
  uhm . 
  not counting partisan wars , there was also [ hungarian revolution of 1956 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) , [ prague spring ( 1968 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prague_spring ) which forced [ `` warsaw pact '' invasion of czechoslovakia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) , then [ 1972 unrest in lithuania aka kaunas ' spring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_unrest_in_lithuania )  on may 14 , 1972 , a ** 19-year-old ** high school student named ** romas kalanta ** poured 3 liters of gasoline on himself and set himself on fire in the square adjoining the ** laisv\u0117s al\u0117ja ** in front of the kaunas musical theatre , ** where in 1940 the people 's seimas had declared the establishment of the lithuanian ssr ** . 
  before the suicide , kalanta left his notebook with a brief note that read ** `` blame only the regime for my death '' ** . 
  ** it was only in 1990 , when lithuania declared its independence , that the content of this note became publicly known . 
  **  kalanta died 14 hours later in the hospital . 
  on may 18 , the soviet authorities hastened kalanta 's burial by 2 hours to prevent publicity there was many , i mean a lot of protests against soviet killing machine , nobody wanted to be part of that failed ideology , nobody sane wanted to be allied with second most evil country on earth which was ran but second most evil person on earth , though it became first evil since nazi germany was already defeated . 
  just because they held us under iron first does not mean we wanted to be their friend . 
  um , [ nope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_european_anti-communist_insurgencies ) .

  something , something grand duchy ' most tolerant state . 
  well i would n't mind being inside of you . 
  like you 're relevant , ha . 
  besides why it would matter , not like we pretend to be relevant . 
  lenkija and rusija is worst thing that happened to this world - lithuania . 
  yeah but we had ukraine as our ally far longer than any other nation e.g. 
  medieval period . 
  well old commieblocks are getting at the moment massively renovated to look more modern so it does n't really matter if they disappear . 
  well euromonies are [ fixing it ] ( http://www.15min.lt/images/photos/622931/original/renovuotas-daugiabutis-esantis-sodu-g-9-mazeikiuose-vrm-nuotr-5437a1fa4787a.jpg ) , kinda .

  happy independence day , georgia !, 
   why does it have to again ? 
  because our topic was about russians ? 
   russians had been raiding our territories for centuries , that 's why . 
  and they continued to do that throughout the middle ages until they finally conquered the territory . 
  teutonic/livonian territory * , not yours . 
  russia did not exist till 1547 by that time you were already a battle field between major powers of the region ( e.g.
