  poland-lithuania ) . 
   you actually claim that lithuanians are some kind of special people with a much longer history of warfare against russians ... that lack of education is bothering me so much on you . 
  no , you 're just butt hurt for not seeing estonia above all . 
   again , are you for real ?? 
  peasants vs knights , what a great conflict . 
  still does n't involve russia vs latvians , estonians . 
   of course , every nation can only have one enemy . 
  i do n't know how russia could have been your enemy when they were n't the ones that occupied you at that time , your occupants waged wars to russians not you . 
  and they organized land militias of estonians and latvians as well and the locals still perished in those conflicts against germans , not russians . 
   seriously , how fucked up nationalistic the lithuanian history education can be ? 
  you really need a chill pill , your mental stability is getting over the sky , just to show how much you hate russians , you 're the one nationalistic here sadly . 
   do you actually claim that lithuanians have a long history of warfare with russians and estonians and latvians do n't ? 
  unlike your nation we stood our ground and fought back foreign invaders , your enemy was germans at that time not russians , teutonic/livonian order was the one that fought against russians not latvians or estonians . 
   lol , like estonians and latvians have n't had `` bad blood '' with them even longer than the 14th century like ? 
  i do ? 
  yes we are . 
  we have been adversary with russia since mid 14 century . 
  we got far more bad blood ( historically speaking ) with them than you do . 
  half of us do . 
   this can be pinpointed to the memories of soviet repression sadly it goes deeper than that , from the [ deluge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_ ( history \\ ) ) times , to [ occupation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_partition_of_poland ) for 123 years by russian empire and [ language oppression ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_press_ban ) that fallowed . 
  and giving us a total [ psycho as governor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky ) , that would be nick named `` hangman of vilnius '' . 
  other than belarus and russophiles in e. ukraine , russia does n't have any support in e. europe . 
   alzheimer 's what you mean by that ? 
  please do not lump every european into one , we 're different people , with different culture , different politics and different national interests , do n't lump europeans who really sees you as saviour of european continent to those who talk shit . 
  oh yes , we 're beggars , how [ ca n't we defend ourselves against nation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmynp0ovv2c ) that only has ~ 46x bigger population , that has nuclear weapons , that has been our [ adversary since middle ages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muscovite\u2013lithuanian_wars ) . 
  [ love you america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states#list_of_recognition_and_non-recognition_of_annexation ) . 
  there was no benefit for prussians . 
  it 's that protestant  orthodox religion ( though lithuania is officially a roman catholic , out side memelland ) when it comes to rights of minority . 
  germans felt our and polish pain . 
  no it 's a [ thing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/refhodn.jpg ) that causes [ war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_war ) . 
  you 're right , problem was polonization and forgetting your own customs and national identity which was n't even important back in the day . 
  so it 's pretty much selling your own soul for something else . 
  do n't do it !, 
  good old days , eh ? 
  [ moment when germans are the good guys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) . 
  you 're closer to russians than we are  , 
  only near lakes or other natural water source . 
   do you want to be eaten alive by bugs ? 
  i thought that was only possible in australia ? 
  damn america , you 're scary . 
  fascist pribaltika why ca n't they speak russian ? 
  we saved you , open your ass cheeks . 
  they have bears with machine guns attached on them . 
  it 's not belarusian forces that are going to attack us , but russian ones , belarus is just territory from which aggressor could launch an attack but it ca n't be an actual threat because it has no actual power ... other than building power plant right next to our border . 
   ok , but they are and they show the peoples ' opinions . 
  some * people opinions that is going to fade over time , it also depend on whom they ask , what age group they choose etc. 
  and on russian subreddit you will find how russia is great , how ussr was great , how putin is great leader etc. 
  we have nothing in common with other baltic states other than having same foreign policy and being in same language group with latvians . 
   also i 've seen the opinion polls in which poland is considered second most dangerous country to lithuania , right after russia and there 's quite a lot of anti polish sentiment . 
  to me these kind of polls are bullshit . 
  not really . 
  other than poles who have superiority complex and lithuanians with inferiority complex . 
  probably poland , belarus is way too russified . 
  other than language we 're the same . 
   enemy of enemy is my friend pretty much how lithuanian and polish relations got revived . 
  macedonia for sure . 
   poland & lithuania still a big way to go . 
  you tell us . 
  heir to lithuanian throne is ` prince that was promised ' . 
  the plan is going well , soon hordes will settle that land . 
  too much cold war for you . 
  it has more to do with holy roman empire , austrian empire , polish-lithuanian commonwealth , teutonic-livonian order , russian empire , german empire , swedish empire etc. 
  it just shows how much great power in the past influenced territories culturally that are still seen today ( buildings , religion , customs etc ) . 
  because we still live in a past , give it a time . 
  eslali federation . 
  you know you 're coming with us . 
  :\\ ^ ) we 're born for each other . 
  broliukas is same blood , does n't matter . 
  no , it was very flawed . 
  hitler just believed in his retarded idea of pure race . 
  do n't worry , we all belong to master race . 
  something , something that caused ~ 600 years alliance disappear over night , after ww1 . 
  how so ? 
  stealing money from his own country , sending innocent soldiers to die for his own gain ( into separatist republics of e. ukraine ) , causing russia into shitty economical situation etc. 
  judging from our western standards , he 's absolute sh * t. 
  because russians ca n't catch a break with a really good leader . 
  every nation is mix of different people . 
  we 're not special snowflake . 
  well russians like their partners to get on their knees , so you can guess . 
  that region you 're speaking of is artificial , has 0 history with russia , while we were sandwiched between poland and russia through almost whole our history as a state . 
  and bulgarians are definitely not turks . 
  the deluge times were actual nightmare , far worse than ww2 by population losses . 
  ethnic lithuanian lands and lapland were last regions in europe to convert to christianity even after that paganism was still prevailing . 
  the only nation that was erased from map was old prussians . 
   actually , from the ordinary man 's point of view ( quality of life , wealth , etc. 
  ) , putin 's rule ( at least from mid-zeroes to the start of the oil crisis ) was one of the best periods in russian history . 
  which is really sad ... 
  i think he 's turk living in uk . 
  germoney ? 
  we got 0 weapons from uk or usa . 
  hmm , til . 
  nightmare . 
  * shivers *, 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  we ask for usa and other nato ally troops to come , they do n't force any base on us . 
  well that 's part of defence budget , is n't it ? 
  nothing , other than spending 2 % on defence . 
  other than our budget for defence . 
  we requested their assistance , they accepted it , end of it . 
  oh trust me , half of europe is actually in love with you .
