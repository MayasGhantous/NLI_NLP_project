  more like we got a chance to choose side . 
  because it was never meant to be a country but part of romania, 
  feels bad man , for real , f * ck ussr and it 's shitty ideology that ruined our economy far too greatly . 
  well we 're part of more `` successful '' stories while talking about ex-commie bloc economy , but our economy is still getting revived by eu even though 25 years passed since fall of ussr . 
  well our bm is cigarettes , dammit belarus , why you so cheap . 
  let 's just unite under tallinn , their government seems know what is best for their small country . 
  well native and english is probably must know in every european country , third language might be optional and depend on your geographical location . 
  you 're disappointed about latvian government yet you do nothing about yours when it 's far worse . 
  russia removed it 's troops because we were screaming for it . 
  we have nato troops because we 're asking for them . 
   why do you think russia will be happy with this ? 
  they would n't , because we actually manage to escape their `` sphere of influence '' . 
   unfortunately , russia can not trust nato . 
  so ironic . 
  i 'm also got banned from that sub-reddit just because i was expressing my views on ussr war crimes . 
  as a white person . 
  i happy to see golden horde [ getting kicked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_blue_waters ) out of ex-kievan rus ' . 
  turkey can into eu now !, 
  do n't forget who [ we are ] ( http://i.imgur.com/catiazi.png ) . 
  5 ~ % our minority is not like latvian or estonian though , maybe because they 're smallest in all of places . 
  so i do n't really care what they listen , we have news shows in russian on tv in evening but they 're rare , but i never watch them since i do n't know russian language and i do n't care . 
  but for estonia and latvia also ukraine it 's big deal , their minorities can be influenced so much that they could start `` civil war '' in a country , i 'm pretty sure you would n't want those `` refugees '' to create militia and get guns out of nowhere . 
  delete your acc already . 
  there is a thing you do n't have , called ethnic russians who were sent here in soviet times . 
  russia is the only one butthurt , for losing all influence , because it 's a total sh * t hole . 
  do n't worry , broliukas will protect you . 
   not enough lebensraum . 
  needs more lebensraum !, 
  you know , in a non-aryan way , seeing how this is before wwi , not even wwii . 
  :d this never had anything to do with aryan anyway , nazis just used it in their propaganda . 
  [ germans always felt that they did n't had enough sun light on their empire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruetmrjbkwi#t=50s ) . 
  yes , i encountered one . 
  he wanted to drink coca-cola before i even bought it in store . 
  and even though drug problem in lithuania is very low , people who spread them are always gypsies , sh * t they appear quite often on tv on shows like `` farai - cops '' or `` tv pagalba - tv help '' . 
  call me stereotypical cunt but i will never , ever trust a gypsy . 
  you 're not romanian , you 're gypsy . 
  mama merkel will take care of her children . 
  i never said that i agree with him . 
  germany would n't want us to lose , we 're part of eurozone , usa would n't want to lose because that would mean end of nato and usa as trustful partner . 
  they already [ questioned ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33325842 ) it . 
  they can suck our d even if they wanted to occupy us . 
  even if they were we would n't be left alone to deal with enemy , there is poland which would scream `` kurwa '' with their tanks coming to our aid . 
  i would call him the lucky one . 
  there is 0 , literally 0 chance that little green men will appear in latvia or estonia , let alone lithuania who 's russian minority is smaller than polish one , our army already made strategic counters against such scenario . 
  ethnic russians who travel to russia from estonia or latvia know exactly how many times their life is better than that of russian . 
  so supporting little green men would literally mean you want hell instead of heaven . 
  how i [ imagine ] ( http://replygif.net/i/147.gif ) them after that . 
  who said i do n't want them to watch me :\\ ^ ), 
  what do you mean ? 
  nato , notable usa troops are stationed here , attacking us will be attacking them . 
   baltic states would lose it . 
  no we would n't because nato and our brother in arms - usa . 
  works for russia . 
  it 's kinkier , they can watch me while i masturbate . 
  i actually find fun in traveling , watching through window and seeing how horizon become more brighter and brighter , all while listening to music . 
  though i hate traveling with low economic trains , because all of `` tun dun dun , tun dun dun '' . 
  why ? 
  no empire think they will ever fall , but they always do . 
  which is sad . 
   misguided view for you . 
  expand on your bs please . 
  turkey is definitely an ally , it 's part of nato for gods sake . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  that 's some cold war mentality still living on . 
  yeah , that 's why we started to expand to south east very fast - from [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png ) to [ this ] ( http://www.jewishgen.org/belarus/newsletter/myvitebskappendices_files/image002.jpg ) , we took ruthenians and even tatars to our army who would get rewarded with land , that 's how [ lipka tatars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars ) appeared . 
  [ not really ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_saule ) . 
  though they were our greatest nemesis till [ battle of grunwald ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_grunwald ) . 
  at that time ethnic lithuanian population was like half a million . 
  not a little , but [ greatly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) . 
  old prussians , never forget !, 
  i do n't understand why people refer to europe as whole when talking about just london or paris ... europe is full of tiny countries , which could give far better view of european culture than those well known places where `` gray mass '' goes . 
   demolish everything except your cool old buildings , take everything valuable that was brought in ( you know , ussr pumped a lot of money to make you a `` showcase of socialism '' ) , leave you with your independence . 
  and what point would that be , to demolish buildings ? 
  even if ussr did n't occupy us we would have built what it 's now , of course it would look a lot better than ugly ass buildings that ussr brought . 
  good thing we getting euromonies and modernizing it . 
  besides ussr did n't brought anything valuable . 
   you know , ussr pumped a lot of money to make you a `` showcase of socialism '' i thought it was eastern germany . 
  and reason why they pumped money in us was because we were n't some shitty states like rest of republics , we were one of the richest if not richest territories before and after occupation of ussr . 
   leave you with your independence . 
  did n't that was what ussr did , first killed our civilians then screamed if you want to independent you wo n't get gas etc. 
  leaving us without any way to use transport and cold flats . 
  ussr what a wonderful country ... fuck anyone who embraces it . 
   sure you do !, 
  as i said most of those people were getting paid by commies and they knew little about `` communism '' that was happening in ussr . 
   hoorah-patriotic volunteers who ready to kill for their beliefs and special forces are not the ones i can call `` innocent '' . 
  yeah you 're right . 
  russians are maniacs who likes to kill . 
   maybe it was , maybe is was not . 
  i just think that when soviets let you go they should 've taken everything they made with them . 
  maybe , including russian population . 
  to take what ? 
  commie blocks ? 
  factories ? 
  how ? 
  it would be rather a real pleasure if they never came here to begin with . 
   just like baltics `` begged '' to join ussr ? 
  please , do n't be ridiculous . 
  [ oh yes we begged our way to usrr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_partisans ) !, 
  those were paid by stalin you know , nazism and communism was out-lawed in interwar lithuania . 
  besides you ca n't compare a totalitarian dictatorship and an alliance .
