  usa did nothing , absolute nothing bad to us , and their base would just ensure stability and peace in our region . 
   russia is evil !, 
   putin is literally hitler !, 
   muh soviet occupation !, 
  which is true , modern russia slowly turning into fascist state , well putin goes by that path , sends innocent russians to die in ukrainian `` civil war '' for god knows what reason . 
  and soviet occupation was terrible , i do n't understand how russians can embrace it when it directly killed millions of you , even almost a million of russians in moscow showed their solidarity against soviet aggression in lithuania . 
   russia needs to be back in 90s !, 
  are n't you already were ? 
  your ruble worth nothing , that 's what you get for being reliant on oil and getting sanctioned for being aggressor on your neighbors . 
   glorious chechen jihadists freedom fighters fought oppressive russian regime !, 
  i do n't know anything about chechen war . 
  but it 's clear to me that both ways russia would bombed them . 
   ukraine is civilized european country and pinnacle of democracy !, 
  well they 're literally russia , oligarchs are ruling country , difference is that ukrainian citizens realized in what hell they 're living while russians still live in delusion while shouting `` glorious russia !, 
  ura ! '', 
   thanks usa for occupation setting your bases in my country !, 
  what bases ? 
  we need to beg for those to happen here you know . 
  besides this summary is not as bad as i seen in russian sub-reddit , there they literally praise ussr for everything and are ignorant of it 's crime . 
  this sub is probably the most civilized when compared to others . 
  keep going , we - people of reddit , love reading bullsh * t. 
  there were no germaniziation for us , protestant religion promoted minority languages in prussia . 
  so it helped us from being russified as our books were legal there and got smuggled into russian empire parts of lithuania . 
  and yes i rather be germanized than rusified or polonized . 
  swedes once [ held ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/swedish_empire_ ( 1560-1815 \\ ) _ en2.png ) a bit of territory in what is today germany . 
  well it stopped polonization and they gave us windows for book smuggling , we shall be in complicated relation with prussia . 
  he says that everywhere . 
  happy independence day !, 
  my pain brother . 
  belarusians were white ruthenia . 
  though lithuanians called it `` gudija '' before soviets shoved white russia into our dictionaries ... 
  they 're ruthenians , not lithuanians . 
  not anymore after ukrainian crisis started to happen . 
  [ belarusian people 's republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belarusian_people%27s_republic ), 
  even kebabs know that . 
  because dictatorship . 
  or use simpler ones like baltic prussians and german prussians . 
  nothing really interesting , damn we 're boring, 
  [ context ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_partisans ) for people who do n't know . 
  your kielbasa will scare them away . 
  i wish we had something like this with poland , instead of one military officer biting other ear off in vilnius/wilno bar . 
  latvians say we talk like drunk latgalians . 
  your words are partially true , i guess . 
  gib us love :(, 
  we were already in their list , since we 're in nato . 
   swedish times best year of my life deluge was literally `` nazi '' times , but i 'll fallow my baltic brother anyway . 
  [ swedish times best times . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ), 
  something like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_medieval_great_powers#/media/file:jagiellonian.png ) ? 
  they 're completely different . 
  watch your back ... 
  when i said russia , i was talking about russian language being shoved into our mouths forcefully . 
  also starting to colonize with russians in non-russian parts , latvia and estonia never had such russian minorities before ussr occupation . 
  1795 last partition of the commonwealth . 
  commonwealth nobles tried to remove your influence with constitution of may ( first in europe and second in the world ) and then you attacked without declaration of war . 
  with other empires , you removed us from map like some cowards . 
  i think he 's paid in euros . 
  bots do n't take rubles anymore . 
  well as some bright minded guy said `` fins are just drunken ewoks '' so i guess estonians are not far from them . 
  only because nazis attacked them , before that they were buddies . 
  i never said serbia is literally russia . 
  serbia used pan-slavism in yugoslavia ( south slavs ) project . 
  i do n't have time to comment 24/7 on reddit tho . 
  soviets should n't be seen in a good light just because they were adversary to nazis . 
  next time also include translation , this is english speaking sub , not russian . 
  only after nazis broke their [ little peace treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov\u2013ribbentrop_pact ) . 
   pan-slavism because only russia and i think serbia to hold their `` slavic brotherhood '' . 
  which even today russians try to use it . 
  you monster . 
  just slap his face with a dildo . 
  pan-slavism . 
  well they 're evolving slower than estonians walk !, 
  so that 's good at least . 
  same boat , brotha . 
  yeah i did knew about reference but when we hear middle lithuania , we get [ flashbacks ] ( http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/5-24-2015/voa1dy.gif ) from it . 
  as lithuanian i can only speak for lithuania . 
  [ uprisings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_uprising#uprising_in_the_former_grand_duchy_of_lithuania ) .

  [ gerualla warfare against soviets for 9 years after ww2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_partisans ) . 
  123 years for lithuania . 
  sure ... 
  but lithuania was always a warrior state . 
  before becoming modern lithuania . 
   peoples of middle-lithuania please do not [ trigger us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_central_lithuania ) . 
  because modern russia fits most of criteria for today 's fascism . 
  i have no idea how world still did n't realize that . 
  green is lithuanian folklore color . 
  do democrats and republicans hate each other so much ? 
  if so can i get eli5 on it why ? 
  not directly maybe , but russia was used to assimilate other non-russian parts . 
  well that 's what happens when your economy is reliant on oil prices while at same time getting sanctioned . 
  because most eu members are also nato members . 
  even if they did n't want to cut off russia themselves would cut them off i assume because as i said , nato . 
  and yes , most countries starting to become less and less reliable on russian energy supply , most notable are us . 
  you can call however you want about usa foreign policy and their military bases but for us , we 're in favor of usa bases here , they have little to no influence in our politics . 
  just because usa have somewhere a military base does n't mean it controls that nation , we have every right to kick them out any time we would want , but we do n't , why ? 
  because we need their presence here , we do n't want to be actually controlled by nation that always acted as adversary to us since xiv c.  it does mean you are under their military umbrella . 
  you make it sound like it 's a bad thing . 
  we 're way too small to defend ourselves but we want to preserve democracy , peace and stability of region , so of course usa presence will not be opposed here , quite contrary , it 's loved .
