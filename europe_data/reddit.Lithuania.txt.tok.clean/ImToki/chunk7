   i wish you luck fending off ttip because screw that stuff !, 
  ttip will fail here as acta did , so i do n't see it was big threat , yet . 
  what point ? 
  most of russian minority in latvia and estonia are ignorant people that cry for not having full citizenship while refusing to meet criteria for it . 
  let alone those who wave soviet flags and are nostalgic for soviet rule ( soviets gave bigger benefits to russians than to native population in non-russian parts of country ) . 
   did you did you stop playing that stupid game of yours and provided your russian minority with citizenship in a non-discriminative fashion ? 
  no , you did n't . 
  are there russians who were born and raised in baltics during soviet times but are deprived of the most basic civil rights like a right to vote ? 
  yes , there are . 
  lithuanian russians are full citizens of lithuania , in latvia and estonia russian minority refuse to learn basics of latvian or estonian languages which prevents them from taking exam for full citizenship , you can not blame estonian or latvians , it 's russian choice , if they do n't like it they can leave and go back to russia , they 're not native population there anyway to begin with . 
   see , that 's why i did n't even consider an option ` or you could stop treating russians like shit ' . 
  i do n't expect much of your countries . 
  `` our commie invader non-citizens are doing fine , and if they are n't it 's nobody 's fault but their own '' . 
  i just have no words on how dumb you 're , you know nothing about russians in baltics . 
  and if you really consider that baltics are oppressing russians you really live in delusional word where putin is your god . 
  would suggest to stop trolling , you 're bad at it . 
  i rather [ die ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tl3qp9p.png ) than live in soviet lithuania . 
  anyway still dreaming about this [ game ] ( http://i.imgur.com/afgymvd.png ) to come out one day . 
  so i could feel pleasure on killing them commies . 
  let 's bring vytis back already on our flag . 
  we already put it everywhere anyway . 
  we can keep tri-color as symbol of freedom and wear it at independence days . 
   best flag - polan . 
  good that we refused to re-create [ plc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_commonwealth#/media/file:chor%c4%85giew_kr%c3%b3lewska_kr%c3%b3la_zygmunta_iii_wazy.svg ) after ww1 . 
  i would rather piss on his picture than talk nice to him . 
   borders we have split by were absolutely arbitrary , there 's a lot of russians in your countries blame soviets for trying to colonize non-russian parts of country . 
   there 's a lot of russians in your countries , you treat them like shit our polish minority is bigger than russian one , and please show me your evidence of our oppression towards russian minority ? 
   hence , there 's a lot of people who would like to secede from the new state they 've found themselves in and join russia . 
  i would laugh my ass off if part of latvia or estonia would secede and become part of russia , that 's literally making your life worse , far worse . 
  minor part , yet russian economy is suffering heavily , ruble worth next to nothing , russians are truly happy now for having crimea . 
  ura !, 
  we will be next really ? 
   what do you mean by polish ? 
  almost all of lithuanian and ruthenian nobility would become part of [ szlachta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szlachta ) . 
  your beloved j. pi\u0142sudski was one of them . 
   and they have spoken ruthenian language ( increasingly also polish and/or bad latin ) . 
  lithuanian dukes were bilingual very least , they spoke both lithuanian and ruthenian , even latin or polish , until union of lublin when it would be completely replaced by polish because of need for becoming part of szlachta . 
  that 's one of the reasons why vilnius region was [ lithuanian ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y5qt965.png ) dominated language before union and after ww1 it was polish speaking . 
  one thing is good is that samogitian nobles did n't stop speaking lithuanian language which gradually slowed full assimilation into polish language and culture . 
   as for `` citizenship '' - they were under lithuanian administration . 
  anyone who lived in gdl and fallowed statutes of lithuania could call himself lithuanian anyway . 
  for e. europe , usa is defending us from russia . 
   we might see poland and the baltics discover what diplomacy means when they do n't have nato backing them up . 
  you mean russian partnership ? 
  one bending the knee other giving orders . 
  that place is already lost , old k\u00f6nigsberg is as dead as old prussians . 
  commonwealth era litwa was rather polish than ruthenian ... why do people assume that just because most of population was ruthenian meant that nobility would also magically become ruthenian ... 
  ukraine , georgia shows otherwise . 
  as landsbergis said `` look what he does , not what he says '', 
  total economic blockade would destroy russia instantly from inside . 
  took crimea , look what 's happening to russian ruble , oil is the only thing that keeps russia 's economy . 
   maybe the overwhelming reliance of nato on us funds is a big problem here . 
  tell us how should we be able to defend ourselves without nato , or usa presence for that matter ? 
  we ca n't guard our air-space we still do n't have money for it , few hundred k 's maximum of our man power against few millions of russia ... 
  i more than happy to see usa and for that matter nato countries here , for helping us to contain peace and stability . 
   one should think that europe could deal with russia alone by now , right ? 
  and then there is nord-stream ii , which completely gives up hope in your european partners . 
   why are you up at 2am ? 
  seriously , though ... ok , maybe they 're not exactly vassal states , but they ** do owe us ** , big time . 
  own us so much that we must give permission to send their back up here and even ask for more military presence . 
  you have no idea what are you talking about when it comes to europeans and usa . 
   remember when the us thought snowden might be on evo morales ' plan i do not support usa , nsa thing but traitor of country is a traitor nonetheless . 
  belarusian was spying over our defense and selling it to minsk or even russia for that he got sentence in jail , do you consider him a good guy ? 
  i doubt . 
   and you can be damn sure they will all sign onto ttip . 
  in your dreams . 
  it would have stayed if it was n't made up just by russia and central asian countries ( they never wanted independence from ussr ) . 
  but we have `` taip '' and `` jo '' ( german loanword ) . 
  litwa can not into commonwealth . 
   i think ** `` ja '' ** and ** `` yes '' ** have a common root . 
  maybe * `` da '' * as well ** yes ** . 
  we also use `` jo '' in everyday conversations instead of `` taip '' . 
  count us in !, 
  `` a ne '' is sarcastic `` oh yeah '' , though it 's true meaning is `` oh no '' in lithuanian . 
   `` ta ne '' whoa make it `` tai , ne '' - `` well no '' , and it will mean same . 
  :o balto-slavic thing intensifies !, 
  yes , not only in finland but also in germany and elsewhere . 
  this is some fucked up situation for europe to deal with . 
  our tourism agencies prefer people to go to turkey than to egypt . 
  well there are many long time ago articles about `` refugees '' leaving finland/germany etc. 
  because of something they did not like . 
  pretty much . 
  if you do n't deserve any hate why would you fear it , do you really think latvians would go knocking to your door step and start beating sh * t out of you , this is not russia where you get killed just because you oppose current regime . 
  putin is supported by very big chunk of russians , it basically become personal cult so it 's more reality than generalization . 
  so you generalize all baltic states ... just because some latvians do n't like you , and not surprised , you 're a kid of colonizers . 
   p.s. 
  i should call my cousins grandpa in siberia and tell him to stop the civil war in ukraine . 
  he should n't have started it . 
  russians support putin , support annexation of crimea and send their own soldiers to die in unnecessary war . 
  so yeah would be great if you called your `` cousins grandpa in siberia '' and tell him to stop being just a work force and help russia to become better place to live , but it 's only dreams now , russian mentality is way too out of that modern european . 
   there 's enough hatred against russians in the baltics i see . 
  oh please , how do you know better than i do . 
  in lithuania nobody gives a damn if you 're russian , as long as you 're fallowing law and not making anyone any problem you can live happily . 
  well latvia has huge russian minority , some of them still stuck with soviet mentality and ukraine has it 's own true reason to hate russians now after they initiated `` civil war '' and illegally annexed crimea . 
  like always was . 
  nope . 
  though we would n't feel any sympathy to kremlin if it would explode one day . 
  if we go so deep we can come to times when russia still did n't exist and was part of kievan rus ' who were raiding our baltic borders . 
  besides you do n't see our occupation good , why should we see soviet occupation good ? 
   should we be butthurt about polish-lithuanian invasion of russia in the 17th century ?
