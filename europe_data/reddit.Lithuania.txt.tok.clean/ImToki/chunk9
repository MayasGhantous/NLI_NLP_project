   https://www.knygos.lt/lt/knygos/musiskiai/ that book was popular topic in tv shows one month ago for your information . 
  nazism is banned here and nobody are glorifying nazis here , they are seen here as animals . 
  besides could you please stop using one evil to hide soviet atrocities ? 
  master race union / s, 
  this . 
  i find it so weird when few people think being gay is bad , and then they just jerking off in their head when they see two girls kissing . 
  your proposed name would make everyone think that vatican is illuminati . 
  because that 's what guy i answered to was talking about . 
  and for fuck sake , soviets did n't do jack shit , they took all those cities for themselves while incorporating them into us just for bigger support from local population . 
  promoted language , yeah right , out side getting russian shoved up your mouth ... 
  so much bs ... you really trying to defend ussr do n't you , there is no taboo , soviets were animals who killed my own family member who fought for lithuanians independence in the invisible front , torturing him insanely before shotting him in the head . 
  any soviet apologist can go jerk himself off on stalin 's picture . 
  i mean their territories spend so much time in one state , it would be crazy to think that they share no similarities what so ever . 
  even poles , lithuanians , belarusians , ukrainians have common with each other , while just being unified for a fraction of time compared to greece and turkey . 
  union of commonwealths , poles would be [ fine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_commonwealth ) with it also . 
  well being lithuanian was also a different case back then , huge expansion made us minority , even though all nobles and grand dukes were ethnic lithuanians before union of lublin we started to slowly adopt polish language and their culture , it was done far quicker after union , so being lithuania could just mean you called yourself such , even though you spoke polish , ruthenian . 
  that 's one of the reasons why some areas where lithuanian language was dominant become dominated by polish language . 
  ei , i hope you do n't count us e. european anymore ? 
  ^ ^ ^ please . 
  still waiting for you to [ take ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) me for forever . 
  well then we should rename our union . 
  whoa , good to be next to you . 
  i 'm pretty sure that our broliukas is just having problems with it 's minority , otherwise it would be next to us also . 
  so canada can join eu ? 
  nice . 
   so we are talking 40ies ? 
  then millions of people died around the world , then european powers still run colonies , when japanese were massacring millions of chinese , yanks dropped nuclear bombs , and germans collecting human fat and hair ? 
  those times were n't sweet for lithuanians also like the rest of the world and got oppressed ? 
  you do n't say !, 
  you 're special kind of blind i guess . 
  could n't you press link i gave earlier on my comments ? 
  it clearly stated mid xix c . when in 1795 russian empire occupied our homeland and began it 's suppression of lithuanians and poles . 
  like being shot , hanged or executed in other way just because you spoke , read , have obtained lithuanian book in latin script . 
  there is a reason mikhail muravyov-vilensky , northwestern krai governor general got nick named as `` hangman of vilnius '' or just `` korikas ( one who hangs others ) '' . 
   who are all those people that populated cities like kaunas then it did n't have significant ethnic lithuanian population before soviets arrived , yet by the 90ies kaunas was virtually 100 % lithuanian : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaunas#demography or vilnius were lithuanians made minority before arrival of soviets and ended up as a majority there before the soviets left , or klaipeda with similar picture . 
  because [ nazis and soviets ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mnoojti.png ) killed or deported them . 
  i can agree on this . 
  when i think of turkey or turks i think them being similar to greeks , out side religion . 
  you realize how much time it would take for finally turkey reaching eu standards to join eu ? 
  by that time isis should be just a piece of history already . 
  cyprus is n't on european continent either . 
   are we talking the 1940-1950 period here or 80ies ? 
  answer is clearly in your eyes , but you missed it . 
   the most painful statistic for current lithuania vs lssr is the ethnic lithuanian demographics where population increased by 200,00 every 10 year , now you have ethnic lithuanians decrease of 400,000 every 10 years . 
  maybe that 's because nobody was free to leave the country ? 
  also russians were getting brought here on newly built commie blocks . 
  while now we are part of schengen area and are not getting colonized by soviets/russians . 
  i 'm living in reality , eu is one of the best things happened to europe . 
  there is no way eu can fall , only evolve now . 
  that `` if '' is impossible to be done in any way . 
  no way eu will fall apart , only some countries may leave it . 
  well they can dream what ever they want , we do n't want to be part of that dream . 
  wait for old guard to die off , then it will only get better . 
  well that 's because russification policies were literally harsh as hell , nobody wanted to learn russian , but your native tongue was banned , especially if it 's written in latin script . 
  so people could only read books that would [ smuggled ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) from german prussia ( thanks for being protestant < 3 ) . 
  because your country is already literally mordor ? 
  so you have nothing else to do out side watching others suffer ? 
  do us a favor and visit nearest mental hospital , thank you . 
  well at least now we can go together as in [ old times ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nnopv3i.jpg ) , heh ? 
  in lithuania , no . 
  our russian minority is too small and irrelevant , we have more problems with polish minority than russian one , but those problems are very minor . 
   friendship of nations worked more or less triggered . 
   if anything it lost a bit more than half ** their ** population . 
  poor choice of word . 
  more likely it has to do with reversing polonization and russification . 
  literally every european nation just wants to prosper peacefully , even belarus try to avoid any conflicts in the name of their people , but i just can not understand mentality of russians , they 're like from other world . 
  well i guess i can into being j. pi\u0142sudski now ... 
  so from my mothers side i 'm partly polish ? 
  russia suggest otherwise , it 's the only nation in europe to be happy on going wars with neighbors . 
  that guy is just `` feeling bombardment '' ^ ^ `` junta '' ^ ^ is ^ ^ a ^ ^ slang ^ ^ for ^ ^ - ^ ^ `` feel '' ^ ^ in ^ ^ lithuanian ^ ^ langauge . 
  they should just move here or to poland , motherfuckers deserve their spot here . 
  eternal allies . 
  do you live in africa ? 
  because that 's not how modern europe works . 
  alone ? 
  ussr was n't made just by russia . 
   alliance with lithuania would n't be worth [ feelsbadman ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/015/723/838.jpg ), 
  but loved commonwealth ? 
  did n't you ? 
  since we are allies again you can borrow from us . 
  he completely fucked up when it came to making friendly alliance . 
  had dream , crushed it by his own greediness . 
  we know you just dream about restoration of commonwealth and then intermarium . 
  you tell us . 
   du ** t ** chy ... are you trying to trigger me ? 
   capacity for liberal reform as the commonwealth , which later used that capacity to impose the tough anti-persecution laws during the reformation wars for your information grand duchy and the crown had separate laws . 
   secondly , the dutchy was helpless against muscovites , ottomans and sweden . 
  it would n't survive without a union with poland . 
  we become helpless against muscovites when last grand duke of lithuania died and king of poland become the only ruling monarch of two states , it gave clear window for grand principality of muscovites to grow out of proportion as no attention was put in east . 
  not going to start about ottomans they were n't the reason why we formed a unified state . 
  swedes did n't even exist as threat to us at that time , wtf are you talking about . 
   it would n't survive without a union with poland . 
  of it would n't , the same way poland would n't have survived either . 
  we were not repressed , though our language and culture was slowly getting erased by self-polonization as it meant to achieve more power ... to the point that we would just become another polish province . 
  yes we had no choice but to from an alliance with you and later unified state , but this would n't had happened if were was n't any threat from east , even at commonwealth times we tried to break out of commonwealth in `` deluge '' times , to form a state with swedes rather than to keep with you . 
  do you honestly believe we would become `` ruthenised '' , all grand dukes spoke lithuanian mainly and ruthenian as secondary . 
  there was 0 chance for us to lose our language . 
  [ 200 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_language#/media/file:lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png ) with ruthenia nothing changed , 200 with poland and almost half of lithuanian proper becomes polish speakers . 
  even then samogitian nobles who had biggest autonomy in grand duchy spoke lithuanian mainly in commonwealth times . 
  i never said that , that should influence our relationship nowadays .
