  good , at last somebody in europe have the balls to stand up against the islamic extremism.yet in this thread , people are not happy about it.it shows how far are the liberals willing to bend over to the religion wich does n't give a fuck about basic human rights . 
   wilno from us the two months before . 
  what?during world war i , vilnius and the rest of lithuania was occupied by the german army from 1915 until 1918 . 
  the act of independence of lithuania , declaring lithuanian independence from any affiliation to any other nation , was issued in the city on 16 february 1918 . 
  after the withdrawal of german forces , the city was briefly controlled by polish self-defence units which were driven out by advancing soviet forces . 
  vilnius changed hands again during the polish-soviet war and the lithuanian wars of independence : it was taken by the polish army , only to fall to the soviet forces again . 
  shortly after its defeat in the battle of warsaw , the retreating red army , in order to delay the polish advance , ceded the city to lithuania after signing the soviet-lithuanian treaty on 12 july 1920 . 
  [ 12 ] before that , it was part of russian empire , and not poland , before that it was part of commonwhealth , and before that it was part of ldk . 
  also : '' in most cases historians tend to summarise the issue by saying that the agreement assigned vilnius to lithuania and polish attack violated it ''  wilno the name of the city originated from the vilnia river . 
  [ 2 ] the name of the river derives from the lithuanian language word vilnis ( `` a surge '' ) or vilnyti ( `` to surge '' ) . 
  the city has also been known by many derivate spellings in various languages throughout its history it 's vilnius , not wilno, 
   wilno and lw\u00f3w were polish cities before end of ww2 that because poland annexed it after the ww1 . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suwa%c5%82ki_agreement the most controversial issue -- the future of the city of vilnius -- was not explicitly addressed . 
  when the agreement was signed , vilnius was garrisoned by lithuanian troops and behind the lithuanian lines . 
  [ 25 ] [ 26 ] yet this changed almost immediately when the staged \u017beligowski 's mutiny began on october 8 . 
  soon after the mutiny , l\u00e9on bourgeois , president of the council of the league of nations , expressed strong disapproval , asserting that \u017beligowski 's actions were a violation of the engagements entered into with the council of the league of nations , and demanding the immediate polish evacuation of the city . 
  [ 27 ] '' in pi\u0142sudski 's view , signing even such a limited agreement was not in poland 's best interests , and he disapproved of it . 
  [ 21 ] in a 1923 speech acknowledging that he had directed \u017beligowski 's coup , pi\u0142sudski stated : `` i tore up the suwa\u0142ki treaty , and afterwards i issued a false communique by the general staff . 
  '' [ 2 ] \u017beligowski and his mutineers captured vilnius , established the republic of central lithuania , and after a disputed election in 1922 , incorporated the republic into poland . 
  [ 28 ] the conflict over the city dragged on until world war ii . 
  in the 21st century , the vilnius region ( wile\u0144szczyzna ) is the major center of the polish minority in lithuania . 
  [ 29 ] '' '' in most cases historians tend to summarise the issue by saying that the agreement assigned vilnius to lithuania and polish attack violated it . '', 
   by the beginning of 20th century it 's ethnic composition was mostly polish with large jewish minority , and little to no lithuanians . 
  in a period between 1918 and 1921 it has changed hands between germans , poles , bolheviks , poles , bolsheviks , lithuanians and poles again . 
  so much for the alleged `` polish occupation '' .

  [ 29 ] '' sure not a occupation buddy.definetly not / s it does n't matter what the ethnic make up was at the time , what matters is that vilnius was part of lithuania , and you broke agreement to wich your goverment agreed to . 
  yep , uk was depicted perfectly . 
  you 're totally not racist yourself ... / s, 
  can i add mak\u0161tava ( from word mak\u0161tis ) - vagina ` ava ? 
  whenever i pass that village , i giggle . 
  did i say that you support nazis or isis?no.i just gave you an example , that certain symbols are already banned in certain european countries.don ' t be rude . . 
  go and walk with a neo-nazi flag , and see how well that goes for you.freedom of speech my ass.isis flag should be forbidden just like a nazi flag . 
  if he 's a citizen of the european country , then yes , his opinion matters.if he is a australian citizen living in europe , his opinion does n't mattter . 
  the fairest way is just send them back from where they came from , if they refuse to state their country of origin , just send them to the middle of sahara.it 's not eu business to deal with them . 
   request asylum who are genuine refugees i agree on that . 
   you 're obligated to do under domestic and international laws . 
  let 's be honest here , very few cares about the international laws nowadays , and un ca n't do shit about it.un is a joke and you know it.and acording to the same law , refugees must apply for asylum seekers status in the first safe country ... wich their ignore and usually go for yurop.so if they can ignore the international law , why we ca n't ? 
   just spread them across europe evenly and sort their situation out , we can deal with it . 
  no thanks , they are not our problem.we should n't accept any of them.send them back.enough is enough . 
  so what?there are milions of them , actually tens of millions.what we are supposed to do?accept all of them ? 
  ? you 're australian anyway , why do you care ? 
  go to / r/australia and complain about abotts stance on illegal immigration, 
  ask for tinginys as well , preferably home made one if possible . 
  i do n't mind \u0160akotis , it 's not bad ( altough a bit dry ) , but i only eat it on the special occasions ( weddings , birthdays etc. 
  ) . yeah but i agree with you skruzd\u0117lynas is like a piece of heaven , i would kill somebody for some glorious skruzd\u0117lynas right now . 
  edit : forgot how to spell skruzd\u0117lynas . 
  also [ tinginys ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_e9m6zj41ke/tvegl4eldoi/aaaaaaaaade/wfwpxf7hwwu/s1600/giedres+blogas+184.jpg ) how could i forgot about the lazy one.so simple and delicious . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2bcb4p/if_you_had_us_citizenship_would_you_pay_for_eu/cj48ddq he is american of russian decent . 
  except you know , on this instance , they will have to prove , that they 're being prosecuted in their home country.ofcourse if they did n't destroyed their passports already . . wich usually what happens . 
  cool , now fuck off . 
  so until they claim asylum , they are illegals , because you know , that takes time.gotcha . 
  there are legal ways to get into the country , and there is illegal.therefore , they are illegal immigrants , until/if granted asylum.there is no need for court to decide , they got into italy by the illegal means . 
  in the uk it costs anywhere between 40-70 pounds ( depends on the quality and a dealer ) hardly expensive . 
  how old are you?ten ? 
  i agree with you.once we slept 4 friends in a double bed ,2 girls and 2 guys.it really depends on the situation and circumstances ... if there is no options or options are limited ( in example : only blankets available and no matresses ) . 
  in other words it 's not weird * * depends on the situation . 
  it 's a germany 's responsability too ... 
  build a ramp from a magazine or something like that.take two eggs , roll the first one , then the next person ( can be many people as you want ) . after everyone rolled their first one , roll the second one and try to hit as many other eggs as possible ( also you can put some sweets , chocolate etc. 
  on the '' field '' ) . if you hit an egg or something else you can claim it as your own and eat it or whatever.oh also , a second egg wich you roll , can not be taken from you.and after every roll you have to take it out of the field . 
  and also there is a general rolling , in wich you compete in distance only . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egg_tapping - this is kinda tradion , before you start to eat food , you first take a desired egg from the basket and compete with your family members who have the strongest egg . 
  sounds nice , i have no idea why we do n't do it.although we usually play games like a egg rolling contest , checking who have the strongest egg etc. 
  egg-hunt ? 
  what 's that?we do n't do this kind of thing . 
  actually , i do understand quite a bit of russian language.and anyway mr_vladimir_putin is a bot who reposts top youtube comments . 
  haha ... :( dictator handbook trick.if asked an uncomfortable question , just say it 's a provocation ... all the money goes into st.peter and moscow . 
  ban this useless bot from here . 
  yes , more negative.i was never a fan of the russian goverment , usa or any big country in general , but now i have more dislike for russia.and most of all , russian population seems to be either pro-putin or very quiet ( very few pro-ukraine or anti-war protests ) . 
  ahh i misunderstood.i thought you were implying that brits of the chinese ethnicity are all einstains or smthg.sorry my bad . 
  have you even read this article?it 's about foreign chinese students ... 
  as an ethnic lithuanian i would like to know how do you identify yourself vasari ? 
   dog language seriously ? 
  ? fucking hell mate , your grandparents are ignorant . 
   do you know who is supplying the gas for it ( i havent been able to find supplier info ) ? 
  or is it a `` if you build it they will come '' situation ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_lng_terminals#existing_liquefaction_terminals it works like a market , lowest bidder wins . 
  by the end of this year lithuania will have a lng terminal so it 's something . 
  serious question , why do spain accept them?just put 'em on the plane and send back to their country of origin.europe have too many people already , many young people are still unemployed ... wtf . . and why border guards do n't disperse them with rubber bullets , gas canisters and shock grenades ? 
  it 's strange when riot police can use that shit on it 's own citizens , but not on illegal immigrants . 
  lithuania , hungary , japan , koreas , mongolia , iran . 
  am i right ? 
  i do n't blame russia , i did n't blame anyone.i just pointed out , that diversification is a good thing , and you started shouting stuff at me . 
  what would you prefer to have : three supermarkets in your town who compete with each other for your money , or 1 supermarket who can do whatever it wants , and you still have to buy from it because there is n't any alternatives.think about it . 
  i know kilirica , but do n't understand shit past ` idi naxui ' , ` kak dyla ' and ` sosi xuj ' . 
  so , yes i can read it , but i ca n't understand shit what i 'm reading.you know why?because i was born in free lithuania , and could n't be bother to learn it properly.i do regret it a little bit , because a different perspective sometimes is nice as long as it is n't a propaganda . 
  whatever dude , i would gladly pay 20-30 % more for the gas , than give a penny to your oligarchs with putin in the front . 
  also your source looks hysterical.what those apes , asian dudes , whales and dinosours have to do with the lng.post a proper source in english and not some shit from livejournal wich is ridden with propaganda type shit .
