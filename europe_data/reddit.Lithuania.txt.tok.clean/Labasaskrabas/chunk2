  and again stop being so mad about it , it 's not like i 'm attacking you personally and stuff . 
  diversification bro , have you ever heard of it?we 're sick and tired of relying solely on garseprom and putin.at least we will have an option - the moment your putkin decides to turn of the gas for whatever reason . 
  believe me i feel that sarcasm from you , do n't be so angry . 
  countries that export lng ( start up date of earliest liquefaction terminal is in parentheses . ), 
  algeria , republic of ( 1971 ) australia , commonwealth of ( 1989 ) brunei ( darussalam ) , state of ( 1972 ) equatorial guinea , republic of ( 2007 ) egypt , arab republic of ( 2004 ) indonesia , republic of ( 1977 ) libya ( also known as the socialist people 's libyan arab jamahiriya ) ( 1970 ) malaysia ( also known as persekutuan tanah malaysia ) ( 1983 ) nigeria , federal republic of ( 1999 ) norway , kingdom of ( 2007 ) oman , sultanate of ( also known as saltanat uman ) ( 2000 ) qatar , state of ( also known as dawlat qatar ) ( 1997 ) trinidad and tobago , republic of ( 1999 ) united arab emirates ( also known as al imarat al-arabiyah al-muttahidah ) ( 1977 ) united states of america ( 1969 ) source : http://www.energy.ca.gov/lng/international.html, 
  you know , there is more countries who can deliver the gas than qatar.also lithuania will have it 's own gas terminal by the end of this year.ruskie do n't be mad.diversification is always a good thing . 
   also people living there speak a language ( tutejszy , \u0422\u0443\u0442\u044d\u0439\u0448\u044b\u044f , tutejsi - `` local '' in english ) that no one understand , just like portuguese . 
  except the fact that almost nobody speaks it in proper vilnius.yeah sure some old rural people outside of vilnius do speak it , but that 's about it . 
  we 're working on it . 
  ; / it 's much better than it use to be , but still we have a lot of idiots , who act '' cool '' and do n't put their seat belt on , or use an '' excuse '' , wich goes something like '' car have 4 wheels not 2 , so i 'm safe '' . most of those deaths are from stupid arseholes like that ... who not only endanger themselves , but also everyone else . 
  edit : and also drunk drivink it 's quite a big issue over here . 
  no mate that 's yours bloody lorry drivers on our roads . 
   hen a crisis in syria happens , and boom we get 16000 more than planned , what?your freakin ' goverment flat out offered asylum for every syrian who will manage to come . 
  and now you 're complaining that the rest of the europe do n't pull the weigh or some nonsense.blame your goverment instead . 
  not wanting uneducated , poor forgeiners who only can speak their own language ( and maybe some of them english ) = stomfront.haha.eastern europe have a shitload of social and economic problems alrready.we have a lot poor/unemployed people , we do n't really need any refugees . 
  it 's swedens fault for granting asylum to everyone . 
  more realistic variant is : moldova latvia/estonia lithuania poland/finland . 
  say thanks to the pc shit.hey guise let 's discuss if can use the word immigrant to refer immigrants or not ? 
  ( despite the fact that russia is banging their weapons ) ... peace - yeah fucking sure . 
  as a lithuanian , i really hope this ukraine stuff will bring closer ties between the lt and pl.both of our countries know what is like live under the russian rule , aside our disagreemnts on ethnic minority questions and all that , we are still closer than anything . 
  ** as a second language ** i do '' speak '' russian as well , i can read ( and do n't understand shit outside some generic phrases ) , and speak ( like kak dyla ( how are you ) or idi naxui ( go fuck yourself ) ... 
  ethnic lithuanians make up about four-fifths of the country 's population and lithuania has the most homogenous population in the baltic states . 
  according to the 2011 census , the population of lithuania stands at 3,043,400 , ** 84.1 % of whom are ethnic lithuanians who speak lithuanian ** , which is the official language of the country . 
  several sizable minorities exist , such as poles ( 6.6 % ) , russians ( 5.8 % ) , belarusians ( 1.2 % ) and ukrainians ( 0.5 % ) . 
  well we have also finland and sweden even tho they couple years ago promised ( despite their neautralism ) to help us out.also there is a nato one of the most important rules wich goes by : if you attack one of the nato countries , you attack all of them.and if nato do not react , basically it 's the end of the nato . 
  as a lithuanian ( we are the majority 84 % ) i prefer nationalist over any communist.you know why?because the fucking soviets were fucking socialist slash communist.go fuck yourself . 
  because we are seen as neo-nazi/fa \u0161isti.and i think it 's a good thing , we have only 1 city/town wich is russian majority and it 's surrounded by rural lithuanian villages.don ' t get me wrong half of my extended family is ethnically russian , but we get along fine , and most of them barely can speak proper russian.latvia and estonia on other hand should have more worries than us . 
  russian parliament is a joke.russia is basically ruled by the one man , and parliament will agree on everything what putin says or do . 
   the only people who have been chased away from the protest have been liberals and trade unionists . 
  could provide any source on that ? 
   they are n't all fascists , just most do you have a source on that?or are you pulling that out of your arse ? 
  if i can cross the border without needing to show my passport , i should be able to cross the border without needing to buy a prepaid sim.i mean if i want to travel across the eu , why the fuck i have to buy a sim in every country just to use a basic thing like the internet . 
   national interests trump eu interests , that 's the bottom line , and i support that , otherwise do explain to me why a nation even exists ? 
  i agree on that.if swiss want to fuck their ecenomy up.they 're free to do so.next logical step for the eu is just terminate all the current treaties with the switzerland and renegiotiate in favor for the eu ( like tax import from the switzerland , visas for the swiss citizents , set border controls etc. 
  ) . after all eu is the biggest trading parter of swiss republic . 
  same way there is russian neonazi .

  do you eat meat ? 
  hmm.i think we should wait and see.there is nothing else we can do . 
   you and me , are just speculating . 
  well , right now for the eu as a whole is much more important to prove a point.there is a big number of eurosceptics who will watch the outcome of this situation very closely.do you really think , that the swiss can do whatever the fuck they want , and get all the benefits from the eu , whilst loosing nothing?why bother and try to scare your country with some little pressure , when we can use full power ? 
  that , or eu will be happy to drive around your alps and give a economic boost to the surrounding countries . 
   or they 'll just negotiate an associate agreement as replacement , continue trading with the single market , but now set their own immigration limits . 
  why would eu agree with that?eu as a whole is in much better position right now , than the swiss.i fucking hope , that eu will use it 's power to fuck switzerland up big time . 
   free trade between the eu and switzerland is mutually beneficial swiss have more to loose than the eu.much more ... 
  false ... `` gamow later claimed that his first two attempts to defect with his wife were in 1932 , and involved trying to kayak : first a planned 250-kilometer paddle over the black sea to turkey , and another attempt from murmansk to norway .

  i have n't seen an olympic park in any of these photos ... it 's just flats and some sidewalks and rubbish ... 
  man , you 're fucked up in your head ... you should visit a doctor or something.i 'm worried for you . 
  speak for yourself you dirty eastern european . 
  yeah soon there will be a quite sizeable ethnic swedish minority . 
  who knows man ... ; /, 
  why?if you do n't like it , just downvote and move on.as a guy who likes languages/history ( that sort of thing ) i would like to see more maps like that.plus discussion in the comments , with explanations why certain country is named the way it is , is well educational . 
  ahh , sorry mate , i did n't intended to offend you that 's why i deleted it.i use to work with couple guys from romania and every second word they had said was pula . 
  sorta.we do have lithuanian swear words wich have a larger impact , like bybys ( dick , and variations of that ) , pisti ( vulgar fuck and variations of that ) , kale/kekse ( bitch ) and some others wich i 'm not gon na to name , because i 'm on my mobile phone.although lithuanian swear words are gaining more and more popularity and little by little they 're pushing foreigns words out of use , but that will take a very long time . 
  that 's why and probably different social circles have something to do as well . 
   english i have never heard a lithuanian to swear in english outside of the internet/or when he speaks in english . 
  i 'm from lithuania and i have never heard about \u017demai\u010di\u0173 ( samogitian ) separatist movement.it might be true , but it 's probably very , very small ... 
   this post , in particualar the choice of a picture for representing life in vilnius [ 2 ] , has attracted some attention from lithuanian media and has caused a slight stir on facebook . 
  well yeah , because it 's a dumb photo , sad but dumb nonetheless.you can find drug addicts all over the world living in similar or worse conditions . 
   haha that photo from lithuania , yep this is how it is there , make no attempts at tourism . 
  :d not sure if joking , or for real ... edit : ahh , he 's joking.i feel stupid now . 
  honestly i ca n't think of any word related to dievas wich would mean sky or something related . 
   just for reference , sky in latvian is ` debesis ' . 
  heh in lithuanian ` debesis ' means a cloud and the sky is dangus ( comes from word ` dengti ' to cover ) . 
  you 're missing a key point.she was n't asked to move.she was asked if she wanted to move.the people were treating her favourably so she would n't be pestered by sexists for wearing a miniskirt . 
  you 're missing a key point.he wasnt asked to move.he was asked if he wanted to move.the people were treating him favourably so he would n't be bothered by the homophobes for being gay . 
  you 're missing a key point.she was n't asked to move.she was asked if she wanted to move.the people were treating her favourably so she would n't be pestered by the people for wearing hijab . 
  do n't you fucking see how stupid you sound ? 
  first of all it 's bullshit , if media did n't get involved , the '' spokesman '' and that hospital would n't give a fuck.second of all , your qoute indicates that it 's not the first time this shit happened.what 's that mean , that there was some fucknut who did n't like a person in the military uniform one time , and it happened the second time . 
  now ask yourself , if the girl in a miniskirt was in hospital and the staff have asked her to move because she offends some people , would that be right ?? 
  ? if a muslim girl wearing a niqab was told to move to a separate room , would that be right ?? 
  ? why the fuck europeans have to deal with all that niqab/hijabi stuff and be tolerant , while a person in the military uniform have to be moved in case he offends somebody.imagine the uproar if a muslim girl was told to move to a different room , because her hijab offends someone . 
  do you have any proof of that or you are speaking out of your ass?or it 's the case of good ol' : '' if there is problem anywhere in the world blame americans/america ... 
  honestly , yeah it could be those groups , but you and me both know that 's ** most ** likely not the case and the army guy was moved so not to '' offend '' a certain religious group.obviuosly i got no evidence for that , but if a hospital moved the man to somehwere else due to hippie or pacifist complaining the about unifrom i 'm sure that bbc would mention that . 
   a hospital has apologised after an raf sergeant was moved away from other patients because staff said his uniform might cause offence . 
  hmm i really do wonder what group of people would be offended by the military uniform in the uk ... . this bullshit really getting out of hand in the western europe where you have to be careful not to offend certain people for something as wearing military uniform or making a joke , movie or drawing a picture ... 
   i understand your sentiment , but for example in lithuanian avis means sheep and avinas ( derrived from word avis ) - ram , in your language ram - oinas , in latin sheep - ovis and in finnish sheep - lammas.so it 's sorta clear that you have borrowed ` oinas ' from somewhere and linguists look fro closest match . 
  i 'm no linguist , but those words have an proto-baltic/indo european roots not the fino-ugric ones.yes it possible , but not with these words specifically.some linguist would probably explain better to you . 
  thanks . 
  you can compare i have added a lithuanian version and it 's pretty much the same with only minor diff . 
  can `` keli '' mean road conditions?because i googled it and there was second/older meaning.because kelias in lithuanian means road . 
  i gon na translate it when i 'll be at home it gon na take 2-3 hours i will send a pm to you , but honestly it would be quicker and easier for you to just to use the lithuanian-english dictionary or google translate ( lithuanian version is in the brackets ) . to be fair not all words mean the same thing in both languages so i can only translate the lithuanian part , but it not nessesary means the same in finnish language . 
  translation here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mbwy2/the_word_for_gold_in_various_european_languages/cvdstfl, 
  edit : i have added a translation to lithuanian words . 
  for comparison translation for finnish words : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mbwy2/the_word_for_gold_in_various_european_languages/cvdvl8t note : keli in finnish can mean also - road conditions . 
  actually you have borrowed quite a few proto-baltic words including keltainen.more examples : keli ( in finnish it means wheather , but also ` road conditions ' ) ( kelias - road , ) , silta ( tiltas - bridge ) , ratas ( ratas - wheel ) , pirtti ( pirtis - bathhouse/sauna ) , sein\u00e4 ( siena - wall ) , reki ( rog\u0117s - sleigh/sled ) , terva ( derva - tar ) paimen ( piemuo - shepherd ) , tarha ( dar\u017eas - garden , dar\u017eelis means kindergarden/small garden ) , jyv\u00e4 ( javai - cereal as in type of grain ) , herne ( \u017eirnis - pea ) , ruis ( rugys - type of grain rye ) , vaha ( va\u0161kas - wax ) , vuota ( oda - skin/hide ) , hihna ( \u0161ik\u0161na - harness/strap for horses made of hide/skin ) , porsas ( par\u0161as - male pig ) , oinas ( avinas - ram ) , vuohi ( o\u017eys - male goat ) , mets\u00e4 ( med\u017eiai - trees ) , kirves ( kirvis-axe ) , perkele ( perk\u016bnas - thunder/god of thunder ) , keltainen ( geltonas - yellow ) , herhil\u00e4inen ( \u0161ir\u0161\u0117-hornet / wasp ) , lohi ( la\u0161i\u0161a - salmon ) , sisar ( sesuo - sister ) , tyt\u00e4r ( dukt\u0117 - daughter ) , harmaa ( \u0161irmas - grey usually old horse/greyish ) , laiva ( laivas - ship ) , kauha ( kau\u0161as - scoop/dipper ) . 
  there is about 1,1 percent of baltic words in your language . ~ ~ i 'm on the phone and to lazy to translate every one of them to english for non balts and non suomi . 
   ~ ~ edit : not all words mean the same thing in both languages , but it usually have a related meaning . 
  apparently we got a word \u017eeltas it means yellowish/blond , but it 's mainly fallen from use.http : / / www.zodynas.lt/terminu-zodynas/zz/zeltas also word ' \u017eeltas ' is related to a lithuanian word geltonas ( yellow ) and to latvian ` dzeltens ' ( yellow ( ? ),
