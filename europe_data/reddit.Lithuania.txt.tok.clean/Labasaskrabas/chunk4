  tell that to hungarians . 
  more multiculturalism obviously ... 
   i 'm genderqueer wtf is that supposed to mean ? 
  a lot lithuanians have surnames ending `` vi\u010d '' , `` auskas '' ( owski ) etc due to polinization , russification decades/hundreds years ago.it does n't really mean anything . 
   just saying and as a lithuanian you should be aware of that lol :d, 
  well mickiewicz is a polish version of lithuanian surname mickevi\u010dius ... 
   google it , retard well are n't you a nice fella ? 
   because if i changed the title it would be removed ? 
  then do n't post it.find a better article with a better title and post that . 
  nahh i think at this point it 's already #illridewithyou or #noislamophobia or something similar ... 
  even in / r/europe i ca n't escape bernie sanders related posts . 
  top kek, 
  you 're speaking out of your ass.the posh accent nowadays is the way lithuanian news announcers are speaking.very few people speak like that in the real world . 
  that means united kingdom . 
  maybe you should do some reading instead of spouting bullshit?she invited them on more than one occasion , also she said that there is no limits on refugees . 
  http://news.sky.com/story/1547326/germany-no-limit-to-refugees-well-take-in just fucken google it and you will find countless articles about merkels stance on refugees . 
  haha omfg you 're delusional.huge chunk of the economic refugees are n't even syrian ... this influx of illegals only gon na increase with all that climate change , high birth rates in africa , and wars ... a lot of these so called refugees are just opportunists who have nothing to lose so they just go to europe because they have heard that money grows on trees here and europeans want them here ( thanks merkel ) . 
  shoes off , leave them by the door do n't worry i will give you slippers to wear if you 're not comfortable just walking in your socks . 
  wash your feet with soap , change socks everyday and take your goddamn shoes off when you 're at home.they smell because you 're wearing them all day long everyday . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35250344 bbc reporting that he was shouting allah ackbar before being shot . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35250344 well bbc reporting that he was shouting allah ackbar and it 's charlie hebdo anniversary so i doubt it that it 's a suicide by cop . 
  she sounds like somebody from marijampol\u0117 or close to marijampol\u0117 , bet there is more than one subdialect of suvalkie\u010di\u0173 dialect.parts of kaunas is infact in suvalkijos region.i 'm from jonava and everybody here speaks basically standard lithuanian , except when shortening trisde\u0161imt , dvide\u0161imt we say tram , dvam isntead of trim , dvim . 
  lol :d why i do n't know :d, 
  really?well i live close to kaunas and everybody speaks standard lithuanian at least it sounds like standard lithuanian to me and i do n't notice any differences between the way ethnic lithuanians from vilnius speak and those from kaunas . 
   which happens to be similar to accent from around vilnius actually standard lithuanian language was based on dialect from suvalkija ( close to kaunas ) and not vilnius . 
  yeah i agree with you.you can easily tell who is from ma\u017eeikiai or \u0160iauliai or kaunas.i always make fun of a friend from \u0160iauliai because he often do not pronounce letter `` a '' at the end of the words like darbas , labas , stalas etc. 
  and it becomes darbs , labs , stals . 
  wtf?i mean i know that in general turks and greeks do n't like each other that very much and there is rivarly and so on.but ca n't you keep quiet for a minute , especially since that minute of silence is for the entirely different country . 
   principles of our liberal democracies , ** including ** our novel notions about sexual equality you are missing a point , it 's not only about the sexuality or gay rights but also about our way of life in general and our values ( freedom of religion , democracy , freedom of thought , equality and so on ) the things europeans west and east fought for and died for . 
   principles of our ** liberal democracies ** , ** including ** our novel notions about sexual equality you are missing a point , it 's not only about the sexuality but also about our way of life in general and our values ( freedom of religion , democracy , freedom of thought , equality etc. ), 
  the things europeans west and east fought for and died for . 
   it is doubtless true to say that the overwhelming majority of muslims in europe are not violent . 
  but it is also true that the majority hold views not easily reconciled with the principles of our liberal democracies , including our novel notions about sexual equality and tolerance not merely of religious diversity but of nearly all sexual proclivities . 
  and it is thus remarkably easy for a violent minority to acquire their weapons and prepare their assaults on civilisation within these avowedly peace-loving communities . 
   `` romans before the fall '' , wrote ward-perkins , `` were as certain as we are today that their world would continue for ever substantially unchanged . 
  they were wrong . 
  we would be wise not to repeat their complacency . '', 
   effectively : the terrorists attacks actually saved more people than they killed . 
  wow.i am done with you.i have no words ... 
   there have been way more deaths related to christianity in west and north europe even in this past decade than those related to islamism . 
  source?back your statement up or fuck off . 
   but obviously , the main danger here is islamism , well it 's a danger.just couple days ago over 100 innocent people died.and many more before that . 
   simple : that it is not a valid argument that because they murdered , they were less french ( it would be a textbook example of no true scotsman , as said ) . 
  therefore , i keep my original point that the majority of these terrorists were french , not refugees . 
  yeah they were french by citizenship.that 's it.but in reality they hated france and it 's values , a lot of muslims in western europe do not indentify as europeans , or french , german or whatever , they in fact put their faith first and they hate the western world and everythin it 's stands for and i got a feeling that you hate the western world as well . 
  well i have no desire to argue with a terrorist supporter.so i gon na block you and ignore you . 
   feel free to downvote me as much as you want without exposing your reasons !, 
  thanks . 
  downvoted . 
  wtf is wrong with you dude ? 
  are you seriously this stupid?he said , that blowing yourself and killing innocent people is not a french value wich is true.murder is not a basis of any modern european country.what are you trying to do here ? 
  ? are you trying to argue that murder is a french valueare you trying to argue that islamism is not a danger to europe ? 
  nah mate i 'm not extreme.you are the extreme delusional radical far leftists here.you honestly sound like one of those conspiracy nuts ... was a 9/11 inside job as well?honestly i woulnd ' t be suprised if you said so ... you use a lot of big words , but your sentences mean nothing for the most part ... 
  yeah ... you sure like to use big words ... yeah the terrorist guy had a syrian passport , he killed a lot of people.that 's the bottom line.most of the refugees have crossed bunch of safe countries to get to europe , but uh oh poor refugees are suffering because of the racist europeans . 
  ** no most of the refugees are not terrorist ** , but even if 1 out of 10 thousand , or even 1 out of 50 thousand is , there is a huge fucking problem . 
   the point is that europe will not collapse because of this crisis , this is low brow , populistic fearmongering at it 's best . 
  are you sure.the stream of migrants wo n't magically stop , and in fact probably increase in the upcoming years.this will not be pretty ...  the point is that europe and the west overall have direct and indirect responsibillity for the problems that challenge us now . 
  ohh gotcha.it 's our fault after all . 
  you far left radicals are sure fucking delusional . 
  what 's your point?should we let the mass immigration unchecked and do nothing because most of the immigrants want to live in peace and what not ?? 
  ? europe cannnot save entire middle east and africa by letting them in.this will lead to the colapse of europe as we know it.get your head out of your ass for once . 
  til if you 're polish you can not have a negative opinion about the eu , because your country have profited from the eu ... you know what , i went from very pro-eu to anti-eu in less than half a year and arrogant self-important , '' i know better than you '' assholes like you does n't help it . . 
  grey squirrels do n't exist in lithuania.only the red ones . 
   germany is not gon na continue to let people in at this rate for years at all . 
  so what 's the plan then?how are merkel is gon na stop this stream of migrants/assylum seekers?just wait for the next spring and summer ... 
  yeah because it 's the same thing . / s holy shit ... dude . 
  yeah :d, 
  the biggest issue is the freedom of movement and you know it.i 'm fine if they want a norvegian style of deal . 
  we also have u\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u%c5%begav%c4%97n%c4%97s if someone is interested . 
  that deals are supposed to be mutually beneficial.usually it 's more beneficial to the bigger player at the table.it was always like that , . 
  well usa and to lesser extent germany is doing just that so we 're good . 
  thanks usa ( no sarcasm ) . 
   why does the eu have to have bad stuff?the eu is turning into the largest bureaucratic mess the world has ever seen and is showing no signs of change . 
  people keep talking about good and bad deals . 
  deals are supposed to be mutually beneficial . 
  not true , welcome to the real world m8, 
   if the eu ca n't make its own case on its merits exactly , hopefully eu wo n't bend over , cuz that 's what was happening before the referendum.uk had the best deal in the entire eu , and their population and politicians were not happy anyway , maybe they will like a similar deal to that of norway if they do n't well , tough shit . 
  amicable?lol uk wants all the good stuff , none of the bad.how should eu react if the eu wants to exist?if we give a good deal to the uk , what 's stopping lets say denmark from leaving?i 'm not saying that we have to punish uk , but surely we ca n't give them a good deal ? 
  also your username and a flag is a suspect lol :d, 
  what about '' kill all infidels '' ? 
  poles out for harambe, 
  ` murican ? 
  ouch, 
  well that was quick . 
  everything is a provocation to russia ... 
  nah , cuz you 're regular at / r/the _ donald.btw are you even legally in this subreddit ? 
  just go back to / r/the _ donald you miserable twat . 
  nah , but you apparently a mod of a subreddit called / r/apefugees tells a lot about you . 
  how the fuck he is salty ? 
   exactly - i live in the west almost my whole life lol so you 're not really lithuanian then ... 
  we ai n't iceland m8, 
  `` europe '', 
  well i 'm pro nuclear power , but that does n't matter when you state , and i qoute : '' lithuanians are stupid '' . also people can have different opinions on things , but that does n't make them stupid . 
  no you not , i 'm lithuanian myself.you 're literally calling me and evyrone i know stupid , and then proclaim that you got a right to call me stupid?you 're truly an ignorant twat . 
  so next time say it this way instead of calling entire ethnicity stupid . 
   no , lithuanians are stupid yeah entire nation/ethnicity is stupid.shut the fuck up you ignorant cunt . 
  i ca n't abondon it tho , i 'm fighting for it all day.i have seen the void corrupting it , and then us fighting back to reclaim it , and now again the void trying to destroy it.fight yurop , do n't give up . 
  ok lads , i think our ~ ~ pluses ~ ~ stars are somewhat positioned correctly , time to get rid of the black scum . 
  nah yellow is fine , yes other flags have used the black outline , but they do n't have the black blob right at their border who tries to invade them.yellow / gold represents our birght tomorrow . 
  i think a yellow outline is better m8 , considering that the void is our enemy,
