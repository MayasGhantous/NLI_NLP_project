  we will not protect anyone who is perceived to be a criminal by a legit government . 
  that 's what extradition is for . 
  but we 're talking about basically taking some people who started a fight and toss them into a [ tank full of sharks with lasers attached to their heads ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/drevil_million_dollars.jpg ), 
  where are they supposed to deported ? 
  sorry , should 've specified i was looking for discrimination based on citizenship/nationality where basic human rights are concerned . 
   all i 'm suggesting is that we change the right of asylum so that it 's no longer absolute . 
  how do you propose that should be done ? 
  asylum is embedded into pretty much every constitution on the continent . 
  universal human rights declaration is ratified by as many if not more countries . 
  do you go to trial before denying asylum or just toss the presumption of innocence out the window and be done with it ? 
  do you add `` if the crime is committed by a foreigner he is to be deported '' to each punishment in the criminal code ? 
  do you differentiate which crimes warrant deportation and which do n't based on the severity of them ? 
  sure , the system must be changed to be more efficient , but to change it to what you are suggesting would require a ww3 . 
  do all of them get asylum ? 
   we do n't have the same responsibilities to foreign nationals as we have to our own citizens excuse me ? 
  i 've always found british law to be a bit ridiculous at times , but come on , you really mean to tell me there is actual , lawful discrimination going on in the uk ? 
  you are saying that it is fundamentally wrong to hold a human life in the highest regard . 
  do n't mean you 're wrong , not saying you 're right , but just let that sink in for a moment ... or a week . 
  you 're still not making sense . 
  of course the burden is great . 
  but you ca n't just shy away from a dying person , now can you ? 
  there 're moral high horses to protect , debt to create , the burden is huge and we shall carry it with pride , because human rights are universal !!!, 
  or something ... basically , it 's not something that we can stop doing without unratifying the declaration of human rights and changing pretty much every single freaking one of the constitutions on the continent . 
  apologize and move on . 
  that makes no sense . 
  they can , they do n't want to . 
  it 's to see how much money the corrupt government has stuffed into their pockets . 
  the difference to the 2 % line is that . 
  it 's only protecting them against unjust persecution , it 's not like asylum grants them immunity . 
  one can be a known child rapist , who was granted asylum and locked up in a cell serving his time for all the rapey rapes . 
  does almost certain , unjust death await you in your home country , where you will be forcefully deported if your visa is revoked ? 
  the wording i was looking for : asylum is meant to save lives from pointless deaths and injustice , no matter how shitty and not worth saving the lives may seem to be . 
  it 's article 3 of the human rights declaration . 
  [ thank you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7fmmjatjic ), 
  makes sense until you realize it is very discriminatory . 
  everyone is equal in the eyes of the law , remember ? 
  if a local citizen can start a fight and get off with little to no punitive consequences , why should a foreigner be subjected to a punishment harsher in multiple orders of magnitude ? 
  pretty much every constitution on the continent speaks out against that . 
  that 's the thing - it 's not . 
  asylum is n't given to people who are accused of violent crimes in their home country , it is given to people who 's lives are in real danger because of , what is deemed by the asylum giving country , immoral or unjust persecution/danger . 
  to put it simply , if a known child rapist would come to a refugee camp and ask for asylum on the grounds that the area where he lives is getting constantly bombed , he would get asylum . 
  i guess that would be immoral and against the principle of fair punishment . 
  think about it , normally starting a fight results in what ? 
  a fine , the obligation to pay for damages , maybe some jail time ? 
  for a refugee , who is an actual refugee , fleeing his country for fear of his life , deportation is essentially a death sentence . 
  edit : the wording i was looking for - asylum is meant to save lives from pointless deaths and injustice , no matter how shitty and not worth saving the lives may seem to be . 
  it 's article 3 of the human rights declaration . 
  i did n't say the general was british ... 
  nor do i remember . 
   long needed that 's the problem . 
  it 's been 11 years now and it 's gon na take at least 2 more to reach what was agreed upon to be implemented at the very beginning . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's a good sign of our willingness to contribute . 
  we 're picky choosy about this stuff . 
  if that 's ok , then yeah , we 're contributing willingly . 
  sometimes even eagerly . 
   condescending as fuck . 
  that 's the point . 
  holy crap , m\u00fcsli is a diminutive word !, 
  had no idea . 
  they are behaving incredibly nicely ... judging by how it was in ~ 4-6th century where they came from . 
  ca n't think of a single word that goes with that one :d any examples ? 
  often enough people just stand near a crosswalk talking with no intention of crossing . 
  it makes sense to put at least one foot on the asphalt for the driver to actually know what the intention of the pedestrian is . 
  imho . 
   ( '' - chen '' or '' - el '' ) i believe you are missing - lein , no ? 
  i 'm gon na bet on this article being a bit unfair , to the law misinterpreting it by quite a bit . 
  happens in lithuania too , for lack of will or education to figure out what the law actually means : * when approaching an unregulated pedestrian crossing the driver has to either slow down or stop before the road sign `` pedestrian crossing '' to let pedestrians who ** are in ** any lane of the direction the driver was going to and in roads with only one lane for each direction pedestrians that ** are in ** any lane . 
  * pedestrians may only enter the roadway when they judge the distance to nearing vehicles , their speed as safe and that their actions will not be a hindrance to vehicles . 
  granted , the wording could be more elegant , especially after my translation but this all makes sense when you think about what these two rules seek to achieve . 
  the driver does not have to stop for every person standing near a crosswalk , because a drivers licence does not come with extrasensory abilities to guess who wants to cross and who does n't . 
  once the pedestrian is on the roadway the driver must do everything in his power to slow down enough or stop to allow the pedestrian to cross . 
  the pedestrian needs to make sure that he 's not jumping in front of a car . 
  this is especially important in bad driving conditions , when the roads are slippery ( and i mean proper slippery , not `` omg it snowed 2 mm in the netherlands , panic now '' ) and to deter from people running across the street ( it 's called a crosswalk people , not a crossrun ! ) . 
  basically , the pedestrian judges whether it 's safe for him to enter the crosswalk and he gives the instruction to the approaching driver to slow down/stop by entering the roadway . 
  upon receiving the signal , the driver becomes obligated to make sure his actions fulfill the requirement raised by the pedestrian - to slow down or stop so that the pedestrian can cross safely . 
  if an accident happens the actions of both parties should be judged : * whether the pedestrian was right in his judgment of what is a safe crosswalk and if it is possible for the driver of the approaching vehicle to ensure a safe passing * whether the driver took all the necessary action to ensure the pedestrian could cross safely . 
  naturally , it 's almost always the drivers fault , but there have been cases where pedestrians are blamed for being too reckless when crossing a street . 
  and for good measure . 
  right of way make make you right , but it does n't make you immune to 2 tons of metal . 
  tl ; dr : both parties should have both rights and duties at crosswalks , if the wording is too sucky to convey that then that is what should be changed . 
  not the balance of rights and obligations . 
  agree with the title , the general idea , but :  we are glad for our part to contribute eeeeeeehhhh , that is [ debatable ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/77358000/gif/_77358436_nato_defence_spending_20140903_624.gif ), 
   nothing makes me angrier than lefty wealthy brits , drinking their champagne from the comfort of north london , being nostalgic and regretting the fall of the ussr . 
  this reminds me of a ( not sure if real ) story . 
  2 letters were found after ww1 , one written by a guy in the trenches , another by a general in a command post of sorts . 
  one was complaining about the enemy being 20 feet away and rats for dinner , the other was complaining about the enemy being only 20 km away , and pheasants for dinner again . 
  there is one thing that you are missing , by a mile and that is that you are not reading a newspaper or a novel here , you are reading the law . 
  / u/snokus , i think you should read this too . 
  not because your explanation was wrong , but because it started with the assumption that the subject reading your posts has more knowledge of the law , than he actually does , thus making it harder to get your point across . 
  the problem is , that when it comes to law , the definitions of the words somewhat differ from what the common folk perceives it to mean . 
  the reason for that is that in law it 's not words that are used , but legal terms . 
  for example in the law that you quoted , the terms `` hate speech '' `` threatens '' `` expresses disrespect '' and in some countries even `` race '' `` skin color '' `` nationality '' `` ethnicity '' `` religion '' `` ethnicity '' and `` sexual orientation '' have specific definitions that may ( or may not ) differ from what they suggest . 
  these definitions can be set by either the lawmakers themselves , when passing the laws or the courts through their practice , precedent or even a study ( not sure if sweden has those sessions where a jury of judges gather to judge whether or not something needs specific ( re - ) defining ) . 
  now when it comes to hate speech being a punishable act , there are requirements for the actions of what can be called hate speech ^ ( legal term ) . 
  [ i 've written a quite extensive post about how it is in lithuania , our law banning hate speech sounds pretty much the same ( at least the one in the constitution ) as the one you quoted , so i 'm fairly certain the base principles and even some of the definitions will apply to sweden as well ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3leot9/the_freedom_of_speech/cv5q2bq ) . 
  tl ; dr , it 's not enough to know the law , to understand what the law means even if all the words are clear and used daily . 
  a guy sued the city of vilnius claiming that gediminas castle is his . 
  it went to court , but the guy lost the case . 
  was he close to proving that he 's the owner of one of the most important historic landmarks in vilnius ? 
  a case just going to court does n't mean anything .
