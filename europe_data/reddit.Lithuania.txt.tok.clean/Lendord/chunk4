  sure there might be policies intending to `` lower the crime rate '' , but they are rarely a deterrent , most of the time they are just a call to mobilize and to stop/solve the ongoing crimes in troubling areas , putting the perpetrators behind bars thus making the community safer . 
  point is , there has to be a crime in order for the state to react . 
  being unable to defend oneself you might end up the victim of the crime which will prompt the state to react . 
  secondly , i do n't get the `` we have no clue who those people are '' part . 
  statistically , it 's the best thing ever . 
  most of physical crimes ( rape , assault , murder ) are committed by people known to the victims . 
  there is a bigger chance of you getting killed by your neighbor having a hissy-fit about you blasting your music too loud than a terrorist who infiltrated the eu by pretending to be running from the war . 
  imagine that , sitting at your window , looking at a family of refugees walking down the street , looking all suicide bomby and shit and ** bam ** , your wife hits you on the head with a golf club . 
  would n't that be something ? 
  we live in a time where priests rape , children kill , neighbors set houses on fire , people drive while intoxicated etc. 
  asking for more protection because `` this group of people might be dangerous '' is , in my opinion silly . 
  spread them out across all of eu in groups of people of no more than 10 in 1km ^ 2 and things will be fine . 
  oh please , that 's not a parade . 
  where are all the costumes , the dances , the prancing around ? 
  this is a demonstration . 
  wait , really ? 
  why so soon ? 
  nope , just start applying common sense . 
  i mean , there is no need for these immigrant to come for the world to become a scary and shitty place . 
  murders happen daily , some so gruesome that a beheading on camera looks like a birthday party of a 9-year old in comparison . 
  we had stories like , a girl getting raped , put into a trunk ( alive and well , just raped ) , driven around some woods until finally the car was set on fire . 
  a couple of homeless people set an old mans house on fire with him still inside , because they were `` fed up with him '' . 
  the social worker saw what 's happening and instead of calling the authorities or at least trying to stop the people she ran out of the house to move her car so it does n't catch fire . 
  two schoolgirls killing their classmate , dismembering her body , putting some of her organs in their fridge for alleged later consumption . 
  immigrants do n't scare me any more than my neighbors do ... 
  you buy protective gear and limit the number of strangers you interact with daily to a necessary minimum . 
  10/town 5/street would be perfect i think . 
  we have enough ghost towns . 
  if their welfare will be the same in all countries , after they are divided , then the ones who end up in eastern europe will be the lucky ones . 
  let 's hope other countries follow suit . 
  i 'm really worried we 're just gon na create a new ghetto in vilnius ... : /, 
  nice . 
  i just hope the streets will be at a fair distance . 
  like a couple towns over ... 
  any hints on as to what this `` aggressive '' integration will look like ? 
  why would n't an idealist shut up about his ideals if he ca n't uphold them ? 
  besides , they can always pick up a refugee from a turkish refugee camp and get them to register in every country they pass . 
  if that 's trafficking humans , then train drivers should be jailed by the dozen . 
  if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . 
  kind of a side note : not sure how it is in other countries , but in lithuania you ca n't claim self defense if you hurt someone , or even press charges against someone who attacked you , because you called their mother a cocksucking cumdumpster ( or something provocative in general ) . 
  you both get accused of fighting in such a case . 
  not sure how it is in other countries , but i 'm happy it 's like this here . 
  it 's not as easy as claiming something to get away with it . 
  you have to prove what you claim . 
  the process of court is there for a reason . 
  the examples i gave are just very simplified conclusions of a situation . 
  it usually takes at least a box of paper to come down to it and any slip ups by the defendant are recorded , which do not help to claim ignorance . 
  the laws in lithuania are not the problem , the people are . 
  it is ironic when keeping in mind that law studies attract the biggest number of students every year here , but fact of the matter is most lithuanians do n't understand how law works . 
  i imagine this applies to a lot of other countries as well as `` basic law '' is n't the most popular course for basic education ( schools ) . 
  the problem stems from thinking that it is enough to know the law to understand who is guilty and who is not . 
  that is rarely the case but people do not understand that the process of trial is just as important to any case as the ( in - ) action that the person is being trialed for or the verdict of the judge ( jury ) . 
  when dealing with criminal activities like inciting hate/crime/defamation / perjury it becomes especially apparent and problematic , and here 's why : one of the absolute most important things to find someone guilty is guilt . 
  not the feeling you get for eating the last cookie , but the legal term . 
  it consists of two parts , subjective and objective . 
  both have to be determined in court . 
  ** objective ** guilt , boiled down , is whether a person had the opportunity and/or obligation to know that his ( in - ) actions are criminal . 
  now this part raises little questions when dealing with physical crimes like theft , arson , murder etc. , but when it comes to inciting hate , crime , defaming a person it becomes an eyebrow raiser . 
  is there a way to know objectively whether a speech will incite hate ? 
  is there a way to know if a speech will incite a crime ? 
  without proving objective guilt , there will be no guilty verdict . 
  i find the example of a raging sociopath homophobic * friend * to be a good example of how messy this subject is . 
  imagine you have a friend . 
  he 's a raging , sociopathic , homophobe , who has , in the past released his anger towards a gay person resulting in the person being severely hurt . 
  now two scenarios : * you know him since childhood , including his violent past and both his views and the extremity of those views on homosexuals . 
  you are chilling with him and when a gay man ( you know that for a fact ) passes you tell your friend that this man is gay . 
  your friend jumps the guy beating him half to death . 
  * you do n't know him long enough , to know what kind of a person he is . 
  you are chilling with him and when a gay man ( you know that for a fact ) passes you tell your friend that this man is gay . 
  your friend jumps the guy beating him half to death . 
  in both these cases , speaking generally , it is your fault that the man was beaten up , but can your role in both of them be perceived as objectively criminal ; did you have an opportunity and/or duty to know that your friend is a raging sociopath who will jump at any and every homosexual ? 
  does saying that someone is gay immediately put said person in danger of imminent attack ? 
  if the answer to either of these questions is `` no '' then your actions are not criminal . 
  ** subjective ** guilt is almost always tricky ( unless there 's a confession ) . 
  it essentially means what you thought would happen if you went through with your ( in - ) action . 
  it is separated into 4 categories ( gon na put them into the examples of the raging friend ) : * direct intent * . 
  you know what your actions can bring and want it to happen . 
  * you know him since childhood , including his violent past and both his views and the extremity of those views on homosexuals . 
  you are chilling with him and when a gay man ( you know that for a fact ) passes you tell your friend that this man is gay , hoping your friend flips at him and beats him up . 
  your friend jumps the guy beating him half to death . 
  * indirect intent * . 
  you know what results your actions may bring , you do not want these results to happen but do n't mind them either , so you proceed . 
  * you know him since childhood , including his violent past and both his views and the extremity of those views on homosexuals . 
  you are chilling with him and when a gay man ( you know that for a fact ) passes you tell your friend that this man is gay . 
  you know your friend might flip out , but do n't really care . 
  your friend jumps the guy beating him half to death . 
  * criminal confidence . 
  * you know the risk of your action , but you are confident that it wo n't come to the worst . 
  * you know him since childhood , including his violent past and both his views and the extremity of those views on homosexuals . 
  you are chilling with him and when a gay man ( you know that for a fact ) passes you tell your friend that this man is gay . 
  you understand that your friend might flip and jump on the guy , but you think you can talk him out of it/stop him . 
  your friend jumps the guy , you try defending him , fail , the guy gets beaten half to death . 
  * criminal negligence . 
  * you know what might happen , but think that it 's almost impossible to be true . 
  * you know him since childhood , including his violent past and both his views and the extremity of those views on homosexuals . 
  you are chilling with him and when a gay man ( you know that for a fact ) passes you tell your friend that this man is gay . 
  you hope your friend is reformed and chill and there 's no way that he would do anything to the gay man . 
  your friend jumps the guy beating him half to death . 
  so now `` where 's the problem '' you might ask , `` it only took you half an hour to write all of that '' you may say . 
  well the problem is that with inciting hate , inciting crime , inciting war , according to the court practice , requires ** objective , direct intent ** .
