if we are talking about declaration of sovereignty , then yes estonia was few months ahead ( baltic republics declared their sovereignty : in november 1988 in estonia , in may 1989 in lithuania and july 1989 in latvia ) . 
  if we 're talking about declaration of independence , then lithuania was first on march 11th 1990 . 
  i am not romanian but , have you talked with it admin ( do n't know if that 's how that person is called ) that manages your dorm 's network ? 
  university have blocked ports in my dorm too , but admin would gladly unblock any ports needed for a game or a program , except maybe for torrent , but i have n't asked . 
  now you 're just making up words . 
  yes . 
  french on lingvist . 
  also watching french movies , listening to radio , etc. 
  calm as a belgian - when someone keeps their calm in stressful situations . 
  does it like a jew - when someone do things backwardly . 
  drinks like a russian - drinks lots of alcohol . 
  somewhat popular , we have few astrologists that are well known throughout a country . 
  there is also a well known witch . 
  and a lot of unknown fortune tellers , that you can only get in contact with through friends . 
  obviously bing have a lot less search results than google . 
  but unless it is some obscure info , you can find everything on bing . 
  at least i do . 
  microsoft edge and bing . 
  come at me !, 
  they do make sense . 
  but some of them just sound weird . 
  au or au\u010d . 
   english , on the other hand , is just doing it without purpose . 
  that 's just ... weird . 
  i mean , why ? 
  they just wanted to be as cool as french people . 
  when in english class , we would say `` a b book '' to one another , because that 's how it sounds when you say `` hey , little dick '' in lithuanian . 
  kind of the same reason why bbc sounded funny . 
  ( bb sounds like dick in lithuanian ), 
  add lithuanians too . 
  also [ this ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/beer-consumption.jpg ) and [ this ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/alcohol-europe.jpg ), 
  it is not that people are ok with it , but as always in lithuania , first people are against something but take no action against it besides rageing on the internet and later they are against it but just dont bother to even say something . 
  ha ha , totally . 
  yes , very stronk !, 
  we already use it !, 
  and as lithuania too . 
  same in lithuania especially if you want to go from/to airport . 
  hey , would you mind sharing some of those hidden gems ? 
  i am going to nice in a week and looking for some interesting places to visit . 
  unsurprisingly , same in lithuania . 
  though you can sometimes hear people on radio saying time in 24h format , probably just reading from pc screen or digital clock . 
  everything is looking good if you believe what politics say . 
  rail baltica officialy opens in 2025 . 
  you 'll have to wait a bit . 
  nonsense , kaunas is the best !, 
  vilnius is piece of shit city full of poles , russians and gypsies . 
  shameful capital city . 
  that 's why many go home each weekend . 
  but as my intent was to move out as soon as possible , i have no need to do that . 
  it is one of the biggest cities in my country , there 's plenty to do and i was lucky to find many friends with similar intrests as me . 
  and if everything fails i can binge watch cat videos all day . 
  first we have to find the centre ... [ where is it ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/centre_of_europe.jpg/1024px-centre_of_europe.jpg ), 
  not in particular . 
  it 's the closest university ( and second biggest city ) from where i live . 
  many people commute this much to work . 
  but it 's far enough , so my family wo n't nag me to come home more often or bother to visit me . 
  that 's kind of the same for me . 
  my grandmother sends me food packages and calls every week . 
  mother does n't care much . 
  i know right !, 
  but most of people i have studied with went home every weekend or so . 
  i found that really strange . 
  it is pretty common to move out . 
  i moved as soon as i could ( 60km ~ ) and visit family maybe once a year . 
  living the dream !, 
   the state of lithuania shall be an independent democratic republic . 
   i ca n't understand lithuanian when i hear it , but there are many similar words , and it 's possible to understand more when reading it , instead of listening . 
  same for latvian , 
  you tip if you liked the service . 
  it is usually 5-10 % . 
  i 'm from lithuania . 
  oh yeah , riga is a nice city . 
  * triggered *, 
  germans drinking radler ? 
  france !, 
  love the language , culture and people !, 
  i do consider moving there . 
  and lithuanians jokes about estonians being slow , so further you go to north slower people gets , eh ? 
  * yellow - sun/light/hapiness * green - meadows/beauty of nature/freedom * red - soil/bravery/spilled blood, 
  * riga * vilnius * warsaw * berlin * amsterdam * brussels * paris looking forward to visiting rome and london . 
  ** latvia ** - better beaches and awesome cities . 
  i like riga and daugavpils . 
  ** belarus ** - do n't know much about it , but we share some history together which is nice . 
  ** poland ** - lots of cheap stuff and great cities !, 
  i will be visiting krakow next month , really exciting !, 
  lithuanian ( for obvious reasons ) , english , russian , basic level of japanese and french ( trying to improve on this one ) . 
  and though not technically speaking i can communicate in lsl ( lithuanian sign language ) . 
  in school you can choose between english , german , russian and french ( if school have a teacher for that , some schools do not ) , but usually ( in smaller schools even more ) all class have to choose one language . 
  -45 c : people in finland buttons up their shirts . 
  these kind of jokes ? 
  largely similar situation in lithuania . 
  gas , gas everywhere . 
  if there are no pipelines people use these gas `` containers '' ( do not know how exactly it is called in english ) http://i.imgur.com/adbggxu.jpg, 
  d-did you count them ? 
  i read and upvote comments , always forget to upvote threads . 
  no , not really . 
  at least not among younger generations , anyways . 
  i would say most of older people miss it or feel nostalgia . 
  because that was the currency they fought for maybe ...
