  putin is trying to hid his bribes for world cup, 
  yup . 
  [ actually lithuania had the biggest % change in gas price ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/d/d6/percentage_change_in_natural_gas_prices_for_household_consumers_2014sem2.png/357px-percentage_change_in_natural_gas_prices_for_household_consumers_2014sem2.png ),

  til we have spies spying on russia . 
  yes i had same experience . 
  it seems it depends on mod mood at the time , one day he likes the content the other day he does not . 
  rules of / r/europe are written so that they are unclear and can be interpreted differently to benefit mods in unclear situations . 
  i think it is bullshit as it gives them power to control content they like vs content they do not like but what can we do ? 
  i wish that one day russians become educated and overthrow their dictator . 
  they lived under dictatorship so long that it became normal to them . 
  is this happening now or you just asked random question ? 
  if it is happening do you have more info or something ? 
  sounds like an interesting topic, 
  honestly i think that all this uk versus eu is plain stupid . 
  it is clear fact that we are better off and stronger together while our competitors would like to see split up eu . 
  i hope the leaders of uk and eu nations comes to terms and end this madness for greater good . 
  lukashenko acting like a rebellious teenager, 
  from your comments you clearly have not lived in lithuania so stop the lies you pesky russian go suck some putin more . 
  i heard latvia is nice this time of the year definitely not lithuania, 
  people are happy . 
  if you have lived in lithuanian you could really tell the amount of development we had . 
  compare us to when we left soviet union being poor with empty shops and people hardly getting by . 
  now middle class is booming , healthcare is great and free , we have any kinds of shops you would find in us or uk . 
  life is great in lithuania and it is getting better and better . 
  while we do not have salaries anything compared to western europe our prices are two to three times lower for common goods which makes it the same living standard . 
  lets open one in lithuania i heard it 's a developed country now, 
  yeah . 
  however i think in todays world the closest we will get if you guys join us at eu and then if their is revolution in belarus to overthrow lukashenka and then they join in . 
  we would all be in eu, 
  i was surpirsed that the gun has a high mobility i would imagine guns on ships would rotate slow for some reason, 
  yes !, 
  those damn russians took our belarus and ukraine it shall return to the glorious gdl !, 
  i think he was the guy who visited us right before ussr collapse and told that lithuania will never be a free state . 
  well look at us now muhahahaha, 
  lithuania stronk !, 
  i think it is the wrong question to ask . 
  it does not matter where they come from or what is their background which makes it hard to integrate it is how the country they immigrated deals with immigrants . 
  what we hear about how badly one group integrates is mostly for media ratings . 
  for example , they say muslims have hard time integrating in france and not the other group just because they are more noticeable . 
  there is 100 muslim immigrants to 1 christian immigrant from middle east . 
  and it takes 1 guy to do something bad so the whole group is associated with that 1 guy . 
  all the roads are tiles :o, 
  wasnt it pegged to the euro ? 
  i always though it was, 
  its actually 1 euro = 4 z\u0142 :p, 
  soon we will see russians in moldova being oppresed and putin coming to the aid, 
  poor greeks who still believe in him . 
  so sad to see where country like greece is heading with this new government . 
  soon we will have to reevaluate our future demographics predictions . 
  since with lab grown food we will be able to feed a lot more people ( when it gets cheaper than now ) and old predictions are bassed on nowadays farming capabilities . 
  such a lovely smile, 
  romanian dude got a better chick, 
  and this post is deleted in 3 ... 2 ... 1, 
  and here goes the greek to the money not what is morally right, 
  it is sad to see how he plays greeks and the worst is that greeks believe him . 
  yes united we stand divided we fall, 
  so the agency is working i see, 
  really ? 
  when was that ? 
  nvm just noticed the post a bit lower with more details silly me, 
  turkey being islamic country was never a problem in eu turkey negotiations . 
  this is aimed for domestic public . 
  it is not that he wants anything from eu but he wants an enemy for easier control of population . 
  it is not that easy to control power in turkey and having an enemy helps him secure the power . 
  so his speach is not that special in geopolitics you can hear same things from russia , china , india even us it is politics 101 . 
  you know those americans slow on everything :d, 
  thank you, 
  what do you mean ? 
  all data is from cia world factbook they do not have stats for mobiles/people that is what i made but the sources are real . 
  here : [ population source ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html?countryname=lithuania&amp;countrycode=lh&amp;regioncode=eur&amp;rank=134#lh ) [ mobile phone source ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2151rank.html?countryname=lithuania&amp;countrycode=lh&amp;regioncode=eur&amp;rank=110#lh ), 
  here is the same comment from main thread there was my comment already linking it to the source but here it is : source : cia world factbook data : [ page 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/essf9cj.png ) , [ page 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qahgtvh.png ) , [ page 3 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/an21wrt.png ) , [ page 4 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tekjy2j.png ) , [ page 5 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/brnffur.png ), 
  the source is in the original thread at / r/mapporn should i add comment her as well ? 
  yes but offical counting was every 10 years i think . 
  and the data is before last official count i believe, 
  i think its customs or somehing lik that becasue in eastern europe it is very popular to have many phones they are all shity but still the more the better, 
  i am pretty sure its phones not sim cards . 
  where are you from ? 
  because in lithuania it is easier to have three phones for three sim cards than one phone for three just because phones are relatively cheap here, 
  yes the population data was 2012 i think and was not updated . 
  if i used nowadays number we would be one color darker :d, 
  no how many phones a person has now on avarge per country, 
  [ for world , asia and americas map check / r/mapporn ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/304ms4/mobile_phones_per_person_1260x646_oc/ ), 
  that is kinda true . 
  then i end up in / r/russia i get amazed by how much nonsense they write but the biggest part is that they believe in it and like really honestly believe it . 
  on the bright side it is good it helps us to understand them and maybe help them in the long run, 
  it was a vassal of poland lithuania comonwealth, 
  well they kinda get to be the star of the baltic countries overperforming the rest with their good managment . 
  certainly both latvia and lithuania should take some advice from those baltic nords . 
  on the other hand it is easier for estonia to manage everything as their population is quite low 3 lithuanians for every estonian or 2 latvians for every estonian, 
  i agree with that . 
  we should buff our defense spending after recent events . 
  the only problem is we do not have spare cash and would need to cut somewhere else and you know how this would turn into political game where everyone starts to blame each other and in the end nothing gets done, 
  not worth it . 
  the region is too underdeveloped if poland or lithuania wanted to take it back would cost too much and do you want extra half a million russians which is brainwashed by russian media ? 
  i do not really know but in lithunia for me it seems that middle class is doing great . 
  the prices remained the same so far as i can tell . 
  although my cousin says that the beer cost more with euro . 
  before it was 6 litas for 0.5 at bar now its 2euros which is something like 8litas but you see the euro depreciated since new year and he makes the exchange at the old rate witch does not exist anymore so i do not really know . 
  on the other side the slight price increase is anticipated and public is aware of that , as far as i can tell , since with euro the prices and salaries grow closer to other euro zone countries .
