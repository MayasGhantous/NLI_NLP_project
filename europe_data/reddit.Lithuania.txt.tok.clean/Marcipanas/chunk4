  i feel you, 
  ca n't tell if sarcasm or backwards thinking, 
  you are hilarious write some more so i can have more laugh, 
  you understand that eu army will only make all the 27 armies unite into one command structure . 
  it will become cheaper for all of us its not like we are building a new army, 
   first of all , i still have to see when did modern russia attempt something like this ukraine 2014 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_military_intervention_in_ukraine_ ( 2014 % e2 % 80 % 93present ) georgia 2008 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war, 
  its funny i have heard the story the other way around . 
  lithuanians register their cars in latvia because its cheaper/more beneficial . 
  that was like 3-4 years ago so maybe some regulation changed . 
  all it took was a quick call from putin, 
  reading the headline did n't expect such a progressive comment on top in / r/europe . 
  faith in / r/europe restored, 
  well in my part of the world nato is the one stoping warmongering . 
  you know its not just white and black . 
  thanks , obama !, 
  of course are n't we all hypocrites to some degree ? 
  we all have our biases and see world through our own way . 
  i am not saying that russia will stay in recession . 
  i was stating my opinion on what would it take to make russian people understand . 
  full support for nato . 
  of course iraq and afghanistan was not that successful and fueled more by people who want more influence in certain regions than genuinely doing good . 
  somethings are not as bad , like the anti-piracy in gulf of aden which is coordinated by nato . 
  in eastern europe we need nato , look at georgia and ukraine if they were in nato i doubt russia would dare to invade them , i am very happy that lithuania is in nato because we alone would not be able to fight of russia 's ambitions . 
  yes , unfortunately it takes time and a lot of time . 
  i imagine if the russian economy stays in recession for a decade or so people will start to realise . 
  good . 
  the government of russia has to understand that we are not in medieval times anymore . 
  russian people need to understand that you can not support warmonger and expect the country to be `` great again '' . 
  your wikipedia article shows casulties during ww2 . 
  russians killed more lithuanians after the war than during if you did n't know that . 
  why are you going to defend russians by saying what if ? 
  you know what ? 
  nazis did not implement their plan but russians did . 
  false , soviets actually did more harm to local populations by killing and sending families to siberia to die , not to mention they had full blown [ russification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification#late_1950s_to_1980s:_advanced_russianization ) program . 
  both were pure evil , if you are jew nazis for sure would have been more evil to you but for local not jewish population soviets were way worse just because of the amount of time they had to fuck up the countries they invaded . 
  `` lithuania lost ~ 8 % of its pre-ww2 inhabittants due to nazi actions and ~ 32 % due to soviet actions ( until year 1953 ) , some 40 % in total ( 1,15 million out of 3 million ) . 
  1/3 to 1/2 of this number were killed . 
  well over 90 % of victims were civilians . '',

  ability to pay off debt is not economy, 
  china already owns half of africa . 
  they dont need war they play the economic game . 
  yes i disagree . 
  i think you have no clue what you are talking about and do not understand how geopolitics work . 
  go read : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_europe#20th_century, 
  wow either you are a troll or just very uneducated, 
  all of them at the same time . 
  yup good luck trying to get any deal done in 2 years, 
  i agree my statemen was worded poorly . 
  the simple answer is i just dont have time to search for the most recent data for individual countries who do not send their data to eurostat . 
  eurostat provides a combination of data from different agencies and i use it . 
  because my source does not have data for 2014 . 
  i trust eurostat data over russian stats agency data . 
  different agencies usually have different methodologies which might skew the results so i prefer to have one general source . 
  moreover , i do it as a small hobby and i do not have time to go search each country for data . 
  strange for me the link is working . 
  try this http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=demo_find&amp;lang=en, 
  extremely fertile women roaming around . 
  sorry for this , do you have recomendations what color scheme would be better to use ? 
  you can take a look at my comment with data it has numerical values instead of colors . 
  how many children does one woman has on average .

  very serious . 
  well maybe half serious . 
  i do believe that one day we will colonize other planets and space objects and human population will be 100 times the current one . 
  however this probably wont happen in this or the following century , but i feel it is the way forward for humans as a specie . 
  you have any source for your claim ? 
  not really . 
  space has all the resources we need . 
  the more people we have the more technologies we can develop and faster . 
  what is your source ? 
  hey your fertility rate is n't that bad , 
  yeah . 
  i was suprised though that central europe has such a low fertility,

  ukraine has the resources and potential to be one of the bigger economies in europe they just need to get their shit togehter . 
  i believe 10-20 years they could join eu if they took right direction from now . 
  i read some interviews with the designers and the original idea was to make poland civilization relate more to the commonwealth and not to the modern poland and that is the reason why lithuanian cities were added , even vilnius was part of the city rotation and one of the first ones ( i think 4th or 5th in row ) . 
  however , the public was not so happy about that , polish people wanted pure poland as it is now and lithuanians were angry as it misrepresented them in the poland commonwealth . 
  btw most uk universities are funded by eu and uk does not have the same capital to keep the same level of funding just fyi,

  i am very glad that nato pushed eastwards because who knows what else russia would have done . 
  look at how the countries are doing which did not join the nato , ukraine , georgia they are in a mess becasue russia decided to invade them . 
  do you have any credible sources to support your claim that euro and eu is impovershing the continent ? 
  becasue the reality is quite the opposite . 
  the life quality and wealth has increased for countries in the eu . 
  how is russia making military exercises next to lithuania is not provocations while nato doing the same is ? 
  also you do know that russia 's exercises are done with 10x more troops and equipment than nato exercises . 
  its true average voter is just plain stupid and does not have the ability to take such important decision . 
  that is why we elect people to take decisions for us . 
  keep believing your dreams . 
  yes , eu is already hit but to believe that eu could be hit harder than the uk by this british nonsense is just laughable . 
  only a brexitier who does not believe `` experts '' could beleive this, 
  hopefully uk will not go full retard like russia with their world vs us attitude,
