  i think it recently the government announced to start using czechia for english purposes . 
  i thought for colour blind people its easy to differentiate the shade from dark to bright ? 
  the map has only one colour . 
  i would be interested to hear what designs would help colour blind people to make it easier . 
  before i used to make maps like that . 
  but got hate because it was colour blind unfriendly . 
  so now i make maps with one colour darker to lighter . 
  i guess you can never satisfy everyone . 
  is it personal or there have been errors in the past ? 
  by the way eurobarometer actual surveys are not done by eu institutions . 
  for this particular report the slovak data and survey was done by tns slovakia which is slovak statistics firm . 
  because you do n't like it or you have something against the europbarometer methodology ? 
  this map shows the % of each eu member state support for common foreign policy . 
  question asked : are you for or against common foreign policy of the 28 member states of the eu . 
  ** survey done : ** april 2017 ** survey info : ** this survey was carried out by tns political & social network in the 28 member states of the european union ( eu ) between 15 and 25 april 2017 . 
  some 28,501 eu citizens were interviewed face-to-face at home on behalf of the directorate-general for communication . 
  ** key findings/insights : ** * almost two thirds ( 65 % ) are in favour of a common foreign policy of the 28 member states . 
  * lithuania is the most favourable towards common foreign policy of eu . 
  * sweden is the only country where more than half are against this ( 55 % ) . 
  * uk not last . 
  * netherlands higher than finland .

  great for the balkan . 
  integration is the only way to provide long term peace and prosperity for the region . 
  simple people have only to gain from joining eu . 
  i can understand that some of the rich and powerful in those countries see it the other way as it would reduce coruption and reduce their influence . 
  that is going to be a fun one . 
  its not that they could lose it , they definitely will if they leave the eu . 
  while i agree that uk usually was the one always dismissing closer integration , i think with enough time we can make them integrated with us . 
  i would welcome them back with open arms . 
  separating will be extremely damaging for uk while also will hurt us . 
  we as europeans should be the force leading the world in peace together , not separated !, 
  good for france . 
  they chose the smart populism . 
  something definitely needed to be done and it looks like the french people really chose smartly and were not manipulated as easily as anglophones . 
  if vatican would apear in statistics it would be the richest country by gdp per capita . 
  not only that , it would be richer by an order of magnitude compared to other countries . 
  yes church is filthy rich . 
  what in your opinion is the likeliest brexit scenario ? 
  soft , hard or none ? 
  good for greece !, 
  it is to avoid any unintended tourists, 
  salty because you ca n't buy alcohol anymore ? 
  i do n't think its as much as a fuck you as just simple economics . 
  $ 2.6 trillion economy vs $ 14 trillion economy . 
  its no brainier that india will prioritise eu trade over uk . 
  for the eu , uk or india is about the same size ( 2.6 vs 2.4 ) so whoever will be easier to deal with . 
  hey , hey man i think you had enough of that stuff, 
  ok really ? 
  referendum was 61 % no at 31 % turnout , that 's like 19 % of voting population deciding for the rest 100 % . 
  there is a reason why almost all democracies are representative and not direct . 
  simple citizens elect representatives to make smart decisions on their behalf . 
  for me i see referendums as undemocratic as usually what happens is manipulative politicians influence simple people to vote one way or another without understanding the consequences and to only benefit the manipulator himself . 
  we have to retake our rightful clay !, 
  come belarus and ukraine we have cookies, 
  ok lets try some facts : gap between rich & poor in russia among world 's biggest . 
  wealth inequality in russia is one of the world 's highest . 
  a report by credit suisse says 35 percent of russian household wealth is controlled by just 110 billionaires . 
  poverty is widespread , living standards are low and , typical of a non-developed country , exportation of natural resources fuels much of russia 's economy . 
  russia is borderline at best on most developed-country metrics . 
  its per capita gdp is $ 24,451 while it is true that russia has a trade surplus it exports are heavily dominated by raw materials while its imports are dominated by hi tech equipment and manufactured goods , meaning that it is extremely reliant on other countries for manufactured and high tech goods . 
  more than 79 % of exports are raw materials , more than 70 % of imports are manufactured goods . 
  looks like russia is truly of highest self sustaining capability . . 
  but where is the freedom ^ tm in that ? 
  they were included not because of political prestige , they were included because officially they matched the criteria to join . 
  only after some 10 years it was revealed that greece government faked the data to get in . 
  now , were the eu auditors incompetent not to see the fake data ? 
  maybe , it depend how well the greeks faked it . 
  how is greece the proof ? 
  corrupt politicians faked data to get euro , spend lavishly with no long term plan , and got into huge debt . 
  was eu supposed to say `` oh well , happens '' and let them go for free ? 
  you pay for your stupidity , greece is on track to long term stability now even though its gon na hurt in the short term . 
  but do n't blame eu , blame greek politics . 
  any proof to your false statement ? 
  if anything eu cares more about simple european people than some national governments . 
  i loved the australian ass, 
  i think it will have one of the biggest impact in eu history as this is a big hit for eu , and it can be increased or decreased depending on how the exit is negotiated . 
  so far it looks like both sides are demanding unreasonable things and honestly i do n't think a deal will be reached in 2 years as the time is too short and we will see hard exit . 
  it will have an effect on europe in short term in decrease of quality of life and economic recession . 
  militarily i do n't expect much to change as eu does not have a huge role in military and most members handle army themselves and through nato . 
  i would have preferred uk staying in as now more than ever , with changing geopolitical landscape we , as europeans , should be united and strong , it is sad that british people decided to go at it alone . 
  however , i think the impact will be a lot more negative on the average british person than on an average eu citizen . 
  eu is losing $ 3.6 trillion economy while the uk is losing access to $ 12 trillion economy . 
  i think recession in eu will last anywhere between 2-5 years , while my prediction for britain is a lot more grimmer , probably they will not see same standard of living for the next 10-15 years . 
  on the bright side for the eu , without uk , we might move with federation reforms quicker which should increase efficient resource allocation within eu , that should accelerate growth . 
  also now common eu army reform should also be reached easier . 
  what is the process of printing euros in eu ?
