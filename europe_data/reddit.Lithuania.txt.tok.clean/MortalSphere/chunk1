to follow up , those two are : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allative_case https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illative_case, 
  you still had an impact on us . 
  lithuanian had 3 more noun cases , speculated to be a finnic influence . 
  two of those are still usable , but they are somewhat gone from our everyday language . 
  not every russian online deserves to be treated this way . 
  thanks !, 
  looks like i spent my life believing teacher 's bullshit ... 
  and they were actually taken from the mongolians . 
  before that , russians were pretty much like us when it came to having harsh swear words . 
  ehh , gothic 3 is still a game made by piranha bytes and had enough charm for me . 
  gothic 4 though , now that 's an abomination . 
  nope , made by ukrainians . 
  fun thing , i remember reading that their studio was set in an old soviet weapons factory . 
  definitely worked out well for the atmosphere . 
  in my opinion downvotes should be disabled . 
  but regardless of that , people often do open up the automatically hidden comments , just for the controversy factor . 
  you 'd actually look like some misunderstood hero to some if you had your comments hidden . 
  now we have a bunch of deleted comments that signal `` he deleted them out of shame '' or some other things . 
  seeing you post a new one that 's just the same just gives off the wrong vibe , makes you look desperate and overall directs attention away from the facts ( that you so want to be seen ) towards you personally . 
  you 're doing gods work here , mr. bot !, 
  what 's up with your comments being deleted and then brought back later ? 
  there is a reason why the asylum status has to be approved , not everyone that asks for it is actually eligible . 
  until then , why should some unconfirmed as a refugee foreigner get a priority over the locals ? 
  they 're more to the north than denmark , m ` afraid . 
  i argued here because i think she is incapable . 
  i 'm leftist myself ( whatever that means nowadays ) , but she is just moronic about it . 
  i argue about being realistic , something which she clearly expressed she does n't support . 
  people vote for many reasons , sometimes seeing someone plain stupid ( yes , i 'm calling her that , but i 'll restrain from attacking you personally ) is enough . 
  close to 30 % of voters start to support the sd party , yet the swede mayor proclaimed that they are undesirable . 
  danish folk accused swedes of not talking about some issues , per svensson answered by saying that his newspaper wo n't talk about `` lies and what 's unimportant '' . 
  while that 's what every journalist does , true , in the context of the debate it did n't really answer why he does n't talk about stuff that has factually happened . 
  does he judge it unimportant ? 
  seems like it , which really means that he is dimissing the concerns of a big chunk of voters . 
  she says that it 's wrong to claim that a city , region or a country can be full . 
  she `` would never say that we have taken enough or that we are full '' . 
  the quote i posted is continuation of that . 
  i deem her extremely irresponsible . 
  there are budgets and time limits . 
  how can you not calculate how many houses you have , how quickly you can build more if needed , the money you have available , etc. 
  [ what the hell ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a6lsxhv.jpg ) i can not believe these people actually are in power . 
  why did you bring that up ? 
  vast majority of languages with latin script shown in the map have it the same . 
  it 's more of author 's personal preference to capitalize words here , maybe because he/she treats them as titles . 
  i do agree that it 's inconsistent with the other scripts , though . 
  then i can agree with you . 
  but it does n't happen here : /, 
  what do the `` similar backgrounds '' imply ? 
  here it 's pretty usual for the russian speaker to follow russian news , pop music , etc. 
  kids are exposed to different background than estonian kids . 
  stuff like that is why we have different views on this . 
  i guess swedish speakers in finland do n't really have a connection to sweden and are a lot more integrated into the society . 
  i have some russian-latvians as friends here in uk . 
  they ca n't speak latvian , not even close . 
  they found latvian history in school irrelevant . 
  they consider themselves russian . 
  that 's very true , although i 'd say that current similarities to polish language stem from us sharing a country for a while and you being `` ponai '' ( panowie ) to us . 
  sharing words is not really a big deal . 
  finnish has thousands of baltic words in it , even though the language is totally different . 
  of course baltic is closer to slavic compared to other language groups , but are they close enough to even mention it ? 
  having ( theoretical ) shared past thousands of years ago is not too relevant nowadays . 
  knowing russian would give zero help when trying to talk to a latvian . 
  there is no mutual intelligibility . 
  but that 's a flag of the reich !, 
  switzerland . 
  extremely low satisfaction with time use . 
  god damn it . 
  see , now that is just stupid . 
  to us in the region it was a fight between two monsters . 
  no `` saving the day '' . 
  the history books i had to go through at school ( might be similar to poland 's ) describe the war operations very , very , very briefly . 
  just a general chronology . 
  most of the information is about how our nation lived under the rule of foreign invaders , what kind of propaganda there was , living conditions , killings . 
  we all like the game `` spot the invisible / s '', 
  the actual longest word is * nebeprisiki\u0161kiakop\u016bsteliaudamas * . 
  add as many prefixes as possible . 
  french . 
  features a skull . 
  checks out . 
  only , add some roses , will ya ? 
  because polish way is objectively worse ? 
  polish text looks busy , there is too much noise in it . 
  letters like \u0160 and \u010c take less space and actually follow a consistent rule throughout the lithuanian script where a single sound is represented by a single letter . 
  that change is called progress . 
  surprise butt joke !, 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ a ^ ^ neighbour ^ ^ who ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ read ^ ^ our ^ ^ superior ^ ^ letters, 
  i agree , if we are talking socially and economically . 
  yet , if you think about how biology works , stripping out all of the establishments we added as humans ... you are a continuation of your parents . 
  a separated part of an organism that continues to live on . 
  if you have kids , your grandchildren some generations later in part will still be you , mixed with other parents , likely from the same nation . 
  a nation is a giant organism , heh . 
  so , if you are proud of your nation , you are proud of yourself , because the nation is you . 
  does n't apply to countries , though . 
  not at all . 
  we have * jausti * which more or less means * to sense * or * to feel * , but there are separate words for each sense , used interchangeably with * jausti * . 
  is * czu\u0107 * only applicable to scent and feel of an object ? 
  the above comment was funny ( maybe ) , because the way english works the word * smell * is both a noun and a verb . 
  no need to add * feel * before it . 
  in ` ush ' u becomes lithuanian a. 
  and i 'd say sh in ` ush ' sounds closer than sh in ` ash ', 
  um , are n't germanic people indo-europeans ?
