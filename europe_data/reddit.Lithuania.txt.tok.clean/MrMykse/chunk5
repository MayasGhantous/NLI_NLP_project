  ** because of refugees situation is getting dangerous ** \u017dydrunas is seeking justice while sticking together with other lithuanians living in sweden . 
  he said because of the refugees the situation in this country is getting out of control . 
  \u201e refugees tried to rape a lithuanian woman two months ago . 
  police did n`t do anything , just put electronic bracelets on them so they know their whereabouts . 
  they did not do anything else . `` , - said \u017dydr\u016bnas . 
  according to him , last year refugees attacked another lithuanian woman and tried to steal her puppy . 
  \u201e refugees are harassing people , we ca n`t walk the streets freely . 
  it is awful what is happening here . `` , - said arminas ` father . 
  ** they will be looking for help ** according to him swedes themselves are afraid to speak freely about everything that is happening . 
  \u017dydr\u016bnas says even the girl ` s parents , who was defended from refugee harassment by arminas , are afraid to talk . 
  \u201e in lithuania it is different . 
  everything gets publicized . 
  but here they are keeping everything silent , they hide it , then it gets forgotten and the story ends `` , - observes \u017dydr\u016bnas . 
  he states that he will be looking for help from lithuanian ambassador and consul in sweden soon . 
  what he needs the most now is a good lawyer . 
  ** was disappointed by school headmaster ` s reaction : he spoke for 5 minutes and that ` s it . 
  ** \u017dydr\u016bnas is also disappointed that this problem was n`t addressed enough in school too . 
  \u201e headmaster gathered all pupils to one place , they all were gathered in the lobby . 
  he spoke for 5 minutes and that ` s it . 
  is that a grieving process ? 
  is that how long the headmaster has to speak after tragedy such as this ? `` , - asked the man without trying to hide his outrage . 
  \u017dydr\u016bnas said he spoke personally with the headmaster , who apologized , but according to the father , it does n`t relieve his suffering . 
  \u201e the headmaster knew about those conflicts , but did n`t do anything to stop it . 
  they knew that the other teenager threatened to seek revenge . `` , - said \u017dydr\u016bnas . 
  ** refugee ` s father said that his son was bullied , but lithuanians deny it ** delfi reminds you that on tuesday a video spread through the internet where you could see a fight between the lithuanian and his schoolmate ahmed . 
  it was uploaded in an arab internet portal \u201e alkompis `` together with ahmed father 's - mustafa ` s interview , where he is saying that his son was bullied by his schoolmates and did n`t want to go to school . 
  according to him , he informed school ` s administration about it , but it did not take any decisive means . 
  \u201e those are all lies . 
  right now , at this moment , three pupils from the same school stand near me , who said that boy was n`t bullied . 
  he was treated as a human being . `` , - said \u017dydr\u016bnas . 
  ** refugees are n`t known as exemplary students ** he said that the school which was attended by his son , was attended by a lot of refugees too . 
  there are even separate classes for children and teenagers who are not fluent in swedish . 
  \u201e i was told by the children : several refugees were expelled because they played with knifes and smoked , during classes `` , - situation in school described by \u017dydr\u016bnas . 
  this school is attended by not a lot of lithuanians , only 10 . 
  some of them did n`t go to class today . 
  parents did n`t let them because they afraid of their children safety . 
  \u201e we truly did not think things like these could happen . 
  it is sweden . 
  such a country . 
  culture and all . 
  how could it happen ... `` , - said the man sorrowfuly . 
  ** struck with a knife ** delfi reminds you that the conflict between teenagers happned on monday , approximately 12.45 h , native time . 
  14 year old , supposedly a child of refugees , struck a lithuanian with a knife , according to non-official sources arminas was hit with a knife five times . 
  he was brought to kristianstad hospital , where he died from wounds . 
  it is reported that at the school where it happened security was tightened . 
  it is promised that soon psychologists will start to talk with the school students .

  guy did some paintings of lithuania https://www.reddit.com/r/lithuania/comments/2uw0sp/hi_rlithuania_i_had_pleinair_in_your_beautiful/ 2 . vytis tattoo https://www.reddit.com/r/lithuania/comments/3bo137/finished_tattoo_of_vytis_representing_my_100/ 3 . polandballs baltics rpg https://www.reddit.com/r/lithuania/comments/2vs2dm/baltics_rpg/, 
  good the more healthy people the better, 
  i dont know but its true for lithuanian one . 
  ups checked your comment history looks like you really dont like lithuania . . something is really wrong with you . .  the book was n't written in poland , but in prussia . 
  which makes obvious that grand duchy of lithuania has nothing common with republic of lithuania or hostorical samogitia . 
  wot ? 
  so because it was written in prussia it has nothing to do with lithuania ? 
   the book was written in samogitian , that later was called lithuanian . 
  so i guess people that speak samogitian to this day speak some made up language ? 
  and lithuanians speak samagotian ? 
  nice logic m8 . . 
  i have no reason to talk about other things you said cause they are just a bunch off guessing like then something like `` lithuanian identity '' has come to minds of balts and they took this name . 
  or like how gedymin , which was arguably a ruthenian ? 
  guessing on how many percentages were actually polonized . . 
  but yeah your comment history shows that you clearly do have something against lithuania . . 
   as the name and his biography suggest he was a samogitian balt , not a lithuanian . 
  doesnt really change the fact that the book was written in lithuanian . .  polonization was volountairy and affected only a small member of society ( about 10-15 % of people ) and only the upper class ( members of nobility ) and was n't localized but located in whole poland . 
  not sure where are you getting the 10 % -15 % ? 
   and poles who founded and build wilno and kowno like andrzej jastrz\u0119biec the first bishop of wilno were living there from at least xiii-xiv century , many of them were born in poland and they moved there as the merchant routes opened . 
  even tho it was a lithuanian grand duke who found the city ? 
   while the baltic tribes ( the ancestors of today lithuanians ) mainly inhabited territory of present day lithuania . 
  the official language was russian slavic language ( including written language ) and polish to 1699 . 
   no , they did n't live there they lived in most of lands of today lithuania . 
  wilno , kowno and lands for centuries were always ethnic polish territories https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martynas_ma%c5%bevydas https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polonization, 
   in 1260 the grand duchy of lithuania was the land of lithuania , and ethnic lithuanians formed majority ( 67.5 % ) of its 400,000 people . 
  with the acquisition of new ruthenian territories , in 1340 this portion decreased to 30 % by the time of the largest expansion towards rus ' lands , which came at the end of the 13th and during the 14th century , the territory of the grand duchy of lithuania was 800 to 930 thousand km2 , just 10 % to 14 % of which was ethnically lithuanian . 
  the only reason it became ruthenian was expansion into the ruthenian lands.in 1260 the lithuanians lived where todays lithuania is . 
   will take them and go back to our region , '' he said . 
  `` i wo n't allow one of my daughters to have a relationship with a young man under the guise of friendship . 
  and i ca n't imagine myself sitting in the spectator chair if my son decides to drink alcohol . 
  everything is allowed there , and i ca n't possibly go on like this . 
   will take them and go back to our region well if he just can get back to the region after `` fleeing a war '' he is not really a refugee is he . . 
   we really do n't need any army at all once again do you really think someone would defend a nation that has no army?if they didnt even tried to defend themselves why should some nato member even bother ? 
  ohh yeah lets all run away into the west cause that all went so well in ww2 . . 
   looking at our history we really do n't need any army at all , we ca n't win anything anyway . 
  ugh that has to be one off the stupidest things i have ever heard .
