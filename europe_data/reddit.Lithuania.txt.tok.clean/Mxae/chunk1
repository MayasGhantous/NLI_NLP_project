what 's interesting is that the western european countries are usually the ones thinking twice about more sanctions , and the baltics and poland , for whom russia is usually the largest trade partner , have to encourage them . 
  visit the * beautiful * [ lithuanian legislature ] ( http://www.lrs.lt/upl_files/lietuvos_pirmininkavimas_es/vaizdai_2/06_17_seimo_r%c5%abmai.jpg ) while you 're at it as well !, 
  we also have hesburger in lithuania . 
  never had them drunk , but can confirm that sober it 's pretty gross . 
  a lot of it ? 
  probably . 
  all of it ? 
  nope . 
  strong = good , weak = bad . 
  got it . 
  actually , he 's saying `` su prezidente dalia grybauskaite , '' the \u0117 drops in the instrumental case and pronunciation changes . 
  do n't be angry just because we 're tied now . 
  lol , i did n't say i subscribed to those views , just saying people 's opinions i encounter . 
  not to mention that as a eu representative he wo n't really have time for that thing . 
  okay , i get it . 
  probably was focusing too much on the detail there . 
  sikorski is pretty great in the broader outlook , but his politics worry some people regionally . 
  polish-lithuanian relations . 
  totally . 
  because making rich people give money to the government is helping their corporate schemes . 
  you 're making it seem like you 're saying that whenever we can replace a computer/machine with a human , we should , because we relate with humans . 
  unfortunately your econ . 
  justification does n't really make sense . 
  oligarchs more or less unilaterally determined putin 's election , as they did with yeltsin 's . 
  but they underestimated him . 
  i would n't have too many hopes , if a billionaire steps up putin * will * bring him to his knees . 
  easy there , estonia . 
  the reason probably has to do with uncertainty . 
  but once you can see that prices do n't skyrocket and evil ecb bankers do n't try to take your last penny , everybody can relax . 
  that 's true . 
  still ca n't see where you 're going with it though , because there 's plenty of inelastic goods that are under control of private enterprise . 
  i 'm not even arguing that private companies should be the only ones with access to water supplies , i 'm just wondering why you or / u/galactic _ kitten or others think a state is more reliable . 
   a state that is n't taking its responsibilities seriously should be replaced one way or another . 
  you could argue this is the citizens ' moral responsibility , but it 's very unlikely to happen in practice . 
  this fact increases exponentially the larger the bureaucracy gets , and the more responsibilities the government takes on that it practically should n't . 
   a companys primary function is to make a profit . 
  so you believe the way they 'll make it is to deprive everyone of water and have them die ? 
   if raising the price or cutting down on the product quality means more profit they will do it and in certain instances they are even required to . 
  yes . 
  they will also lower the price if it means more profit , or make product quality higher ( as strange of a concept as that is ) . 
  this just means that companies will cater to different groups . 
  i do n't follow your argument . 
  why is the state more responsible than any other actor by default ? 
  except those two are not related . 
  any added moderation would make / r/europe even more sterile in terms of ideas , alienating the majority of europeans from this subreddit . 
  unfortunately my imagination is n't fruitful enough to come up with a conspiracy that big . 
  in practically every major thread , the top-rated comment ( s ) is/are a variation of something similar to this : http://imgur.com/vjlghq0 please do n't pretend you 're a minority , do n't contribute even more to a circlejerk . 
  also , there are far less shills than there are people that genuinely think austerity is a better idea than the alternative . 
  usually gets plenty of coverage on internet sites . 
  not so much on television or print . 
  downvoted to oblivion ? 
  when has / r/europe ever been anything other than blatantly , obviously leaning to the left ? 
  the persecution complex is getting ridiculous . 
  are we not even trying to hide bias anymore with articles and sites like these ? 
  i understand you 're going with the logic of polish territory  ( lithuanians invade )  lithuanian territory . 
  that 's wrong because it starts after ww2 . 
  it used to be lithuanian territory  ( polish invade * )  polish territory  ( lithuanians invade )  and so on , and so on . 
  * also , it was an invasion , not a mutiny . 
  it is known the ` mutineers ' were polish army units and that the census was also acknowledged to be tampered with . 
  this is the same as blaming poland for ww2 because of the [ ` incident ' in gleiwitz . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ), 
  keep in mind employers often pay the minimum officially , and then give the rest secretly to avoid taxes . 
  the shadow economy is a big issue in lithuania . 
  tend to agree . 
  however , it seems like nobody understands any of this . 
  the labor party here said they would double the minimum wage and have close to 0 % unemployment within 4 years if you vote for them , and people believed it . 
  what 's shocking is that people who know how to use the internet believe it , aka / r/europe . 
  trickle-down is a totally separate thing . 
  it is fiscal policy and it is/was only implemented by certain people during certain time periods . 
   the market treats rich better than poor . 
  once again , you are totally misunderstanding what the market is . 
  there is no separate market for rich and poor . 
  if the economic situation is improving on a fundamental level , all ` castes ' benefit . 
   people are upset about the notion that the market is this magical thing that universally produces the best results by itself . 
  do you know what the market is ? 
  it is the sum of all human economic interactions . 
  the market is n't some external thing that produces good or bad effects , it is the entire system of people seeking what they want and need . 
  people who talk about the ` invisible hand of the market ' in a sarcastic tone as though it is only used by \u00fcber libertarians and has no place in reality obviously have never sat through a ( at least ) highschool economics course , it is established . 
  it is also established that people trying to control these interactions as they please leads to less freedom and less efficiency . 
  and of course , in / r/europe , the top 3 comments are about the name ... 
  personally i do n't think it 's a good idea . 
  such a step is n't necessary to ` minimize nationalisms ' and i can live freely under my current flag , if those are the 2 arguments . 
  [ glorious soviet architecture . 
  ] ( http://i273.photobucket.com/albums/jj217/stephenaki/5000%20miles%20through%20europe/p1010767.jpg ), 
  because someone earning more money is literally the same as serfdom . 
  actually , he was right in part :  spent more than they could . 
  spain was bankrupted by the irresponsible public sector , not the private , through infamous [ white elephant ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9003214/spains-white-elephant-airport-spents-30-million-euros-on-advertising.html ) projects and crazy pensions , benefits ( applies to greece as well , naturally ) . 
  very unfortunately / u/bleahbloh is one of the few people making sense in this thread . 
  i wo n't go over your entire post , but i will address this :  `` making murder illegal is controlling citizens !, 
  we should teach ourselves not to kill and have no laws ! '', 
  murder affects another person , in fact , it ends their status as a person . 
  when you harm others , the government needs to legislate to address that . 
  drinking red bull does n't affect anyone but yourself . 
  of course i recognize that minors are n't always capable of making that decision , so if parents feel their kids should n't be drinking energy drinks , i can totally see their reasoning . 
  but the previous arguments like `` parents ca n't control the actions of their offspring 24/7 '' are somewhat silly . 
  you do n't need constant observation to maintain some sense of mutual respect and set some ground rules . 
  just incredibly pointless . 
  also , linking to studies that energy drinks are harmful to mental/physical development of children are not a reason for there to be a law . 
  they are a reason for parents to move their kids away from energy drinks . 
  something harmful does n't immediately need to be translated into law .
