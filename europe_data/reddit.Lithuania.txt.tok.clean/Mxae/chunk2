  what a silly waste of resources & what a pointless law . 
   i said `` some days '' . 
  what i meant is that if you prefer putin over thatcher any day of the year , you must know very little about either . 
   thatcher privatised state companies ( under market price ) this policy in itself is n't harmful . 
  we can talk about implementation , but excessive state corporations are a burden to both people and to the state . 
   called mandela a terrorist . 
  he did thinks that can easily be considered terrorism , regardless of his motivation . 
   sure , putin invaded crimea and is highly corrupt , but at least his nation is currently better off than when he started . 
  i 'm not sure about better off at all , but even if it was , it 's called economic growth . 
  it would take a total idiot to get in the way of that in the former ussr that implemented necessary structural reforms . 
  i 'm sure russians would be better off materially and civically with a different leader . 
  also , thatcher 's policies have lead to the uk now being one of the major economies in the west with the highest growth rate . 
  she supports a more confrontational foreign policy regarding russia and is backed by the right-wing parties . 
  also , if you 're not joking and would really take thatcher over putin any day , then i genuinely doubt you have any understanding of either thatcher 's policies or putinist russia . 
  i do n't think it will be determined on the first round , could be wrong . 
  ** lithuania ** `` forest of the gods '' ( `` diev\u0173 mi\u0161kas '' ) by balys sruoga . 
  a novel about the experience of a member of the lithuanian intelligentsia in a concentration camp during ww2 . 
  b. sruoga is a master of irony , sarcasm , and using humor to overcome difficult situations . 
  because of this i find his book to be one of the most piercing holocaust novels . 
  it also reveals about national stereotypes in the day and the relationship between nationalities in eastern and central europe . 
  i was talking about nobody knowing lithuanian . 
  english everybody speaks , for better or worse . 
  not really . 
  i feel as though it 's more exclusive that practically nobody speaks it , like some sort of elite in-joke . 
  also you can have conversations in it without fear of anyone understanding . 
  there 's quite a different perception of it * within * europe as well . 
  it 's usually thrown around a lot more casually in western europe . 
  the baltics usually view them as the life that we could have had but were deprived of . 
  so now politicians say things like `` we need to x to create * swedish * well-being in our country . '', 
  could you clarify on what you mean by `` proper '' and `` xenopohic traditionalist '' liberal ? 
  same here . 
  * rumunai * and * \u010digonai * . 
  i do n't think most people consider them the same , but highly related . 
  if there is an accident , it would minimize the nuclear fallout area within its respective country . 
  an example would be chernobyl , which did more damage to the belarusian ssr than ukrainian . 
  that 's how n-plants tend to work in e. europe , take a look at where the new belarusian plant will be located : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/astravyets, 
  very pretty but also cozy , adorable in a way . 
  probably the most detailed response i 've seen concerning elections on this subreddit ; thanks for that . 
  not really , the report from the council of europe on national minorities from 2011 was `` clean . '', 
  there are some parties/politicians that try to stir shit once in a while but it is n't bad -- we have a long history of multi-ethnic/religious society . 
  report from 2011 : http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/3_fcnmdocs/pdf_3rd_sr_lithuania_rev_en.pdf, 
  how are we intolerant ? 
  great news . 
  i 'd love to see more military integration of this sort within the baltics . 
  not complaining , we already do a lot of joint exercises . 
  the logic of nationalist = fascist does n't hold . 
  in any case , it does happen that fascists are also usually nationalists , but i would n't describe * svodoba * as the former . 
  a-at least we 're relevant ... 
  because the police never did anything wrong ever , right ? 
  they have handguns because they 'd be totally mowed over . 
  also , most of the `` police '' at this point seem to be drafted 19-year olds or titushky . 
  regardless of voting fraud allegations , even if the government was elected by ukrainians at one point does n't give them a blank check to kill , what at this point seems to be , 9 people after it has lost popularity . 
  for those confused : lithuania gained its independence on the 16th of february , 1918 but that was broken off in the 1940 's by the occupation of the red army . 
  independence was reinstated in 1990 , but it is regarded as merely continuing the first republic and not the creation of a new state , so we celebrate two independence days : feb. 16th and mar. 
  ** lithuania ** feb. 16 : we celebrate our 96th year of independence ( broken off by ussr occupation and reinstated in 1990 . ), 
  right , forgot to mention . 
  it changes a lot , the gdp of the baltics is growing quite fast . 
  the gdp per capita of each of the baltic states , according to the most recent study by world bank : lithuania 23,399 | 2012 estonia 23,065 | 2012 latvia 20,969 | 2012, 
  well , the most recent update by the dept of statistics put the number at around 2.9 mil . 
  no , the population decline in the baltics is well-documented . 
  close , but not quite right . 
  it 's true that lithuania & latvia have significantly higher debt levels than estonia ( 40.5 & 40.7 compared to 9.8 , respectively ) , this recent growth does not have much to do that with that . 
  the estonian debt to gdp ratio has actually come close to doubling in recent years , from around 6 % in 2012 and hovering around 10 % at the moment . 
  meanwhile the lithuanian & latvian government debt levels are staying about the same , in fact they have even decreased to around 39 % from 40 % or so a couple quarters ago . 
  it 's definitely true that the estonian government is more fiscally responsible when it comes to this certain metric , but it 's not as though there has been a recent jump in debt that may have caused this . 
  lithuania : a guilty pleasure . 
  well , considering / r/europe is forcefully left-wing , i ca n't see what you 're lamenting over . 
  of course it deserves a serious reply , if you 're not interested in that do n't post vague satire over gun control . 
  i think this sort of cheap satire is totally inappropriate in this context , not to mention it has nothing to do with the discussion anyway . 
  if you look at a lot of nazi publications you 'll find they have much of the same rhetoric as communist ones -- for example anti-capitalism and whatnot . 
  the only difference is that the nazis had a scapegoat based on ethnicity , and the communists one on income level . 
  that still did n't stop communists from targeting a lot of ethnic groups regardless , though , and engaging in forced russification policies . 
  i think a lot of western europeans look at communism with rose-tinted glasses , and that is dangerous . 
  well , no ideology is necessarily `` inherently bad . '', 
  and if you want to compare communism and fascism , you could point towards plenty of non-violent intellectual proto-fascists ( e.g. 
  evola ) and say that fascism is a good ideology , but it 's not the truth -- same goes for communism . 
  i do not think communism is any better in these terms . 
  alright , my fault for only skimming through the article . 
  in any case , i would stand by my assertion , corruption within the eu-apparatus is n't exactly nonexistent either . 
  honestly , this is was n't unexpected . 
  when you create these undemocratic , unaccountable institutions and give them so much free rein ... do n't get me wrong , i love the idea of a united europe - trading , cooperating , helping one another . 
  but this just seems like a forced union , half the people do n't want to be there and the other half has developed stockholm syndrome . 
  there 's a baltic sphere now ? 
  except that our gdp per capita is higher than either of theirs . 
  mwahahaha we are a whole couple dollars wealthier !, 
  they 're probably from belarus , and the majority there speak russian as a native language . 
  even if they 're not , it 's meant for ukrainians , and most can speak the language , so it 's better than writing it in lithuanian or etc. 
  which the vast majority do n't understand . 
  in case anyone is interested : in pic 2 you can see prof. ** v.landsbergis ** , leading figure during the struggle for independence in 1990 . 
  in pic 6 you can see the belarusian flag prior to the 1995 referendum , a symbol of the ** belarusian opposition ** . 
  also a sign with `` glory to heroes '' in russian . 
  flag of ** georgia ** in pic 9 . 
  bad idea . 
  i really do n't mind that english has status as a de facto official language , language of science / business , etc. 
  but making it a de jure official language would go too far . 
  basically , i think attempts to federalize , centralize , universalize , etc. 
  the eu will go badly -- people still have identities distinct of those that are just european . 
  jeez , i feel sorry for you guys . 
  we have a party here that signed an association agreement with united russia that 's led by a crazy ex-pm , but it is practically insignificant -- 7/1500 representatives in municipal councils . 
  we do have the labor party though , whose leader flies to moscow every once in a while and i think has an agenda beyond what they 're revealing , and they 're the 3rd biggest party .
