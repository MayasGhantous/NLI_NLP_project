i 'm not from estonia , so i will tell about my experience in lithuania , but i only knew a single such case outside visaginas ( where a lot of people do not know lithuanian at all ) . 
  most of the time they either use lithuanian , but if they speak very badly , they will speak in russian . 
   it 's not ethnic cleansing , it 's deportation of illegal immigrants . 
  every country does it . 
  how would this have been any different ? 
  no matter how you spin it , for over 40 years before the dissolution of ussr , there was a different government actually running things in estonia . 
  that government considered them local citizens and not illegal migrants . 
  only after a change in government , some people were suddenly declared non-citizens based on different criteria and different laws . 
  it is not how the illegal migration works in most other countries . 
  yes , the situation in baltic counties is different from mexicans crossing usa border and staying there without visas or other similar scenarios . 
  you 're right . 
  i just saw that the general idea of that comment was correct and did n't look into details when linking and quoting it . 
  [ evaldas _ ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/evaldas_ ) [ explains it nicely in r/etymologymaps ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/2agiu4/pencil_in_various_european_languages_oc_17001372/ciyydf6 )  * pie\u0161tukas * , the lithuanian word , is a derivative made from a root of a verb * pie\u0161ti * ` to draw ' and a suffix * - tukas * ( this suffix denotes a small tool ) . 
   euras and centas ( singular ) , eurai and centai ( plural . ) . 
  as 1/100 of litas is also called centas , we will have few fun confusing weeks . 
  depends on the details of the contracts . 
  some of it may often be included into the initial price of the product . 
  things work differently for the personal use and the deployment in large organisations . 
  the software is free , but support and maintenance are not . 
  there are also problems with liability when something bad happens . 
  it does not mean that free open source systems are bad , simply that they are not magical cheap solution for every case . 
  if it only were homo sovieticuses , it would not be so bad . 
  the religion still retains a lot of influence here and the religious establishment is against homosexuality . 
  in lithuania there is some influence from both . 
  i 'd even say that polish influence is more active in long term . 
  there is a polish political party which constantly gets votes from polish-lithuanians and some seats in parliament . 
  they are very conservative and are against gays , abortions , etc. 
  as there is no strong russian centred party , polish political party also tries to attract the votes of russian speaking-population as well . 
  the polish minority also gets actual support from poland itself . 
  nothing strange , in some countries english is the 2nd language for many people , in others - 3rd , in some - 4th . 
  and there is uk and ireland , where it is the main language . 
  reading comments on delfi is always an awful experience . 
  guess how russia supplies their exclave in kaliningrad with food . 
  so yeah , there was a loot of food trade between lithuania , poland and russia . 
  russian , lithuanian and english . 
  it did its job actually - forcing german army to attack around it . 
  unfortunately for france , they underestimated how quickly germans would be able to go through belgium and where exactly they 'd do it .

  could you give a link to that interview ? 
  for lithuanians , [ jogaila ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c5%82adys%c5%82aw_ii_jagie%c5%82%c5%82o ) , also know to many outside the country as polish king w\u0142adys\u0142aw ii jagie\u0142\u0142o , is considered the greatest traitor ever . 
  he was originally the grand duke of lithuania [ when it was near its peak ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/polska_1386_-_1434.png/1920px-polska_1386_-_1434.png ) . 
  then he married the monarch of poland , [ jadwiga ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jadwiga_of_poland ) ( she was officially titled `` king '' by the way ) and became a sole king of poland after her death . 
  as a result of this marriage he started essentially absorbing grand duchy of lithuania into kingdom of poland . 
  that was not very popular with lithuanian nobles , who rallied behind his brother [ vytautas the great ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/vytautas ) , who was technically ruling as a grand duke of lithuania in jogaila 's name , while jogaila was in poland . 
  there was no direct military confrontation , as both countries remained allies , especially against the teuton order , but there were many diplomatic games . 
  lithuania was at its peak during vytautas ' reign and he is now considered one of the greatest heroes of lithuania . 
  there was an attempt to crown vytautas to ensure lithuanian independence , but he died before it could be done ( he was ~ 80 years old by that time ) . 
  so , in short , jogaila is hated here for selling out the his birth country stretching from the baltick to the black sea to the poland . 
  while russia has it 's problems , some ex-ussr countries are even worse off , especially in central asia . 
  a lot of people from there come to russia illegally to work and are literally called gastarbeiters by russians . 
  even ukraine was worse off than russia economically in many ways even before all the recent events . 
  while the annexation of crimea by russia was definitely not a good thing , many crimeans voted yes expecting better conditions in russia . 
  of course most of them expected almost magical `` poof '' - welcome to russia with better wages and less problems . 
  the realisation of how many problems arise due to such drastic actions came later . 
  of course for people living in baltic states and finland there is little incentive to move to russia . 
  even most people with alien passports in latvia and estonia are better off in their current situation than the one they 'd be in if they decide to apply for the russian citizenship . 
   english is already a mandatory class in german schools , so by the time the average student ends up in a university , they already know english well enough to at least read it , and many more are already near-perfectly fluent in it . 
  what kind of english is taught in german schools ? 
  does the curriculum include the basic terminology of different science fields ? 
  i 'm asking this , because i 've seen the level of english knowledge of the people who had finished the very good high school here in lithuania and who planned to study physics abroad . 
  they had a decent knowledge of english - they could read english literature , watch films in english , communicate on everyday topics . 
  however , almost all of them completely lacked even in basic math terminology . 
  they tried to translate the terms from their native tongue with no success , as they were never taught any science terminology . 
  the general school-level english is not enough to communicate on specialised topics without a lot of additional studying . 
  fortunately , it is voluntarily opt-in . 
  if you want your ethnicity to be mentioned , you have to ask for that . 
  not sure if any ussr rubles were ever minted in lithuania . 
  as far as i 've heard , only mints in moscow and leningrad ( modern st. petersburg ) were producing the currency in ussr . 
  however , some of the first things minted after the independence were [ these coins ] ( http://s1.15cdn.lt/images/photos/616246/big/fido-skaicius-533149d81e007.jpg ) . 
  not a basketball fan , do not drink beer ( or any alcoholic beverages ) . 
  there were other cases - in 1955 the joint [ allied occupation of austria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied-occupied_austria ) ended with all countries ( including ussr ) withdrawing their armed forces . 
  one of the conditions was the perpetual neutrality of austria , which was met . 
   i think calling some russian town based on peter the great would n't have controversy . 
  [ some russian town ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_petersburg ), 
  in latvia it was [ two weeks ] ( http://www.eiro.lv/en/media/media-kit/official-conversion-rate-and-periods-of-lats-to-euro-transition - ) where local currency was still accepted . 
  so i guess it will be similar for lithuania . 
  did n't know that . 
  i think you confused it with the similarly sounding latvian lat . 
  they 've already switched on 1st jan , 2014 and the rate was 1 lat = 1.43 euro . 
  must have been the only case of local currency being more valuable than euro , which replaced it . 
  there will be a lot of [ ground ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:2_litai_coin_%281997%29.jpg ) for [ confusion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:5_litai_coin_%281997%29.jpg ) while both litas and euro will be in use . 
  still , i like how lithuanian euro coins look like . 
  how about extremely similar [ coats of arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vytis ) ? 
  can somebody explain why latvian * saeima * and lithuanian * seimas * are put in different groups ? 
  it would seem at a first glance that words referring to the same kind of institution , sounding very similar in close languages are likely to have the same origin . 
  what am i missing ? 
  the same acronym was a deliberate move by lucas . 
  this flag , donetsk * people 's * republic - what kind of impression are they trying to make ? 
  they seem either clueless or just `` honest '' . 
  [ smbc has proposed a perfect plan if things were working this way ] ( http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2781 ) . 
  no , most of them do n't have russian citizenship , but have estonian or latvian non-citizenship and an alien passport . 
  they do not protest about the language itself being taught , but against teching other subjects in russian language schools only in estonian . 
  i do n't know about latvia , but in lithuania the rebroadcast is handled by private companies . 
  i 've found [ the recording of that speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=jpfdo9tvj7e#t=28 ) . 
  yes , translation is very accurate . 
  thanks for correction . 
   austrians willingly joined germany by referendum the referendum never happened . 
  the government was removed in coup d'\u00e9tat and german forces crossed the border .
