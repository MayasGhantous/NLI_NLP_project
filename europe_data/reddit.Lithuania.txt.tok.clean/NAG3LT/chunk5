  - papa also german ? 
  would have been a big ** tak ** few years ago . 
  yeah , does n't seem optimistic, 
  they made sense when year started in march . 
   you just press-n-hold e or s. i see . 
  practical only for occasional use . 
  otherwise it is much slower than a dedicated layout . 
  i really hate how in ios i have no option to have a dedicated layout for lithuanian typing . 
   on a mac , you do n't . 
  how does it work on mac os then , f.e. 
  when i want to type \u0118 , \u0116 or \u0160 ? 
   used the latin alphabet . 
  switching keyboard layouts is a pain still have to switch between languages with latin alphabet . 
  different languages have different letters , even while using latin script . 
  [ morocco has already participated in eurovision in 1980 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morocco_in_the_eurovision_song_contest ) . 
   semantics , the point of my argument is no one googles who won the lithuanian election except lithuanians . 
  googling a little bit about the country is usually a good idea to avoid making some silly mistakes while dissing it , like this one  lithuanian president should n't come across as so arrogant it 's not like ** he ** is the president of estonia . 
  currently , presidents of both [ lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dalia_grybauskait%c4%97 ) and [ estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kersti_kaljulaid ) are women . 
  no need to google specific election results , name of the country is enough to show who the current head of state is . 
   no one has ever hear of lithuania except at visa offices where lithuanians are found trying to gain access to the uk or us no visa needed for uk at the moment , we 'll see what happens after brexit is finalised . 
  for usa , lithuania is included in [ visa waiver program ] ( https://www.learn4good.com/travel/usa_visa.htm#req ) , so lithuanian citizens can visit usa for tourism and business reasons for 90 days without visa . 
   well , to be honest , probably our russians appreciate that . 
  i speak russian , but i hate playing most games in russian translation . 
  the quality is often quite poor , good voices are extremely rare . 
  the few good ones are usually games from central and eastern europe , mostly the ones where russian is an original language ( stalker , metro ), 
   according to steam , we 're rich enough to pay eu prices , but not good enough to be in the same region . 
  the cherry on top is when the game is locked to russian language only . 
  the thing i hate the most about steam . 
  when i see games that cost more than in france and are regionally locked , i start wondering , why i do n't just pirate them . 
  also , even for those who understand russian , most game translations to russian are horrible . 
  three oldest justices are 78 , 80 , and 83 years old . 
  so it is not unreasonable to expect them to die within next 4 years . 
  was that post calling all of them democrat ? 
  because 2 of them were appointed a democrat president and one was appointed by a republican president . 
   thats why the democrats are worried because they only have 3 supreme judges in the supreme court the leanings of justices mostly matter in case of vagueness in existing laws . 
  in case of clearly unconstitutional laws or orders , they are likely to fully agree . 
  also , the liberal/conservative split in us supreme court at the moment is 4-4 . 
  finally , a small nitpick - us supreme court judges are called [ * justices * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judge#united_states ) , not * supreme judges * . 
   is n't the $ 500 note being decommissioned at the same time ? 
  odd timing . 
  quite different scales 500 pln ~ = $ 115, 
   is worse the right word ? 
  i think abortions are generally a good thing . 
  access to them when necessary is a good thing . 
  as they have been legal and available throughout the period shown in the graph , the decrease means that less people need them over time . 
  most likely due to the better sexual education and availability of contraceptives . 
  this is a good development . 
   sometimes i get lost under the many layers of eu-ness . 
  it 's okay , eu and other european treaties are a complex subject with many pitfalls . 
   this is a natural fact of * schengen * . 
  the wealth , capital , and skilled/ambitious folk were always going to end up in a few western european cities . 
  just a correction about the terms - schengen area is only about removing the border controls between participating countries . 
  being in schengen area is not the same as being able to work without additional permit in another eu country . 
  here are some examples - after eu enlargement in 2004 , citizens of newly joined countries ( eu8 ) could work in uk right away without extra permit . 
  they just needed to show a passport when entering uk , because it was not in schengen . 
  meanwhile , while eu8 were in schengen by 2008 , their citizens could travel to germany without any border checks in their way , but still needed a permit to work there until 2011 , when working restrictions for them were lifted . 
  currently , croatia is outside schengen area , but their citizens can already freely travel and work in those eu countries that do not apply temporary work restrictions to croatian citizens . 
  they just need to pass a very simple border check by showing their passport . 
   we could switch tomorrow and no one would bat an eye . 
  they would . 
  there was a lot of attention in lithuania during the euro switch even after a decade of a very stable peg . 
  a lot of people claimed any increase in prices was due to the euro , no matter the actual reason . 
  i was surprised to see a big poster advertising clothes with black models here in lithuania . 
  we have extremely few black people here . 
  compared to the baltic states , there are a lot of blacks in czechia ( at least in prague ) . 
  go through multiple proxies or vpn servers when making many requests . 
  `` 25 $ is almost 87.5 litas , quite a lot of money '' . 
  while i think in $ most of the time ( we adopted it ~ 2 years ago ) , i guess that i will remember the exchange rate 3.45 lt / $ for a long time . 
   and in relation to not being able to support a child the parents could just give the baby up for adoption rather than denying it life . 
  carrying pregnancy to the full 9 months term and then going through childbirth is far from being hassle-free . 
  forcing a grown up person to go through this process against her will sounds very wrong . 
   their government has also been going on for 400 years 228 years actually , from the date [ us constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_constitution ) came into effect . 
  at most generous , 241 years since us declaration of independence . 
  before that you can not call it the same government system at all . 
  nato was created to protect from attacks on its members in north america and europe . 
  overseas colonies have never been under nato protection . 
  for example , nato members were n't obliged to help uk during the falklands war . 
   `` independent '' ... of any restrictions in powers placed on him by constitution or the laws . 
  i know about csi , there just was an additional joke in your typo . 
   i guess if you 'd make a cis estonia you would just about cover every murder each season we 'd rather stay out of [ cis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_independent_states ) . 
   since the 1/4 of our population are foreigners . 
  are you referring to non-citizens ? 
  just another page in the history of that region . 
  there was prussia of balts , then german prussia , now it is russian prussia . 
  harsher policies would n't have helped against the biggest kremlin fans either . 
  photographic equipment was already capable of a very good quality in early 20th century , [ here is an example from 1912 ] ( http://www.shorpy.com/node/2392 ) . 
  while technological improvements have been constantly pushing top quality up , they also made getting a decent quality photo easier . 
  well , two lithuanian average wages are still less than the minimum wage in the netherlands , so local services have to be priced accordingly . 
  now that 's sounds very greedy . 
  how much did your haircut cost before and how much does it cost now ? 
  a single place is not the same as a common trend . 
  my local hairdresser just rounded up from 15 lt to 5 $ ( 0.65 $ / 15 % increase ) . 
  [ a land of muslim rooskies with oil ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m2bdw3s.png ) . 
  [ source thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/1ct5vj/a_land_of_muslim_rooskies_with_oil/ ), 
  got a similar sms back in 2014 , when one of the deadlines for cheaper roaming hit while i was abroad . 
  was something to the tune of `` enjoy our new lower prices '' . 
  have n't noticed much about that in the news here . 
  the only reason i 've even learned about it , were russian shills posting her worst photos to show * `` how ugly macron 's wife is '' * , and some of my fb friends shared those posts . 
  meanwhile there was a new joke here after crimea :  why are there so many nato troops in the baltics ? 
    they are protecting english speaking population .
