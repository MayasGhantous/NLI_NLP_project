  fully democratic , non corrupt russia is everyones dream . 
   the 90s and it wo n't happen again it 's not the wests fault it 's that you never had a truly good leader that would n't steal or be corrupted , you never wanted to have western ideals , yet you want to be rich and powerful as them . 
  baltics or poland etc are example of succseful transition to western world . 
  european union is the best , no need to change the name . 
  not really , but some regional union would be great . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ nordic ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ anshluss ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ us, 
   the truth is you are never prepared . 
  we 're prepared for holding off russians before whole nato wrath comes uppon russia . 
   it 's lovely living in your own little bubble where you 're deluded into wargames and money spending for your newest toys . 
  and when they come , you will not even know what hit you . 
  you ca n't do a huge surprise attack with todays technology , especially on european continent . 
  about time . 
  and what kind of problem that creates ? 
  none . 
  commonwealth is dead and never to return . 
  stop dreaming already . 
  none of us want to have anything with commonwealth . 
  was this was sarcasm or should i just facepalm ? 
  chopin is one of my favourites . 
  but in sweden it 's legal to touch someone 's balls ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  soon brother , soon . 
  they tried indeed to [ have us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) . 
   i do see estonia , latvia and lithuania as part of the nordic countries you brought tears of joy to my eyes . 
  most german [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zudtaczkgrs ) ever . 
  i 'm sorry but yes , you just f * cked up when you had a chance . 
  baltics are not slavs , get your shit together amerikieti !, 
  but we 're ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) weird, 
  best brother ever !, 
  the reason is not ukraine why our leaders are not attending . 
  now slovakia is just somebody czech used to know . 
  kebab is very yummy , i eat it everyday . 
  but sweden can into kebab soon, 
  ye and then turkey wants some of your territory might as well leave you alone to short it out right ? 
  usa is n't a threat to its neighbors as much as russia is . 
  go back to your basement if you do n't like social things . 
  only if nordics approve . 
  nice one . 
  only after russia recognizes and apologies for ussr crimes on eastern europe just like germany did for nazi germanys occupation of europe . 
  pretty much . 
  guess that would mean restoring commonwealth just for the sake of survival ( again ) . 
  what ? 
  if russia did n't intervene , ukraines forces would have taken over e. ukraine and crushed the warmongering separatists where they belong . 
   if my grandmother had wheels , she 'd be a streetcar . 
  russia already has its fingers in ukraine , and it has nowhere to go . 
  what ? 
  be afraid of baltics then . 
  rawr . 
  i doubt they would have been homophobes if it was n't for russian occupation . 
  you 're terrible troll . 
   ( this thing was created to separate democratic and communist countries in europe ), 
  give me some of examples how we 're eastern european ? 
  ahem first of all we 're not eastern european ( this thing was created to separate democratic and communist countries in europe ) , on second i never heard that anyone in latvia or estonia would brainwash any russian minority . 
   i think estonia leads in the anti-russian propaganda funding to be honest . 
  and if it 's true , there is a strong reason why they do that . 
  yes , and so was finland , that did n't change its geographical state . 
   besides , i bet the baltics , poland and other countries who 're anti-russian do similar things . 
  you bet on wrong side . 
  we do n't do such things . 
  brother , you have longer history as northern european than eastern european . 
  ussr is the only reason we 're placed in east most of the time . 
  happy independence day brother . 
  glory of the red army . 
  a nuclear state , with nationalists it would be awful thing to happen . 
  all russia need is change of regime which could be friendly towards europe that 's all , nothing more , nothing less . 
  that would be worst case scenario . 
  or just attacked by [ flying sharks with lazers ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/de/a8/64/dea86449a84921020d8862142ecd24ed.jpg ) who magically appeared in baltic sea . 
  i always like to see things like these . 
  lithuania can into colonial empire !, 
  before euro small coins were nightmare . 
  since you know now , be jealous you little burger . 
  ^ ^ jk ^ ^ love ^ ^ you ^ ^ amerikieti, 
  wish war would stop in europe once and for all . 
   nobody complained or acted what do you mean by that ? 
  not really . 
  not a very nice numbers ... for us . 
  since when we were neutral with russia ? 
  it constanly violate our air space , before lng they used their gas company for political purpose . 
  ehem , no . 
  but i know about it from family and friends . 
  as lithuanian , of course i want them . 
  never forget , never forgive . 
  said a guy from russia . 
  hahaha, 
  but we do like amerikonus , stop lying : o, 
  would be fastest and easiest mission . 
  since usa troops already on our soil protecting from ruskies :d, 
  ye , but i think they can survive it . 
  i wish we could help them more . 
  your people should have taken the path we took . 
  sad day for ukraine . 
  i 'm up on union as long as polska is not part of it . 
  most likely latvians , coz baltic brotherhood . 
  we were n't baltic before ? 
  we were occupied by soviet union then nazi germany and again by soviets , jews were n't the only ones that were killed , deported , also lithuanians themselves . 
  nazis themselves wanted to kill/deport 80 % of lithuanian citizens . 
  i do n't get the point you 're saying . 
  good , bdsm lvl, 
  and why would we care ? 
  usa cares , we do n't . 
  damn , i thought only we could get so butthurted .
