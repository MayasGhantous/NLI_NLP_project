   non-real fake country-wannbe !, 
  yet we 're in eu and you 're not :p, 
  only if we 're scandinavian colonies . 
  he can bark about us being in nato and eu as much as he wants . 
  turkey is not a european country to begin with . 
  i agree , but soviet occupation took much more time than nazi occupation . 
  can be both ? 
  never , you can forget it , now we 're just somebody that you used to know . 
  [ besides nordic senpai pls notice us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k%c4%97dainiai ), 
   ordered the slaughter of innocent ** soviets ** in the ** baltics ** what . 
  i understand that soviet word fits but for god sakes , do n't use again that word while mentioning baltic state people , it 's painful to see for us . 
  no difference . 
  still noble . 
  eesti big , lithuania stronk , latvia potatoe ;p, 
  gdl shall reborn one day . 
  he 's talking about if actual invasion ever happens we 're easy targets . 
   a group of lithuanian players recount how humiliating they found it to be referred to as russian when they won olympic gold in 1988 on behalf of the soviet union  many of his friends believe that ukraine , belarus and the baltic states are russian lands and that their independence was an error that needs to be righted one day . 
  and you wonder why we do n't like russians . 
   lapina 's grandfather , an electrical grid engineer , moved to the estonian capital of tallinn in the 1970s -- like many other russians sent to the baltic states as experts . 
  `` they went full of idealism and helped build up and develop the country , and now they 've become occupants , ''  st petersburg , argues that the baltic states enjoyed privileges in soviet times , and says they are ungrateful . 
  `` the baltics had very little industry before the soviet union -- we gave them everything . 
  but now they are throwing it away . '' this just blew my mind . 
  yay , we 're relatives , we can into nordic !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ even ^ ^ ^ ^ though ^ ^ ^ ^ we 're ^ ^ ^ ^ crazy . 
  basketball , the superior sport . 
   the issue is that nato ... has continuously expanded into eastern europe when they had previously been promised it would n't . 
  stop spreading bullsh * t. nato did n't expand , we willingly joined it and happy more when ever being part of it . 
  who said that ? 
  that one looks pertty awesome : http://i.imgur.com/ijwqq8v.png, 
  you 're not the only one protecting our air space . 
  no need to be honest , we know that ourselves . 
  good try , good try . 
  pretty sure ourselves would say that instead of them . 
  this ones look awful . 
  even if it has meaning . 
  why would n't we ? 
  this is n't cold war anymore . 
  we are not occupied by su and we 're part of nato , eu etc. 
  poland is fully western . 
  your words are always twisting my tongue while trying to read it . 
   battle of kircholm this battle should go for lithuanians , since out of 2,600 winged hussars only 200 were polish . 
  but i 'm cool with this since we were part of the same dualistic country back then . 
  good job . 
  you just prove how big and strong of internet keyboard princess , you are . 
  bashing a country that done nothing bad in past . 
  because only eastern part of ukraine is in conflict ? 
  wish russia was like that . 
  both ussr and germany started wwii , both invaded poland at pretty much same time . 
  battle of kircholm , never forget , 
  lithuania would recognize it for sure . 
  excuse me ? 
  we 're helping ukraine with whatever we have in our power . 
  we ca n't just send our `` soldiers '' to stop the conflict ... 
  you know that we ca n't just go and declare war on russia and go all war mode ? 
  this is n't those times where europe slaughter each other or even can anymore . 
  georgia is far and beyond our reach , it barely has any ties with us . 
  do n't compare georgia to ukraine while talking about support . 
  russia was always the reason why we rushed into nato . 
  it was never a safe neighbor . 
  admit what exectly ? 
  you 're not alone my friend . 
  tried french once , i regret it . 
  pretty well made video . 
  you were wrong mikhail gorbachev , we got our independence , you ca n't corrupt people hearts . 
  stay strong ukraine , west and especially us will support your integration into europe and cutting off from russia once and for all . 
  edit : for people who want to know more about january events ( soviet sending tanks ) in lithuania : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_%28lithuania%29, 
  we should say thank you to russia . 
   `` haha americans are dumb and do n't know geography '' we do n't say such a thing anywhere . 
  those are mostly trolls . 
  oh my ... you can speak a bit for turkey , but do n't you dare to speak about europe . 
  we 're not animals . 
  we respect everyone no matter what are their skin color or eye shape . 
   `` hey dmitri ! , guess what ? 
  how narrow minded are you ? 
  no one in lithuania has ever had this name . 
   yeah , because russia is planning on taking over the entire europe . 
  / s you clearly do n't know russias history . 
   it 's a geopolitical and economical conflict between russia and the west , it 's about control and whose pipelines and gas will run where and to what country , and ukraine got caught in the crossfire . 
  and let 's be real , it 's not like america 's any better , just take a look at ttip and ttp , sure they do n't go marching around our countries tearing them apart , but let 's not forget what they 've done with the middle east in the interest of oil . 
  so much bs you just said . 
  what middle east has to do with stuff happening in europe ? 
  whataboutizm much ? 
   there 's no good and evil , there 's bad and worse , and for now america is in some cases a slightly better choice than russia . 
  oh usa is far more greater than russia ever was . 
  they 're not animals who come to rape , murder and shit on your streets , with rolling tanks who crush unarmed people . 
   what i 'd like to see is europe being independent from america and russia , but still allies with both , but i know that 's not happening . 
  ever . 
  we had a glimpse of that with yugoslavia , it was okay with the west and russia . 
  so yeah , eu needs it 's own army so it can stand up for itself whether it 's against america or russia . 
  it 's an ambitious goal , but one can dream , given that for starters most of europeans probably are n't too war mongering or willing to serve in the military . 
  we all want that , but none of us are trying to make it happen . 
  now that 's the army we waited for so long . 
  not pissing off , but making jealous . 
   downvoting this just because he 's black sir , we 're in europe , we do n't do such a thing . 
  from russia as you can see . 
  better later than never . 
  how are we usa 's colony ? 
  because we choose to join military alliance instead sticking on russia 's ass after their rape , murder and occupation of our fatherland ? 
   ** colony **, 
  even if they knew they had no other choice but to leave their own country .
