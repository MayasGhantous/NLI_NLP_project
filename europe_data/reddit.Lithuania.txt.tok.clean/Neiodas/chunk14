  lovely to see usa 's army . 
   yanukovych , a ** pro-russian ** president was ** forced out of office ** . 
  how 's that not aggression ? 
  do n't you think people got enough of following russia into absolute oblivion ? 
  hey babe , baltics are always homogay for usa , 
  to avoid threats like russia is today . 
  you must be pro-putin troll . 
  time changes again . 
   i do n't know who can lie so much . 
  just look at the mirror . 
  well , yeah . 
   svyterus you mean \u0160vyturis ? 
  what the hell ? 
  that 's why movement needs to be started and deeper cooperation between each other than it 's now . 
  well that 's the reason i would go for one person who has ultimate authority . 
  it 's not like that we want to conquer each other . 
  besides people are n't stupid enough to just go and shoot down russian vehicle for no reason , it would be stopped and checked as soon as it crosses border . 
  and on plus side we still work under nato so i do n't see problem in military means . 
  well you know it makes sense to use this kind of flag , latvia and estonia being for long under german rule and lithuania having it 's language revival from east prussia when russian empire banned it , and they brought christianity to us . 
  lithuania and latvia is possible , estonia not so much apparently . 
  though i understand why they do n't want it . 
   but how might such an army work as long as the countries are independent ? 
  who commands it ? 
  who decides when to use it ? 
  there is no difference who commands because it 's meant for one purpose , to repel an invasion into baltic states for as long as possible , so nato could send their own troops to stop the invasion . 
  if russia decides to be a good neighbor , army becomes irrelevant to us and use of it might be over . 
  well talking about language we have english which is already wide spread and taught in baltic states so money is n't getting wasted . 
  and talking about older people well the time when union might happened none speaking people would be already died off probobly so there is no problem for that . 
  besides some benefits are like money pool , which would let us make defense stronger and more ready . 
  a common army , communication would be in english since we already train with other nato country armies , especially usa 's one . 
  talking about stability , well bosnia is different story . 
  besides population would be more than denmark has and it 's one of richest countries in europe . 
  plus talking about government , well we would really need a good system for it , would most likely leave it to estonians since they best out of three in matters of government . 
  well at least this time we 're at the good side . 
  not possible , we would get shadowed again . 
  pagan blood is still in us . 
  may i ask why you think that we would end up like yugoslavia ? 
  they 're same ethnic group , similar language . 
  and they want best for themselves , therefore looking at finland as role model . 
  besides what makes them assholes ? 
  because what you said does n't make them assholes . 
  estonians might be more attached to finland but either way we 're looking more for nordic ( or more specifically scandinavian model of life ) so all three of us are going same path . 
  besides that i really like flag . 
  since it makes sense for latvia and estonia most . 
  personally i would n't mind like riga or tallinn being capitals . 
  maybe because i 'm not much of the fighter . 
  well yeah we do n't want to be liability but it 's not like we choose to have aggressive neighbor so we need what ever help we can get to maintain freedom from monster that russia government is and was . 
  well successful states can transition to small unions ( like scandinavia etc ) if it does n't work for some reason they should have right to go back to previous states . 
  do n't know exectly how this can work but just a thought . 
  i would but it 's impossible as much as i know at the moment . 
  thought i very strongly agree on smaller unions between european countries . 
  can relate to that . 
  ye , you 're right . 
  ca n't tell about estonians or latvians , but i would n't be insulted as much for being called latvian . 
  i would n't say that it 's investment but rather connection between two for traveling purpose . 
  well i do n't really see problem for you being called germans since you have exactly same roots as them . 
  while russians ( slavs ) and lithuanians ( balts ) have barely anything in common . 
  `` you 're russian ? '', 
  about time . 
  if only russia was like canada ... sweet dreams . 
  nice one :d, 
  reunification is impossible at the moment even if they wanted to , economy is way too poor . 
  they need first to deal with transnistria then they need european nations to help fix economy integrate into eu or even nato ( if possible ) and then only if they want to moldavians can make a union with romania ( if they want to , too ) . 
  it 's kind a failed state , but state nonetheless . 
  i really wish our european leaders would be more cold blooded on putin . 
  this is just sad seeing russia yet again killing , raping foreign land . 
  good try , but wo n't work . 
  i agree it 's strange , since the only time i hear russian is when my friends need to say a curse word , since lithuanian curse words are way too passive aggressive , i guess . 
  may i ask how you come with that basic knowledge of basic conversation in russian ? 
  sorry , but we choose richer over-lords :p, 
  it depends how often you use it . 
  i used to study french in high school , i do n't remember even alphabet anymore . 
  shh , you little german in denial . 
  i was more of defender guy ( played romans mostly ) , who was playing with veteran players . 
  won some ltx 's ( lithuanian 3x speed server ) , played some world championships , pretty much got bored after that . 
  even though i met really nice people from all around places in lithuania i feel like i wasted some time . 
  plus i was kind a shocked when i saw how many people like in their 30 's or even married womans play travian on professional level . 
  if you talking about pc games s4 league ( third person shooter ) / fssb ( free style street basketball ) back when i was like 13-16 , counter-strike : source and stronghold : crusader ( mostly played online ) later on and then full transition to league of legends ( 3 years already playing ) and hearthstone . 
  some browser games like travian , ikariam , e-sim , erepublik long time ago . 
  at least you manage to keep your sovereignty , while we got raped by red army . 
  i like you . 
  you do n't know shit about poland . 
  if i were you i would already be leaving this place , because you 're insanely stupid `` troll '' . 
  we just do n't want to border russia . 
  besides i rather see them independent . 
  n-no . 
  sadly some are too lazy and some try to find different path . 
  lithuania and latvian brothers stronk !, 
  trust me we got a quite nice history , not counting that we were minority in our state . 
   ugly flag so mean :(, 
  we already have something like that in our pockets . 
  pretty great . 
  they 're people , but most of them are n't good citizens of a country . 
  probably yes . 
  at the moment i have nothing to lose . 
  that was brilliant !, 
  i 'm so happy to see my country being behind your back guys . 
  people can say what they want about usa , but to us , you 're saviors of precious freedom . 
  hard working and should be proud nation , though we can not exclude wwii thing . 
  i 'm looking at germans as leading nation of eu and i prefer them far more than any british or french or at that matter any other european nation to be in power .
