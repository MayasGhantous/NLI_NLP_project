  we do tell them , the problem is that they do n't care . 
  what are you smoking ? 
  we need to merge again to become more powerful . 
  i 'm talking about name of such as lithuania . 
  lithuania is more than 1000 years old , mate x ), 
  fyi ww2 was started by nazi germany and ussr with invasion of poland . 
  pretty accurate what russians done to it 's former occupied countries . 
  * brofirst * to the old ally, 
  we do but there are some who do n't and still brags about it . 
  because we fallow their model so i 'm actually not surprised . 
  it 's heart warming to see things like this . 
  the city was build mainly by the balts , plus jews , slavs , germans , it was multicultural melting pot ( lithuania and its proper was is small nation ) , but it was capital of gdol neverless , and as successor state of it we 're obligated to have the city into our hands , it 's not like we would start cleansing anyone there , the problem was that poland had inferiority complex to give up vilnius to lithuania so they took it away from us and from centuries as allies we become enemies , even after nazi germany and su attacked you we had dignity to not accept nazi germany 's alliance on attacking you . 
  besides we had no choice but to accept su demands and at least get something out of it ( our historical capital ) . 
  well you had strongest claim for it at that time , now you do n't , stop crying and deal with it . 
  leave those butthurted polish trolls , they do n't want anything but to make enemies . 
  it was done when nazis were occupying us . 
  besides we did n't attack city together with su wtf lol, 
   lithuania , because those countries did n't exist then what ? 
  that will never happen . 
  besides eu opinion is irrelevant when we 're in nato and have our beloved uncle usa to protect us . 
  as long as they keep their claws from vilnius i 'm fine . 
  hate difference in languages  . <, 
  no , but sometimes he keeps an eye on us . 
  just love us . 
  no need to hate us , we done nothing wrong !, 
  snap , we really need to catch up . 
  you estonia so cute when you 're passive-aggressive . 
  it 's very possible to create movement for it since latvia and lithuania are very similar in almost everything , if language is no problem ( looking at belgium , switzerland etc ) i really wish to see this in future . 
  i wish one thing is that latvia and lithuania unite , since we 're balt bro 's . 
  would make everything easier , though language barrier would be a problem at beginning . 
  well even though i should say lithuania as lithuanian i really like estonia because it looks like it 's most serious from all three of us . 
  not possible , not gon na happen and not really needed . 
  what , vilnius was settled and long belonged to lithuanian state . 
  poland has no rights and never had to this region . 
  well at first you wanted to kill us all ( teutons came )  .  plus polish nobles delayed crown until it was too late , so lithuania never became kingdom again . 
  have a happy day on `` victory '' finland , wish you best . 
  even though us on other hand were n't so lucky . 
  russia is testing nato at same time , like they always do . 
  oh yeah , i think there is a good reason for that . 
  not counting history . 
  constant air space violation by russian jets , so please , they deserve being antagonized . 
   west already betrayed them by expand nato in the east . 
  this always crack me up . 
  by this time it should been known fact . 
  i do n't understand why you 're getting down-voted , you 're right . 
  no surprise , russia will think twice before poking something of similar size . 
   lets face it russia and putin have more ability more ability to sway world affairs with an economy the size of italy than all of europe put together . 
  one is authoritarian state , other is just economic union with few dozen voices who say their own opinion . 
  [ i thought you guys dreamed about it , did n't you ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ), 
  how the hell you expect me to know that you 're danish . 
  you have canadian flair so i assume you 're canadian . 
  might as well start writing little text under your flair . 
  you wish . 
  yeah we also have these called `` marozai '', 
  it 's popular among chavs or marozai here to eat sunflower seeds . 
  you 're not even european , let alone from eurozone , do not insult our great currency . 
  where is eagle ? 
   well , we call our both parents t\u0117vai . 
  so we call our parents homies ? 
  t\u0117vyn\u0117 comes from word t\u0117vas which is father . 
  so it 's more literal translate as fatherland rather than homeland . 
  both words are equally fine to use . 
  become constitutional monarchy , we will get you a king and we will be able to have that handsome flag of our past . 
  beautiful as always . 
  quite strange when we call our land - fatherland . 
  moldovan is romanian language just different name for it . 
  yes , at least `` litas '' was pegged to euro years before joining in 2015 . 
  is there any grills ? 
  those are two completely different things . 
  i and people i know do not give single sh * t about russians , they 're just normal people after all , at least those which i met , anyway what you can hear is only stuff like putler/kremlin that 's all . 
  and media , well media is just media , they use what ever words to attract viewers . 
  i do n't think any one is hating russia or russians , but putin and high command officials who are doing stupid sh * t. 
  do n't care about him , care about us , because we love you !, 
  this so called refugees could have stopped and lived their lives without terror in turkey already . 
  these are economic migrants no more , no less , we do n't need people that do not intend to stay here . 
  middle class still exists in russia !, 
   tell that to the russians who ended up in estonia and do not have a passeport these russians , refuse to learn estonian which is a key to passport . 
  and their `` grey '' passport gives them more benefits at the moment than having actually estonian passport . 
   russians do n't give a fuck about finland so why would they care about estonia ? 
  because russia at those times [ failed to occupy finland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) . 
  while estonia was sweet innocent land that is easily accessible like rest of baltics were . 
   when german soldiers came to lithuania your people welcomed them with open arms as liberators . 
  before realizing you were n't any better than soviets . 
   russia should not be underestimated , especially you should know that . 
  russia is not underestimated . 
  russia is just merely a regional power , calling russia superpower would make a lot of other countries superpower . 
  it 's just laughable . 
   ** us using ** nato as the envelope to ** push it 's geopolitical influence over europe ( troops and military bases ) ** and later other parts of the world ( afghanistan successfully , iraq less so ) ... last time i remember eastern europe themselves beg for usa bases . 
   while seeking to isolate russia from the west . 
  russia is doing that by herself . 
  usa barely has anything to do with it . 
   major point being , nato has n't done anything the us has n't done , which only implies it only serves as an extension of us foreign policy , not as a real treaty organization where the other members actually mattered . 
  we ( ex-commie bloc ) sure are more than happy that usa is leading nato , since w. europe is far less trustful as they mostly try to kiss russia ass no matter what . 
  and it works just fine with us , you attack us , you attack americans , it 's very good deterrence . 
   what did nato done good for italians ? 
  it 's an alliance whose purpose is to secure american interests . 
  i would n't say nato is fully americans interest alliance , there are countries that hell are thankful being in . 
  but yeah , well nato 's purpose before fall of ussr was to defend italy from ussr , today i do n't really see why you should be in , out side maybe invoking article v if terrorist attack happens on italian soil . 
   the us has over 100 military installations , 7 major bases and 12,000 troops in my country since the end of ww2 .
