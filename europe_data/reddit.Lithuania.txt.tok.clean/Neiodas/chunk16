  might as well send them to us - the baltics :3, 
  what did nato done bad for italians that they deserve your hate ? 
   europe , home of the great empires who shaped the world . 
  yeah third reich was great empire who wanted to shape world in their own views , who 's next , ussr , such long lost great empire who left only ~ ~ abomination ~ ~ paradise as it 's legacy like n. korea . 
  / s  mercy of two superpowers okay usa is superpower , but who 's second ? 
  what a joke . 
  russia would say anything just to make sure surrounding countries are not protected from their influence . 
  which are ? 
  tea is master race . 
  what did ukraine done bad to russia ? 
  from sadness to laughters . 
  well played , well played . 
   hungarian , finnish , estonian , and basque also are n't indo-europeans . 
  they share a lot of history and ethnic mixing with other european nations and basque is actually original european people that lived here since very beginning . 
   what is your definition of ethnicity ? 
  this is completely arbitrary . 
  being prominently white . 
   what values do europeans share ? 
  you 'd be hard pressed to find some . 
  serbians , for example , have very very different values than scots . 
  serbians have far more common with scots than turkey will ever have with those above . 
  this is useless to keep discussing . 
  can you not just deal with a fact that turkey is far from ever being european nation . 
   bosnia , albania , and kosovo share a religion . 
  they fit criteria as having european culture , being on european continent and are european by genes , and language , difference is that they 're just muslims plus their religion is different from other muslims in middle-east . 
   turkish is an official language of cyprus and a recognized minority language in bosnia , greece , kosovo , macedonia , and romania . 
  they do n't belong to indo-european language group . 
   i do n't see how this applies . 
  if so , then hungarians , finns , and estonians also would not be europeans . 
  these ethnic group lived on european soil for thousands of years , therefore , europeans . 
   turkish values are n't all that far off from the rest of the balkans , given that the balkans and turkey share a history . 
  that 's called common culture not values . 
  was the eastern roman empire not european ? 
  i 'd surely say it was , even though it lost most of its european territory in the high middle ages . 
  what next , kazakhstan is also european nation ? 
  just because you have little piece of land in europe does n't make you european nation . 
   well that 's too bad because i call it a european nation . 
  i 'm not alone . 
  what a joke . 
   first of all , just because i 'm american does n't make me ignorant . 
  it was mean from me , yeah , i 'm sorry . 
   secondly , why do n't you explain how turkey is n't asia instead of calling names ? 
  as far as i 'm aware , that 's the classic tactic used when you do n't have the means necessary to challenge my argument with facts . 
  you do n't need to be smart-ass to know why turkey most likely never have access to eu , and what most important be called as european nation . 
  turkey 's religion , language , ethnic group , ** values ** and what most of all keeps out of europe is geographical location . 
  you can defend turkey for being more western than any other middle-eastern country , but it will never , ever be called european nation . 
  thing is those are in europe , turkey is n't . 
   how is n't turkey european ? 
  turkish history is european history . 
  ignorant american at it 's root . 
  you know nothing jon snow . 
  must be austrian also . 
  oh sh * t did n't knew estonia , latvia , belarus , ukraine and etc had empires ?!, 
  holy molly, 
  true on that , when ever i see cops searching who 's making drugs clients mostly say they get it from gypsy ghettos . 
  poor estonia . 
  okay ex-spanish territory . 
  how is atlantic ocean ? 
  is it warm this time of year ... ? 
   it is also a term in political sense , and since this article is about politics not geography ... last time i remember we 're democratic , capitalist free countries since 1989-1991 . 
  it 's cold war term for communist countries that were under ussr iron fist . 
  w. europe media still uses this comparison even though communism and ussr died few decades ago , it kind a reminds us dark past and it makes little to no sense any more , it 's not cold war , why use term that was used in those times . 
  geographically it does n't make any sense , it just purely ex-idealogical term . 
  eu is not dominated by usa . 
   but so evil was germany in history and paid great price for it , it has learned from past mistakes and now is an ally , russia never learns and never will . 
  it was n't because of nato , it was because of eu . 
  and eu brings a lot better conditions for nation to grow into better society , which russian top snakes fear , that people will want to get rid of ruling heads that sold their soul as faust did to the devil . 
   kaliningrad is since the end of ww2 the base of the baltic fleet , actually completely surrounded by countries in nato . 
  so since this one the most important part of russian military with over hundreds of vessels they have no right be militarized ? 
  they have every right to militarise it , things is they bitch ten times more about ten times lesser presence of nato troops in baltics . 
   are you for real ? 
  countries were basically in crumbles with no economy left , they were desperate and they had only that option to accept usa helps , and usa knowing that played their game to impose their presence in europe with ** military bases ** . 
  thing is that nato members that were former soviet satellites and occupied republics beg themselves for nato and especially usa bases to deter any russian invasion . 
   wait , wait , wait . 
  you are justifying the presence of military bases and nuclear weapons from usa near russia because one single spy was kidnapped ? 
  i already explained why military bases are needed . 
  and i do n't see any nuclear weapons on russian border ...  you do n't even know what were the early plans of usa for russia when ussr collapsed , your goddamn governors and military in the 1990 had even plans to split russia in a way that siberia would become another country and then in a way to get the natural resources in there . 
  where do you get this from ? 
  for real . 
   and when russia threatened to invade europe ? 
  many times , some clowns in duma were saying we 're going back into russia forcefully , so please . 
  few years back russia and ukraine were best buddies and allies , few years passed and now they 're eternal enemies . 
  russia did n't change , what makes you think they 're worthy as an ally ? 
  they never were , they have always had their own intentions with their special ideals . 
  we 're small and barking , yes , but we 're ones that know russia best with other neighbours that actually been under their iron fist . 
   oh please , nato has never done anything aggressive towards russia in the last 25 years around his borders , yeah ? 
  tell me one thing nato done something bad to russia ? 
  last time i remember they 're the ones bitching about us making stronger deterrence from making `` classic '' russian break away region , countering their propaganda and etc. 
  not surprised , russia is well known for having it 's own intentions in syria . 
  but i do n't find this being relevant that lithuania rejects alliance with russia ( well i guess history comes here too ) , it wo n't change a damn thing . 
  you know nothing with your fresh baked acc . 
  asking the important questions i see . 
  is n't it 4 maybe 5 stars , since army is n't included ? 
  can confirm . 
  damn we were fascists before fascism was even a thing . 
  [ prepare yourself brother , for what comes to you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/afgymvd.png ) :\\ ^ ), 
  happy independence day , best neighbour to have around . 
  no way . 
   would you approve of using nato military forces to attack crimeans and force them back into ukraine ? 
  even if for example russia would n't intervene .
