  because population of crimea and especially sevastopol would put hell of a fight ... of course not wtf that does n't change a fact that russia invaded , annexed sovereign territory breaking international law and trust . 
  leaving it unpunished hard soon might give pretext to annex part of latvia . 
  true , my bad . 
  your fans did quite of damage here , last time they were around . 
  : / ( if you 're from part of england ), 
  do armenian 's ask for compensate on that though ? 
  if not why the hell not make apology , not like it 's going to hurt you or anything quite contrary , since it 's already known . 
  not long ago english fans were here , they did stereotypical stuff , got drunk and started to smash stuff in bar which costed quite lot for owner . 
  france going to invade turkey ? 
  i mean it 's truly sad what gaotf * ckers done to your country and this act by turkish fans is truly awful thing to do . 
  in this thread i never said they wanted to have western values , our own values are already giving us headache any way . 
  besides in lithuania some turkish got his kebab store put on fire by molotov cocktails by drunk lithuanian 's . 
  most football fans are also drunk cunts , what did you really expect them to do , debate on global peace ? 
   no can we blame them for electing erdogan ? 
  probably , but we elect quite some good part of dumb politicians also . 
   that should be enough not to let them anywhere near the eu . 
  really liked the secular turkey but the eu fucked that up by backing erdogan in eliminating the protector of a secular turkey ( the army ) . 
  true but there is nothing we can do . 
  and they were n't really near eu even before that . 
  what i wanted to say turkey as a whole had nothing to do with it , while those `` football fans '' are disgrace for this world . 
  excuse me ? 
  some * football fans are well known being assholes . 
   easy hands on what foreign territories ? 
  russia is busy in syria and as long as the situation in ukraine is stable , i see no reason to keep the sanctions up . 
  such place called crimea . 
  it 's football match , i do n't really want to blame whole turkey since polish football fans also do big disrespect towards lithuanian 's with `` wilno naszne '' - `` vilnius is ours '' or [ `` lame lithuanians bow before your polish lords '' ] ( http://gs.delfi.lt/images/pix/lietuvius-izeidziantis-plakatas-paznanes-stadione-62038691.jpg ), 
   ... we should ally with russia ... no more sanctions ... 
  so let 's give russia easy hands on foreign territories for free ? 
  today i met sweet girls who took part in action about awareness of international students day and czechoslovakia 's student rebel against nazi germany 's occupation . 
  i do n't really think we ever did anything bad , even back in grand duchy of lithuania days or plc days . 
  that was done by soviets . 
  i love you both . 
   lil lietuva it 's only temporary [ ^ soon \u2122 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/lithuanian_state_in_13-15th_centuries.png/800px-lithuanian_state_in_13-15th_centuries.png ) meanwhile in lr [ seimas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7edeoeuxdmu#t=09s ), 
  same repeating history , paranoia and unwilling to cooperate as true ally . 
   association of former empires who ' v learned from the failings of the age of colonialism . 
  erm . 
  lietuva can into glorious past domination !, 
  it 's 2015 , and over here we have the internet . 
  please no , i do n't want to be part of ussr again , noooooooooooooo !, 
  i 'd like to know why ? 
  aka nordics . 
  europe full of weird geographical shapes . 
  what ? 
  why does it even matter ? 
  and who the hell said we want to be nordic ? 
  lol, 
  say hi to polar bears from me . 
  we 're not united enough . 
  [ wolfs are cool , helped us to build our capital . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_wolf_\\ ( character \\ ) ), 
  ussr would have perished if not western europe . 
  lol, 
  it was n't russia , it was ussr . 
  is n't that what they always say when we bring up terrible things done by entity ? 
  otherwise it 's time for them to pay reparations for occupation , give back stolen stuff etc. 
  happy independence day ex-bff !, 
   basically this quotation fro . 
  pi\u0142sudski wait , did he really said that ?!, 
  guess some inner `` lithuanian-part of interwar '' was still awaken in him . 
  because you did n't want us to be equal again . 
   alarm f\u00fcr cobra 11 was very popular in lithuania . 
  yes , it 's , i 'm not going to argue . 
  only after baltic states made illegal secession . 
  i 'm not comparing ussr to spain , i 'm comparing future of being independent catalonia . 
   self-sufficient nazi germany wanted to be one ... 
  there is no self-sufficient country in europe , everyone needs someone for something else . 
  it 's 50/50 either you get on track like we did after leaving rotten ussr or get yourself nowhere just like ukraine and belarus is today . 
  feels bad man . 
  most lol pro-players are thin or have muscle on them , very few are actually fat . 
  i think it depends on a game . 
  it was only beginning of it . 
  very great news indeed . 
  i 'm fan of competitive gaming since 2011 and i 'm having great experience knowing esport scene is growing to even higher level . 
  esports - electronic sports . 
  same like sports , only done on video games who are heavily competitive and requires tons of practice . 
  same . 
  r/russia is full of troll acc 's nothing special . 
   why do you keep bothering us then if you do n't want to have anything to do with russia ? 
  could you give some examples on how we 're doing it ? 
   he is a pragmatic man . 
  he wants to stay in power and capturing any state would collapse the russian economy . 
  plus , it 's obviously more beneficial to trade with you . 
  well true , but he 's sure hated and kind of feared here . 
   well , i did n't mean to offend you , it 's just when someone calls you an ignorant fuck , you do n't really give too much thought about your choice of words . 
  but all right , if you find it offensive , i will delete that part . 
  it 's alright you were n't wrong , but soviet past is probably darkest times of our past . 
   my god , do you seriously think russia needs your swamps and forests ? 
  well sure you do n't when your whole country is actually swamp and forest , but putin sure thinks about it while he sucking every last bit of blood from russia . 
   you can keep the destroyed soviet factories . 
  we do n't mind . 
  why do you point out soviet ? 
  without soviet we would been even more richer and would have had better infrastructure and everything over all . 
  it was lithuanian there is no doubt in that , but it was multi-cultural , bilingual state after expansion to east and south . 
   kuril islands will be returned to japan i doubt japan wants back-ward region who is great burden . 
   koenigsberg to germany yet again , no germans left , bombed and built by shitty soviet structures , not worth it , they even refused to get it back . 
   and some money to baltics . 
  if russia falls there wo n't be any money to pay us , it 's unrealistic that russia would ever accept it 's terrible past . 
  being nato and eu is greatest thing that protects us from ~ ~ russian ~ ~ putins claw . 
  that face does n't fit at all what was written ... 
  both .
