  i feel disturbance in balance when i have to sit next to someone in bus . 
  alcohol does fix that . 
  seeing lithuania in third place by who ... well sh * t. 
  well , welcome to cold north . 
  bring them all here . 
  but ... but ... swedes are nr . 
  1 investors into lithuania ... nvm , fuck the b\u00f6rk !, 
  deluge never forget !, 
  shut up b\u00f6rkenstein . 
  brother ? 
  look who 's talking . 
  lol, 
   gayropa hilarious that they 're sh * t talking about continent they live themselves . 
  after we annex you < 3, 
  savage . 
  former british colony of amerika . 
  nah , we should have made klaip\u0117da our new capital so we would fit with nordics and rest of baltic 's . 
   wait i thought poland-lithuania was predominantly catholic back in the day ? 
  poland was , us ( lithuanians ) not so much . 
  yes . 
  vytis ' stance always give shivers . 
  after you rename yourself gerpoleland . 
  it sound great and yummy !, 
  okay lenkija . 
  it is just a theory , etymology of lithuania is still not known . 
   i 'm a germanist . 
  i thought i was the only one . 
  i do n't think it matters for us , if they meant baltics or balts , we 're both anyway . 
  that 's how romans called balts/baltics . 
  litva [ n ] such an ugly name , sorry , i do n't want to see it happening . 
  let 's just unite with latvia and call ourselves federation of aestii . 
  that sounds more latvian than lithuanian . 
  oh hello great-great-great-grandpa . 
  yes . 
  the shape represent [ gediminas ' tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gediminas%27_tower ) . 
  english is actually our lingua franca now , only that russian is still alive between older folks . 
  only with older folks that were born in ussr times . 
  that 's what ama_deo would say about lithuania . 
  beautiful . 
  fair enough . 
   common misconception , schengen treaty only removes physical checking of ids on the borders . 
  anyone country in the eu automatically has the right for its citizens to move to any other eu country , regardless of whether they are in schengen or not . 
  true , ca n't argue with that . 
   germany is certainly doing exactly that . 
  france is too scared to say anything , britain is ostracised by everyone , poland would be a dwarf compared to turkey . 
  turkey would be too powerful . 
  that 's pure eu 's flaw which has to be fixed somehow . 
   when we joined the union , we understood that the `` united in diversity '' meant european diversity . 
  we will gladly share an union with the irish , the portugese , etc. 
  but we will not share a union with turkey , or russia , or china , or nigeria , you name it . 
  that 's our choice . 
  we do have a veto on new members . 
  what about cyprus ? 
  geographically out of europe 's reach but culturally european , if turkey has same values as any other european state why not having her by our side , does religion really matter that much ? 
  besides , what do you have against russia , as much as we hate their leaders and politics , russians are europeans and will always be . 
  that 's why i and other fellow sub-redditor of europe pointed out about turkeys full westernization in order to have chance to become a member state of eu . 
  before turkey becomes eu i 'm pretty sure there should n't be any turkish army in northern cyprus . 
   your english is really hard to understand . 
  i 'm sorry for that , i 'm really sleepy at the moment and thought of taking a nap . 
   the presence of a rapidly growing muslim country that would be the largest country in the eu and thus one of the most powerful ? 
  i 'd say at least 50 % of current eu members would not want to be part of that union and would leave . 
  czech republic would do so immediately without any doubt what so ever . 
  erm ? 
  what 's wrong having islamic state in union , it 's economical purpose to have them , without being in schengen area their population would n't matter . 
  being `` powerful '' does n't mean that turkey can use eu for it 's own personal use , we have turkey , france , britain , soon poland with ee block at her side . 
   i 'd say at least 50 % of current eu members would not want to be part of that union and would leave . 
  czech republic would do so immediately without any doubt what so ever . 
  here goes `` united in diversity '' motto away . 
   including germany , france , netherlands , hungary , poland , czech republic , slovakia , greece and many others . 
  and their reasons are for that ? 
  `` they 're muslims , therefore they 're evil '' ? 
   what downfall ? 
  what happened `` the last time your country had this '' ? 
  i 'm just mixed up regions . 
  do n't mind it . 
   and not allowing turkey is the only way the eu can survive . 
  most of the countries would just leave if turkey was somehow admitted . 
  what would turkey do that would destroy eu ? 
   i fully support westernization of turkey , but they just wo n't ever be in the eu , that 's just something they have to accept . 
  if fully westernized turkey ever lives on what would hold back it from eu ? 
  butt-hurt greeks ? 
  or another balkan nation ? 
  one of main reasons for downfall . 
  not allowing turkey into eu is stupid idea , instead of denying might as well help to what ataturk started and always wanted . 
   moravia i 'm sorry i thought you 're one of polish regions , that 's why i pointed out plc. 
  ~ ~  each country has a veto ~ ~ ~ ~ do n't you remember what happened to our country last time we had this . 
   turkey has been trying to get into eu for my whole life and it is pretty evident that eu would rather keep turkey at it 's doorstep acting as a barrier between the middle-east , rather than integrate the country into the union . 
  well even though it 's sad to see turkey waiting for so long to get in to eu i see it happening when eu actually stops being mass-opinion-clusterf * ck . 
  as much as eu is good for us it could be better . 
  even though not being in eu you 're too valuable and strategic ally to let go so do n't worry maybe in 2139 you will be in eu . 
  :\\ ^ )  personally i would love if turkey got into eu so i can leave and live in a place where personal liberties would n't turkey need to apply for [ schengen area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area ) access ? 
  after becoming eu state . 
  [ yes . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_omon_assaults_on_lithuanian_border_posts ) plus : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania ), 
  well there are reasons why you 're not accepted into eu . 
  but if you asked my opinion i would love to see turkey in eu . 
   is it time to get turkey out of nato ? 
  usa herself would n't let that happen , guess why . 
   maybe for arts and crafts :d was it for halloween ? 
  both .
