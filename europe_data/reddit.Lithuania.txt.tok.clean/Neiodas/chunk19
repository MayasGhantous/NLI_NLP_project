   i do n't remember if my class ever did . 
  it 's a lot fun then we in primary school were in competition who made scariest pumpkin face . 
  british english is european english . 
  prepare for bombings 2.0, 
  but we used to carve pumpkins in primary school ; ( long time ago, 
  why do you say that like it 's a bad thing . 
  you can fix that by making lithuanian-latvian commonwealth . 
  as stupid and harsh it sounds without it we would been balkans 2.0, 
  seeing two lithuanians trying to fight over who post faster a good picture looks cute . 
  well this sounds bad , now i see reason behind your nickname . 
   you actually said all of mainland europe . 
   which does n't include scandinavia , britain or the us ... as englishman you ca n't write jack shit in english . 
   while connected , scandinavia is n't referred to as mainland europe . 
  that still does n't change my point and fact . 
   scandinavia is connected to mainland . 
   or the us us is in europe ... til ... 
  never have i ever seen anyone being racist here where i live , not even in other cities i have been to in lithuania . 
  also gta vc with them sniper rifle making moon bigger . 
  what 's wrong with you honestly ? 
  i just stated why i thought he was russian and it 's still not enough for you . 
  why are you trying to create useless conversation out of useless topic . 
  dmitri is very common russian name and that 's all . 
   so in your mind lithuanians are somehow morally superior to russians . 
  go drink your pills . 
  you do n't know what word `` racism '' stands for , and my comment is n't hating on whole ethnicity , it 's generalise because of his name `` dmitri '' . 
  i expected him to be smart enough to use google before writing his sentence out of his ass . 
  excuse me ? 
  moldovans and romanians are same ethnic group with same spoken language , while lithuania and latvia are balts who speak baltic language , not slavic like poland or russia . 
  your statement is ignorant and without any logic . 
  guess who fund them . 
  well moldavian 's are pretty much ceded romanians . 
   russia is part of europe , we can not just wish them away ; this is the reality of the situation . 
  perhaps being an american on the other side of the ocean your vision is clouded and you are able to be as zealous and uncompromising as you seem to be advocating the eu to be . 
  but i live in europe , a continent that includes russia whether i like it or not . 
  problem is russia sees herself less european everyday , not other way around . 
   demonising them and ** militarising the eu 's / natos borders ** will not help anyone , i want a balance between keeping eastern european union countries safe and showing ** russia ** that they can ** work with us through diplomacy ** . 
  it will help us to become more safe . 
  russia and diplomacy do n't work together if you ever took a look onto russia 's history . 
   is n't that veto pretty much a reciprocal move ? 
  are poles recognized as minorities with appropriate language laws in germany and lithuania ? 
  i do n't know much about it . 
  i heard we 're fixing it . 
   from what i hear , in lithuania poles ca n't even keep their original names and they have to change them to more lithuanian versions . 
  yes , it 's true . 
  but even if you made it more lithuanian it would still retain traces of your surname in polish since some letters are meaningless like w ( polish ) instead of v ( lithuanian ) . 
  no , not at all . 
  he 's probably speaking about non-eu/nato post-soviet countries , especially those in central asia . 
  lithuanians and our media does n't target polish or even russian minority , but they target exactly tomaszewski , he 's reason why polsih minority `` has problems '' here . 
  i do n't think he 's here to make friends . 
  welcome to lithuania , where pro-kremlin c * nt do anything in his hands to maintain some kind of influence even if it means using both minorities for his own gain . 
  ah , our great and glorious slang . 
   my dad describes architecture he does n't like as polish and gets really livid about it . 
  hearing about it he 's all for lithuanian superiority and enslaving the poles , but really ... he just really does n't like ** polish architecture ** there is no such a thing ... 
  thank you for your respond , was really interesting !, 
  name sounds almost like if he was lithuanian ... 
   anyway - do you agree with my statement , or not ? 
  your statement would been fine if you noted that it was in plc , in gdl , ruthenian was only widely used because of all that ruthenian land we incorporated into gdl . 
   what language was used in gdl at that time ? 
  at beginning lithuanian , after expansion ruthenian and lithuanian ( also german , latin etc ) . 
   ruthenian became the main language of ** documentation and writings ** , especially in ** eastern and southern parts of the duchy ** . 
  is bavaria like austria 2.0 ? 
  i heard it speaks same dialect ( ? ), 
  is n't it ? 
  because lithuanian language did n't had it 's written form , which is why we adopted ruthenian . 
  why not lithuania , specifically klaip\u0117da / memel city , it has same architecture like old prussia , you would feel like home . 
  i would n't say he 's communist , but rather populist who wants money from both sides by doing nothing . 
  he 's pro-kremlin puppet , who tries to create problems as much as he can so he could be elected by polish and russian minority while promising something but never delivering . 
  again i have no idea how he still stands in politics . 
  that 's all , all these problems you hear about street names and polish minority last names on passports are created by him . 
  we do , but that does n't change the fact that they have more in common with you than us . 
  but we only had wars between each other . 
  you share far more history and culture with them . 
  if poland was n't a dick after ww1 i 'm pretty sure we would say ourselves poland is our best buddy . 
  you forgot german prussians themselves stole clay from old prussians ( baltic ) . 
  even when it 's written in lithuanian it 's hard to read - '' \u017de\u010dpospolita '' . 
  your language seems too hard for a daily life . 
  always victim ... 
  waldemar tomaszewski is main reasons why your minority has `` issues '' . 
  he brings up quite irrelevant topics that would n't change anything of daily lives , he 's there to create anger or fear between each other , our media long ago talks what are these guys tasks , it 's been revealed that he uses money for his own gain and i do n't understand how in the hell he happens to hold still in politics . 
  trust me on this , your minority is not in danger or any discrimination , this all but a bubble who was created by media to gain views . 
  everyone knows it 's latvia . 
  well austria and prussia ( later german empire ) were n't friendliest of neighbours , at least that was my first thought when we talk about two . 
  latvia never did anything wrong to us and is ally , and fellow balt . 
  well this sounds bad ... 
  but i wonder why we 're [ one of the most tallest ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9o3eytdm8lqyjdnt3dcu21bvku/edit ) people in europe when we 're pretty much tied our long ass history with poland and rest of ee ... 
  while you and estonia were ruled for centuries by germans , and got colonized by them a bit before ww2 end . 
  oh , never knew about it . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  come to baltics and become baltic-german as your strongest ancestors were !, 
  enjoy nice women , we have good beer also and fast internet !, 
  what you are waiting for , just hop on first plane . 
  ^ ^ ^ heheheheh, 
  maybe ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  you have never met russians then who are from russia . 
  that 's nr . 
  1 rule of war , to make your population hate your enemy , nothing special , russia is prime example through centuries . 
  together , we shall name it kingdom of baltia . 
  i wrote my sentence like true retard , i 'm sorry . 
  yeah i knew this one . 
  good old times , stabmeld\u017eiai rules !,
