  you really really do n't want to provoke a world-ending event like that , and these sabre-rattling idiots in turkey are making me nervous . 
  wow you 're such russophil troll . 
  nato is n't pushing , countries are joining because of fear of russian invasion . 
  this russian expansion only gives more reasons to join nato asap , after they threatened . 
  what sabre-rattling idiots in turkey ? 
  last time i remember you violated their air-space . 
  from israel flair you changed to estonian , stop trolling mate , you 're terrible at it . 
  they black mailed a lot . 
  and prices were highest before we built lng . 
  yeah , yeah . 
  it 's not about price , but about shutting down gas if something `` russophobic '' happens . 
  i never said it 's an excuse , but it 's hypocrisy from both sides . 
  terrible logistics ; who would command ? 
  ; would some european countries who have nothing to do with other european country over-sea territories go to war and fight for it ? 
  just do some research and you will understand . 
  to build euto would require a lot of time and preparation , and there is no need for euto while nato exists , besides i 'm happy that nr . 
  1 military in the world got our back from invasion , baltics will always welcome americans with warm hands and flowers here . 
  russia ca n't black mail any more if we buy from west rather than east . 
  we should make a lot more projects with poland . 
  it feels bad when so much shared history , culture and so on , and yet post-ww1 made us not much of even friends any more . 
  ;( but nice to see some projects being done and going for both well being . 
  grandpa drink your pills . 
  i do n't think you know what is nato , fellow redditor . 
  good joke mate , good job . 
  i trust more nato or for that matter usa far more than i would ever trust euto - this thing is an impossible task to even exist in first place . 
  it does , but i do n't really see reason for austria to join nato , unless germany might want to ... re-unite ... 
  it 's not but problem is ussr was doing ethnic cleansing also , yet it is denied by russia till this day while blaming others of past mistakes . 
  russia always bitch 's about `` nazi '' `` atrocities '' baltics did . 
  my first thought was that actually . 
  hehehe, 
  no , but you do the same . 
  i rather pay money to an ally than to an enemy . 
  being neutral and stuff , since start of cold war . 
  we need to use cuteness of eesti to make sad suomija to join glorious nato . 
  true , but i just can not believe that questions that has obvious answers are asked . 
  it 's not about tensions but about historical name meaning . 
  are you really that stupid ? 
  germans are our allies for long time now , while russians constantly violate our air space , tried to manipulate us with gas price and so on . 
   it is so strange when lithuanians talk to each other in english why ? 
  this is english speaking sub-reddit , otherwise we would see dclauzel `` zombie apocalypse '' . 
  penguins were ice giants all along !, 
  people forgetting that ussr was also a bad guy who invaded first before nazis both baltics and finland . 
  edit : plus they invaded poland together with nazis . 
  americans are always welcome here :d, 
   i just looked up some pictures and lithuania has some beautiful sites it 's about sucking money not how beautiful place is . 
  might as well become ethiopia soon after immigration crisis . 
  can relate to that . 
  terrible sarcasm it 's then . 
  maybe . 
  jesus , you did n't get sarcasm ... 
  yes . 
  agree on this . 
  the thing is those most politicians were born under ussr and `` our '' lingua franca was russian . 
  after it 's fall we started fast integration into western values etc. 
  we transitioned our lingua franca from russian to english now . 
  give it few more decades and you will see huge rise on english speaking people down here . 
  belarus was never grand duchy and never held this title unlike finland . 
   larger state luxembourg much big , much stronk !, 
  we have ... erm ... erm ... fresh water fields !, 
  because scots are what we would have became if we actually were still in union with poland . 
  my guess , 
  but ... but ... 
  i 'm surrounded by non-homophobes , how can this be . 
  your language is dying and has no way on it 's come-back , just deal with it already , will you ? 
  belarus was never an independent nation before 1991 though . 
  and we work as clown now . 
  or robin for batman ... 
  if we go with sense-less stereotypes might as well shut up `` ivan the vodka lover '' . 
  belarus = / = gdl , grand dukes were ethnic lithuanian 's only , even though whole of belarus ( gudija or white ruthenia ) was incorporated into gdl . 
  so it 's wrong description to say he can be grand duke . 
  \u0160i\u0161 , swamp germans . 
  hope russia wo n't invade us again or we shall sieg heil with flowers germans again . 
   what 's not to like ? 
  british food . 
  thank you dear lenkiukas for explanation , we will try to act less tsundere next time towards you . 
  hehehe, 
  all we need is to become part of the commonwealth , we have experience in it anyway . 
   ** lithuania ** : in the eu , in europe , ** a country ** god dammit poland . 
  your flag is awesome , i wish we had flag like yours . 
  he 's half kraut , half frog , he can be whoever he wants . 
  well instead of getting enslaved into their dungeons we fought them back with our big dongs . 
  great trolling mate , but you failed . 
  proud pagan . 
   poland and lithuania underwent an alternating series of wars and alliances during the 14th century and early 15th century . 
  several agreements between the two ( the union of krak\u00f3w and vilna , the union of krewo , the union of vilnius and radom , the union of grodno , and the union of horod\u0142o ) were struck before the permanent 1569 union of lublin . 
  this agreement was one of the signal achievements of sigismund ii augustus , last monarch of the jagiellon dynasty . 
  sigismund believed he could preserve his dynasty by adopting elective monarchy . 
  his death in 1572 was followed by a three-year interregnum during which adjustments were made to the constitutional system ; these adjustments significantly increased the power of the polish nobility and established a truly elective monarchy . 
  well danes are germanic , so ... 
  vilnius was lithuanian since xiv c. till 1795 . 
  and after 1920 you showed huge dick move . 
  i guess it 's in your blood since you 're slavic . 
  do not trigger me . 
  but most of us are tall and blonde , why ca n't you love us eesti ? 
  do n't forget to form united federal nation to counter-weight other countries !, 
  step aside jesus , perk\u016bnas is in the house . 
  hope none of british or american soldier will need to fall . 
  time to change that . 
  litwa and gudija shall unite one day . 
  we should also rename ourselves as republic of central lithuania .
