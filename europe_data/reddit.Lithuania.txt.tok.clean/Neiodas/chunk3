  feelsbadman then you speak one of two last surviving baltic languages . 
  how nice of you , still believing in third reich propaganda . 
  lithuanian army was delayed and actually came only in aftermath of battle . 
  but since we were one country - \u017de\u010dpospolita , i guess you 're partly right . 
  what does that suppose to mean ? 
  what kind of brain-wash you see here ? 
  our elite sold their culture and language in favour of yours for some extra privileges . 
  not really . 
  but i guess it 's alright . 
  what can i say we got our [ revenge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ) ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ meme :p, 
  poles are not the problem that pro-kremlin cunt - waldemar tomaszewski must be taken down in the head and we can live happily together . 
   as for having things `` more in common '' , i would argue that poland , czechs , slovaks and hungarians have a lot more in common with germany and austria than they do with russia . 
  that is why i like to refer to the area as central europe . 
  you 're definitely not wrong on this . 
  only ukraine/belarus pretty much have common with russia rest to the west are far more western cultured than easterner . 
  did n't belgium had over-sea territories ( most known belgian congo ) ? 
  [ poland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j0ya8tq.jpg ) and [ lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_grunwald#/media/file:matejko_battle_of_grunwald.jpg ) was da sh\u0117t back then !, 
  even though this is how lithuanians [ remember it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dqj78j4.png ) ... :( hope we can become bff again . 
  well both we and ee have their pros and cons atm . 
  actually polish winged hussars are the ones that saved europe from kebab . 
  you meant polish-lithuanian commonwealth ? 
  we are n't slavs , our ( latvian and lithuanian ) language just has similarities with slavs because we had same ancestor before evolving into what 's known baltic language branch . 
  iirc we 're genetically more closer to scandinavian and fins ( + estonians ) than slavs . 
  latvia and estonia has like 20 ~ , lithuania has bigger polish minority than russian one which both makes up like 6 ~ % . 
  besides i 'm pretty sure those russians in baltics would rather live their life in baltics than russia . 
  maybe soon , at least we got observer status , which makes us thankful . 
  kk beauty . 
  seems pretty odd . 
  what 's wrong about our beautiful language ? 
  nobody wants to speak sexy baguette language , foreigners might think you 're sexual predator . 
  want to do french kiss . 
  ca n't make it happens because of monitor , help little ~ ~ france ~ ~ dutch ^ ^ ^ im ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  well this is not interbellum period , we have no territorial claims between each other any more so i 'm pretty sure as long as we cooperate as equals in `` our '' alliance against western european and russia hegemony over us , we might get this going just quite well . 
  long , long , long time ago , arabia was very scientifically ahead . 
  polish sound even worse ... 
  since our language does n't really have any curse words , we use foreign ones . 
  like russian , polish or british !, 
  you got pretty damn sexy curse words . 
  [ intermarium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) still alive . 
  i actually think the same . 
  we need to become bff again < 3, 
  now even chechen 's are trying to cross borders illegally as economic immigrants ? 
  what 's next , russia 's `` refugee 's '' trying to get into europe ? 
  aka ex-communist countries ... 
  finland can into baltic !, 
  welcome home bro !, 
  almost every map place us in northern europe , except cia . 
  the only place in europe where russia has influence is belarus though it keeps staying neutral as possible and that 's all , ukrainians already have seen pan-slavic friendliness of russia . 
  any way , russia does n't deserve and will never hold sphere of influence as much as putin can bitch about it . 
   not exactly but yes . 
  now imagine nato troops and missiles positioned in sweden ? 
  there is already nuclear weapons in turkey , germany and some few other european countries , how would sweden make any difference ? 
   it 's relatively close to their borders so they have to respect them . 
  like russia ever respected it 's neighbour borders . 
  there is no such a thing as russia 's sphere of influence , they can fuck off with that . 
  nato is not expending , nations willingly asks for permission to join it . 
  and how exactly is nato fucking with russia ? 
  please give me one example . 
  because being communist in past is still relevant till this day / s, 
  i find it funny , i love germany too ... :\\ ^ ), 
  i did n't say he was the reason why i stopped learning it , i just did n't felt any motivation or any reason to keep learning it . 
  nothing really personal or against it , it 's a beautiful language , it was the reason why i started to learn it in first place . 
  he always remind me why i stopped learning french . 
  just steal a russian minority and you will see russia next door . 
  give us all your polish girls we give you all lithuanian boys and can have little \u017de\u010dpospolita children * minority in poland ;p, 
  as much as i respect you and your country , putin would n't give two shits about it . 
   which european countries does / r/europe want to live in which part you did n't understand ? 
  if you tried to make a joke , you failed quite well , bro . 
  you did n't get the joke . 
  you 're true german now . 
  what ethnic russians ? 
  stop eating rt you f * ck . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_%28lithuania%29 it 's good time to stop eating rt shit . 
  nato is best thing that happened for us if you ever think baltics will want to leave nato it will never happen . 
  i do n't understand how are we slaves to them ? 
  answer me to this . 
  you can come here when ever you want big boy , 
  rule polanndia , rule the waves !, 
  well we have our differences . 
  while lithuania and latvia comes from same baltic language ( indo-european ) branch , estonian 's are speaking finnic just like finland who are not part of ie ; but because of past history while latvia and estonia were under livonia ( germans were elite ) and then sweden , lithuania was independent and was very close ally with poland ( personal union and then real union occurred ) which made us hardcore catholics while estonia and latvia became lutherans . 
  the only moment we were similar was because we were annexed into russian empire and after ww2 into su . 
  you forgot we were imperialistic on potatoes ^ ^ ^ ^ ( belarus ) too, 
  but ... but ... what about us ? 
  word `` suomi '' is baltic orgin though . 
  it made me think more about store named `` iki '' xd, 
  plus depression . 
  i always found those who have those cheek bones attractive ... 
  yeah true , but they 're very similar though . 
  lithuanian would be `` b\u0117glys '' . 
  always makes me get into geography more . 
  we can feel you . 
  i would n't say that sovereignty was ceded , rather our culture and language so our nobles would get those sweet privileges as polish nobles had . 
  well we , lithuania 's can clearly relate to this in past . 
  plus thanks for the info . 
  edit : i think these are more populist methods to get themselves more popular ( heh ) . 
  nope . 
  i know you try to make comparison but this is n't a case . 
  well i did n't understand that you wanted to call it karaliau\u010dius but rather k\u00f6nigsberg in german . 
  he was n't wrong . 
  sometimes western countries referred to it just poland , kingdom of poland or polish commonwealth but only in later years of commonwealth , plus [ constitution of may 3 , 1791 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_may_3,_1791 ) pretty much made sure both regions were finally united under one country before getting completely erased from the map in 1795 .
