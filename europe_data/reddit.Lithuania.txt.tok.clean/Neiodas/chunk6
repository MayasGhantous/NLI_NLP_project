  true . 
  though lithuanians before p-l c. had chance to burn down moscow , sadly we did n't . 
  well poland at that time was n't made up just from poland . 
  the biggest problem was our geographical location . 
  but i agree , about putting a fight for attention from west . 
  well i do n't know , but guerrilla warfare helped us a bit . 
  at least we put good 9 years of fight in guerrilla warfare against them , maybe this is a reason why we did n't end up with big russian minority , like estonia and latvia do . 
  poles were n't the only ones to reach moscow , you know . 
  why ? 
  happy national day !, 
  best friend of our former best friend !, 
   why does europe must protect the falklands ? 
  why would russian want to defend kaliningrad ? 
  because it belongs to it . 
   are n't they argentinian ? 
   with the majority of inhabitants descended from scottish and welsh immigrants who settled the territory in 1833, 
  you americans are weird when it comes on motivations to do something . 
  latvia , we did n't eat your potato , stop trying to kill us . 
  all your base are belong to us !, 
  or prepare on getting tickle ... to death !,

  ** usa ** is best !, 
  showing gratitude to iceland for being first country in the world to recognize lithuania as independent country .

  true story . 
  iceland is always best bro , you will always be ** [ remembered ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljpdgwx2i30 ) ** in our hearts !,

  so as mine . 
  so their economy grows and stop taking their jobs !, 
  but latvija , you of zirga galva !, 
   lithuania - nice wilno , almost poland ... and ofc homeland for all poles . 
  i think you 're shitting salt at the moment . 
   i know the ** baltics ** get their name from the baltic sea and not the other way around , although i do n't remember what it means . 
  the term `` baltic '' stems from the name of the baltic sea -- a hydronym dating back to the 11th century ( adam of bremen mentioned latin : mare balticum ) and earlier . 
  it likely originates from the indo-european root * bhel meaning white , fair . 
  this meaning is retained in modern baltic languages , where baltas ( in lithuanian ) and balts ( in latvian ) means `` white '' . 
  however the modern names of the region and the sea , that originate from this root , were not used in either of the two languages prior to 19th century . 
  we [ kicked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ) your ass :p, 
  get out of here . 
  you drink wrong beer then . 
  relax , brother , he 's our brother . 
  we 're not weird , that 's just polish influence in past !, 
  yeah , i call bs . 
  well personally , i would n't mind canada being in eurovision , but name of `` eurovision '' would need to change . 
  well next time make research before asking . 
  it 's not that hard . 
  friend .

   australia participated in the eurovision song contest 2015 in vienna , austria . 
  owing to its cultural and political ties to european countries , ** the eurovision song contest has been televised in australia by the public broadcaster sbs for over thirty years . 
  in honour of the contest 's 60th running and in recognition of the event 's popularity in australia ** , it was announced on 10 february 2015 that australia was to be invited to compete in the 2015 contest as a special guest participant .

  that 's a wet dream and at the moment pretty impossible . 
   i always loved baltics we love you too !, 
  euro bro getting on it 's feet , hooray !,

  this should n't be a surprise .

  i guess you wo n't mind after 3 months answering why he said [ octopus ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalmarai ) .

  lithuania is predicted to lose 30.1 % of its population we need to start f * cking , who volunteers ?

  all hail vytis !, 
  well we did borrowed it from denmarks island ... so ... 
  i mean how we could have ended up with not cool flag while having cool history . 
  do n't worry , we think the same . 
  should really kept our wonderful `` vytis '' . 
  should have kept our glorious `` vytis '' ;p . 
  well yes i do agree on this . 
  half an hour ago i saw in news how these so called arabs were causing nothing but violence in one of islands of greece . 
  one of them spoke `` i want to to get into europe , why do n't you let me in ? 
  i just want to get into europe '' . 
  while police trying to stop illegal imigrants from causing more trouble . 
  my father himself said `` go back , europe does n't need you '' . 
  as much as it sounds racist or xenophobic , he 's at the moment right . 
  you think destroying property and causing violent riot needs a context in modern european nation ?
