  thank god this `` anti-infidels '' are non-existing in my country . 
  but lithuania and poland did it from west , succesfully ;p, 
   the yellow in the flag is meant to symbolize the sun and prosperity , the green is for countryside , liberty and hope , and the red represents the bravery and blood of those who have died for lithuania . 
  same about benelux , smaller countries which live in flat soil can not stand as neutral countries , it 's impossible when you have always imperialistic neighbor . 
  because both became very nationalistic . 
  those were n't knights , those were winged hussars !, 
  glorious cavalry at the time !, 
   according to mikhail gorbachev , the united states is returning to its `` old policy of pressure '' because it needs an enemy . 
  for some reason i think this is more common for russia today than usa . 
   the us `` lost its way '' by creating a `` super-empire '' aha and ussr was n't a super-empire ? 
   poland is pretty much always a `` good '' character ( i do n't recall ever seeing an `` evil poland '' comic ) [ ehem ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dqj78j4.png ), 
  we have some differences if you look between south or north , east or west . 
  what we have common is for sure a big chunk of shared history . 
  some countries share culture and speak same language which makes them to be closer to each other . 
  i do n't think strong european indentity exists , but we can achieve it . 
  but ... but we make jokes about ruskies and show only love to great usa !, 
  seems logical after being most waring continent . 
  it was super easy at beginning but it looked more and more hell at the moment i just said `` f * ck it im done '' . 
  nothing personal . 
  i 'm up for this . 
  poland is the only ally that we can surely rely on . 
  why it should suck to be us ? 
  because we could understand what ruskies speak ? 
  besides that 's soviet legacy , give it half a century and it will be low as anywhere else . 
  well yes you do , since they 're in nato . 
  same . 
  though it was like 40/50 in my school because 10 took french . 
  but i took french . 
  and i regret it . 
  that ai n't fair , we speak lithuanian or english . 
  poor little guy . 
  at least he 's resting in peace now . 
  hue, 
  yeah , i see now . 
  were is difference between eurozone and eu . 
  you do know the same army who beat nazi germany was the one who finished off most of jewish prisoners and raped what got in their way till berlin ? 
  ww2 should not be celebrated , it should be remembered as times of terror and darkness from both nazism and soviets . 
  besides nkvd not being part of military organization does n't make them good guys . 
  we should make a union to eradicated this . 
  ca n't trolls like you have something better to do ? 
  that 's the thing we do need to catch up , but simply saying we will always be behind and poor is just plain stupid . 
  but you ai n't our braliukas o.o, 
  your trolling ai n't good mate , you can go to sleep now . 
  because we do n't have big russian minority . 
  but march or any other thing that is meant to glorify glorious soviets is cool for russians and perfecly acceptable ? 
  i mean yeah that seems stupid to make a march to glorify nazim , but russians should keep it to its own throat . 
  could you explain more ? 
  i did n't get it . 
  wtf, 
  no one said we want to be at germany 's lvl ... you choose the strongest in europe economy as example that we will never reach western level ... 
  if you want to compare take something smaller like denmark , sweden , benelux countries or for that matter finland is prime example etc. 
   balts will never reach the level of prosperity western and northern europe enjoys today , unless these regions go through some sort of cataclysm , while baltics go unscathed . 
  we will and it 's only matter of time . 
  we 're one of if not biggest european countries that have fastest growth of economy simply saying that we will never reach western is just stupid . 
  excuse me , again ? 
  we do not shout that we 're nordic and we 're definetly not a `` typical shit hole '' . 
  i think you forgot pills for keeping your mental health , friend . 
  not going to keep conversation with you anymore since it 's obivious who `` you 're '' . 
  good bye . 
  thank god we 're on better side today . 
   the years before nazi intervention in soviet union and the years after the victory in europe are thrown out the history of war . 
  so annexation of poland and the baltic states , intervention to finland and soviet-japanese war of 1945 counts as the completely separated conflicts . 
   soviet soldiers seen to be impeccable heroes . 
  any historical evidences about any looting , rape and so on declared to be part of western propaganda . 
  that 's quite sad . 
  lithuania : i 'm quite ashamed that we [ gave up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940_soviet_ultimatum_to_lithuania ) so easily to soviets in hopes we would n't get occupied and keep our independence . 
  soviet terror was really terrible at ~ 1 year of occupation , deportation and massive collectivisation at the point that we greeted nazi germany and their army with flowers . 
  from what i know werchmant was actually a good folks here only those actual nazis that came under control of occupied territory were hated . 
  as much as we can play a victim in ww2 both nazis and soviets gave something `` good '' ( i do n't really want to look like a bad person so please go easy on me ) nazis killing off jews and slavs ( which meant less ethnic conflict in future ) and soviets giving us back klaip\u0117da / memelland ( from germany ) and vilnius/wilno ( from poland ) even though it was like selling soul to the devil . 
  what is most important is that our [ partisans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_partisans ) fought both nazis and soviets . 
  soviet did n't care if you fought against nazi regime , if you 're smart or the one that actually can fight for freedom you 're `` enemy of the state , collaborator with enemy '' etc it 's heart breaking then our lithuanian partisans manage to hold off till 1953 . 
  all baltic states were doing as good as western european countries , same for rest of the bloc . 
  soviets took 50 years from us , they tried to void our culture , language and nationality . 
  terrible times . 
  excuse me ? 
  nobody denying anything here . 
  poland always shout that they 're central european , not us . 
   polish-lithuanian-ruthenian commonwealth ftfy , 
  what about lithuania ? 
  ;( you did n't even mention us . 
  one of comments from `` mapporn '' though i do n't know myself if it 's a loanword . 
  i think it 's not for baltics , but is for finns . 
   as for ale / \u00f8l , they come from ** proto-germanic alu ( `` ale '' ) ** , which came from an ** proto-indo-european ** root that might have meant `` bitter '' . 
  today at least in lithuania only old people are the ones that can actually speak russian . 
  english is far more common here . 
   western ukrainians decided to otherthrow the democratically elected government ... because the so called `` democratically elected government '' lied to it 's own people being heavily corrupted , they promised closer ties to west and taking a big step towards european union and then * boom * they said `` nope that ai n't happening '' that 's the main reason why maiden started . 
   and the eastern ukrainians rebelled . 
  it 's a civil war . 
  because it has russians in it who wants to stick with their so called `` mother russia '' . 
   i agree that russia is involved but so is nato . 
  in fact i 'd argue that the civil war would not have happened at all without nato and the usa encouraging it . 
  i would n't say that nato took part on it , maybe usa , but definetly not nato . 
  besides both nato and usa are not the ones that give tanks , anti-air misseles etc while russia arms rebels to the point there massive civilian casualties happening because they hide under civilians . 
   nato 's purpose is over . 
  the ussr is dead and gone , russia is not a communist state and has no ideology it wishes to see implemented . 
  ukraine would like to have a word with you . 
  the moment first american soldier dies in latvia they would shout for war . 
  that 's a past , the only people who do n't like poles are from rural areas that never met one . 
  you traitor ;(, 
   believing in god obliges you to obey certain rules .
