  i like it . 
  tugboats are so cute sped up !, 
  i know it 's not cool , it 's plasma after all . 
   technology demonstration of miniature fabry-perot spectral imager , small radiation monitor and satellite ** deorbiting with plasma brake ** . 
  yeah , that one is n't cool enough to be at the front of the description ;d, 
  hmm you 're right , there 's nothing but conscription and propaganda broadcasts going on around in the eu at the moment . 
  war between that hell hole brussels and dictator merkel is about to break out any minute , i 'm just here wondering which side lithuania will pick : / ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  will the danish propaganda never stop ? 
  russian ex-clay you say ? 
  * casus belli gained : reconquest *, 
  i think if brexit had n't happened , ukip would 've continued to do whatever they were doing to keep their base happy and it just would 've continued the same way they 've been going , with eu being the devil but not doing anything constructive about it . 
  even farrage is out of power now and seems europe is at least waking up a little bit . 
  maybe not in some areas , but defence is one way to start i suppose . 
  `` you want a favourable deal for yourself after blaming every little even remotely negative aspect of your society on the eu ? 
  pass . '', 
  i do n't see a sorry anywhere , you 're a fake !, 
  surely , simply hire the boring company and let them practise tunneling , they 'll even do it for free if it 's for freedom to anschluss !, 
  just dig a tunnel under them , you can also use it for storing food in the winter !, 
  and besides , it 's not like there 's no countries with big exclaves !, 
  a referendum could be had to decide which part is the exclave , since referendums have a great track record recently . 
  lithuania 's looks like a modified soviet european union flag . 
  * shudder *, 
  just anschluss each other and be done with it . 
  easiest way . 
  they 're literally just letting her touch and look at the gun . 
  they 're not training her . 
  it 's in the middle of vilnius , our capital . 
  not ideal for weapons training . 
  i can do 2.2 at max . 
  this map is a lie !, 
  do n't tell me what to do , you nazis !, 
  netherlands less european than lithuania and eesti , the wet dream ... 
  it 's ok , someone 's bound to not get it . 
  georgia the country or georgia the state ? 
  no one talks about the millions of worm casualties . 
  despicable !, 
  denmark will fly away soon at this rate !, 
  finno-ugric language serves as aphrodisiac confirmed . 
  that 's simply smart . 
  i love it . 
  i was there a couple years ago on the top and did n't see it !, 
  stealthicular !, 
  called after the guy that bought it . 
  king or prince got the power to overturn a result of a referendum through the public vote . 
  he holds a garden party for everyone in the country . 
  once some swiss troops wandered in over the border unknowingly , then had to scold themselves for accidentally invading , as switzerland is also responsible for liechtenstein 's defence . 
  i hope at least some of that 's right , i heard it all on a podcast :p, 
  huh ? 
  he is very smart and works with cool things , but he does appear to be a bit too full of himself . 
  i watched some of his videos and he 's got good points against solar roadways and small projects like that , but he also dismisses ( i 'm just guessing ) hundreds of engineers at this point . 
  i would n't assume he 's right 100 % on some subjects . 
   they were never great , they have been great just a really little period of time . 
  yeah , i know what you mean !, 
  alright , fair enough !, 
  i did n't look at the source , thanks for clearing it up . 
  i hope you do n't , friend \\ \u00a9 /, 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ fucking ^ ^ ^ sad ^ ^ ^ every ^ ^ ^ time ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ posted ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  most of them are jobless drunks , though . 
  so kinda works still ... 
  yeah we are hostile against the big looming bear . 
  would be very naive to not be . 
  though the graphic says `` russians were hostile towards '' . 
  well to be fair they did attack a couple places , so mr putin is not contradicting himself . 
  `` russia does n't care about the baltic states , they just want russia to care . '', 
  my operator sent me a message i have roaming off from june 1st !, 
  no u, 
  has n't it been dry for the last ... 
  however long it 's been around ? 
  a lot better than treason , then . 
  you know , when there 's a bear lurking in the woods , ocassionally throwing rocks in your airspace and crossing a border or two all by accident , after a long history of getting oppressed , i think one might be excused for not being kind and very tolerant that massive fucking bear breathing down your neck from 2 sides . 
  it 's nose is literally that big . 
  gets in everyone 's business . 
  also if france or slovenia ever made a hostile environment for lgbt people , i 'm sure russia would offer up asylum to show off what a great place it is . 
  i was n't a piece of shit so none . 
  also i was n't stupid enough to believe it . 
  my little brother was n't being scared with any , either . 
  i do n't understand how scaring your kids with some monster would help them behave and develop in the long run . 
  seems to me they 'd just eventually find out it was a lie and their parents could n't do anything to stop them , so they 'd act out whatever they want with no regard to everyone else . 
  or at least more chances for that to happen . 
  no one wants to pay , still pay them . 
  a country needs taxes to help its people , that 's no way around it . 
  yes . 
  1 usd roughly 0.9 eur ; 1 cad roughly 0.7-0 .8 usd i 'd guess , i 've never needed to look it up for precision ; no idea what peso exchange rates are , i have never needed to look it up . 
  my non english speaking hard labour working dad knows usa has usd , it 's not an amazing thing to know that little . 
  not popular since there 's not many ice rinks , plus basketball dominates like 85 % of sport coverage . 
  i have seen some news about a good i 've hockey player once or twice as well as national hockey team food this or that . 
  i do n't know anyone who 's into it . 
  most people here say `` j\u0117zau '' / `` jesus !, 
  yeah i think it 's up to 15 cents for the biggest ones . 
  there are `` ads '' in the stores to use a recyclable paper bag or buy a cloth bag instead , though . 
  every day i 'm walking further than 500 meters somewhere , in that time there 's gon na be at least one police car somewhere in view . 
  in the second biggest city in lithuania . 
  1547 , katekizmas by martynas ma\u017evydas - first book printed in lithuanian so we stayed on it for a couple lessons every other year or so . 
  cheese is n't a lithuanian invention , but american spray tan , i mean spray cheese . 
  what the fuck . 
  i do n't mind if someone points out a problem , it 's good for the future . 
  only using monies phones so they have never been down , internet has been bitchy for 3 months randomly disconnecting and packet loss spiking but now it 's fine . 
  last time internet went down was maybe 3 weeks ago when the isp said `` there 's a big problem in our servers '' for 3 days straight .
