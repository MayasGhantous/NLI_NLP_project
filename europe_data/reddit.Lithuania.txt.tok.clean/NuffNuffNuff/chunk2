  he said men . 
   because they are mostly self-responsible for that . 
  how does that make it into a not-warrying trend ? 
  alcoholism and suicide in my country is also a self-responsible thing , but you know , it 's still worrying, 
  i feel like you watched too much house m.d. 
   you see , that 's some real bullshit there and it annoys me . 
  you simply just ca n't make such a general statement without providing any kind of proof you 're doing the exact same thing . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's not a university degree in lithuania either . 
  i think it might be a thing we tell ourselves to makes us feel better, 
  they 're still riding . 
  mayyybe a bit newer version https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_h-dxdc_gmk/maxresdefault.jpg, 
  yeah , it 's some fancy hipstery version also it 's saltibarsciai wtf stop stealing nash kultura, 
  or , you know , people interpret stuff different ways and there is no one set in stone path for a conversation , but whatever suits you, 
  which is exactly the thing i 'm explaining to you in my comments to you . 
  i 'm literally showing you how arrived at what i said . 
   you were the only one that completely misunderstood what the reference was pointing towards . 
   do you not get that ? 
  is that really that hard ? 
  enlighten me instead of being a smartass then, 
  and what 's your point ? 
  you know conversations evolve , the one i linked to clearly focuses on marxism only and conversation goes from there . 
   i have more context to that post in my link , which was the point of me linking it . 
  it actually shows the rest of the comment chain . 
  no it does n't on mobile, 
  you literally linked to the same post . 
   you did n't , but your first response responds to a comment chain about him financing marxist organisations . 
  my first post responds to comment chain that started with this [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mt524/israel_backs_hungary_says_financier_soros_is_a/dk44ie9/ ) here it is if you do n't want to click the link :  oh , lol , the ` cultural marxism ' meme , spicy . 
  you can clearly see that the focus here was marxism and not soros funding . 
  the author of that post took issue with `` cultural marxims '' , probably because it 's a conspiracy theory . 
  [ this dude ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mt524/israel_backs_hungary_says_financier_soros_is_a/dk451xm/ ) probably did not understand that it 's a reference to a conspiracy theory and thought `` holly shit , he does n't believe marxists exist ? 
  they 're literally waving flags in the streets !!! '' . 
  in comes [ this guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mt524/israel_backs_hungary_says_financier_soros_is_a/dk48goj/ ) with what looks like doubt that there are people self identifying as marxists and waving flags . 
  so i think to myself `` wtf , has he been living under a rock ? 
  they are on the news all the time '' . 
  well , at least i have the decency to not downvote you, 
  to a comment that doubts marxist waving flags in the streets, 
  given your post history , i 'm not just gon na take your word for it . 
  does it really make about as much sense ? 
  black american is an easily identifiable trait ( iirc americans even have race in their ids ? ), 
  while liberal means whatever people want it to mean . 
  for example you might notice that for some americans liberal and communist are basically sinonyms . 
  for others it means socially progressive . 
  in europe it 's even another , what people call `` original '' meaning . 
  so i ca n't see how that is a valid argument, 
  not in a single fucking comment did i say he 's doing it, 
  what i 'm saying is that `` x is * insert loosely defined ideology * therefore he ca n't fund * insert loosely defined movement * '' is not a sound argument . 
  ok , i think when people say `` cultural marxism '' they mean a few different things : - cultural marxism conspiracy theory ( hence the previous comment in this thread about it being a meme ) - critical theory/intersectionality - plain old marxism seriously , look at this thread , someone started of with a general [ marxist ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mt524/israel_backs_hungary_says_financier_soros_is_a/dk4407h/ ) , then a different person assumed he 's talking about [ cultural marxism ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mt524/israel_backs_hungary_says_financier_soros_is_a/dk44ie9/ ) in reference to conspiracy theory , then another one jumped in talking about [ communists ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mt524/israel_backs_hungary_says_financier_soros_is_a/dk451xm/ ) and then i put in my three cents assuming they meant intersectionality . 
  so i do n't think there is any discrepency in the idea of american style liberal funding intersectionalists and i feel like modern antifa movement is more intersectionalist than it is communist . 
  i do n't know about soros funding in particular because i literally googled him for the first time now . 
  does your label of `` liberal '' somehow precludes him from funding marxist organisations ? 
  you know that when us papers call him liberal , they mean it in the american sense , not european ? 
  i 'm saying they 're waving communists flags which some people here seem to doubt, 
  i 'm not saying they 're getting payed by soros , i thought you meant prove `` there are marxist organisations waving communist flags '', 
  the ammount of non european immigrants is so low in the baltics , that we barely see not white people on the daily basis . 
  and since there are almost none of them , the ones that are here do n't form large closed off communities and usually interact a lot with the locals and we do n't have any problems . 
  the moment they would start forming immigrant communities a la sweden , france , etc , we would start having big problems . 
  all the antifa vs trump supporters shit going on the last few months does n't ring a bell ? 
  well at least ours looks like it can be used by several people at once . 
  probably because implementing socialist economies on a large scale is literally impossible, 
  stop being hyperbolic , a months wage was at least $ 40, 
   it was mostly organized criminals taking each other out ehh , at least in lithuania we had a real big problem with kidnappings and torture of businessmen . 
  although businessmen during those times were pretty shady, 
   while our murder rate is pretty abysmal compared to most of europe , is it really ? 
  most of western europe is arround 2 while yours is arround 4-5 and very concentrated to some particular cities iirc . 
  while there are a ton of countries with the rate in double digits . 
  what really amazes me is how well our countries dealt with it in the end, 
  he 's not saying it 's not worse , he 's just explaining it more in depth, 
  are n't you like already rich af ? 
  and it just proves it 's better to have a society where the norm is speaking up when you see injustice rather than one where everybody is minding what they say , lest they be fined or arrested . 
  in one sentence you say free speach is shitty , in another you warn about dangers of fascism . 
  make up your mind, 
  who would even know about the jew killings if the gobitler is in control of the apparatus that decides what you can know/hear and what you ca n't ? 
  it would be way harder if society was n't so keen on such laws, 
  when next gobbels and hitler comes into power they 'll make full use of those laws, 
  [ i highlighted areas that are not part of the arch structure + do not have downwards pressure acting on them . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/znamv2c.jpg ) the top one even has very clearly visible binding agent . 
  so how do the top ones without any pressure stay in place ? 
  `` without any kind of mortar or cement '' is a bit misleading is n't it , makes it sound like the bricks are held up with prayers, 
  yes , it was schroder . 
  it was a condition of us joining the eu , a condition pushed by shroder and german government at large, 
  thanks man i love you too, 
  he specifically mentioned price and not production costs . 
  otherwise , yeah . 
  also to add , huge markets like germany are more efficient for distribution and marketing . 
  roughly speaking you only need one department for a country , and if that country has more people , that department is cheaper to maintain, 
  it is cheaper when taking into account purchasing power . 
  so relatively cheaper , nominaly not cheaper, 
  well it 's the lefts favorite boogeyman , so whatever fits his current agenda, 
  and the most badass, 
  we could have already done it with nuclear , but nooo , germany does n't like that , they 're much more happy with russian gas, 
  lithuanians call it that too, 
  psa : if the pill does n't easily crumble , is glazed and looks high quality ( nice edges , sharp imprint ) - it 's probably one of those potent ones, 
   i want to say you are n't missing much , you would have been a filthy liar if you said that, 
  yeah , people are talking like it 's a bad thing that they 're strong . 
  just take half ffs, 
  at # 126 it is just 5 homicides higher than # 1 andora/san marino/liechtenstein/monaco which are glorified towns full of rich old people . 
  and it is 103 homicides lower than the last place el salvador . 
  you make pretty good points elsewhere in this thread . 
  this is not one of them . 
  you mean the empire that collapsed exactly because it could n't handle and assimilate the huge number of migrants ?
