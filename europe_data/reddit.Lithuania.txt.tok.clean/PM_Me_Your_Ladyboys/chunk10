  the right usage of classificiation should be centum and satem languages , so this abomination of balto-slavic would be gone . 
  most of turkey back then were hellenic ( greekish ) people . 
  russia did n't even exist back , not even it 's parent state . 
   latvian as a distinct language emerged during several centuries by language spoken by ancient latgalian tribe assimilating the languages of other neighboring baltic tribes - curonian , semigallian and selonian , which resulted in these languages gradually losing their most distinct characteristics . 
  this process of consolidation started in the 13th century after the livonian crusade and forced christianization . 
  these tribes came under livonian rule thus forming a unified political , economic and religious space . 
  not so much , poor old prussians . 
  it 's all your fault !!!, 
  all three actually existed , except russia , whose center was still forested swamp , which was still just part of kievan rus ' territory . 
  [ battle of grunwald ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/jan_matejko%2c_bitwa_pod_grunwaldem.jpg/1920px-jan_matejko%2c_bitwa_pod_grunwaldem.jpg ) , best day of my life . 
   what you meant to say is that estonia was not a unified state back then . 
  did n't duchy of estonia exist in the northern parts ? 
  was n't poland back then about to become vassal or even obsorbed by hre ? 
  iirc that 's why you also needed a strong ally e.g. 
   primitive small kingdoms ? 
  yes . 
  except they were not russian , but ruthenian . 
  ukrainians , belarusians , russians and rusyns were one and same ethnic group back then - east slavs ( known as ruthenians ) , who spoke same language . 
  the reason why russia is named , well , `` russia '' is because it wanted to justify it 's imperilistic ambitions on retaking all ex-kievan rus ' territories , especially ones controlled by g. d. of lithuania , so ruler of g. p. of muscovy named himself tsar of all rus ' , and renamed his country tsardom of russia . 
   could become autonomous part read what i said , it does n't matter who lives there , we just fulfill our ethographic regions . 
  i assume we 're very good and huge economic partner for them . 
  it could become autonomous part of poland or lithuania , in fact with kalinigrad in lithuania we would practically fullfill our [ ethographic region ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/etnoregionai.png ) territories . 
  [ swedo-lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k%c4%97dainiai ) you mean ? 
  yes , yes , do n't lie lenkija , you want to tap that baltic six pack again . 
  thanks . 
  third reich within fourth reich . 
  mind blown . 
   so you will be under german influence for that you will have to invade and annex memelland :( to make us economically depended on you and then force us to attack poland from the north . 
  maybe their families would get exception , i do n't care actually so stop asking me , use google for once . 
  would make sense , if we happen to become kingdom again , we would be third reich . 
  hue [ first reich . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_lithuania ) [ second reich . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_lithuania_ ( 1918 \\ ) #background ) all we need now is third reich . 
  after polish anschluss of lithuania , yes . 
  i really wish we were n't this bigot . 
  and i thought i 'm crazy . 
  both words are correct , but since this is about lithuanian costumes use glorious * leprekonas * . 
  you 're doing your job , you do n't need to bring your family . 
  yet you comment , which says you care . 
  where do you see russophobic context in sainyg that `` su existance was tragedy to the world ? 
  '' , i rather wanted to see russian republic without all the ultra nationalists , than su and the commie pleague they brought . 
   hitler wanted to replicate that by exterminating the slavs , lithuanians , jews etc. 
  except not , nazi plans in berlin were very different from nazi plans in baltic region , oh i wonder why [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cxnov2c.png ) ; [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/akxbikz.png ) . 
  there was 80 % on paper , but it was never used in practice and local generalkommissars . 
  tourists = / = nato soldiers . 
  unless you 're russian . 
  literally just rename the ru fed . 
  to ussr and you will make nostalgic russians happy . 
  su existance was greatest tragedy to the world, 
  yep . 
  thank god you 're finally on our side . 
  did you even read what he said ? 
  nobody says to restore it , you can create ussr out of federal subjects of russian federation . 
  this made me laugh hard . 
  communism , not even once . 
   or , do they blame the collapse on capitalism ? 
  cause it was definitely inevitable first problem was nations not wanting to be part of it , gorbachev had to waste his time on trying to keep us within ussr , instead of just letting go . 
  just like / u/from3to20symbols said , ussr should just let anyone leave , whoever stays wthin ussr will see reform . 
  same here . 
  guess rolling people with tanks was n't enough of reason to complete shut any ties . 
  british tourists are like international call for trouble . 
  once they were in vilnius , all hell broke loose . 
   ural mountains ends in the south and leave no border between european and asian parts of the eurasian steppe . 
  both gibraltar and bosporus can not be considered a real border . 
  mediterranean sea was a transport artery rather than border since the antiquity . 
  which still makes it a phyiscal border between europe and other regions . 
   tatars `` originate '' from the place there they currently live . 
  did they ? 
  too bad they 're getting destroyed by russification . 
   i know for you it 's hard to omit your stereotypes and hear logical arguments , that 's why you resort in shit like `` i know for russians '' and `` if it was shitty nobody would be using that '' . 
  there is no such thing as soviet people , what this demonym represent for you ? 
  russians ? 
  because most of the world think that ussr was just russia . 
  and it was infact russian empire under other layer of name . 
   then what 's exactly defines your european being ? 
  whiteness , christianity , or culture ? 
  if first , than brownish people in south italy are not europeans , if second , than atheists are not european , if third , than finns are not european . 
  or maybe you just admit that `` european people '' is an artificial construct with no real meaning ? 
  south italians are caucasians , who live in europe and embrace european culture , they are , european . 
  it has nothing to do with believing in god , it 's about culture and what do you mean by saying finns are not european ? 
  they 're both genetically , and culturally european . 
  yeah , yeah , europe does n't exist , but soviet people do . 
  please go back to your commie loving state driven by corrupation , hiv and krokodil . 
  you can love your soviet past as much as you want , we hate every single bit of it so do n't say that i should consider soviet people true , there was no soviet people , only master and slave on his knees that was forced to kept his mouth shut . 
  it 's also popular destination for lithuanians , especially gran canaria . 
  sadly through all this time i only got one . 
  :( feelsbadman when it comes to finding similar minded people . 
   no , there 's no such border . 
  yes there are , ural mountains , caucasus , mediterranean sea , straits of gibraltar , strait of bosphorus are natural physical bounderies of europe . 
   i 'm sure you 're educated enough to know that there are `` asian '' people living in geographical europe , for example tatars and other turkic people , and there `` european '' people living outside of europe . 
  which defines their ethnicity and from where they originated from . 
  korean will never be `` european '' he 's east asian living in europe . 
   so saying `` i 'm european '' means nothing i know for russian it is hard to understand such thing as `` european '' but for rest of europe it is not , i 'm european , white , christian , with my own culture that is unique but compare to other parts of world is closest to other european cultures . 
   it says nothing about your ethnicity and culture . 
  yes it does . 
  if i happen to go to mexico and say i 'm european , they will instantly think about the continent of europe . 
  yeah , except nazi germany was lesser evil in the baltics compare to soviet union . 
  not surprised . 
   no , soviet was introduced to note `` we 're all soviets , who live on soviet union '' . 
  and us being occupied also makes us soviet ?
