  better dead than red . 
   that a shitty tradition to divide people by abstract constructs such as `` european continent '' . 
  or do you think there 's a kind of border between europe and asia ? 
  shitty abstract contruct , if it was shitty nobody would be using that , there is a reason it is used . 
  i 'm not asian , not brown skinned or anything , i 'm european , that defines my ethnicity , my culture and geography from where i come from . 
  there is border in europe and asia , it 's cultural , ethnical and physically geographical one . 
  yeah soviet republics , all those republics were under iron fist , forced to work for `` soviet glory '' , to hell with soviet union , wished it fell apart as nazi germany did . 
   except there 're a lot of people in both russia and ukraine who straggle to chose between these two nationalities . 
  yeah sure . 
   how is `` european '' less artificial than `` soviet '' ? 
  also , soviet people included many non-european people ( i bet you know it too ) . 
  because we 're all europeans , who live on european continent . 
  soviet was introduced to replace word `` russian '' . 
   also , soviet people included many non-european people ( i bet you know it too ) . 
  well , that 's not the point , russians should be praising russian scientist achievements and their contribution . 
  anybody who thinks ussr 's existance was good is an idiot . 
  - . - you do realize it when saying european , not every single bloody european nation has to be included . 
  except ukrainians are not russians and russians are not ukrainians , yes the space race was common effort , we have a true term for it - european , not artificially created `` soviet '' one . 
  then again , russians should be happy about russian achievements during that time . 
  ukrainian achievements are not russian achievements . 
  never again . 
  i do n't and more than happy that it finally fell . 
  they want control and wealth i guess which they could take . 
  yes . 
  i wish canada was our neighbour instead of russia . 
  [ plus seals are for cuddle , not for clubble . 
  he 's not asshole , i do n't know how similiar turkey and greece is in traditions , but lithuania and russia are like two different worlds , yet people put stereotype that we 're similar due to geography . 
  many regional people look a like so what ? 
  no , you 're also number one , since you 're part of european realm . 
  why ? 
  why should i be ashamed of things i love ? 
  what do you want , commie revolution ? 
  we need you greece , for your warm island to holiday in . 
  just a beginning . 
  feels warm . 
  and killed many great intellectuals that could have contributed even more to the world . 
  besides russians should be proud of russian who contributed to science , not a fucking invented term `` soviet '' and ussr 's existance . 
  yeah sure . 
  only europe master race , sorry america , you shall be shadow of european federation !, 
  this is not even close to our european orgies !, 
  pathetic !, 
  same here . 
  guess that finnic blood is running in me . 
  hmm , i 'm * menshevik defensists * , so that means i support russian republic ? 
  interesting . 
  like dutch did n't collaborate with nazis . 
  though , get a grip for real , it feels like you 're losing your mental state , i 'm quite worried about you . 
  what i see from you is xenophobe that tries to paint as dark as possible several nations . 
   but whatever , its clear to see you are a high octane denier that happily sticks its head in the sand when it comes to the neo-nazi issue that your region and country has . 
  i just debunked your retarded view , but you 're still so eager to call my country nazi ? 
  when you gave 0 proof . 
   thats hilariously typical for someone such as you who whines about refugees and immigration in every other thread . 
  a lot of wha wha wha about red crimes and not a single squeak about all the atrocities you people happily participated in . 
  do we hide these things in our history books ? 
  do we deny it ? 
  what is your problem with our countries ? 
  there is literally no nazi sentiment here , it 's like fucking pewdiepie , retarded people like you over reacting way too much in simple things , like march of latvian waffen ss legion , who fought against soviet union , who did n't touch a single fucking jew . 
  you 're just blinded by your ignorance . 
   but jews arent `` real '' lithuanians anyway , right ? 
  they dont count ... 
  yes they were . 
  except the lithuanians jews were supporters of nazi occupation and actually participated in massacres of lithuanian people . 
   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , ** nachman dushanski ** , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
   you really couldnt have shown your true colours in a better way with this rabid apologism and denial . 
  where you do you see denial and apologism ? 
  i just gave you facts why only russians cares about latvian waffen ss , they were aimed again soviet occupation , not killing jews or any other ethnicity . 
  how can you be this stupid . 
  you [ edited ] ( http://prntscr.com/egaqak ) your comment , while trying to hide it , man you 're pathetic . 
  apologist , lol , get a grip you angry mock . 
   http://www.globalresearch.ca/neo-nazi-tendencies-in-the-baltic-states-latvian-ruling-party-to-appeal-against-ban-on-waffen-ss-march/17987 oh boy , how are you uneducated in this matter , and it 's no surprise russians are butthurt about this match , i guess it 's time to educate you . 
   oberf\u00fchrer adolf ax , commander of the 15th division , reported on 27 january 1945 : '' ** they are first and foremost latvians . 
  they want a sustainable latvian nation state . 
  forced to choose between germany and russia , they have chosen germany , because they seek co-operation with western civilization . 
  the rule of the germans seems to them to be the lesser of two evils ** . '', 
  this perspective resulted in part from the soviet occupation between 1940 and 1941 , called `` the year of terror '' ( latvian : baigais gads ) during which ** tens of thousands of latvian families were executed or deported ** to siberia with men separated from the women and children to break down resistance . 
  -  conscripts promised in the name of god to be subservient to the german military and its commander adolf hitler , to be courageous and to be prepared to give up their life *** in the fight against bolshevism *** . 
  -  ** legionnaires hoped to fight off the red army until it was no longer a threat to latvia and then turn against nazi germany ** , as a repeat of the latvian war of independence of 1918-1920 , when latvian forces expelled both bolshevik and german forces . 
  ** legionnaires carried latvian flags under their uniforms as a symbol of that hope ** . 
  this sentiment was also reflected in one of the most popular legion songs which went '' ** we will beat the russians now and we will beat the germans after that ** '' ( with euphemisms for russians and germans ) . 
  ** the allies confirmed this as early as 1943 , when a british investigative mission found latvians stood against both their soviet and german occupiers . 
  ** most important part :  in 1946 , the nuremberg tribunal declared the waffen-ss to be a criminal organization , making an exception of people who had been forcibly conscripted . 
  ** throughout the post-war years , the allies would apply this exception to the soldiers of the latvian legion and the estonian legion ** . 
  the us displaced persons commission in september 1950 declared that :  `` the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission ** holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states ** . '', 
  - -  http://www.irishtimes.com/news/neo-nazis-in-baltics-tolerated-by-eu-jewish-lobby-says-1.971810   moshe kantor , a russian businessman , accused estonia and latvia hhahaha , why i 'm not surprised . 
    the soviet army 's role in freeing eastern europe [ some russians are truly delusional . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_european_anti-communist_insurgencies )   estonia caused an outcry in russia last march by moving a monument to red army soldiers away from the centre of the capital , tallinn . 
  holy shit , estonia is literally nazi lol . 
  - to end this , you brain is in a box . 
  lithuanians never had waffen-ss legion . 
   overall , local self-government was quite developed in lithuania and helped to sabotage or hinder several german initiatives , including raising a waffen-ss unit or providing men for forced labor in germany . 
  wtf, 
  15 years of experience without a proof . 
  that 's exactly what i expected , a total non sense from you . 
  i know that taste , [ yammy kebabs ] ( https://i.imgur.com/6zdhdbp.jpg ) . 
  lol . 
  so you got no proves of this ? 
  expected . 
  so bosphorus is wider than giblartar ? 
  then you can clearly show me examples of that , i 'd like to see that myself . 
  what you named are non aggression treaties which with lithuanian case failed due to them wanting klaip\u0117da / memel region and asking for assistance in occupation of poland ( to attack us from north ) which we refused .
