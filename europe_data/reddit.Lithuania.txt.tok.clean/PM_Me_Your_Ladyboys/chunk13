  under ataturk greeks in the west and armenians in the east were getting killed , displaced etc. 
  there are many of them ... 
  you had a fancy name here before the soviet take over which was gudija , now it 's baltarusija . 
  he 's not wrong though . 
  the only thing that makes this interesting is because it 's close proximity towards european continent and it 's influence on `` gates of asia '' - turkey . 
   first of all , those baltic and finnic originated people have today slavic roots as well . 
  -   i 'm talking about russian baltics and russian finno-ugric . 
  - ... you need to learn to how to write a sentence then . 
  you 're saying as if all lithuanians today have slavic roots while in fact we do n't . 
  * shrugs in lithuanian . 
  happy independence day beautiful bulgaria !, 
  in case of my comment , to expand , ukraine did n't exist , but [ ruthenia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian\u2013ruthenian_commonwealth ) did . 
  proud of pushing for space , not proud of being soviet . 
   first of all , those baltic and finnic originated people have today slavic roots as well . 
  we do n't ...   since the neolithic period the native inhabitants of the lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside , so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements , although without being actually isolated from them . 
  -   lithuanians , like most other baltic/scandinavian cultures , have been known for being people of above average height . 
  at the end of the 19th century , the average height of males was 163.5 cm ( 5 ft 4 in ) and the average height of females was 153.3 cm ( 5 ft 0 in ) . 
  by the end of the 20th century , heights averaged 181.3 cm ( 5 ft 11 in ) for males and 167.5 cm ( 5 ft 6 in ) for females . 
  eurotrip , movie about americans going to europe . 
  showing every retarded stereotype you can think on some european nations . 
  would suggest to watch it if you like comedies . 
  exactly . 
  that 's why russification policy is very useful for russia . 
  let 's talk about baltic fed . 
  like in ~ 1918 , we always put our best leaders when it comes to union state , ask lenkija 's opinion on that . 
  what we failed , european fed . 
  will succeed . 
  we take pennsylvania , lithuanian minority needs some liberation . 
  there was no such thing as ukraine when partitions of plc happened . 
  su was meant to break , it was built on blood . 
  how to fix lithuanian-russian relations ?

   sincerely , go fuck yourself , i have nothing to discuss with a person who 's only objection to exterminate my ethnicitiy is that it sounds harsh ... but is entirely justified because the actions of a government which does n't exist anymore a century ago ... 
  sincerely , go fuck yourself , i have nothing to discuss with a person who 's only objection to exterminate my ethnicitiy since times of kievan rus ' . 
  ask latvians how awesome it was for them to live under ussr , they were literally being replaced by russians . 
  blame soviets , not estonians or latvians . 
   in western lithuania it is samogitian . 
  the language that is considered to be a dialect of standart lithuanian but still is different enough to be called a separate language . 
  because standardized lithuanian is half prussian lithuanian , half auk\u0161taitian , samogitian dialect ( \u017demai\u010di\u0173 tarm\u0117 ) was never included . 
  : dd can you get a grip already ? 
   as i said , more like it 's clear as day he did it because he 's butthurt about lithuania 's lack of relevance . 
  [ lol so mad ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5w9z84/the_lithuanianpolish_commonwealth_was_into_space/de8hqjj/ ), 
  i enjoy it though . 
  : dd as i said , butthurt poles , it 's clear as day he did that on purpose just for a joke . 
  or just butthurt poles nagging about sequence of names . 
  what it has to do with little man then ? 
  i know that we would fallen under soviet rule if it was n't for poland share in soviet-polish war , but then again , i do n't feel obligated to be thankful for them since they were our enemies and might as well burn in hell together with soviets . 
  little man because i do n't embrace polish soldiers who killed my fellow lithuanians ? 
  i do n't think they mind that . 
   so how the scenario would look like in your eyes ? 
  poland is collapsing , latvia and estonia become soviet republics , soviets are approaching germany , where another revolution breaks out ... and what is happening with lithuania ? 
  same as in yours , lithuania falls . 
  but in no way i 'm going to be thankful to those polish soldiers , they 're not the reason why we 're independent . 
   so what 's the other in this case ? 
  polish soldiers are not heros here . 
   you cann ' t be serious saying that russia would respect any peace treaty when their goal was to export communism abroad and regain old borders ? 
  you said you lost the war ? 
  so why did they respect the borders then ? 
   i never insist on you to be thankful . 
  i was just stating geopolitical fact that without defeat of soviet troops in poland the soviet-lithuanian peace treaty would mean nothing . 
  in your eyes , not others . 
   well it is truth . 
  many was n't friendly towards ukrainians ( dmowski for example ) , but pi\u0142sudski was on the other side . 
  he was on other side , but still failed in everything because he was too greedy and too naive to think that nations would fall under polish aegis . 
   yes this is all truth . 
  but you can not admit that lithuania was n't `` angelic state '' . 
  where do you see me saying lithuania was angelic state ? 
  we did wanted to take over non-lithuanian territories , i never denied that , which unlike you who try to justify that it held polish minorities so it must belong to poland ( e.g. 
  ukrainian , belarusian case ) . 
   what 's your point ? 
  the territory belong to german empire , but people inhabiting it were n't always german . 
  it was inhabited with lithuanians and was held by league of nations after ww1 , not by germany , we did n't take it from them , we took it from france ( lon ) . 
   '' in september 1919 , during attack against the soviets , lithuanian army occupied much of il\u016bkste municipality and threatened to take daugavpils as well . 
  between late august and early september , 1920 latvian army pushed lithuanians out . '', 
  that happened because latvian did n't want us to give access to baltic sea , since we still did n't have control over klaip\u0117da region . 
  there are always two sides of the coin . 
   yeah , that 's my point the second biggest one with soviet russia out of the picture due to peace treaty poland became number one . 
   i 'm not talking about polish `` heroism '' i 'm talking about political situation of that time , and it is that if soviets would defeat poland , independence of lithuania would be very short . 
  what was point of your comment other than show up that poland somehow magically saved lithuania . 
  i talked about lithuanian and german ( spec . 
  saxon ) soldiers who fought for lithuanian freedom , poland and their army did n't fight for lithuanian freedom , they fought for their own , why should i feel obligated to be thankful ? 
   and every time i see this map on reddit i cringe true , but there is no denial that lithuanian language was spoken by majority in vilnius region and it held more history to lithuania than to poland . 
   yes we failed , but we did n't split . 
  we basically lost war , was n't able to achieve original goals , which was to dismantle russian empire . 
  partially because ukrainians did not want to support petlura 's governement , and ukrainian troops failed to capture odessa , which was a city of strategical importance ( with the sea port upr was able to sell grains to the west , which not suprisingly was one thing they cared about ) . 
  and we did n't split any territory since galicja was a part of polish territory according to pilsudski-petlura treaty . 
  soviets did n't want to include upr representative during peace talks since they were claiming that there is only one ukrainian state - ukrainian soviet republic . 
  polish side was strong enough to pursue on this matter ( and it was basically imposible ) . 
  and we annexed large regions on the east . 
  but we were either a majoirty there ( galicia , wilno ) or sizeable minority ( you can see here .
