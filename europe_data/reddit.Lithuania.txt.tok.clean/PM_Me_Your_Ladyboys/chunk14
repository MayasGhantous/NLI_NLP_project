  plus we are talking about belarusians and ukrainians which were a stateless nations back than . 
  we did not held any territories were the majority were people of any neighboring countries , whic could n't be said about all our neighbours ( polish majority regions were in lithuania , germany , russia and czechoslovakia ) . 
  sounds like typical apologism . 
   it just pissing me off when lithuanians are pretending they were neighbors , constantly under polish thread . 
  so coup d'tat did n't happen ? 
  polish-lithuanian war did n't happen ? 
  is that what you 're trying to say to me ? 
  you did n't talk shit about lithuania in paris peace conf . 
  like that we would n't survive as a small nation ? 
  jesus , get off your high horse . 
   you were backstabing almost every of your neighbors . 
  germany when you anexed memel , poland on many occasions , mostly during polish-soviet war , latvia during their struggle with soviets . 
  man you love to talk shit about lithuania , but refuse to see poland in bad light ... do you even known existance of [ lithuania minor ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/lithuania_minor.png ) ( kleinlitauen ) ? 
  i guess not . 
  talking about poland you took territories you never held before , including vilnius region , it was never part of polish crown let alone kingdom of poland . 
   latvia during their struggle with soviets . 
  never heard of it , enlighten me . 
   you can be neutral or not , if you are not then you are ally . 
  lithuania was pursuing short-sighted anti-polish policy , i get that you may seen as enemies , but it was rather obvious for everyone that russia , escpecially soviet russia , is far the biggest thread to everyone . 
  your view of what is alliance is vague yet again . 
  stop talking bs . 
  we were not their allies and it 's not surprise we had short sighted anti-polish view when you were our second biggest threat to independence , you tried coup d'tat and now were fighting in open conflict . 
   you are just proving how small-minded nationalist you are . 
  and brining polish `` heroism '' into talks about german and lithuanian fight against soviet russia is not small minded nationalism ? 
  please . 
   excpet vilnius and to some extent suwa\u0142ki and memel regions those lands never were lithuanian in ethnographic sense , only ( in excpetion of memelland ) were within borders of medieval and early modern lithuania . 
  [ yes they were . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanians#/media/file:etnoregionai.png ) unless you know better than all the historians and lingustics scientists ? 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg/800px-baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg.png ) ; [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png/800px-lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png )  border between poland and ukraine was established after polish-western ukrainian war of 1919 in the pilsudski-petlura treaty . 
  and the border was the same as polish eastern border established in riga peace treaty . 
  in fact goal of polish offensive against soviets was to establish independent ukraine , and after capturing kiev governement of upr was created there , at that time poland was only country alongside latvia and finland which was recognising ukrainian state . 
  which you failed and just split the territories to yourself and soviet russia instead of keeping your original plan . 
  poland annexed non polish lands , no excuse on it , you blame lithuanians for wanting non-lithuanian lands , while keeping blind eye . 
  * kettle calling pot black * . 
  for you , not for us . 
  take us all . 
   `` the treaty also contained a secret clause allowing soviet forces unrestricted movement within soviet-recognized lithuanian territory for the duration of soviet hostilities with poland ; this clause would lead to questions regarding the issue of lithuanian neutrality in the ongoing polish-soviet war '' our neutrality was questionable , does n't mean we were their allies . 
   of course you should be thankful . 
  well i 'm not , they might as well burn in hell like soviets do . 
   it does not matter . 
  lithuania had some imperialistic goals back then , wanted to gain lands without any lithuanian presence or with very small minority : wilno , grodno , suwa\u0142ki , memel and so on . 
  those were not imperialistic goals , only ethnographic regions where lithuanians used to be majority before other nations took over with their people . 
  besides memelland was at least half lithuanian so hardly a small minority . 
  grodno and suwalki were n't important as vilnius or klaip\u0117da regions . 
  plus there were talks about lithuania becoming multicultural state , equal to belgium . 
  besides talking about lithuanian non-ethnic ambitions , you think poland was any different ? 
  [ here ] ( http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/slovo/files/2014/03/ukr-3.png ) you can look it up yourself . 
   at the polish side were troops of ukrainian and belarusian people 's republics they were on your side because you promised them their independence . 
  while in the end you sold half of their land to soviet russia while annexed other half . 
  please do n't talk bull shit , i 'm not buying it . 
   white russians , hungarians send ammunition and guns , latvians were also fighting alongside polish forces . 
  their enemy was also commies so no surprise they fought along side , that does n't mean they cared , or you cared about their nation state . 
   so no , we were n't fighting just for ourselves . 
  yes you were . 
  i cry every time . 
   you have zero knowledge abotu this time period . 
  you surely talking about yourself . 
   first of all you led soviet troops to march throughout your territory we did n't lead anybody , they marched through territory they recognize to us , but we never held de facto control , only de jure . 
   it means of course you were they allies you have really vague look at what alliance is . 
  i guess poland was also ally of ussr . 
   secondly you annexed large portions of polish and belarusian lands . 
  it 's you not us who did that . 
  we never annexed any of those territories , just held de jure control , the only de facto control we had was during german occupation . 
   thirdly recognition by soviets meant almost nothing back then since soviet government was n't recognised by western powers as a legal russian government . 
  that 's not the point , we wanted to secure our eastern borders before paris peace conf . 
  so ussr would be recognized without us being in it . 
   and of course if poland would collapse you would became another soviet republic in no time no shit , hungary would fall , germany would fall , might all of europe fall , why should we be thankful ? 
  why not germans , french ? 
  again poland fought for its own survival not for german , hungariarn , french , let alone lithuanian cause . 
  so i do n't give a shit about polish victory against ussr , these are not soldiers that i should be thankful for . 
  good job slovenia , i 'm proud of you . 
  tri-color master race . 
  though [ medieval flags ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/pol_coa_pogo\u0144_litewska_ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119ca.svg/400px-pol_coa_pogo\u0144_litewska_ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119ca.svg.png ) are also master race . 
   hahaha , you did not protect anything , just made an alliance with commies if you call a [ peace treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet\u2013lithuanian_peace_treaty ) an alliance you 're an idiot . 
   just to see poland in ruins that 's not what we wanted , our goal was to be recognized and left alone , we did n't give two shits about your country . 
  besides should have thought that before attacking us and even trying to do [ coup d'\u00e9tat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_polish_coup_d'\u00e9tat_attempt_in_lithuania ) , you were no different than any other imperilistic country in the region , after all you sold out half of belarus and parts of ukraine to ussr . 
  lol ? 
  glorious poland saves the day lol , fuck off , you did n't fight for us , you fought for yourself . 
  i 'm here to glorify german and lithuanian soldiers who fought to protect lithuania , not poland . 
  lol, 
  it 's fresh acc , what would you expect . 
  well economic hardship does breed some retards who think capitalism is evil . 
  every person that sided with soviet is seen in disgrace here . 
  moment antanas snie\u010dkus became leader of lssr under ussr , his own parents disowned him . 
  just put flag of london ( new micro state of europe ) and scotland . 
  yeah i know about red terror , but these were just babysteps compare to stalin 's regime . 
  this was during first soviet occupation ( 1940-1941 ) :  according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive. , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  happy independence day , estonija !, 
  actually we won against the [ westward offensive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) unless you 're talking about one during ww2 . 
  which is why poland is calling itself third republic and not second ( interwar ) one . 
  that picture could n't be more polish . 
  what racist beliefs ? 
  when you think about german you do n't think about black guy , when you think about pole you do n't think about asian , now , do you ? 
  i do n't give a shit what nazis considered to be humans , they considered lithuanians to be part of master race , next day they saying we interbred with poles too much and need `` purification '' simply because we did n't ally with them . 
  so chill your nipples , poles are europeans , denying it is like white man saying he 's a asian . 
   then how come we 're in northern geographic region if we 're in the center of europe ? 
  there are different centers of europe , why are you trying to convince me that we are `` center of europe '' , we 're not . 
   if these are just geographic regions , why were you bringing up catholicism and slavs when explaining why we do n't belong in eastern europe ? 
  did i ? 
  you talking to other dude you know ?
