   what is a geographic region in this case ? 
  a fucking geographic region , we 're up north , as much as denmark , no less eastern than finland , that 's about it . 
   why is spain considered southern europe when it 's the westernmost country in europe ? 
  are you really that retarded ? 
   why ca n't you just admit that you do n't like to be called eastern european simply because eastern europe is shown negatively in media ? 
  of course it is one of the reasons , you would be blind af to not recognize it . 
  could also be prussian lithuanian influence , modern standard lithuanian is mix between prussian lithuanian and auk\u0161taitian dialects . 
  done re search , there are . 
  not as cute as lithuanian ones tho . 
   uhh , no offense lithuania , but with that risk of a personal union under poland , you are no valuable ally . 
  make prussia happen , pretend it 's baltic and we will pu it . 
  no need airforce , we will just install a king . 
  same stuff . 
  the fact you 're white ? 
  you are european wtf . 
  n. european = / = nordic/scandinavian ( do you even know the difference between these ? ), 
  or anything else , it 's just geographical region , jeez . 
  spain is n't arabic ? 
  we accept joint attack on poland this time . 
  know you know why we call france - `` pranc\u016bzija '' and not `` franc\u016bzija '' . 
  nobody can beat your potato jokes . 
   u\u017esidaro savo burn\u0105 , lietuvos you should write it in english , it sounds ... retarded . 
  meh , we 're both , take that !, 
   and the knight is a ritter in german funny , due to teutonic order , i assume it 's how we got our name for knight - `` riteris '' . 
  given that it spans through both finnic tribes and baltic tribes , one would said so . 
  most of old prussians assimilated to either germans , poles or lithuanians . 
  no , it 's a colour . 
  i was thinking the same . 
  nope , but it 's clear as day they would been a total wasteland if it was n't for foreign funding . 
  to prevent advancement for 72h till nato troops can fully mobilize and kick invader out of our countries . 
  they let us go because they would get fucked by economical blockade , cutting off foreign funds that stopped them from becoming a wasteland of warlords . 
  i 'm not going to argue with you , you 're trying to convince that victim should n't be angry for being raped because victim was not killed . 
  that 's some sadistic logic you have here . 
   that 's obviously wrong . 
  russia backed off and gave you what you wanted without a war . 
  they still kept their army inside our borders until 1994 due to international pressure . 
  thing is that they were too weak and bankrupted to create conflict . 
  they ran over dozen people while shooting and beating up thousand of un-armed civilians , you need to realize that american and worlds eyes were on lithuanian path of independence road was foreseen by tv 's , after the events international pressure happened , even millions of russian came to streets to protest soviet atrocities . 
  that 's why they tried to take over tv and radio stations of lithuania , so they could spread their propaganda that it 's actually lithuanians who are shooting and injuring each other . 
  so please fuck off with your narrative that we should be thankful for russia letting us go . 
  it 's like saying be thankful for rapist not killing you , just raping you , now be friends . 
  famous gorbachevs words that they wo n't use army , next thing you see omon assaults on lithuanian border posts and army against civilians . 
  fucking lying prick should burn in hell . 
   but was n't pilsudski considered a dictator ? 
   russians gave them freedom without war . 
  yeah right . 
  : dd what are you smoking ? 
  russia destroyed it all . 
  france had a boatload of commies before ww2 does n't mean whole nation wants to be a soviet shit hole . 
  poland-lithuania will succeed . 
  [ russians really like sneaking in instead of zerging in . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqfbkjnryn0&amp;t=387s#t=5m30s ), 
  maybe because you surround yourself with them ... 
  agriculture ? 
  too make sure nobility were ' t starving . 
  retaining our original language , no influenced by german/polish/russian nobility ? 
  i ca n't really name all , but there was a reason they existed . 
  the [ french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_iii_of_france ) one will run away as soon as he will sit on the throne . 
   one is ethnically , culturally and linguistically related with it , other is a close friend with one that planned total genocide of slavs . 
  you forget that russia also tried to erase our nationality while germany is the reason why our language did n't completely disappeared . 
  white and black , i feel bad for you . 
  should have kept your hands in your own pockets . 
  not wealthiest best best looking , because of few remaining prussian architecture . 
  you do realize how simple it is to acquire latvian and estonian citizen to ethnic russians that live inside the country , knowing basic official language and history of respected countries , and you 're good to go . 
  soviet tank used during january events when soviets tried to take over radio/tv stations etc. 
  so they could spread their propaganda which common people did n't allow so they used those tanks to ran over people . 
  [ for that you will need lithuanian dynasty . 
  poles from poland are cool dudes , `` poles '' from lithuania are some next level chads . 
   the japanese were taking baths poland is exception on this . 
  true fact , samurais would use a brand new sword on first random peasant they saw . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/589cgx/was_medieval_lithuania_actually_the_grand/ ) is an example of what i 'm talking about . 
  even now some fucked up brit calling me and lithuania a slavic nation . 
  my ignorance , it 's you who does n't even try to do research about lithuanians , we 're indo-europeans ( who came to modern lithuanian lands 3-5k years ago ) who mixed with og n. europeans ( who settled to modern lithuanian territories 10k years ago , like basques ) . 
  if you made a lil ' bit of research you would know that lithuanian genetic make up did n't change since neolithic times and that we 're closer to finns , estonians and latvians than we are to russians ( excluding russified finno-ugrians that resided northern european part of russia ) . 
  culturally we 're closer to poles and germans due to being last pagan state to adopt christianity and being baptised by both of them as roman catholics . 
  you clearly know how huge role of religion used to be on culture . 
  we use latin alphabet they use cyrillic . 
  english and german languages are also related to slavic languages does that also make them slavic ? 
  oh wait you 're just a common troll not an educated linguist . 
  besides standard lithuanian language is biased on ** prussian lithuanian ** and ** auk\u0161taitian ** dialects , i can understand most of the samogitian words , but lithuanians barely can recognize latvian language let alone russian or polish . 
  let 's not even begin with politics we always looked up west , while russia kept being with it 's own unique eastern identity . 
  during occupation by russia ( 1795-1918 ) we had two uprisings during ( mid xix c. ) which both failed and the russifaction as started by tsar ( language , literature , latin alphabet , roman catholism , hanging , deporting people ) , but it also failed miserably because book from lithuanian minor ( east prussia ) were printed and smuggled to lithuanian lands that were annexed by russia , literally made 0 influence . 
  the only thing that we have common with russia is commieblocks that eu funds are making western looking , which gradually will mean we will have no architecture similarity . 
  this is just a drop of unique lithuanian history , i 'm sick and not in a mood to debate with an idiot who screams that we 're slavs . 
  a lot of belarusian that i met for some reason think like this e.g. 
  full of litvinism . 
  so now we 're slavs , pathetic trolling . 
  i mean , do you consider gdl only a successor state to belarus , and modern lithuanians just imposers ? 
  go educate yourself first before talking total non-sense or carving facts to fit your political agenda, 
  sorry , australia will not resist joining glorious yurop ' federation , instead of world wars we will make [ world song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6qst8qp9ck ) contest .

  just choose which ever you want . 
  do n't take w. toma\u0161veski , he 's a cunt . 
  it 's actually true , estonian barely have any connection with aestii .
