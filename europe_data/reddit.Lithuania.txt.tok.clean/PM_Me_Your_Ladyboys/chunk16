  it was complicated days back then , brother of your first president was one of signatory of act of independence of lithuania , who oppose any union with poland since he knew lithuania was too small to be a equal partner , he wanted us to become something like belgium . 
   how old is the nation of lithuanians ? 
  romans called us aestii , during 1009 first mention of lithuania ( as a name ) appeared , during xiii c. lithuania was formed into kingdom , but due to complicated history we were grand duchy till 1569 when kingdom of poland and grand duchy of lithuania formed a single state - polish-lithuanian commonwealth or for foreigners known as just `` the republic '' / `` nobles republic '' with elective king . 
  during 1790 's we were getting partitioned by austrian , russian empires and prussian kingdom , in which 1795 was the last time we were on political map . 
  after that we sat 123 years under russian empire , except klaip\u0117da region which was part of east prussia ( later german empire ) . 
  two revolts , oppression happened , the great war happened that brought vacuum power into the region which helped us to gain independence once again . 
  -  what is their origin ? 
  long story short we 're mix of og northern europeans ( that settled 10k years ago ) and indo-europeans ( that settled 3.5 k years ago in modern lithuanian ) . 
  indo-europeans  balto-slavs  balts  east balts  lithuanians . 
  - both wikipedia on history of [ lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_lithuania ) and [ balts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) ( our ethnicity ) is pretty accurate . 
  [ european genes man . 
   i was taught in school you ( we ) are much older :d hope you 're not talking about litvinism . 
   the samogitians and auk\u0161taitians and prussian lithuanians , most of modern standardized lithuanian language consist of prussian lithuanian and auk\u0161taitian dialect , that 's why we have a hard time understanding lithuanians from samogitian regions . 
  at least we got your name right , suomija . 
  do n't forget pilsudski , he was also lithuanian . 
  :p lithuanians best leaders of poland . 
   oberf\u00fchrer adolf ax , commander of the 15th division , reported on 27 january 1945 : `` they are first and foremost latvians . 
  they want a sustainable latvian nation state . 
  forced to choose between germany and russia , they have chosen germany , because they seek co-operation with western civilization . 
  the rule of the germans seems to them to be the lesser of two evils . 
  '' [ 13 ] this perspective resulted in part from the soviet occupation between 1940 and 1941 , called `` the year of terror '' ( latvian : baigais gads ) during which tens of thousands of latvian families were executed or deported to siberia with men separated from the women and children to break down resistance . 
  -  this sentiment was also reflected in one of the most popular legion songs which went `` we will beat the russians now and we will beat the germans after that '' ( with euphemisms for russians and germans ) . 
  [ 6 ] the allies confirmed this as early as 1943 , when a british investigative mission found latvians stood against both their soviet and german occupiers -  `` the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states . 
  well russia is ancient adversary to both of us . 
  do n't forget australia , our esc took over their hearts . 
   aestii i think it 's a name given to proto-old prussians , or at least several balt tribes , due to geographical proximity of the name given on map it does n't even border estonia . 
   despite the phonological similarity between aestui and the modern ethnonyms of estonia , especially in popular etymologies , the two geographical areas are not contiguous and there are few , if any , direct historical links between them . 
  he 's uneducated in the matter , most of africa was still colonies without flags when lithuania became independent . 
  african countries with such colour patterns did n't exist back then , they were still colonies you know . 
  it 's africa who stole our pattern , not us . 
  if you want to even try to troll at least buy acc instead of creating one . 
  actually there were jews who showed insane brutality towards lithuanian people , like nachman dushanski who was involved in rainiai massacre . 
  yeah , like [ jews ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nachman_dushanski ) are innocent beings , before nazi occupation they painted themselves as soviet collaborators with twisted minds . 
  besides whole of bloody europe was killing jews under nazi occupation . 
  lithuanian lost more population due to soviet regime than nazi one . 
  you do realize it was complicated matter during interwar when nationalism was strengthening more and more . 
  ** stanis\u0142aw narutowicz ** was brother of first polish president - gabriel narutowicz , who supported lithuanian independence , one of the twenty signatories of the act of independence of lithuania , who did n't want poland and lithuania to be one nation again because he knew poland would fully over take the unified country again . 
  instead he envisioned lithuania as something as belgium is , he wanted `` state 's patriotism '' not nationalism . 
  because irish bros are like w. european version of us . 
  [ we 're the ones that broke livonian order . 
  :d ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_saule ), 
  yes , indeed . 
  [ do n't worry , we love americans that are here . 
  ey , as long as words are nice i do n't mind them to be said in the respective languages . 
  technically we are [ 1k years old ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_lithuania ) during 2009 . 
  it 's a sign , start learning [ lithuanian language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_language ) , embrace lithuanian culture ( [ like dancing around bonfire in middle of night ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_jonas%27_festival ) ) and become [ balt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) ( white/pure ( lt ) , perk\u016bnas is your god now . 
  between 1795-1917 we were n't independent . 
  [ germans are bros , never forget . 
  but you 're nato buddy . 
  but eesti , does n't your name mean east ? 
  kingdom of lithuania under mindaugas only . 
  well we can relate as we get mad when we 're called russians while having no connection to russia , contrary to sweden and finland . 
   the first iteration of the eu was the `` european economic community '' with the sole purpose of economic integration which is exactly what would make war unworthy between european nations . 
  it is inevitable given russia 's stance , good deterrence means peace . 
  one word - petrostate . 
  the liveability of russian people come with oil price . 
   like creating majority of balkan 's nations , saving christian caucasian nations all of this other than finland was done due to trying to expand sphere of influence . 
   and , of course , giving an independence to finland ? 
  are you ok ? 
  so all the crimes of russian nation should be white washed because you gave independence to finland . 
  it 's me who should ask you if your mental state is okay . 
   yeah , i know , ignorance is pretty high over here :  too bad only nazi regime fell , i wish soviets would fallen as well as nazis did , half of europe would n't be fucked under enforced commie garbage ideology . 
  nope , they were poor af to stop it . 
  russian empire times ( 1795-1918 ) were not sweet either . 
  deporting , hanging , banning literature , language , roman catholic religion even latin alphabet just to try to russify the lands . 
  [ though thank god east prussia existed . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) < 3, 
   estonian , whoes people were so productive in jews/russian extermination you do realize half of estonian jews were killed by soviets during first occupation of estonia ? 
  because ussr was crumbling itself , it had no time nor money to expose hard power . 
  return russia to poland-lithuania . 
  honestly reddit trolls are getting more shitty with every passing day . 
  it was * dues vult * . 
  i was once approached by these guys while walking down the street , i was so confused on what the hellish bullshit they were talking about and just walked away after i realized , that was enough . 
  after you drop lutheranism , pagan is life . 
  yes , i 'm lithuanian that got christianize during mindaugas reign . 
  i 'm iron werewolf , i made one duke scared once so much he built city on that place . 
  damn we got nothing left ... * ei braliukas , maybe wan na do that federation of balts , which we talked during interwar period ? 
  sorry we 're in dynastic union with germany . 
  * lietuvininkai we 're are born . 
  * `` evil fascist forces taking picture of ivangorod fortress before bombarding it to the ground '' *, 
  [ hehe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxtphnmdozu#t=42s ), 
  ask latvia for potato , oh wait ... 
  losing one testicle during the great war probably hit him hard . 
  man , croatia and serbia are like extreme versions of poland and lithuania . 
  croats are roman catholic bros. 
  sorry , i 'm on their side . 
  in history classes ww2 is huge here on european scene , but barely show pacific scene one . 
  i would never justify their racist policy , what i 'm saying is that their racist policy depended on nation individually and given different circumstances . 
   lithuanians were very willing to do it , your compatriotes basically killed 95 % of all lithuanian jews during three-four months , and we are talking about population of 200k jews in a 2mln nation . 
  yes , shame , a dark chapter in our history . 
  quite frankly nazis use a lot of shit that was used before hand , e.g. 
  swastika is predominant piece of symbol in european pagan and hindu culture , nazi salute is actually roman salute . 
  nazism in hitler 's eyes was viewed as greater europe project , to unify whole of continent under * ein volk ein reich ein f\u00fchrer * . 
  * croatia embracing nazism again . 
  * russia loves to throw shit about europe as fascist/nazi states/people etc. 
  just like they do with latvian ss legion that was specifically created to fight bolshevik forces , not even usa consider latvian ss legion a threat , let alone common saying in latvian ss legion was `` we fight russians now , we fight germans tomorrow '' something like that . 
  we 're not slavs but ... lithuanians were [ considered by hitler ] ( http://www.lituanus.org/1965/65_1_03_slavenas.html ) as part of `` master race '' ( iirc he said it himself during speech ) , plus that 's one of the reasons why lithuania fell initially in hitler 's [ sphere of influence map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/ribbentrop-molotov.svg/1024px-ribbentrop-molotov.svg.pnghttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/ribbentrop-molotov.svg/1024px-ribbentrop-molotov.svg.png ) , that secret protocol was in molotov -- ribbentrop pact ) . 
  after we refused to ally with them ( because we prosecuted nazis during interwar period and after [ ultimatum ( 1939 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_german_ultimatum_to_lithuania ) we had to hand over [ klaip\u0117da region ] ( http://www.nccg.org/preussen/memelland.jpg\\ ) ) and be the third party to attack poland , from the north , to get back the lost vilnius city - our historical capital and all the surrounding regions ( that were previously inhabited by lithuanians but due to complicated history became majority polish speaking ) that been lost during [ polish-lithuanian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_war ) . 
  after [ first soviet invasion ( 1940 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_the_baltic_states_ ( 1940 \\ ) ) which lasted for one or two years was done in brutal ways that people have been greeting nazis with flowers and applauses and shouting to them `` liberators '' . 
  but since we did n't had best relations with nazi germany given that we refused to be with them allies and did n't do joint attack on poland , nazi plans were to exterminate 85 % of lithuanians , but during occupation nazis never targeted lithuanians ( contrary they wanted to use us a a weapon on exterminating poles and jews , given our ever growing hatred towards them during interwar period ( note poles ) and soviet occupation ( note lithuanian jews were sympathizers of soviets ) , so they targeted only jews and slavs .
