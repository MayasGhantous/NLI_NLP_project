  since lithuanians are balts , we never actually fell into `` sub-human '' category , our position depended on how willingly population was to collaborate with nazi regime . 
  during occupation nazis speculated about our potential to be actually put in higher hierarchy . 
   to promote `` desirable traits '' , rosenberg appointed three german historians and archeologists to study remnants of german culture in lithuania , as well as in the two other baltic territories .22  in matters of german culture lithuania appeared to be a liability . 
  thus , walter zimmermann in his article `` mit alfred rosenberg durchs ostland '' stated that because of previous polish influence the `` general district of lithuania '' was quite different from estonia and latvia . 
  nevertheless , zimmermann concluded by saying : `` we know that the lithuanians too are basically upright people and have a lot of good blood . 
  `` 23 the idea was expressed that the upright lithuanians would collaborate with the germanization policies and thus improve themselves racially , but this was precisely what the lithuanians were unwilling to do . 
  besides given our [ genetic ] ( http://imgur.com/xozpi0o ) make up it 's no surprise why nazi german forces occupying us did n't see us `` sub-human '' . 
  edit : do n't know why the downvotes , what i said was truth , hitler 's `` master race '' was vague af . 
   we 're the ** thailand ** of ** europe ** did i hear ... my two most favorite words ? 
  still as much as i 'm grateful for usa 's presence and securing my country 's safety i do want european army to be created asap to stop being reliant on usa and so it return would n't need to stand next to them in everything they do . 
  but gooks you keep in your government do . 
   it 's ot , i know , but every time i read `` lithuania '' i ca n't help but think of those blondies . 
  [ mostly because people think that only scandinavia is filled with blonde people . 
  iirc just make sure lithuania or poland not get close to each other , one of them will fuck up in retarded wars and will be gone , without one the other is weak . 
  time to further colonize [ curonian spit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curonian_spit ) and name it new miami ... wait ... that sounds like usa 's colony name !, 
  russia was right we 're occupied by nato !, 
  at least germany will rip us from russian hands fast . 
  why would you do that in the first place ? 
  not like we lack beautiful places ... 
   i 'm not denying that , hell , all i 've said is we call dzukija `` litwa '' same as your state and that many and in english we never use term dzukija but term `` lithuania '' for that region and i added that many poles are from that region . 
  what 's the point of doing that ? 
   that 's true it was n't part of kingdom of poland but part of gdl , however poland is successor of plc , not only kingdom of poland , that 's why are views are different , we often saw that region as `` ours '' / `` polish '' as of plc. 
  even in plc , crown of poland did n't held the lands , the grand duchy ' and it 's nobility within plc did . 
  plc was not just a polish state but also lithuanian , jewish , german and ruthenian . 
  poland holds no special right to it . 
   that 's weird ` couse my family is from eastern part of that region and before wwii they considered themselves poles , poles from lithuania ( `` dzukija '' as you may prefer ) , but still poles , they did n't have double identinty . 
  different people . 
  i doubt they had lithuanian roots . 
   that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  what i 'm saying is : you call it `` dzukija '' we `` lithuania '' but we are talking about similar thing , a region . 
  there was no special `` lithuania '' it 's all about semantics dude . 
  why would any one call a region within lithuania `` lithuania '' that 's so retarded . 
   etnically ? 
  probably . 
  nationally ? 
  well , no , not really , he considered himself polish . 
  he considered himself polish-lithuanian and would also point out his multi-cultural heritage , not just calling himself pole . 
   no need to go for classic ultranationalist lithuanian mode an throw shit in poland . 
  where do you see me doing that ? 
   however dzukija is a place of origin of many poles and in polish we still simply call it litwa ( lithuania in polish ) . 
  hope now you get why so many poles use term lithuania while they mean dzukija . 
  what a joke . 
  before polish-lithuanian commonwealth the region was lithuanian speaking , after that it became multi-cultural hub , it was as much polish as it was lithuanian , jewish or belarusian . 
  the region did n't belong to poland before interwar period . 
  the region is place of origin for polish-lithuanians , not poles . 
  you 're just misinterpreting our own region for your own narrative that some kind of `` other '' , `` special '' lithuania existed . 
  as if true lithuania was `` polish speaking part of lithuania '' by poles . 
  again what a joke . 
   what , are going to pretend you are an unbiased neutral and not a nato fan boi ? 
  lithuanian independence lasted 1991-2004 , rip . . lol, 
   pi\u0142sudski was pole from lithuania his family roots date to pagan times , he was ethnically lithuanian who spoke polish , a remnant of polish-lithuanian commonwealth , therefore a polish-lithuanian . 
   therefore lithuanian ( as of lithuania , a region , not a baltic state ) lithuania was not a region back then any more . 
  but for ultra nationalist pole , lithuania will always stay a schizophrenic province of poland , i guess . 
  got your biased view . 
  nato is not a nation , independent nations choose to be involved in libya . 
  he was not neither polish nor lithuania , he was polish-lithuanian . 
  as long as we do n't mix too much we 're good . 
   a referendum on the act of declaration of independence was held in ukraine on 1 december 1991 . 
  an overwhelming majority of 92.3 % of voters approved the declaration of independence made by the verkhovna rada on 24 august 1991 . 
  that map is ugly af . 
   so when we use nation in modern times we use that as people not rulers . 
  so looking from that angle belorussians actually do have exact same right calling old lithuania or gdol their ancestors . 
  if you ever read lithuanian history books you would know that we 're not denying that . 
  that 's why we should share , instead of claiming that it was pure belarusians ( slavic ) state or pure lithuanian ( baltic ) state . 
  there is a propaganda video that shows that gdl was pure belarusian state . 
  take one lithuania as your president and be great again . 
  actually we did use several names for germany including niemcy , the name differ through centuries . 
  we took down rome !, 
  go danija , you can do it !, 
  you know shit 's fucked up when you welcome with joy nazis coming to your country after first soviet invasion and occupation . 
  after first soviet occupation lithuanians were happy to see german army crossing the border ... 
  well it makes sense then . 
  democracy is always one generation from extinction , but very unlikely given our position . 
   you had the answer in your own comment already : point them out . 
   where is ussr ? 
  doesnt exist , nato is still here after fall of ussr , nato 's main purpose was to make sure neither of european nations ever go to war between each other . 
  just do it slowly , come back to us , let us be grand again . 
  for people who are interested in [ this myth ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/589cgx/was_medieval_lithuania_actually_the_grand ) . 
  i mean , why ca n't we fucking share ? 
  we 're not claiming that gdl was some kind of lithuanian empire , but multi-cultural state that was started by lithuanians . 
  that 's why it 's always mentioned that gdl was multi-cultural state whose full name was grand duchy of lithuania , ruthenia and samogitia . 
  for lithuanians it would be gudxit . 
  belarus is far from n. korean level . 
  same with lithuania and smetona , he saw lithuania as potential ally ( even from his own mouth words came that we 're part of the `` master race '' ) . 
  you need to realize hitler did n't saw england , poland or lithuania as enemies , he wanted them to be allies with him , but nazism is hella drug . 
  belarus barely oppose russia , so it gets insanely cheap gas deals . 
  fuck this [ guy 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky#northwestern_krai_governor_general ) grave particularly . 
  [ please be kind this time . 
  nato was anti ussr , not anti-russia . 
  it 's russians who think that nato is some kind of anti-russian organization , when in fact russia was asked to join by ** polish ** politician . 
  and may i ask how is nato anti-russian organization ? 
  by not allowing small nations being fucked over like georgia , moldova and ukraine are ? 
  the union was enforced after napoleon 's defeat which danes were allied with . 
  `` you will never have your independence , it 's un-imaginable , un-realistic , come to terms , total capitulation , we will give you more autonomy , instead of 7 % of profit income , we will give you 20 % ... '' m. gorbachev words to v. landsbergis, 
  oh yeah i forgot big evil nato alliance will eat russian babies ... are you fucking kidding me ? 
  only central asian countries voted to remain . 
  there were a failed `` polish separatist republic '' during that time which polish government refused to support . 
  man you 're schizophrenic . 
  you do realize poland and lithuania acted as allies before both of us started to claim vilnius ? 
  as long as nordic banks invest here with several eu funds our economy will recover fast .
