  [ have you seen this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqfbkjnryn0&amp;t=510s ), 
  gudija is your true name , no more belarus . 
  dw lenkija , we are already ahead of you , after you annex us , vokietija will annex you . 
  h\u0104h\u0104h\u0104h\u0104h\u0104h\u0104h\u0104 ... 
  he said he wanted us to be big and stronk , with lithuanian on polish presidency throne . 
  there are many things why we did it . 
  most notable , distancing ourselves from multi-cultural gdl and soviet looking flags , because interwar polish government was talking shit about us in international conferences ( being soviet puppet , ally etc. ), 
  so we took most predominant colours of lithuanian folk lore - red and green , yellow was added to make flag look less depressing . 
  pretty sure we already doing that . 
  still going to swinger party with nordics is more fun . 
  we can , but we do n't want to . 
  [ this is how it sounds . 
  neo-commonwealth confirmed . 
  [ i forget how huge we used to be . 
  i have russia neighbour so i know that they 're people as much as us . 
  that still does n't make us one branch . 
  funny thing , my home town is named radvili\u0161kis ( named after radziwi\u0142\u0142 family since they ruled that land ) . 
  the killings were promoted by both soviets and nazis . 
  even then nazis were seen as liberators and lesser evil compare to soviet crimes . 
  lithuania was just normal country in europe with growing nationalism and fetish for germany until rise of nazism which made them our nr . 
  1 enemy . 
  that 6.8 gone back to russia . 
  he promised that soviet troops will not cross lithuanian border . 
  he lied [ [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania \\ ) ) ] ;[ [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_omon_assaults_on_lithuanian_border_posts ) ] . 
   nato should have a strong presence in lithuania . 
  which is why german troops are stationed here . 
  i happy to see this but go to russian sub-reddit and see what they think about baltic states being independent . 
  well back then russians hated as much soviet union as we did , after all during january events several thousands of russian gone to moscow streets to protest soviet aggresion towards baltic states . 
   it 's not anymore . 
  but it was . 
  it took you 70 years of depolonization programs to make it ethnically lithuanian . 
  blame soviets , not us , we did n't choose to ethnically cleanse the lands , the only thing our commie leader did was preventing russians populating the vilnius after poles been expelled by the soviets . 
  plus those poles saw themselves as polish-lithuanian , not just polish . 
  pilsudski was from noble lithuania family that dated back to pagan times . 
  probably because kaliningrad was n't attached to lithuania . 
   well , lithuania could have become bilingual country ( with polish and lithuania as national languages ) allowing wilno/vilnius to be part of restored lithuania . 
  which is exactly what lithuania would been . 
  prussian-lithuanians in the west , polish-lithuanians in the east and just non-germanized/polonized lithuanians in the middle . 
  there were poles who sided with lithuania during interwar period , the conflict between region was the reason why lithuania slowly was evolving it 's hatred towards polish people , it was like that at the start . 
   considering what happened in ponary during wwii , i 'm kind of glad vilnius stayed polish . 
  you know nothing about lithuania during periods of interwar . 
  you just blindly look at nazi/soviet regime times . 
   our goverments during 90 's wanted to have best relations with our eastern neighbour as possible . 
  which is nice because ussr tried to create polish separatist republic in some parts of vilnius region which polish goverment refused to support . 
  saved us a lot of trouble . 
   independence from russia / germany ( 1918 ) russia empire had de jure right over land , but germany had de facto control , both are correct . 
  that would mean annexing whole of belarus , parts of russia and poland , also whole western ukraine . 
  it 's complicated . 
  you fucked up during interwar , lenkija , we can only be `` friends '' now . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/d/de_prus1.gif ) you 're right , [ lietuvininkai we 're born ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_lithuanians#/media/file:wilhelm1.jpg ) . 
  i think we did . 
  it shows that our languages only share few features that other branches do n't but that 's about it , baltic and slavic languages are on two different levels . 
  yy , france and germany or turkey and greece , there are boatload of examples , belarus has no enemies in europe , your narrative does n't make sense either . 
   the soviets are seen as a lesser ( ? ), 
  evil nazi germany was lesser evil for baltics ( do not use word balts because that excludes estonia ) because ussr was targeting all citizens ( young or old ) , not just jews . 
  what ? 
  eu removes some of sanctions of lukashenko do something that promotes human rights , you know . 
  hope that finally means closer ties with eu and nato than russia . 
   the original poster was saying that lithuanians `` have nothing in common linguistically '' with russians , which is of course a nonsence statement , as both slavic and baltic languages are often unified into the same group . 
  so what ? 
  that means our language is closer to polish not russian . 
  and unifying them in one branch is retarded , i can find grammar similarities within latvian language , but slavic languages are on whole next level of gibberish . 
   you say you share nothing with russia geogrophically , but you share russian kaliningrad region in the west and belarus , which is really similar to russia in the east . 
  maybe / u/nar _ el_ashwa [ -3 ] is n't the only one having alzheimer ? 
  kaliningrad before soviet invasion and ethnic cleansing was part of germany with lithuanian minority in it so of course it will look similar , just because russian colonists happen to fully colonize that land does n't mean we share any cultural or historical connection . 
  same about belarus , it was influenced by lithuanians and poles , that 's why there is still polish minority in w. belarus and why it looks similar to lithuania , because bunch of western belarus lands were once inhabited by lithuanians . 
   about cultural/linguistic similarities . 
  most of lithuanians use the very same curse words as russians do : pizdets , blet etc. 
  we also use english , polish even german curse words , those are loanwords , they do not define culture or linguistic trait of a nation . 
   many of lithuanians houses have the thing they call `` domofonas '' which exactly like the ones used in russia . 
  finland has something similar , but it looks pretty diffirent . 
  if lithuania does n't share anything with russia linguistically , why would they use the word `` domofonas '' ? 
  as far as i know lithuanian language has diffirent word for `` house '' . 
  and this thing was incorporated after lithuania re-gained its independence ... you 're first person from who i heard such word . 
  never i have ever seen anyone use `` domofonas '' , the word itself does n't even make sense , i would have no clue what would it mean if someone told me that word . 
   as far as i know russian pop music is relatively popular in lithuania . 
  for me it was weird to see some instagram video by my girlfriend 's friend featuring some russian pop song . 
  this girl does not speak russian and was born closer to mid 90s . 
  you do realize same applies to american , uk pop songs ? 
  russia is not a centre of world when it comes to music , it 's just that it 's 90 's songs were awesome . 
   there is plenty of young people who look like marozai aka gopniks and it 's pretty easy come ucross quite aggressive drunk people in the night who speak lithuanian . 
  never ever i 've experienced something like that in finland ( drunk yes , but never aggressive ) . 
  we should thank for this cultural degradation to soviet union . 
  i hope it gets erased soon . 
  and no , your plenty of young men view is in your own mind because you happen to stumble them a lot during nights . 
  where i live there was only 1 `` marozas '' in my school that kicked half way through high school . 
   also , on not sharing anything linguistically - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages i do n't speak lithuanian but words like dienas , barsukas , groite , zinau , zems etc sound very similar in russian and i highly doubt these are loaned words . 
  might as well connect germanic , romance etc languages because this goes way too deep to a rabbit hole to consider balto-slavs one branch group . 
  i ca n't understand sh * t when i read polish or russian texts , i find easier time on finding similar words on ancient greek and sanskrit texts . 
  even latvian and lithuanian languages are not mutually exclusive . 
   meanwhile estonians do not use russian curse words , despite having larger percentage of russian population , their houses look much nicer and we both know they are doing much better economically . 
  you do realize lithuanian language does not consist any awful curse words ? 
  all our curse words are passive aggressive ( '' \u017e\u0105sine '' - `` goose '' ) , the worst word you can throw to someone is '' \u0161\u016bdo gabalas '' - `` piece of shit '' . 
  that 's why we use loanword curse words . 
   their houses look much nicer and we both know they are doing much better economically . 
  mhm , okay , what makes you think i care ? 
  i 'm happy for them , but i do n't care , as long as we distant ourselves from russia and climb economically i 'm happy . 
   probably thanks to germanic/skandinavian influence and russian influence bring misery , yes i agree , i wish we were occucpied by swedes or germans and not russians . 
   but the thing is that instead of blindly denying the problem it 's much wiser to admit that there is still plenty of things within mentality and culture of major part of lithuanians which need to eliminate .
