   i do n't care if you 're in nato or not . 
  if my country was one of the more powerful nato members , i would question if it was worth it for us . 
  good thing politicians are n't guided by feelings like you . 
  nato is not a special club for certain countries . 
  stable europe and north america is every nato countries priority . 
   what does germany gain from having lithuania in the eurozone ? 
  go study basics of economy . 
  i 'm not bothering . 
   i see you 're really trying to avoid the topic of your contribution to nato by being all gung ho about a past nato military action . 
  what did you contribute to that one ? 
  nato is not some kind of special club . 
  it 's there to protect member states independence against foreign enemy . 
   did you bomb our asses ? 
  we were n't even part of the nato back then . 
  you think usa and other nato countries have no gain of stable europe ? 
  lol ... 
   what does that mean exactly ? 
  ca n't you read ? 
   how do the other members benefit from it ? 
  economically and politically , you think germany would be happy to see lithuania , a eurozone country in war ? 
   what would happen to the us if the region was n't `` stable '' ? 
  nothing . 
  i see you 're really trying to downplay the nato role . 
  and for a good reason , you 're butthurt af for nato bombing your ass . 
  that too . 
  not even our [ commies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antanas_snie%c4%8dkus ) wanted extra russians . 
  stability of the region . 
  thank god we manage to join in time . 
  glory to nato alliance !, 
  do n't forget memelland . 
  just form european fed . 
  and you get two already . 
  we still need you , germany , to create ultimate weapon - german prussia . 
  yeah , i proclaim myself roman emperor , because my last name literally means roman with polish-lithuanian nobility - suffix . 
  cool . 
  low gravity fucks up bone density , muscles are n't the biggest problem . 
   because of dislike and lack of care for lithuania but it 's kind of crazy , lithuanians were one of the most pro-german nations in europe when we gained independence from russian empire . 
  too bad soviet union destroyed east prussia ... those people had a lot of loanwords taken from old prussian and lithuanian vocabularies . 
  could have been bridge for you to learn lithuanian easier . 
  germany is already viewed as `` how country should look like '' by lithuanians . 
  google translate fooled you sadly , yes , you got it wrong . 
  those words say about future of lithuania , as german baltic province . 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  i do n't know what are you trying to say . 
  it 's clear as day why the aoi was in this file group and his nothing with current times . 
  also fanciest military uniforms , lithuanians always get boner from it . 
  there are more countries for it , than against it , and it 's not like we 're going to force someone join federal europe , they 're free to be sovereign nation states , but some of us want to be part of bigger picture . 
  not this time , [ amerikobro ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5703/22413217086_7499d841c4_o.jpg ) has our back . 
  scotland and ireland should make a union , to spite the english people . 
  definetly . 
  can into reich . 
  thank god it is in german archyves . 
  hue . 
  typical for german aristocracy . 
  you do n't know what strategic location is , do you ? 
  people of montenegro are technically serbians , serbia and montenegro is what germany and austria is . 
  * when you accidentally annex belarus * : [ `` whoops , we did it again '' ] ( http://zw.lt/timthumb.php?src=http://zw.lt/assets/fb-sv307570-e1371034031661.jpg&amp;w=344&amp;h=225&amp;f=&amp;zc=2&amp;cc=e3e3e3 ) . 
  i mean , if you 're going to use monthy python , might as well use it on right topics , since you tried to point out that we hate russian empire for no reason . 
  ussr was an imperialist country , end of story . 
  well montenegro is just mountain serbians , but i assume they 're more pro-west as they have no beef with west . 
  well second was taken with google maps , so ... 
  except russian empire is nowhere to roman empire , two very different empires . 
  russian actually degraded our society rather than improved it . 
  attack helicopter car . 
  god knows , actually . 
  maybe it was placed elsewhere . 
  ~ ~ looks like a. smetona ~ ~ , dunno why it 's gone though . 
  edit : [ actual answer . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61zatx/vilnius_lithuania_1787_vs_2012/dfjdsgj/ ), 
  cuz we need gas ? 
  i wonder if there was ever a hostage situation in lithuania ? 
   so i am telling the poles here - go back to vilnius and lviv and give our land back to us . 
   you 're dreaming ; * you were eastern poland * back then ; 1931 polish data showing 30-40 % illiterate east of wilno , 40-55 % south of nowogr\u00f3dek . 
  so what was it like in 19th century ? 
  bruh , what kind of brand weed you smoke with your pot ? 
  is it dmowski \u2122 or pilsudski \u2122 ? 
   you think i am an idiot who can be manipulated into thinking that lithuania and east prussia were one country in 19th century ? 
  yes you 're idiot for not realizing that [ lithuanians ] ( http://i45.tinypic.com/2ppm0k3.jpg ) were present in east prussia . 
  there is a reason why region [ preussisch litauen ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/ma%c5%beoji_lietuva#/media/file:lithuania_minor.png ) existed . 
   i am not going into a further discussion with you but i suggest you apply for a job with breitbart , or if you are fluent in russian , with russian propaganda channels , you seem to have a potential to be great . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  everything i said was about how russian empire was shit for us , how can i be potentially good russian propagandist , are you really that retarded ? 
   almost 100 % could not read or write similar but not on extreme level , [ lithuania minor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_lithuanians#/media/file:wilhelm1.jpg ) was far more educated , since prussians did n't treated lithuanian minority as second class citizens . 
  tsar started degradation process in lithuania , removing [ statutes of lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statutes_of_lithuania ) , replacing with russian law , any polish influence too . 
  here 's list of main things they wanted to remove :  eliminate the polish language from public life  prevent the employment of catholics in government institutions  control and restrict the catholic church  create favorable conditions for the spread of eastern orthodoxy  replace lithuanian parish schools with russian grammar schools  encourage ethnic russians to resettle in lithuanian lands  replace the latin alphabet with the cyrillic alphabet  ban any lithuanian-language publications in the latin alphabet -  could hang them extra-judiciously now that you mentioned it , behold , they [ brought it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky#northwestern_krai_governor_general ) to us and used it to suppress any future resistance . 
  yeah , just in other direction . 
  making lietuva great again !, 
  soon \u2122 you will be ours again < 3, 
  painters perspective might be different than real life photo 's . 
  [ we should just marched from the north . 
  back then it was melting pot . 
  that 's why poland went union with lithuania instead of austria , chicks dig height confirmed !, 
  8 years later polish-lithuanian commonwealth would fall and tsarist cultural oppression would start . 
  not me though . 
  ; / help . 
  ask yourself same , just vice versa . 
  they support status quo that effects their economy . 
  well , he did n't succeed in one thing , having [ lithuania ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarpukario_lietuvos_kariuomen%c4%97#/media/file:lietuvos_kariuomene_1938.army_of_lithuania_in1938.jpg ) as his [ ally ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/ribbentrop-molotov.svg/1052px-ribbentrop-molotov.svg.png ) . 
  before nazis rose to power , lithuania was one of the most germophilic nations in europe for a [ good reason ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian%e2%80%93soviet_war ) and hated france guts out for a [ good reason ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_war#diplomatic_developments ) too . 
  well ...  lithuanians , like most other baltic/scandinavian cultures , have been known for being people of above average height .
