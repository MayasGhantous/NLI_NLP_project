  finns , estonians , latvians , lithuanians , poles , romanians , ukrainians , belarusians all hated tsarist russia . 
  russian empire was great power , not a superpower . 
  besides russians hated their late tsarist era . 
  they 're the ones that ignited the `` civil war '' and are the ones that are training degenerates to fight in combat . 
  i 'm not here to argue , i 'm just saying you 're minority and without any right to influence who will help us and who will not . 
  it 's your right to be a coward , but do n't push it to others , if latvia or poland happen to be attacked i would volunteer instantly , after all after i 'm done with studies i 'm going to volunteer to join the army any way . 
  all i 'm saying without ussr 's existance through cold war , there would be no russian over-ego ` ism . 
  not you alone , all of your people - russians themselves . 
  i 'm talking about our own pro-commie people ( e.g. 
  vincas mickevi\u010dius-kapsukas ) , like mussolini turned from commie to fascist , v. mickevi\u010dius turned from socialist to communist , he was lithuanian nationalist and so were his parents , but years of work against tsarist russia , imprisoment , and meeting commies turned his political view , but he always cared about lithuania being free , i just do n't understand why he fought on the side of russian sfsr , pilsudski 's brother ( one of signators ) was on lithuanian nationalist side , while his brother ( pilsudski ) was on polish . 
  i 'm not talking about whole of russia , but making ussr seize to exist , without ussr russia would never have this notion `` russia stronk '' because ussr 's superpower status is making them want to into past . 
  you 're telling me there are no special russian forces in e. ukraine . 
  lol, 
  i know that . 
  thank god it 's not up to your little brains who will join and who will not . 
   we remain an independent country . 
  oh yes i forgot , latvia wants to annex that half of northern russia . 
  yes . 
  yes ... 
  minsk agreement would n't be needed if russia stayed at it 's own borders . 
  there is no way you can blame ukraine for this . 
  yt was always main source for trolls to express their retardedness . 
  europe needs common european army and a total economical blockage on russia , best case scenario like someone proposed build a lot of lng stations and get boatload of lng carriers ( which lithuanian government actually did to stop from russia black mailing us with higher gas prices if we do n't agree with their bs ) . 
  after 9/11 is clear usa could n't protect it 's citizens any more , it should have been split by canada and mexico in half . 
  oh yeah , russia took over a sovereign nation 's territory , annexed it , what a wonderful friendly country russia is ... russians in the east are insane cowards , they hide in residential areas . 
  thank god our goverment is smart enough to invest in massive stockpile of javelin and self-propelled artillery . 
  thank god there are few russians i know who are going to gtfo from the russian fed . 
  as soon as they finish their studies . 
  since your people done nothing to protect democracy it 's no surprise you 're practically without hands atm . 
  putin has full control over the country just like stalin did . 
  they 're guilty for not being brave enough like millions of their parents who stood up in protesting soviet usage aggresion in baltic states for wanting to secede , it feels so sad that russians are not on our side . 
  i rather prefer to create united european army and end this non-sense , our continent bled enough . 
  iirc those regions are way too economically valuable , same for moldova . 
  dw babe , you 're still our little heart . 
  actually both are right . 
  yours happen first though , but queen wanted to make it sure herself . 
  it only will happen when lithuanian annexes belarus and poland get 's ukraine . 
  yes you do . 
  to us \u0142 is alien letter . 
  oh god , `` good '' old irredentist . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/589cgx/was_medieval_lithuania_actually_the_grand ) start educating yourself . 
  i do n't remember where i read that , but iirc it existed . 
  yes you can , after swedish-commonwealth 's union . 
  this monkeys got rekt by bunch of wildlings at battle of saule , not worthy imo . 
  that 's why we should aid them as much as we can . 
  there is a story that jogaila had to show his `` manly hood '' to under age queen jadviga that he 's a man and not a bear because there were roumors of that , since he was pagan at that time . 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5r6zs4/polishlithuanianukrainian_brigade_reaches_full/dd5g6sz/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ), 
  you did n't understand what i said , sad . 
  i do n't really like to triggered people , i prefer love . 
  like what ? 
  muslims ? 
  arabs ? 
  i 'm not racist , sorry . 
  those poles who do n't assimilate ca n't even speak proper polish any more , they literally mix belarusian , russian and only bits of polish when they speak , plus they 're huge minority , but frankly quite vocal one , with their pro kremlin puppet - waldemar tomasewski . 
  thank you mini-spain . 
  [ finally will be able into nordics !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k%c4%97dainiai ), 
  old church slavonic was adopted as official language , but mainly used only in ruthenian speaking lands , in lithuanians lands , lithuanian language was used , only in cyrilic script , and yes soon polish took over with it 's language and latin script . 
   \u0161e\u0161ios \u017e\u0105sys su \u0161e\u0161iais \u017e\u0105sy\u010diais take that lenkija . 
  if commonwealth 2.0 ever happens , intermarium will for sure happen . 
  we also need latvia . 
  til i 'm not lithuanian . 
  they 're not forced to assimilate . 
  vytis literally means `` to chase '' in lithuanian . 
   though i get it that while using the localized version might as well use vytis one word is slavic , the other is baltic , that 's the reason . 
  the pogon you use is a loanword 100 % , given that old chruch slavonic was used back then before polish language took over it 's no surprised how it appeared . 
  also jogaila was grand duke not prince . 
  overjoyed strange dressing guys ? 
  hmm . 
  [ `` mu\u0160ki '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9x5adywxeo ), 
  probably because we do n't show our `` masks '' or fake smiles . 
  as long as relocation is peaceful . 
  germans taking their blitzkrieg on brazilians . 
  now it makes sense . 
  after first soviet occupation lithuanians also greeted nazi soldiers with flowers even though they annexed part of our pre-war land and threatened us with war . 
  that 's the thing people try to impose modern identities to that of medevial ones . 
   pahonia it 's vytis . 
  pahonia is name of belarusian version of vytis . 
  [ being polish back then = / = being polish now . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ), 
   yup problem is that polish nobles agree , but you have to remember that huge chuck on lithuanian and ruthenian nobility became part of szlachta themselves , so it 's not only polish nobility that should be blamed but also ours for succumb . 
  back then with 200 men you could rekt whole minsk . 
  kaunas and vilnius are 1st and 2nd most populious cities in lithuania , plus they 're huge rivals between each other . 
  your media is over blowing the issue . 
  plus it 's not polish minority that is crying to us , but this kremlin 's cock sucker - [ valdemar toma\u0161evski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valdemar_toma%c5%a1evski ) . 
  would agree any way . 
   do you mean a war where people just go around shouting abuse at/singing songs about each other on a continental scale ? 
  exactly . 
  shiiet ... we have disputed waters with latvia too ... 
  man i wish lithuania was where portugal is . 
  [ meh , nobody can topple russians when it comes to special effects . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqcbp4-c5su ) funny how they use [ jagiellonian dynasty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jagiellonian_dynasty#/media/file:coa_family_pl_jagiellon.svg ) symbol . 
  probably to emulate medieval borders and the symbolic union between poland and lithuania who ruled majority of the lands that are now independent nations . 
  man , football matches is like a warzone for europe , the great mental war will soon break out , i 'm telling you that . 
  filling 'em with welsh sauce . 
  neither was lithuania . 
   i want to thank all baltic people for the strong contribution you played in making the red army win the civil war . 
  you fought bravely for your belief in communism . 
  they fought due to their stupidly on thinking that communism is a good thing . 
  plus all of them hated russia empire that wanted to re-occupy our free countries .
