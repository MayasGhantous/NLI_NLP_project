  no , we choose , not somebody else . 
  might as well do it yourself one time instead of bitching `` it 's west 's fault '' . 
  explains why putin is making the country as backward as possible . 
  neither they would say that they prefer ottomans , what 's your point ? 
  ottoman empire was nothing compare to polish-lithuanian commonwealth when it came to tolerance . 
   poland russia notoriously was/is known as backward empire , especially compare to industrial powerhouse that germany was . 
  problem with ottoman empire and russian empire was that they were too big for what they could chew . 
  hmm , somehow we can relate , i wonder why . 
  yammy australian body . 
  if australia can into [ eurovision ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6qst8qp9ck ) , mexico can into eu . 
  i doubt . 
  poland and lithuania ( us ) is more interesting . 
  there are dozen european countries who were ancient or recent arch enemies , and now we 're all living in fluffy world because we realized that hatred leads to war , and boy war is not something you want to happen on european soil . 
  but you coming too . 
  well i kinda see it , but meh . 
  america is multicultural hub , asian , european , african descendent , all represent america equally . 
   is it just me or does the us look really asian ? 
  like , a chinese top model kinda face why does that matter ? 
  fresh 0/10 troll off the press , boys . 
  besides your version is more awesome . 
   with an extremely low population , a weak economy and cold beaches , it 's just not on the radar for the average german . 
  the only notable thing that happened in lithuania in modern history is the soviet and `` former soviet '' thing . 
  so is austria , economy is recovering insanely fast and our beaches are cold only during winter , we have hot summers you know . 
  besides klaip\u0117da ( more known in german as memel ) is very popular destination for german . 
  lithuania was biggest country as one point , with poland we were great power of europe , sadly both napoleonic and ww1 were spent under other nations , that 's the reason why people forget we existed . 
   i mean , how many lithuanians ( that do not play paradox games ) know about baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ? 
  [ those who know that a guy from w\u00fcrttemberg was suppose to be our king during interwar period . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_lithuania_ ( 1918 \\ ) ), 
  in plc 's case we had both , internal fighting and two empires and a kingdom dismantling us . 
  actually it sad that most of lithuania was n't absorbed by prussia . 
  that state is the reason why our language manage to survive under harsh russian empire ban on lithuanian literature and language . 
  liberum veto is the reason why it was easy to corrupt , not passing good laws would just loath them of noble ' republic further . 
  our mistakes was not keeping quite while we were russian lapdogs , should just waited for few decades more so napoleon era would come . 
  well turkey ( ottoman empire ) did n't recognize partitions of plc , since their enemy was russia at that time . 
  iirc one of the greatest ottoman high ranking officer was polish noble man who converted to islam . 
  plc fall happened because of liberum veto and elected king gradually having as little power as possible as centuries went , which also meant electing weak kings by seimas/seijm . 
  when i see people like him i never take their flairs seriously . 
  people stupidity also comes into this . 
  it was always sick . 
  from argentina to lithuania , to china used same army uniform design as germany during interwar period . 
  [ you miss pronounced memelland . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lietuvininkai_we_are_born ), 
  how can germans not know where baltics are and especially lithuania are ... northern ( baltic ) crusades , battle of grunwald , we with poland transformed to into prussia and set a beginning of state that eventually will unify germany . 
  annexation was illegitimate though . 
  which technically means we still existed as independent nation under foreign occupation . 
  even then swastika itself was never invented or used as hate symbol before , it was very prominent in pagan times and given finnish history their , just like us one of the last pagans of europe .

  nah , i prefer making [ fun of putin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubbasfgnjne ) , he 's just little man who wants to hang out with bigger people . 
  ^ ^ he ^ ^ hates ^ ^ gay ^ ^ like ^ ^ he 's ^ ^ secretly ^ ^ gay ... ^ ^ `` he ^ ^ just ^ ^ wants ^ ^ to ^ ^ sleep ^ ^ with ^ ^ obama . '', 
  yes . 
  union between moldavia and wallachia happened ( forming kingdom of romania ) , while russian empire annexed half of moldova at that time , after ww1 romania manage to get it back , but soon when ussr and hitler made secret pact to divide half of europe , ussr annexed moldova again from romania . 
  there are also two galicia 's . 
  [ we ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galicia_ ( spain \\ ) ) / [ ee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galicia_ ( eastern_europe \\ ) ), 
  for ukraine and it 's people , it 's huge . 
  i guess it 's [ time . 
  you 're giving different answers from my questions . 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
  and yes we do n't share history with romania because it 's on another fucking end of europe , same way france does n't share history with finland . 
  anti putin = / = anti russian, 
  what east west divide ? 
  he had `` troll '' flair long ago and somehow sits with -43 points from me , damn i do n't know why i even bother . 
  what 's the point of this comment and previous comments ? 
  without russia ukraine 's territorial sovereignty would n't been broken , bunch of russian bandits ( `` rebels '' ) would n't be roaming around e. ukraine . 
  both definition and term carries one thing - the meaning of word . 
  but it 's true , they are non-aligned ( technically austria is since it 's part of eu but not nato ) . 
  what 's the point of your comment ? 
  `` oh i point out your country men 's past crimes , that will shut you up about red army crimes ! '' . 
  do you even realize nazi germany was lesser evil than ussr to several countries including mine . 
  exactly , why keep using it ? 
   yeah . 
  it 's much easier to blame the ruskies and the germans than actually make some small effort and realise that the worst crimes during ww2 and during communism , on romanian soil , were caused by romanians . 
  asking any old people in ex soviet occupied countries and you will realize what kind of horrors they committed if you did n't kept quite . 
  this was done by first soviet occupation , before even nazis crossed our border :   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  sadly they ca n't because russia is clingy leech . 
  switzerland and austria are third world countries ... 
  always . 
  people wanted closer ties to eu which the puppet promised but at the last day refused which made people furious , not surprising , seeing how far more successful poland is even though ukraine started with higher gdp after fall of ussr , allying with east is death sentence to ever evolving into modern european state . 
  is that all the butt hurt you can spill ? 
  well poles [ tried ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) but failed because of their own arrogance . 
   it would be really nice for us all to have learned from it . 
  poles learned from it , as also we did , that 's why we both gone into nato and eu , while keeping friendly relations . 
  yeah , i know how insanely ukraine was divided back then , which probably the reason why you did n't succeed for independence , polish giving up territories they actually gained through war did n't help either , especially when they betrayed belarus and annexed half of it to themselves while selling the other half to soviets . 
   problems with manpower since the beginning of our short-lived independence . 
  [ which why as i said , we got saxon help . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ), 
  yes you 're right , those allied troops should in the baltics now . 
   trust me , you were luckier . 
  we were n't luckier , we just resisted more than you . 
  this is so ridiculous , russia invaded far more times than it was ever invaded . 
  leg fetish best fetish . 
  the serbians themselves killed local population . 
  it 's fresh acc , who just claimed he 's anti eu and pro russian , which says that he 's most likely a shill . 
  truly a mini russia . 
   so you believe minorities can unilaterally declare independence ? 
  if that 's what majority of minority wants , yes . 
   territorial integrity of the federal republic of yugoslavia here is your problem , serbia was not yugoslavia at that moment . 
  and it is kosovars who declared independence , all we did was making sure you do n't go rampage mode on them .
