  that 's what i 'm saying , they can send these kind of trains around their serbian borders , do n't send it elsewhere , especially to people that hate you , that `` kosovo is serbia '' train just makes no sense . 
  we do n't bash russians , we bash their government . 
  i do n't know where people get this connotation that we hate russians , it 's their leaders that are threat to us , not their people . 
  it was dark sarcasm , i would never mean it . 
  i would n't say luckier ones , we had to fight poles , reds , bermotians ( rogue german/russian army ) . 
  the thing is that we got huge help from saxons ( germans ) given our historical ties , which poland sadly did n't live up on promise to help you . 
  i know about slav migration to balkans dw . 
  but that still stroke it too close to the hearth imo . 
  but i guess that 's the only way to shut up those serbian ultra-nationalists . 
  kosovo is not serbian yard . 
  yes please , because even then , it 's up to kosovars to independent or not . 
   and serbia signed no treaties on the subject . 
  when serbia pulled out the military , it was promised territorial integrity . 
  words are meaningless . 
  i 'd like source on that too . 
  because we feel bad on serbian butthurt . 
  that 's really xenophobic comment man , even for me , that 's insanely cold . 
  actually neither greco nor roman , there were already indo-european tribes living there . 
  so taking revenge is acceptable ? 
  should we also start lining up all the remaining poles in vilnius region ? 
  there is line on freedom of speech . 
  you can scream like an angry dog in your yard , do not scream in neighbours yard . 
  well that 's their problem . 
  because that 's not what officials should do . 
  this thing is meaningless and just furthers the distance for normal relations between two . 
  hungarians might as well too start writing and sending trains to vojvodina `` reverse treaty of trianon , northern serbia is hungarian clay '' . 
  the form on how they exhibit is childish . 
  lol, 
  you surely do n't know how eu works , do you ? 
  hi southern lithuania !, 
  newly cooked acc off the press just to comment on this thread to say something bad about poland . 
  talking about bravery . 
  communism would still inflict huge damage to economy . 
   tens of millions of people which still [ happened ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_european_anti-communist_insurgencies ) during ussr 's rule , it was murderous oppressive dictatorship that ethnically cleansed poles and germans . 
  you do know eu is not just france and britain ? 
  the demise of soviet union was gorbachev 's reforms on trying to modernize a dictatorship into democracy , which was built on blood and held by iron fist , losing the grip only meant states finally getting their chance to escape what we called `` prison of nations '' . 
  let hope it will last for longer than we expect . 
  i 'm pretty sure countries would n't ally themselves with nazi germany if it was n't for ussr 's murderous dictatorship that killed millions of it 's and other country 's citizens in most brutal fashion from starving to straight torturing , here is a glimpse on what they did in lithuanian during first occupation , before even nazis crossed the border and were seen as liberators . 
   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
   when you add in that many people in these countries still remeber being ruled by the soviet union as essentially a foreign occupying empire no wounder they are n't exactly russophiles . 
  123 years under russian empire were n't sweet either . 
  [ germany . 
  no we 're not cute , [ we 're dark , brutal and filled with hatred !, 
  ) \\ we need a [ helmet ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yodgg6z.png ) not a bow . 
  it was nobles ' republic , it was everyones country whoever lived within it , from poles , to germans , to lithuanians , to jews , to tatars ( muslims ) , to ruthenians ( belarusians , ukrainians ) . 
  well , you were part of commonwealth back then , embrace the magic of ethnicity infusion [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) ;[ [ 2 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_lithuanians ) . 
  the bad things out-weights the good things . 
  people either do n't know or ignore all the bad things , making ussr look like a wonderland nation , while in practice it was murderous prison of nations . 
   purity is usless if you ca n't say yes like a normal person . 
  we have two words for `` yes '' , it 's `` taip '' and `` jo '' . 
   assimilate into the latvian conscisousness . 
  sorry we 're [ conquers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jqso1e0.jpg ) , not [ colonizers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_courland_and_semigallia#colonization ) . 
   your beer will become ours . 
  well we can already share . 
  ;p  our ethnic problems will become yours . 
  we 're good at removing that problem . 
  and russia has n't stopped attacking european countries for past 700 years . 
  nato stopping serbian/kosovar genocide between each other is somehow worse than russians protecting criminals who ran over un-armed lithuanians during january events . 
  old prussian  lithuanian  void  latvian when it comes to archaic purity of the baltic languages . 
  you better wash your tongue with soap before talking , youngling . 
  yep , nordic banks are great investors in baltic countries . 
  soviets inflicted so many atrocities , i do n't understand how can some people see ussr in nice light . 
  you poor americans . 
  all the mcdonalds , but no yammy european cuisine . 
  well vilnius was and still is the most multi-cultural/multi-ethnic city in lithuania through history . 
  and since he showed most of the worst parts of the city it 's not surprise , the euromonies are put to improve looking of buildings really does change perspective . 
  you can always brew one yourself . 
  being part of eu , nato , eurozone pretty much ensures our safety , does n't mean we 're not preparing for possible invasion , which we - lithuanians do . 
  not doing same mistake we did in ww2 , by being strictly neutral , not prepared correctly for armed battle and giving up to everyone 's ultimatum . 
  clearly american troops are [ oppressing ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5703/22413217086_7499d841c4_o.jpg ) lithuanians , while russians [ protected ] ( http://gdb.rferl.org/33ac9b59-0b34-469d-9d7d-bb599ec86b71_cx0_cy4_cw0_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg ) us from those fascist invaders !, 
  our government is 10x better , people have nothing to do with it . 
  polish and lithuanian army was still separate thing in commonwealth , polish troops occupied moscow , not ours , were pre-occupied with polish -- swedish war ( 1600 -- 11 ) . 
  probably bullet crossed the cheek , knowing that some soldiers were un-professionals from central asia . 
  we hate russian government , not people . 
  lithuania doing same with buying out german self-propelled artillery weapons . 
  ~ 80 % of casualties caused in the great war ( ww1 ) were by artillery . 
  2x more pop than poland , ~ 17x than baltic , was n't raped by communism , no shit sherlock . 
  take a joke instead of making serious stuff out of it . 
  all of us are nato members , war between us is impossible . 
  winged hussars are not specific to poland . 
  after all lithuania has african colours . 
  we got more than enough boats from refugees . 
  not this time kebab , [ christian angels ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6zdhdbp.jpg ) coming your way !, 
  til my friend who studies in moscow to be lawyer is somehow as criminal ? 
  3 months barely any up-votes . 
  clearly not an `` wannabe troll '' teenage . 
  that 's belarusian version of vytis . 
  oh yeah ... clearly russia is innocent , it definitely is not sheltering soviet troops that rolled over un-armed lithuanians with tanks . 
  just get that [ balto-german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) mix in and you get the prussian blood line rolling through european continent again . 
  oh yeah , [ serbia innocent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq_j2c6hrz0 ) in all wars they have been to . 
  i forgot , my bad . 
  you thinking about russians , we 're thinking about soviets . 
   i did n't criticize yours i asked a genuine question - why is it so african looking and why not use your historic . 
  because old flag had way too much red colour in it as it could we be seen as `` commie '' looking flag , we tried to distance ourselves as far as possible from soviets since they were one of our many [ enemies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) , considering this flag was used by independence fighters it would be an insult to stop using it , plus we did n't want to re-create multi-cultural , multi-religious [ grand duchy of lithuania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7ucvjpa.png ) which poland hoped to revive since they wanted to re-create [ polish-lithuanian commonwealth ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pvwquor.png ) while we sought for a [ national state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_lithuania_ ( 1918 \\ ) ) even if it meant taking germanized western and polonized eastern lithuanians , and lithuanians only , no belarusians . 
  there were few other flags , including [ germophilic lithuanians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_lithuanians#/media/file:wilhelm1.jpg ) who wanted [ lithuanian minor ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/ma\u017eoji_lietuva#/media/file:flag_of_lithuania_minor.svg ) flag . 
  tri color was chosen because red and green were primary colours of lithuanian folk lore ( even today you can see lithuanian influence on belarusians as they also use red , green in their flag ) , yellow was chosen for represent more colourful approach and you pretty much get view of lithuanian history , yellow beautiful dusk , green sacred pagan forests and red spilled blood of invading forces . 
  back in the interwar nobody thought that it will represent or even will be looked upon as some kind african colour after all africa were still colonies at that time . 
  - i 'm more than anything for vytis ' flag , but i do n't see anything wrong with tri-colour it inspires as much patriotism to me as vytis ' flag . 
  all i can think of is that one day horde of [ welsh dragons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq4y7ztznkc ) will descend over european continent to get their revenge for englishmen rule . 
  criticising my flag , why ca n't i do the same ?
