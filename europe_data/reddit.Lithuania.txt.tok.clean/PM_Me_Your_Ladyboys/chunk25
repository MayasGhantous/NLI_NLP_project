  come here little danija , got many snow . 
  well you can always travel . 
  just cross the baltic , loads of snow here . 
   temperatures are expected to go as low as 5\u00bac , im scared . 
  you did n't catch it ... 
  good look with all the kebabs there . 
  your flag has less joy than ours . 
  it 's our coat of arms now . 
  because western europe did n't knew about it back then , that 's why it is named as `` invisible front '' . 
  if you 're into young teens ... 
  make prussia out of us ? 
  pls . 
  we got baltic blood , you got german discipline , make reich great again !, 
  after all our standardised lithuanian language is half auk\u0161taitian dialect half prussian-lithuanian . 
   there is many historical works on that theme , belarusian historians claim that belarusians created grand duchy of lithuania jesus , what next , belarusians are true romans . 
  meh dw , 50 years and british women will become attractive again from those superior e. euro genes . 
  that still over takes n. europe by wide margin . 
  that still overcomes us insanely . 
  baby steps . 
   they just split up europe in groups with a ** comparable amount of people ** , so you end up with the ** uk ** in northern europe as well . 
  dude what ? 
  - uk : 65,110,000 sweden : 9,954,420 ireland : 6,378,000 norway : 5,252,166 denmark : 5,707,251 lithuania : 2,853,500 latvia : 1,957,200 estonia : 1,315,944 iceland : 332,529, 
  what ? 
  how ? 
  ( as i said union with sweden seized to exist and was completely nullified ) we have no swedish influence that could be seen here . 
   in april 1919 , poland captured vilnius and came in contact with the lithuanian army fighting in the lithuanian -- soviet war . 
   in july 1920 , poland was losing the polish -- soviet war and was in full retreat . 
  the lithuanians followed retreating polish troops to secure the territory , assigned to lithuania by the soviet -- lithuanian peace treaty . 
  the soviets were the first to enter vilnius . 
  when poland achieved a major victory in the battle of warsaw and forced the soviets to retreat in august 1920 , lithuanians defended their new borders . 
  poland did not recognize the peace treaty and claimed that lithuania had become a soviet ally . 
  fighting broke out in the suwa\u0142ki region . 
  during the battle of the niemen river , poland attacked lithuania on a wide front . 
  the battle drastically altered the military situation and left vilnius open to an attack . 
  under pressure from the league of nations , poland signed the suwa\u0142ki agreement on october 7 , 1920 . 
  the agreement drew a new demarcation line , which was incomplete and did not provide protection to vilnius . 
  livonia ( estonia and latvia ) has more german influence , than swedish or danish , though some parts of it were under their respective kingdoms . 
  lithuania never fell under direct swedish or danish rule , the closest thing that came is [ union of k\u0117dainiai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) which was broken soon before it could even be legitimate . 
  lithuania has least nordic influence , our culture is closest to polish and german . 
  since they were most influential neighbours in middle ages till modern times . 
  thank god it was stopped . 
  under german occupation city belonged to us and our government was working from vilnius region . 
  which is exactly what i said ... 
  a mess ? 
  finland was baltic before ww2 , now it 's nordic , it 's not about geography but economical and social status . 
  we 're not nordic for now , that 's for sure , but we have a chance to become one , after all baltics and federal state of germany that was at danish/swedish possession at some time have observer status in nordic council . 
  nordic countries are biggest partners here , we 're working with them most than with any other neighbouring country . 
  nordic is arguable , very arguable , at least for now , but baltics being northern europe is the right way to go and call . 
  we have neither cultural nor political similarities with russia , ukraine or belarus which are bulwark of e. europe . 
  we can go further into history , polish-lithuanian commonwealth would often be referred in western chronicles as just kingdom of poland . 
  german settlers took the name prussia from native baltic tribe that inhabited the land before northern crusades . 
  so prussians were n't always known as germans . 
  but we 're small and punny , it 's clear we were always occupied , right ? 
   so it was rather a latin alphabet ban , is n't it ? 
  [ hah , you wish . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky#northwestern_krai_governor_general )  eliminate the polish language from public life  prevent the employment of catholics in government institutions  control and restrict the catholic church  create favorable conditions for the spread of eastern orthodoxy  replace lithuanian parish schools with russian grammar schools  encourage ethnic russians to resettle in lithuanian lands  replace the latin alphabet with the cyrillic alphabet  ban any lithuanian-language publications in the latin alphabet, 
  we held vilnius region , after soviets started invasion they took the region and then poles pushed them back they took vilnius region with them . 
  that 's how polish-lithuanian war was sparked . 
  republic of lithuania . 
  finland , latvia , estonia , just to name few . 
  kingdom of lithuania was smaller baltic based state , while gdl went full ham on ruthenians , mongols and teutonics . 
  the word means `` ten thousand years '' so - `` de\u0161imt t\u016bkstan\u010di\u0173 met\u0173 '' . 
  we will go full japan on war mode . 
  jesus , ca n't you grasp the metaphor ? 
  why take everything so serious . 
   well hitler had already given you to the soviets by then anyway ( as in agreed they could have lithuania not that it was already occupied ) . 
  you do realize he offered alliance and attack on poland before soviet invasion of 1940 ? 
  he would n't have given us to soviets , because he assigned us into his sphere of influence , given that we were economically dependent on nazi germany after they took klaip\u0117da region from us . 
  no shit sherlock , thanks for finding out the most well known fact in both countries . 
  technically we already are , just without monarch . 
  the old kingdom of lithuania has it 's core borders . 
  i 'm not talking about 1918 kingdom . 
  and we just wanted to revive kingdom of lithuania . 
  you do realize canada , usa and mexico are land connected ? 
  while isles are not ? 
  great britain is england , scotland and wales , it 's british isle . 
  you do n't call ireland lesser britain . 
  [ uk atm . 
  ] ( https://i1.wp.com/starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/uk-brexit-cat-wanting-to-go-out-no-longer-wants-to-go-out-once-door-is-open-gif-animation-simons-cat-fail.gif ), 
  agree . 
  prior to that poland anschlussed vilnius when we were busy fighting off soviets . 
  prior to polish invasion hitler also wanted lithuania to invade poland from the north to reclaim our lost historical capital . 
  we refused even though taking vilnius back was our priority . 
  what about vilnius region ? 
  that was real dick move . 
  123 years [ under ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a6u4rgb.jpg ) russian empire and poof , poland wants our capital . 
  good ol' pagan times , when we raided poland . 
  saved them trouble from becoming part of southern bavarians . 
  western prussia was most of what is eastern germany . 
  yes . 
  would make more sense . 
   meanwhile generalbezirk litauen was not a state . 
  it was an occupied territory under military control . 
  lssr was same thing . 
  there are no ties outside of it being part of gdl for couple of centuries . 
   the state did not dissolve . 
  todays lithuanian republic is a direct continuation of yesterdays lssr , even though the new state has a different constitution . 
  we do n't use different constitution we use pre-1940 's one . 
   if the lithuanian one doesn \u00b4 t include it , its false . 
  the supreme council of the republic of lithuania that initiated the independence was the supreme soviet of the lssr , just renamed .
