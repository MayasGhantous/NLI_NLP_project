  and after that lssr seized to exist while independence was re-established . 
   as i said , technically , its right . 
  the lithuanian republic is the legal continuation of the lssr just like the federal republic of germany is the legal continuation of the german reich . 
  i can understand that the baltics don \u00b4 t like it , but it is technically right . 
  except german reich and federal republic of germany is one and same , non occupied german nation , while lssr should be compared to that of generalbezirk litauen . 
  call lenkija , we need to make a deal . 
  lssr was legal body within ussr only . 
  beside it 's english version that includes that lssr declared independence , not lithuanian one . 
   only it is not the belarus nation that influenced lithuania  denying belarus influence in favor of polish one make up your mind . 
  no shit , criminals/ultranationalists are from common people circle well what would you know , any way the order was given by the nazis . 
  we 're not talking what could happen , but what happened . 
  other than vilnius region we got all the pre-ww2 borders . 
  besides germany and ussr supported us on vilnius dispute , it was complicated any way . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) * i got shot with the sweetest gun * * never mind what i have become * * why should i love when i can have fun * * with my breathing toy * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   when vilno would be delivered to poland ? 
  because poland refused to take any territorial claims . 
   ah right !, 
  you 're completely un educated in this matter at all . 
    on 28 september 1992 the foreign ministers of both nations signed a declaration of friendship and neighborly relations and a consular convention , rejecting any territorial claims and promising to respect the rights of their corresponding minorities -  we know our history . 
  do n't need sugar coat nome of it . 
  so why use it on us ? 
  we were not legal parts of ussr , our land was occupied by foreign power . 
  except poland actually culturally influenced us during christianization , while the only lithuanians that were influenced by ruthenians culture were the ones that were landlords . 
  well , we still have fetishes . 
   that does n't negate the fact that you were on fact incorporated into the su . 
  so was most countries within other countries , should i know refer to portugal as former caliphate ? 
  the article says it all already . 
   the letter also notes that the baltic states did not create themselves from scratch in 1990s after the collapse of the soviet union but restored their independence that had been severed by the soviet rule , thus declaring continuity of their statehood . 
  therefore , the baltic states are not successors of the soviet union 's statehood and rights , therefore , can not be politically defined as former soviet republics . 
  fraction does n't make us similar in any way . 
  i 'm not justifying actions done by criminals/utlra-nationalists and other delusional freaks who came from lithuania and started to kill off jewish population who were known as - '' \u017eyd\u0161aud\u017eiai '' , i 'm justifying why common population did n't care . 
  still , inter war lithuania should have went to war , as we did had the equipment , high , well educated officers , commanders etc , but small army , our disadvantage was numbers , but we could have just hold off , and issued international recognition that ussr is as much aggressor as nazi germany is . 
   i don \u00b4 t think it is hard where this comes from : before the baltics declared their independence that 's the thing . 
  we did n't declared independence , we [ re-established ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/act_of_the_re-establishment_of_the_state_of_lithuania ) it . 
   the act emphasized restoration and legal continuity of the interwar-period lithuania , which was occupied by the ussr and lost independence in june 1940 . 
  since when does year joining eu define country 's geography ? 
  few things do n't make us identical . 
  we have with poland , with belarus and russia we have only fraction . 
   food this comes from medieval times e.g. 
  belarusian pancakes and olivier salad , unless you want to list more ? 
   metaphors/sayings . 
  only older generation , the younger 's at most use only curse words , but then again , we use also polish/english ones . 
   drinking til germany is culturally same as russia . 
   loanwords til we 're culturally same as england/usa because we have buttload of it loanwords . 
  even then , that does n't make countries culturally similar , otherwise england and italy are same because a huge portion of english words come from latin language . 
   the soviet republic in 1920 had a different view than the one 1939 regarding the validity of your independence . 
  but you know that , or at least should , assuming you were taught half-decently at your various history classes throught the years . 
  we know very well that they wanted to conquer whole of europe . 
  does n't change the fact that we had a treaty in which they recognized us as independent nation and refused any territorial claims . 
   was the occupation ilegal ? 
  it was illegal . 
   how did you take such assumptions from my replies i ca n't understand , but guess that what 's happen when you discuss most things with most users from the balts in this subreddit . 
  you should say people from the baltic region , not balts . 
  balts ( latvians , lithuanians ) are exclusive branch of indo-european group that does n't include estonians , who are n't even part of indo-european group . 
   i can only laught at this , really . 
  guess that from 1945 through 1990/1/2 there was a void in the present-day lithuanian territory . 
  no , we were illegally occupied by foreign power , that imposed it 's laws , administration etc. 
  it created it 's own mini world bubble - commie bloc . 
  examples please . 
   i mean , it 's also that they were insanely antisemitic and started murdering jews the second germans set a foot in lithuania . 
  before losing our independence in 1795 grand duchy of lithuania and polish-lithuania commonwealth were safest places in europe for both [ muslims ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars ) and [ jews ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/lietuvos_\u017eydai ) . 
  after regaining independence we wanted to create nation that was biased on lithuanian [ ethnographic regions ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/etnoregionai.png ) with our historical capital - vilnius . 
  xix c. made south western lithuania heavily germanized while south eastern lithuania was heavily polonized due to german and russian empire policies on minorities , though germans were more soft which helped our language to survive in parts that were occupied by russian empire . 
  long story short our capital in +70 years became majority polish , with jews being second biggest group , we were minority . 
  jews supported poles on vilnius dispute which was just a spark on anti-semitism . 
  but when jews also welcomed soviet army into lithuania and well you know above what soviets did , lithuanians quickly were affected by nazi propaganda , due to also that hitler had initial plans to make lithuania an ally state and to do joint attack on poland which we refused . 
  even from his own delusional mind we could be considered part of his `` master race '' as he said himself from his own mouth while regarding baltic states . 
  tl ; dr jews supported both poles and soviets which fuelled anti-semitism that did n't exist before . 
  just because it does n't exist it does n't mean you do n't white wash their history , i seen you doing it not long ago . 
  and well what would you know , a guy that defends russian invasion and annexation of crimea and supporting russian rebels in e. ukraine is a pro-russian . 
  i knew that long ago i just wanted to hear it from your own mouth . 
  then give me examples . 
  exactly . 
  the suicides are happening because of alcohol which is a relic from russian empire times . 
   the ussr viewed your independence has ilegitimed . 
  [ what ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet\u2013lithuanian_peace_treaty ) they recognized our independence 20 years prior to first occupation . 
   made an agreement with an another `` empire '' to reconquer the baltic territories and then proceed to do it so it 's okay , they have every legal right to occupy us ? 
  you can do agreement with spain and morocco to split portugal , will that be legal in your world ? 
   victorious and had effective control of the balts for 50 years . 
  why do n't we call ireland , as `` former british possession '' too then ? 
  they 're as young nation as us are . 
   but in fact you were part of the ussr . 
  yes we were , illegally occupied and held by them . 
   lithuanians participated in the military after ww2 [ lithuanian partisans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yecpcorupym ) fought for 9 years the soviet army instead of joining it , as so did half of europe that fell under soviet onslaught . 
  after every single soldier was destroyed by soviets , those that were born in soviet infested propaganda joined soviets as they were told lies into their ears . 
   at the central soviet ahahaha , what next , everyone was equal in ussr ? 
  everyone were ruled from moscow . 
   represented the ussr at the olympics sports do not interfere with politics , but then again , when soviets won medal and commentators said for congratulation russians with their victory lithuanians left the arena without taking their prizes . 
  you 're really uneducated if you think [ our athletes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vleyzy_had8 ) were happy under soviets . 
   if you were n't soviet republics then basically only russia were one i guess . 
  lssr was , not republic of lithuania . 
   make your revisionist claims all you want . 
  or stop white washing soviet occupation as it was nice and dandy . 
  i mean being called ex-soviet republic literally insult [ your own people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) who died protecting democratic , capitalistic lithuania , as also our partisans who resisted for 9 years in hopes that americans will free us from red terror . 
  while west 's war ended in 45 's , ours ended in 90 's . 
  lssr = / = republic of lithuania . 
   ` lithuania was soviet so it is justified that they 're not happy and have the highest suicide rate in the world , it is justified that their economy is unstable and they rely heavily on other eu countries ' the unhappiness is exaggeration , the suicide rates are inflated because of very low population and holy shit our economy is stable and already above greek one , unlike you we 're not hiding our economic stability lol , every single european country relies on other eu countries you know why ? 
  because single market . 
   it 's not my fault that the world is harsh , people .
