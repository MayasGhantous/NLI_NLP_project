  personally i do n't even use the term `` former soviet republic of lithuania '' or whatever . 
  it 's not harsh , it 's just uneducated and using term ex-soviet state as much as russians call everyone fascist whoever disagrees with their politics . 
  but after all you 're pro-ussr/putin 's authoritarian regime , are n't you ? 
  because it 's used as old fashioned political term , not as geographical one , we 're as much northern as denmark , even more than that , and far less eastern than finland or greece . 
  the term should n't apply to us . 
  even then our cultures have nothing similar with russians , belarusians , or ukrainians . 
  i do n't , it 's just simple non sense which was fallowed by your non sense . 
  do n't worry , i can catch sarcasm very well . 
  oh sure , give me a break , soviets would have invaded finland either way , after all they shelled their own troops to justify actions against finland . 
  alright mate , former spanish territory of portugal . 
  after all their king was also legally your king . 
  of course you 're not a nationalist , you 're die hard russian/soviet apologist that would love to lick stalin 's boot if he could before being sent to gulag . 
  you do realize soviets installed their pro commie puppets after take over of our countries , which issued latter to join ussr ? 
  after ww2 lithuanians and all of e. europe were stuck in partisan war against ussr rule for next 9 ~ years , lithuanian partisan war was specifically most brutal in the region . 
  soviets would torture first before disposing you . 
  they were the only ones that did n't want dissolution of ussr . 
   their culture reflects this period even today examples ? 
  why the fuck writing that we 're an ex-soviet republic matter in the first place ? 
  it 's not like we ran or did anything in ussr , we were occupied territory that was enslaved . 
  you do realize ussr send army , ditched our government , killed them in forests , installed their commie puppets which issued a latter to join ussr ? 
  what do you call it ? 
  will of the people ? 
  legitimate occupation and annexation ? 
  may i ask why the fuck soviet label matter in the first place ? 
  here is simplified version on how ussr occupied us . 
  after hitler gave ultimatum to give up klaip\u0117da region and after we refused to make an alliance and joint attack on poland to regain vilnius , germans pretty much lost any faith on seeing us on their side . 
  year later soviets gave their ultimatum to either let install few military bases with non-specified number of soldiers or be invaded , it was n't hard to choose because lithuanian army was filled with high command officers but what we lacked was lower rank soldiers , we did n't had the numbers to even stall the soviets and germany was already on our bad list as we were on theirs , so we choose strict neutrality and accepted the ultimatum , after that our authoritarian president who did n't want to kneel on soviet demands left the country as our legitimate government kept working , but they soon started to get ditched one by one by soviets and new pro-commie puppets started to appear , soon they replaced everyone , because of rigged elections , while they murdered any political opponent in most brutal fashion . 
   [ the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive. , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainiai_massacre ) after that they pretty much had control of the country and just issued paper to join ussr and well hell has started for our people before even nazis set foot to the point that nazis were seen as liberators . 
  they apologized for it on official level and now are one of the biggest investors in our countries . 
  give territories back to finland too . 
  you do realize we did n't join ? 
  we only accepted their bases to be on our soil , after that was ratified and their army was coming unopposed they soon ditched everyone from our legitimate government while our president fled to west and later usa , just to be burned alive in his own house by soviets spies . 
  while soviets installed their pro-commie boot lickers and those asked to join ussr . 
   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  there is a reason lithuanians greeted nazis as liberators ... let 's not even begin what they done with second occupation . 
  half of poland was ethnically cleansed , half of germany was ethnically cleansed , deportations , 2 million women got raped by red army , they raped even female pow ... 
  even in the 90 's soviets did n't change , january events shows that very well , using tanks to crush un armed civilians . 
  former * people 's * republic of china you know , your government for sure makes it look like . 
  yeah i know that . 
  but still the point stands that we wanted to distance ourselves from poles as further as we could . 
  there are neither evidence nor facts about such agreement for `` no east ward expansion '' . 
   said agreement not to expand east ward in nato this is a myth , there was no such agreement . 
  besides it 's not up to russia which countries want to join nato . 
  then write it to mods instead of bitching it to me . 
  i mean geographical sub-divisions of ru fed . 
  specifically . 
  if you posted something from russian poetry , nature anything , that would be interesting . 
  the sub-divisions of ru fed . 
  do n't really matter since it 's only federation in name . 
  plus it shows russian occupied crimea . 
  that 's because he was [ polish-lithuanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) ( not in modern sense , rather that of british/roman etc. 
  well ... lithuania makes more sense to be rohan , since it was north of gondor . 
  we have similar flags [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/d/de/rohan.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20110313203419 ) -  [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_lithuania#/media/file:lithuanian_coat_of_arms_vytis._16th_century.jpg ) . 
  plus [ battle of kircholm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ) is like real life version of [ ride of the rohirrim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emtz7eaylrs#t=3m30s ) given the ratio between the armies and tactic they used ( charging from the hill while shouting \u201e mu\u0161ki ! `` - `` attack '' , inducing fear ) . 
  we borrowed your alphabet to spite the poles . 
  but we 're known to be good at basketball . 
  except germans , because germans are cool . 
  lithuanians mostly go for exotic and warm places e.g. 
  thailand , greece , spain , turkey , egypt . 
  map you showed on this thread covers more than it should be , [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xzyc6vu.jpg ) is a map comparing modern lithuania and old grand duchy of lithuania . 
  it has something to do with [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) . 
  the moment nazis rose to power we started prosecuting every single one of them during last 5 years before beginning of ww2 . 
  that 's one of the reasons why hitler gave up on achieving lithuania as an ally ( they took klaip\u0117da region from us and we refused to do a joint attack on poland from the north to regain vilnius region which we sought hard to recover ) and just sold us out to soviet sphere of influence for parts of poland . 
  k , time to conquer gudija . 
  our blood is closer to finns and estonians than to poles or russians . 
  check genetic make up , not history . 
  i agree with you , modern commie lovers are straight dumb . 
  excuse me ? 
  there were talks about join lithuanian-latvian state after regaining independence in 1918 but it was n't that much popular , polish-lithuanian war did n't help either . 
  china is far from communist , it 's more of hyper-capitalist dictatorship . 
  we 're all part of n. europe , that for sure , we might join nordic club one day , but scandinavia is purely a region that is norway , sweden and denmark . 
  pls let us into [ nordic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_council#members ) , we have been waiting forever . 
  the victory was unworthy and they failed their actual task - conquering whole of finland . 
  the soviet army itself was inexperienced after stalin purge , but it 's actually good that he did that , at least finns did n't get their freedom taken away . 
  pls protect us . 
  * split them into small divisions * * rip 'em of the conquest visions * * motti tactics used with great result * - * snipers move unseen in snowfall * * force them to retreat and recall * * fight the russian rule and their demand * - * with molotov cocktail in hand * * no fear of their tanks * * death or glory * - * rise , nations pride * * hold what 's yours * * strike 'em were it hurts * - * fight , hold your ground * * winter war * * reinforce the line * * [ sabaton - talvisota ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn-fifcnwbm ), 
  well we live next to each other and we 're small as hell , getting same weather is nothing to be surprised . 
  when you nod up and down for saying no and left and right for sayings yes . 
  * scratches head *, 
  yay eternal winter !, 
  what said its truth , but you might right , the person might need mental help . 
  i mean , lithuanian ulta nationalist will just talk about lithuania , he does n't care about poland , belarus let alone russia . 
  while polish ulta nationalist spit how great their country was , muh hussaria which over shadows [ lithuanian hussars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ) , poland is always white , never black . 
  i 'm perfectly fine with poles , i have many of them as good friends , but sometimes when i go through sub-reddits , i see so many `` modern lithuania is just samogitia '' ; `` modern lithuania is artificial nation , schizophrenic province of poland '' bs . 
  why you do this ? 
  you broke the [ nobles ' republic ] ( https://i.sli.mg/lwvwme.gif ) circle jerk . 
  that person just has anger issues , that 's all . 
  this guy , literally pm 'd me quote * `` go kill yourself '' * . 
  well we were last state in europe to adopt christianity . 
  and after that most of the nobles still kept being pagans even today we still have pagans . 
  that 's why we got poles on our side , they infiltrated all the strategic toilets , prepare for the original [ commonwealth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_commonwealth ) to kick your frencho-germanic ass . . 
  depends on a language , for lithuanians it 's easy to spell . 
  why is that ? 
  both ussr and tsarist russia were forcibly trying to russify the lands . 
  for us russia is same turks are for greeks . 
  must . 
  conquer . 
  must . 
  raid .
