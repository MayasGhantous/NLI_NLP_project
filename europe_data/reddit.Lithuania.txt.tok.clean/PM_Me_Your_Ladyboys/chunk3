  at the end of the 19th century , the average height of males was 163.5 cm ( 5 ft 4 in ) and the average height of females was 153.3 cm ( 5 ft 0 in ) . 
  by the end of the 20th century , heights averaged 181.3 cm ( 5 ft 11 in ) for males and 167.5 cm ( 5 ft 6 in ) for females . 
  one of the reasons why hitler invaded several countries , he wanted germany to become self sufficient country , literally a megapower of the world . 
  [ j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) vs [ roman dmowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_dmowski#/media/file:liniadmowskiego.png ), 
  that 's why usa protects it 's allies with whom it has treaties , ukraine was pro-russian state who turned west after realizing how shit it 's to be part of eastern sphere . 
  because it 's mutually good ? 
  for europe it 's `` visa exemption when arriving at and departing from minsk national airport '' . 
  same in lithuania , not even google can find it . 
  sadly current usa 's president and his put-in-the-post officials do not want united europe . 
  someone should force trump to listen to [ ode to joy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ) until he friggin ' loves it . 
   to suggest it 's by and away the reason the world has stayed large-scale conflict-free since the us came into power is intellectually dishonest . 
  kinda is true , europe was always a spark where fire went to all continents . 
  shitty borders after decolonization are the reason why some mena countries are in war . 
  i wish romania had it 's own `` nordics '' , they 're huge reason why we 're doing so good . 
  flexing muscle will only make gorillas mad . 
   the iron curtain has fallen - the usa and russia trade . 
  you always this stupid or this is because of full moon ? 
   for the guy using many british inventions just say that usa itself is a british invention . 
   a united europe was key to keeping y' all from killing eachother but does n't do much as a deterrent outside that sphere . 
  because there is still one nation that prefers a disunited europe . 
  thailand is not part of nato , neither is ukraine , usa is not obligated to defend them with their military force . 
  the fence is outer ( kaliningrad , belarus etc ) border . 
  hungary gaining independence would likely only come with ethnic hungarian lands . 
  still better than t. of trianon . 
  oh yeah , poland and lithuania had fences during interwar period and everyone knows how well our relations were , [ eu is the reason ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nwlsczo.jpg ) why we became friends again . 
  [ go gay on me .

  corruption . 
   while having a race between austria and prussia over who will end up being the rightful `` germany '' of europe . 
  rather austrian gro\u00dfdeutsche l\u00f6sung ( `` greater german solution '' ) or prussian kleindeutsche l\u00f6sung ( `` lesser german solution '' ) . 
  austria wanted all german people to be unified into one , but prussians did n't want any austrian influence so took smaller germany 's idea , which how imperial germany was created . 
  german girls best girls , then they shout at you in german . 
  oh yeah we forgot that luxembourg , belgium , france , italy , germany and the netherlands are african countries . 
  15 years later , [ january uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_uprising ) in former polish-lithuanian commonwealth would happen against russian empire . 
  the aftermath of this unsuccessful uprising brought several decades of total national oppression by the tsarist regime . 
  [ the map gives me strange feeling .

  not like we care any more . 
   it 's that a majority of americans do n't like the eu guess it 's because they know about it far less than brexiters . 
   comrade triggered . 
  because american house windows go only up . 
  yes you 're right , the european continent will became centre of the earth 's empire . 
  lol sure serbians were angels back then and did n't oppress muslim kosovars, 
  lol sure, 
   i 'm just saying that kosovo broke international law too how so ? 
  it took whole un and years of preparation to make kosovo independent . 
  again russia invaded and annexed the land . 
  if crimeans gained independence without russian intervention i would n't have opposed it . 
  who said i want war there ? 
  who knows what their wishes was , russia invaded the land occupied it . 
  broke international law . 
  our president wanted to refuse soviet ultimatum and prepare for war against ussr , but government did n't because they did n't want a lot of bloodshed , they did n't expect that soviet will not touch civilians if war wo n't happen , did n't matter much since soviets were brutal animals that manage to get themselves seen as worse than nazis . 
  whatever floats your boat mate . 
  nazi germany and ussr , did partition poland . 
  when why russians are still calling everyone fascist and nazi , even though whole new generation is here ? 
  not long ago i heard story from my latvian compatriot that old lady called him fascist because he did n't respond to her in russian . 
  russia invaded and annexed the land , i do n't care about people who live there , i care about international law . 
  we got invaded by [ nazis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_german_ultimatum_to_lithuania ) and the [ soviets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occupation_of_the_baltic_states#soviet_occupation_and_annexation_1940.e2.80.931941 ) . 
  are you really trying to justify partitioning ? 
  no , because they already paid the price ( half of their land was cut off ) , while russians did n't . 
   yes , but so is the wests , so they are equal there . 
  no they 're not , only lithuania , estonia , denmark , norway and greece have conscription , which have relevantly small population compare to russia . 
  the rest of nato army is pure professionals . 
   as for the regular army , russia has some good tactics on getting them expirienced in syria and sadly ukraine . 
  those good tactics in ukraine include sitting your ass down and not getting shot , to create frozen conflict . 
  and syria , well , many of them died and return in unknown coffins , which even family members do n't know how they died . 
  i see , though i do n't agree that they partitions czechoslovakia together with nazis , this absolute bs . 
   the poles regarded the city as of crucial importance to the area and to polish interests . 
   the germans were delighted with this outcome . 
  they were happy to give up a provincial rail centre to poland ; it was a small sacrifice indeed . 
  it spread the blame of the partition of czechoslovakia , made poland a seeming accomplice in the process and confused the issue as well as political expectations . 
  poland was accused of being an accomplice of nazi germany -- a charge that warsaw was hard put to deny . 
  again , on paper , they got massive conscription army in reserve , who are inexperienced . 
   how do you think it got second ? 
  by putting every single ruble into the army , while economy goes to shit , if oil prices keep being low , it will crumble just like ussr did . 
   politics aside , your name is awesome hahah . 
  no need to be jealous . 
   poland signed an agreement with czechoslovakia recognising the border as international source ? 
  well it got invaded by nazi germany from the west and by ussr from the east , it had no chance . 
  that 's why we 're pushing for eu army , which will be possible after uk leaves eu . 
  and russia second in the world is just on paper , it is not tested . 
  and nuke number does n't matter , 100 is as much as 10000 . 
  yeah , easy to say these words when successfully colonized the land . 
  because it took war and years under un supervision on achieving independence , while crimea was annexed over night . 
  finland and poland were n't that stupid . 
  sadly baltic states were stupid enough to let some soldiers enter onto our soil , guess how that ended up , with government getting killed in woods or in exile , while people getting terrorized by commies . 
  ussr tried to invade finland , also invaded and annexed baltic states , while taking away bessarabia from romania . 
  fuck ussr and everything that comes with it , totalitarian state should n't suppose to be praised . 
  this was done during first occupation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainiai_massacre  according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  first thing that land was polish majority , secondly it was stolen by czechoslovakia from poland while it was pre-occupied with with war against soviet russia in aftermath of ww1 . 
  and colonize it with germans and balts , to make prussia great again !, 
   russia is weak economically , it always has been , but it always had a strong military , which syria and ukraine prove is still going strong . 
  their army is just a tear drop in the ocean compare to western or even usa 's alone . 
   well the west called them moderate rebels too . 
  which again is laughable . 
   [ inb4 crimea 2024 ] ( https://youtu.be/zkq6hqn__lk?t=71 ) ftfy, 
   how many germans , french , italians , spaniards are willing to die for the baltics ? 
  every single one . 
   but so is your assumtion that russia is weak and somehow magically the west will win a war for you . 
  your assumption on russia 's strong strength is also some kind of magic .
