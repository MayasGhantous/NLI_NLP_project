  if it was n't for austria , prussia and russia , polish-lithuanian ( pre-modern , equal to that of british or roman ) identity would been completely formed before rise of nationalism .

  we said no , that 's why we joined nato and eu as soon as we could , so they would piss off and mind their own rotten nation .

  balts = / = baltics, 
  same about lithuania . 
   a lot of lithuanians were able to speak good polish as well . 
  because you probably went through vilnius region in lithuania . 
  older folks know more russian than english , younger folks know more english than russian . 
  russian was lingua franca in ussr , now it 's english after joining western world both are mandatory langauges in schools , so it is no surprise . 
  also even in small cities ( like mine with 16k people ) we have german/french/spanish teachers . 
  but belarus is northern rus ' . 
  hardly comparable . 
  we 're a nation , they 're just colonizers that are trying to steal a land . 
   you are wrong . 
  for example roughly one third of population of latvia was against independence of latvia . 
  i am also quite sure significant number of population of estonia was also against independence . 
  because one third of population was ethnic russians ( 52 % latvians vs 33 % russians ) . 
  of course we were , we never wanted to live in what was known as prison of nations . 
  [ yes it was . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5l4o4i/game_developer_grygorovych_creator_of_stalker_and/dbt5xs1/ ), 
   estonia has never been part of russia proper .

  it was full part of russian empire . 
  besides do you realize st petersburg was acquired at same time as estonia [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/great_northern_war_part1.png/800px-great_northern_war_part1.png ) ;[ [ 2 ] ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/great_northern_war_part2.png/800px-great_northern_war_part2.png ) ? 
  when swedish empire and polish-lithuanian commonwealth lost their grip on livonia ? 
  before that they never held those lands , it is one of the reasons why they were n't great power of europe , they did n't had warm sea port access to a sea . 
   perhaps you 'd know that if you knew a bit of history . 
  american teaching my regions history , buwhahahaaaa . 
   and at that point you should maybe ask yourself what this tells you about the image that people in the netherlands have of ukraine . 
  even though their own citizens fell victim to the attack they are not going to tolerate zealous nationalism that reminds them way too much of what russia has been doing in recent history . 
  defending your country from foreign invader is zealous nationalism ... what are you smoking ? 
   if ukraine is willing to throw every aspect of western liberalism away just to fend off the russians they are going to lose their european allies , because we 're not willing to tolerate this shit just for ukrainian sovereignty . 
  maybe if they actually let the association treaty get passed , ukraine 's degradation into more corruption would have been prevented . 
  romania and bulgaria are not best examples but they 're miles ahead of ukraine when it comes to corruption and you can guess why . 
   and with trump getting into the white house the us shield will be gone to . 
  i hope not , that would total catastrophe in european geopolitics . 
  russian domination over half of europe again would only bring misery and complete annihilation of any social improvements . 
   so ukraine better comes back to something that europe sees worth as defending or they 'll end up in a really bad spot . 
  they were already in a bad spot , russia is preventing them from joining both nato and eu . 
  they ca n't really improve their social security when external enemy is occupying their land and constantly threatening them . 
   if you characterise ukrainian citizens as traitors and try to paint them as not ukrainian you 're legitimising ethnic conceptions of the state , which is what you are accusing russia of doing which makes you a hypocrite . 
  they wanted to be ukrainians and ukrainian citizens , they would n't support a pro-russian `` rebels '' . 
   more importantly if you actually try to get into an ethnic turf war with russia i have very bad news for you , you 're going to fucking lose because there 's a metric ton of russians backed by a very powerful state . 
  which is why we need as much nato presence as possible , we do n't want to become a shit hole that russia is . 
  while trump and other pro-russian westerners crying that we 're `` poking the bear '' , they go fuck themselves with a stick . 
   ukraine needs to come back to civil definition of society very fast , or else they 're going to lose their allies . 
  not an easy task when you 're in mid civil war , your country 's economy is going down a drain and dutch show middle finger to eu by not allowing ukraine ratify an association treaty with eu even though their very own citizens died by russian given buk missile to the pro-russian farmers/miners who were not trained enough by the russians . 
  they 're not ukrainians , they 're russian-ukrainians who are supporting imperialistic nation that sits next to their border . 
  if there is one way to describe them it is traitors , nothing more , nothing less . 
  i know exactly that it is russians who are keeping the fight go on , if it was n't for them those `` rebels '' would have been over run long ago . 
  one would thought that those farmers/miners would keep their bullets , guns , tanks , anti-tank equipment etc in basement , but you would need to be absolute retard to accept this . 
  it 's clear as day that russians are supporting them and training them . 
   you ca n't blame russian for ethno-centric expansionism and then try to play the game in reverse . 
  are you really apologizing their invasion and occupation of crimea ? 
  should we also had allowed hitler to expand further and further ? 
  after all he went for all possible german minorities . 
  most of them are ethnic russians , not ukrainians . 
  estonia was everyone 's province if you knew a bit of history of livonia , as much as ukraine . 
  because they do n't annex land of neighbouring country , they do n't practice nuclear strikes on european cities etc. 
  not accepting people left and right would be a good start to prevent this .

  exactly , does n't mean it 's not possible given russia 's recent actions . 
   for being nazi cunts . 
  * everyone is nazi who disagrees with me *, 
  what russia gains from occupying parts of moldova , georgia , ukraine ? 
  to make them unstable to join foreign organizations such as nato/eu , invading us and west not responding would destroy nato once and for all . 
   yes , they are . 
  examples ? 
   i do n't care where the us uses it 's resources , but they are apparently starting to care , electing trump and all . 
  i believe we 're going to see a significant shift in the coming years , and you are probably going to be left without their protection . 
  you forgot one thing , american troops are not the only ones here , there are also german .
