  in that case we should have let hitler take over europe , why risk life ? 
  spineless teenage low tier troll , that 's all you are . 
   we can sell arms to everyone though . 
  god , you 're even more retarded than i thought . 
   i do n't know , germany seems to be doing well . 
  germany is both eu and nato member . 
  plus : - ** main import partners : ** the netherlands 13.7 % france 7.6 % china 7.3 % belgium 6 % italy 5.2 % poland 5 % united states 4.7 % czech republic 4.5 % , united kingdom 4.2 % , austria 4.3 % switzerland 4.2 % ( 2015 ) -  but it 's predictable . 
  of course predictable , that 's why nato should stay as it is to prevent any further russian expansion . 
  that 's what i 'm hoping will never happen . 
  being ally of russia means economic stagnation and social degradation , with rampaging corruption and over all becoming behind from fellow european countries . 
  russia leadership is a rotten cancer to this world . 
  not used to it , thanks for a tip . 
   have their sphere of influence literally , fuck off . 
  yes , that 's why i 'm more than happy to know that these economic migrants are not going to end up here . 
  shit the soviets had to be destructed and re-built because they were not compatible with western standards and very inefficient so please . 
  oh yeah , like you could n't do that without communism ... jesus fuck you 're blind . 
   it 's very good functioning for business then go ahead , install it in serbia , because we do n't want that abomination here . 
  well we were left behind once so you know ... 
  the name itself should already give an idea when was it built . 
  estonia has ugly chicks . 
  should have thrown [ this ] ( https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-531157596-e1463172570228.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600 ) into the picture . 
  green energy already corresponds with less dependence on russian energy . 
   army gets all the fun sometimes . 
  depends where you get deployed . 
  nato [ soldiers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih8w54deot8#t=3m30s ) ca n't get their eyes peeled from lithuanian women . 
  - * frogs have captured us , sir . 
  * - * it was honour to fight with you lads , but we have to do what self respecting lithuanian always [ do ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iob0vvf.png ) *, 
  [ bring it on frenchie . 
  [ there is a reason for that . 
  pretty bs , i 'd say . 
  we love you danija < 3, 
  i wonder how [ you freeze over ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_ney#/media/file:louvre-peinture-francaise-ney-a-kowno-p1020309.jpg ) when you 're such cold hearted . 
  sadly i did not , but i live in city that is centre of railway junction so i see a lot of stuff being transported by trains , including tanks . 
  besides we have our own military academy and training grounds so army stuff is not something that i 'm not used to . 
  every country has pros and cons , we have [ ours ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/lithuania/comments/5jw5jr/so_close_to_perfection/ ) . 
  i thought german banged with english and that 's how dutch was born . 
  edit : / s just a joke . 
  we do n't hate russia or russians , we hate putin and his retarded government . 
  we were , with [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanis\u0142aw_august_poniatowski ) retard as a king of polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  can confirm , i do n't like myself . 
  well germany is loved for [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) , france is loved for [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_invasion_of_russia#crossing_the_niemen ) , uk is just `` my summer camp '' , while usa is seen as beacon of anti-communism and protector of democracy and capitalism , since beginning of ww2 we hoped that american troops would step on our soil rather than for the second time - soviet ones . 
  lithuanians be like : west is best . 
  impossible , it 's not our business what they do middle east or what kind of potential terrorists they detain . 
  why the hell would they put lithuanians were ? 
  we 're pro american and we being terrorist is not our speciality either . 
  did you just got triggered ? 
  those sites were ' t used against lithuanians so i do n't give a single fuck about them , unlike putin 's russia we do n't arrest people who shit on the government . 
   black sites for interrogation pretty sure if your hands are clean you would n't end up there . 
  totally different stuff . 
  boom . 
  nobody forced you to drop that name that was bathed in innocent blood . 
   not in the least because your country have actually fought on the side of nazi germany and so did poland and russia ... are you stupid ? 
  pretty sure he means circassia . 
  there are , but i do n't think any of them have english subtitles .

  do n't forget they drink russian baby blood !, 
  / s fresh acc off the press to shill down the european sub-reddit . 
  good to see you tovarachi . 
  edit : oh look , he deleted his comment , well what would you know . 
  you could also claim scotland , wales , considering their pop difference to england . 
  germany , italy did n't exist as state , plc was in fact e. european version of uk and well russia is equivalent to russia , both sought power and had imperialistic ambitions . 
  so sorry , but no . 
  either way , i rather be french , spanish , german , italian , hell even english than bloody russian .

  a day when half of europe was finally free again . 
  if we were in union in xvii c. with sweden i 'm sure we would have had enough influence on becoming nordic , since we would be historically tied . 
  :p unlike eesti which was just a colony that was interchanged by empires . 
  we had a chance to [ become nordic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) , but you ruined it lenkija . 
  you drunk ? 
   `` germany '' until relatively shortly before then there was ( e.g. 
  kingdom of germany ) but in hre it became complete cluster fuck . 
  and [ austria actually wanted ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_question ) to be part of `` greater germany '' even before the great war and ww ii .

  https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/589cgx/was_mediev edit :  the country poland was in the commonwealth is present belarus . 
  lithuanians who live in current lithuania are in fact samogitians . 
  i know belarusians have identity crisis , but talking this kind of non sense only makes you look like an idiot . 
  yes , braliukas always down for some \u0161akotis . 
  i 'm speaking about polish-lithuanian war . 
  but since we have no real disputes , i guess we can [ try again ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nnopv3i.jpg ) , all we need is former ~ ~ colonies ~ ~ good friends . 
  i wish we were on other side of the world . 
  i hope poland rise as reasonable power in the region , but with a good government ... 
  impossible . 
  they were n't even able to form neo-commonwealth . 
  and after rise of nationalism the multiculturalism caused war . 
   i personally feel europe would be better off under russian rule . 
  your politicians seem determined to destroy your countries . 
  you lost man ? 
  you do n't , because you have no remorse on human suffering . 
  [ the good ol' days ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xzyc6vu.jpg ) . 
  you mean muscle ? 
  that would be west lithuania . 
  they fear the commonblob , they pretend it does n't exist . 
  no different than in lithuania , except they also supported poland 's claim on vilnius . 
  half of them are not even killed by enemy tho ... 
  gdl and plc were the only places in europe where jews were n't prosecuted . 
  finnic mythology does not belong to indo-european , though it have similarities with baltic pantheon . 
  plus you forgot to mention baltic god of thunder - perk\u016bnas , which is also son of main above all god . 
  yes , it is , but christianity changed the meaning .
