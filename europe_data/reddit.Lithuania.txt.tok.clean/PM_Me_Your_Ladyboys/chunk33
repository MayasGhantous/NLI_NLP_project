  death of ussr does n't mean death of russia or russians , it just means end of totalitarian state . 
  half of soviet unions population was n't even russian . 
  [ yes , indeed . 
  curse word for satan . 
  1795 worst year of my life, 
  that also corresponds with jewish being supporters of polish take over of vilnius region . 
  main cities like st. petersburg and moscow are one of the few places in russia that are relatively well kept . 
   of course , greate latvian army , at first win vs ussr , at second vs germany , at last conquer the world . 
  do n't you find it funny yourself ? 
  no , all of europe was against both nazi and soviets , fall of soviets would sure make war longer , until america nuke germany as they did to japan to stop war and make enemy surrender already . 
  which would mean usa become the only super power , ussr is broken down and tear down to pieces , vietnam war , korean war , cuban crisis , space race , nuclear race etc. 
  could not have happened but who knows . 
  what is important that half of europe would not be enslaved by soviet , half of europe would not fall behind in economical and social level of w. europe . 
   no matter for the reasons - if you were fighting against soviets , you were fighting for the nazies . 
  why does fighting for soviets makes it right ? 
  you think we preferred soviets over nazis , when that was typical soviet treatment of lithuania ? 
   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  nazis only targeted jews in the baltic states , even then jews before nazi invasion were most supportive of soviet occupation and regime . 
   i repeat - i do n't think that your should make excuses . 
  in your tradion soviets are worser than nazies , okay . 
  but in our it is completely different and we ca n't understand your position in any way . 
  latvian ss legion are not nazis , we were never nazis , we never were part of nazi party . 
  and holy shit , neither nazis nor fucking soviets were good , both nazi and soviet symbols are banned in our countries because it shows extremism , totalitarian murderous regimes that were no different from each another . 
  but yes you 're right , you and your fellow russians are closet minded , they only look what government shove up their throat . 
   marches , he feels aggression those marches are aimed against soviet occupation , not you . 
   nazis cos you glorify nazies , it is different where , when , what ? 
  if you mean latvian ss legion , they were specifically made in fighting ussr and taking revenge against ussr for first occupation of the country , jews were not their target . 
  after ussr fall they would turn on nazi germany . 
   *** motivation of latvian legionnaires ***  oberf\u00fchrer adolf ax , commander of the 15th division , reported on 27 january 1945 : `` they are first and foremost latvians . 
  they want a sustainable latvian nation state . 
  ** forced to choose between germany and russia , they have chosen germany , because they seek co-operation with western civilization . 
  the rule of the germans seems to them to be the lesser of two evils ** . '', 
   this perspective resulted in part from the soviet occupation between 1940 and 1941 , called '' ** the year of terror ** '' ( latvian : baigais gads ) during which tens of ** thousands of latvian families were executed or deported to siberia with men separated from the women and children ** to break down resistance . 
  -  legionnaires hoped to fight off the red army until it was no longer a threat ** to latvia and then turn against nazi germany , as a repeat of the latvian war of independence of 1918-1920 , when latvian forces expelled both bolshevik and german forces ** . 
  legionnaires ** carried latvian flags ** under their uniforms as a symbol of that hope . 
  -  this sentiment was also reflected in one of the most popular legion songs which went '' ** we will beat the russians now and we will beat the germans after that ** '' . 
  -  latvians , as did the estonians and to lesser degree lithuanians , believed that the western powers , especially britain , would come to their aid as they had in 1918-1920 . 
  - -  the us displaced persons commission in september 1950 declared that :  `` the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states . '', 
  oh yes , i just ca n't wait to invade russia , i ca n't wait to drink and eat all those russian babies !, 
  / s you really that idiotic are n't you ? 
  nato 's primary task is to secure regions safety and stability , the bs that serbs were doing on kosovo and kosovars retaliating is what caused nato to intervene , they did n't give a shit about your yugoslavia , it was as much of union as ussr , held only by one man and after everyone got chance to escape , they did . 
   if nato can decide to `` defend '' separatists in yugoslavia , they can decide to do the same in other countries . 
  that 's not going to happen , even after that it was questioned if nato intervention was legitimate . 
  [ do n't you worry latvia , we will save you . 
  in west , state does n't own most of the media , while in russia and ussr times it did . 
  laughed my ass off . 
  felt like not even him believed what bs he just read . 
  you know why anti-semitic propaganda was easily spread through lithuania in 1941-1944 ? 
  most of jewish lithuanians were supportive of soviet occupation . 
  you know the ussr is fucked up when you greet nazis as liberators . 
   it 's just funny how westerners calls 90s `` period of democracy & freedom '' every single country that was satelite or ex-occupied country by ussr , saw it 's downfall as road to freedom and democracy . 
  we already have all of historical lithuania . 
  grand duchy/kingdom of lithuanian was made from bunch of baltic lands , not only lithuanian , before expanding to ruthenian lands . 
  i know about kaliningrad and what is there well enough . 
  eesti for sure would be happy . 
  still nowhere near it . 
  that still does n't show your * 50 million * . 
  i did n't mean that one killed more than another , i meant that you over underestimating soviet caused casualties while underestimating nazi caused casualties . 
  that source shows nowhere near your  nazis killed like 50 million, 
  what sources you want ? 
  unlike you i do n't claim bs numbers . 
   civilian and military deaths of ww2 in both links there is nothing that proves your given bs numbers :   ussr killed maybe 10 million innocent people max , nazis killed like 50 million ( both civilian and military casualties included ) . 
  what he says it depends on perspective , holodomor fits criteria on being a genocide , considering that ussr disallowed people to go to other countries , that would have saved million of lives . 
  that just proves that ussr was a murderous regime , no better than nazis . 
  just do what swedes do '' * come this way if you 're gay * '' oh wait ... nooooo !, 
  hordes of spaniards inc , what have i done !, 
  in future , definitely ( not eu specifically , but european federation ) , otherwise we will become just puppets to other countries . 
  i 'll be waiting , otherwise you 're a lying shill . 
  if it was n't for memel we would have [ stayed bff ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarpukario_lietuvos_kariuomen\u0117#/media/file:lietuvos_kariuomene_1938.army_of_lithuania_in1938.jpg ) and helped you to :  germany and the soviet union concluded the molotov -- ribbentrop pact in 1939 , dividing eastern europe into their respective spheres of influence . 
  not surprisingly , lithuania was , at first , assigned to germany . 
  the nazis went so far as to suggest a ** german -- lithuanian military alliance against poland and promised to return the vilnius region ** , but lithuania held to its policy of strict neutrality . 
  lithuanian-russians at least . 
   ussr killed maybe 10 million innocent people max , nazis killed like 50 million ( both civilian and military casualties included ) . 
  give me a source on your bs already . 
  neither he 's flaired historian nor does it contain anything you wrote . 
  old comment is not a source . 
  so what , this site is about european countries , let it be politics , culture or nature . 
   ussr killed maybe 10 million innocent people max , nazis killed like 50 million ( both civilian and military casualties included ) . 
  you mixed up the numbers , buddy . 
  -  also , ussr did not commit a genocide . 
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor  in ukraine in 1932 and 1933 that killed an estimated 2.5 -- 7.5 million ukrainians https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainiai_massacre   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive. , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  -  i know that being anti-russian and pro-fascism is popular these days , but facts are facts . 
  being pro-russian and denying the truth is far more popular to be today , all you did is pulled numbers out of your ass without giving source to back it up . 
  and how the hell does that make me pro-fascist and anti-russian for calling out ussr on being as much as shit hole regime as nazi germany ? 
  no he ca n't , nato , eu and usa 's troops are insanely good deterrence , if it was n't for that we would have ended up like moldova , ukraine or georgia long ago . 
  both are to promote european unity and cultural exchange . 
   finland & the baltics lost to the ussr go wank yourself , we do n't want to be economic shit holes again . 
   because these are two different things . 
  not really . 
  white rus ' ( ruthenia ) . 
  there is difference between two entities . 
  we have even older word for them but soviets made sure to delete it from our books - gudija . 
  make finland great again !, 
  it was baltic before it was german , so as creation of prussia you must join imperium lituaniae . 
  the two words are mutually exclusive . 
  germans word for a city meant king 's mountain , while russians renamed the city after mikhail kalinin ( chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet ) . 
  i thought we were [ ostpreu\u00dfen ] ( http://orig06.deviantart.net/d955/f/2013/251/b/9/motf83_by_pischinovski-d6lcsby.png ) . 
  like ussr was n't a genocidal regime ... 
  yes they are . 
  russians in the baltics are more likely to support our independence than do biding of putin .
