  westernized russians are perfectly okay . 
  glorious christendom . 
  c'mon norwy , you get to fish what ever fish you want to fish with your own wish . 
  i wonder if he 's white himself , that would make him even more retarded . 
  same . 
  yes , it 's a continent , otherwise we 're all one big afro-eurasia . 
   by the way , i 'm looking for ** polish minority ** in kaliningrad region . 
  you mean [ * man-pole * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q569djan0c ) . 
  that 's actually really nice , i wish eu was more promoted . 
  do n't forget cool people we got with it !, 
  * shows proofs * `` your proofs are not actual proofs , show me non-west propaganda proofs '', 
  you mean dimensions . 
  they two are same in grand scheme any way , neither is richer or poorer . 
  i can see my ancient domain there . 
  while lithuanians median wage is higher than that of poland 's . 
  the prices are pretty much same between two . 
  you mean milky way ? 
  for a country that has less than 3 million people , no it is not . 
  gudija ( belarus ) forgot it 's [ true roots ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0uulnjx.jpg ) ( those pesky slavs brain washed their tongue ) . 
  accept the [ baltisim ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/bdffvvl_7wmz0krg-6rlcfistpa8gx2vsvefwwh7q1i.jpg?w=691&amp;s=08a3a5f81d783129489ca50a06f164b3 ) in you . 
  i just gave you a source , that it is not . 
  the number of lithuanians that go to shop to poland is barely more than 1 % which is nothing . 
  the media blow this out of proportion and you accept it down your throat happily . 
  only if you help us reconquer what is [ rightfully ours ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jqso1e0.jpg ) . 
  actually it is you who stole whole [ nation ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg/800px-baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg.png ) !, 
  so what ? 
  norwegians go to sweden to shop too . 
  and given the number it 's irrelevant topic , you 're just dick riding media . 
   last time i saw lots of reddit posts that lithuanians go to shopping in poland barely 1 % of lithuanian population goes to shop to poland , oh god lithuania literally mordor now . 
  media sheep , that 's all you are . 
   average wage in poland is still much higher than lithuania despite huge drop in the value of national currency ( lithuania is using euro ) and i 'm guessing the difference 5 months ago would be even higher . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage what are you smoking ? 
  criminals will keep ruling russia . 
  and the world will keep going around . 
  [ a union within a union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_may_3,_1791 ) . 
  europe is built on thousand of years of inner continent wars . 
  even my tiny country had ~ 13 official wars with russia . 
  because back then poland literally meant uk . 
  not like [ russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky#northwestern_krai_governor_general ) were any better . 
  we still existed as [ political entity ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/rpon1793wojew.png ) with same federal level rights . 
  it 's like saying scotland seize to exist within uk . 
  you mean germany ? 
   now , let 's discuss our strategy to once and for all defeat russia just add lithuanian or polish troops up your ranks and you set to go to conquer russia . 
  doubtful . 
  it would probably force us to actually create [ intermarium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ), 
   afghanistan was invaded did afghanistan became 51 state of usa ? 
   russian ally serbia was bombed . 
  for a good reason , they started oppressing kosovo , which created kosovo liberation army , which meant both parties will start fighting each other , when serbians started to commit war crimes against kosovo , only then nato intervened to keep both armies at bay . 
   an end to all military action and the immediate termination of violence and repressive activities by the milosevic government ;  withdrawal of all military , police and paramilitary forces from kosovo ;  stationing of un peacekeeping presence in kosovo ;  unconditional and safe return of all refugees and displaced persons ;  establishment of a political framework agreement for kosovo based on rambouillet accords , in conformity with international law and the charter of the united nations . 
  -  russian ally syria was subverted . 
  how ? 
  when ? 
   a coup was orchestrated in kiev are you brain washed or what ? 
  coup happened because russian lapdog after talking shit load about how we will get closer to eu , magically refuse the association agreement when time comes . 
  ukrainians got enough of being a complete sh * t hole and wanted to be as successful as lithuania , poland or even romania is . 
   remember the `` fuck the eu '' bit ? 
  for a guy that has eu as his flair , sounds ironic . 
  russia has military bases in 10 countries , you point is invalid . 
  i do n't recall usa invading and annexing neighbouring sovereign nations territory . 
   sure russia is the aggressor ... because it is . 
   the anti-russia propaganda has been on an all time high this past while . 
  and anti-usa propaganda should be acceptable ? 
  even though they 're our allies who ensure our region 's safety . 
  source on this bs ? 
  it took over whole world . 
  so you could get revenge on russia . 
  hope senpai notices [ us ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarpukario_lietuvos_kariuomen\u0117#/media/file:lietuvos_kariuomene_1938.army_of_lithuania_in1938.jpg ) . 
  i guess it 's time for commonwealth 2.0 to contain that tumour between us . 
  probably * ugunskrusts * that was adopted when they gained independence in 1918 . 
  yes , but we also have nato . 
   what you mean to say is leave it to the germans to tell the other 26 what to do . 
  spoken like a true brexiter that knows nothing . 
  yep . 
  my city is next to this [ forest ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ynh9chf.jpg ) . 
  you can feel like true [ baltic elf ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/20/the-baltic-elves-taking-on-pro-russian-trolls.html ) while in it . 
  well , should have thought about it before biting our leg off . 
  pilsudski was the last man we could spare to you . 
  poland never lucky with their government . 
  [ usa after trump 's office . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgunpmprxva&amp; ), 
  the territory that is crimea does n't belong to russia de jure , it just occupies it and claims it as their own , so it holds only de-facto control . 
  you do n't understand what de facto and de jure stands for , as i see . 
  de facto , not de jure . 
  he was telling that we lose moral high ground . 
  for pushing sanctions , but not `` accepting refugees '' . 
  yes , apology would be great . 
  sweden apologised for being one of the few countries that recognized soviet annexation of the baltic states as legitimate . 
   local authorities or even unrelated to government citizens did . 
  then why does rf government bitch about when we erase every single soviet monument ? 
  you know we accept refugees ? 
  the problem is that none of them want to live here because they 're economic migrants . 
  we accept refugees that want to relocate here , problem , they do n't . 
  farmers are suffering because of russian count sanctions over consumer goods , eu is targeting financial institutions . 
  better suffer a bit now , than suffer next 50 years , seeing your economy completely destroyed by [ kremlins ] ( http://images.digopaul.com/wp-content/uploads/related_images/2015/09/09/kremlins_3.jpg ) . 
   ** regional superpower ** in europe did you just invented new term ? 
   octorussia i read it as ostprussia and i got confused . 
  nobody can escape gachimuchi, 
  exactly , you have so many things to take proud in , but you take most in military , for no reason . 
  / s but god knows , i expect it was , since we were craving for kingdom status . 
  yeah calling fascist state is far too stretched , but does n't change the fact that russia is becoming a shit hole .
