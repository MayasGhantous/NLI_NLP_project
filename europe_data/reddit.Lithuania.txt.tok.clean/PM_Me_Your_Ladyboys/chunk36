  not really . 
  you 're one big bigot . 
  of course not , but since then does social system define geographical region ? 
   eastern / western europe divide has deep roots from medieval times . 
  what pot are you smoking ? 
  lithuania , estonia and latvia were all part of western sphere of influence , why are n't we called western european then ? 
  lol  lithuania , just like latvia and estonia are eastern european . 
  deal with it . 
  i have no complexes about calling myself eastern european . 
  then good for you , call yourself what ever fuck you want , i could n't care any less about you . 
   do n't be ridiculous ... lithuania , latvia are closer in a lot of ways to poland , slovakia , ... than to sweden or finland . 
  it 's about geopolitics not about culture ( that 's why we 're n. european not nordic/scandinavian ) , we 're leaning towards nordic countries , not towards poland or ukraine . 
   north-western russia you must be joking . 
  literally 0 similarities . 
   it seems like almost every baltic person ashamed of being associated with the slavic countries . 
  where are you getting this from ? 
  it has more to do with bad connotations it has . 
  and using old term that has no meaning in modern world . 
   what are the ukrainians or poles are lesser people than yourself ? 
  it has nothing to do with them . 
  that 's why they 're higher than the rest . 
   greece is southern europe and finland is northern europe . 
  which means baltics are in northern europe . 
  poland , probably . 
  i 'm sure you will find a partner one day , [ closet gayboy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubbasfgnjne#t=20s ) . 
   but nothing changes the fact that if you look at europe if you looked at europe you would realize we 're in northern europe , laying on north european plain . 
   others on its eastern border , and so on . 
  then how the hell is greece and finland is western european . 
  well , unfortunately for you , i 'm not a gayboy . 
   sure , on a political analysis , eastern europe makes on sense . 
  expand , because i do n't see how . 
  we 're not allied with russia . 
  til , japan is eastern europe if that 's criteria , lol . 
  other than homophobia , racism , no . 
  50 years ago w. europe was as much racist and homophobic as we are , it 's matter of time until old people die and statistics change drastically . 
  some `` ex east bloc '' countries already surpassed w. european countries , so it 's just matter of time until we catch up . 
   why would someone be a bigot if they use eastern europe for geopolitically reason just like middle east ? 
  because it made sense before fall of ussr . 
  now it makes 0 sense . 
  speak for yourself caveman . 
  northern europe ? 
  only uneducated bigot would call us e. europe . 
  ussr/communism is dead for past 25 years in europe . 
  the term e. europe should n't apply on modern terms . 
  religion played major role in resisting soviet regime . 
  plus communism itself also . 
  both communist and nazi symbols are banned in the baltics , i do n't see how that helps neo-retarded commie/nazis . 
  butt hurt ? 
  because world was ruled by european countries at that time . 
  i 'm referring to russian government using them as 5th collum , i have no problem with them . 
  i think [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jqso1e0.jpg ) fits every lithuanian . 
  i have russian neighbours , literally no one wants them out because they are fully integrated , knows lithuanian language and are hard working people . 
  [ you fought for the enemy !,

  the less of them the better . 
   [ a new swedish message to russian submarines : ` this way if you are gay . ' ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/05/12/swedens-new-message-to-russian-submarines-this-way-if-you-are-gay/?utm_term=.67b0d94c1152 )   in the video , a neon sign featuring a topless sailor is lowered into the waters where the rogue submarines were spotted . 
  the sign also sends out a morse code message to the surrounding area : `` this way if you are gay . '', 
  yeah , same way baltic states joined ussr democratically ... are you serious ? 
  you 're always welcome down here . 
  good thing nobody knows about us . 
  california = / = catalonia . 
  bro , we breed best leaders when we 're in union with somebody , so ... wan na make a union ? 
  are you butthurt ? 
  those are pagan symbols , them nazis ruined few of them . 
   mickiewicz he was neither lithuania , nor pole , nor bloody belarusian , he was [ polish-lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) , not in modern sense , but equal to that of roman or british . 
  belarus , ukraine and russia all have rights to claim kievan rus ' , it 's same as roman empire . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  you get my point . 
  european countries take religion as cultural aspect of the country , while meda takes it as must have laws of the state . 
  times when turkey was actually becoming european . 
   tl ; dr : russian leaders suck dick . 
  since you do n't want ussr . 
  here you go . 
   eliminate the polish language from public life  prevent the employment of catholics in government institutions  control and restrict the catholic church  create favorable conditions for the spread of eastern orthodoxy  replace lithuanian parish schools with russian grammar schools  encourage ethnic russians to resettle in lithuanian lands  replace the latin alphabet with the cyrillic alphabet  ban any lithuanian-language publications in the latin alphabet https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_press_ban, 
   `` union '' you pronounced occupation wrong . 
  because it 's russia , they do n't invade for benefits , they invade to obtain more land , destroy the local population and replace it with ethnic russians , completely russifying the region and doing over and over again . 
  i do n't care about them , that 's all i can say . 
  better have neither . 
  compare canadian population to that of european . 
  besides that 's not what i meant i was talking about one nations policy to that of few dozens , he speaks as europe is one and same nation with same interests . 
  `` i rather have cancer than aids ... '' great choice mate . 
  both whites and reds were our enemies . 
  we had wars with both of [ them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_wars_of_independence#war_against_the_bermontians ) . 
  well , it was prison of nations after all . 
  yes we have , does n't mean it 's effective or that every member will accept . 
  we 're all sovereign nations . 
  europe is made of several dozen countries , and you 're comparing it to one little canada ... are you serious ? 
  germany always have baltics . 
  without taking over their neighbours they have no way in uniting with german revolution , which proves that the war was aimed at acquiring new territories so they could reach up west .
