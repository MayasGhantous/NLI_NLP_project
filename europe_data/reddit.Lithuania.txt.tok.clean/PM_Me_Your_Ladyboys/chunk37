  even after ww2 they annexed as much as they could so they would be able to border west to control satelite states . 
  actually modern poland is more or less is from where it [ started ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/dzia\u0142ania_podczas_wojny_polsko_niemieckiej_1002-1005.png ) .

  they tried to conquer us including all of germany . 
  i do n't understand what are you trying to prove . 
   upon receiving the news about the german revolution , on november 13 , 1918 , the soviet government annulled the treaty of brest-litovsk and issued orders to the red army to move in the direction of belarus , ukraine and the baltic states in order to establish soviet governments there . 
  i do n't , i said being under tsarist russia is better than being under soviets . 
  innocent people would n't been killed left and right , young and old . 
   but that war was n't about conquering lithuania that was exactly to conquer lithuania and possibly poland , we were bridge towards western world , both of us were neighbouring germany . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_soviet_socialist_republic_ ( 1918 -- 19 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013byelorussian_soviet_socialist_republic, 
  just a fan art . 
  that multiculturalism was getting destroyed by soviet government . 
   whites -   overall , the white army was nationalistic , rejected ethnic particularism and separatism . 
  ** the white army generally believed in a united multinational russia , and opposed separatists who wanted to create nation-states ** instead of the tsarist russian empire . 
  amongst white army members , anti-semitism was widespread . 
   most europeans living in the former russian empire ( such as myself ) mostly remember whites for their opposition of new independent countries - ** something not shared by lenin ** . 
  [ you sure ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ), 
  both russian empire and ussr were sh * t states , case closed . 
  russian oppression of lithuanians ended at 1904 . 
  still it probably would been better to have your books banned than this :  according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  and this happened after first soviet occupation , year prior to operation barbarossa . 
   they both had a laugh . 
  that `` had '' makes me worried .

  poland and the blonde girl next to her represents lithuania that are awaiting to be exiled into siberia . 
  love you too . 
  anyone ? 
   vilenian poles i ca n't tell from my own experience , as i have never met one in my life . 
  but from what i know they live like any other minorities in europe . 
  other than this kremlin 's puppet - [ waldemar tomaszewski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valdemar_toma\u0161evski ) which wants to stir things up in what ever possible way . 
  he even had to unite local polish and russian nationalists to gain enough support on getting elected . 
  [ met her in the crowd at the right wing rally ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxtphnmdozu#t=21s ), 
  sounds more like russia + racism . 
  your logic ai n't solid either , otherwise finland , greece is also in eastern europe . 
  and you 're an english sea . 
  yes . 
  girls at gym have fetish for stylized socks . 
  we should hit the gym after leaving grandmas house . 
  well as i said , it 's complicated . 
  on one side you have a small country that just escaped oppressing empire and sough recognition by other nations , with territorial disputes on both sides , you have german/lithuanian mix in west and polish/lithuanian mix in east . 
  claiming it 's historical capital that was n't ethnically lithuanian any more . 
  it 's really arguable because [ before ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a6u4rgb.jpg ) lithuanian book press ban vilnius was majority lithuanian . 
  but it gradually become more belarusian as the time went on because :  ** eliminate the polish language from public life **  ** prevent the employment of catholics in government institutions **  ** control and restrict the catholic church **  ** create favorable conditions for the spread of eastern orthodoxy **  ** replace lithuanian parish schools with russian grammar schools **  ** encourage ethnic russians to resettle in lithuanian lands **  ** replace the latin alphabet with the cyrillic alphabet **  ** ban any lithuanian-language publications in the latin alphabet ** most lithuanians were bilingual at very least before press ban . 
  after press ban was lifted in 1904 it gradually become polonized since k. of poland was in `` personal union '' with russian empire , therefore had autonomy , so becoming pole you would acquire higher status in society . 
  so vilnius completely become polish . 
  yada yada ww1 , the city becomes contested territory because of it 's multicultural , multiethnic history . 
  and poles at that time either considered lithuanians as brothers , or they did n't consider them at all as a nation , rather just province - `` schizophrenic part of poland '' . 
  while lithuanians saw polish `` federalism '' huge threat to nation , because our culture and language was already dying . 
   at the time international situations of newly independent poland and lithuania were unequal . 
  poland , much larger in territory and population , was dedicated point # 13 in woodrow wilson 's fourteen points . 
  it was recognized by all nations of the entente , officially invited to the paris peace conference , and became one of the founding members of the league of nations . 
  poland also enjoyed a close alliance with france . 
  lithuania did not receive international recognition ( it was first recognized de jure in july 1920 by soviet russia ) as the entente hoped to revive the russian empire within its former territory , which included lithuania . 
  not invited to any post-war diplomatic conferences , it also had to battle negative propaganda that the council of lithuania was a german puppet , that lithuanians harbored pro-bolshevik attitudes , or that lithuania was too small and weak to survive without a union with poland . 
  the only reason poland did n't fully occupy lithuania was because of it 's prestige in world stage , they did n't want to be seen as imperialistic nation . 
   i always thought that poland and ukraine ( in particular , western ukraine ) had common history , the same as you with the poles . 
  poland was influenced by western world , while kievan rus ' ( modern day belarus , russia and ukraine ) were influenced by eastern world - byzantine empire . 
  poland adopted latin alphabet , roman catholic faith etc. 
  while kievan rus ' adopted modified version of greek alphabet - cyrillic from bulgarians , christianizing themselves as eastern orthodox faith . 
  while lithuanians at that time stayed pagan up until xiv century , only after that personal union with poland and wars with teutonic order brought western influence to us . 
  we just happened to occupy their land and did n't force any cultural assimilation towards them . 
  poland and lithuania are identical culturally , even though we speak different language and we come from different ethnicities . 
  belarus and ukraine are identical , but they do n't have huge cultural bond as we do with the rest of post modern commonwealth . 
  even though you 're right when it comes to borders ... europe is not best place to look at it . 
  which is why southern europe exists . 
  west vs east should be used purely only on cold war topic , not on general use . 
  beer is more popular than vodka here . 
  eastern europe is a cold war relic . 
  lithuania , latvia , estonia , poland have nothing in common with belarus , russia and ukraine other than being post commie states . 
  exactly , russia is all for `` free people 's republics '' as long as they 're not the ones that are within russia . 
  nothing to be sorry about , it was complicated post plc era . 
  rip estonia . 
  good thing france is irrelevant since end of napoleonic era , muwhahaha . 
  p.s : fuck napoleon , he did n't promise us independence and instead wanted to steal our church . 
  russians are just [ lonely ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aawkuto.png ) jealous little guys who just want to be loved as much as [ usa ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5703/22413217086_7499d841c4_o.jpg ) , they 're just misunderstood . 
   does this mean russia will end its imperialistic tendencies towards ~ ~ ukraine west russia ~ ~ littlerussia ?

  ethnic cleansing . 
  that land was inhabited by various ethnic groups , it 's hard to guess which one is rightful . 
  while their army was occupying it ... something , something republic of central lithuania .

  old design . 
  if you think we 're threat to germany then ban us . 
  lithuanian and poles are legal economic migrants , muslims are not legal , in most cases smuggled by human traffickers , there is huge difference . 
  we did not ask them to come here , we do not want them to come here , yet germany is forcing it down our throats . 
  given we have relationship we should have had during interwar period we might revive [ a good idea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqcbp4-c5su ) once again , since it corresponds with prometheism either way . 
  not wanting to except mena migrants is now being right-wing ? 
  what ? 
  in lithuanian language we have word - * kretinas * which also means idiot . 
  * from french word cr\u00e9tin, 
   did you spend time in a muslim country ? 
  no butch watching non-edited videos of muslims on hungarian border gave me pretty much good idea on what kind of civilization they came . 
   i grew up in a muslim majority country european muslims are far less radical than mena muslims . 
  we will see soon enough .
