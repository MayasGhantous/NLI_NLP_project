  illegal economic migrants are not our burden , but i wish we could help to stop flow of it into europe . 
   if the only thing keeping you in the eu , is free money from the west , then i say good riddance lithuania . 
  we joined eu because of russia , we wanted to be as close to west as possible , of course improving our economy is our top priority which is why we 're far more successful than russia or ukraine . 
  but if another country starts to dictate another country 's foreign policy then , yes i hope we leave eu . 
  i 'm quite a european federalist , but migrant crisis and bitching for not taking `` your share '' after opening borders made me quite eurosceptic , if people like you will grow then as i said i 'm more than happy to see lithuania leaving eu , contrary hope east actually achieves intermarium idea since west clearly cares about themselves , why should we care about west ? 
  go to saudi arabia or any other radical country and see yourself . 
  you 're free to block us , i 'm not against it . 
  those are individuals though . 
  it feels like some next level lefties that are jerking off on migrants crisis are filling / r/europe day by day . 
   given that lithuanians are more prone to crime than the people of mentioned countries . 
  yeah i forgot , i 'm a criminal by birth ... you know why nobody wants to have gypsies as neighbours ? 
  because they have different values from common folk , you know why people do n't want muslims as neighbours ? 
  because they too have different values than common folk . 
  he 's butthurt and blinded , let him be . 
   let eastern europe decide if they want them or not . 
  not really our business . 
  if it is about sharing the costs of the refugees , we could look into covering east europes share of the costs , by taking some of the money they get each year from western europe . 
  those are eu funds , not `` your funds '' , we too pay % of our gdp into it you know ? 
  these economic migrants do n't want to live here because they ca n't suck as much from welfare as in germany or sweden , why do you think they would leave the very first chance they given ? 
  neither i nor my country shares burden of accepting these migrants , the last thing i would want is to endanger my countrymen with mena people who have another cultural dimensional background . 
  prussia was n't originally inhabited by germans either , it was first inhabited by old prussians ( balts ) . 
  gib greek weather girls in return then . 
  unlikely . 
  even high concentration of [ light hair and eye colour ] ( http://i.imgur.com/goo27w2.png ) is not specific to scandinavia . 
  tell me at least one state that came out rich that previously had communist regime . 
   romania has 27 years capitalism , what has improved ? 
  so being less successful than former eastern bloc is reason to bring back , let alone praise communism ? 
  my great grandmother was raped and killed by red army soldier , thanks a lot . 
  danes , poles and russian all three are three different worlds . 
  besides this is geographical definition no cultural , if it was cultural we would be central european given that we share more with germans and poles than we do with russians . 
  talking about polish and lithuanian borders . 
   early 1992 also brought hopeful developments , however . 
  the foreign ministers of the two nations signed a wide-ranging tenpoint declaration of friendship and neighborly relations and a consular convention . 
  in the declaration , each country renounced all territorial claims against the other and pledged to adhere to european standards in respecting the rights of its minorities , including native-language education rights . 
  he 's pro-commie + anarchist , so yeah i wonder why . 
  west is not isolating russia , it 's russia who is isolating itself from the west . 
  beautiful city . 
  russia is supporting break away `` republic '' in moldova who has no sea access , if given opportunity russia will 100 % meddle in romanian affairs . 
  because of heavy industry , at last i assume . 
  most russians were relocated to fill workforce in factories . 
  also ussr was colonizing us with russians , during early 90 's ethnic latvians made only 50 % of latvian state . 
  [ you 're telling me i should celebrate this ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_the_baltic_states_ ( 1940 \\ ) ), 
  they should n't suppose to be considered liberators when they [ soviets ] were first occupying force and first killing machine to cross our borders . 
  fresh acc off the press , can you still smell it ? 
  [ yeah boy . 
  futa man . 
  we would love to , but there is one big reason why we would n't . 
  i know . 
  i 'm just saying it was n't hard to meddle in their internal matters when they were already getting controlled by west . 
  you know it 's hard to remember those soldiers when your own family member died at hands of them making nazis look like good guys . 
  actually a fully rehabilitated russia could potentially be candidate but that would take insane and full rehab . 
  usa did n't fought on european continent ? 
  icelandic language in nutshell . 
  yes , baltic ss fought for freedom of latvia and estonia , soviets fought because their own high command aimed weapons on their backs . 
   `` buffer states '' are a nice way to say `` colonies '' , by the way . 
  i do n't remember czeckslovakia or any other commie puppet state being colonized by russians . 
  [ empire of japan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/japanese_empire_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/600px-japanese_empire_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png ) . 
  korea was a colony for japan , eastern china was occupied territory with puppet governments . 
   japan was in desperate need of resources to keep their war industry rolling as they had alienated any relevant trading partners . 
  resources like oil and rubber is why they swent to war in east and south east asia . 
   and no , we ca n't blame the us for embargoing japan when they started doing fucked up shit . 
  that is what you do to punish shit like that . 
  nobody is talking about usa here , why do you bring them up ? 
  fun fact lithuania was not invited for these olympic games because we started to prosecute [ pro-nazis ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/noimano-zaso_byla ) in klaip\u0117da region . 
  yeah , i know we all were in between two shit holes - nazi germany and soviet union . 
  true but we 're talking about european theatre . 
  i 'm not defending japanese war crimes , i 'm just saying that it was n't hard for japanese to control eastern chinese territories . 
  soviet union invaded and annxed eastern part of it , do you call it liberation ? 
   the ussr was never allied as such to germany [ ??? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gestapo\u2013nkvd_conferences ) [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german\u2013soviet_military_parade_in_brest-litovsk ), 
  then again china was already getting fucked by western colonial powers . 
  [ hmm . 
  [ welcome to finland !, 
  exactly . 
   soviets invaded us first and i 'm talking about nazis and soviet occuopation of baltic states , which was started by soviet invasion . 
  uk , france and usa joined war as soon as poland was invaded , while ussr invaded poland together with nazis , there is huge difference . 
  not every german soldier was nazi either , should we erase statues for them too ? 
  because you know , soviets invaded us first and we greeted them as actual liberators . 
  biggest player against nazism only after their own ass started to roast , or do people forget that ussr was n't part of allies prior to operation barbarossa and was invading and occupying other neighbouring countries left and right ? 
  one monster does not make other monster not monster . 
  okay . 
  what you said made me laugh , good job . 
  it was long time ago in one of his speeches , would be quite hard to find now . 
  difference is that ukrainians are not from other cultural dimension . 
  i like this sarcasm . 
  i 'm far more keen to take ukrainians than i would ever will be with mena people , good for you poland for giving these people a chance to gain something more in life . 
  yes , even putin said it himself . 
  `` great patriotic war '' started with operation barbarossa , after winter war was over which influenced germans to invade ussr . 
   is not a threat to europe yeah , georgia , moldova , ukraine shows that ... 
   go look back at history . 
  so being occupied by ussr/tsarist russia ... 
  russians try to write history in their favour , just like soviets did e.g. 
  * soviets liberated half of poland and re-united those lands with soviet ukrainians and belarusians * , * baltic states joined ussr willingly , there were `` legit '' elections there * and now * finland shelled our soldiers , we definitely did n't do that ourselves * . 
  given that you did n't fall under soviets as finnish democratic republic , i 'd say you won . 
  half of european continent was never colonial empire , let alone most of them sat under other european empires . 
  latvian , estonian , finnish , slovenian , croatian , bosnian , romanian , czech , slovakian , albanian empires unite !, 
  they only see `` great patriotic war '' everything before that does n't matter . 
  well ussr was n't part of allies during winter war , considering they only started to care once their own ass started to roast .
