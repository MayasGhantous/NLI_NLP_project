  it was during tsarist times . 
  lithuanians are pro-eu , pro-nato and pro-west over all , so yeah . 
   as a sub on / r / ~ ~ socialism ~ ~ backtostoneage, 
   khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that beria had , immediately after stalin 's stroke , gone about `` spewing hatred against [ stalin ] and mocking him . '', 
  when stalin showed signs of consciousness , beria dropped to his knees and kissed his hand . 
  when stalin fell unconscious again , beria immediately stood and spat . 
  because russia and ussr were based in europe ? 
  russia was always western nation , ussr past is what created the rift between them and west . 
  they 're not gays , they 're just sadistic fucks that like to torture . 
  so you 're telling me that lithuania did not choose to ally with usa ? 
  hmm . 
  winter is coming . 
  also it 's because those were * colonial * empires . 
  yeah i forgot , usa the 900 years adversary occupied lithuania ... killed and exiled lithuanian people ... and crushed people with tanks , yes indeed we 're occupied by usa ... 
   fucking search it yourself about russia joining nato . 
  so you 're trying to prove something without having any source , great way of arguing . 
   `` hurr durr that 's not excuse for invasion '' - a fucking country is getting cornered in a region , of course they 're going to do something about it okay ... 
  so because sovereign nations choose to be allied with usa ukraine , georgia or moldova has to `` pay price '' for it ? 
  what kind of logic is that . 
   welcome to the fucking world you stupid crybaby . 
  you have mental problem , for real . 
  hey , thank poland , it created prussia . 
  * lenin : god dammit stalin , why did nobody stop you . 
  yeah , i do n't remember my father or mother screaming at me : `` you 're gay now , my son '' . 
   for some time , russia was n't even a threat , ** in fact putin proposed to join nato , his proposal was declined and i 'm not surprised why ** source ? 
   if crimea would n't have been annexed , they would 've lost a huge portion of control over the black sea and their naval base . 
  that 's not excuse for invasion and annexation of other sovereign nation 's land . 
  germans : remove roman lithuanians : remove teuton, 
   you admit yourself they can not even dominate countries on their own border they ca n't dominate , instead they choose to fuck over neighbouring countries and send little green men . 
   i can not comprehend how anyone could acknowledge that and still claim russia is the sole aggressor nato border moves east because sovereign nations are scared of yet another time of russian aggression as ukraine , moldova and georgia shows . 
  he 's pretty much posting only pessimistic view of nato , says on whose side he is and who he is . 
  so russia has green light to fuck over several nations ? 
   if russia is the aggressor , they are aggressively pushing their border in the opposite direction there is a reason former warsaw pact countries and former soviet occupied countries joined nato the first moment they got ...

  ask mods to include them then . 
  he 's lying , soviets intended to annex finland too . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_democratic_republic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_wille_kuusinen#head_of_the_terijoki_government, 
   they abandonned the idea of a ` socialist ' finland after their defeat in the civil war back in 1918 you forgot about puppet state of ussr during winter war - [ finnish democratic republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_democratic_republic ) . 
   religion is n't only set of rules , it 's also a tie that connects people into communities . 
  / u/piganimal [ +2 ] was corrected in some sense also one that splits communities . 
   many things like the big bang , genetics and others were discovered by christians [ watch this please .

  [ relevant . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hixseiqygxq ), 
  yes . 
   while failing main but hidden goal - occupation all of finland which counts as victory for finland . 
   you mean all those americans and brits , that do n't even know of our countries are going all out to protect us like we 're part of their civilization ? 
  no , all american , german etc. 
  soldiers that are located here will . 
  they will backpedal when they 'll see the first tanks approaching them . 
  it 's not their homeland . 
  they 're bullies that force us to pay them money `` for protection '' like mafia did in 1930 's . 
  okay ... you lost your head completely . 
  nobody knows that england and lithuania were technically at war . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  plus learn [ history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_democratic_republic ) . 
  everyone knows ancient estonian civilization that created an [ empire ] ( http://forumcontent.paradoxplaza.com/public/123222/the_mighty_estonian_empire.png ) reigned over several continents 6000 years ago . 
  back in middle school scooter was the sh * t xd, 
   du ** nn ** ai we 're not estonians m ` kay, 
  nearby european country being in war with another nearby european country at some point in history , whoa what a surprise . 
  it 's does not make sense in english , it does in lithuanian though . 
  pretty sure these guys are happy inside as they consider that they 're doing god 's work . 
  actually it 's complicated more than that . 
  both sides ( serbians and kosovars ) are to blame . 
  during winter war ussr was n't part of allies yet . 
  prior to winter war nazi germany and ussr were collaborating with each other in [ economic matters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german\u2013soviet_credit_agreement_ ( 1939 \\ ) ) and [ military matters ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/spotkanie_sojusznik\u00f3w.jpg ) ( german and soviet soldiers shaking hands in middle of poland ) . 
  i guess you 're pretty bad at studying because ...  ussr 's sphere of influence * everything that fell under ussr 's sphere of influence in secret protocols of molotov -- ribbentrop pact was annexed after ww2 . 
  nordics are full of weird people , my kind of people . 
  that 's what defence ministers job is , to look at what could breach our security and safety of lithuanian citizens . 
  as i said words . 
  russians in duma are spewing about invasion , nuking of ungrateful eastern european states non-stop . 
  and we 're talking about winter war not continuation war . 
  besides finland did not collaborate with nazi germany . 
  this is just probability . 
  lithuania , estonia and latvia is going to become similar to that of s. korea and n. korea , place where words and dick waving will come out from either side . 
   i mean , just because they were neutral does n't mean they did n't collaborate . 
  finland was n't allied nor co-belligerent with nazi germany against ussr , winter war was pure finnish-ussr war . 
   not saying they did n't help the allies , too , but the winter war is still an allied victory . 
  ussr was not part of allies during winter war ... 
  armed forces do . 
  either way russia is too pathetic to do a full scale invasion , they can only limit themselves to hybrid warfare . 
  given we 're part of eu , nato , eurozone , impossible else we already been fucked over like georgia , ukraine and moldova are , i feel sad for those people that suffer under yet another russian dictatorship 's geopolitical goals . 
  and then russian army gets destroyed back by nato forces , just like you were . 
  finnish democratic republic, 
  those are in links . 
  establishment of soviet puppet state - finnish democratic republic supports my words . 
   seriously , is that what you were taught in schools ? 
  that the ussr tried taking all of finland in the winter war ? 
  no , winter war is not included in our curriculum since we were occupied by soviet union and were more concerned with surviving red terror more than anything . 
  with fire from fgm-148 javelin , yes . 
  okay ... 
  yes it does . 
   the finnish democratic republic was a short-lived puppet government created and ** recognised only by the soviet union ** . 
  -  when the red army began its advance during the winter war on november 30 , 1939 , kuusinen was pronounced head of ** the finnish democratic republic ( also known as the terijoki government ) -- joseph stalin 's puppet regime through which stalin intended to rule finland ** . 
  a `` declaration of the people 's government of finland '' was issued in terijoki on december 1 , 1939 , and a `` treaty of mutual assistance and friendship between the soviet union and the democratic republic of finland '' signed by molotov and kuusinen in moscow on december 2 , 1939 ** however , the war did not go as planned , and the soviet leadership decided to negotiate a peace with the finnish government ** ; kuusinen 's government disbanded and he was made chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet of the karelo-finnish ssr ( 1940 -- 1956 ) . 
  so you deny existence of [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_democratic_republic ) and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_wille_kuusinen#head_of_the_terijoki_government ) ? 
  finland is neither spain nor sweden . 
  given secret protocols of molotov -- ribbentrop pact pact and establishment of finnish democratic republic it is clear as day they wanted all of finland . 
  could n't cares less . 
  [ finland was neutral .
