  hope your questions are sarcastic ones . 
  of course , but our language was still quite influenced by polish language before early xx c. 
   the main problem with the language is the fact that it 's ** mostly made up ** and badly promoted . 
  can you explain this to me , please ? 
   both capitals - in poland . 
  capital krak\u00f3w and vilnius ( 1569 -- 1793 )  the monarch - in poland . 
  that 's irrelevant where monarch resided most of plc kings were n't polish or lithuanian . 
  both poland and lithuania had seimas , separate laws , separate treasury , separate army , just one country and one geopolitics . 
   most of the population - in poland . 
  what ? 
  poland was n't even half of population of commonwealth , most nobility and of course most influential nobilities of commonwealth were either from lithuanian or ruthenian lands , samogitia itself had 15 % of nobility biggest concentration in all of commonwealth . 
   most of the economy ( before the deluge ) - in poland . 
  you clearly know nothing about commonwealth . 
   official languages - latin and polish , never lithuanian . 
  you 're right but are you really trying to paint medieval state to modern state ? 
  every self respecting historian would laugh at you right now . 
   it was poland in all but name . 
  [ maybe for uneducated person like you . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ), 
  poland and lithuania are counted as one country pre-1569 which is very strange . 
  [ best day of my life .

  1400 for us, 
   gdl was a whole new state , not a successor of rus ' , therefore it was more about his religion that makes it christian kingdom or not , and he was lithuanian pagan as far as we know . 
  well i guess denouncing christian faith and going back to paganism did really lost us a lot of potential influence . 
   5 : statute of 1588 has `` statute of the great principality of lithuania '' written on it . 
  maybe this is because ruthenian being the official language thing but dutchy and principality are still different words . 
  both * principality * and * duchy * are same words in lithuanian and polish languages . 
  pretty sure it 's written * principality * due to ruthenian language which also gives you impression of that word usage . 
  in latin it was always written as * ducatus * . 
  * the official name of the state was the kingdom of poland and the grand duchy of lithuania ( latin : regnum poloniae magnusque ducatus lithuaniae ) and the latin term was usually used in international treaties and diplomacy . 
   1 : the fact that ruthenian could have not been a main spoken language does not prove anything , it definitely does not prove that lithuanian was one . 
  lithuanian language was spoken within lithuanian lands ( when addressing lithuanians ) , ruthenian language was spoken in ruthenian land ( when adressing ruthenians ) , courts were in french/german , latin was used when writing to pope , applying one language to such multi-cultural state is stupid . 
   3 : not all slavs were baptized , actually there are sources that confirm slavic paganism was quite big 30 years before st. bruno thing happened , doubt that it changed drastically in that time , there still could be many pagans at that time . 
  does n't change the fact that ruthenia was already officially christian land . 
  if mindaugas had a child to inherit kingdom of lithuania we would have retained our christian kingdom status . 
   5 : it 's not about the titles it used when communicating with others that matters but about what title it used in it 's documents , which was the great principality . 
  what are you biasing this on ? 
  still it would been under polish aegis , nobody other than poland and france wanted it . 
  i literally wanted to call him out . 
  yeah i guess it too . 
  we sure were loser of polish-lithuanian war , but we were n't submitting to them , contrary we had great hate towards them , though it faded away as interwar years were passing by to the point where we actually refused hitler offer to invade poland from the north to regain vilnius region and instead took both civilian and military refugees , even though they gave us ultimatum to establish diplomatic relations ( which we agreed on ) and recognize vilnius as polish city ( which we did n't ) or face `` invasion '' . 
   i 'm not sure how much you get into historical debates on / r/europe , but i routinely read poles writing historical fiction about how they were buddies with lithuanians during the interwar period and nobly fighting bolshevism until big bad russia once again fucks them . 
  never have i read these kind of comments , it 's always mutual enmity during interwar period . 
  and it 's actually [ germans ( saxons ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) who we should be thanking for helping us to not become soviet , though probably poland coming out as victor in polish-soviet war has more to do with our independence being secured , even though they tried to do a [ coup d'\u00e9tat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_polish_coup_d%27\u00e9tat_attempt_in_lithuania ) in lithuania . 
  either way during interwar period we were called by poles as `` german puppets '' ( mostly due to prussian-lithuanian influence ) and only annexation ( poles called it union ) into polish state would help us get rid of german influence , that we were too weak to exist . 
  but then again , there were [ polish-lithuanians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) likes pilsudski who actually wanted unify ex-commonwealth in as much peaceful matter as possible , naively thinking people would rally under polish banner and people like roman dmowski , nationalists who trashed talked their way in league of nations and wanted [ annexation of lithuania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/liniadmowskiego.png ) , but gave up on it and wanted to only pure polish lands , if necessary assimilated minorities into polish state fully . 
  strategic key points ? 
  meh light hair and light eyes are daily feature here , at least north central lithuania . 
  yeah , flag is super weird . 
   then stole lithuania 's capital . 
  it sucks for sure , but then again it 's more complicated than that . 
   poland also had no problems bullying the lithuanians into submitting at that time we did n't submit shit . 
  they were enemies to us as much as they were to weimar republic/nazi germany and ussr . 
  they have potential the thing is they 're not making it possible . 
  [ somewhere in another universe . 
  ban literally intensified polonization on peasantry , what are you talking about ? 
  before that only nobility were polonizing except in western lithuania where highest concentration of lithuanian nobility was , consequently most rebelling one against polonization . 
   according to some scholars the biggest successes in polonisation of the non-polish lands of former commonwealth were achieved after the partitions , in times of persecution of polishness ( noted by leon wasilewski ( 1917 ) , mitrofan dovnar-zapolsky ( 1926 ) ) . 
  paradoxically , the substantial eastward movement of the polish ethnic territory ( over these lands ) and growth of the polish ethnic regions were taking place exactly in the period of the strongest russian attack on everything polish in lithuania and belarus . 
   the general outline of causes for that is considered to include the activities of the roman-catholic church and the cultural influence exacted by the big cities ( vilna , kovno ) on these lands , the activities of the vilna educational district in 19th century -- 1820s , the activities of the local administration , still controlled by the local polish or already polonised nobility up to the 1863 -- 1864 january uprising , secret ( polish ) schools in second half nineteenth to the beginning of the 20th century ( tajne komplety ) and the influence of the land estates . 
  so they would have experience in potential battlefield ? 
  both belarus ( gudija ) and lithuania are successor states of grand duchy of lithuania , samogitia and ruthenia , most commonly known as just g.d. of lithuania . 
   belarus even claims that lithuania `` stole '' their history . 
  for people who do n't know about [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/589cgx/was_medieval_lithuania_actually_the_grand/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=u_pm_me_your_ladyboys ) . 
  underrated heroes . 
  and now n. cyprus is like a tumour to actual cyprus . 
  pretty sure ifvs would be used to relocate soldiers safely from one battle to another , it would make no sense to use them against main battle tanks . 
  what else you want ? 
   since the neolithic period the native inhabitants of the lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside , so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements , although without being actually isolated from them . 
  the lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous , without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups . 
  -  a 2004 analysis of mtdna in a lithuanian population revealed that lithuanians are close to both [ indo-european ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corded_ware_culture ) and [ uralic-speaking populations of northern europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pit\u2013comb_ware_culture ) . 
  y-chromosome snp haplogroup analysis showed lithuanians to be closest to balts , russians , belarusians and finnish people . 
  autosomal snp analysis situates lithuanians most proximal to latvians , followed by the east slavs , furthermore , all slavic peoples and germans are situated more proximal to lithuanians than finns and northern russians . 
  -  lithuanian ashkenazi jews also have interesting genetics , since they display a number of unique genetic characteristics ; the utility of these variations has been the subject of debate . 
  one variation , which is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia , has been dated to the 14th century , corresponding to the establishment of ashkenazi settlements in response to the invitation extended by vytautas the great in 1388 . 
  -  lithuanians , like most other baltic/scandinavian cultures , have been known for being people of above average height . 
  at the end of the 19th century , the average height of males was 163.5 cm ( 5 ft 4 in ) and the average height of females was 153.3 cm ( 5 ft 0 in ) . 
  by the end of the 20th century , heights averaged 181.3 cm ( 5 ft 11 in ) for males and 167.5 cm ( 5 ft 6 in ) for females . 
  it 's not for a direct fight against tanks , but for stalling invading forces with non stop arterially barrages until nato reinforcement comes in . 
  flat-landia . 
  plus our priority is defence which means we need weapons that can stop rolling tanks onto our land . 
  not justified at all . 
  just do n't understand logical reason for xenophobia against poles , then again , xenophobes and racists are far from being logical beings .
