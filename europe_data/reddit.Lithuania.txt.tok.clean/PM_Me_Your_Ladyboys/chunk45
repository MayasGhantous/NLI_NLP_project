  there is a reason why only soviet russia ( later ussr ) came out as commie after ww1 . 
   as far as remember being member of something and having some agreements did not help poland when hitler invaded it . 
  no but german , french , dutch and most importantly usa troops are located here as deterrent to not even cross the border .

  * between 1918 and 1922 , some 9000 finnish volunteers took part in these conflicts , either to assert finnish control over the areas inhabited by related finnic peoples or to help them to gain their independence . 
  * finns just took lands that belong to [ finland ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/92/05/19/9205196afce6189daebc83cbdf830780.jpg ) . 
  they were literally liberating lands form russian occupation . 
   so yes , finland invaded russia and the soviet union , multiple times , the last one being in 1941 . 
  yeah right , after soviet union invaded them without any legitimacy other than expansionism and to bring red terror like they did with lithuania , estonia , latvia , poland and bessarabia . 
  thank god that brave finnish soldiers manage to repel soviets back to their rotten land .

   the last one being in 1941 . 
  after soviet union invaded them without any legitimate reason and murdered their mean , thank god brave finnish soldiers manage to hold off and actually kick soviet ass back to it 's borders . 
  or you know use \u017d\u010c\u0160\u0116 etc. 
  invaded ... yeah right . 
  karelia was inhabited by finns to begin with . 
  and was part of grand duchy of finland within russian empire . 
  so because he 's born as ukrainian he should feel guilty ? 
  like whites should feel guilty in usa ? 
  does n't change the fact that ussr was imperialistic and expansionist machine , one occupation was replaced with another , people were oppressed no matter if it was nazi regime or soviet regime . 
  neither should be praised , since both nazi germany and ussr started ww2 with invasion of poland , both carried out ethnic cleanse , evil is not measured by size , evil will always stay evil .

  learn actual history instead of jerking off on your pro-commie agenda . 
   in 1946 , the nuremberg tribunal declared the waffen-ss to be a criminal organization , making an exception of people who had been forcibly conscripted . 
  throughout the post-war years , the allies would apply this exception to the soldiers of the latvian legion and the estonian legion . 
  the us displaced persons commission in september 1950 declared that : -  '' ** the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states . 
  ** '' -  even before this decision , around 1,000 former latvian legion soldiers had served as guards at the nuremberg tribunal , guarding nazi war criminals . 
  afterwards , during the berlin blockade , they took part in securing allied facilities involved in the berlin airlift and later also were guarding usa army headquarters,

  soviets are invaders of poland , also they ethnically cleansed half of second polish republic 's territory , so please . 
  good for you poland . 
  but this thread is n't about historical map of poland , let alone this is lithuanian by blood dynasty . 
  also * \u0117 * : *, 
  it 's identical to our * j *, 
  un\u017de\u010dpospolite land *, 
  just because it has history does n't mean we should not be allowed to use it given right context . 
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
   finland was n't really soviet friendly . 
   in retrospect it was a stupid move from the soviets because it rallied the entire finnish nation against the ussr , despite many people there being pro-socialist before 1939 . 
  dude what ? 
   it was enough that they let germans use their bases . 
  that was during continuation war , after winter war ( soviet invasion of finland ) was already over . 
   anyway they could have easily joined the german attack in 1941 , who knows . 
  that makes no sense and it is not an excuse for soviet aggression and demanding territories for no reason other than expansionism . 
   hungary and slovakia joined the war despite not having anything to do with the ussr . 
  slovakia was a puppet state of nazi germany and hungary had revanchism in it 's people minds . 
  besides it has nothing to do with hungary or slovakia , we 're talking about finland and ussr , finland after several hundred years of living under other nations finally got it 's independence , you think they would be stupid enough to risk it with war against ussr ? 
   also finland contributed much to the german war effort , though they did n't attack further from their 1939 borders . 
  again that was during continuation war when finland had more than enough reason to hate ussr . 
  i really doubt finland had capacity to invade ussr , though i 'm more than happy to see finnish soldiers fighting off soviet invaders and protecting their homeland from the aggressor even when insanely out numbered . 
   all in all the soviet demands were n't unreasonable . 
  maybe if you 're sovietphile that thinks estonia or finland could possibly invade ussr . 
  [ you failed . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianization_of_lithuania#baptism_of_mindaugas ), 
   and btw the soviet reason for starting the war was finns refusing to exchange their ( very important for the ussr 's defence ) territories around leningrad for much bigger territories north in karelia . 
  [ against whom ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/northern_europe_november_1939.png ) * green - neutral nations * * black - germany and occupied nations * * red - soviet union and occupied territories * * orange - neutral nations with soviet military bases *, 
  as i said , [ pagan swastika ] ( http://www.respublika.lt/uploads/img/catalog/1/photo_for_homepage_1_55945797.jpg ) is nothing new . 
   `` the roots of ukrainian national symbols come from before christian times when yellow and blue prevailed in traditional ceremonies ... '' yeah pretty much same about our flag except green and red . 
   the most solid proof of yellow and blue colours could be traced as far as the battle of grunwald at which participated militia formations from various lands of the polish-lithuanian union . '', 
  til . 
  never change russia . 
  modern russia is just muscovy on steroids that has put russia \u2122 on its face and pretends it 's just revived kievan rus ' . 
  that 's the worst part of russian history too . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rstl7nir7gs ), 
  plus those people were ruthenians not muscovites , such thing as russia did n't exist back then . 
  belarus and ukraine have more legitimate claim on those ruthenian banners than russia . 
  only western europe was liberated .
