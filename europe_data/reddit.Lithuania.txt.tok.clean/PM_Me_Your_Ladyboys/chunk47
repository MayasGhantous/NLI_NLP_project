  yeah , right . 
  like every nationalist would say `` stronger together '' . 
  white european whose mother tongue is french . 
   brussels as the autonomous capital of the eu . 
  we interwar period again boys . 
  comparing forest brothers to bander is pure idiocy . 
  wait are you trying to make this a real thing ? 
  if there is a nation that can be considered half-slav , it 's latvia . 
   `` if today bandera -- the hero and the `` forest brothers '' partisans , which saved the baltic , then what will happen tomorrow ? '' what ? 
  you guys are weird . 
  here is better [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/goymd9a.png ) , broski . 
  you should have posted this [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pvwquor.png ) instead . 
  o \u0161\u016bdas , whole nation of luxenbourg is on me !, 
  * let 's start a war , start a nuclear war , * * at the gay bar , gay bar , gay bar . 
  * * wow !, 
  ( shout out loud ) * * at the gay bar . 
  * ... * i 've got something to put in you , * * i 've got something to put in you , * * i 've got something to put in you , * * at the gay bar , gay bar , gay bar . 
  * * wow !, 
  ( shout out loud ) *, 
   all of us are fucked ... * wink *, 
  not even russia can resist [ the urge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7ej_ngqnrk ) any more , sadly all of them are closet ones . 
  come this way if you 're gay . 
  yep , they 're awesome . 
  [ embrace the potato . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiqqc_fbp1c ), 
  you shall see how swedes made us homogay . 
  [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v9in8gh.jpg ) all of them are crazy ones . 
  i missed a chance , dammit !, 
  do not worry , once you 're in my pow camp , you will be [ treated ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g6k9jbd.jpg ) well by me . 
  i 'll cast my inner half polish ` ness and will do job for you . 
  1920 best day of my life . 
  you clearly meant [ kleinlitauen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuania_minor ) . 
  1939 best day of my life :\\ ^ ), 
  1410 best day of my life . 
  but he 's american spy . 
  this is how [ germans laugh ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c3i6nze.jpg ) . 
  may they rest in piece . 
  the thing is that polish minority is allied with russian minority , if we give you those rights , russians will ask the same , though our russians are far better integrated than those in latvia or estonia , my neighbours and childhood 's best friend are russians . 
  i 'm in favour of giving you those things , but i 'm worried about russian minority creating this shitstorm . 
   because more likely than not eu will break apart in our lifetime okay ... 
  schengen imo is inner eu . 
  well she 's the one that called russia terrorist state due to it 's actions in ukraine . 
  it 's good with bananas , i ate them , damn they were tasty . 
  read my comment again . 
  pretty much , he 's the spark that brings all the tension between lithuanians and polish minority . 
  she 's more of grandma she 's gon na forcefully feed you that 's just first wave of her dishes to you . 
  i do n't see reason for dual citizenship between inner eu members . 
  you practically can live and work in any schengen member state . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y49bnxlfq ) you go buddy , a brief history . 
  polish dog after all : *, 
   de facto something more like federation . 
  yep . 
  every great dictator has to have a good moustache . 
  there was no such thing as grand king , they just referred when writing to pope or someone else as kings of lithuania , ruthenia and samogitia . 
  nope , he 's the only one that actually tried to become officially a king , other than mindaugas of course . 
   dukes , not kings my friend !, 
  lithuanian grand dukes called themselves kings though . 
  what ever you say crazy lady . 
  they really do n't , this [ dude ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valdemar_toma\u0161evski ) does . 
  [ pretty much says whose his master is . 
  at least we did n't end up as [ switzerland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rmuo8g9.jpg ) . 
  oh , damn i clearly meant jam . 
  when i was living in dorms , i often would by these , god damn banana cream so tasty with it . 
  those little poles suppose to be our little poles , but poland stole our little poles . 
  vilnius :d you stole our poles . 
  but it 's it tastes wonderfully , especially during hot summer . 
  weakness disgusts me . 
  interwar . 
  hmm , interesting . 
  hit my plug , that 's my cholo, 
  triggered . 
  there were some [ parts ] ( https://image.prntscr.com/image/vdfl3amdsyqty_f43imrqa.png ) which poland controlled directly . 
  both are good . 
  learn history , thank you . 
   in 1946 , the nuremberg tribunal declared the waffen-ss to be a criminal organization , making an exception of people who had been forcibly conscripted . 
  ** throughout the post-war years , the allies would apply this exception to the soldiers of the latvian legion and the estonian legion ** . 
  the us displaced persons commission in september 1950 declared that :  '' ** the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states ** . '', 
  cut into pieces and boil beetroot , after it gets cold you add milk , cucumbers , boiled eggs , carrots , dill for spices , onions and some parsley also best to eat with boiled potatoes . 
  looks more like poland finally admitting it 's homogay for lithuania . 
  feelslituanianman, 
  iirc poles call it litwoski chlodnik, 
  what the fuck is this monstrosity i just saw . 
  * it 's \u0160altibar\u010ciai you fuck !, 
  * * stop stealing culture !, 
  * edit : for people who are not catching [ reference ] ( https://i.imgur.com/hcf32ns.png ) . 
  gives you 70 's vibe . 
  even non catholics are homophobic af , if i was n't for being old friend they would despise me . 
  not in our . 
  kalavijuo\u010di\u0173 ordinas ( swordmen order ) and later vokie\u010di\u0173 livonijos ordinas ( german livonian order ) is how we call it . 
  autonomous or not , it was still controlled by germans . 
  a wild band of samogitians was enough to beat livonian order to a pulp . 
  pretty sure russian/soviet flag would trigger us more than teutonic order 's flag . 
  eu is the angel and the devil at same time , it boosts our economy growth , but due to open borders people are more keen to leave for western europe , though some of them return once they manage to save a lot of money . 
  if you read some of well known and old polish reddit user posts you would be surprised what they have in mind about baltis , let alone lithuanians , here is an [ example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q06ew5v.png ) . 
  it 's not like our first time . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_uprising https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_uprising, 
   balts were not lithuanians balts were not lithuanians , but lithuanians are balts . 
   lausanne lithuanian informational bureau map what is this map exactly showing ? 
  so you make blatant accusations without having any sources to back it up , that 's an asshole move .
