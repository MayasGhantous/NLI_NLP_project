  i personally know some pro-fascist lithuanians , they literally do n't give two shits about belarus and taking belarusian land is last thing in their mind . 
  do you have sources of such `` great lithuania '' concept ? 
  because as far as i know our nationalists wanted to have nothing to do with belarus , actually it was polish nationalists and soviet russia who was pushing for lithuania-belarus . 
   scientifically it 's called lithuanian irredentism . 
  as oppose to belarusian irredentism ? 
  there are no lithuanian irredentism to begin with , neither do i find any claims to back up existence of lithuanian irredentism . 
  because nobody thought that russia would be back to it 's old roots . 
   the same , not even 1/3 , and it 's not even close to xvi cn . 
  i said western most belarus had lithuanian speakers , are you going to deny it ? 
  i never implied that 1/3 of belarus was speaking lithuanian , but it sure as hell was inhabited by balts before great migration when slavs replaced balts , germanics and romance speakers in specific parts of europe . 
   are you going to post a link to lausanne lithuanian informational bureau map next ? 
  i do n't even know what the fuck are you talking about . 
  there is no such concept as `` great lithuania '' to begin with . 
  it shows where [ lithuanian language ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/etnoregionai.png ) was spoken before germanization of south western lithuania and polonisation of south eastern lithuania . 
  and as i said , it 's a bit exaggerated . 
  this [ map ] ( http://www.truelithuania.com/nuotraukos/lithuaniansxixcenturymap.jpg ) is a bit exaggerating though also this is after ww1 . 
  modern [ map ] ( https://image.ibb.co/id57bq/ethnic_map_of_lithuania2.png ) of lithuanian language ( early xxi c. ), 
   how did western belarus become lithuanian speaking ? 
  i 'm not linguist so i ca n't answer that . 
   was it ethnic lithuanian or belorussian ? 
  your ethnicity depended on father 's heritage when it comes to nobility . 
  if you spoke lithuanian you were ethnically lithuanian , if you spoke ruthenian you were ethnically ruthenian , but then again using such word as ethnicity during medieval times is wrong thing to do , here is an [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) why . 
   are there any parts of belarus that were originally ethnic lithuanian but then got belorussified later ? 
  yes , there are . 
   what does to mean ? 
  short for teutonic order . 
  it 's very vague term to begin with . 
  finland sometimes even poland was in this term . 
  years prior to ww1 lithuania was n't even part of this term and after soviet occupation of baltic states , finland was n't considered a baltic state any more . 
  the term is pretty much used due to modern geopolitics . 
  * the term `` baltic '' stems from the name of the baltic sea -- a hydronym dating back to the 11th century ( adam of bremen mentioned latin : mare balticum ) and earlier . 
  although there are several theories about its origin , most ultimately trace it to indo-european root * bhel meaning white , fair . 
  this meaning is retained in modern baltic languages , where baltas ( in lithuanian ) and balts ( in latvian ) mean `` white '' . 
  however the modern names of the region and the sea , that originate from this root , were not used in either of the two languages prior to the 19th century . 
  lithuanian word for belarus is gudija , but due to soviet occupation , they shoved baltarusija - belarus into our dictionary . 
   when the teutonic knights conquered samogitia , belarus ( and a large portion of ukraine ) was the only remaining region controlled by gd lithuania . 
  gediminas was the lithuanian duke that conquered belarus . 
  eastern ethnic lithuania which was most important core of gdl ( if you wanted to become grand duke you had to be ethnically lithuanian before union of krewo ) was still part of gdl . 
  actually most of [ western most belarus had lithuanian speakers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y5qt965.png ) . 
  given that samogitia was only part of to for 10 years . 
  * [ the forest brothers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers ) ( also brothers of the forest , forest brethren , or forest brotherhood ; estonian : metsavennad , latvian : me\u017ea br\u0101\u013ci , lithuanian : mi\u0161ko broliai ) were estonian , latvian , and lithuanian partisans who waged a guerrilla war against soviet rule during the soviet invasion and occupation of the three baltic states during , and after , world war ii . 
  there was no riga back then . 
  well she 's german , so must be middle eastern / s, 
  pretty sure it 's under lukshenko 's control when lithuanian high ranking officers that go to visit their families in belarus are asked if they would become double agents for money . 
  several years back we caught a spy within our military , not long ago we caught russian spy that tried to implant bug in our presidents office . 
  [ history memes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwz2y_rlama ) , best memes . 
  lukashenko 's border patrols :3, 
  yes you are little bulba , yes you are . 
  your border patrols harass our people when we try to cross the border . 
   exactly . 
  but it 's sensitive subject for today 's lithuanians - all posts about history of belarus is downloaded . 
   but we know the history . 
   greetings from poland to former gdl !, 
  so i guess every historian , history books , articles are all just a sham , you pole know the truth ... laughable . 
  because he 's a nationalist that has to fill his own agenda . 
  and poles with their bad history . 
   plc conquered the principality of kiev ( western rus ' ) from rus ' after the golden horde ( mongol ) invasion of rus ' . 
  it would take another ~ 200 years for plc to be created since lithuania [ finalized conquest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_blue_waters ) of most kievan rus ' from golden horde . 
   when the teutonic knights conquered lithuania proper [ dude what ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/teutonic_order_1410.png/1024px-teutonic_order_1410.png ) they never had control of lithuania proper , only samogitia which is ~ ~ eastern ~ ~ western most ethnographic region of lithuania . 
   gediminas was the lithuanian duke that conquered belarus and most of ukraine . 
  during his rule we only had control of all of belarus . 
  algirdas and vytautas are the ones that conquered the rest . 
  by european standards you 're n. korea : *, 
  man , he 's american , at least he manage to do it right . 
  it 's not hard to google you know ? 
  most likely , it 's alt-history , everything is possible . 
  nothing , just pointing it out ... why so defensive all of the sudden ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's unknown fact for people . 
  most of what is modern belarus used to be inhabited by balts . 
  through late xiii c. till late xviii c. together with them were one country - grand duchy of lithuania , samogitia and ruthenian more commonly known as just g. d. of lithuania . 
  the only thing belarusian cultural thing i know that is in lithuania is potato pancakes . 
  capital is minsk . 
  after ww1 just like us they did n't wanted to see gdl borders being restored . 
  - quite sad that we 're not allied any more . 
  edit : for people that ca n't even google `` most of what is modern belarus used to be inhabited by balts . 
  probably . 
  can you stop apologising ? 
  i really do n't need the sorries , there is no need for sorries . 
  i just pointed out a mistake , you fixed it , but still managed to make hassle out of it . 
  nobody stops you from talking about belarus in this thread about belarus , except you should actually know your sh * t before posting . 
   i saw you pointing mistakes left and right at a rapid speed in this thread i 'm not talking about you . 
  bad history is not a good thing , you know . 
  yelled ? 
  i just pointed out mistake . 
  pretty sure you 're the salty one who is spewing bad history . 
   if you look at the modern map - you can see that todays lithanian land is tiny comparing to former lands of gdl . 
  [ what ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png ) [ what ? 2x ] ( http://i.imgur.com/goymd9a.png )  this bigger part is todays belarus , and big part of former gdl . 
  that 's very stupid logic you know . 
  is mongol empire not mongol empire any more ? 
  british empire , not british any more ? 
   belarusians had big part in former gdl heritage and for me it 's strange that you are trying to deny it . 
  point me out comments where i deny belarusian contribution within gdl ? 
  not even in our history books do we deny ruthenian contribution , i wonder what kind of pot you might be smoking right now . 
   for me they are equal successor of gdl like lithuania . 
  of course they are , that 's why i said you 're telling only half the truth , implying that belarusians are only successors of gdl . 
   and the criterion if language is formal or not is for example fact that it was used for preparing formal documents . 
  every single language was formal , that depended to whom you wrote . 
  peasant did n't write for another peasant .
