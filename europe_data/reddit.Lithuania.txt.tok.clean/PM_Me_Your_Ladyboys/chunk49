   in this criterion , we have many documents prepared in old belarusian and not in lithuanian for example . 
  if you have any - please write about it . 
  also in german , latin , polish , also lithuanian just in cyrillic alphabet before union of lublin . 
  trying to paint ruthenian language as one and only language that was used in medieval lithuania is some next level bad history . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianization_of_lithuania * on the other hand , the conversion to roman catholicism facilitated lithuania 's integration into the cultural sphere of western europe and paved the way to the political alliance of lithuania and poland , finalized as the union of lublin in 1569 . 
  * - i really wonder in what delusional world you live in . 
  [ history of belarus summed up . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uogjv9l.png ) also geography now made a pretty decent video about belarus . 
  you 're using only half truth , while trying to hide your hate towards ethnic lithuanians by hindering our part in gdl existence . 
   it is the people and lands of the former grand duchy of lithuania . 
  belarusians were one of the many inhabitants of multi ethnic gdl . 
   their language was the language officialy used in gdofl . 
  there was no such thing as official language back then . 
  latin , german , french , lithuanian , polish languages were used too in gdl , [ all of them dependent to whom you wrote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_duchy_of_lithuania#languages ) . 
  * in the 13th century , the center of the grand duchy of lithuania was inhabited by a majority that spoke lithuanian , though it was not a written language until the 16th century . 
  in the other parts of the duchy , the majority of the population , including ruthenian nobles and ordinary people , used both spoken and written ruthenian languages . 
  * * the ruthenian language , also called chancery slavonic in its written form , was used to write laws alongside polish , latin and german , but use varied between regions . 
  *  we were once connected in one respublic - rzeczypospolita . 
  yes , i forgot that `` belarusians are converted roman catholics '' . 
  before soviet occupation lithuanians called belarus - [ gudija ] ( http://i.imgur.com/refhodn.jpg ) , sadly it is unknown from where it comes , since lithuanians were the only ones that had different name for the people of belarus . 
  poor trolling mate . 
   there were also other regions that were n't named after colors , ** but had rus in the name ** . 
  black and red rus are split today between ** baltic states ** , what are you even talking about ? 
  he 's one of [ those ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/589cgx/was_medieval_lithuania_actually_the_grand ) , you know . 
  so is a. smetona . 
  by commies and lefties he was considered fascist even though he literally stopped fascist coup from happening . 
  saving lithuania from soviet occupation , after all soviets killed more of our countrymen than nazis . 
  as if lithuania would have made ww2 go different course while allying with nazi germany ... lol, 
   hungary was always the side chick . 
  lithunia was the ~ ~ wife ~ ~ husband . 
  edit : [ context ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_krewo ), 
   it is very ~ ~ polish ~ ~ [ polish-lithuanian * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) to enjoy the misfortune of the neighbor . 
  we have taught you well . 
  :p :p, 
  austrian over-confidence did . 
  no it was n't . 
  russia is the first great power to get involved in austro-hungarian - serbian bitter conflict that meant germany had to fallow up , that meant france had to fallow up , that meant belgium had to be used as parking spot , that meant uk 's involvement . 
  no wonder i have so many polish american friends . 
  ** jk ** i read it as you have no friends . 
   at the time it was undisputed that the ussr had authority in lithuania . 
  you may not agree with it , but they had . 
  lithuania was a `` breakway country '' , but it was still part of the ussr . 
  undisputed ... [ barely any country recognized ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states#list_of_recognition_and_non-recognition_of_annexation ) it . 
  it had de facto control , not de jure . 
   those were violent incidents , not a war . 
  you do n't need war for military confrontation . 
   i mean ... 
  the prague spring was an event on wwii !? 
  i do n't even ... you 're so dense , i do n't even ... where did i tell that it was part of ww2 ? 
  i guess as westerner you do n't get the idea of `` extended ww2 '' which is fine , what would you know about soviet occupation any way . 
   let me ask you a question , is wwii still going on ? 
  you know moscow still has indirect power over transnistria , like it had over the czech republic . 
  by your logic it still going on , right ? 
  no , people in transnistria are still stuck in cold war . 
  i 'm not really a big enthusiast of commie lithuania . 
   how exactly did they repopulate the vilnius region with lithuanians ? 
  * the registered population of vilnius was 107,000 . 
  people who moved to the city during the german occupation , military personnel and temporary residents were not counted . 
  according to the data from the beginning of 1945 , the total population of vilnius , \u0160ven\u010dionys and trakai counties amounted to 325,000 people , half of them poles . 
  about 90 % of the vilnius ' jewish inhabitants had been killed in the holocaust . 
  every pole in the city was forced to register for resettlement and about 80 % of vilnius poles left for poland ... during 1955-1959 period , another 46,600 poles left lithuania . 
  however , lithuanian historians estimate that about 10 percent of people who left for poland were ethnic lithuanians ... 
  while the removal of poles from vilnius was a matter of primary importance for the lithuanian communist authorities , the depolonization of the countryside was limited due to fear that it would cause depopulation and labor shortage . 
  this led to the emergence of the ethnic segregation , with lithuanians and russians prevailing in the city and poles in the surrounding areas . 
  these are the results of the migration to poland and the growth of the city due to industrial development and the soviet union policy . 
  * apparently it was mainly populated by lithuanians through population transferring , but also with some russians , by 1989 vilnius was ~ 50 % lithuanian and ~ 20 % russian while poles ~ 19 % . 
  -  was it as organized and planned as in poland with the western territories ? 
  doubtful , it was soviet idea to keep conquered polish territory at expense of germany 's territory . 
   also i remember lithuania took klaipeda , but then nazi germany took it back , did the soviets expell the lithuanians from klaipeda ? 
  soviets only expelled those that spoke german ( e.g. 
  ethnic germans and prussian-lithuanians ) , 60 % of east prussia had ancestry of balts , all of them assimilated into other western germany 's regions . 
   troops against civilians . 
  is that a military conflict to you ? 
  using armed forces against party that is not recognising your authority says that it 's pretty much conflicting matter . 
   i did . 
  there was no shelling , no gun fights , nothing you may considered a war . 
  except there was [ tanks rolling over civilians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania \\ ) ) , border patrols [ getting assassinated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_omon_assaults_on_lithuanian_border_posts ) . 
   but the war ended many decades before your independence . 
  as i already said , war ended to you , not to us . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prague_spring https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956, 
  which is funny because after polish ultimatum to lithuania ( 1938 ) , which was accepted excluding recognition of vilnius region , lithuanian minority in poland stopped being heavily oppressed only a year later to be fucked by most brutal regimes of xx c. 
  pretty much both germany and ussr recognized vilnius region as part of republic of lithuania before , during and after ww2 . 
  it just fills narrative of enemy of my enemy is my friend . 
  i love [ croat war songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cubcp2wgkyw ) during that time . 
  talking about point of views ... [ here is ours ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4fgv6np.jpg ), 
  because [ poland had different bff ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pzk2iog.jpg ) back then . 
  then again , it was still far from tyrannical rule that of nazis or soviets . 
   together they destroyed a european democracy . 
  poland was not a democracy before invasion of nazi germany and ussr . 
   my point being that lithuania was allowed to be independent without a military conflict , so saying that wwii ended in the 90 's is a very disingenuous statement . 
  [ allowed ... ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/yqfbkjnryn0 ) that 's a dumb word to use for this topic . 
  [ * there was military confrontation * ... okay ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2svhdy23so ) . 
   so saying that wwii ended in the 90 's is a very disingenuous statement . 
  as i said , i might have exaggerated . 
   the scale of the fighting in the balts when wwii was going on and the guerilla fighting afterwards in not even on the same page like you want to paint it . 
  holy fuck , i 'm not comparing anything . 
  i just said war did n't end to us . 
  i get what you 're trying to prove , but germany did not cause ww1 . 
  you did the right thing denying the passage .
