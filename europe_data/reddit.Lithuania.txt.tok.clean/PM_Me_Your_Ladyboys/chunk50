  geographical location played great role in eastern front . 
  one of the reasons why finns manage to hold off against ussr 's invasion and axis forces manage to hold off against red army in [ courland pocket ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/courland_pocket ) till ww2 officially ended . 
  we 're talking about ussr , not japan . 
   you know fairly well that it could have been a complete chaos , with fighting between republic for territory and between ethnic lines , etc. 
  and globally it was handled more or less peacefully . 
  your point being ? 
  i rather not see lithuania to be occupied and annexed by ussr at all . 
   the scale of the fighting is not even comparable . 
  of course scale does n't compare when a tiny nation is fighting second superpower of the world for 9 years . 
  since 40 's till 90 's lithuania was under tyranny , i do n't think we can consider half a century as peaceful times . 
  yes . 
  he 's pretty controversial persona , he was pro-commie , but at same time nationalist , he knew the area will be ethnically cleansed from ethnic germans and prussian-lithuanians at same time will be colonised by russians and almost every structure there was destroyed so it had no value , other than eastern half of it being historically * lithuania minor * - * ma\u017eoji / pr\u016bs\u0173 lietuva * . 
  instead what he did was that after soviets started to ethnically cleanse eastern kresy ( eastern poland ) he focused on vilnius region being populated by lithuanians instead of russians . 
  i doubt , since before and after [ lithuanian-soviet war ( 1918 -- 1919 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) ( that went parallel with [ polish-soviet war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013soviet_war ) and [ polish-lithuanian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_war ) ) always recognized vilnius region as part of republic of lithuania . 
  recognition of vilnius region to republic of lithuania was the only leverage soviets had towards lithuanian populace . 
  given exiled [ lithuanian commie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antanas_snie\u010dkus ) that became leader of lssr was quite a dick waving guy towards kremlin . 
   specially given how the independence of most ex-soviet countries was handled people getting run over by tanks for supporting re-establishing of independence , yeah thanks a lot gorbachev . 
   but comparing `` soviet occupation '' to ww2 period is simply a dishonest statement . 
  i 'm not comparing anything . 
  partisan war ( which is considered one of the most brutal ) kept going for 9 years after ww2 officially ended , population was oppressed under tyranny , forced into submission , young folks during 70 's would self-immolate to protest soviet occupation . 
  i might have exaggerated by saying ww2 ended in early 90 's . 
  staying neutral bit us to the ass and accepting soviet ultimatum was our ultimate mistake . 
  we already gave middle finger to hitler when he offered vilnius region if we invaded poland from north , why did n't we show middle finger to soviets when they offered vilnius region for some military bases against possible attack from nazi germany . 
  try to join axis powers ? 
  if lithuania was n't so butthurt for memelland/klaip \u0117da region and did n't manage to stop pro-fascist ploter augustinas voldemaras , we might have seen lithuania becoming what hitler wanted in molotov-ribbentrop pact - lithuania in nazi influence zone . 
  year later we get fucked in the ass too , sad . 
  how is that not comparable ? 
  if soviets set their foot somewhere , expect them to stay , because in no hell they would know such thing as retreating back to your own borders . 
  for eastern europe ww2 ended in early 90 's . 
   by letting soviets pass through yeah , like that helped baltics to stay independent .

   but finland was an axis power so the allies would ignore it co-belligerent , huge difference . 
   we often talk long and loud about the nazis but i feel that the russians get away way too easy . 
  pretty much . 
  * according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive. , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others .

  eesti , what the hell man . 
  west germany . 
  east germany is n't seen as true germany . 
   and is it really racist when most eastern europeans simply are xenophobic ? 
  [ yeah , i forgot , we 're all racist and should not be allowed to preserve our true europeaness . 
  ironic , you 're just proving how xenophobe you are yourself . 
   orld who we 've historically exploited as well til lithuania was a colonial empire . 
  same about ex-polish-lithuanian commonwealth that existed for 200 ~ years was more than enough for lithuania and poland to make identical in culture sphere , other than language and some pagan traditions we 're identical with poles . 
  honestly , congratulation you made me eurosceptic . 
  who cares . 
  we are just fine here . 
  its cozy and safe  2x, 
   honoring the democratic and binding decisions of the ec was n't a requirement ? 
  as if we 're not taking quota ? 
  2/3 of economic migrants that were relocated to lithuania left for germany first day they came in , quota system is most retarded thing that could possibly be given in this situation , accepting mena people is already idiotic situation . 
  we 're not some fairy promised land for this poverty ridden backward people . 
  honestly i do n't even know why i 'm talking to you , you financially support ngo 's that take part in human trafficking , you make me sick . 
   bitching about it would be comparable to denmark saying it wo n't accept the freedom of movement , because no one warned them about the eastern european workers when they joined in 1973 . 
  good , they can do that i do n't really care , it 's their country not mine . 
  if they think e. euros are endangering their country then they have every right to impose border for e. euros . 
   you are cherry picking your responsibilities and there 's zero rational and legally solid arguments against it . 
  i think rationally , taking mena people who do n't want to be relocated here wo n't solve a problem , actually it will create problems as seen in belgium , germany , france , uk , `` insert any other country that has mena population '' . 
   at least admit that . 
  i will never admit that human trafficking is good , that europe is utopia for poverty ridden backward civilizations and that multiculturism is a good thing , i do n't care if ethnic german , french or portuguese relocates here , their values are not from another dimension that could endanger fellow citizens of my country . 
  go ahead , i could n't care less , i do n't want some backward mena people endangering my countrymen safety . 
  quota is a law now ? 
   poland , which receive some of the most eu funding yet do not want to abide by the rules connected to that money the only thing they 're refusing is quota , which is not a requirement for joining european union , nor receiving funds . 
  what eu does is blackmailing for not being a complete idiot and successfully demonizing eu . 
   i mean if germany has to take the refugees then they should n't have to pay as much money into the pot anymore . 
  or maybe block migrants path towards europe ? 
  which would mean end of quota system . 
  one of the reasons why uk left was because of the migrants . 
   but you ca n't just take take take and expect the eu to give you free money . 
  money they give is not free , they 're invested in infrastructure and other economic areas , which boosts our growth so we would become net contributor in next decade or so . 
  given they 're also benefiting from our membership e.g. 
  work force , i do n't know what 's easier to work with some dude from mena with next dimension values or some dude who is practically same as you . 
   we 're gon na push quotas because you have the same obligation as italy and greece to take refugees in . 
  quotas will not stop migrants flooding europe . 
  first we need to protect eu external border from further ngo 's trafficking illegal migrants . 
  i 'm all for helping italy and greece , but i do n't see how quotas will help them , other than taking some heat , before new wave arrives . 
   hey , good job on reading my flair !, 
  that 's what it is for . 
  you 're biased as i 'm . 
  we took ~ 380 migrants because of quota , ~ 280 ran away to germany as soon as they got `` refugee '' status . 
  given what kind of culture they bring , neither them nor lithuanians wants them here . 
  because you invited them ? 
  i do n't remember that `` taking quotas '' was one of requirement to join eu , if you want to demonize eu and see other countries leaving it , then good job , keep pushing quota . 
  i do n't understand how can some ~ ~ germans ~ ~ kurds be so dense . 
   a good analogy is this : if the eu had a unified soccer team , it would win every cup all the time , but noone would cheer for it . 
  yeah right , as if european football team members are one and same ethnicity . 
   there is no single european nationality , that is the core of defense . 
  i do n't know what kind of comparison are you trying to make . 
  football is football , army is army . 
   i dont think the danish soldier would have the morale to die for the bulgarians sake . 
  who said the membership in eu army will be enforced ? 
  if you do n't want to defend somebody , then do n't expect any one to defend you . 
  both danes and bulgarians must defend each other , because they are part of nato whether you like it or not .
