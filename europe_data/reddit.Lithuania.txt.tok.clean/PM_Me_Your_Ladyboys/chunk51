  that 's what eu army is for , to replace bureaucratic , inefficient army when it comes to securing eu 's borders . 
  downvotes ai n't cool man . 
   danes feel no obligation to defend bulgarians . 
  both bulgaria and denmark are in nato . 
  yes they do . 
   the ottomans were the only ones to not recognize poland 's partition . 
  they did n't recognize it because they had common enemy . 
  it has nothing to do with european unity . 
  other than denying and accusing people you 're not giving any facts that would back up your own claims . 
  so what ? 
  ruthenians used to consider themselves as lithuanians , lithuanians used to consider themselves as poles . 
  before rise of nationalism history of ethnicity did n't mattered , because back then neither you nor any one else considered you as austrians . 
  such thing as austria - osterreich ( eastern kingdom ) was just a domain/realm of different people . 
   do n't conflate hre-times definition of german ( ethnicity & language ) with the modern one ( culture , religion , nationality ) . 
  but you do speak german and you 're culturally connected to bavaria , some would say you 're just lesser bavaria . 
  besides we 're arguing about pre-ww2 and especially pre-rise of nationalism of austrian identity which did n't exist as nationality let alone as an ethnicity . 
  such thing as being austrian only came after end of ww2 , before that you considered yourself german , you even wanted to be united with [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_german-austria ) . 
   the next day , november 12 , the national assembly officially declared german-austria a republic , and named social democrat karl renner as provisional chancellor . 
  on the same day it drafted a provisional constitution that stated that `` german-austria is a democratic republic '' ( article 1 ) and ** `` german-austria is an integral part of the german reich '' ( article 2 ) ** . 
  the latter provision reflected the deputies ' view that felt that austria would lose so much territory in any peace settlement that it would no longer be economically and politically viable as a separate state , and the only course was union with germany . 
  the only reason you were not part of german republic was because allies opposed it . 
   on november 13 , 1918 germany-austria asked germany to start negotiations of union and on november 15 sent a telegram to president wilson to support union of germany and austria . 
  this was grounded in the view that austria had never been a nation in the true sense . 
  while the austrian territory had existed in one form or another for over 700 years within the holy roman empire and later the german confederation , its only unifying force had been the habsburgs . 
  ** apart from being german inhabited , these lands had no common ` austrian ' identity and there had never been an austrian state before . 
  they were habsburg ruled lands that had not joined the prussian dominated german empire after austrian empire lost the austro-prussian war ** . 
   on march 12 , 1919 constituent assembly re-confirmed an earlier declaration that german-austria is a constituent part of the german republic . 
  pan-germans and social democrats supported the union with germany , while christian socialists were less supportive . 
   during spring and summer of 1919 , unity talk meetings between german and austrian representatives continued . 
  all this changed after june 2 , 1919 when the draft peace treaty with austria was presented , which demonstrated that western allies were opposed to the union of germany and austria . 
  but we 're talking about battle of vienna .

  again , comparing belarus and n. korea is like two different worlds . 
  belarus is more like china , live your life , do n't ask regimes legitimacy . 
  it 's easier to identify your views and connect them with your comments .

  i mean c'mon , if you 're not a troll i do n't know how you even survive , you clearly spend money to buy water , food and other commodities disobeying your own views , unless you grow your own veggies , meat idk .

  ironically they too dress like fascists ( black , red , white ) . 
  from all videos of antifa i watched seems like they 're scum of the earth , shoving their rotten ideas to other people and if you disagree with them they start `` reeeee'ing '' as hard as their lungs allow . 
  i meant daily life , belarus is undoubtedly a dictatorship , but it ai n't n. korea . 
  [ relevant . 
  belarus ai n't that bad . 
  are n't they technically acting as fascist ? 
  everything is possible in alt-history either way , speculation is best what we can get . 
  jesus , i would n't want to meet her . 
  neither whites nor reds wanted to give up their claims on former russian empire territories , in order for european borders to be stable germany 's supremacy over continent was must . 
  since central powers would be winning war , there would n't be need of further destabilization of russia by german empire . 
  after ww1 all of eastern half of europe was in chaos for several years because of power vacuum . 
  if most of the continent was united under german control red terror would driven out from both russia and other parts of europe .

  ** scumbags of europe ** : northwestern krai governor general of russian empire * mikhail muravyov-vilensky * aka * hangman of vilnius * - * count [ mikhail nikolayevich muravyov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky ) ( russian : \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u0301\u043b \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044c\u0451\u0432 ; 12 october 1796 , moscow -- 12 september 1866 , saint petersburg ) was a russian imperial statesm\u0430n of the 19th century , most known for his putting down polish uprisings , and subsequent cultural and social depolonization of northwestern krai ( today 's belarus and lithuania ) . 
  he should not be confused with his grandson , mikhail nikolayevich muravyov , who served as russian foreign minister between 1897 and 1900 . 
  * - * during the [ january uprising of 1863 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_uprising ) , muravyov was appointed governor general of [ northwestern krai ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qjjxsfz.jpg ) ( former [ grand duchy of lithuania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7ucvjpa.png ) , now lithuania and part of belarus ) . 
  he managed to promptly subdue the rebellion . 
  about 9000 insurgents were resettled to siberia , 127 were demonstratively hanged . 
  konstanty kalinowski , zygmunt sierakowski and antanas mackevi\u010dius were amongst the rebel leaders executed on his orders . 
  those settlements where the rebels were reported had to pay enormous contributions . 
  as a consequence , for poles and liberal russian circles muravyov became known as the `` hangman of vilnius '' even in modern polish historiography he is sometimes referred to by his contemporary nickname , ` wieszatiel ' ( ` hangman ' ) . 
  to many nationally minded russians , muravyov was a hero and the de facto head of the `` russian party '' . 
  they flooded muravyov with congratulatory telegrams on his nameday , november 8 , 1863 , a form of public expression previously unknown in russia * - * in the long term , muravyov 's policy proved mixed . 
  in 1905 polish rebellion once again took place against russian empire . 
  he was however instrumental in rooting out roman catholicism in belarus , prohibiting construction of new churches and converting the existing ones to eastern orthodox chapels . 
  muravyov justified his russification policies by claiming that polish and lithuanian administration undertook polonization measures . 
  * * opening ceremony of a muravyov memorial in vilnius , 1898 assessment of muravyov 's activity by the educated strata of the russian society varied from enraptured odes by fyodor tyutchev to caustic satires by nikolai nekrasov . 
  after the suppression of the 1863 uprising , the celebrated emigre writer alexander herzen , bitterly joked that muravyov should replace alexander ii on the throne as a more consistent and forceful nationalist . 
  in poland and lithuania he has been viewed as a personification of tsarist repression and russification . 
  oh , did n't see there was a megathread , my bad . 
   lenin was a terrorist . 
  [ pretty much . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uuyvjbh.png )  had the bolsheviks not taken over , russia would today be much better off . 
  both economically and politically . 
  not only that but they would also be a better ally to eastern europe , the anglosphere and the west in general . 
  for that to happen germany needs to win ww1 . 
  imo a hero .
