  about 9000 insurgents were resettled to siberia , 127 were demonstratively hanged . 
  konstanty kalinowski , zygmunt sierakowski and antanas mackevi\u010dius were amongst the rebel leaders executed on his orders . 
  those settlements where the rebels were reported had to pay enormous contributions . 
  as a consequence , for poles and liberal russian circles muravyov became known as the `` hangman of vilnius '' even in modern polish historiography he is sometimes referred to by his contemporary nickname , ` wieszatiel ' ( ` hangman ' ) . 
  to many nationally minded russians , muravyov was a hero and the de facto head of the `` russian party '' . 
  they flooded muravyov with congratulatory telegrams on his nameday , november 8 , 1863 , a form of public expression previously unknown in russia * - * in the long term , muravyov 's policy proved mixed . 
  in 1905 polish rebellion once again took place against russian empire . 
  he was however instrumental in rooting out roman catholicism in belarus , prohibiting construction of new churches and converting the existing ones to eastern orthodox chapels . 
  muravyov justified his russification policies by claiming that polish and lithuanian administration undertook polonization measures . 
  * * opening ceremony of a muravyov memorial in vilnius , 1898 assessment of muravyov 's activity by the educated strata of the russian society varied from enraptured odes by fyodor tyutchev to caustic satires by nikolai nekrasov . 
  after the suppression of the 1863 uprising , the celebrated emigre writer alexander herzen , bitterly joked that muravyov should replace alexander ii on the throne as a more consistent and forceful nationalist . 
  in poland and lithuania he has been viewed as a personification of tsarist repression and russification . 
  [ gott mit uns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ), 
  nice . 
  there is , mostly japanese expat in usa , australia or elsewhere . 
  that 's only half of ethnic lithuania , also they did n't hold it for long , they failed completely to conquer us . 
   alfred rosenberg , minister for the occupied territories in the east , was of the opinion that the balts would become loyal subjects of the german reich and should be allowed to retain their language and autonomy . 
  there was the expectation that `` germanization '' should proceed peacefully , i.e. 
  by enforcing the usage of german language for the higher administration levels and within the ss officer corps . 
  so if russians suffered as much , why are you still praising stalin and red army ? 
  literally walking rape machine . 
  lithuania did not fall under to rule though . 
  `` ever closer union '' . 
  trump might be enemy , usa is not . 
  still we share something that most countries do n't , therefore we 're european . 
   banana republic * an economy dependent upon the exportation of a limited-resource product , e.g. 
  bananas , minerals , etc. 
  typically , the banana republic has a society of stratified social classes , usually a great , poor working class and a ruling-class plutocracy , composed of the business , political , and military elites of that society . 
  * [ says it all . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/russia_export_treemap.png ) let 's not even begin with who runs the country , it 's quite obvious . 
  i assume you instantly gone sceptic about green energy because your country is dependent of natural resource exportation , especially since european market is very important to russia to maintain since it keeps russian economy at stable levels . 
  give barrel a low price and your economy plumps . 
  ^ ^ ^ r ^ ^ e ^ e e, 
  good luck with your banana republic . 
   who has not ? 
  many in the world are pagans still . 
  does that make them european ? 
  most of the world is christian , does that make them european ? 
   as well as half of india and east ( persians and around ) . 
  does not make them any european at all . 
  germanic , slavic , baltic , romance , greek , albanian languages once spoke same language , you know . 
   see above , plus - not true for the finnish , estonian and hungarian - but does not make this countries less european . 
  european is arbitrary term . 
  as i already pointed out about muslim countries in europe , they share one or another link towards other european countries , just like finns , hungarians and estonians do . 
  pretty late given that green energy is priority . 
  should n't that suppose to be eu matter ? 
   christian culture does n't involve just religion . 
  we have pagan cultural celebrations fyi . 
   different not really , we 're all indo-europeans . 
   english one ? 
   indo-european ? 
  i 'm pretty sure you can find out by yourself . 
  culture , people , language . 
  it 's hard to draw europe 's borders , but we all share one link or another . 
  trump at beginning was very sceptic about nato , which worried eastern half of nato members , you know , those that border russia . 
  because of nato alliance , why else you think trump is in poland ? 
  maybe because poland has not much of an affection towards russia as germany does ? 
  christianity is just part of what makes us european . 
  [ nah , i 'm total freak in bedroom . 
   omg thats ten times better and when your `` done '' with the tenciles you can fry them and eat them !, 
  god ... 
  i thought i 'm weird ... 
  there are muslim countries in europe like albania , bosnia and kosovo . 
   free ~ ~ anime ~ ~ ~ ~ hentai ~ ~ tenciles to all !, 
  yes . 
  love me some czechs . 
  [ no , now i 'm into something darker . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/2rvojtj3jxa?t=9 ), 
  bring all the `` my type of grills '' . 
  but i do n't want either . 
  these are only about poles and germans . 
  you can do a search yourself on other nationalities . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_repressions_of_polish_citizens_ ( 1939 -- 1946 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vinnytsia_massacre https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evacuation_of_east_prussia  however , most of the german inhabitants , which then consisted primarily of women , children and old men , did manage to escape the red army as part of the largest exodus of people in human history : `` a population which had stood at 2.2 million in 1940 was reduced to 193,000 at the end of may 1945 . '', 
  first of all lithuanian did n't had waffen ss . 
  secondly these people are nazis that were jailed during interwar period by lithuanian government , memelland/klaip \u0117da region had high concentration of nazi sympathizers . 
  besides we 're talking about latvia and estonia , not lithuania . 
  should i point out belgians in the congo , lithuanian criminals manage to kill thousands , while belgians killed millions . 
   are you really a lithuanian ? 
  afaik pi\u0142sudski is not really liked there . 
  he 's not really liked , but not disputed as one of the last remains of [ polish-lithuanians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) . 
  i 'm worried about italy and greece . 
  nobody in lithuania even cares about commonwealth . 
  when it comes to middle ages it 's always gdl . 
  i still got [ bitched by german ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lc1ju/russia_is_afraid_of_polands_great_power_russian/djswg22/ ) for not making migrants feel like prisoners in lithuania . 
  most of them come to europe for economic reasons , not to integrate of flee war . 
  no , we 're talking about ussr who invaded poland together with nazi germany . 
   not when we have made corpses out of them before , because that is what it will take . 
  why do you think that protecting external eu border means shooting whoever tries to pass it . 
  just confiscate boats , if there are ngo 's jail them , send back people who do n't fit refugee criteria . 
   death sentences for being complicit in crimes against humanity . 
  again , latvians and estonians did neither believe nor knew about holocaust , their main and most important focus was keeping ussr claws from latvian/estonian land . 
   at least they were very good in making the americans believe this . 
  you must be trolling . 
   maritime law - which is international law and supercedes national law - clearly states that shipwrecked people are to be transferred to the authorities in the next port of call . 
  maritime , and especially european law , also superceding italian law , forbids countries to disallow porting a nonmilitary vessel . 
  so that means we should let everyone who were in that ship to stay in europe and give them refugee status even though they come from perfectly safe country ? 
   no , they actually follow maritime law which dictates any vessel to save shipwrecked people . 
  when why do n't ngo 's ship them back to libyan territory and instead ship them to european continent even though they 're far closer to libyan coast ? 
   i am still not seeing any evidence these ngos are actually profitting from their work . 
  do you even read interviews from refugees ?
