  well usa and federal eu would be counter weight for that for sure since both would be 100 % superpowers . 
  until then people of yurop ' like me can only sing : - * i 'm a judeo-christian morality with a greco-roman intellect * * it 's the way we 're short-wired * * it 's a civilising force that demands respect - from the baltic to the straits of gibraltar * * a blue flag gold star sparks a brand new empire * * ours to build , ours the choice *, 
  but , we 're kings of poland !, 
  different times , different structures . 
  even though i agree that poland would most likely control the new-union , i still keen towards federal eu starting with small regional federations . 
  well , if federal eu ever happens , you wo n't be alone . 
   not remotely close to now . 
  which is exactly what i said , poland learned it 's mistake and is not keen to repeat it , that 's why polish government was very supportive of lithuanian re-establishing independence and supporting it towards nato membership . 
  china is not communist any more , imo it 's hyper-capitalist totalitarian state . 
  should we jail them is that what you 're suggesting ? 
  we 're part of eu and schengen area . 
  you need to understand that most of them are economic migrants , they want german size welfare , not lithuanian one . 
  who knows . 
  maybe when poles stop seeing plc as polish empire and lithuanians too stop seeing plc as polish empire , we can start digging the idea . 
  though we 're german/nordic-philes at the moment . 
  [ our ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/jagiellonian.png/800px-jagiellonian.png ) very own habsburg dynasty , too bad at that time we had boat load of civil wars . 
  the thing is your government did n't made same mistake , they instantly approached lithuania with mutual friendship treaty and respecting each others borders . 
  i 'm not saying your government will do something stupid right now , but pis are well unpredictable in my view . 
  yeah we accepted the quota , but ... * of 349 asylum seekers taken in by lithuania , 248 left as soon as they had received official refugee status , according to robertas mikulenas , director of a reception centre in rukla , a small lithuanian town . 
  alienating potential allies just for piece of little land , that mostly involves [ interwar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_polish_coup_d%27\u00e9tat_attempt_in_lithuania ) and [ commonwealth 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberum_veto ) past . 
  you will need [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pzk2iog.jpg ) first to happen . 
  mostly migrant crisis . 
  but yeah , gib more money germoney : *, 
  all those `` beats '' sound awesome , pretty joyful . 
  we can create common \u010c\u0160\u017d empire . 
  okay buddy . 
  exactly my thought . 
  [ yeah , but we 're still training together . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_battlegroup ) even then finland and sweden are quite connected with nato member states , that practically makes them a nato member . 
  yeah , good luck making us anti-german . 
  i love eu , but it 's quite flawed in some fields . 
  the fact that one of the reasons why intermarium failed is because none of the countries that were suppose to be part of it wanted , other than poland and france . 
  yet , lenkiuk , yet . 
  history shows your government is quite capable of doing geopolitically shitty things . 
  since poland was freed from commie regime ? 
  one of the reasons why poland and lithuania did n't instantly go to war again for vilnius region was because poland did n't want to make same mistake again and instead both governments ratified official borders and mutual friendship treaties . 
   anti-german military and economical pact in eastern europe . 
  yeah , good thing we 're not part of it . 
  communism is equal to that of lord voldemort , you do n't talk about it . 
  yeah , but baltics were and still are moving towards different [ direction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ) . 
  [ relevant . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/shwzchf.png ) also [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqcbp4-c5su ) for thread . 
  you can turn on subtitles . 
  i do n't think poland alone can out weight russian or any other countries influence . 
  you would need to restore full commonwealth to be able to be even considered a great power again . 
  lithuania was invited to begin negotiations to join the eu in december 1999 at a european council summit in helsinki and was formally invited to join the eu in december 2002 at a summit in copenhagen . 
  we have maritime border dispute with latvia , but neither government nor people really care . 
  not against catalonia 's wishes and i actually support your side for independence if that 's what people want , but ...  same thing happened with the baltics . 
  [ there is a bit of a difference . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states#list_of_recognition_and_non-recognition_of_annexation ), 
  then maybe instead of attacking just finally point out the difference . 
  people just care that you actually doing sensible things instead of taking illegal migrants without any stopping point . 
  i just wish for a second referendum to be done so you could stay with us . 
  half is more than enough for beginning of federal eu . 
   in regions where winters are colder than snakes can tolerate while remaining active , local species will brumate . 
  unlike hibernation , in which mammals are actually asleep , brumating reptiles are awake but inactive . 
  individual snakes may brumate in burrows , under rock piles , or inside fallen trees , or snakes may aggregate in large numbers at hibernacula . 
  snakes are cold-blooded animals . 
  [ because climate lets them ? 
  ] ( http://www.europe-trips.eu/images/europe-pictures/europe-climate-map.jpg ), 
  i mean seeing snake is one thing , but seeing snake getting it 's skin ripped apart and watching how ants crawl in and out of it 's intestines while it 's still alive quite brutal , especially when you 're a kiddo in summer camp . 
  well we have lipka tatar community , but they look far different from your typical muslim . 
  4 month old acc , with one comment and one thread . 
  very doubtful . 
  it 's a troll acc . 
   italy has summoned austria 's ambassador after the government in vienna announced it was ready to deploy border troops to block any migrant influx . 
  i 'm on austrian side . 
   contrary to calling estonia a baltic state that 's not what i 'm arguing . 
  op called estonians balts , not baltic . 
  through 2 decades i only saw 1 snake that was getting brutally killed by ants because it was near their colony . 
  yes , ireland is british , i know . 
   smells like a wehraboo to me . 
  you would know . 
   oh my god , who the fuck cares . 
  every person whose family was oppressed/murdered by commie regime ? 
  estonians are not balts . 
  go educate yourself first . 
  every far - `` direction '' have dumb people . 
  the first thing that comes into my mind when i see austrian flair , [ i start singing ] ( https://youtu.be/i9hfnljimny?t=34 ) . 
   i kinda doubt that it was only the ethnic lithuanians who ruled belarus at the times of gdl . 
  i mean , you had to be from ethnic lithuanian land ( e.g. 
  have baltic lithuanian blood ) to have a chance in becoming grand duke of lithuania before union of krewo , other than that ruthenian nobility was also part of lithuanian nobility , though in most cases nobles who inherited and ruled rus ' lands would assimilate to local culture . 
   hope you do n't mind belarus having `` pahonia '' as its coat of arms . 
  why would we ? 
  there are many variations of eagles , lions etc. 
  we would be more than happy that you would embrace gdl . 
  < 3  for us it is also a symbol of golden years which has to be returned as soon as belarus leaves russian sphere of influence and gets rid of all that soviet crap . 
  that 's why most nationalistic belarusians ( can i call you gudians ? ), 
  study in vilnius , since in lithuania they can express their common heritage with ethnic lithuania far more than in belarus . 
   theoretically , our common past should make us a bit closer and not divide us . 
  well history is quite complicated , other than some pagan traditions and language we 're quite identical with poland . 
  we were bff 's during medieval times and then biggest enemies during interwar period and now allies again with not much love though ( we look more into germany and nordics ) . 
   you know , modern belarus is just something i 'd rather be ashamed of . 
  well lukeshanko might be an asshole , but he 's not stupid that 's for sure . 
  austria anschlussing germany . 
  now that 's a show i 'd like to see . 
  good thing [ he ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augustinas_voldemaras ) did n't succeed with his pro-fascist coup in lithuania , that would been even darker chapter in our history . 
  yes , ~ ~ bela ~ ~ gudija , let lithuania become ruler of gudija again . 
  i meant anti-bolshevism culture .
