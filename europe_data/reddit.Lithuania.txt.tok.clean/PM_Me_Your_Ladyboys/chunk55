  thanks . 
  probably through latin/french/german chronicles instead that also morphed word into their respective languages . 
  also iirc some english knights were also part of northern crusades so they might brought through their own chronicles . 
  lithuania/lituania sounds nothing like litvanya . 
  litva itself if huge indication of slavicism , because poles were the first ones to obtain and remove several letters from * lietuva * . 
   ah yes , calling me a slut and mocking me and then saying i 'm triggered . 
  god , i thought '' : * '' would more than big indication of sarcasm . 
   your argument is absolutely nothing special . 
  everything you 've said is aplicable to every single european nation , ex-communist and capitalist alike . 
  you do realize i was joking and actually mocking this map too if you actually read my replays to that map . 
  i too was surprised why we 're included as n. european while rest are stuck in e. euro . 
  yeah . 
  po dvylikos ( past twelve ) `` insert minute '' . 
  well unlike you , we lost our independence 95 years prior to this date that map shows . 
  do n't take my comment as offensive , i did n't meant to . 
  and holy macaroni you 're pretty much got triggered . 
  and no , we do n't have significant russian population , our polish minority is bigger than russian one . 
   should be considered to be part of northern europe because of economics and geopolitics ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic-baltic_eight https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_investment_bank https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_council#members https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_battlegroup etc. 
  do some research and you will understand instead of going ape shit on me . 
  in your dreams maybe . 
  yeah , mostly because of that . 
  it 's not in russian , but in old church slavonic which was official language of grand duchy of lithuania due to politics after expansion into ruthenian lands . 
  it 's foreshadowing of joke that belarus is true gdl . 
  yeah , iirc you also have slavic version of lithuania name . 
  yeah , because it travelled from slavic languages to us . 
  good , mr. priesland . 
  we northern now you slut , do n't be jelly ; *, 
  fun fact , old lithuanian did n't had * f * sound , that 's why it 's written as pranc\u016bzija and not franc\u016bzija . 
  karolis . 
  - fun fact , lithuanian word for * king * is * karalius * which was made from * charles the great * name . 
  we can always make a union . 
  one word , boosting an agenda of foreign enemy . 
  just like russia does , every wannabe dictatorship needs it . 
  [ some of us did liked that culture ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4fgv6np.jpg ), 
  and you 're getting this from ? 
  yeah , that 's the only thing russia got going , chauvinistic history of the past . 
   based on palemonids legend from lithuanian chronicles . 
  i assume it should be well-known in lithuania . 
  as far as i know it is not , because by reading it you can understand it 's total non sense and not worth being of being included in history books . 
  given the language they spoke , not disputed at all . 
  assimilated to poles ( western slavs ) not to ruthenians ( eastern slavs ) . 
  one of the worst times of our history . 
   moreover , they considered nobility origins as latin where are you basing this from ? 
  vilnius was always a multi-cultural city , not only lithuanians , poles and ruthenians lived in it , but also jews , mongols , turkics even germans , who were invited by grand duke most of our medieval castles are teutonic type of castles because they were built by teutonic stone builders . 
  lithuanians still [ inhabited far wider ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jbse6ii.jpg ) area than today , russification is what made polonisation more attractive towards peasant population of eastern lithuania , while western lithuania was naturally more rebelling and higher concentration of nobility due to teutonic and lithuanian fight over it which made christianity unattractive to them . 
  the lithuanian lands did n't assimilate to slavs , only lithuanians that ruled east slavic realms did . 
  lithuanian nobility ruled gdl , ruthenian nobility joined lithuanian nobility after lithuanian massive expansion . 
  you had to be from ethnic lithuanian lands to even have chance in becoming grand duke of lithuania before union of krewo . 
  that 's indeed true that many lithuanians assimilated to local culture but i doubt they ever stopped considering themselves lithuanians , let alone separate from lithuanian nobility . 
   as early as the 16th century , several ruthenian noble families began to call themselves gente ruthenus , natione lithuanus . 
   a good example is the chodkiewicz family , which attributed its ancestry to the house of gediminas . 
  horrible to even think about it . 
  that 's a dick move . 
  saying it was turkic empire is wrong . 
  you should n't put modern ethnicities to ancient empires . 
  that 's quite strange . 
  ruling class of grand duchy of lithuania was lithuanian , but most of it 's territory and population were eastern slavs , does that make lithuania and slavic state ? 
  i think we should n't add ethnicity to old empires at all . 
  improting russian colonists , of course population will grow , ussr empire falling , of course russians will flee back to russia . 
  no , it 's that hungary has far more in common with germany than with bulgaria or russia . 
   central europe according to p. jones ( leibniz institute for regional geography ) . 
  many central european countries and regions were part of the german and austro-hungarian empires and the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth and thus share common cultural and historical connections . 
  [ just sweden doing it 's thing . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ), 
  yeah , but baltics are shown as n. european , i just wonder why , since rest are shown as eastern . 
  not that i 'm complaining , but map looks less legit than it should be . 
  finland part of ussr , wut mate ? 
  [ swedish dreams of ruling baltic sea never die . 
  :p ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ), 
   ma\u017eeiki\u0173 nafta , discrymination of polish minority how exactly ? 
   your independence is mean not goal for us . 
  it is better to fight in lithuania then poland but when fighting could be more favorable for us in poland pragmatism is a way to go . 
  yeah , yeah , yeah , no need to cry a rivers here buddy . 
   no reason to wasted soldiers and equipment in uphill battles for which we receive only `` shitty gratitude '' . 
  god , you still have n't got it , did you ? 
  past times are not the same as modern times . 
  we 're more than happy being ally of poland today , you really need to stop victimising yourself , for real . 
  i volunteering to the army and will start my duty in few months . 
  i would die for the last pole as i would die for the last lithuanian . 
   lol , lithuania will expel us ? 
  where did you see me write that we will expel you ? 
  if you do n't want to defend lithuania you 're free to leave nato . 
   poles are megalomaniacs , looks like you were too long with us in one state . 
  you 're biasing this on what ? 
  unlike poland we did n't want to restore `` old empire '' , unlike poland we did n't attack almost every single neighbour , unlike poland we did n't give promises of independence to ukraine and belarus just to back stab them in the end , unlike poland we did n't plan coups in foreign nations etc. 
  you do know hitler suggested us to invade poland from north to regain vilnius region and that we refused that offer , instead we took many polish civilians and military personal as refugees , even though you threatened with invasion if we did n't re-establish diplomatic relations . 
  get off your high horse , holy shit . 
  maybe fix your corruption first so foreigners would be more keen to invest . 
   if you 're ex su but now in the eu you 're probably very happy because the eu has been funnelling shit loads of investment into your country to ensure you `` look west '' they invest to have rich and stable neighbours . 
   fair enough , we should be less romantic and more pragmatic . 
  past has nothing to do with modern times . 
   taking into an account your attitude and more recent treatment of polish actors in lithuania what are you talking about ? 
   we should not interfere with your independence in coming war with russia . 
  you wo n't , your government and army will , it 's polish geopolitical goal to keep lithuania independent whether you like it or not . 
   we got nothing to gain and you do n't want our involvement in your relation with moscow . 
  lesson learned . 
  then you 're free to leave nato and eu , good luck . 
  yeah , but good luck on not losing them when doing sports or being in an army .
