   if they can somehow prove getting a womb is a medical necessity they should get one . 
  body dysmorphic disorder is a thing . 
  that 's what psychiatrist are for , you need to go through boat load of therapies before you 're allowed to begin transformation . 
   involved in any more than if i want to get laser eye surgery . 
  given what job you have would n't you having better eyesight benefit society ? 
   us like janusz `` traitor '' radziwi\u0142\u0142 ? 
  to you he 's traitor , to us realpolitik . 
   considering that deluge was as devastating for gd as for crown do you really prefer barbaric swedes over `` peaceful '' poles ? 
  of course not , my own town was devastated by northern wars which were started by poles . 
  i rather prefer to not be attached to either . 
   but more seriously , do you think lituanians would have better position in union with sweden then in plc , why ? 
  this is alt-history , everything is possible , but given actual history it was a shitty deal sticking with you . 
   it was signed as effect of lithuania being conquered by sweden , i know that russian threat was real but was it really worth it ? 
  the only reason we ever entered union with poland was due to moscovites growing power , it should be an no brainer we would side with next country that could help us against russia in future . 
  who said all their operations are covered by other peoples money ? 
  what if something happens to you and you need an operation , why should my tax money be wasted on you ? 
  that 's pretty self centric , i can say same , that my taxes should n't go to you , but to me and only to me instead . 
  medicine is improving as time goes on . 
  you 're actually half right , they should pay for this kind of operation on their own , but then again not only transgenders would have a need of possible transplants that would cost a lot of money . 
  most transgenders i know have money problem because of how much money every operation cost , especially when psychiatrists force them to stay 24/7 on several pills to keep their mental health in `` good shape '' , it 's money sucking experience . 
  does n't mean they stop paying taxes ... 
  or you know esperanto . 
  pretty much same opinion as yours . 
  you do know , that transgender is also paying taxes ? 
  nice .

  do n't say sorry for him . 
  i know him and i know his style of comments , it feels like he 's just a sub-acc of one guy , those several accs always have identical opinions and writing style . 
   however , if you think our right-wing wackos ca n't actually invent anything more retarded , sorry to say , you ai n't seen nothin ' yet . 
  this is hilarious . 
  honhon is how french laugh . 
  ethnic cleansing is ethnic cleansing . 
  i rather prefer union with prussia . 
  both keep each other alive . 
  yes ? 
   a bunch of hipsters who considered the polish culture to be way too mainstream for them , ** invented another culture for themselves ** basing it on purposefuly making all possible aspects of it the opposite of the polish one , while borrowing vocabulary from minor peasant dialects of samogitia and auksztota . 
  much to the surprise of the better part of inhabitants of former grand duchy , that group started to call themselves `` lithuanians '' . 
  man you ca n't write more retarded sentences than that can you ? 
   you are more russified than you think you do n't even know what the term means . 
   for example poland and italy are two completely different countries . 
  people look different , act different ... 
  political environment is different . 
  architecture is different . 
  dating habits are different . 
  even entertainment culture is different . 
  poles try to get drunk as fast as possible and start rubbing each other in clubs while italians are slow eaters and drinkers . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  european countries are unique of course , but comparing them to let say turkey , japan , india , iran makes them more similar than different .

  nothing weird in it , two different worlds . 
  i 'm not against mutual cooperation in modern times . 
  just do n't expect people to see plc as golden age as you do . 
   do you find muscovy rise as good outcome for lithuania ? 
  it was poland fault ? 
  you made your bed deal with fallout . 
  why do you assume things that i do n't say ? 
  can you please stop . 
  of course it was not good . 
  stop being so defensive and insecure over not wanting to have anything to do with poland . 
   regarding sweden , nice idea . 
  why lithuania did n't gone that way ? 
  because it was easier to expand into devastated ruthenian lands , than destroying both livonian and teutonic orders , also [ you prevented us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) ? 
   i admire plc i neither show admiration nor hatred . 
   during union of lublin gd requested polish help agains muscovy invasion . 
  i 'm not denying historical fact that the only reason we went for union was because of losing wars against muscovy . 
  -  you were asking for help , had your dynasty on our throne and starting positions was similar for you and us . 
  which is the problem , polish nobility intentionally prevented lithuania from being independent from polish crown . 
  * there was an attempt by grand duke vytautas the great ( ruled 1392 -- 1430 ) to receive the royal crown . 
  as discussed at the [ congress of lutsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_lutsk ) , he was proclaimed king , and lithuania a kingdom , by sigismund , holy roman emperor , in 1430 , but the royal crown , which was sent by sigismund to vytautas , was intercepted by polish noblemen . 
  soon afterwards vytautas died , without being crowned as king . 
  * -  could you describe what was optimum solution for you ? 
  [ already did . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6kmn9a/happy_448th_birthday_polishlithuanian_commonwealth/djnbgvf/ ), 
  i expect union with sweden to happen , it was their geopolitical goal after all to rule whole baltic sea . 
  besides muscovy would n't have risen if gdl did n't kick golden horde from ex-kievan rus ' lands . 
  poland was also still fragmented when lithuania started to consolidate , we had time and opportunity . 
   lithanians had jagiellons on polish throne , yet they complain about polonisation . 
  hardcore polonization actually happened [ after napoleonic wars ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jbse6ii.jpg ) , when russia started russification . 
   they had opportunity which they did n't seized . 
  lithuania consolidated and christianized far later than poland , it should be non-brainer we would have to adopt polish customs in order to look more western . 
  besides during that time we had a lot of [ civil wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_civil_war ) . 
   from my pov russification is cancer but i 'm biased both polonization and russification was cancer for lithuanian nation . 
  i never said i preferred russian rule , i said i preferred if poland and russia kept their nose in their borders . 
  what 's your point ?
