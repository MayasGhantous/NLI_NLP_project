  i rather prefer kingdom of lithuania to not expand east and instead re-conquer latvian/estonian ( livonian ) and prussian lands . 
  incorporation of slavic lands was huge mistakes for national state hood , sad thing such thing did n't exist back then . 
  not really much of a celebration . 
  i doubt sweden or norway celebrate their `` unions '' . 
   they may not like outcome but it is hard to blame crown for that . 
  as if crown was n't the one that made state fall with their liberum veto and elective monarchy . 
   lithuania had to choose to be enslaved by muscovy or create quite powerful state . 
  be russified or be polonized , you mean ? 
  how are they 're not european ? 
  are basques not european in your eyes just because they do n't belong to indo-european language tree ? 
  do you even know about genetics ? 
  finno-ugrics inhabited north eastern europe long before indo-european even started to spread through europe . 
  i can smell your butthurt for not being included as european . 
  that turkey is not european . 
  while estonia and finland are 100 % european . 
  it was one of they key factors for being european descendent . 
  hope you 're trolling . 
  religion always boosted cultural conservatism ? 
  [ are you sure you 're ready for this ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/x7ej_ngqnrk ), 
  why would you need one ? 
  it has more to do with religion . 
  kinda dull . 
   ah yes , the evil soviet propaganda . 
  man everytime , every issue , whatever it is , you blame the soviets . 
  you 're telling soviets were n't masters of hiding soviet crimes ? 
   just like stalin stalin is not controversial figure in lithuania , he 's stands in same place as hitler does . 
  he was part of anti-nacism underground fighter group too since 42 's . 
  he 's neither big , nor important figure , he does n't have million of innocent lives under his belt either . 
  nobody in lithuania is celebrating him . 
  the only thing he ordered was relocation of ~ 300 jews from one ghetto to another , after german soldiers came they were ones that actually killed part of the relocation group , so most likely it was n't noreika 's orders , also soviet propaganda painted him as jew killer after that so there is even more doubt about it . 
  it 's controversial and vague figure , unlike stalin , whose sole intention was to kill whoever he deemed risky to be left alive , even if it meant children or women . 
  the article pretty much exaggerated him . 
  show me where lithuanians are celebrating waffen-ss . 
   they fought against ebil russkies so they must be good since russkies are bad . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_the_baltic_states_ ( 1940 ) maybe learn history . 
  the reality is that russia still stuck between * them vs us * when it comes to mentality . 
  if you want to find cause of the problem , you only need to look into a mirror . 
  there were several actual democracies in europe back then . 
  bro , it 's [ vytis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvtr0exfm0y ) . 
  [ teutonic order ] ( https://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png ) were our biggest nemesis before russia was born . 
   there are knights on horses and `` lietuva '' , so presumed they were teutonic knights ? 
  you surely need to read more about [ northern crusades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades#prussia_and_lithuania ) , before assuming something like that . 
  you can have opinion and express it , does n't mean it will be right . 
   though most of people here do know everything about 140 millons of russians  no we do n't , we share neither cultural not geopolitical similarities , it should be a non-brainer to know that we 're not one and the same . 
   would you agree that we have more ... let 's name it relaxedness opposed to the latvian-german ` ordnung ' ? 
  [ no , we do n't . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg/683px-grossgliederung_europas-en.svg.png ) germany and nordic countries are primary countries we look to be like . 
  especially since soviet-lithuanian war . 
  we came out far more successful than under commie regime . 
  so they are now representation of whole lithuanian nation state ? 
  and that style of life would be ? 
  i guess you know how every 3 million lithuanian live . 
  yes , it should be destroyed . 
   ussr had more accessible education and health care for example . 
  as if capitalistic countries do n't have ? 
  like i do n't know canada ? 
   `` turning backs on commiunism '' have n't shown any good results yet . 
  for us it did . 
  russia just fails at everything , that 's the problem . 
   read once again , please . 
  it 's sign . 
  effect of . 
  that still does n't make it '' * all lot in common * '' . 
  alcoholism is not specific to russia or lithuania . 
   btw my wife is half lithuanian . 
  so grandfather of my children is 100 % lithuanian . 
  lives in klaipeda now , used to live in kaunas . 
  american way of i 'm 1/4 irish , just because your children have lithuanian blood in them does n't mean russia and lithuania are now geopolitically and culturally connected . 
  besides different nationalities marrying each other is not '' * a lot in common * '' . 
  stop trying to find '' * a lot in common * '' you barely got any . 
   though maybe he is not 100 % from your point of view . 
  because he is ` zhmud ' . 
   that 's ultra nationalistic polish view , not lithuanian . 
  and that 's your definition of * a lot in common * ? 
  comment on what ? 
  can you repeat that for me please . 
  much of strawman ? 
  embrace it , let me give you the necessary ambrosia . 
  i see no argument other than `` lalalalala you ai n't n. european '' .

  not only un , but many other org . 
  if you feel it 's `` bs '' ; `` injustice '' then send a latter and bitch about it to them , instead of spamming `` you 're not n. european , because i said so ! '' . 
   you can put your fingers in your years and sing `` lalala '' and it still wo n't make it true , whatever the un said . 
  that 's exactly what you 're doing right now , i show you facts that classifies us n. european and you just put your fingers over your ears and sing `` lalalalalala '' , pretty funny actually . 
   lithuania is not northern europe . 
  umm , yes we are . 
   it 's a geographical stretch at best . 
  how is that stretch ? 
  we 're as much if not more in north of denmark and in west than finland . 
   you can not make lithuania a northern country without having to change the geographical definition of other countries as well . 
  i 'm pretty sure you can , which un and many other org . 
  did . 
  japan is a ww2 loser and was nuked twice . 
  they got same military treatment as germany did . 
  and usa actually rebuilt the country to make sure it does n't succumb to communism . 
  you can not agree as much as you want , facts are facts , we 're geopolitically connected with northern countries and are considered as one , if it was n't for soviet occupation we might as well already [ been considered northern european countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ) . 
  and that would be ?
