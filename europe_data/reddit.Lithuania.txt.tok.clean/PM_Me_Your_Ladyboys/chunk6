  modern danish-swede rivalry is just cute throw of banters at each other . 
  yeah i forgot that bulgars actually mixed with local population . 
  no , but praising ussr , that 's only a retard would do , just like praising nazi germany . 
  euromonies , tolerance , happiness . 
  in history books its seen as just history , not bad , not good , literally middle ground . 
  do n't you want euromonies , do n't you want to go homogay with me ? 
  what does it mean ? 
  szlachta 's privileges which lithuanian nobility did n't had . 
  technically he 's right , both poland and lithuania had first constitution in europe , second oldest ( after usa 's one ) in the world . 
   eu4 it was called commnowealthball you clearly wanted to say commonblob . 
  accept grybauskaite as your rightful king . 
   you get whitewashed in western media because you `` switched sides '' after 1991but dont delude yourself . 
  the ussr had every right to occupy eastern europe . 
  some man killed your dog and got shot/punished , but for some reason you now you have a right to live in my house , eat my food , kill my dog and kick me out into a street ? 
  you taking a piss ? 
  i ca n't handle stupidity of russian who praise ussr . 
  they starved their own people before ww2 . 
  for baltics soviets come off worse than nazis , you should know that at least . 
  during first soviet occupation of lithuania . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainiai_massacre  the rainiai massacre ( lithuanian : raini\u0173 \u017eudyn\u0117s ) was the mass murder of between 70 and 80 lithuanian political prisoners by the nkvd , with help from the red army , in a forest near tel\u0161iai , lithuania , during the night of june 24 -- 25 , 1941 . 
  it was one of many similar massacres carried out by soviet forces in lithuania , and other parts of the ussr , during june 1941 . 
  several thousand people were killed in these massacres . 
  the rainiai massacre was far from the largest of these massacres , but it is one of the best-known , due to the brutality and tortures inflicted on the victims by the perpetrators . 
  similar atrocities were committed in other places , like the tartu massacre , in which almost two hundred and fifty people were murdered . 
  -  according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  we can make you grand ' again . 
   just say three words . 
  what do you mean ? 
  pretty much triggered . 
  technically speaking you 're right . 
  modern bulgarians are mix of bulgars and slavs . 
  prussians were half balts who unified germany , therefore we 're all lithuanians since lithuania was unified baltic ( white ) state . 
  for some reason we can relate to this bs , thank god belarus does n't do this on state level . 
  if there is one nation we do n't talk shit about and want to improve relations , it 's ~ ~ belarus ~ ~ gudija .

  \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af we wanted to break union , that was our chance . 
  you cheated us with swedes too . 
  stupid sexy swedes . 
  there would have been lithuania , but probably no belarus . 
  poland and lithuania needed each other because teutonic order was our enemy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_lutsk  the main aim of the council , a defense strategy to protect europe from the ottoman turks , was not achieved because the congress was dominated by another event . 
  king sigismund of luxemburg encouraged the crowning of vytautas as king of lithuania . 
  he was interested in dividing lithuania and poland , with a separate kingdom of lithuania , to reduce the influence of poland . 
  and after glolden horde , former enemy , now ally of g.d. of lithuania was destroyed by muscovites , which meant fast growth of proto-russia ( g.p. 
  of moscovites into tsardom of russia ) so lithuania needed strong ally too . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_lithuanians#/media/file:wilhelm1.jpg ) either annex whole baltics or go home . 
  russia is worst empire to be part of . 
  well , it was n't good for national/ethnic lithuania . 
  they did it for a good reason though , which poland tried hardest to happen . 
  poor trolling mate .

  he 's one of those retarded people . 
  [ or not over extending and let russia bleed out like they did in ww1 . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ruetmrjbkwi?t=158 ), 
  rip o.g lithuania . 
  [ what actually happened ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dqj78j4.png ), 
  1610 best year of my life . 
   if sweden invade poland again then ~ ~ poland ~ ~ lithuania can into nordic . 
  [ union of k\u0117dainiai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k%c4%97dainiai ), 
  red army was not a good guy . 
  then do n't cry and ignore it . 
  iron curtain was never a good thing . 
  he really hates plc , looking at his comment . 
  i would n't bother to argue with him . 
  you know nothing about early plc. 
  maybe , gdl was biggest state in europe during xv c. 
  invade russia if you want that . 
  plus litwa still has ptsd from last time . 
  lithuania had access to the black sea before union , but lost it . 
  there was no estonia back then , only livonia , we controlled much of livonia . 
  there are far nicer maps of plc , why use this one . 
  jesus , do you really blind to jokes ? 
  where the fuck do you want me to pull off statistics from xviii century . 
  the city was massacred , pleague , fire took over , while jews , poles and polonized ruthenians were replacing original inhabitants to recover population losses . 
  during partitions vilnius still manage to come out as 3rd largest city . 
  next time be succesful with your union , so we could escape that damn polish influence and not be partitioned together with them !!!!!!, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vilnius#polish.e2.80.93lithuanian_commonwealth  the 17th century brought a number of setbacks . 
  the commonwealth was involved in a series of wars , collectively known as the deluge . 
  during the russo-polish war ( 1654 -- 1667 ) , vilnius was occupied by russian forces ; it was pillaged and burned , and its population was massacred . 
  during the great northern war it was looted by the swedish army . 
  an outbreak of bubonic plague in 1710 killed about 35,000 residents ; devastating fires occurred in 1715 , 1737 , 1741 , 1748 , and 1749 . 
  the city 's growth lost its momentum for many years, 
  lol, 
  mongol , japanese , chinese etc. 
  empires were all nice and dandy ? 
  man you 're retarded . 
  nobody forced them to adapt to polish customs . 
  it was a natural process , lol , you cant be serious . 
  did i say they were forced to ? 
  i said they had to in order to have higher standing in society when looking at other countries . 
  since poland was kingdom while lithuania was just grand duchy . 
   they were acting in the name and on orders of jagie\u0142\u0142o . 
  you can not possibly think that jagie\u0142\u0142o himself stopped envoyes . 
  then it 's purely biased on poles . 
   also the royal crown was given to witold in exchange of anti-polish alliance with emperor . 
  no surprise , we wanted to break union with you once an for all . 
   moreover the coronation was against the will of the pope , it was a emperor 's idea , and in the end lithuania would n't became `` independent '' but subjected to german emperor , just like kings of czechia . 
  - i wish he succeeded . 
    the main aim of the council , a defense strategy to protect europe from the ottoman turks , was not achieved because the congress was dominated by another event . 
  king sigismund of luxemburg encouraged the crowning of vytautas as king of lithuania .
