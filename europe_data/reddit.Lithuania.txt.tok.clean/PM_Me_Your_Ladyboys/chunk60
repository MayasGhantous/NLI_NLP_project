   before christianity , europe was literally a bunch of tribes killing eachother with clubs and sharp sticks . 
  you clearly do n't know anything about pagan european culture . 
   i 'm not saying christianity civilized europe , but the mediterreanean did .

  shut up mini-europe .

  poof . 
   go to spain or poland and tell the people there that abrahamic religions are irrelevant to european civilization ; in modern times it is irrelevant .

  money did n't exist , vouchers did .

  axe wo n't do much once impaled by a spear that is coming 70 km/h . 
  [ when i see poland-lithuania . 
  it 's utopia on paper , rotten apple in reality . 
  mhm , okay , your communism was never tested , i get it . 
  okay buddy , i believe in you . 
  oh yeah , i forgot how everyone in europe especially states that experienced it loves communism . 
  and what will that achieve ? 
  maybe i do n't want to have children yet ? 
  space is marvellous place . 
   in which days ? 
  latvia was never richer than france according your own source . 
  the only western country it passes is austria in 1938 , which is very probably an effect of the german annexation that same year . 
  richer than finland . 
  gdp practically doubled past 9 years ( 1929-1938 ) for latvia coming close to france and other states . 
  surely we were n't surpassing everyone at instant , but surely we were moving towards it . 
  there is a reason baltic were subsidizing all of ussr and were richest parts of it . 
  plus we were [ moving towards nordic countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ) together with finland . 
   latvia and lithuania spend 1.0 % and 1.1 % of their gdp in military , which is pretty low even for eu standards . 
  this is 2015 source , lithuania now spends 1,9 % of gdp since 2017 . 
  lithuania is increasing military spending and by 2020 should be beyond 2 % thresh hold . 
  keep up with the times . 
   whenever this topic comes up eastern europe shouts we have to strengthen eu borders while it blocks any talks about fair distribution of refugees . 
  meanwhile southern / western europe is pushing for redistribution while seemingly way less concerned about securing our borders . 
  we can agree on both . 
  shut down migrant route , start distributing refugees and sending back economic migrants . 
   if we leave italy , greece etc. 
  alone with this massive problem they will just encourage these people to go north as they have already done in recent years . 
  i never said leave them alone , contrary , i want eu navy to be as much a thing as eu army is going to be , to help them protect their external maritime border . 
  do n't mind me just taking my mods out for a walk . 
  penis joke . 
  [ technically speaking you 're right . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/baltic_drainage_basins_%28catchment_area%29.svg/516px-baltic_drainage_basins_%28catchment_area%29.svg.png ) [ but term baltic is quite specific . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_states#etymology_and_history ) before ww1 , neither lithuania nor finland was considered baltic country . 
  that depends on a country , latvia was as rich as france back in the days . 
  richer than austria . 
  let 's not even begin how much more we spent percentage of our gdp on military . 
  those are nordics . 
  finland used to be included in baltic definition but after ww2 it became synonym to soviet occupied neutral baltic states . 
  [ who knows ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ) , maybe if we were n't occupied by ussr , we might taken same direction as finland did . 
  because they were n't occupied by ussr and did n't have enforced communism for 50 years to come . 
  our economies are still recovering . 
   ** baltics ** + germany are destination for them .
