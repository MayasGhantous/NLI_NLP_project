  back then countries were still colonial powers . 
  interconnected economy that makes war neither practical nor feasible between european states is what made this continent stable . 
  i do n't disagree with advances , i disagree with the beginning of european growth in scientific field more than the rest of the world . 
   you mean nazi germany , of course . 
  [ also nazi germany . 
  let 's not forget that ussr and nazi germany greeted each other in middle of poland and made a parade .

  can you show me the quotes on that ? 
  i can [ quote myself ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fkcf8/today_73_years_ago_was_the_dday_in_normandy/diizzsp/ ) if you 're too lazy . 
  dude , we can agree to disagree . 
  industrial revolution involves economic growth , not growth in scientific field . 
  same here .

  right after ussr invaded poland without declaration of war . 
  nice . 
  60 years ago french and germans were cutting each others throats , now they 're best buddies . 
  times change . 
  ussr was never peaceful , through 1945-1956 partisan war against ussr occupation , through 70 's people would self-immolate to protest soviet occupation etc. 
  that all happened just in lithuania . 
  unification talks when ? 
  i 'd prefer [ european way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ) of being patriotic .

  well , i mean , during interwar we actually had an army that could withstand soviet invasion , until soviets would realize that they would need to send more red roaches just like they did with finland , sadly we did not had favourable geographical location so we would have fallen either way .

  yeah right , keep dreaming .

  ironic words from uk . 
  belarus ? 
  no , they never revolted in their whole history under foreign nations ( xii - xx c. ) - golden horde ( mongol empire ) , grand duchy of lithuania , polish-lithuanian commonwealth , russian empire , ussr . 
  people are pro eu . 
  government is populist . 
  great come back . 
  japan are on their way . 
  or australia , they 're already in eurovision . 
  can you help us with belarus ? 
   till this day it 's a mostly banned topic in the follow-up state . 
  people feel like criticizing ussr is a taboo because they saved us from nazism ... 
  so many war crimes were covered by ussr through all cold war , that people forgot it was second most evil regime in human history . 
  this sounds metal af . 
  we will make those worthless provinces into great potato-economy . 
  but that 's jogaila not vytautas , he wanted to rule both crown of kingdom of poland and grand duchy of lithuania . 
  to rebuild prussia you will need to extract baltic ancestry from lithuanians/latvians and infuse it with german discipline . 
  baby steps .

  [ time to reclaim what was once ours !, 
  more commonly known as northern part of eastern prussia or lithuania minor . 
  though nothing of prussian or prussian-lithuanian left there after ww2 . 
  nothing of prussian left there , it 's fully kaliningrad oblast now . 
  there are more english speakers in usa and china than in uk any way . 
  it does n't matter , it 's de facto international language . 
  1410 best day of my life . 
  thanks . 
  and what country are you from ? 
  nope , they need to also use polish minority in order to have even a bit of influence in lithuanian politics . 
  not hard to google , bro . 
  the first thing soviets did after obtaining power is ending participation in ww1 ...
