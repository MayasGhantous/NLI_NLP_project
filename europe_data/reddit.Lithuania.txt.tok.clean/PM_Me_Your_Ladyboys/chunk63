  given that sweden is closely allied with nato means we have gotland in our hand , therefore control of baltic sea . 
  just leave it , they see only white and black .

  i have no doubt that crimeans support russian annexation . 
  i do not support illegal way of taking it from ukraine . 
  you have no idea what stockholm syndrome is then . 
  for you :  is a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity . 
  i do n't see how nato is holding lithuania as hostage . 
  twangste , old prussians true prussians . 
  hhahahaha , what great joke ... not . 
  dude , they wanted us since [ northern crusades ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/teutonic_order_1260.png/1024px-teutonic_order_1260.png ) , step in a line . 
  that was against jews and political opposition . 
  nobody knew what they were about to do with slavs or those who they deem were unworthy to live . 
  remove commonwealth from the premises !, 
  oh wait , it already is . 
  nope , they were n't . 
  especially not in 1940 's . 
  iirc there is a anecdote about lithuania , sweden and ussr . 
  sadly i do n't remember specifics about anecdote , but it goes like that : first secretary of lssr calls head of state of ussr and asks him if he could make lithuania independent while taking all the army out of territory for one day , hs says * nyet !, 
  * and drops the call . 
  day later same happens as usual hs says * nyet !, 
  * , after a week of this hs finally gives up and says * da * to fs . 
  after last soviet soldier gone out of lithuanian territory and lithuania was proclaimed independent , fs instantly declared war on sweden and surrenders , as sweden annexed lithuania ussr could n't re-occupy it since it would start ww3 . 
  of course it sounds way cooler if only i could find original . 
  poles and their commonwealth digging . 
  germans are always welcome here . 
  finland/sweden/austria / ireland are within their cold war relic neutrality , even though they already breached it by joining eu . 
  plus they are still closely working with nato countries , that makes them practically part of it . 
  iceland is in nato ... 
  i 'm specifically talking about eastern europe . 
  besides , since when do our soldiers fight for americans wars ? 
  were are like what , 20 lithuanians in iraq ? 
  wow . 
  fighting for american oil for sure ... lol . 
  too much propaganda for you , boy . 
  joining eu is pretty much making steps towards nato too . 
  we love you too .

  welcome my ruthenian friends < 3 hope you will have fun touring in lithuania !, 
  since the beginning the video shows to be a full of crap . 
  fall of ussr was greatest thing to eastern bloc and baltic states for sure . 
  ukraine or russia 's misfortune has nothing to do with capitalism , but corrupt ex-commies taking over all wealth , just like they did during commie times . 
  especially focusing on ukraine , the least successful story . 
  why not poland , czech republic or estonia ? 
  then they should jail those uncivilized muslims . 
  proud of you \u010cekija .

   lithuania 's massive collaboration and that massive collaboration was [ 200 people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ypatingasis_b\u016brys ) out of 3 million , yeah , i guess we 're natural born killers ... lol,

  france and germany going full balkan thread . 
  it 's totally biased towards countries that are in shit spot at this very moment , like ukraine or russia . 
  average american has no say in usa 's foreign policy , let alone who are their allies and who are not . 
  average american does not protect my borders , american soldiers do . 
  all he can do is brag . 
  part of a machine unstoppable as merciless as tidal waves !, 
  totally no biased . 
  lol, 
  i 'm not denying germanisation , i 'm denying over exaggeration on scale of it when it comes to baltics . 
  what ever fantasy you live , both soviets and nazis are scum of the earth , neither should be praised , but for some reason several nations still praise ussr . 
  savage . 
  those were plans , were there many others . 
   * alfred rosenberg , minister for the occupied territories in the east , was of the opinion that the balts would become loyal subjects of the german reich and should be allowed to retain their language and autonomy . 
  there was the expectation that `` germanization '' should proceed peacefully , i.e. 
  by enforcing the usage of german language for the higher administration levels and within the ss officer corps . 
  * and actually ussr 's policy was also sovietization aka russification . 
  ethnic latvians were already becoming minority in it their own country during last days of ussr . 
  i 'm not here to defend nazis , but for the baltics , nazis were the lesser evil in practical eyes . 
  you can laugh as much as you want , it 's reality for such small nations like mine who has almost a millennia old adversary next door . 
  oh , i 'm not here to justify usa 's foreign influence , they 're full of shit , but they 're the only nation we trust at this very moment as ironic as it sounds . 
  i really like charles de gaulle and wish more european leaders were like him . 
  i support strong and united europe . 
  why are you angry at americans ? 
  do you understand serbians and albanians within kosovo started to genocide each other , it was a spark that could have involve even more countries into the up coming huge fire . 
  nato bombing of both sides stopped them from committing more murders . 
  something close to that of n. ireland and ira . 
  kosovars ( muslims ) hated serbs , and serbs hated kosovars , so as always balkan way the only way - [ genocide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq_j2c6hrz0 ) each other . 
  that 's where remove kebab memes were born from . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia, 
  wait , does that mean we 're also sued ? 
  o.g member of nazi party , yes , but not the creator of it . 
   but at least the soviets did n't exterminate 85 % of all lithuanians like the nazis planned to what , when did nazis exterminate 85 % of lithuanians ? 
  you clearly meant that it was their plan , one of many , that did n't align with nazi leadership within ostland reichskommissariat .
