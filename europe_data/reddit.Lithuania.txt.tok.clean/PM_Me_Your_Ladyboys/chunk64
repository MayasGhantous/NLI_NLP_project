  * alfred rosenberg , minister for the occupied territories in the east , was of the opinion that the balts would become loyal subjects of the german reich and should be allowed to retain their language and autonomy . 
  there was the expectation that `` germanization '' should proceed peacefully , i.e. 
  by enforcing the usage of german language for the higher administration levels and within the ss officer corps . 
  * even during 1933 hitler in one of his many speeches referred to balts and specifically lithuanians as part of master race and for a good [ reason ] ( https://i.imgur.com/goo27w2.png ) . 
  * lithuanians , like most other baltic/scandinavian cultures , have been known for being people of above average height . 
  at the end of the 19th century , the average height of males was 163.5 cm ( 5 ft 4 in ) and the average height of females was 153.3 cm ( 5 ft 0 in ) . 
  by the end of the 20th century , heights averaged 181.3 cm ( 5 ft 11 in ) for males and 167.5 cm ( 5 ft 6 in ) for females . 
  * - balts were never considered untermensch , contrary , they were going towards `` aryan race '' . 
  - one of many reasons why nazi and lithuanian relationship was n't that soft was because first we were either jailing or exiling pro-nazis/fascist of lithuania , fascists failed their pro-fascist coup within lithuania and memelland border dispute , let 's not forget even then hitler sought alliance with lithuania and suggested invasion of poland and re-conquering vilnius region , instead we took many polish civilian and army refugees . 
  lithuanians saw wehrmacht army as liberators from soviet terror , but our population was still unwilling to join `` german cause '' , our waffen ss units would usually go rogue on german army . 
  most lithuanian collaborationists were released from prison or came back from exile like augustinas voldemaras , leader of failed pro-fascist coup within lithuania . 
  - there is no difference if you flip them around , both are the devils , except hitler actually as human that had some good qualities , unlike stalin born as bandit , died as tyrant , while hitler born as painter and soldier also died as tyrant . 
  * free will * is pretty much a myth . 
  it 's hard to guess alternate history , way too many variables and possibilities . 
  ** idiocracy **, 
  not , but commie ideology is no better than nazi one . 
  millions of people starved to death because of it . 
  that depends on perspective i guess . 
  latvia was already minority in their own country during last days of ussr . 
   which is why stalin started the bloodiest war in human history he invaded poland together with nazi germany ( let 's us count several other states like finland , lithuania , estonia , latvia , romania ) . 
   started a worldwide political ideology based upon racism and hatred as if soviet ideology was not ? 
  millions of people starved to death , millions of families from little babies to old people were exiled to coldest parts of siberia . 
  hundred of thousands died because soviet regime deemed them `` not trust worthy '' . 
   and also orchestrated the largest genocide in human history ... 
  it 's cool to kill people as long as it 's your people ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_famine_of_1932\u201333 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_chinese_famine etc. 
  i never said he 's innocent . 
  yeah , i just found out . 
  only in battles near black sea it was mainly used , which makes sense , it was pretty important region for nazis to hold e.g. 
  oil . 
  yeah , right , like every nazi had inherently completely mirrored views that of hitler ... you do know hitler is not the one that founded nazi party ? 
  he was pretty much just a orator . 
  i 'm 22 , but damn , this is a bit way too extreme . 
  it 's not young that drink bunch of alcohol but village folks that got nothing else to do after finishing their day work . 
  i mean * idiocracy * came to usa , why should n't * v for vandetta * come to uk ? 
  i mean hitler was animal right supporter , also he never used gas bombs , as ww1 veteran he knew how horrific experience it is . 
  and other trivia . 
  hitler was the devil , but stalin was the devil . 
  you got ta keep the dynasty alive . 
  just like lukashenko preparing his son to take over the throne of potatolandia . 
  lakes . 
  denying evolution pretty much says it . 
  just trivia . 
   i want independence and freedom . 
  how the hell you do n't have that ? 
  well he has a slavic wife . 
  makes me sad honestly , what is wrong with most of western countries , did they forgot what nations are made for to begin with . 
  the only thing i 'm comparing is central governments ignorance that people will forget their wishes if you ignore them long enough . 
  self determination is every nation 's right , denying it only shows central government 's true colours . 
  93 % of our yearly generated gdp was taken by soviet authority , so multi national `` collaboration '' ai n't that sweet for us in the memory . 
   or is the lithuanian pm somehow in favour ? 
  yes . 
  our pm from 2012-2016 supported self determination of catalonia . 
  same spot as cyprus , culturally european , geographically yes and no , depends how you see it . 
  it 's ok what ? 
  you 're accusing me of comparing ussr occupation to that of spanish civil war without any backing facts of me doing so . 
  why are you talking lies ? 
  you 're half right . 
  welcome to homophobes mind . 
  excuse me ? 
  as i said , we shall see . 
  we will see , you ca n't really predict things like these . 
  -  lithuania 's pm on catalonia : each country `` has the right to self determination '' . 
   prime minister of lithuania ( 2012-2016 ) , algirdas butkevicius , stated that each country `` has to find its own way '' and `` has the right to self-determination '' when he was specifically asked about catalonia 's human chain . 
  they look cute together . 
  i do n't really speak spanish or catalan , what i gather this is some kind of `` racist '' page or . . ? 
  actually we were a [ kingdom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_lithuania ) ( christanized due to realpolitik ) , but lost that status due to reverting back to paganism after to raids have n't stopped . 
  even then , most countries , including pope and [ holy roman emperor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_lutsk ) referred to our grand dukes as kings and grand dukes themselves saw themselves as * king * of lithuania . 
  you ai n't even that poor ... 
  your single person might get less money , but your infrastructure is far superior to ours , i would assume . 
  - catalonia : ** gdp ** ( nominal ; ** 2012 ** ) \u2022 ** total ** $ 255.204 billion \u2022 ** per capita ** $ 33,580 - ** gdp ** ( ppp ; 2012 ) \u2022 ** total ** $ 336.162 billion \u2022 ** per capita ** $ 43,837 - ----------------- - lithuania : ** gdp ** ( nominal ) ** 2017 ** estimate \u2022 ** total ** $ 42.826 billion \u2022 ** per capita ** $ 15,090 ( 49th ) - ** gdp ** ( ppp ) 2017 estimate \u2022 ** total ** $ 90.387 billion \u2022 ** per capita ** $ 31,849 ( 41st ), 
  [ not at all . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6g7741/catalonia_sets_independence_referendum_the_1st_of/dio6ui0/ ) i 'm comparing struggle , also ignoring people 's wish for self determination by central governments . 
   saying that catalonia has right to self-determination in international law is the equivalent of denying climate change in environment science . 
  those two are mutually exclusive . 
  you trolling or what ? 
  we do love you too . 
  i doubt he 's russian , given the fact that i have like 100 upvotes on him . 
   so it 's completely fair that you have absolutely zero idea of how things are in this side of europe . 
  i know exactly how this thing is . 
  we had our own [ `` spanish '' identity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) . 
  our own [ eternal union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_polish_coup_d%27\u00e9tat_attempt_in_lithuania ) . 
  times change so do borders of some nations , some new ones appear , some disappear . 
  it 's catalan people self determination to stay within spain or to become independent . 
  so rejecting this is kick in the balls to my own people who fought for self determination against russian/german empires , including ussr . 
  spain unlike , germany , italy or france , are made from different kingdoms , if you want to compare spain to somebody , compare it to poland and lithuania , who are identical other than language and ethnicity , the so called `` eternal union '' ended after ww1 . 
  so just because it 's non-autonomous region , it has no right for self determination , what kind of logic is that ? 
  latvia , lithuania and estonia were `` widely autonomous '' republics within ussr , did we also did n't have any right for self determination ? 
  for some reason people think nationalism - evil , while completely forgetting about self determination . 
  people forget about thing called self-determination , it 's quite sad to see this in comment section . 
   you know , estonians are also not a uniform nation . 
  as if [ lithuania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/etnoregionai.png ) is not ? 
   i support their identity and their language , however , i would consider thoughts of their own country stupid and populist . 
  that depends on perspective . 
  the guy is asking who cares , i answered who cares . 
  after all catalan people look at us as [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_way ) , even though they 're not as oppressed compared to us when we were under soviet occupation , they 're still a nation with different language , culture and identity , shoving `` spanish '' identity is not different from shoving `` soviet '' identity . 
  so people should be denied self-determination ? 
  quite ironic hearing this from estonian . 
  this building has very cool looking towers , nice . 
  [ the day of baltic unity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_saule ), 
  lithuania does care .
