  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5d1jqn/eli5why_do_such_places_as_catalonia_and_quebec/da13eir ) that does n't exclude them from self-determination . 
  catalan economy is repressed by subsidizing other regions . 
  besides , it 's peoples right to do what they wan with their future . 
  you know , self determination of nation . 
  best of luck my fellow europeans . 
  the holy ass . 
   embrace the germanicisms !, 
  [ remove teuton . 
  why am i heretic ? 
  in old lithuanian it used to be * un * . 
  but your language is least baltic of all baltic languages . 
  you should learn our grammar to get back to your baltic roots . 
  we 're bomb , you know !, 
  i know metalocalypse , but even i did n't catch that phrase ... 
  but now that you reminded me i did . 
  i tried once peanut butter , did n't like it at all for some reason . 
  tea . 
  good enough for me . 
  jesus , if only we had those ... depression would be gone in no time . 
  because people are religious assholes . 
  but everything changed , when commie nation attacked . 
  do n't be jelous eesti , at least we have * somebody that we used to know ... ~ ~ *, 
  mars . 
  got ta be connected with civilized countries for once . 
  latvia/estonia - protestant , lithuania is catholic . 
  given the fact that estonia and latvia were one state - livonia , ruled by baltic nobility ( baltic germans ) , while lithuania was independent most of it 's history and allied with catholic nations such as poland , including teutonic order , we used their stone builders to build our castles . 
  we just go to latvia to buy random beer and compare them to ours . 
  hmm , maybe one day when lithuania and polish economy recover , some intermarium might reborn again , you would be our little east germany . 
  better that than interwar government that thought soviets will keep their word and will let us stay neutral ... 
   there is no strategic value . 
  land connection for kaliningrad region , closer towards gotland which is vital part in controlling baltic sea , furthering nato border from russia etc. 
  best of luck , buddies . 
  ca n't they just become independent ? 
  do they really hold that much industry or something else ? 
  but estonia is biggest peasant country of all peasant countries , you never had your own nobility !, 
  while lithuania had highest concentration of nobility !, 
  well latvians are abomination of everything that surrounds them o.o, 
  shush little russian . 
  polish and lithuanian cities are identical and there is a [ reason ] ( https://i.imgur.com/gur9qb8.png ) for that . 
   who already have achieved a ** high degree of economic cooperation ** do you even know what it means ? 
  i would understand eurozone , but just northern countries ... lulz, 
   just ~ ~ imagine ~ ~ look at that massive ~ ~ baltic ~ ~ / u/secaer butthurt . 
  did n't answer my question . 
  do you even see the date between that and that ? 
  and what happened between those dates ? 
  til kazakhstan is in europe . 
   i love diversity !,

  nobody uses those terms at all ( including n. european plain ) , i 'm just used to say northern european plain . 
  there are few stories like most of the team leaving platform , before even taking their medals , since commentators said to congratulate new champions - the russians . 
  those guys who left were lithuanians . 
  well there is a reason why ussr started to gain bunch of gold medals from eurobasket . 
  as i said , sometimes . 
  [ yes they do . 
  not only that , different countries count alcohol consumption differently . 
  you could just wrote europe and central asian countries ? 
  why write soviet union , that shit of a country does n't exist any more . 
  sometimes north european plain is a heaven to live in . 
  sometimes . 
  that will take even more work . 
  * * lithuania : atr , want it or not ? 
  * * poland : hold my sobieski vodka *, 
  i know , but most maps show half of volhynia already eaten up too . 
  our grand dukes referred to themselves as kings and so did foreigners . 
  congress of lutsk primary goal was to make lithuania officially a kingdom again . 
  it should be duchy ( kunigaik\u0161tyst\u0117 ) since gdl was de facto kingdom e.g. 
  equal to that of king , both pope and other foreigners looked at it , but poles ( especially lithuanian ruler of poland ) did n't want to lose influence on gdl so they did what ever was in their hands to prevent de jure kingdom status . 
  and principality is mostly used for ex-kievan rus ' left overs . 
  principality implies it is ruled by prince , which is lower tier title compare to duke/grand duke/arch duke and lastly king . 
  i 'd say such small army inflicting huge number of losses to soviets , is pretty good ass kicking . 
   grand principality of lithuania  grand principality  principality ** triggered !, 
  you 're genius . 
  actually after i 'm done with conscription , i 'll just be a stripper . 
  got exam next week and here i 'm browsing reddit and memes at 5 am . 
  neither pork being wasted for nothing . 
  too much good of a food . 
  why are n't you sleeping ? 
  woo baby , watch out for russians . 
  but interwar lithuanian government refused hitler 's offer to invade vilnius region and instead took polish refugees , even though interwar polish government threatened to attack us if we do n't re-establish diplomatic relations . 
  ohhh . 
  well we showed middle finger to hitler during interwar period several times , even though we were super pro-german during that time . 
   but it was not merely treaties of friendship that the nazis had in mind for the baltic area . 
  at some time , presumably after 1933 , in the presence of hitler and other nazis , rausch-ning participated in a discussion of `` ostraumpolitik . '', 
  hitler , referring specifically to lithuania , stated that ' the lithuanians could be racially assimilated . 
   the significant aspect of hitler 's view is that he regarded the balts as being essentially close to the master race , which they might join after certain corrective measures had been taken by the germans . 
  hmm , never seen this kind of borders of g.d. of lithuania on a map . 
  damn , i wish i was there . 
  pan-european highway . 
  * sabaton - ghost division * , making their own highway . 
  are n't you ? 
  :( thought we might join you this time . 
  sad . 
  what do you mean ? 
  * they are the panzer elite , born to compete , never retreat * * ghost division , * * leaving our dead , always ahead , fed by your dread * - * always ahead , as the blitzkrieg rages on * * breaking morale the with the sound of blazing guns * * first in the line of fire , first into hostile land * * tanks leading the way , leading the way *, 
   stop clinging to cold war remnants just because the un has n't caught up baltics are part of n. europe , they did catch up . 
  yeah , those teeth .
