  9000 were deported to siberia ... 
  yeah , being [ hanged ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky#northwestern_krai_governor_general ) is better than being shot in a forest . 
  depends from which side you view , nazis killed less people than commies , while practically doing same shit , ethnic genocide , concentration camps , colonization , destroying national identity , shoving `` soviet '' identity down your throat . 
  if you do n't accept it you get killed . 
  * strong * * and * * stable *, 
  who in the hell would want to ally themselves with commie regime ? 
  it was no better than nazi one . 
   germans ( ironically ) , the french , italian , spanish none of them got occupied by red army , none of them saw horrors inflicted by red army . 
  only after fall of ussr the horrors were finally stopped to be hidden from the world . 
  * if there 's something strange in your ~ ~ neighbor ~ ~ nazihood * * who you gon na call ? 
  * [ * ~ ~ ghost ~ ~ jewbusters !, 
  did i said i wanted nazis to win ?!, 
  i despise both nazi and soviet regime , but regimes sought to kill people they deem to be enemy of the state . 
  soviet invaded us first , before nazis did , they started killing our people , before nazis did , you know that right ? 
  mickevi\u010dius was lithuanian and so was pilsudski . 
  stop stealing history . 
  a. mickevi\u010dius is definition of `` who the fuck he was '' . 
  but only one lithuanian was king of poland . 
  :( unless you count pilsudski , which had lithuanian blood line . 
  this is soviet system , not czarist . 
  even though [ czarist regime ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky#northwestern_krai_governor_general ) was no better . 
  sadly . 
  i prefer soviets to leave our land after so called `` liberation '' . 
  i do . 
  i 'm talking about grand dukes as rulers of gdl ( like vytautas or k\u0119stutis ) , not supreme dukes ( jogaila ) that [ civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_civil_war_ ( 1389 -- 92 \\ ) ) created . 
  after russia bombed them to the ground and suppressed any desire for independence . 
  yes , you 're right , either way , i just wanted ussr to fall as nazi germany did . 
  how exactly is nato `` evil '' and an `` empire '' ? 
   but the same could be said about the swedish kings , they never called themselves emperors , so i do n't know why people call it an empire in english . 
  funny , all lithuanian grand dukes called themselves * king * of lithuania . 
  after european union federalize we can start colonization process again in other parts of the world e.g. 
  european empire !, 
  you 're way too bad . 
  too bad that you 're pro-commie . 
  as long as you invest into lithuania i 'm happy . 
  are you ? 
  i mean , are n't you pro-commie which pretty much fallows suit with pro-russia views ? 
  actually they pay fee . 
  https://youtu.be/ruetmrjbkwi before ww1 we pretty much fought against russification . 
  other than lithuania minor , yes . 
  but most of ww1 , we were under germany . 
  central power , best power . 
  he 's your typical vatnik . 
  rather badly worded . 
  banning latin alphabet already means books in our language banned , nobody printed lithuanian books in cyrillic , [ nobody wanted to read books in cyrillic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) to begin with . 
  and your `` non-delusions '' involves baltics and finland being part of russia ? 
  lithuanian do not read in cyrillic alphabet , that was foreign to us . 
  that 's why we joined nato , so people like you with imperialistic ambitions who are still butthurt about losing `` what was once ours '' would eat their nails because they ca n't kill a foreign civilian . 
  they fought with their hearts against soviets , they did not give their jewish population to nazi germany , in the end finland had to fight remaining nazi germany forces in lapland . 
  you need to realize that nazi germany was not the only evil on european continent . 
   oberf\u00fchrer adolf ax , commander of the 15th division , reported on 27 january 1945 : '' ** they are first and foremost latvians . 
  they want a sustainable latvian nation state . 
  forced to choose between germany and russia , they have chosen germany , because they seek co-operation with western civilization . 
  the rule of the germans seems to them to be the lesser of two evils ** . '', 
  this perspective resulted in part from ** the soviet occupation between 1940 and 1941 ** , called '' ** the year of terror ** '' ( latvian : baigais gads ) during which ** tens of thousands of latvian families were executed or deported to siberia with men separated from the women and children to break down resistance ** . 
  -  in 1946 , the nuremberg tribunal declared the waffen-ss to be a criminal organization , making an exception of people who had been forcibly conscripted . 
  throughout the post-war years , ** the allies would apply this exception to the soldiers of the latvian legion and the estonian legion ** . 
  the us displaced persons commission in september 1950 declared that :  '' ** the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states ** . '', 
   because of wwi and the civil war , not voluntarily . 
  does n't change the fact that they did . 
  even then ussr illegally occupied us for 50 years . 
  umm , no , they ceded those territories . 
  and those are not historical russian territories to begin with , people who lived there did not wanted to be part of russia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_brest-litovsk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet\u2013lithuanian_peace_treaty, 
  i 'm not talking about post-independence from russian empire . 
  exactly , they do n't deserve to be called liberators . 
  quite ironic to think about it , nazis got idea of mass concentration camps from soviet gulags . 
  it 's just a geographical name , like georgia in usa and georgia as an actual sovereign state . 
  that 's only after ussr already taken half of europe , if only allies gave less resources for ussr , enough to hold off nazis , but not enough to push them back . 
  all of europe would by now celebrate of allied victory . 
  instead we got half of europe under second tier tyranny , getting their economies fucked by garbage ideology . 
  i wish ussr would have fallen the same day nazi germany did , western allies would have saved all of europe . 
  which is ironic , that soldier probably killed more civilians than soldiers . 
  when your grandmother gets raped and killed in most brutal fashion by `` liberating '' red army , for sure you will get salty . 
  and you 're biasing this on what source ? 
  thank you mr. armchair general . 
  i wish we were liberated by moose full of syrup , not by the devil . 
  most nations , like ours fully understand your side . 
  finland and nazi germany were not allies , they were co-belligerents , if you actually know what that means . 
  finland were n't allied with nazi germany when winter war ( soviet invasion of finland ) started , west took a blind eye to it , so finland had no other choice but seek help from ussr enemy - nazi germany . 
  enemy of my enemy is my friend . 
  russians at the end of the day were slavs , the only way to fight your place under the sun in nazi regime was being part of waffen ss , there full germans had to obey high ranked officer , even if the officers nationality was flemish . 
  why do fucking people say that we would end up under nazi rule instead of soviet rule , we would prefer to be part of neither and if possible see ussr fall , while nazi germany would fallow suit and fall too . 
  primo victoria, 
   it 's the soviets that get less thankfulness today due to the history of the cold war more like for 1940 's and 1944-1960 's when they butchered half of our nation , not even talking about other nations , like poles or germans who got ethnically cleansed from their homeland . 
  raping and pillaging their way on berlin . 
   soviet soldiers because soviets were as much brutal animals as nazis were . 
   ussr was a part of the allies . 
  and before that split half of europe together with nazis , invaded half of poland , invaded and occupied baltic states , got it 's ass kicked by finland in winter war and then ripped parts of romania . 
  what a wonderful fellow `` ally '' . 
  to hell with ussr . 
  [ baltics were most literate places in russian empire ... ] ( https://i.imgur.com/pu7wb4p.jpg ) given that after our indendence those number would boost up because there would no ban on national language and no foreign language being forced to use . 
  [ stop resisting our `` liberation '' . 
  boy just want to have fun . 
  heroes that saved half of europe from both nazism and communism . 
  it 's not an island though , it has sea access . 
  up for everything . 
  but unlike lithuania , the military conflict was fought on your soil . 
  we have n't seen blood since 90 's when soviets rolled over unarmed civilians . 
  i agree with you .
