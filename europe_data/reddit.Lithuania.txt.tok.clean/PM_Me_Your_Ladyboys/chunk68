  jesus christ , i just got a boner . 
  that does n't mean they have a right to keep occupying that land , it 's up to chechens what to do with chechnya , not up to russians . 
  is lithuania as state , hostile to russia ? 
  if so , how ? 
  [ for pro-commie mind like yours .

  [ well , you had chance ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_of_greater_austria ), 
  [ * all of those countries are indeed hostile towards russia to some degree * .

  it does matter when the numbers are speaking for themselves , i rather not see russian aligned estonia and latvia , like ukraine was and belarus still is . 
  awesome response . 
  i 'm hostile to russia because some `` estonian '' dude says so . 
  you know one thing ? 
  he can obtain citizenship . 
  all he has to do is learn latvian or estonian language on basic level , that 's about it . 
  twenty seven years have passed , more than enough time i 'd say to learn official language on basic level , would n't you agree ? 
  because we did n't have large minority that could influence our future politics . 
  german guy and austrian girl look so hot . 
   would take both . 
  france is austria in mid party . 
  of course not , that 's why russians that were brought to baltics are illegal migrants . 
  so presidents opinion is also my opinion , please ... 
  yeah ? 
  poland and lithuania were at war during interwar , did it stop us from joining nato and eu ? 
  poland was actually pushing for nato and eu , also promoting lithuanians accession to it , because both of our countries left the past behind . 
  woosh ... 
  nato is not some kind of cool kids club , it 's a body that ensure peace in the region , which serbs sure like to violate . 
  do you consider nazi and soviet split of second polish republic legal ? 
  that 's before existence of international law ( league of nations/united nations ) . 
  he 's tagged as [ pro-commie ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a3ot8/happy_victory_day_on_this_day_72_years_ago_soviet/dhbivlr/ ) , from the comment that is now deleted . 
   then perhaps actual locals should n't remain a part of nato yes , they 're free to flee back to russia . 
   hide behind its protection while denying human rights to a minority nobody denies their accession to citizenship , they themselves intentionally refuse to learn latvian and estonian language to obtain citizenship . 
   contributing little to the alliance nato is not a cool kids club . 
   to call someone illegal immigrant who lived there much of his life and moved there legally at the time , is strange . 
  nobody stops them from becoming legal citizens , you know ? 
  quit dodging the question . 
   unfriendly ; antagonistic . 
  how exactly are we unfriendly with russia ? 
  you still have n't provided facts for your `` hostile '' claim . 
  when why are you surprised when we show different opinion , that align with our government and country . 
  if they 're `` oppressed '' is n't it polish governments job to take them back to poland and give them `` all the rights they deserve '' ? 
  still at least 20x better than communism . 
  i 'm not done discussing the topic , you say that we 're `` hostile '' towards russia , how exactly are we hostile towards it ? 
   all of those countries are indeed hostile towards russia to some degree . 
  not always , only after russia occupied them . 
   especially polish ( but may i ask you to provide me some examples of me being ultra nationalist , as you asked me ? ) . 
  making polish language as regional language in latvia , even though they 're insanely small minority . 
   i care about huge population of stateless people in one of the eu states , that happens to be latvia and estonia . 
  you do realize they 're stateless because they ** choose ** to be like that . 
   saying that someone is doing in my opinion that 's opinion , you can express it , but do n't expect people to agree with you . 
   saying that someone is doing something wrong . 
  which is about these minorities that choose not to obtain citizenship , but rather live with alien passport . 
  so we 're unfriendly because exactly why ? 
  every single state in europe slaughtered each other , maybe it 's time to leave the past and think rationally ? 
  you know . 
  neutral argument ? 
  you 're clearly attacking latvian state , for not lowering their heads to illegal minorities , which can but choose not to obtain citizenship . 
  and since you 're well known polish ultra nationalist it is not surprise why i said , found your agenda , since it included polish minority in latvia , you did n't really care about russians . 
  welcome to the club , buddy !, 
  you 're exaggerating . 
  the only mad dog is you . 
  pretty sure those poles were n't lazy to obtain citizenship , given that ~ 90 % of them have mixed ethnicity . 
  one day , my friend , one day . 
   making sure that minorities do not integrate within latvian state . 
  you did n't provide any examples on how i have anti-polish sentiment . 
  religion is a joke . 
   crusading just is n't as fun without your friends , though . 
  such friend that started to raid and rip your lands apart . 
   similarly to how we 're going to get back wilno when russia is invading you . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giedroyc_doctrine ) besides , if we fall , you fall too , remember that . 
   because you are a rellay bad interlocutor , you do n't use any arguments , you are just throwing accusations clearly you 're talking about yourself . 
   also your anti-polish sentiment is unbearable examples ? 
  you 're actually the one that shows anti-latvian sentiment , making sure that minorities do not integrate within latvian state . 
   stateless person in any eu country , because this status automatically implied that you are stripped of basic human and political rights the only right they do n't have is that of voting . 
  they simply can fix it by acquiring citizenship , they 're are free to do it , but they do n't , you know why ? 
  because they refuse to learn official language on basic level . 
  these people are the ones that prevent themselves from acquiring citizenship , not state . 
  i 'm asking your own definition of being hostile , not it actually means . 
  since when protecting yourself from possible russian invasion is hostility ? 
  should n't it suppose to reverse , us preparing to invade russia to count as hostility . 
  hostile towards their ability to invade ? 
  because [ polish minority 's leader ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valdemar_toma\u0161evski ) is kremlin 's useful idiot . 
  what is your definition of being hostile ? 
  you really think lithuania wants russia to crumble ? 
  battle of saule is as much known battle as battle of grunwald . 
  i mean , you had to call for crusades because pagan prussians were kicking your ass . 
  nothing to back up ? 
  pretty weak , friend . 
  you clearly do n't know what fascism is . 
  those stateless people choose to be stateless . 
  nobody is preventing them from obtaining citizenship , with simple requirement - learning official language of country on basic level . 
  because they do n't want to learn it . 
  i fully understand that . 
  polish version of kremlin 's tactics , making sure minority is least integrated as possible . 
  even then , most poles in latvia are fully mixed with balts . 
   this silent , crawling ** fascism in baltic states ** baffles mmm ? 
  what is this then, 
  the only reason we have n't done what estonia and latvia done is because we did n't had huge russian minority , if kaliningrad oblast was connected to lssr , we for sure would have done same what estonia and latvia did , it would have slowed down our process to european union and nato , which post-commie polish government sought to speed it up as fast as possible . 
  pretty much a miracle that we ended up with low russian minority . 
  * unlimited `` wrinkles '' power .
