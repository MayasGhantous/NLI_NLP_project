  and we found your agenda , you succumb so fast . 
  besides , they can easily learn latvian language at basic level and have full latvian citizenship , do n't they ? 
  that 's their own stupidity that stops them from that . 
  so calling us fascist , is not trolling ? 
  but your genuine opinion , damn . 
  you make me laugh . 
  because it is . 
  should been dot , not comma . 
  fixed . 
  why should i delete my acc ? 
  what makes you so butthurt , about me ? 
  in latvia/estonia , lithuania gave everyone citizenship when independence was re-established , one of the reason - we did n't had huge russian minority , so we dodged the bullet . 
  he 's one of those `` shitty at trolling '' poles . 
   i get it that you were annexed by ussr , and there was not a legal estonian governement  but when they moved to estonia they did not crossed any border , they moved within the borders of one country , is it that hard to understand ? 
  stop contradicting yourself . 
  they 're illegal migrants , colonizers brought by occupational force . 
  oh look , bigger fascist dictatorship is talking . 
   but seriously , you must at least recognise russian as a local language that would stop integration . 
  nobody stops them to learn basic latvian/estonian , nobody forces them to use it on daily basis . 
   it is not , just there is a different structure . 
  i mean , one is finno-uralic , other is baltic language which is part of indo-european tree , so russians for sure will find baltic language as easier to learn . 
  you do realize ethnic russians in estonia and latvia have a full right to acquire citizenship , but intentionally do n't do it ? 
   we are talking about stateless person in today 's baltic countries estonia/latvia . 
  lithuania does not have stateless people . 
  not like it 's a bad thing . 
  that face is more than enough to kill my boner . 
   cultural , social and economic autonomy such autonomy that latvians by 89 's were less than half of total population , while ethnic russians tripled . 
  besides , it has nothing to do with ussr being generous , rather killing every commie sympathizer , these are [ heroes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers ) that manage to save our countries . 
  what are you smoking dude ? 
   the baltic states , the united states and its courts of law , the european parliament , the european court of human rights and the united nations human rights council have all stated that these three countries were invaded , occupied and illegally incorporated into the soviet union under provisions of the 1939 molotov -- ribbentrop pact , first by the soviet union , then by nazi germany from 1941 to 1944 , and again by the soviet union from 1944 to 1991 . 
  this policy of non-recognition has given rise to the principle of legal continuity , which holds that de jure , or as a matter of law , the baltic states had remained independent states under illegal occupation throughout the period from 1940 to 1991 . 
  do n't be ridiculous we hate communism more than nazism . 
  lithuanians voted for greens same way america voted for trump , they wanted `` change '' . 
  do n't be jelly unviking viking .

  christianity sucks , paganism master race . 
  you should worry about eastern russia rather than nato ... 
  * why is russia still not a colony * / s, 
   republic of estonia that was autonomous part of soviet union . 
  they were occupied and annexed , government of republic of estonia did n't join ussr , soviet installed puppets after cleansing legitimate government did , which makes it [ illegal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states#list_of_recognition_and_non-recognition_of_annexation ) , therefore essr is not legitimate governmental body . 
  and your point being ? 
  i 'm natural born killer ? 
  i 'm talking about nationalism . 
  just be happy that americans saved your ass from both nazis and soviets . 
  you mean pro fascists that were released from prison in return for collaboration and exiled [ radical nationalists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augustinas_voldemaras ) who tried a pro-fascist coup that failed are the reason why i should feel guilty or what ? 
  you do know [ jews ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nachman_dushanski ) were very supportive of soviet occupation and were collaborating with soviets authorities to put down resistance and after commie bloc finally fell , these war criminals fled to isreal . 
  people looked at germans as saviours from bolshevism , at that time nobody knew about horrors of nazi regime .

  well that shows exactly why i 'm right and why we both fell .

   not to mention that 15th largest economy means that it would still have a gdp lower than spain with population that 's almost 2x its size . 
  because ukraine and belarus are not particularity rich countries .
