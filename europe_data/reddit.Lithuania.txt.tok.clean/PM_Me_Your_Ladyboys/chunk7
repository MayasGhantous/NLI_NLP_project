  he was interested in dividing lithuania and poland , with a separate kingdom of lithuania , to reduce the influence of poland . 
  -  and yeah lithuania was a jagie\u0142\u0142o 's patrimony no it was n't . 
  his father was n't the only one who ruled gdl . 
  let alone he was n't the only one who ruled gdl . 
  island castle is ours ? 
  9 o.o 9, 
   can you give some examples ? 
  there was never real difference between nobles of both nations , also some noble lithuanian houses radzwi\u0142\u0142owie , pacowie , sapiehowie , czartoryscy were among the most influential houses . 
  in return they had to adopt polish language and polish customs as you can already see that in their names . 
  there is a reason they did that , devils offer . 
   also it is not poland fault that witold was n't crowned oh rly ? 
    in january 1429 , at the congress of lutsk vytautas received the title of king of lithuania with the backing of sigismund , holy roman emperor , but ** the envoys who were transporting the crown were stopped by polish magnates in autumn of 1430 ** . 
  ** another crown was sent , but vytautas died in the trakai island castle several days before it reached lithuania . 
  ** -  but jagie\u0142\u0142o 's who was at that time `` supremus dux lithuaniae '' and did not want to lost control of his patrimony there was no patrinomy , only civil wars and compromise . 
   in spring 1392 , jogaila proposed a compromise through his envoy , henry of masovia , bishop of p\u0142ock : vytautas would become the grand duke of lithuania if he would recognize jogaila as the supreme duke . 
   vytautas ruled lithuania until his death in 1430 ; his relationship with jogaila during these years is sometimes likened to the peaceful power-sharing demonstrated by their fathers algirdas and k\u0119stutis . 
  you did n't get the joke ? 
  that day costed us many lives and was one of the main reasons on losing lithuanian speaking population on eastern lithuania that would be filled with polish and ruthenian speaking people . 
   marked by betrayel i always laugh at these words when it come from pole , poland is the reason we did n't became kingdom again with crown arrival stalling , effectively making our nobility to have lower status . 
  we wanted to break union with poland long before union of lublin . 
  it was not a betrayal , rather a chance to finally escape polish dominance . 
  [ yes . 
  where it says portugal was part of spain . 
  it shows iberian union . 
  not sure , it just popped on my head . 
  it might be same deal as plc , western powers referred to commonwealth as kingdom of poland for some reason . 
  byzantium is used to distinguishing roman empire and eastern roman empire , because both of them called themselves romans . 
  yes baltics is a geographical term . 
  but ...  after the first world war the term `` baltic states '' was used to refer to countries by the baltic sea that had gained independence from russia in its aftermath . 
  as such it included not only former ** baltic governorates ( livonia ) , but also latgale , lithuania and finland ** . 
  before that nobody used baltic states because [ lithuania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/great_northern_war_part2.png/800px-great_northern_war_part2.png ) was part of the great power ( polish-lithuanian commonwealth ) in the region , while latvia and estonia were part of livonia . 
  obviously , religion was just justification . 
  there were far smaller empire in europe than swedish one . 
  empire has nothing to do with size . 
  they never called themselves empire . 
  i assume they lost it in some time of period . 
  please do n't use the term baltics when referring to that period , lithuania was one of the great powers , while estonia and latvia was known back then as livonia . 
  baltic term did n't exist until late xviii c.

   [ second bulgarian empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_bulgarian_empire )  an alternative name used in connection with the pre-mid 13th century period is the empire of vlachs and bulgars ; variant names include the vlach -- bulgarian empire , the bulgarian -- wallachian empire , or the romanian -- bulgarian empire ; the latter name was used exclusively in romanian historiography .

  union of k\u0117dainiai , best day of my life . 
  well the deluge was one of the reasons why eastern lithuania became populated by poles and ruthenians .

  in lithuania your would be known as bicycle republic .

  why else would czechoslovakia split ? 
   in 1992 , because of growing nationalist tensions in the government , czechoslovakia was peacefully dissolved by parliament . 
  on 1 january 1993 it formally separated into two independent countries , the czech republic and slovak republic .

  fun fact , our name for `` king '' is `` karalius '' which comes from `` carolingians '' . 
  conscription does n't mean that you will be send into foreign wars , you 're just put in reserve in case enemy attacks your home country . 
  in lithuania you spent 9 months in the army , learning how to defend your home front . 
  tell that to african or middle eastern countries how being non-homogeneous is a good thing ... you 're very naive on this matter . 
   is there actually any example where splitting a country in two actually improved the situation ? 
  lithuania and poland , soviet union , czechoslovakia , yugoslavia , sweden and norway , uk and ireland etc. 
  yes , latvian has a lot of german influence in it 's language . 
  lithuanian did n't change much because it was mainly spoken by rural people of lithuanian proper , since polish language over took lithuanian nobility after union of lublin . 
  first thing you should learn is that estonians ( finnics ) and latvians/lithuanians ( balts ) do not belong in same language group . 
  second you could learn lithuanian as it is one of the ie languages the changed least and is closest baltic language to old prussian . 
   to be noted that the christian anatolians did n't even identify as greek , but as ` romioi ' , which pretty much means romans , probably something that was left in their identity from the roman rule . 
  rather byzantine rule , as byzantine still identified as romans , the byzantine empire itself is just a made up name by historian scientists to distinguish roman empire and eastern roman empire . 
  it 's clearly made as a joke . 
  there are many other songs made by them as parodies . 
  still just a biased guess , nothing more , do n't try to prove something without having any facts . 
  this is after they cleansed armenians and greeks . 
  but then again :  although numerous modern genetic studies have indicated that the present-day turkish population is primarily descended from historical anatolian groups, 
  yes you 're right , but western most turkey used to be inhabited by greeks . 
  turkey itself , just like usa is melting pot , it is filled with different nationalities that happen to adopt turkish customs ( from hellenic , anatolians to the west , to arab , armenians , kurds in the east ) , turkish nationalism is just remnant of ottoman empire .

  i 'll have to disagree , what you 're trying to say to me is just guess , not scientifically proven fact . 
  by the time of plague all the great migrations were already over . 
  and all the war/crimes/rapes etc is just biased on guess . 
  yes , we 're 2.8 m people , but we 're not the only ones with similar general genetic make up . 
  lithuanians , like most other baltic/scandinavian cultures , have been known for being people of above average height . 
  and high concentration of [ blond hair and light eyes ] ( https://i.imgur.com/goo27w2.png ) . 
  for population of 2.8 m those 5 % are nothing , considering they 're far more integrated into lithuanian society than polish minority . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  we do n't have sizeable russian minority , they make out only 4.8 % of our population , which is lower than polish one . 
  not really . 
   since the neolithic period the native inhabitants of the lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside , so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements , although without being actually isolated from them . 
  the lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous , without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups . 
  man , if he said things like these to me , i would already shot my come back . 
  do n't worry , we 're not angry at you , trump is known for pro-putinism and anti-europeanism . 
  well you border a lot of nato members , besides , would you really think the polse would attack to take back skane ? 
  from my perspective , i 'd say kinda , what you did is to hold your superpower 's hegemony , what russia does is to hold it 's regional power 's hegemony . 
  but then again , usa is not threat to europe and is our ally , so we will probably brush off things you do since we got far bigger concerns to deal with , like bordering russia 's enclave - kaliningrad that is the most militarised piece of land in europe . 
  yeah , that 's why belgium , switzerland and luxembourg is shacking , germany , italy and spain asking for more nato troops on their soil to deter french aggression ... oh wait , such thing is non existent because france , unlike russia , is civilized xxi c. country . 
  first map shows catholics in black , how to know that ? 
  look at east prussia , see that weird shaped territory within east prussia , that 's royal prussia , catholic part of prussia that was part of polish-lithuanian commonwealth when duchy of prussia was created from teutonic order . 
  you 're telling me you did not ?
