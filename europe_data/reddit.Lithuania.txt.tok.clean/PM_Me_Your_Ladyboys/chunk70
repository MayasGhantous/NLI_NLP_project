  -  / edit : lithuanians obviously butthurt as fuck about 2nd vid ; yeah ... butthurt because of bad/false history ? 
  hmm , we need to help to pump those numbers up . 
  last old prussian disappeared only in xviii c. only nobility in prussia and livonia/courland was german . 
   while at the beginning the nobility was almost all lithuanian , with territorial expansion more ruthenian families joined lithuanian nobility . 
  as early as the 16th century , several ruthenian noble families began to call themselves ** gente ruthenus , natione lithuanus ** . 
  a good example is the chodkiewicz family , which attributed its ancestry to the house of gediminas . 
  this would also apply to lithuanians and prussians , born as one , identifying as another , since back then being polish was totally different from being polish now . 
  plc was in personal union with saxony , are they also now part of plc ? 
  it was personal union , that was broke off several times and renewed several times . 
  that was before union of lublin ( proclamation of plc ) , we were in personal union with poland , but we were n't one country when we had access to the black sea . 
  no need to show off how `` smart '' you are . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania#etymology is it so hard ? 
  sakartvelo big !, 
  no it does not . 
  go check the word 's meaning yourself . 
  rumunija/rumunas = / = rom\u0117n\u0173 imperija/rom \u0117n\u0173 \u017eem\u0117 , not even close . 
  what right are talking about ? 
  yes , it was reused , but majority of german prussians had old prussian ancestry . 
  well , it 's [ complicated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) , mostly poles love to take polonized lithuanians/ruthenians for themselves . 
  at least we , lithuanians acknowledge your great contribution to gdl . 
  imagine belarusians rose a mindaugas statue and started to implicate that he was ruthenian/belaruasian , not lithuanian . 
  rest is kebab blood . 
   i mean , romania literally means `` land of the romans '' nope . 
  romania derives from the latin romanus , meaning `` citizen of rome '' . 
  romans were colonists of dacia ( modern day romania ) . 
  if we 're taking examples , do people of kaliningrad can call themselves prussians ? 
  because fyrom is in roman ** expanded province ** of macedonia . 
  similar to [ old prussia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg/800px-baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg.png ) , who later got [ conquered ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/teutonic_order_1260.png/1024px-teutonic_order_1260.png ) by teutonic order ( e.g. 
  germanic order ) during [ northern crusades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades ) and by xviii c. was completely assimilated into german culture . 
  while after teutonic order 's large defeats to poland-lithuania was transformed into [ duchy of prussia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/rzeczpospolita_royal_ducal.png ) [ ( later kingdom ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/map-dr-prussia.svg/1024px-map-dr-prussia.svg.png ) and it grew out of control . 
  around 60 % of prussians from [ eastern prussia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/german_empire_-_prussia_-_east_prussia_%281878%29.svg/976px-german_empire_-_prussia_-_east_prussia_%281878%29.svg.png ) could trace their ancestry back to pagan times of old baltic prussians , that 's why name is not disputed unlike fyrom . 
   hatred for minorities umm , no . 
  against separatists , yes , against minorities , no . 
  why does n't latvia , poland , belarus or sweden bitch about nato troops ? 
  you wish that american troops would n't be in baltic states , would n't you . 
  sorry , took that `` d '' for myself . 
  both usa and lithuania are nato countries , attack on us is attack on them . 
   besides , if you do n't have any culture or history to be proud of , where else are you supposed to get your national identity from but victimhood ? 
  clearly talking about russia , right ? 
  a nation that built it 's national identity from ex-soviet one . 
  falling russia would actually be a huge problem , different factions gaining nukes , instead of one ... 
  there is no way turkey would ever be kicked , even then and it 's not like first time nato has dictatorship within it 's member states . 
  has nukes in kaliningrad , bitches about some hundred of troops in usa 's ally countries and fellow nato members . 
  : thinking :, 
  those [ anti-eu ] ( https://imgur.com/00xxucf ) guys . 
  * my favourite part of this entire brexit situation is when a guy tried to protest against the eu by burning the eu flag . 
  the flag did n't light due to eu regulations on flammable materials . 
  make yurop ' great again !, 
  there is difference between russian empire and ussr . 
  we sound spanish , we sound russian , we sound polish , we sound greek , ne , ne , ne , ne , ne , we sound [ lietuvi\u0161kai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gudccey09tm ) , r\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116\u0116 !, 
   that 's why it has stayed an economic union , if anything , so far . 
  if you think eu is not political union too , i have a bad news for you ...  also all referendums held for a more unified eu , like the so called `` eu constitution '' , were negative according to popular vote . 
  could i get source on that ? 
  besides from what i gather that depends from country to country . 
  also this is why i support multi-speed europe . 
  if some countries do n't want to join federal eu , it 's their choice , not mine . 
   you may be fond of the idea but if we also take into account the rise of euroscepticism and an eu member leaving already , a federal eu is light years away . 
  uk was the one that held eu army back , you know , for several decades . 
  euroscepticism is biased on migrant quotas that are enforced to other nations , even then being eurosceptic in some countries would be a political suicide . 
   a federal eu is light years away . 
  til we count time as metres . 
  [ ~ ~ len ~ ~ tre\u010diasis reichas ] ( https://youtu.be/x-lu7a4jfmg?list=wl ), 
  eu is ever closer union , with end goal - unification . 
  welcome to the internet . 
  those are for iranians and indians . 
  gypsies are not indians but they come from modern day india . 
  y u so kebab ? 
  [ soviet . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prpnw1ec0kw ) edit : added some `` glorious '' music . 
  i mean , i 'm not disputing the fact that soviet identity was literally built on russification , but claiming that ussr was russian empire , is just what russians want it to be . 
  that 's why every leader of ussr was russian . 
  how are you !, 
  oh yes , forth reich , best reich ... 
  russia was part of ussr . 
  i love the hilarious thing that medvedev said long time ago , '' * we will lower gas prices to lowest possible price if you leave nato * '' , i was like : xd, 
  it was created against ussr . 
  russia itself antagonized nato for past decades . 
  and united army , ooh yeah . 
  what a clown . 
  same . 
  as much as i want to move out , home will never feel like home elsewhere . 
  [ technicality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_wolf_ ( character \\ ) ) . 
  but our beaches are cool , germans come here to taste that memelland . 
  i 'll show my natural side . 
  try to westernize more , maybe we will accept you as european federation 's colony . 
  gypsies are not slavs ... they 're well , gypsies . 
  hope you 're safe now . 
  shut up , lenkai . 
  learn to spell lietuva , not litwa , too . 
  i wish they did n't . 
  yep . 
  that 's why i support federal europe . 
  i got a friend who lives in moscow , he occasionally watch tv news and yeah ... they do care . 
  that 's their media does n't say anything about us ... oh wait they demonize us a lot . 
  we do n't not believe on russian conquest of baltic states , we worry in meddling in our internal affairs . 
  we do n't need to wait 20-30 years , we need to elect people that are take initiative on fixing economy . 
  not just pushing time with yada yada alcohol ban , yada yada conscription . 
  estonia is a better success story , they have younger politicians while we elect same old commie born farts , what makes you think we will see a real change ? 
  no surprise . 
  there is reason for it .
