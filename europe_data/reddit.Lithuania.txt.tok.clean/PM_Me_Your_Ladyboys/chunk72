  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc-dgro1srq ) should be our marching hymn towards beijing . 
   you 're a fascist because you believe it 's more important to enforce your ideals on people than it is to promote the foundation of a modern democracy . 
  did i say , * implement order european federation , today disregard the riots or opinions of people * , no . 
  i 'm not against democracy and i 'm more supporter of multi-speed europe , since countries like uk hold integration back . 
  if you do n't want to be part of ef , then you 're free to live as irrelevant country , it 's your choice , not mine . 
  just because you look at ef as something `` evil '' , does n't mean everyone looks at it that way . 
   the eu and the in were founded on he right to self determination , the fact that you 're too ignorant to know this simple fact goes to show you ca n't see the bigger picture because you do n't even know what it is . 
  i know exactly what eu interests are , since it clashed with uk 's interests , they 're free to leave the eu . 
  eu is probably the best thing that happened on this continent and you want it to be disbanded ... you 're crazy , that 's all i got to say . 
   you threaten my fundamental rights as a human and my people , it 's my democratic duty to fight you , at least according to the philosophers who promoted democracy . 
  i threaten your own ultra-nationalist side , that does n't understand that extra layer of supranational state , will not destroy cultures , languages or people of those states that are within ef . 
  what you see is your own delusion of `` threats '' . 
   you 're a fascist and you do n't even know why , pathetic [ my nick name ... fascist ... ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/021/464/14608107_1180665285312703_1558693314_n.jpg ), 
  ~ ~ total world domination !, 
  mwuhahahaha ... ~ ~ promoting democracy and economic development independent of other states !, 
  so is usa . 
  i 'm talking about possible adversary , given that their and our interests would collide . 
   then you 're a fascist who does n't believe in democracy , congratulations fascist ? 
  just by that . 
  dude , you really got some mental problems . 
  just because you add one supranational layer on nation states , does n't mean they cease to exist . 
  is n't eu promoting democracy and threatening to take actions if poland and hungary do n't improve it ? 
   try to enforce that shit near me and i 'll punch your face in though , disregard my human rights i 'll disregard yours i 'm not disregarding your human rights . 
  not only you started to swear but also started to threaten me , really shows your educational level . 
  unlike you i see bigger picture and i 'm not closed within my comfort box . 
   i have quotes going back 10 years from every single person in a leadership position saying that the european project is more important than the will of a people in one sovereign nation . 
  which it is , i agree with them . 
  i 'm not asking for sources to begin with . 
  none , because unlike you , i 'm not delusional . 
   we 're snail pacing towards the end of nation states in europe , as directly stated by the eu leadership countless of times over the last decade and as their actions shows . 
  what pot are you smoking ? 
  * laughs *, 
  maybe china , given their population and growing to economic super giant . 
  how so ? 
  denmark , norway and iceland are in nato ... more than half of nordic countries . 
   we do n't want that . 
  you do n't want that , i want that . 
  where exactly , point them out . 
  this guy is literally talking non sense , i would n't take a word from him seriously . 
  make [ intermarium ] ( https://youtu.be/tqcbp4-c5su ) a thing again ? 
  like where ? 
  i know what you 're thinking , my dear . 
  i wonder what they feed you . 
  and all of belarus . 
  exactly and should stay this way . 
  just roll with it . 
  usa , land of broken promises . 
  starting to demonize it , like new forth reich , small eu nations being puppets while strong eu nations puppeteers . 
   `` germany . 
  bad . 
  stop . '', 
   `` murica . 
  good . 
  eagles . 
  stuff . '', 
  even cavemen speak better . 
  imagine if trump was a president back then ... 
  his whole buddy is like punching bag . 
  well , we do n't have good swear words , so you 're right , got ta import that russian , english , polish swear words . 
  [ feelsbadman . 
  time for operation ~ ~ barbarossa ~ ~ greater luxembourg . 
  no shit ? 
  guess it 's just specific mentality and already long ago established connections . 
  finland was baltic country as well before ussr occupation . 
  thank god for poland , providing us with good swear words . 
  i doubt that will ever happen , neither us nor belarusians wanted to unite after ww1 and were heading towards something [ else ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ) , which soviet occupation stopped . 
  [ polish-lithuanian identity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) intensifies . 
  in lithuania , teen and young adults like me use english words and terms etc. 
  practically together with lithuanian language , i do n't know , i guess it 's just same influence as russian had on older people during ussr times . 
  those are estonian russians that go to russia . 
   english really seems to influence us more than other , for some reason . 
  i have no strong idea why . 
  here is your [ answer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8ljrgcjnm ) . 
   we have nothing in common with people who would ally with america , the eternal enemy of rus . 
  til usa was a thing back in medieval ages . 
  you mean , it 's lithuanian puppet state , under disguise of being russian ally . 
  technically speaking , yes , being part of g.d. of lithuania was far better than being part of g.p. 
  of muscovy . 
   conquer local tribes and lay them under the tribute . 
  they literally assimilated to local culture , just like normans ( vikings ) assimilated to french culture . 
  i guess belarus is not independent rus ' state . 
  because it 's easier to integrate when english is already your second spoken language . 
  [ watch them jump !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/d91bvlavt24?list=plqtib-t4hoojpfglon3rkj5z8w1w376xe&amp;t=34 ), 
  tell that to linguists , lithuanian master language . 
  to lithuanians . 
  what , lol . 
  look at ukrainian north eastern border , wth . 
  poland earn less than lithuanians , what are you talking about ? 
  you probably meant nations that aligned with west are much better off . 
  it was a rhetorical question , but people took it seriously . 
  just like k\u00f6nigsberg , it lost it 's charm . 
  byzantine empire is eastern roman empire , you know that ? 
  shh baby , i love you who you are . 
  there is still / r/yurop for us . 
  and good at what they did best ... 
  really ? 
  quite a mind he has ... 
  sieg pencil !,
