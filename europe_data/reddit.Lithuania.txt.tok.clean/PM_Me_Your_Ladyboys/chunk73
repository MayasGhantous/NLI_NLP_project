  sieg pencil !, 
  true aryan , hitler would be proud . 
  if talking about old movies and awesome soundtracks . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akxi7f7afmu ) got ta be mine . 
  they would surely miss ussr , since they were benefiting under ussr and actually were the ones that wanted to preserve it , but russia did n't want that without ukraine as it would make - stan way too influential within ussr . 
  in east partnership is vied as a game in which your partner is put on his knees . 
  we drink beer everyday . 
  love that golden/marble look , shows that we 're catholic a lot . 
  [ my man . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jjphmt7j8g ), 
  that song ai n't that even good . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9x5adywxeo ), 
  you miss spelled * european reich, 
  it 's actually russia who is europhobic . 
  oh yeah , when you hear those nato jets passing by , you sure feel like war is coming . 
  triggering europe . 
  what was once europe is not any more . 
  there is only me here . 
  but they 're everywhere , you just do n't see them , we 're ninjas . 
  here ? 
   by the way are there any other lithuanians beside you in this sub ? 
  bunch of them ? 
  [ that 's not my blood . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_kazimierz_sapieha_the_younger ), 
  will never forget that blood soaked armour you wore . 
  is that how we met ? 
  it 's not just coastline , but rivers and lakes . 
  then again , i remember that russians dump all their waste near your waters . 
  [ too bad holy league did n't go further . 
  dark chapter in european history . 
  we surpassed estonia , horray !, 
  not only unnecessary but mostly aimed towards russia . 
  not against it . 
  start eurocoin collection . 
  23 % , what are those people ? 
   all their old allies hate them we were n't their allies to begin with , puppet governments , that '' s all they had . 
  none . 
  germanics used to inhabit all of poland , slavs used to inhabit all of east germany . 
  genetics = / = language . 
  so as you can see , yes . 
  edit : to note , you 're not slavic , you just share most genes with them . 
  petty much . 
  most of north western russia was inhabited by finno ugrics . 
  it 's threat to their expansion . 
  invest into eastern poland and make it so rich that kaliningrad people will want to be annexed by poland . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) gymnasium master high school . 
  well , yeah . 
  rule britannia , rule the ... air ? 
  that , let 's say , lithuanians , are poorer than russians and are cleaning toilets in uk . 
  you know , typical russian chauvinism . 
  plus they got different mentality what allies mean , [ vytautas landsbergis nails it ] ( https://youtu.be/yqfbkjnryn0?t=968 ) . 
  iirc , he 's russian . 
  you would be surprised . 
  in no world would nato ever invade russia , unless russia invades a nato member . 
  i 'd rather prefer to have american , german , dutch , british soldiers training together with our forces to defend and repel attack long enough for nato reinforcement . 
  that 's the best deterrent we can have . 
  half of countries that are shown are not even in nato . 
  ca n't get more delusional than that lol . 
  bases in east asia are against north korea and china , not russia . 
  in middle east , again , it 's not aimed against russia . 
  not only slavic , also baltic , germanic , finnic and romance ( romanian ) . 
  during lithuanian-soviet war when rsfr tried to create lithuanian-belorusian soviet republic since they were losing it and could n't create separate ssr . 
  nobody supported it , not even commies of lithuania or belarus . 
  i mean there were many questions about united poland-lithuania , lithuanian-latvian federation etc. 
   dude crack open a history book . 
  it wo n't do you harm . 
  i know about iberian peninsulas history . 
  if it was n't for franks , muslims would have gotten more of europe than just almost all of iberian peninsula . 
  i know that , but system between peasant and bajoras was still a feudal one . 
  what 's so ironic ? 
  it took three imperial states ( all at their golden age ) , to dismantle plc in three sequences . 
  yeah , but radvili\u0161kis was devastated many times by military forces , plague and hunger in the 17th -- 19th centuries . 
  there were no citizens left in radvili\u0161kis after the plague in 1708 -- 1710 . 
  usa did n't had such things . 
  [ memelland was never part of gdl , it was though inhabited by lithuanians . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png/800px-lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png ), 
  shhhh . 
  you eat that lovely pork !, 
  because it holds no epic vibe , like * the lion from the north * or * ghost division * , i guess it 's just too slow for my taste . 
  so germany is france now ? 
   together we are strong , divided we will fall . 
  plc saved ya ' ass and yet you partitioned us , not cool south eastern germany , not cool . 
  muslim invasion ? 
  pilsudski wetting himself right now . 
  as much as i like sabaton , that song sucks balls . 
  germany : woops , we tried to clean it up . 
   where are the national records for such mass migrations ? 
  we know of the baltic germans who formed the nobility of the baltic states for centuries , yet this is omitted ? 
  baltic germans ruled over modern latvia and estonia , not lithuania . 
  why not poland-lithuania ? 
  did i won a golden ticket to diabetesland ? 
  i 'm not talking about nation , but a state . 
  since 1948 . 
  so yeah . 
  couple . 
  we would live under ice by now !, 
  damn , my town is barely 500 years old . 
  happy birthday kiev !, 
  you probably do n't know that france won more wars than lost . 
  brits just do n't know how to show love for you , they 're jealous that germany is more attractive than uk .
