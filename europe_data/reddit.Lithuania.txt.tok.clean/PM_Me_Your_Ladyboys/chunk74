  this looks like more like a coat of arms . 
  i think does . 
  after all most of europe was united under romans . 
  well you 're pretty close to denmark ... mwuhahahahaaaahhahaa !, 
  not being able to scroll down on southern europe gave me a nerve . 
  i mean they ripped off [ battle of kircholm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kirchholm ) for their [ lord of the rings ] ( https://youtu.be/rcz3sn65kis?t=137 ) scene . 
  - * death * - * mu\u0161ki * huge ass cavalry riding from the hill . 
  insanely out numbered . 
  steam rolling the orcs/b \u00f6rks . 
  [ i mean , you have same crazy ass people in poland . 
  * the first humans arrived on the territory of modern lithuania in the 10th millennium bc after the glaciers receded at the end of the last glacial period . 
  according to the historian marija gimbutas , these people came from two directions : the jutland peninsula and from present-day poland . 
  they brought two different cultures , as evidenced by the tools they used . 
  they were traveling hunters and did not form stable settlements . 
  in the 8th millennium bc , the climate became much warmer , and forests developed . 
  the inhabitants of what is now lithuania then traveled less and engaged in local hunting , gathering and fresh-water fishing . 
  during the 6th -- 5th millennium bc , various animals were domesticated and dwellings became more sophisticated in order to shelter larger families . 
  agriculture did not emerge until the 3rd millennium bc due to a harsh climate and terrain and a lack of suitable tools to cultivate the land . 
  crafts and trade also started to form at this time . 
  speakers of north-western indo-european might have arrived with the [ corded ware ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corded_ware_culture ) culture around 3200/3100 bc . 
  [ we gave finland ptsd . 
  [ unlikely ] ( https://i.imgur.com/goo27w2.png )  lithuanians , like most other baltic/scandinavian cultures , have been known for being people of above average height . 
  at the end of the 19th century , the average height of males was 163.5 cm ( 5 ft 4 in ) and the average height of females was 153.3 cm ( 5 ft 0 in ) . 
  by the end of the 20th century , heights averaged 181.3 cm ( 5 ft 11 in ) for males and 167.5 cm ( 5 ft 6 in ) for females . 
  again , you 're talking non sense . 
  oh yes , i forgot about how we 're salty towards germans and austrian ... oh wait we are not . 
  it has nothing to do with medieval times , but russian empire and ussr 's oppressions and out right killings towards native lithuanians . 
  same way why poland was n't added to hre , it was way too powerful to be absorbed . 
  what 's pale to you is not pale to me . 
  [ umm , no ? 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/goo27w2.png ) what 's white for america , is not white for europe . 
  middle eastern in america are grouped together with europeans as caucasians . 
   very nice of you to provide training ground for these foreign militaries we are n't providing them anything , lithuanian and ally forces are training to prolong any invasion into lithuanian territory . 
  well because it is . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) sandwich with yoghurt , truly a happy ending . 
  you totally meant to say * we have \u0161akotis * !, 
  you forget that lithuanians are [ iron wolves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_wolf_ ( character \\ ) ) , after we drop the armour we run like cheetahs . 
  it 's not permanently stationed . 
  it 's rotational . 
  german/dutch/lithuanian / american armies train together . 
  also ukrainian language is closer to old church slavonic than belarusian is . 
  you 're talking total non sense right now . 
  they 're not white people . 
  well , at least our government is doing something , even if it is because to show middle finger to russia . 
  we love you too . 
  qajar persia was the other . 
  usa and lithuania are allies . 
  and it was our choice to invite them here and allow them to stay here . 
   as long as they stay on the other side of the border from us , i do n't have an issue with them  you should tell that to your own soldiers . 
  ei , we wanted to be next to poland , stupid sexy sweden , stealing all the polish girls !, 
  you 're making me confused ... 
  i do n't even ... what the fuck . 
  actually neither lithuanians ( no multi ethnicism/culturism ) nor belarusians ( no lithuanian overlords ) wanted united state after ww1 . 
  only if every ruler is lithuanian ruler , last time we gave you the wheel , you fucked it all up !, 
  sorry for [ that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9x5adywxeo ) , kebab , tasty kebab on spear ... 
  i want some kebab now !, 
  come here and let me eat you !, 
  stop running away !, 
  finland does n't exist . 
  nerf mountains . 
  when i see xix c. map it also hits me hard . 
  if it was n't for [ northern crusades ] ( https://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png ) , lithuania would n't have a reason to consolidate and expand towards south east . 
  you could have been into yurop ' but you fucked up . 
  [ can relate . 
   they were not your allies . 
  they were the same people as you - lithuanians . 
  no they were not . 
  scots are not englishmen , just because they share same country . 
  * while at the beginning the nobility was almost all lithuanian , with territorial expansion more ruthenian families joined lithuanian nobility . 
  as early as the 16th century , several ruthenian noble families began to call themselves [ gente ruthenus , natione lithuanus ] . 
  * -  lithuanian back then did not denote speakers of baltic language that were predecessors of modern lithuania . 
  lithuanian referred to inhabitants of the polity that was the grand duchy of lithuania . 
  including both baltic and slavic speakers . 
  ` lithuanian ' was a geographic distinction , one would refer to oneself as lithuanian , as somebody from mazovia would refer to themselves as mazovian . 
  they did n't have ethno-linguistic-nationalist constructs until 19th century . 
  slavic and jewish inhabits of gdl had different names . 
  baltic lithuanians were , well lithuanians , slavs were litvins , jews were litvaks , while prussian lithuanians were lietuvininkai . 
  foreign nations did n't distinct them , locals did . 
   they did n't have ethno-linguistic-nationalist constructs until 19th century . 
  no shit ? 
   by the end of the 15th century , the old baltic-lithuanian political class had thoroughly absorbed and integrated the east slavic ex-kievan rus ' ruthenian population ( proto-belarusians ) as well as their culture and customs into the new lithuanian political elite , and were already in the process of polonization . 
  even more no shit ? 
  besides you 're exaggerating lithuanian acceptance of ruthenization/polonization , only after union of lublin , did western baltic lithuanian territories had influx of foreign people after city was ravaged by wars and plague . 
  samogitia was the only region where nobles refused any polonization , which also consisted of biggest percentage of lithuanian nobility , around 12 % of total gdl 's / plc 's population . 
   so yes , it is complicated if you ask me . 
  the people , as well as the ruling class were an amalgamation of lots of things . 
  it is very difficult to unpack all these historical nuances to the lay person , especially when they likely know nothing about belarus beyond that it exists , and are familiar only with the modern country of lithuania . 
  that 's why it 's up to historians not local population . 
   you are right . 
  even in those times there were still many people in both poland and ex-lithuanian lands that had a desire to recreate the rzeczpospolita . 
  it was still living memory to them , even though nobody then was alive when poland-lithuania was last independent . 
  [ mostly only poles . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_polish_coup_d%27\u00e9tat_attempt_in_lithuania ), 
  yes . 
   well , it is more complicated . 
  belarusians has as much claim to the old grand duchy of lithuania as modern lithuania does . 
  why it 's complicated ? 
  we do not deny that belarusians played huge role in development of grand duchy of lithuania . 
  they were our closest allies back then . 
   if you compare lithuania + belarus now vs grand duchy of lithuania then , then suddenly it does not look like such a collosal change .
