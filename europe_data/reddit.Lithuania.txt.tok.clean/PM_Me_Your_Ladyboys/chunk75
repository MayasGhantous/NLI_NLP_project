  even then , after ww1 both states manage to re-establish as independent states ( before belarus got crushed by bolshevik forces ) , belarus did n't want to re-create gdl as it feared lithuanians will once again subjugate them , while lithuanians did n't want gdl to be re-created because we did n't want any of multi-culturism , since it was destroying our national identity . 
  i 'm talking about [ congress of lutsk ( year 1429 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_lutsk ) : * as discussed at the congress of lutsk , he was proclaimed king , and lithuania a kingdom , by sigismund , holy roman emperor , in 1430 , but the royal crown , which was sent by sigismund to vytautas , was intercepted by polish noblemen . 
  soon afterwards vytautas died , without being crowned as king . 
  * [ the deluge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_ ( history \\ ) ) was during second northern war ( mid xvii c. ) , during that time most of lithuanian nobility sided with swedes and wanted to break union with poland , while uniting with sweden under [ union of k\u0117dainiai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) . 
  i wish poland did n't interfere with crown deployment to vytautas the great , lithuania would been once again kingdom , maybe even empire , rather than pesky grand duchy . 
  [ republic of lithuania compare to grand duchy of lithuania ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xzyc6vu.jpg ) . 
  shh tiny croatia , accept personal union . 
  good old days . 
  xvi c. was date when pl-lt union was broken and renewed a lot of times . 
  that 's why pipeline is being built . 
  latvia , estonia , even lithuania share border with russia , but we were n't invaded , even though there threatened , it took ~ 3 more years to get every single russian soldier out of our countries , but we still pushed for it , we did n't fear russians , we already knew their brutality , far more than nazi one . 
  we learned from interwar that trying to be neutral will not work . 
  which is why i said it , it made poor choices during that time , unlike poland . 
  yeah , save korea , are not relatively new countries . 
  well ukraine broke free after fall of ussr , it was even richer than poland back then , but it made poor choices unlike poland . 
  ca n't you get more butthurt ? 
   these threads are connected , because ukraine is a former colony of russia , and , well , colonies are n't usually rich and successful countries , because , well , they 're colonies . 
  usa , canada , australia , korea are n't rich ? 
   you can keep being pro usa , but they are far away , [ their soldiers are not . 
  ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5703/22413217086_7499d841c4_o.jpg ), 
  because russia is losing allies as years pass by . 
  and no , i 'm not from usa , but i 'm pro usa . 
  yeah right lol , russia is a clown compare to usa . 
   good heavens russia is so incomprehensible . 
  [ so as in lithuania , either they fled or were imprisoned .

   no `` no-man 's land '' region like siberia there were natives in siberia you know ? 
  it was not no man 's land . 
   it is not . 
  but your anticulture is a cultural way to nowhere how am i anti cultural ? 
  i 'm in favour of keeping churches as cultural relics . 
   yes it has , because voters want it they do n't want it , you want it . 
  religion is biased on brainwashing people in masses , suppressing their rights . 
   no , i know them very well , they are one of reasons why this kingdom fell , that 's why we do n't want to make this mistake again . 
  it fell because of nobilities greed , not because of multi-culturism . 
  [ i love it . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/rvyzrsknv3w ), 
  if you want compare something to that of california or new mexico , compare it with siberia . 
  legally belongs to ukraine , that russia occupies . 
  i support self determination , but not when foreign force is within land . 
  you ca n't compare those two with crimea . 
   christian religion is cultural relic , it has no place in politics . 
   not on some multi-culti and political corectness . 
  are you forgetting kingdom of poland and polish-lithuanian commonwealth and it 's values ? 
  elect pagan lithuanian as your king . 
  [ hmm . 
   jews welcoming red army with flowers and in some cases attacking polish army units in 1939 when eastern poland was annexed kinda negate this . 
  they had strong communist sympathies before nazis were relevant . 
  same in lithuania , they were the only people in lithuania that actually supported red army 's invasion of lithuania . 
   popularity after wwi in eastern europe what are you talking about ? 
  everyone tried their hardest to contain communism . 
  oh , the blind fools they were . 
  after russia 's acknowledges that their country men almost exterminated latvian state ( reparations can be discussed later ) . 
  besides , what is has to do with latvia , we 're talking about lithuania and russia , where is our compensation for all the russians who committed war crimes ? 
  that 's why do not fear to call them economic migrants rather than refugees . 
  once you become millionaire it 's hard to find that kindred soul . 
  just like magical friends would appear . 
  meh , i have been so deep i fear nothing . 
  russia empire was aiming to annex romania so it could get closer to it 's original plan - taking over constantinople . 
  even after romania gained independence , russian imperial army roamed through romania . 
  he 's aracho pro-commie , says everything you need to know . 
  first step , do n't idolize ussr , second step , extradict war criminals that still hide within russia , third step , watch your neighbours opening friendly relations once more , like they did with germany . 
  never saw what you just said . 
  there is more chance that turkey will go russia 's way than uk . 
  jokes on you , we [ wanted to be swedes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) , hahahaaaahaa . 
  i 'm so alpha boys cling on me too . 
  [ yep ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nachman_dushanski ), 
  interesting person , too bad he was killed by the so called `` liberators '' . 
  he 's a boss , not an alpha . 
  yeah , right , that heartbeat is going for more than 50 years , maybe it 's dead ? 
  ewww ... 
  wait what , belarus has 1 % of population that practice incest , wth belarus . 
  alpha 's are not fat af .

  nato is not hostile towards russia , it 's russia who acts hostile towards nato . 
  stopping two genocidal and waring sides from committing war crimes against each other ... wow . 
  how so ? 
  does little estonia preparing plans on grand invasion of russia ? 
  honestly , you have some problems , not i. 
  triggering you is quite easy i see . 
  i 'm long ago graduated . 
  i just see no reason to talk with you , you have your own boxed agenda which i share nothing with , i rather not waste my time on you . 
   oh god , are n't you thick . 
  fucking google the name of the book , it 's literally the first pic of the statistics from that book in the google 's results . 
  did i say i disagree ? 
  soviets are the reason why such hell in lithuania even began . 
   a pussy bandit kills civilians that have no means to defend . 
  whole red army is pussy bandits .

  we need a lot of lng terminals , we already have one , which stopped russia from black mailing us with higher gas prices . 
  well antanas snie\u010dkus , sure liked to give middle finger to stalin too . 
  but then again , during documentary about lithuanian partisans , most soviet occupational soldiers would say lithuanian partisans were bandits , because of share brutality and how they dealt with soviets and their collaborationists . 
   why do you care only about annexations and european countries ? 
  because nato is european and north american alliance ? 
   nato invaded iraq , afghanistan , libya and syria . 
  nato supported coups in various countries . 
  nato supported warmonger georgian president .
