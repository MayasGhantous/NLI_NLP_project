  so that gives russia a green light ? 
  talking about whataboutism . 
   there 're many reasons not to trust and be afraid of nato . 
  [ like what ? 
  ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5703/22413217086_7499d841c4_o.jpg ), 
  after break up of ussr it took 3 extra years to get their soldiers out of our soil , one might say they were preparing to annex our countries yet again . 
  when madvedev was president of russia , he suggest for us to leave nato , in return they would give us far cheaper gasses ... 
   nato expansion happened like that 's a bad thing ? 
   a russian invasion of the baltic states is pure fantasy , they have nothing to gain there . 
  just like ukraine , georgia , moldova , right ? 
  yeah right , georgia , moldova , ukraine such valuable countries for russia to occupy ... rofl . 
  the only reason it has n't touched us is because we 're part of eu and nato , thank god for that . 
  it took 9 years for ussr to crush lithuanian underground freedom fighters . 
   besides i meant that the word murder implies unlawfulness of an act of killing , which would not be the case . 
  you wan na know why russians were n't so keen to relocate here ? 
  our partisans not only killed occupational force , but everyone who collaborated with them . 
  if they were about to get caught , they would pull grenades pin a blow it next to their faces , so soviets could n't identify them and go for their families . 
  that 's roman province territory , not actual [ kingdom of macedonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/macedonia_overview.svg/556px-macedonia_overview.svg.png ) . 
  actually only small tip of southern fyrom has actual macedonian kingdom borders . 
  i 'm more than happy and thankful for people who fought against ussr 's occupation . 
   oh please , it will be the exact same as the current eu . 
  france and germany dominate . 
  especially since uk left . 
  this is pure myth , i do n't know where people get this from . 
  do people forget that belgian federal region of wallonia blocked ceta ( eu and canadian free trade deal ) ? 
   really ? 
  news to me , they seemed to have a respectable army pre cold war ending . 
  does n't seem like uk/fra military is a joke . 
  or perhaps germany slashed the military budget to nothing purposely . 
  germany has a big surplus on gdp , they could pool a lot of money into army and would become yet again largest military power in europe , but they are not doing so , because there is no need so , people in germany are brainwashed into not liking their own military . 
   on paper . 
  do n't forget you 're also losing your best military in 2 years . 
  also integration will take decades . 
  umm , no . 
  [ european armies are already integrated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union ) , the only thing is left is to establish [ eu military hq which uk not long ago blocked ] ( https://euobserver.com/foreign/137916 ) , they 're the reason why eu 's army have n't been a thing yet for several decades . 
   and i show distrust in the state of most european 's military , especially germany 's . 
  which is why european army would n't be led by germany or any other nation , it would be led by different branch of eu , something similar to eurozone . 
   the fact is germany and most european countries let their military go to shit after the cold war and only usa/uk/fra is left to pick up the slack . 
  german was forced to make it 's army pretty much a joke . 
  which is why i want united european army and not freeriding usa 's taxpayer money . 
  if every single eu member state pooled it 's army we would already be third largest military power . 
   so why change what 's worked ? 
  you can not seriously look at that poll and somehow believe that usa is the unreliable ally in nato . 
  i do n't want to change it , or replace it , it may exist . 
  but i just want european army , that would protect every member state , instead of relying on usa , look at uk , brexit happened , who says usa might not elect a guy who will actually say that usa is leaving nato behind , unlikely , but possible in future . 
  the key words to european union is ever closer union , which involves military . 
   you think germans would magically want to defend eastern europe because instead of their own army it would be an eu army ? 
  germans are n't the only ones that would be part of united european army , germans are already on our soil , protecting us from russia 's claw which already mutilated ukraine , georgia and moldova . 
   please try and spin this further in the direction of distrust of nato and usa versus the reality of western europe 's reluctance to defend eastern europe . 
  i do n't show distrust in nato or usa , i show distrust in their idiotic leadership . 
   ask eastern europeans which countries they would trust to answer the call to arms . 
  trying to lump up `` eastern europeans '' as one , that have one opinion is idiotic , we have different culture , values and turst in different countries . 
  i 'm not against nato as it 's the reason why our region has n't been fucked by russia , but i rather prefer european army guarding my ass . 
   distrust nato alliance  create united european army . 
  trump 's opinion would seize to be relevant for us . 
  yes you would , you 're brave armchair soldier . 
  wasting taxes , yes , spreading misery , no . 
  if you want to blame someone , blame yourself , you 're human , just like rest of us . 
   this russia fearmongering is leading to nowhere fear warmongering , yet you support occupation of e. europe . 
  what soldiers are for ? 
  gardening flowers ? 
  thank god german people are n't as stupid as you . 
   also there is less common culture and history than between the western european nations [ umm , no ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg/683px-grossgliederung_europas-en.svg.png ) . 
  i can name far more similarities with germany than russia . 
  yes , i was elected sexiest , most flamboyant boy in the hood , feel my rainbow !, 
  because he pretends that he stands for polish minority , while in back scene he 's a puppet controlled through strings . 
  back in 2002 ( 3 ) we elected new president - rolandas paksas  on 26 february 2003 his term as a president began . 
  during his term , concerns arose that he had ties to the russian mafia . 
  yuri borisov , president of the aviation company avia baltika , had donated $ 400,000 to his campaign , and was given lithuanian citizenship by paksas ' decree . 
  this decree was later ruled to be unconstitutional by constitutional court of lithuania . 
  paksas ' connections were investigated by the department of security . 
  in early 2004 , the seimas started impeachment proceedings against him . 
  on 31 march 2004 the constitutional court of lithuania found him guilty of violating the constitution and his oath of office . 
  on 6 april 2004 , the parliament ( seimas ) voted on three charges : that he had leaked classified information about his investigation to borisov ; that he had improperly restored borisov 's citizenship ; and that he had interfered in a privatization transaction . 
  the vote passed , effectively removing paksas from the presidency lithuanians are super pro-western . 
  russian ties would only bring you a political suicide , unless you manage to mask it like w. toma\u0161evski . 
  yeah , adding gotland would be insanely valuable strategic location when it comes to defending us . 
  you would , so would germans . 
  mostly poles , who think he stand for poles , while in fact he 's just a puppet , a useful idiot for kremlin . 
  he tries to find what ever loophole he can find to stir things up between poles and lithuanians e.g. 
  divide us . 
  russians in lithuania are far different from russians in latvia and estonia . 
  and poles in lithuania are n't pro-russian , this [ guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valdemar_toma\u0161evski ) is . 
  lithuania does n't have large russian minority ... 
  due to external intervention . 
  and it does matter , it 's history . 
   it does n't matter at all because the country has n't existed for hundreds of years . 
  plc existed for 226 years . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  german people , not german government and soldiers . 
   do note which word comes first in the name of that country , the fact that a leader of one part is a king and another is a duke like that honestly matters even a bit ? 
   the nationality of the king [ swedes ? 
  hungarians ? 
  french ? 
  lithuanians ? 
  poles ? 
  germans ?

  i guess russian empire under peter the great was france 's vassal , after all he was huge francophile . 
  except we were [ one country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_commonwealth ) and had [ one identity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) , unless swiss , belgians , british do n't exist in your opinion .
