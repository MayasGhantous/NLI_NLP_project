   putin is using the '' alternative history '' from russia for propaganda reasons and dreams of a new ussr . 
  russian empire , not ussr . 
  yes we do remember occupying moscow , good old times . 
  thank god once uk is out , we can move towards full european army . 
  nice from you for making sure that we should distrust nato alliance . 
  what it has to do with russia ? 
  even then you 're blowing up ukrainians in eastern ukraine . 
  i wish europe had also a joint navy , that way we could go full japan/australia towards european union 's maritime border . 
  i 'm with you buddy . 
  steal vilnius and watch us go full ira !, 
  i guess you 're right , russia 's / ussr 's army was always known for zerging rather than out-smarting enemy . 
  [ oh yes , those were the days ... ] ( https://youtu.be/v2umn5mxyqu?t=13 ), 
  not a problem for ussr though . 
  uranus is a beautiful thing . 
  impossible when you sit between soviets and nazi germany . 
  lithuanian lands were becoming more and more polonized , catholics lithuanians were in danger of losing their cultural identity as a nation and becoming just yet another province . 
  after * constitution of may 3 , 1791 * , the country itself was officially renamed from the republic to commonwealth of poland , with some high autonomy towards `` lithuanian '' lands . 
  prussian lithuanians from lithuania minor who were lutheran have more work on their hands on preserving lithuanian language and literature than catholics lithuanians from lithuanian proper . 
   the partitions divided the ethnicities of the republic which is good , else we would have disappeared just like old prussians under germans . 
   it sure would be better for us if it survived into the 19th century not so much for us . 
  the problem was not an army , but money . 
  we could have taken all of livonia after beating swedes in battle of kircholm . 
  first time i see polish being so pessimistic about plc , i thought it was our job . 
  i commented on good old days when our military was powerful , but for some reason we have to argue about how bad plc was ... everyone knows plc was pretty much meant to be destroyed . 
  the less people idolize ussr the better . 
  what ? 
  i represent myself and most lithuanians , you would be a fool to think we 're not appreciating usa 's help to secure our region . 
   teutonindahood [ triggered . 
   sure it is , it which language does this eu army speak ? 
  english . 
  you know , it 's mandatory foreign language in school and is used within european armies , especially if you seek career in army , you must speak english on b2 ( highest ) level . 
   because we know the ah empire army was completely useless because the soldiers could n't cooperate because of the different nationalities . 
  eu = / = imperialistic a-h . you ca n't compare these two at all . 
  look at ussr ( which had far more different nationalities than a-h ) and tell me how it 's army was complete shit during ww2 . 
  russians were only half of population and russian army loss was only half of ussr 's total army loss . 
   who 's the political leader of this eu army ? 
  we know that decisiveness is key in war . 
  not long ago uk blocked blueprint for eu military hq . 
  european army is already intertwined . 
  glorious yurop ' has everything !, 
  [ exactly . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union ), 
  that depends which countries would join the project . 
  and several decades , that 's really pessimistic view . 
  not really , eu army was a thing for quite some time , the only reason it have n't happened is because uk was blocking it all the time . 
  eu remember armies are already inter connected . 
  they would n't . 
  if eu army happened one day , we would be 3rd strongest military in the world . 
  welcome to / r/russia,

  because turkey holds as strategic location that would empower russian black sea fleet . 
  [ good old days .

  rather a cold war relic . 
  given your current erdoturd , i doubt that it is not impossible , after all he shot down russian aircraft , he has some balls in him to make huge stunts , just like putin . 
  do not take words from him too seriously , he does n't represent all europeans . 
  we love amerika . 
  they 're the reason why we joined . 
  he 's right . 
   block our people from their international rights to vote . 
  vote on bringing death sentence , unlike you we 're civilized countries who are only going forward , not backwards , like turkey does . 
  edit : warning , freshly baked new `` troll '' acc with turkish flair , would n't take anything from him seriously . 
  that 's sub us filled with one sided people and you can guess which side they always take . 
  i think they 're trying to communicate , guys , what do we do ? 
  these are aliens , we do n't talk about aliens . 
  are n't we all indo-europeans ? 
  it was never an option , i 'm baltic pagan lithuanian , heil perk\u016bnas . 
   well , well , who is the russian now marius ? 
  i am not russian .

  what 's wrong with hammer and sickle or swastika ?

  it will become luxembourg 's ally , everyone knows luxembourg is preparing to invade all of europe . 
  those crazy sea doggies are taking revenge for what canadians have committed !, 
  polish language in nutshell . 
  damn, 
  as one guy said here once , some of us are homophobic but not barbaric . 
   the 7th stanza of * lietuvininks we are born * was dedicated to german emperor wilhelm i ( lithuanian : wilius i ), 
  what ever you say buddy . 
  greeks likes to scheme as long as money flows from eu . 
   germany is home to the only lithuanian school in western europe . 
  [ me right now . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gudccey09tm ), 
  german influence best influence . 
   lithuania ah , good ol' days when lithuania and germany were neighbours . 
  ussr 's occupation did n't leave a good taste of totalitarianism . 
  and the reason why estonia and latvia are lower than lithuania is probably due to russian minority . 
  okay ... what ever floats your boat .
