  if spanish do n't want to die for bulgarians , do n't expect bulgarians to fight for spanish ceuta . 
   the eu has to federalise before it creates a joint european army . 
  which britain is blocking right now . 
  and i hope after brexit , eu finally can start talks about federalisation . 
  this first issue does n't exist yet . 
  holy shit , do you even read what i write ? 
  if you do n't want to pay 2 % to eu 's military , then you can opt-the-fuck-out of it .

  mini lukashenka 1 million rubles .

  oh , i probably assume every single one of them is insanely corrupt given today 's ukrainian economical situation . 
   anyways , what 's some good lithuanian food . 
  no borscht or potato dumplings tho . 
  hmm . 
  [ kold\u016bnai ] ( http://www.sepc.lt/softlanding/images/stories/cuisine/dumplings.jpg ) , [ kugelis ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dxdxctk.jpg ) ( with either meat or cottage cheese in ) , [ v\u0117darai ] ( http://www.gaspadine.lt/uploads/modules/recipes/fullsize/5748.jpg ) , [ kibinai / \u010cebur\u0117kai ] ( http://g3.dcdn.lt/images/pix/kibinai-63967558.jpg ) ( which is rather lipka tatar cusine ) , [ kepta duona ] ( http://www.gaspadine.lt/uploads/modules/recipes/thumb280x180/7415.jpg ) ( bathed in cheese ) , [ suktiniai ] ( http://www.receptai.lt/uploads/modules/recipes/thumb380x250/8976.jpg ) ( which is similar to sushi ) , [ gulia\u0161as ] ( http://www.receptai.lt/uploads/modules/recipes/fullsize/5991.jpg ) , [ lithuanian cr\u00eapes ] ( http://www.sepc.lt/softlanding/images/stories/cuisine/crepes.jpg ) ( pancakes with sausages or bananas ) , [ var\u0161k\u0117 ] ( http://www.sepc.lt/softlanding/images/stories/cuisine/cottage-cheese.jpg ) ( cottage cheese ) , [ spurgos ] ( http://www.sepc.lt/softlanding/images/stories/cuisine/spurgos.jpg ) ( home made doughnuts ) . 
  to top on that with some sweet , sweet [ \u0160akotis ] ( http://www.sepc.lt/softlanding/images/stories/cuisine/sakotis.jpg ) , while drinking home brew kvass if you 're a child or beer/vodka if you 're adult . 
  lithuania is rich in verity of kvass , beer and vodka . 
   similar to khampa tibetans , although they have abeen known for their height throughout history . 
  no idea what they eat up in the mountains probably high variety of food . 
   i read lipka tatars are wealthy as fuck in eastern europe . 
  eastern europe at that time was n't that populated as southern and western europe . 
  and as i said due to their service in gdl as i said they would be rewarded with land . 
   interesting . 
  some teutonic knights also fought on the side of the grand duchy of lithuania against temur and edigu during the battle of the vorskla river iirc for a huge price :   vytautas gathered a large army which included lithuanians , ruthenians , poles , moldavians , and wallachians . 
  to enlist support from the teutonic knights , vytautas signed the treaty of salynas , surrendering samogitia to the knights . 
  though we would reconquer it back later . 
  samogitia is western half of modern lithuania . 
  edit :  do polish or lithuanian neo nazis repsect lipka tatars ? 
  neo-nazis are insanely small minority in lithuania , but i would assume they do n't respect them at all . 
  they 're too big and as you said , way too religious . 
   we can base our common nordic identity on anti-russian sentiment . 
  i prefer actually [ baltoscandia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltoscandia ) idea , than anti-russian alliance . 
  well , i pretty much agree on this . 
  that might be because of first people on lithuanian soil appeared 10k years aka the o.g northern europeans after last ice cap over northern europe finally melted . 
  +5 k years to past indo-europeans that came with [ corded ware culture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corded_ware_culture ) and started to mix with local communities . 
  since then germanic , slavic , baltic etc nations started to form . 
  but even then , it 's probably a suppressed gene given : [ blond hair/light eye pattern ] ( https://i.imgur.com/goo27w2.png ) and  lithuanians , like most other baltic/scandinavian cultures , have been known for being people of above average height . 
  at the end of the 19th century , the average height of males was 163.5 cm ( 5 ft 4 in ) and the average height of females was 153.3 cm ( 5 ft 0 in ) . 
  by the end of the 20th century , heights averaged 181.3 cm ( 5 ft 11 in ) for males and 167.5 cm ( 5 ft 6 in ) for females . 
  even then i 'd like to note that mongolian empire ( specifically golden horde ) was neighbour of grand duchy of lithuania . 
  after we took control of all fallen kievan rus ' we became allies , and we started to recruit tatars and other turkic/mongolian mercenaries to fight for us , in return we awarded them with piece of land within gdl . 
  they would be known as lipka tatars ( literally lithuanian tatars as in their language ) , their descendants would even fight for napoleon 's grand armee in trying to conquer russia . .  tokhtamysh escaped to the grand duchy of lithuania and asked vytautas for assistance in regaining his power over the horde . 
  in exchange for such assistance , he offered his suzerainty over the rus ' lands . 
  edigu defeated tokhtamysh and vytautas at the battle of the vorskla river in 1399 . 
  the trade routes never recovered from timur 's destruction , and tokhtamysh died in obscurity in 1405 . 
  his son jalal al-din fled to lithuania . 
  while in lithuania , he fought in the battle of grunwald against the teutonic order . 
   edigu forced the grand prince of moscow to accept the khan 's supremacy in 1408 . 
  seeing tatar commoners selling their children into slavery as damaging to both the manpower and the prestige of the golden horde 's army , edigu and his puppet khan prohibited the slave trade at a kurultai . 
  despite some rebellions of genghisid princes , he kept the horde united until 1410 when he was expelled to central asia . 
   while he was absent , jalal al-din returned from lithuania and briefly took the throne . 
  edigu returned to the horde and set up his ordo in crimea , challenging the sons of tokhtamysh before his murder in 1419 . 
  well in lithuania gorby is n't seen in a good light either , since * january events * . 
  you know nothing , jon snow . 
  oh look , an actual xenophobe . 
   putin : [ chuckles ~ ~ sovieticly ~ ~ tsaricly ], 
  my pleasure . 
   tell me , how accurate is romuva compared to what the pagan lithuanians under vytautas and gediminas would 've practiced ? 
  other than the abscence now of tribal warbands giving up a third of their spoils to the temple of divas :p romuva is rather biased specifically on peasant life in pagan times . 
  since most of nobility accepted christianity after union of krewo , out side * samogitia - \u017demaitija - lithuanian lowlands/western lithuania * which was most rebelling region against teutonic order 's occupation and within grand duchy of lithuania , that 's why instead of becoming voivodeship , it was made into eldership after union of lublin ( creating polish-lithuanian commonwealth ) , they were last region within gdl to be christianized . 
   how much of pagan lithuanian cultural practices survive in the modern era ? 
  such festivals include v\u0117lin\u0117s ( day of dead souls , common with celtic halloween ) , u\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s ( festival when winter ends and spring begins ) , and rasos or jonin\u0117s . 
  for u\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s , people in samogitia may dress in costumes including masks and burn an idol of an old lady , called mor\u0117 or giltine , goddess of death . 
  -  and can you recommend a good book about pagan lithuania other than ` lithuania ascending : a pagan empire etc. . . '' ? 
  i do n't think there is one out side history books . 
  i can only suggest * the reconstruction of nations : poland , ukraine , lithuania , belarus , 1569 -- 1999 * book . 
  - edit : there is book named * litva : the rise and fall of the grand duchy of lithuania : a selection from vanished kingdoms * by norman davies , but i had never read it , plus i think the writer could be holding some bias ( because of his polish heritage ) . 
  * lithuania past and present * by e.j. 
  harrison , too , but then again , i have n't read them , so i do n't know how much truth there is in it . 
  maybe when japan joins ? 
  same as ukraine , georgia or moldova . 
  unlimited bureaucracy !!, 
  well only in those countries where education is absolute crap . 
  [ satan is my homie .

  why ? 
  it 's explicitly about soldiers who blindly fallowed orders . 
  pyrotechnics is rammstein style , plus it would n't fit with carolus rex . 
  i do n't know but there is meme that lithuanians intentionally send shit songs to lose .

  revisionism is next step for erdogan . 
   that 's a nice island . 
  is that a luxury boat ? 
  i always thought that old castles would make for amazing luxury homes . 
  ca n't really tell if it 's luxury boat . 
  and i do n't think you can privatize medieval castle . 
   was the conversion from pagan to christian peaceful or no ? 
  i am wondering why sometimes it is forced and other times it is through peaceful missionaries . 
  yes and no , it 's complicated . 
  * northern crusades * were meant to spread christianity by force through eastern shores of baltic sea that were the last pagan bastions . 
  * teutonic order * successfully occupied old prussia , while * livonian brothers of the sword * modern day estonia and latvia .
