  lithuanians were the only pagans that manage to repel both * teutonic order * from the west and * livonian order * from the north . 
  two most notable battles would be [ saul\u0117s m\u016b\u0161is ( battle of sun ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_saule ) and [ \u017dalgirio m\u016b\u0161is ( battle of green forest ) ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017dalgirio_m\u016b\u0161is ) . 
  several decades after * livonian * defeat in battle of saule , mindaugas would become first and only king of lithuania as he formally accepted lithuanian to be christianized by livonian monks to end war with teutonic order . 
  that actually did n't stop teutonic order as their goal for christianization switched to total domination of territories , which funnily enough meant attacking fellow christian nation that invited them to deal with the pagans - poland . 
  after it was clear war will not end against to order , all lithuanian nobles and mindaugas himself reverted back to pagan faith . 
  after assassination of mindaugas , lithuania was enrolled in several civil wars , though it did n't stop the expansion ( [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbpa4ilbjq8 ) is simplified version of lithuanian expansionism until partitions when lithuania was erased from political map , sadly it 's in lithuanian language , but then again , you can listen how lithuanian language sounds ) . 
  due to mindaugas having no heir , lithuania lost it 's kingdom status and became grand duchy again even though every grand duke referred themselves as king when writing to pope and so on . 
  since lithuania and poland had common enemy , our alliance with each other grew till it reached union of krewo , when grand duke of lithuania married polish queen ( officially king ) jadwiga , which connected lithuania and poland into personal union which meant second christianization of lithuania through polish priests , which was the stepping ground for common lithuanian and polish culture until it even manage to developed into new identity - [ polish-lithuanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) , even though our languages and ethnicity are different from each other which was the biggest reason why after ww1 lithuania did n't want to be in union again with poland , it actually was killing our nationality . 
  - as i said , it 's complicated . 
  we took christianity by war and by peaceful means . 
  hmm , interesting to see * lithuania * on 1872 map . 
  it 's still in investigation , m. gorbachev was asked to testify as witness , but i do n't think that he will ever do . 
  even today russia is protecting ( refusing to extradict for court ) soldiers who committed atrocities towards lithuanian people . 
  their official stance is : '' * the soviet troops did not use their weapons at all * '' . 
  are n't welsh/scots and english competing separately ? 
  yeah , sadly , he is our citizen ... 
  for historical sites , i would suggest : [ trakai castle ] ( http://www.amazingplacesonearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/trakai-island-castle.jpg ) , [ hill of crosses ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/colina_de_las_cruces%2c_lituania%2c_2012-08-09%2c_dd_02.jpg/1280px-colina_de_las_cruces%2c_lituania%2c_2012-08-09%2c_dd_02.jpg ) , [ vilnius old town ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/vilnius_ostrobramska.jpg/1024px-vilnius_ostrobramska.jpg ) , [ curonian spit ] ( https://img.lrytas.lt/show_foto/?f=4&amp;id=336265&amp;s=20 ) . 
  some facts about ** lithuania ** : lithuanian language is most archaic of all indo-european languages . 
  - lithuanian language , together with latvian are the only two surviving baltic languages in indo-european language group . 
  - last pagan state to become christian . 
  - a place where [ * northern crusades * ] ( https://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png ) happened other than middle east . 
  - together with poland defeated and destroyed teutonic order and created duchy of prussia , which would be a state that would win franco-prussian war and austro-prussian war to unify germany . 
  - polish-lithuanian commonwealth successful occupied all of russia . 
  - during plc era ( 1569-1795 ) our king was elected by nobility e.g. 
  nobles ' republic in age of monarchy . 
  - plc had biggest percentage of nobility ( 10 % ) in all of europe . 
  - had first in europe and second to world ( after usa ) constitution - * constitution of may 3 , 1791 * . 
  eu - greatest thing that ever happened to my country and european continent . 
   what are your favourite songs from that ? 
  probably finland 's * lordi - hard rock hallelujah * from 2006 eurovision . 
   what do you guys think of an eu army vis-a-vis nato and your own countries military ? 
  i support eu army . 
  even though our nation is small i support my nation 's military plans on expanding budget and conscription , as given we 're small , guerilla warfare is the only possible way to defend against possible russian invasion . 
   is n't it redundant ? 
  is an eu army more acceptable to some countries who are not in nato ? 
  if so why ? 
  rather those that are in nato are more likely to be part of eu army , since nato members already have joint military excises . 
  it has nothing to do with badness , but the word - murderer . 
  i really hate the fact that most of the songs are in english . 
  most likely waldemar tomaszewski and his fellow parasites . 
  murderer is a murderer no matter the number , as long as it exceeds at least 0 . 
  numbers do n't matter , both are killers that likes thing to be made in most brutal fashion . 
  so i should now kneel to russians and thank them for not keeping their occupation force in our countries ? 
  they did n't gave us shit , fall of ussr is what made us independent , the rotting oppressive empire finally fell after it could n't keep up with the west . 
  either way , he did not give us freedom , west did . 
  gorbachev tried to suppress it . 
  when it did n't ? 
  he literally ordered tanks to crush unarmed civilians . 
  i prefer neither , both are animals . 
   does it also commonly practice denial of substantial participation in the holocaust ? 
  unlike russia , we do not deny history , yes around 200 lithuanians participated in mass killing of lithuanian jews , does that make us eternally fascist nation ? 
  besides you forget one thing , ussr killed half of estonian jews during first soviet occupation , so here is that . 
   who needs toilet paper if your country is a military superpower , right ? 
  pretty much says everything about soviet union 's economy and why it went to shit . 
  evil capitalists are not fictional ? 
   there is reason for him to be viewed favorably . 
  because he slaughtered only half of poland ? 
  either pro-commies or ex-commies that were brainwashed during commie times . 
  the country was already weak and shaky , death of ussr was only matter of time . 
  why should estonians , latvians , lithuanians love occupational force ? 
  he did [ that in lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania \\ ) ) , before west started to scream to piss off from lithuania . 
  would suggest to watch [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/yqfbkjnryn0?t=1 ) . 
  so what now ? 
  we should kiss his ass ? 
  he deserves to burn in hell as much as any other soviet leader . 
  hilarious actually . 
  of course they are , does n't mean we 're one branch . 
  the similarities could have evolved due to close contacts or proto-slavs just branching out of baltic language group . 
  now i see why we were closest allies . 
  what you said , makes no sense at all . 
  comparing apples to oranges . 
  i 'm specifically referring to balto-slavic theory , it 's as much credible as slavic languages just being mutated baltic languages . 
  because i looked it up , persian language has same root , besides , i really do n't like usage of balto-slavic branch theory , because , well , it 's a theory . 
  1000 years , until earth 's reich . 
  you clearly meant indo-european . 
  sounds like * \u017diema * which is * winter * . 
  and what [ eu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxuty7ss1v4 ) is again ? 
  if they talk about modern german as past germany they clearly lost their mind . 
  * now that our time has come to fight * * scotland must unite * * we 'll make a stand on stirling ground * * to put a challenge to the crown * * we are one , we have come * * we 're here to break and end the occupation * * we have our nation 's fate in hand * * it 's time we make our final stand *, 
  if we 're talking about plates , then there is no europe at all , india/arabia , caribbean are their own continent , blah blah blah . 
  are you telling me southern most italy is actually africa ? 
   islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world 's land into geopolitical regions . 
  * delusion * , that 's the only word i can give to brexiters . 
   although there are alternative gas routes through lithuania iirc . 
  yeah we have lng terminal . 
  finnic empire . 
  it was the days when uk was still a superpower , of course brexiters will be bragging about it . 
  glorious baltic race . 
  geography is not one of your strongest things , is it ? 
   it lies 80 km ( 50 mi ) south of italy , 284 km ( 176 mi ) east of tunisia , and 333 km ( 207 mi ) north of libya . 
  no it ca n't . 
  turkey has been on eu 's doorstep since what 60 's ? 
  and look how much improvement they made since then , not a lot . 
  time to fight for your freedom !, 
  what ever floats your boat , little guy . 
  and all thanks to communism that made our economy stagnate for 50 years , but now with eurofunds our economy is recovering , given nordic investments etc. 
  we should at least catch , not surpass , but catch up . 
  we 're already above greece , portugal . 
  for at least 1000 years . 
  i 'm genuinely asking , if you 're so educated with western and eastern economics through centuries , why do n't you expand more on this as true intellectual would do ?
