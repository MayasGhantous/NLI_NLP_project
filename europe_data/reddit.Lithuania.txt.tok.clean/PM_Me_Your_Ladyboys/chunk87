  that 's a myth , germany is of course biggest benefiter of union because surprise , it sits in middle of europe and it has great relationship with every european nation , unlike somebody . 
  yes , i know . 
  we wanted to try , our president was for fighting , our government feared that soviet will be more brutal during occupation if we resisted . 
  there was no other way to win , other than ally ourselves with hitler , but we already told him `` go fuck yourself '' when he suggested us to invade poland from the north . 
  why do you think he so willing to exchanged us for parts of poland ? 
  wait you 're comparing eu to nazi germany/ussr , get a grip on your mental state . 
  then again , common ivan is not putin , he does n't seek to enslave nations once again . 
  sure they did . 
  compare what ? 
  apples and oranges , finland manage to kick soviet ass back , we were too small , our geographical location already sucked balls . 
  if by shit talking you mean bowing , i do n't know in what world you live in . 
  agree . 
  but given how butthurt france was after franco-prussian war , but still did nothing , it fuels my doubts . 
  doubtful , soviet russia might existed , but not soviet union , since ukraine would be independent . 
  nope , that does n't change my statement , actually you finally agreed to it . 
  assumption , great way to bend facts . 
  besides laf are not viewed as heroes , they 're known for their extreme right wing views . 
  i mean , there is a reason our relations are in a bad shape . 
  while wehrmacht army was drugged . 
  still , soviets invaded us first and started killing from old to child in near forests . 
  i understand , after all white rus ' part of ostland was a place where all unwanted would be placed and exterminated , i 'm not here to defend nazis or anything , but just like soviets were less brutal to you than nazis , nazis were less brutal to us than soviets . 
  nazi germany also returned capital to us , should we also now bow to them ? 
  source ? 
  do n't try to use logic with commies , they do n't know what it is . 
  killing people were central ideology of communism , look at ussr , china , n. korea , vietnam , cuba etc. 
  the only difference is that nazis wanted to exterminate other nationalities , commies wanted to exterminate their own people . 
  if ussr would n't have fallen we also would have seized to exist . 
  ussr wanted to exterminate us too , do you even know what sovietization is ? 
  you shook each others hand and traded newly acquired polish territory . 
  that 's not a useless fact , it just shows true face of those `` liberators '' . 
  let it go , he 's most likely educated with `` their '' version of facts . 
  so brainwashed , jesus . 
  days after red army has crossed our border and started killing our people , including politicians ( e.g. 
  rainiai massacre ) :  on july 14 -- 15 , 1940 , ** rigged parliamentary elections ** for the `` people 's parliaments '' were conducted by local communists loyal to the soviet union . 
  because of ** newly installed election restrictions , only the communists and their allies were effectively allowed to run ** . 
  the election results were completely ** fabricated ** to give the communists large majorities : ** the soviet press service released them early , with the result that they had already appeared in print in a london newspaper a full 24 hours before the polls closed ** . 
  when korean war started soviets and americans did n't come into middle and did n't shake each others hands like soviet and nazis did in middle of poland . 
  poland was taking back what tsarist russia has stolen 123 years ago . 
  so does russia . 
  even today they protect animals who drove tanks over unarmed lithuanian civilians during january ' events . 
  and now by russian historians , they 're starting to re-write history books . 
  wehrmacht was known for it 's discipline here , soviets are known for barbarisms , like washing their faces with toilet water . 
  which is exactly why japan is n't celebrating usa 's victory . 
  then again , japan did same shit . 
  one wrong does not nullify other . 
  do n't mind him , he 's blinded . 
  yes , i forgot , lithuania is tyrannical nation . 
  either one or other will fall , they do n't work together . 
  not , but knowing russia 's history , it never came for charity or for just `` help '' , it always had it 's interest in expanding as much as possible , after all when romania was freed and united it still had tsarist boot sitting in their land . 
  yes , but then again , they 're the ones that helped to contain it . 
  doubtful . 
   can you show us on this doll where did evil russians touch you ? 
  not me , but at least 2 million german women , and other e. european female pows . 
   mostly out of charity . 
  russia was very religious at that time and idea of freeing orthodox brothers from muslim yoke was very popular . 
  oh wait you 're serious . 
  hahahahahaaa, 
   you were occupied later , not when you got vilnius . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  red army invaded us and occupied , since first soviet occupation they included vilnius region because of [ molotov-ribbentrop ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/ribbentrop-molotov.svg/1024px-ribbentrop-molotov.svg.png ) pact . 
   that 's the extent of german involvement , not the number of lithuanian participants . 
  please , go read and learn history . 
  ypatingasis b\u016brys - 50 to 200 were part of it , that probably had most blood on it 's hands . 
  no , it actually would n't . 
  because both germany and other nations would have supported whites on far larger scale , which would mean reds would never win civil war . 
  actually yes , i do agree , lithuanians fought for 9 years after ww2 in partisan war against ussr , hoping that one day americans and western allies will come for them . 
  thank god for that . 
  maybe we should justify nazi crimes too ? 
  since you know nazi scientist were the ones that worked in rocket engines ? 
  and commies robbed last cent of yours . 
  if you stayed capitalist i 'm sure you would have improved , now soviets set you on stagnation maybe even degradation . 
  commies do n't know what is `` learning from history '' , that 's all . 
  let 's ignore the fact that france and britain did n't feel like making an alliance when ussr asked for it prior to german negotiations . 
  so democratic nations not wanting to ally themselves with totalitarian dictatorship , with garbage ideology , that starves it 's people to death are now magically guilty for ussr allying with nazi germany ? 
  that 's pretty much what they were . 
   that soviets were just wild and uncivilized rapers from the east . 
  like they are n't today ? 
  lol  russia freed bulgaria from turkey not out of charity , but to remove ottoman influence while expanding russian influence over balkans . 
  would been pretty hard , everyone were already exhausted by the war and ussr had insanely large conventional army . 
  to prevent that , usa had to stay out of ww1 and let germany win . 
  then do n't call soviets liberators of baltics , they did same shit sovietization ( russifcation ) and replacement of lithuanians , latvians estonians with russians , just in a lot slower pace , so world would n't see shit . 
   did n't have long term plans to exterminate they did had such plans aka sovietzation , during fall of ussr , latvia was already becoming minority in it 's own country while russians tripled . 
  i 'm not trying to convince that we 're aryan , i 'm trying to convince that nazi logic skewed over time and their `` nordic race '' was skewed too . 
  after all hitler wanted lithuania to be it 's ally , it even suggest a joint invasion against poland to regain vilnius region , which we respectfully refused since we stand on strict neutrality , sadly it bit to our ass fallowing year with first soviet occupation . 
  what 's the point of having vilnius if we 're occupied by ussr ? 
  there was saying since first soviet occupation : `` vilnius m\u016bs\u0173 , o mes rus\u0173 '' - `` vilnius is ours , and we belong to russians '' . 
   only 139 personnel til few hundred people makes us a nazi nation . 
  war is a cruel parent , but an effective teacher . 
  i 'm not saying it was a right thing to do , but japan asked it for themselves and not surrendering instantly after first nuke was stupidity of the emperor . 
  ypatingasis b\u016brys - around 50 members who in most cases were prisoners , that been imprisoned for nazi activities during interwar period , damn til we 're nazi nation . 
   shame that ze germans were planning to kill and/or deport half the estonians and latvians and the vast majority of the lithuanians then again wast majority of generalbezirk included a lot of majority of ethnically polish territories , so for lithuania numbers were inflated . 
  [ read ] ( http://www.lituanus.org/1956/56_3_02drunga.html ) . 
  there was an argue between nazis in the berlin and reichskommissars in the baltics . 
  for a good [ reason ] ( https://i.imgur.com/goo27w2.png ) . 
   lithuanians , like most other baltic/scandinavian cultures , have been known for being people of above average height . 
  at the end of the 19th century , the average height of males was 163.5 cm ( 5 ft 4 in ) and the average height of females was 153.3 cm ( 5 ft 0 in ) . 
  by the end of the 20th century , heights averaged 181.3 cm ( 5 ft 11 in ) for males and 167.5 cm ( 5 ft 6 in ) for females . 
  do n't start with this guy , he 's known hardcore polish nationalist that could n't stand vilnius region being part of lithuania during interwar period . 
  land we always claimed , we had control of it before poles took it over . 
  ussr and weimar republic/nazi germany was on lithuanian side on vilnius dispute .
