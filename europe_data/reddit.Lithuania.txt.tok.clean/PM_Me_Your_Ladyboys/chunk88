  the only reason got bigger stick was because of france was jerking off on seeing poland as strong as possible . 
  why would he ? 
  russian people are the least what we 're worried about , russia 's government though , is next level non sense . 
  you broke the moment , shame on you . 
  i do n't listen to the kinds of you . 
  ussr killed half of estonian jews . 
  til fucking nazis are liberators of the baltics . 
   after first soviet invasion :, 
  that 's why we also have to be prepared for potential guerilla warfare . 
  not surprising then . 
  was it before fall of ussr or right after ? 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) we 're northern european , we do n't get gangbanged , we got locked away in russian dungeon and had to watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7ej_ngqnrk ) all day long . 
  it gave me [ feels ] ( http://x3.cdn02.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_doekqcrceawdca49lnxwxyv5ktb1dt28.jpg ) . 
   the emperor would have surrendered anyway . 
  you do know emperor did n't surrender after first bomb was dropped ? 
  he would rather see his people starve than surrender . 
  you ca n't even call it liberating army , since it re-occupied after driving out former aggressor . 
   the textbook gives a similar explanation for russia 's military presence in the baltic states . 
  according to the authors , russia 's invasion and annexation of the three northern european countries was the result of ** democratic parliamentary elections ** in the countries in ** which the communists in the baltic states won ** . 
  this make me so fucking mad . 
  after first soviet invasion :   on july 14 -- 15 , 1940 , rigged parliamentary elections for the `` people 's parliaments '' were conducted by local communists loyal to the soviet union . 
  ** because of newly installed election restrictions , only the communists and their allies were effectively allowed to run ** . 
  the election results were completely fabricated to give the communists large majorities : the soviet press service released them early , with the result that they had already appeared in print in a london newspaper a full 24 hours before the polls closed . 
   nice , first time i see the russian version of `` we save your asses during wwii '' . 
  we have been hearing this since ... forever . 
  her speech turned me gay , then it got reverse , now im confused what i want . 
  science helps to know which kind of things makes other things rise . 
  because it was boring and waste of my time . 
  now , i do n't really care , if i need to clean up , i do , not when i 'm told . 
  that 's just theory . 
  i hated it as a kid . 
  russia claims everything they can , they had german queen of russia , that must mean germany is rightful russian clay , and belarus , well belarus does n't know such thing as nationalism , they do have some coconuts who thinks vilnius belongs to belarus . 
  it had poles , but it was n't . 
  it still corresponds with second map , knowing that lithuanian language only started to shrink after russification process . 
  czechia is different thing from lithuania , it was greatly influenced by west , lithuania was only christianized ( most of the nobles still kept believing in pagan faith ) and had room to create it 's own rules . 
  for poles of course , since you wanted to subdue us in every possible way , while hre wanted to balance it out and make us less reliable on polish kingdom . 
  [ lithuanian language in 16 century ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png/800px-lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png ) - [ german ethnographic map of 1847 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ba/5b/a6/ba5ba6abb3b1cda953e0b97390042284.jpg ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvia\u2013lithuania_border  the international border was restored at independence in 1991 . 
  after prolonged negotiations , in july 1999 , the border between territorial waters was drawn as a straight line between 56 \u00b0 04 \u2032 08.9 \u2033 n 21 \u00b0 03 \u2032 51.47 \u2033 e and 56 \u00b0 02 \u2032 43.5 \u2033 n 20 \u00b0 42 \u2032 35.0 \u2033 e. 
  vilnius , doubtful , poles claimed it because it was majority polish speaking , lithuanians claimed it because it used to be lithuanian speaking that always belonged to kingdom/grand duchy of lithuania . 
  still got ptsd from last time . 
  wait , they stole your crown ? 
  we had personal union with poland and they also took/delayed crowns deployment , that 's why lithuania officially always were referred as grand duchy ' instead of kingdom ' even though almost every grand duke before union of lublin referred to himself as king of lithuania . 
  * `` we are the balts . 
  lower your borders and surrender your cities . 
  we will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own . 
  your culture will adapt to service us . 
  resistance is futile . 
  they would n't fit , not even russia can out drink finland . 
  then again , it was n't germans fighting russians , when only half of ussr 's casualties were russians . 
  even then , it was n't 1v1 , you 're trying way to hard to prove thin air . 
   reeeeaaally slooooowly you got your answer why , due to estonians having few extra latter in their language it looks like you 're intentionally trying to speak slowly . 
  by ussr 's constitution , essr exists , which was destroyed after occupational force was driven out and independent republic of estonia was once again free and restored . 
  i think ours is not about land either , that 's why is super insignificant . 
  i know . 
  what are you trying to prove ? 
  that still does n't prove anything . 
  my point stands , it was n't 1v1 . 
  same with radical polish nationalist in interwar period , occupying belarusian and ukrainian speaking lands , but they did n't seem to care even slightest . 
  i do n't really know , i never seen a lot of jokes about latvia , though we do have memes about estonians being slow as hell . 
  they did it for a reason - to make sure they never join eu or nato . 
  they did same shit with georgia , they 're stuck in limbo . 
  for poles -  interwar period borders . 
  for lithuanians -  ethnographic borders . 
  for finns -  united finnic states . 
  ukraine and belarus were members because they 're `` co-founders '' of ussr , before that it was soviet russia . 
  besides baltic states were illegally occupied ( since 1940 till 1991 ) with most countries not recognizing de jure control over the states , only de facto e.g. 
  occupation . 
  you do realize latvia and lithuania has a border dispute , but it 's so minor nobody actually cares . 
  well the region used to populated by germans with some mix of poles and lithuanians , now it 's completely russian . 
  other than ethnic demographics nothing changed there . 
  except probably instead of reconstructing old german buildings they started to build bunch of commieblocks . 
  russia -  crimea, 
  according to world we 're [ northern ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_europe ) now . 
  everyone wants to be part of central ~ ~ germ ~ ~ europe !, 
  either way you should n't look at this map from serious scope . 
  ukrainians used to inhabit those lands . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe#/media/file:centraleurope2.png https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg/683px-grossgliederung_europas-en.svg.png, 
  then do n't talk nonsense . 
  still does n't apply to every nationalist . 
  not you , it 's eesti , you 're now colony of eesti . 
  pretty lazy . 
  i consider myself lithuanian nationalist , but in no way i would ever want those lands back , those lands have nothing left of lithuanian in them any more and would be more of a problem than extension to our nation state . 
  total nonsense , we do n't want poles or russians . 
  because ukraine does n't bend over any more , they throw a punch back . 
  russia was only half of ussr casualties , it was n't 1v1 at all . 
  estonians , finns and latvians never had influence though . 
  after xiii c. till ~ 1917 all of them were occupied battlefields . 
  exactly , yet they 're blaming west for their own problems . 
  ukraine has same problem , all post commie states had same problem , the difference some of us actually done something about it . 
  he 's irish , i doubt he could label all the nations that russian empire occupied and how different it was from rufed . 
  borders . 
  not history , just bunch of people who do n't give a fuck about their lives as long as they 're not starving . 
  then again , russia empire occupied far larger part of land than ussr , let alone today 's rufed does . 
   ~ 20 million russians died nope , you 're exaggerating . 
  only ~ 14 million russians died . 
  russians were a bit more than half of ussr 's casualties . 
  there is difference between * what you could be * and * what you actually are * . 
  judge , i 'm not judging , it 's a fact that we do n't need religion in our modern society . 
  religion gives nothing to society other than forcing some fairy tales on adults and their children .
