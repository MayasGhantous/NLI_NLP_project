  [ i assume russian part . 
  ] ( http://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/evans_map-20120712.jpg ) ussr was as much monster to east prussians as nazis were to jews . 
  face , does n't go well with the beard . 
  oh you know , doing my daily training on how to [ march towards poland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/lietuvos_kariuomene_1938.army_of_lithuania_in1938.jpg/500px-lietuvos_kariuomene_1938.army_of_lithuania_in1938.jpg ) , nothing special . 
  it belongs to us . 
  keep your slavic hands from our baltijos broliuko . 
  battle of saule ( sun ) best day of my life . 
  killing people is worst option , but to end imperilism japan had to be nuked twice . 
  now look at it , high tech country with huge economy and great potential and then you look at russia ... you can spot the difference between totally blown country and a one time superpower . 
  i assume he 's from prussia . 
  so what you 're saying it 's up to russia on which alliances poland wants to be part of ? 
  kinda reminds me our early [ interwar borders ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/rzeczpospolita_1920_claims_names.png ) . 
  [ make lithuania , grand duchy again !, 
  this picture disturbs me . 
  my eyes are seeing pure bordergore , damn . 
  yes , yes , yes , i know you hate usa , either way that 's why i 'm in favour of european army , until then i hope nato and usa 's hegemony keeps existing . 
  you really think usa soldiers are the only ones here ? 
   and no , i do n't think he would do that , it would cause a domino effect on usa 's hegemony . 
  germany is on glimpse of it 's potential . 
  if it was on full serious mode for the army , turkey would be just a shadow to germany . 
  more like never trust russia . 
   nato has already been undermined - people are fools to trust in it . 
  top kek, 
  i wish we could help more instead of turning blind eye to the ukrainian people . 
  what he 's trying to say is that ukrainians are nazis , he 's eaten a lot of russian media lately . 
  happy independence day , broliai ir seseris !, 
  remember the dead , fight for the living . 
  as you can see from polish point of view , you won . 
  livonia order was fully absorbed by teutonic order after their famous but shameful defeat against pagan lithuanians in [ battle of saule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_saule ) . 
  except lithuanians , origin of * vokietija * is unknown , otherwise we would be calling you * teutonija * ( tauta - nation in lithuanian ) since teutonic order was our first contact with germans . 
  fun fact , there are two name translations for * teutonic order * - * kry\u017eiuo\u010di\u0173 ordinas * ( cross bearers ) , but more commonly known as * vokie\u010di\u0173 ordinas * . 
  - in lithuanian language and it 's dialects since ancient times were there several names for germans . 
  one of the oldest is * niem\u010diai * ( borrowed from slavs 100 % ) , later * germanai * ( most likely borrowed from latin ) , only then * vokie\u010diai * ( origin unknown ) appeared . 
  german word form * deutch * derived from ancient * teute * , to us ( lithuanians ) known as * teutonai * , in indo-european proto-language ( or lithuanian language ) it means * nation * , * people of the nation * . 
  to note , slavic form for germany - nemcy in xii c was replaced by already used word * variagi * , * varangi * . 
  -  does it translate to something ? 
  the meaning is unknown , only several speculations exist . 
  that 's not all , i 'm sure there are more which i do n't know , modern linguists do n't agree on balto-slavic theory , only scholars do . 
  in lithuanian , * germany * is called * vokietija * , nobody knows the story how it came to be . 
  i 'm not gay , i just have fetish . 
  because our language does n't consist bunch of loanwords . 
  some parts of europe *, 
  because vocabulary does n't not determine how close are branches . 
  besides this thing is disputed and from lithuanian point of view , we do n't call ourselves balto-slavs . 
  what else you gon na tell me what i already knew ? 
  ; o  vocabulary in this case english is romance language and not germanic . 
  tell that to englishmen , he was screaming in my face that we 're slavs . 
  that 's blood . 
  did n't say you were , but were was a threat of it were n't ? 
  long time ago . 
  only those who were born in 80 's can speak russian . 
  so still a huge chuck of population , but english took younger folk completely . 
  baltic-slavic branch is disputed in two camps . 
  due to lack of written ancient baltic languages it is not clear if this branch actually existed and even so if it did such branches like celtic-italian should be also included . 
  he 's not seen as bad guy in lithuania , rather great military person who made terrible political actions . 
  i never called you german , just said you had german influence . 
  but iirc you had troubles with hre . 
  if belarus went for closer ties with the west instead of east , only then we would see warmer relations , until then there is no way belarus and lithuania will ever have great relationship as neighbouring nations . 
  edit : i realized that this article is pretty biased towards belarusians , rather than lithuanians . 
   you 're saying that you want them to learn lithuanian first . 
  would you be fine with learning russian first under the soviet union ? 
  what , they learning lithuanian language as second or even third . 
  nobody is forcing them to learn it as their mother tongue . 
  so what you 're saying we should create our own very donbass ? 
  which soviet union tried to do with polish minority during fall of ussr , thank god polish goverment was n't stupid enough to support that self proclaimed republic . 
  no , nobody is forcing them to not speak polish ... what are you even tring to convince , that lithuanians are genociding poles ? 
   lithuanian languages lithuanian dielact *, 
  yeah , i actually heard that . 
   conventional groupings depends from which place you look on it . 
  yet modern linguistics still considers them to be seperate group . 
  there is n't just one camp on this . 
  them speaking lithuanian language as second/third foreign language ? 
  they will have bigger possibilities in lithuania if they will know lithuanian language , instead of using just polish . 
  except there is no difference between lithuanian poles and romanian hungarians lives , even due to one having regional official language . 
  you 're trying to make trouble out of sky . 
  i live in north central part of lithuania , so my knowledge of poles in vilnius is quite limited , thanks for heads up . 
  not every state is same . 
  polish cultural life is not opressed , let alone their language , there is no need to make laws that would slow down integration . 
  poles are bigger problem when it comes to integration than russians . 
  giving them special rights they do n't really need would only slow down the progress of integration . 
  he 's latvian , tons of german influence . 
   latin is such an ugly language though . 
  for lithuanian like me , not really . 
  of course i 'm trolling on this . 
  depends on school and where you live , if let 's say you live in eastern most parts of lithuania , learning polish would be good for you , the problem is that some poles in some parts of eastern most vilnius region are speaking lithuanian + polish + russian + belarusian mash up , a common pole from poland would n't understand a thing . 
  other than that lithuanian and english are mandatory languages to learn , with second foreign being spanish , french , german , russian . 
  during my gymnasium days i had choice of french , german and russian , i took french , just to quit it several years later . 
  what i 'm saying the similiraties that are found in baltic and slavic languages are only there because since ancient times it contacted with each other more than any other group , some linguists even think that slavic languages were just part of neo-baltic branch model , especially due to them using 3 accentuation , instead of 2 that ancient balts used . 
   what exactly do you want ? 
  for them to live their entire lives not knowing a word in lithuanian , living in their polish ghettos , ignoring the wider lithuanian society ? 
  actually polish minority in lithuania asked for more hours for lithuanian language classes . 
  polish minority is not the problem , valdemaras toma\u0161evskis is , and polish media eats whatever he gives . 
  he wants lithuanians to learn polish again . 
  i guess [ j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski 's soul ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) still lives on in poland . 
  that conventional grouping will bring lots of misunderstanding . 
  like one of redditors said , quote `` when i traveled to lithuanian i thought it 's language will be close to that of polish , boy how i was wrong '' end quote and i agree with lingustics who want to group baltic and slavic branches differently , i just do n't understand anything in slavic , but i find similiarities in that of ancient greek , sankrit or even latin texts , even german is as close as polish is . 
  why should it be ? 
  only 5.6 % speaks it . 
  there are polish schools and usage of polish language is not forbidden ... chill your tits , eat less of your media . 
  i do n't like the balto-slavic grouping ( there are lingustics who disagrees with this ) , our languages have as much in common with slavic languages as it does with sanskrit or latin .
