  most southern part of russia somehow manages to reach same temperature as lithuania , well colour me surprised . 
  and how do you know ? 
  sources on that ? 
  yes , i heard about siberian beaches . 
  you 're representing your own opinion , not your whole nation 's . 
  as time will go on , serbia will become pro western . 
  they always do . 
   weimar republic best germany for us . 
   but why would you even want a political union with us ? 
  russian trojan horse , remember ? 
  that 's what you think , not we . 
  umm , no . 
  but knowing how british people treated irish , i 'm not surprised why they were more than sad to see the only guy that could fuck britain in it 's ass was dead . 
  yeah , so what , people show condolence to stalin and he 's as much mass murderer as hitler is . 
  this is just one man , not whole nation . 
  wow , what a great crime against humanity - showing condolence . 
  what ever floats in your island . 
  you do know ireland was neutral during ww2 ? 
  thankfully it 's not up to you to decide . 
  what ? 
  finnish commie . 
  it all makes sense now . 
  skinheads are filled with potatoes in their heads . 
  brexit makes sense after all . 
  i know your beer sucks , but ours is as much glorious and rich as german/belgian is . 
  no , but he 's closest thing that makes belarus stable and that 's what lithuania wants , a stable belarus . 
  [ hellgate : london ] ( https://youtu.be/oixardpajp0?t=226 ), 
  that 's why european countries should be supportive of european army , to end human trafficking . 
  europeanarmy \u2122, 
   i do n't disagree that the eu and the us would like to get rid of lukashenko except we would not . 
  yes those cia trained lithuanian ninjas helped to create coup in ukraine backed by lithuanian elves to counter russian intelligence . 
  because most of them sit in vilnius . 
  do you even know what is constitutional monarchy ? 
  you know such thing as constitutional monarchy ? 
  monarchs have barely any power if any . 
  let 's throw italian wine culture , it 's trash against society for making people alcoholic . 
  they literally have no power , what 's your problem ? 
   well , they are parts of russia which became independent in 1991 , so they are heirs in that sense , yes . 
  okay ... 
  we do , but ukraine and belarus are as much heirs to kievan rus ' as russia is , people are called * rus\u0117nai * ( ruthenians ) , not * rusai * ( russians ) . 
  then again , catholic church does n't belong in modern world , it 's a past , history . 
  when people look at russia they look at g.p. 
  of muscovites as proto-russians and territories they annexed . 
  you win this round . 
  * sips coco *, 
  yeah , going back then people got burned for `` witchcraft '' , wonderful times . 
  not . 
  any topic that involves nationalist will be filled with hate . 
  [ okay , we can commonwealth now .

  what , the fuck . 
  for you !, 
  gib back throne, 
  sounds like extended word for retardas e.g. 
  retard . 
  given your politicians i would n't say they think rationally . 
  status quo , given they 're greens , can even say favourably . 
  can confirm accurate . 
  applies both to poland and lithuania : * now you 're just somebody that i used to know *, 
  stop stealing culture !!!!!!!!, 
  reeeeeeeee !!, 
  if you 're interested there is podcast on yt about northern crusade . 
  they would be converted and made into serfs . 
   so if you guys won then did you guys retain some of your pagan culture and religion , at least academic knowledge of it if not practice ? 
  famine names like ugn\u0117 ( fire + suffix ) , egl\u0117 ( fir + suffix ) etc. 
  are still retained to this day . 
  i do n't know much about our pagan culture as i was n't really interested in it , but major celebrations like jonin\u0117s ( pretty much involves dancing around bonfire , getting drunk and then trying to find fern flower ) are still present . 
  in literature such stories like * egl\u0117 \u017eal\u010di\u0173 karalien\u0117 * ( egl\u0117 queen of the serpents ) or * j\u016brat\u0117 ir kastytis * ( story about sea goddess j\u016brat\u0117 and sailor/fisher boy kastytis ) . 
   they were n't able to totally wipe out lithuanian paganism like they did so many other pagan religions ? 
  they could n't and hardly even tried to . 
  they had [ half of ethnic lithuania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/teutonic_order_1410.png/1024px-teutonic_order_1410.png ) for a short amount of time , but soon lost it back to us . 
  lithuania was the one that prevented livonia and teutonic orders to completely merge , probably saving both latvian and estonian languages from old prussian fate . 
   did lithuanians keep written records at this time so it survived in written word ? 
  everything that is lithuanian survived through mouth by mouth . 
  lithuania did n't had any written records before creation of kingdom later grand duchy of lithuania , before reign of mindaugas nothing is known much about lithuania , not even parents of our one and only king mindaugas . 
  i do n't know what you define a holy army , but i think the answer is no . 
  though teutonic order was known for their heavy infantry e.g. 
  high number of knights . 
   ah so converting was just a side effect of battle . 
  nope . 
  we won both major battles that destroyed both livonian order with [ battle of saule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_saule ) and teutonic order with [ battle of grunwald ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_grunwald ) . 
   your prisoners and captives would convert or die ? 
  what are you talking about . 
  i 'm lithuania , we were those pagans that fought off crusader invasion successfully . 
   after they won a battle they would destroy pagan ritual and holy sites i 'm sure . 
  of course they would . 
  to step stone on their own domination of that land . 
   so the destruction of pagan religion in the area was n't even a primary goal . 
  they fought to conquer land , not to convert it . 
   are you polish ? 
  ca n't you hover over my flair ... 
  i 'm not even wearing polish flag ... wtf, 
  non stop raiding and border dispute . 
  when lithuania became independent all of africa was still colonies . 
  none of this got any connection other than similar colour pattern . 
  check [ northern crusades ] ( https://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png ) , it was to conquer pagan and eastern orthodox land . 
  even after king mindaugas converted lithuania into christianity , teutonic order did n't stop raiding so soon nobility ditched christianity and went back to paganism , including king , only ~ 100 years later we would christianize again , this time not through livonian order , but by kingdom of poland , because that 's what personal union included - accepting christianity . 
  for teutonic order it was all about land grab , not conversion . 
  for lithuania and polish kingdoms , teutonic order was greatest threat . 
   the goal of swedish warfare during the 17th century was to make the baltic sea an all-swedish sea ( ett svenskt innanhav ) , something that was accomplished except the rout [ clarification needed ] between riga in latvia and szczecin in poland .
