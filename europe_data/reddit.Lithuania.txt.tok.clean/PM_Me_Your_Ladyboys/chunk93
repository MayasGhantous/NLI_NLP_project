  you guys flame on every ~ ~ russia ~ ~ usa related thread . 
  this sub has incredible amount of serbians who always try to defend russia 's crimes . 
  why do people try to brush off one 's crimes because other did more ... 
  this is sick . 
  which is sad , they could have saved at least parts of other half of europe from soviet terror . 
  because russians burned moscow to the ground , leaving grand armee without resources . 
  he crossed lithuania during his march towards moscow , biggest army you ever saw on continent . 
  second time they came again , retreating , barely anything left of them , few french men even hunted down dog that was nearby and ate it . 
  we wanted for napoleon to win , but he did a mistakes thinking that russians will surrender . 
  soviets , which russians made majority killed +65 million people and yet it was brushed off . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato%e2%80%93russia_relations#suggestions_of_russia_joining_nato  ** russian leadership ** , however , made it clear ** russia did not plan to join the alliance ** , preferring to keep cooperation on a lower level now . 
  in march 2009 , the russian envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , in response to rados\u0142aw sikorski \u2032 s proposal , while not ruling out nato membership at some point in the future , was quoted as saying : ** `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power . 
   reunification of ukraine and _ ussia for russian , ukraine is just [ little russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/little_russia#.22little_russianness.22 ) . 
   stop mocking at the great monument what is great in that ? 
  jelly much ? 
  well done , ca n't get any lower . 
  russian empire partitioned our country , started russification , gave governor that would be nick named as `` hangman of vilnius '' , let 's not even begin with soviets ... how the hell we should look at that history in pro-russian side ? 
  nazis had more potential to be considered liberators than soviets . 
   all `` about russia '' threads are full of offended ukrainians , baltics , poles . 
  go to / r/russia and see how many offended russians are there for not kneeling to `` mighty '' russia . 
  learn latvian/estonian language on basic level , plus know bit of those countries history , take exam and you have citizenship , but all they can do is bitch about not having it , while intentionally denying it for themselves . 
  the reason we gave citizenship instantly is because russians are ~ 4,6 % of our total population , smaller than polish minority . 
  something that makes me smile . 
  leave uk , unite with ireland , bam you eu now . 
  because english does n't require as much as native language in classes . 
  agree . 
  [ gr\u016btas park ] ( http://grutoparkas.lt ) is where all soviet type statues are thrown away . 
  is n't it tiny italy ? 
  of course we are . 
  well the official name our `` kingdom '' back then was * grand duchy of lithuania , ruthenia and samogitia * after all , since we were pagans it was no surprise we had to adopt some kind of writing and lingua franca around our own little `` empire '' . 
  if it was n't for teutonic order raiding we probably would have stayed catholics , after livonian order christianized mindaugas and lithuania became kingdom of lithuania . 
  we would have adopted latin script and would just probably start politically motivated domination , maybe even come on top on poles , since jogaila became king of poland and tied lithuania in personal union with it , polish and lithuanian languages would have had same prestige status . 
  stalin can suck devil 's dick . 
  yes , you 're beautiful kurva . 
   also , lithuania best metropoly < 3 o.o ? 
  yeah , no shit . 
  that 's exact depiction of putin 's propaganda - `` nato is there to eat our babies !!!, 
  [ or does it ? 
  hmm . 
  i see . 
  true . 
  i 'm not even mad . 
  i see . 
  til . 
   ... but do some people actually believe that we evolved from apes ? 
  of course no , we 're all over-clocked bacteria !, 
  bro , i guess you took all the tens in biology class . 
  ~ ~ we 're not apes , we share same ancestor with apes though . 
  just like wolf and dog share theirs . ~ ~, 
  all religions suck balls and they all should be banned whiles churches would be preserved as architectural heritage . 
  shitting on fairy tales = / = shitting on them . 
  all of this will disappear as time will keep going on . 
  what do chavs listen ? 
  our definition of chav is forsas , which mostly listens to hard bass only . 
  [ there is , but it 's rather rock . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scngkm06vx4 ) and not a good one . 
  no , we call it * the federation * now and lithuanian name goes first , it 's our time to shine . 
  of course . 
  practically , yes . 
  [ first holywood , then governor then president , then the world !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lecgje7rvpi ), 
  why not all of poland ? 
  damn croatia , i knew you 're into some kinky stuff , but this ... damn . 
  it 's reich time . 
  here , take wilno to wipe those tears down . 
  before ceding you create total border blockade simple as that . 
  but yes , you 're right , appeasing never worked , did not work for lithuania either . 
  some people say portuguese is spanish spoken by a russian . 
  damn we surpassed portugal , greece and turkey . 
  feeling bad for you , but feeling good for myself . 
  yes . 
  just unite with france . 
  france 's sweetness + germany 's efficiency = [ great pleasure ] ( https://i.imgur.com/gc2jae9.png ), 
  i know that , german unification and `` german question '' were in our history books .

  [ we do ... know about a guy ... who was born in austria .

  but austria is germany , look at this map !, 
  europe master race, 
   a lot of people , myself included , think the japanese way to handle this issue is preferable . 
  yes , i 'm one of them . 
  that 's why i hope after uk leaves eu , talks on european army will go further . 
  \u0160\u0161\u0161\u0161 , little kebab , or else you will get [ kurvasized ] ( https://i.imgur.com/kx0tqji.jpg ) again . 
  which is ironic . 
  you do n't need to project , we accept your hegemony with all our hearts < 3, 
  and here my fellow students you see a primitive caveman , do n't touch him , he bites . 
  now let 's see ... 
  we do n't care about russia , we care about people that are being abused by radical brainwashed coconuts . 
  source on this ? 
  younger people are filled with emotions not logic . 
  yes , those farmers , factory workers magically became elite soldiers who can withstand organized army , of course . 
  do n't worry , half of europe knows . 
  repeart what i 'm saying ... * latvian gibberish * never * continuing latvian gibberish * . 
  must be parrot * latvian gibberish * , yes maybe you 're a parrot ? 
  - dammit latvia wth , even hardcore samogitian is easier understand than you !, 
   was n't there some kind of agreement with russia that ukraine would n't join nato or something ? 
  it 's a myth debunked by both russia and nato . 
  nato was created to counter possible ussr 's invasion of european nations , from gobbling one country after another , sadly after it 's fall it shifted heavily towards russia , since it still acts/pretends as former .
