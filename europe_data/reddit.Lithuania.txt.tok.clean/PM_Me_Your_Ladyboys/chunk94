  some of nato european members before joining nato were dictatorships iirc portugal/greece . 
  it 's not the first time nato has a dictatorship . 
  okay here is a bit of history lesson for you again . 
  lithuania was suppose to have [ german king ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruetmrjbkwi ) in newly established [ kingdom of lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_lithuania_ ( 1918 \\ ) ) after ww1 , but germany was losing war which meant it was impossible task , since it would make harder for lithuania to get recognition in international stage , since poland was already talking shit about us being german/soviet puppets and just schizophrenic region of polish nation . 
  so we became republic like most european nation biased as nation state with capital vilnius that due to polish-lithuanian commonwealth ( 1569-1795 ) was heavily polonized . 
  weimar republic and lithuania had great relationship since [ lithuanian-soviet war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) , plus lithuanian minor ( east prussian region where prussian lithuanians ( lietuvininkai ) lived ) helped our language to survive during [ lithuanian press ban ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_press_ban ) , during occupation by russian empire ( 1795-1917 ) . 
  and after ww1 had mutual enemies - poland and france . 
  nazis are the ones that started stirr shit up between two nations since were was dispute with [ memelland/klaip \u0117da ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_german_ultimatum_to_lithuania ) region that was mix of lithuanians and germans pretty much equally . 
  even then hitler wanted [ lithuania to be germany 's ally ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov\u2013ribbentrop_pact#/media/file:ribbentrop-molotov.svg ) , so they suggested a joint attack against poland from north , which would mean we would be third nation that would split poland and start ww2 , our government refused and then germany stopped hoping for lithuania to be on it 's side . 
  during nazi occupation we gone rogue with our ss unit so they had to disperse it . 
  due to lithuanian refusal on collaboration was the reason why nazis did n't like us like they did with latvians who fought reds without a second thought . 
  if you want to learn more about nazi occupation in lithuania i suggest reading this : http://www.lituanus.org/1956/56_3_02drunga.html, 
   yes , those plans were n't reality because germany lost the war and could n't implement them . 
  and ussr 's war crimes against humanity were forgotten , because victor writes history . 
   big takeway to me is that the population of latvians has been shrinking every census since the soviet union collapsed , when previously it had been growing in every post-world war 2 census shown there . 
  wait you spit in my face that we would be germanized under nazi germany , but you 're perfectly okay with russification , talking about double standards , quite pathetic i 'd say . 
  but then again you 're from usa , what would you know about nation state . 
   then why are you doing just that ? 
  or , more accurately , why are you denying that one evil wanted your people extinct and would have seen to that if it had n't lost ? 
  i did n't deny that coconuts in berlin wanted my nation extinct , i said that nazis who controlled these lands had different plans . 
  either way , soviets wanted estonians , latvians , lithuanians , ukrainians , belarusians , moldovans etc. 
  to be russified e.g. 
  artificially sovietized . 
  - if you have boner for ussr/soviets/communism etc. 
  just say that already . 
   could n't tell that was the polandball fourth reich you were talking about , looking at how you were spamming it . 
  i was n't spamming , i unintentionally wrote it twice . 
   yeah , fifteen percent of you would have been spared , at the cost of your language and culture and sense of being a separate people from the germans . 
  that was their `` plan '' not reality so please . 
  and nowhere i 'm even consider nazi winners . 
   at least their endgame had the lithuanian people still existing . 
  because soviet empire crumbled , let 's take example of [ latvians ] ( http://prntscr.com/ex9tyu ) , if ussr did n't fall latvia would already seized to exist by now . 
  so would estonia , while lithuania was more tough on resisting russification as our partisans who fought ussr for 9 years were assassinating everybody who collaborated with soviets during 1945-1954 . 
  even [ commie leader ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antanas_snie\u010dkus ) of lithuania was clashing with stalin . 
  again , nazis are dicks and assholes , soviets are bunch of cunts too . 
  do n't defend one evil just because were was second one . 
  if you ever need some dues vult , call the pope , he will cover ya . 
  seeing lithuania being poland triggers me so hard , well done . 
  [ golden shower ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2chj-cgup9k ) is not my thing . 
  holy shit , [ 4th reich is a meme . 
  ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/880/441/777.png )  why , when the 3rd wanted to exterminate your people ? 
  first of all the plan was mainly used for slavs and jews and we 're neither . 
  lithuanians and latvians are balts , estonians are finnics . 
  second , unlike most of europe we 're genetically not far away of so called `` aryan race '' : [ light eye + hair map . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/goo27w2.png )  lithuanians , like most other baltic/scandinavian cultures , have been known for being people of above average height . 
  at the end of the 19th century , the average height of males was 163.5 cm ( 5 ft 4 in ) and the average height of females was 153.3 cm ( 5 ft 0 in ) . 
  by the end of the 20th century , heights averaged 181.3 cm ( 5 ft 11 in ) for males and 167.5 cm ( 5 ft 6 in ) for females and baltic reichskommissars had different opinion on how baltic people should be treated after the war , that clashed with those in berlin who made those stupid plans . 
  i 'm not saying that nazis were good , but holy hell , soviets were worse than nazis to us - ethnic lithuanians . 
  they invaded ussr right after winter war , when ussr looked weak as hell because it failed to occupy finland . 
  so yeah , underestimated their enemies . 
  i wish our 1918 's politicians were successful in creating baltic ( lithuanian/latvian ) federation , could have been our own little belgium . 
  well for lithuania there is difference between authoritarian ruler and dictator . 
  bring back 4th reich !!, 
  worrying days indeed . 
  rip dreams of european turkey . 
  yes it was , young children were deported to coldest parts of siberia , [ people would self immolate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romas_kalanta ) themselves since they could n't stand soviet regime any more , ffs [ soviets drove tanks over civilians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania \\ ) ) !, 
  i do n't really get your logic , so what that soviets did n't reach nazi level , they were n't any good for humanity , they literally were cancer of the world after nazism . 
   i never forgot katy\u0144 and i despise stalin , but i acknowledge that had the red army been defeated poland would 've been in an even worse situation than what happened when they rolled through the border yet again . 
  that 's why people are talking about rushing to save as much europe as possible , so western and soviet troops would rather meet somewhere at minsk , saving half of europe from both nazi and soviet terror . 
   anyways , i guess it would be better if they just let the nazis do their thing and exterminate the rest of your jews , half the entire baltic population and germanize or enslave the rest . 
  he did not say that . 
  stop making delusional statements . 
   the main topic was that what the soviets did was no better than the nazis . 
  exactly , that 's why we 're talking about soviet crimes , being no better than nazi ones . 
  soviets raped 2 million german women . 
  you 're a pole god dammit , do you forget katyn massacre ? 
   was that against the fins ? 
  after which the german troops torched the finnish land/forest because they feared they would help the soviets ? 
  yes soviets were fighting to occupy whole of finland . 
  no , that happened after continuation war . 
  plus contrary , finns refused help from soviet union to deal with remaining german troops in finland . 
  the main topic was soviet crimes . 
   ** allowing the russians to advance was a humanitarian crisis , the things they did to the native population was n't much better than what had happened to the locals of nazi occupied territory ** . 
  this is true for the baltics , soviets treated us worse than nazis did . 
  nobody says nazis were nice or okay , the point stands that russians wasted bullets on estonian flag , skinned lithuanians in forests etc. 
  i do n't understand why you bring hitler in this , we are talking about soviet war crimes , not hitler 's and nazi war crimes . 
  you 're trying to defend ussr war crimes , are n't you fanboy ? 
  nazism is what lost war for hitler , putting workforce and potentially soldiers into concentration camps . 
  you should have used winter war as an argument on when soviets send their soldiers into blender like some kind of fruit . 
  winter war ? 
  hello . 
  that all happened before operation barbarossa and look at the ratio 's of casualties between small finland and your `` glorious '' ussr . 
  one evil regime will not make other innocent . 
   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  * to berlin as refugees . 
  which state ? 
  i can mail you some snow . 
  think about your children , about them playing in a snow . 
  it 's snowing now . 
  that 's a funny way to be an asshole . 
  except uk was the largest one and most influential . 
  exactly germany , france etc. 
  were great powers , not superpower like british empire was . 
  you 're so uneducated , holy shit . 
  back then before it lost all of it 's colonies it could have been considered superpower , after ww2 they for sure lost that status . 
  it is not . 
  they exist because of evolution . 
   are just laws within our universe and physics of our universe does n't work in black hole , time literally stops once you 're past singularity . 
  believing in fairy tales will not explain things , you use science and research to explain those things , not book written by man several thousands years ago when most of humanity was still stupid enough to believe in whatever you told them to believe in . 
  prussia does n't exist any more .
