  farage is a good orator , so was another person decades ago if i remember correctly . . my point is - a speech might be good , but what about the contents and the message in general ? 
  your analysis is alright , but try not to lump so many entities together , it is not that simple . 
  okay , first of all i think you are bundling everything into us like it is the state of the world . 
  what do you even consider ` the us system ' ? 
  are you talking about neoliberalism , capitalism , us domestic and foreign policy in general ? 
  somehow we jumped from russia and its neighbors to us alone . 
  i am not going to argue with your point of view ( it is off-topic ) , but a lot of economists and data would beg to differ . 
  also ,  its leaders see militarism as the only course for their advancement at this point . 
  us foreign policy is not the only path to development , it is to secure the current conditions of development and keep it going . 
  oh , yes , it is definitely a fact . 
  does n't mean we have to just take it as a fact and leave it . 
  smaller states act and position themselves to counter the threats of the bigger states . 
  georgia and ukraine attempted that and everyone should be okay with what followed , because it is a fact that those states were and should remain in the hegemony of russia ? 
  i do n't find this reasonable and acceptable nor does most eu and nato member states , especially the ones who experienced russian hegemony in the past . 
  to answer your question , i do n't think ukraine is better off now and it will be years before it stabilizes and develops in a sufficient manner . 
  however , ukraine has potential . 
  instead of having stale economy , self-interest based political elite and a bunch of social issues , it can finally move forward and become something more than another post-soviet russian province . 
  of course a lot depends on the ukrainian people themselves and the willingness of the western policy-makers to commit . 
  i really hope it will move forward and outward , rather than inwards . 
  the meddling by russia does not help this at all , obviously it is not in their interest ( as you said it , it is a geopolitical fact ) . 
  it is in the interest of the ukrainian people though and that is the important part . 
   russia has been laid waste by neighbors in recent memory and russia has laid waste to its neighbors at the same time . 
  baltic states have been occupied twice from the east and once from the west during ww2 ( before you start your argument how war justifies everything , do n't , it does n't ) . 
  also , russia 's neighbors have more right to be threatened . 
  as you said it yourself ,  bordering neighbors are going to be affected , like it or not . 
  we do n't like it . 
  now , about your whataboutism . 
  the use of us and eu soft-power does not compare to the use of russia 's hard-power . 
  because you know , one of them escalates the situation to the incredible highs and leaves a trail of dead bodies . 
  also , your examples are 50 + years old , ask yourself , does this example really apply to the contemporary world and the situation we have now ? 
  it is not really anyone 's fault that russia no longer has the same soft-power capabilities as it did during its soviet era . 
  there is not much that russia can offer to attract friends apart from its resources . 
  it has to rely on hard-power to keep its allies close . 
  is it for the better of the whole of humanity or not , you decide . 
  i 've seen this perception before and i understand how it falls into place quite nicely . 
  of course it does , because it is a constructed narrative . 
  the problem is that you make assumptions that lack evidence and often require more effort than an alternative to explain . 
  i am talking about this  the characteristic well-funded proxy war special interest groups and armed mobs began popping up all over ukraine peddling pro-eu/nato propaganda and  american hegemony to be secured in the long run , all of the lands formerly behind the iron curtain must come under western control . 
  this is not that far from the truth , however , the truth is being bent ( the construction of the narrative ) . 
  the alternative explanation is that many post-soviet states have to align themselves appropriately to meet the needs of the security and citizens . 
  you assume that the events in georgia in ukraine were driven by some aggressive meddling by external agents ( us , eu , cia , whatever ) . 
  i say it again , the assumption has ** some ** truth to it , but aggressive external meddling is not the primary reason why those states chose the path they did . 
  now , the alternative perception that i think is more likely and has more evidence to support it . 
  ( rather than media speculation and interpretation , fear-mongering and the appearance of western elites as evidence for ) . 
  ** here is the alternative - people want change ** . 
  that 's it , this is the primary driving force of nato and eu eastern expansion . 
  the baltic states joined willingly without much domestic opposition and so did many other states ( before you begin thinking about it , hold your argument that some states did not have referendums or whatever , democratically elected representatives decided for them and no civil conflict happened because the majority of the public was happy with the direction they are going to ) . 
  now , let 's talk about georgia and ukraine . 
  5 and 10 years before the conflicts in each state respectively , the people were already seeking change and further break from the post-soviet bloc . 
  i am talking about the failed rose and orange revolutions . 
  people were already fed up with the regimes and the standard of living . 
  eu and nato provided a good security and economic alternative to the ancien r\u00e9gime of post-soviet politics of corruption , oligarchy , stale economy and russia-dominated foreign policy . 
  in international politics , disillusioned people are the primary driving force of political change . 
  most civil conflicts happen this way and it also applies in the case of ukraine and georgia . 
  in other words , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmclvtn2aoc ) is what primarily drove ( see what i did there :d ) the change and further developments in both states . 
  i do not deny the involvement of westerners and western agencies , however , they are not competent or efficient enough to cause such wide disillusionment alone . 
  it is the people . 
  sadly , a vast minority in ukraine decided they do n't want change compared to their counterparts in the central and western ukraine . 
  eu and nato provide a very delicious carrot on a stick , but they are not to blame for these developments . 
  i am purposely not going to answer the questions you have asked , because they dwell in the ` what if ' scenarios . 
  it is unproductive and provide no new knowledge . 
  they serve to ` question more ' and provide an ` alternative perception ' if you catch my drift . 
  i do n't know how another state might act , because there is not enough case studies and there is simply too many nuances to compare . 
  what i do know or believe , is that russia has no right and is morally wrong to infringe upon the decision of the people of a sovereign state . 
  most people here are against russian foreign and certain domestic policies , in addition to the people who get putin-hard-ons for ideological reasons . 
  i believe most people here are mature enough to understand this and not blame the casual vova . 
  well , that 's one thing i can agree with . 
  it is known . 
  i have yet to see a lithuanian nazi apologist in this thread . 
  feel free to point this out . 
  people are aware of the holocaust and there is plenty of rememberence sites , events and education to address this horrible page of history . 
  the people in this thread argue with you because you are the one attempting to justify an act against the humanity . 
  you just said it yourself . 
  you can hardly compare this . 
  both are unjustifiable and should be remembered as inhumane acts . 
  however , you still try to spin this your way to justify the deportations ( ` cuz they ai n't as bad man ! ' ), 
  and prove something that serves no purpose , apart from creating further divide between the baltic states and the current generation of people nostalgic for the soviet past . 
  everyone wants to move on with this , especially the new generation that never had close experience with jews , soviets and the nazies . 
  very few people deny or try to justify the involvement altogether . 
  those are neonazies . 
  you have them everywhere unfortunatly . 
  nowadays , the general public of the baltic states are more concerned that a close neighbour can not approach and address its history in a similar manner . 
  how about the fact that the soviets occupied the baltic states first and a year later it was nazi germany ? 
  nazi propaganda attempted to connect jews to the first soviet occupation . 
  i am not that surprised that some people collaborated with the germans after they drove the soviets back . 
  in other words , soviet and nazi actions were the driving force behind this stupidity . 
  it did n't happen just because . . ( ` nationalists turned out to be genociders ' ) . context is quite important here , do n't you think ? 
  there is one in vilnius . 
  musuem of genocide victims . 
  i think you are forgetting the fact that it was done under the nazi occupation . 
  both regimes are awful and deserve no respect . 
  baltic states and eastern europe just happened to be caught in the middle of the shitstorm . 
  it is a sad time of history that should never be forgotten or justified , especially by ` what if ' scenarios . 
  some people in / r/russia justify these deportations because they helped the war effort against the nazies . 
  ( what if soviet union never won scenario ) . 
  because nuclear waste storage facility equals a nuclear power plant . . did the project even went through ? 
  you are forgetting that ` enroachment ' by the eu and nato is not a valid argument to justify russia 's actions in georgia and ukraine . 
  these states should be free to select their allegiences , friends and rivals . 
  the problem is that the perceptions on this sovereignty diverge . 
  russian elites obviously feel threatened , but is nato an agressive entity set to destroy russia or are russian elites simply afraid of loss of power and investments as it happened with colour revolutions and pro-west pivot in other post-soviet states ?
