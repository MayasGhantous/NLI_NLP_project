  allow me to blunt here : u wot mate ? 
  mussolini , hitler are popular in italy and germany ? 
  1st one looks interesting . 
  tho spiral stairs in 2nd one gave me cancer ... 
  sharing one dish ? 
  sounds like communist idea for dinner , comrade . 
  mm yep , i bet he thought he could keep on rollin rollin rollin with this behaviour ... 
  you are confusing [ cossaks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cossacks ) with [ kazakhs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kazakhs ), 
  ok , now i have an image in my head that will never leave me ... 
  slowdown of population growth is nothing magical . 
  ussr was undergoing urbanization which is likely limit how many children families are having , industrialization leading to both families having to rely less on having as many children as possible to ensure family 's prosperity ( think more work force in a family ) and possibly reduced fertility rates in heavily industrialised cities ( and in ussr there were plenty of those since a lot of cities were build to support factories ) . 
  add on top of that that a lot of populations which usually had high rates of reproductions were targets of killings ( most of them by organising intentional famines ) . 
  so i do not see such slowdowns or rapid increases in population as unthinkable . 
  in 1926 ussr population was ~ 148.7 million so closer to 150 million . 
  you do realise how much land ussr captured between 1926 and 1951 ? 
  you do realise those 62 million is not just people in ussr , right ? 
   assume stalin killed 60 mill , ww2 another 24 . 
  i did write that 62 was a total and up to 50 mill are attributed to stalin , there 's no breakdown on which part of it was in ww2 battles or repressions by stalin outside of war in what i said . 
  so you 're just making up numbers here . 
  but lets just assume that at least 50 of those 62 million were killed internally in ussr so from 150 mil in 1926 it goes to 180 in 1952 with 50 mil casualties totaling a growth rate of ~ 80 mil in ~ 25 years . 
  later from 1952 with 180 mill population grows to 260 mil in 1977 with a growth rate of ~ 80 mil in ... ~ 25 years . 
  so growth rate is not as impressive as you are trying it to make it look . 
  edit : formatting, 
  documents i was referring to were those of ussr , needless to say they had reasons to make statistics look `` less grim '' . 
  overall ussr used to cower up these thing quite heavily , like in video i linked , mass starvation of millions of kazaks was , even at its worst , reported as `` economic troubles '' in newspapers if reported at all . 
  well its a trend actually : see [ here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11506970/proportion-of-russians-who-respect-stalin-is-growing-poll-suggests.html ) , [ here ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7802485.stm ) and [ here ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/01/joseph-stalin-more-popular-in-russia-now_n_2791776.html ), 
  could use a source for that , since most figures i find are between 40 and 62 million ( there are some claiming 20 million in official documents but those are usually criticised for being far too low ) killed by ussr with 34-49 million of those directly attributed to stalin . 
  nothing new really , afaik russian people are quite consistent on who the best leaders they ever had are , no surprises here - the tougher and more bloodthirsty leader is - the higher they rate him . 
  stalin to that point killed tens of millions of russians let alone everyone else . 
  [ also , if you understand russian here 's an example of what happened to kazaks under stalin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjj1gqpska4 ) edit : spelling, 
  not really since in this case russia was the only supplies of gas to lithuania , hence they could set any price they want ( which they did ) , hence this oil price related drop would n't have affected gas price for lithuania in any positive way , so alternative was still needed . 
  this is actually extremely accurate , everytime i have this conversation about it people always list same thing : we hate jogaila , we see union as black day for lithuania etc. 
  funny thing is that i recall all these statements from history books , about lithuanians during occupation of vilnius , all those points were true like ~ 80 years ago and that 's where all these arguments are coming from , so yes people with those arguments are actually living in the past . 
  actually lng gas is n't really cheaper , we still buy most from russia , but the thing is when we had no alternatives russia was gouging insane amount of money , just by having alternative we got russian gas price to drop ~ 23 % , this alone paid for most of the project . 
  we never really wanted `` pure capitalist '' gas we just wanted to have reasonable market prices for it . 
  and now we have it . 
  read what you quoted . . here ill help you to rewrite this sentence :  enabling a situation that makes terrorism likely makes people culpable in my mind too . 
  to  in my mind people who are enabling a situation that makes terrorism likely are culpable too . 
  heres one with [ 33 % in 2011 and 23 % in 2013 , see page 17 ] ( http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2013%20october%207%20survey%20of%20crimean%20public%20opinion,%20may%2016-30,%202013.pdf ) some other results [ here ] ( http://windowoneurasia2.blogspot.lt/2014/03/window-on-eurasia-putin-falsified.html ) and [ here ] ( http://guardianlv.com/2014/03/crimea-referendum-34-percent-not-97-percent-says-former-russian-government-adviser/ ), 
  owning something because you stole it does not impress me , so i do n't see a reason to validate russia here , same goes with idea to referendum , you could have those referendum before takeover and sham referendums , but that would n't have worked in the 1st place hence russian actions . 
  afaik before `` green men '' showed up support for joining russia in crimea was around 41 % , afterwards it was over 90 % ( 93 or 97 ) , that 's nonsense . 
  well one thing we can do is not make statements like this :  georgia should solve this problem by giving ossetia and abkhazia up . 
  since general sentiment of it does not help issue in ukraine one bit . 
  other thing thing we can do is keeping the pressure up so there are no concessions on ukraine situation for russia due to `` war against terrorism '' . 
  which is what we see playing out here . 
  what ukraine could do , tho unlikely , is to push with reform to eliminate main issues that eu has with supporting the country , this mostly involves corruption , oligarchy whatanot . 
  from what i see current ukraine govt wants to keep status quo on corruption and still get full support of eu , and this is unlikely to happen . 
  its not much , but better than nothing . 
   now with ukraine bombing electrical pylons ukrainian govt or nationalists ? 
   ukraine should offer a referendum that would be under ocde surveillance regarding independence of the rebel regions . 
  yes right after france offers the same to isil supporters . 
   in the end , russia is more stable than ukraine so they can hold on after sanctions better . 
  remind me again who 's fault it is that ukraine is so unstable , or are you gon na claim that that russia did n't have anything to do with either crimea or easter ukraine ? 
   we can therefore argue , what next ? 
  how about russia stops supporting separatist in eastern ukraine and take a step back on crimea and go to negotiations ( even if we suppose that crimean referendum was legit , russian actions in accepting its result and going with that is not ) about what kind of status crimea should have in ukraine . 
  i was refering to initial results of [ sevastopol voting results ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidadesnik/2014/03/18/how-russia-rigged-crimean-referendum/ ) , tho point it the whole sham of the referendum that it was , [ since it did not offer status quo vote ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/17/crimea-referendum-sham-display-democracy-ukraine ) , green men involvment , just basic illegality of russian federation actions . 
  ... it 's a mirror statement of what you said ... and what kind of referendum would you like ? 
  one with `` green men '' overseeing the vote and 126 % of population in area voting ? 
   georgia should solve this problem by giving ossetia and abkhazia up . 
  france should solve this problem by giving < insert any french area with high number of radicalized muslims or large amount of wahabist mosques  up . 
  and no recent event in france do n't really point to them being interested in syria only . 
  using your own logic should n't france give up some territory to isil supporters that are french citizens , since they obviously not interested in whole `` united france '' thing ? 
  just sayin . . 
  still better than what some countries do with say . . confiscated cheese . 
   crimea is not ukraine 's territory anymore and they might as well get used to that feeling . 
  what a horseshit statement . 
  what 's next ? 
  `` narva is not estonia 's territory anymore and they might as well get used to that feeling . '', 
  tell how far are you willing to take it ? 
  `` odense is not denmark 's territory anymore and they might as well get used to that feeling . '' ? 
  or was this too far for you and you 'd like to walk it back ? 
  tbh this whole thing about polish letters and sings is all nonsense , it would n't be much of an issue making it work if there was anyone seriously trying to do just that , instead lithuanian poles are represented by [ these people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_action_of_poles_in_lithuania ) and at least in the past polish politicians always stood with them , you will need an additional sun to have enough light for searching any sane politician that would support them . 
  if i recall correctly there was actually a law proposed to have an extra page in passport for spelling persons name in any language they like to some this passport letter issue not just for polish names but any other nationalities as well and it got shot down by llra . 
  trick here is simple : make big fuss about about letters , sign , schools -  get votes -  push for religion in schools , increased power for regions ( read `` we want to have a donetsk respublic of our own '' ) and euroscepticism ( read `` crimea takeover was totally legit and it 's all west fault '' ) -  repeat . 
  needless to say most of lithuanian politicians are dead set against anything this party and their leader proposes . 
  i do n't think there would be issues with polish signs if the idea was n't pushed by party that is dominant in region in question and if they were n't openly advocating for a quasi-federalization of said area while saying that lithuanians should be learning polish in vilnius . 
  overall you 're right , there 's nothing wrong with having double lang street signs in areas with lots of minorities , but context matters and more often than not i feel that it is completely ignored in this argument . 
  true . 
  well it depends , i imagine lithuania would n't mind having what used to be lithuania minor which is more rural area of kaliningrad in the east . 
  and i would have gotten away with it too if it were n't for you meddling sweedes !, 
  my personal view is that apology  money . 
  that said russia could brush off whole money thing and just offer apology + returning all the looted property that was stolen from baltics by ussr , things like valuable documents from universities , medals , historical documents ( like statutes of lithuania for example ) and artifacts etc. 
  i think whole paying back thing should n't be about money but about getting an apology and those historical valuables , not asking any money , were free we can make our own , just return what is rightfully ours . 
  i think making that kind of request would get us much further that whole money thing , it far too easy for russian politicians to point a finger at us and go `` look at them , those greedy pigs just want our money '' on the other hand it 's much harder for putin to explain why russia is holding onto things like estonia 's presidents medal and statutes of lithuania . 
  also use this chance to retroactively rename grand duchy of lithuania to big ` ol hood of lil ` vania, 
  this can be interpreted as a cry for ice-cream in lithuanian ( ledai - ice-cream , a\u0161 noriu led\u0173 !, 
  - i wa n't ice-cream ! ), 
  unfortunately it kinda does . 
  polish politicians at least up until whole ukraine thing were very openly supporting tomaszewki and standing behind his shenenigans . 
  few years ago there were disputes about new education laws and polish representatives were coming over to discuss that to make sure that few issues that minorities had with the law were addressed . 
  week or so before that tomaszewki went on a rant about how lithuania is oppressing everyone and he will not agree to anything , and basically said that it 's lithuanians who should integrate in vilnius . 
  needless to say afterwards anything that polish representatives had to say was more or less ignored , agreeing to anything they had to say after that was political suicide . 
  and that too was a blow to relations . 
  granted polish-lithuanian relations are n't that bad atm but it could be better , for example issue with foreign names in passport already had solution proposed that was shot down by this same guy , so this issue is still around . 
  ow business as usual i guess . 
  :( if not worse : /, 
  i wonder how it will affect relations with lithuania , one thing that always stops any progress here is usually unwavering support of toma\u0161evski by polish politicians . 
  if they are as anti-russian as you claim my hope is that they would try and back someone else other than that guy and his party ( although that 's unlikely seeing as there are not much alternatives on this front ) or just not support him and instead try to work with govt directly to resolve issues . 
  it is somewhat promising that there was some turn away from toma\u0161evski with whole ukraine thing going on , but i 'm worried polish politicians once again will take easy route of supporting him since his party basically has polish minority votes on lock down .
