  i do n't know where is this `` whatabout . . '' nonsense is coming from , in lithuania both soviets and nazis are considered a plague upon humanity , yet here it is - yet another person alluding to idea that lithuanians think nazis were all rainbows and flowers ... 
  in history classes in lithuania wwii is often described as such : `` between hammer and anvil '' ( i believe that 's an actual title of introductory chapter for wwii ) . 
  seriously where the hell are pulling this ? 
  both stalin and hitler are considered to be monsters but i constantly see people like you going around internet diarrhea vomiting this bullshit . . where did you get it from ? 
  did you go to history classes in lithuania ? 
  obviously not . 
  did you bother to pick up lithuanian history book to see how we view wwii ? 
  again : obviously not . 
  so tell me : where are these ideas coming from ? 
  you do n't need to be so gung-ho about disagreeing with me , you can just ask for sources , you know ? 
  [ heres a link on that story ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/world/europe/police-sweep-through-moscow-market-after-violence.html ) . 
  tl ; dr ; for that article : azerbaijani man kills a russian guy ( [ more here ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/world/europe/immigrant-held-in-russia-killing-that-led-to-unrest.html ) ) - hate mob attacks veggie market in the area , mostly run by illegal immigrants , in `` retaliation '' . 
  police sweeps in and starts arresting . . mostly immigrants , because issue is not that hate mob is attacking them , no no , issue is that people being attacked are illegals . 
  one rioter got fined . 
  article also include few interesting quotes from bystanders that also help illustrating how common folk react to it . 
  edit : [ a bit older article about this trend ] ( https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/moscows-immgrants-face-rash-of-skinhead-violence/ ), 
  erm , no hes not very far , he always shoves this whole russian exceptionalism shtick . 
  i do n't think nationalismis is bad per say , but taken to extreme levels it 's unhealthy , and i think when you start talking about special russian `` spirituality '' / dna/righteousness/etc it 's probably too much . 
  also , if taking crimea on the basis of `` it was always russian so f ` off '' is not aggressive nationalism , then i do n't know what is . 
  how about his repeated statements about `` protecting russian people abroad '' when justifying crimea and claiming the right to intervene wherever ? 
  i 'd agree that racism is not really something that hes open about , but he does routinely underscores whole `` we 're very special - we 're russian '' and then when mob of russian racist go on the streets of moscow to `` hunt '' for immigrants he looks the other way , and when the dust settles police comes and arrests . . immigrants . 
  kinda sends a message , do n't you think ? 
  well , 555 anniversary is n't too far away either , we can call it 5/5/5 anniversary, 
  i think there should be a limit to how many years can be rolled over , otherwise it would lead to people hoarding beatings leading to reduced number of injuries that will result in less work for doctors and they are already in though situation with economy doing so poorly . 
  exactly what i had in mind , 
  or italy 's badge could have a silly hat that would act as it 's own link, 
  what basic facts ? 
  either make your point or stop pretending of having one to begin with . 
  awww yeaa !, 
  true enough , just using seimas as an oversimplification for `` those in power that get to make decisions '', 
  and what 's worse - it 's our pricks in seimas that are lagging behind ... 
  yes , my father had to serve in afghanistan , he does n't talk about it much , but sometimes after few beers he does mention some horrible shit , clearly not the best memories , adding to that after returning he was also being coerced into joining some special agency ( nkvd ? ), 
  that was basically snitch central . 
  after he refused they tried to send him to serve in kaliningrad but he ran away from it by bribing doctor with vodka to say that hes unfit . 
  so basically you 're minotaurs while we 're centaurs ? 
  we have nice wi-fi tho , think about it !, 
  yes , but as price increase was n't uniform , people just point out prices that did increase and ignore everything else , also when it comes to local markets over last 2 years it looks almost like a 1 to 1 conversion , what was once 1 litas is often now 1 euro , so while statistics look good ( note that super markets in lithuania were quite strictly pressed to keep their prices and there was and still is lot of control over that ) on the ground actual situation is a bit different , hence negativity . 
  another thing that plays into it is rampant media campaign before adoption declaring that prices wont rise at all and people who think that are alarmist . 
  as you said prices not rising for a long time would be strange , but when they rose ( either because of adoption of euro or just other market forces ) government kept insisting that it 's all in peoples heads . 
  this naturally caused anger and dissatisfaction . 
  so that likely plays into this somewhat negative attitude . 
  mm dno about that , maybe it was a worry for economists , but people were most worried about price increases and that was proven to be very well founded fear , in lithuania at least . 
  protection from sun , skin cancer is a mthrfckr . 
  the plot thickens : belarus pretends to be lithuania , proceeds stealing and cheating . 
  we get the blame , poland is angry - no commonwealth -  ??? 
  turtle jumped him while he was having a sandwich it was a brutal struggle for salad leafs . 
  how about we return all the stuff we stolen and cheated out of poland then ? 
  leavetuania, 
  iv ' e been routinely checking the ones in vilnius old town , so far i have n't seen any aluminium tubes that could be converted in to rockets later on . 
  so we 're safe , for now . 
  i 'll keep and eye out for any strange movements in the kitchen . 
  baltic forest brothers , obviously !, 
   we called them mccarthyists many decades ago read up on what mccarthyim actually is . 
  it was used to attack democrats to weaken their grip on power by publicly decrying everyone perceived being political enemy as commie based on * anything * regardless of any actual merit to it . 
  russia on other hand was actually strong arming counties into the fold , hence baltics did what they had to in order to shield themselves from it . 
  again - your analogy is broken and incorrect . 
   you admit yourself they can not even dominate countries on their own border . 
  well russia ca n't dominate baltics because they are in nato , so yeah were in agreement here . 
   anyway , regardless of russia , nato decides who to admit . 
  nato decides to expand . 
  if the border between russia and nato is moving east , its because nato wants it that way nope , nato can not expand into baltics if baltics do n't want that . 
  so if baltics were n't pressured by russia they would n't have ever applied in the 1st place . 
   border between russia and nato is moving east well then russia is free to stop their little game of `` rebuilding the empire '' right now and problem is solved . 
   picture the eu continuing to fall apart and russia snapping up the pieces . 
  baltics do not belong to russia so nato accepting them is not `` snapping up '' russia , so you analogy is broken and incorrect . 
   conflict with south-ossetia and abkhazia are frozen yep - except for when borders start slowly creeping forward ... 
  guys , what are you ... uh never mind , i 'll just walk along . 
  do n't care about the wine , but the rest of it is making me hungry . 
  badly !, 
  uhg ... title is misleading to say the least . 
  but it seems to be a trend : find survey relating to someone not liking/associating with someone else - call it survey on racism . 
  rinse repeat . 
  guess they are not going to * cling on * this name for long then . 
  i 'll beam myself out , [ scotty ] ( https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/memoryalpha/images/e/e3/montgomery_scott_enjoying_a_glass_of_scotch.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20061222001007&amp;path-prefix=en ) . 
   russia ~ ~ appears to be ~ ~ is taking georgia 's land inch by inch, 
  ye , status quo is a safe bet i guess . 
  well in this context changing refers to them rewriting the history , so yeah i 'd like them to change and stop changing their interpretation of history because it is usually the sign of `` changes '' you were referring to . 
   you leave out the part about poland emerging from ww2 as a soviet ruled puppet state [ no , do n't touch that !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffaag5uoci ) [ ugh , let 's try something else ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycryvhbmgly ), 
  no no , please do . 
  russia seems to be on one of it 's famous history rewriting binges lately . 
  edit : old joke - future of russia is clear and always the same , it 's past that keeps on changing . 
   i do n't like russia as much as the next guy , but this is not good . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd make such a blind judgement of good/not good , their country is torn apart by russians ( not kremlin - those soldiers did not walk out of kremlin to ukraine , they are russians , not some kremlinians from planet kremlin ) , what do you expect ? 
  everyone going about their jolly good day ? 
  there will be a reaction - it can be this it can be worse and there can be horrible . 
  do n't get me wrong i do n't like this either , but sitting under nato umbrella i do n't really get to judge their situation in any objective manner , and neither do you . 
  i think there 's a huge disconnect in understanding between us and country that is at war . 
  i have no allies here - time to turn to pancake terrorism !, 
  you 'll be found in a dark alley with potato pancake in your mouth incoherently mumbling about sour cream !, 
  edit : matching flair !, 
  heretics !, 
  / u/labasaskrabas both of you !, 
  out !, 
  color me surprised , i agree with macron on something . 
  nigeria is a great example of country that has resources but is being hammered by out of control birth rate for last half century .
