  lot 's of fucking over there ... 
  there should have been yatviag castles but they were wooden . 
  ruthenians possibly had castles too later though yeah it was not worth it i guess . 
  maybe in the northern part along the prussia ... 
  at least i think so . 
  there any castles left in podlasie ? 
  remember that it was ruled by grand duchy until 1569 . 
  really like malbork . 
  it looks similar to trakai castle . 
  [ trakai island castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trakai_island_castle ) [ kaunas castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaunas_castle ) [ medininkai castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medininkai_castle ) [ panemune castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panemun\u0117_castle ) [ raudones castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raudon\u0117_castle ) there are more but many of them survived only in parts and wooden ones that we had many did n't survive of course . 
  we only have castle hills left . 
  and rest of grand duchy of lithuania castles are in poland , belarus , ukraine ... 
  smart guy huh ... 
  then they are idiots ... 
  get your broomsticks out of your ass ... 
  i would agree on aphrodite though hera/athena could be debatable ... 
   tri-colour filthy peasant ... 
  you are different for us too . 
  shit list ... 
  i just wondered which goddess fits each country more . 
  so which goddess is which country ? 
  fine . 
  then we like germany more . 
  well . 
  have n't visited the other two . 
  [ we really like our old flag that is coat of arms now . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuania#mediaviewer/file:coat_of_arms_of_lithuania.svg ), 
  umm no . 
  yeah it 's really the main problem with baltics ... well also demographics . 
  female ... 
  male or female prostitute ? 
  gaaaaayyy, 
  also appear on nasha rasha ? 
  selling krokodil ... 
  [ this ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_entente ) did not end well though we were neutral + we had poblems with poland ... 
  i more or less agree though we need to pump out money like singapore too . 
   well water was much more healthy well it can cointain chemicals and other substances but if not it 's very healthy and tasty too . 
  though in coutry side now days we ussually have both wells and tap water . 
  we need fusion . 
  we had one but eu told us to shut it off before joining . 
  or you know ... make more bathrooms ... 
  call congressmen ... and maybe secretary of nato while we are at it ... 
  do n't really need warships . 
  fighters would be good but we do n't have the money so we use air police force . 
  tanks i suppose would be good too . 
  instead we only have javelins . 
  pretty much ... 
  do n't know ours ... 
  does n't matter anyways because it 's to hard to compete with those wermarcht/ss marches ... 
  yes . 
  now wonder so many decided to actually escape to ukraine ... 
  and chinese one just says `` fuck it '' and goes to some mountains to kill monks ... 
  and what if some people decide to make `` peoples republic '' get russian soldiers into their borders and say that we are aggressors ? 
  would nato help ? 
  when the balance is threatening my sovereignty ? 
  no thanks ... 
  legacy . 
  same . 
  prepare your anus for a monopoly that we have in lithuania . 
   because the majority of the land seized absolutely was polish ? 
  because of polonization ... 
   so in the end ussr made ww2 possible . 
  agree on this one . 
  if reds did not come to power and russia become democratic germans would had even less chances . 
  maybe but article shows no examples so ca n't really judge it . 
  i only can speak for lithuania . 
  and in here we always struggled to be accepted as part of western civilization but we also do n't denaunce our unique history . 
  not in eastern europe . 
  yes . 
  well we have mandotory english and then russian or german ( sometimes french ) . 
  but you can later drop them off so most people choose not to study them . 
  i suppose yes because old people for example can communicate a bit . 
   fox news fuck em ' too . 
  those pricks ... 
   where 's your navy poland ? 
  huh ? 
  why the hell would they need a big navy in baltic sea ? 
  they were trying to get independence . 
  while ukip is just being crybaby that does not find other way to achieve it 's goals . 
   religion is fucked up does it matter to you ? 
  most of customs are from pagan times anyways same as in latvia probably . 
  we do n't understand each others languages ( even with lithuanian/latvian ) , our history is not that common as most people think , since we went different routes , different religion , estonia is finnic , lithuania got influenced by poland , while latvia/estonia by germans and russians . 
  pick us up ant plop us around britain/ireland in atlantic . 
  umm better do n't get captured . 
  younger people in lithuania do n't understand russian almost at all . 
  as long as you have people you can get new ideas . 
  nobody says you ca n't have opinion just do n't disrupt decisions on other matters . 
   if only the baltics had been under such imperialism in the last century ( the setting up of a democracy and withdrawing part . ), 
  replace democracy with communism . 
  have there been no talks for referendum ? 
  that be said i do n't think that you guys would win . 
  you do have ability to leave . 
  you need to vote on it . 
  it does . 
  in fact it counts subconsciously to this day . 
  for example in ukraine . 
  we all are united compared to western europe . 
  yeah . 
  we all know how it ended .
