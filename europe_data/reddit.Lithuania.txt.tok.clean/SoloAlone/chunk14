  http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-germanys-air-force-dying-14549 it talks about german issues with having operational aircraft . 
   take the eurofighter typhoon . 
  the twin-engine , canard-delta wing fighter is germany 's most modern warplane , of which it owns 109 in three different variants . 
  seventy-four were available but only 42 were deployable in 2014 / ... /  but it 's worse than that -- and even these numbers are misleading . 
  germany 's ministry of defense does not `` distinguish between ` full ' or ` conditional ' operational capability , '' der spiegel noted last year . 
  when only counting the fully operational typhoons , the number drops . 
  to eight . 
  then you can check wikipedia . 
  the page , which lists german land force equipment in some cases writes , how many vehichles are operational . 
  it 's not the most reliable info , but you can get a view of everything . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_modern_equipment_of_the_german_army#vehicles as you can see , most vehicles have 1/2 , sometimes a bit more or less operational . 
  the pzh2000 artillery system is the most interesting example , in my opinion ( because it is a good system and artillery is very important in warfare ) . 
  i find it interesting , because out of 121 units only 1/3rd is operational . 
  this is a nice article from early 2016 . 
  it was a check up from the german military ombudsman . 
  article says german military is lacking in many areas , as well as lacking in soldiers . 
  http://www.dw.com/en/ombudsman-german-army-is-short-of-almost-everything/a-19005841 ombudsman states :  however , the army is forced to do so with a record low number of soldiers , and outdated and malfunctioning equipment . 
   `` we are short of almost everything , '' said the spd politician . 
  `` the army is at the turning point . 
  it can not take more cuts . '', 
  it is a big step to create an eu army . 
  it is a big step , because a military is an integral part of a countries sovereignty . 
  it is the first and last line of defence , when diplomacy fails . 
  it is also a tool and a deterrent from any possible enemy . 
  militaries are one of the key parts of statehood since the first states started existing . 
  that is why it is a big deal . 
  i find it weird you talk about eu being incapable of projecting force without a common army , but at the same time you say that if we should have an army , it should n't have a lot of financing , because then it would still have power projection ? 
  i do not understand this logic at all . 
  you ca n't project power if you do not have equipment and soldiers and you ca n't have these if you do not spend money on a military . 
  when you compare the stats of us , china , russia etc. 
  you forget on crucial part - china , russia , india etc. 
  all might seem like not such big military spenders , but they have the materials , factories and everything for them to have well equipped militaries with smaller budgets . 
  much more so , when you consider that they do not have to spend so much money on salaries ( nor do they like to spend a lot of money on social benefits for soldiers , because unlike europeans , they do not care about that ) . 
  the soviet union did n't have to spend as much money on it 's military as the us for it to be considered a global superpower . 
  it did n't even have enough money to spend on it as the us . 
  they had conscription and did n't care much for the comfort of soldiers . 
  yet it was still a dangerous and powerful force . 
  do you imagine an european army to also mistreat , not pay or not give any social guarantees to their soldiers ? 
  and as i said before , usa and a potential european military would have to spend a lot of money on their militaries , regardless if there is a big enough threat or not , not only to deter any possible threats that are or be ready when they emerge , but also to invest in higher tier , better technology , that would n't let soldiers die as easily . 
  defence spending is an insurance . 
  nobody starts insuring their house from a fire when it is already burning . 
  you also speak as if international relations never change , as if new threats do n't emerge from time to time and the world will forever be as it is now . 
  not long ago , many people in the west thought russia could be such a threat as to invade georgia , ukraine , they thought they can be friends and try to build democracy together . 
  well things change and that is why you need to maintain a ready , capable and well financed military . 
  in case things change . 
  look around you , listen to the news . 
  we do not live in a stable world . 
  you took that out of context . 
  op argued that we do n't need to create a large army , because war with russia is unlikely . 
  i said why create an army , if it could n't deal with that scenario , that is the likeliest threat for eastern european countries . 
  our current militaries are already made now to deal with that . 
  while being in nato and without an eu army , my country could deal with a russian attack on it 's own terms . 
  not only because we would be able to prepare for it as best we can , maintaining larger units , conscription , higher financing etc. 
  but also because of the help of usa and other nato allies that is binding , because this alliance in it 's spirit is military . 
  eu army i do not know , where the units would be , how fast would a decision to react would come and another problem would be retreating from a territory of conflict . 
  my countries military would not do that and stand and fight as long as possible ( until nato allies come ) . 
  eu army could figure out it 's better to let that land be occupied for a while and leave it . 
  good for you if that scenario is acceptable for you , it is n't for me or i bet it would n't be best for the people living in a possible occupation territory . 
  and as i said , i 'm not against cooperation . 
  it would be great if eu armies would make common purchases to reduce costs , train together more or go to peace keeping missions together . 
  but that is the extent of integration i find rational at the moment . 
  strange . 
  here i thought that europe , unlike the us , is not a country , but rather a continent filled with many countries . 
  well , i guess i should check the world map again . 
  the comparison between 27 eu members ** countries ** and 50 ** state governors ** is stupid . 
  eu members are separate , independent countries , with no common head of state or parliament that really binds us like it would a country . 
  i 'm not saying it would be created for the benefit of eastern europe . 
  i 'm arguing that it would have different goals in different european regions , one of which is the one eastern europe would need an eu army to carry out , and it would be unable to achieve those goals as well as an alliance of national armies . 
  the 2 % of gdp was not set 60 years ago , it was set just after the cold war . 
  during the cold war , the guideline was 3 % . 
  and if you think it 's a stupid guideline , that is your problem . 
  neither me , nor you are an expert on defence and i think they who thought of this rule were not morons . 
  but before you say anything , look at the german military or many other european militaries that do not follow or are n't even close to the 2 % standard . 
  they have tools , they have weapons . 
  but most of those weapons are unoperational , and i 'm not talking peace time unoperational , but lack of financing not working tanks , helicopters , planes etc. 
  unoperational . 
  there is a huge problem of units being filled with military personell , because they ca n't afford to fill those units up . 
  this shows , that 2 % of gdp is required if you want to maintain a military capable of carrying out the defence of your or your allies country . 
  i too wish i could live in a world , where there would not be a need for police , military or anything else , because everyone would get along fine and nobody would cause any problems whatsoever . 
  but we do not live in that world . 
  i 'm not suggesting , that the eu should spend as much money on it 's military as the us . 
  but again , why make a huge army if you 're not even going to give it the 2 % that it needs ? 
  every country would demand to have some military presence on it 's territory . 
  some countries , that face bigger threats at the moment would logically need more soldiers and equipment present . 
  europe is not a small region . 
  all this would require the eu army to be huge by default . 
  and if you wo n't finance that huge army to the level of being able to fill up it 's units , have all the necessary equipment and support equipment , it will be a paper lion . 
  why do big countries , like the us , spend a lot on their militaries ? 
  they want them to be capable and suffer the least amount of casualties in case of war . 
  i think you would want european soldiers to have an advantage in combat so we would n't suffer so many deaths . 
  guess what , that costs money . 
  no money - no technology , no technology - no battlefield superiority , no battlefield superiority - more victims . 
  you arguing that we would not need to spend money on an eu army already shows , why it would n't work . 
  different countries have different needs and to some defence is not a priority , it seems . 
  that is why a military with 27 different countries in it would not work well . 
  no , war between russia and europe is n't likely , i hope . 
  but we can not throw out this scenario with current russian leadership . 
  war with russia is the biggest security threat eastern european countries face right now and if we ca n't make an eu army that can counter that threat , why make it in the first place ? 
  i think that trade is quite different than military . 
  even in our trade deals we have clauses and exceptions to some eu countries .
