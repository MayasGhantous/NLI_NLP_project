  the guy was treating her like some kind of goddess , but theres always a chance of it being faked . 
  it was not however and after she married him and moved to egypt they were quite happy there until egypt decided to revolt and she basically had to run back to lithuania . 
  her mother had to fax ( yes , people still fax things there apparently ) her plane tickets for her to be allowed to leave . 
  the bad marriage : a guy from east came . 
  dont remmeber the country right now but it was from arabian peninsula . 
  he acted very much like how we imagine a steretypical good sensibility westerner to act . 
  from what i understand he was relatively rich , so it was quite possible he was just well educated and knew western culture . 
  as it turned out later , he was here with explicit intention of getting a wife , who turned out to be one of my friends . 
  when he brought her back home , it turns out she was his 3rd wife and the reason he wanted her was because the first two were lazy . 
  her status quickly deescalated from equal to not being able to leave the house without husbands permission . 
  thankfully the internet is pervasive nowadays so she managed to contact us home and tell us what happened , however not much could be done because everything he did was legal there . 
  that was a few years ago and shes probably still living there to the best of my knowledge . 
  have n't heard anything from her for a while . 
  now , mind you , it wasnt like she was in concentration camp or anything like that , more like the vastly different cultures resultend in her not having the basic rights such as ability to dress the clothes she liked . 
  but since the guy was pretty rich she wasnt starving or anything . 
  not being allowed to immigrate if you do not meet certain standards , as long as those standards are applied fairly to everyone , does not remove your individual freedoms any more so as having a low forbidding you to steal . 
  current statistic of britain ( not certain about other countries ) show that there is a lower percentage of immigrants on welfare than of british citizens . 
  that is , higher portion of immigrants earn their own income . 
  therefore the fears of wellfare being more than half of migrants were unfounded . 
  however the migrants have changed now so maybe this will change as well . 
  i doubt it , though . 
   post-war japan managed to avoid becoming a spineless nation careening toward a multicultural nightmare . 
  post-war japan became americas puppet and even deisgnated one of its islands as us military base . 
  the design was that japan is deprived of having its own military and us is supposed to protect them . 
  this was us making sure pearl harbor can never happen again . 
  here in lithuania gypsies arent really considered nationals either . 
  however this is not without reason . 
  their primary income comes from dealing drugs , they squalor in private property and the area they settled in have become the equivalent of ghetto . 
  while by no means all of them are such , there is a significant portion of them that dont want to be law abiding citizens . 
  and thus begins the crusade . 
  its always fun to play as papal states in eu4 . 
  islam is the fastest-growing religion in europe . 
  according to the pew research center , the muslim population in europe ( excluding turkey ) was about 30 million in 1990 , 44 million in 2010 and is expected to increase to 58 million by 2030 ; the muslim share of the population increased from 4.1 % in 1990 to 6 % in 2010 and will continue to increase over the next 40 years , reaching 10 % in 2050 . 
  there were approximately 19 million muslims in the european union in 2010 . 
  data for the rates of growth of islam in europe reveal that the growing number of muslims is due primarily to immigration and higher birth rates . 
  muslim women today have an average of 2.2 children compared to an estimated average of 1.5 children for non-muslim women in europe . 
  while the birth rate for muslims in europe is expected to decline over the next two decades , it will remain slightly higher than in the non-muslim population , except for dutch-turks , who have a lower birthrate ( 1.7 ) than the native dutch population ( 1.8 ) . 
  based on the current growth rate of islam in europe , in 2030 , muslims are projected to make up more than 10 % of the total population in 10 european countries : kosovo ( 93.5 % ) , albania ( 83.2 % ) , bosnia-herzegovina ( 42.7 % ) , republic of macedonia ( 40.3 % ) , montenegro ( 21.5 % ) , bulgaria ( 15.7 % ) , russia ( 14.4 % ) , georgia ( 11.5 % ) , france ( 10.3 % ) and belgium ( 10.2 % ) . 
  there are around 100,000 muslim converts in the uk . 
  france has seen conversions to the islamic faith double in the past quarter century . 
  in france there are an estimated 100,000 muslim converts , compared with about 50,000 in 1986 . 
  ** boom , statistics attack : ** to all these people saying that muslim extremists are a minority and , for this reason , it is n't a problem with islam are being ridiculous .

  yes . 
  but it is a * significant * minority . 
  we ca n't close our ears and say `` it 's just a few extremists , it has nothing to do with actual islam '' , because it does have to do with islam . 
  it is a significant portion of muslims who are committing these actions or believe these actions to be justified because of their religion . 
  the very act of trying to distance islam from islam-inspired terrorism committed by muslims is ridiculous . 
  sure , there 's nothing wrong with being a muslim and holding moderate views , and the majority of muslims in the west are moderates , but we ca n't pretend that extremism is n't relevant to muslim culture . 
  a story written by a head of pr without a single piece of evidence to support it sure sounds suspiciuos . 
  even if we ignore this and assume this to be true , it is nothing more than anecdotal experience . 
  except that those ideas have actual statistical data to back them up and this only has one persons anecdotical example that he cant even prove happened . 
  i think by the time doomsday happens its going to be too late to predict doomsday . 
  i never got the concept of `` wait and see if things go bad '' . 
  the whole point of prodiction is so we could avoid things going back . 
  if we wait till things go back its already too late . 
  hardly . 
  though at one point we may reach a breaking point where we can no longer pretend there is no problems with different cultures refusing to integrate when they come . 
   but i like to tell everyone else they are . 
   their facebook profiles are linked in the source by the way , if you 're after pictures ... 
  the profile has no pictures of the refugees . 
  maximum efficiency !, 
  thats kinda the problem . 
  `` marriage '' as a term is used to describe church marriage while legal one is usually refered as legal union . 
  therefore the campaigning should be for same sex legal union rights , not same sex marriage rights . 
  though from what i understand in some countries there is a problem of legal unions having less rights than church marriage which is a problem that should be solved as well . 
  extremes are bad whether its left or right . 
  good thing most people arent extremists , then . 
  really now ? 
  i havent seen anyone treaten you . 
  in fact you are being upvoted despite making generalized sweeping statements full of hyperbole . 
  interesting , i saw a lot of scepticism in almost every thread in this subreddit . 
  how did you came to this conclusion ? 
  facebook post without backing up evidence should always be dismissed until proven correct . 
   ceos of large companies are more powerful than international leaders . 
  considering that ceos sometimes flat out buy national leaders ... considering that companies are often larger than even middle-sized economy country nowdays ... 
  in the capitalistic world we live in companies are becoming more and more powerful every day . 
  heck , even the us military is now outsourced to private contractors .
