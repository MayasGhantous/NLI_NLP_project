  * and again muscovy buds in . 
  in lithuania nazi or soviet symbolics are seen as a part of horrible past . 
  for those kind of sybolics especially the soviet ones we have [ grutas park ] ( http://www.grutoparkas.lt/?lang=gb ) . 
  if you want your history lesson on lithuania during soviet stay you can visit [ museum of genocide victims ] ( http://www.genocid.lt/muziejus/en/ ) . 
  then you can tell us how wonderful it is to have those kind of sybolics on full display . 
  and with this logic russia starts to take bits of baltics or anyother nato member , or finland . 
  so you would intervene or you would still fear for ww3 ? 
  you mean [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b8/breznev-honecker_1979.jpg ) right ? 
  now russia is feeling oppressed by lgbt . 
  but lithuania likes kebab . 
  i mean literally . 
  this is actually a very good idea . 
  but what about visa itself ? 
  i doubt you would be able to find a job . 
  with that comes the question of place to live . 
  it might be that you or your kids will write something similar after 10 or 20 years . 
  so it is a message for you as well . 
  we do , sadly not a lot of them . 
  i believe i have even better solution : come to lithuania . 
  it is could and miserable half a year , you may like it . 
  at first , when i started reading it was kind of schadenfreude for me . 
  but then it hit me , that as of this moth our minimum salary is $ 325 per month . 
  and that is the best we have managed so far . 
  and yes , our average salary is way above that ( something like $ 700 ) , but still we kind of know how dark and scary is to earn so little . 
  i believe we did that early last year . 
  not necessarily . 
  it simply shows that lithuanians are less tolerant for minimal wage than our neighbors ( latvia , poland and estonia ) . 
  also it helps that we have more foreign investment per capita than any of the neighbors aswell . 
  we are not that low . 
  we are grand duchy of lithuania !, 
  oh wait ... no more ? 
  russia kind of banned eu imports and that did a number of prices in their market . 
  what i am surprised about is that latvia is falling behind . 
  what happened there , latvia ? 
  lithuania did the same . 
  as of july 1 minimum wage in lithuania is $ 325 . 
  it is still the lowest of the three baltic states ( latvia - $ 360 , estonia $ 390 ), 
  use / s just so we know that you are joking . 
  imo life is great here !, 
  that is a lot of abuse . 
  but no answers . 
   what ? 
  when did i say ` terrorized ? ', 
  let me remind you what you said yourself :  no , they 've perfected the art of swapping around national leaders like chess pieces and using proxy armies to terrorize populations  how poorly informed are you ? 
  i mean , have you been paying any attention at all to the news over the last decade at all ? 
  again , i 'm asking not for a news report . 
  i 'm asking for your well rounded opinion based on facts . 
  so , could you name me these long -- term effects ? 
   no , there is no natural port near sochi . 
  you ca n't just create a port wherever you want , it relies on natural geographic features . 
  tell that to united arab emirates they had no natural ports although they do have ports . 
  i think russia could make the port too . 
  it would be not the first crazy idea . 
  like [ reversing a river ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_river_reversal ) . 
  and as far as natural ports go here is some : novorossiysk , gelendzhik , taman bay , sadki , yeysk , trud , and the oldest known in the area - azov . 
  so it is no excuse as well . 
  and you assume that lithuanian and other baltic , georgian people are terrorized into submission ? 
  do you think we live in fear of us ? 
   the actual real world long-term effects could you name me these long-term effects ? 
   they 've perfected the art of swapping around national leaders russia as i understand did n't perfect it so it just attacked ukraine right ? 
  germany already paid for their crimes . 
  they did n't bankrupt ( with a help form us ) did they ? 
  ussr break up because of the political climate in the country , as well as social and economic reasons , and not because nato or us demanded it . 
  i am sure that for a country as huge as russia is there was not place for a port somewhere near sochi ? 
  it is life or death , it should be land of the other sovereign country . 
  what kind of fucked up logic is that ? 
  the same goes for crimean referendum , protests in russia aswell right ? 
  us at fault ? 
  it 's like they could n't come up with anything else so they used that . 
  let 's attack someone !, 
  not us this time , poland . 
  russia , please fix the historical mistakes and give k\u00f6nigsberg back to germany and please pay for your war crimes to the baltic states aswell . 
  thank you in advance . 
   us did everything it could to destabilize the corrupt but stable yanukovych and get their chosen corrupt patsies put in office . 
  nice try , now go watch more rt. 
  so basically there is only black and white ? 
  and you would like to paint russia white by trying to compare count of military conflicts ? 
  and how about annexing or parts of the countries ? 
  did the west do any of that ? 
  so you are saying that we have no right to defend ? 
  thanks . 
  funny how vilnius falls out of context . 
  compared to the other two cities vilnius feels like a little town with an enormous old town . 
  l'viv / lvovas munich/miunchenas warsaw/var \u0161uva do n't even ask . ^ vilnius ^ not ^ wilno, 
  not only in eu4, 
  yes , that 's how it is as far as i know . 
  except jonin\u0117s which is national holiday . 
  either krak\u00f3w or budapest . 
  [ let me help you . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zxdo4dl7su ), 
  ukraine was a part of glorious lithuania ^ once !, 
  but we exported some tech-savvy workers to the uk now we need new work force . 
  evil empire of samogitia stronk !, 
  well , atleast we do n't have 1.3 million spare people . 
  never confuse us for russians . 
  probably [ \u00f0 ] sound . 
  and they say baltics are freaking out a bit too much ... 
  baltijos probably refers to a baltic sea . 
  or a baltic region that we call baltija .
