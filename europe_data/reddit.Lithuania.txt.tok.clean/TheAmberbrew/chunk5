  i believe , since 1994 or so our goverment have asked for compensation for deportations and ruined businesses . 
  russia always answers the same way : it was the government of the other country , that did it . 
  and every time they ask of something that is somehow is connected with ussr , we always remind them about the compensation and thier claim that it was the government of the other country . 
  you can still go to hungary . 
  i remember paying for ice cream like 250 forints . 
  it is not in thousands but still a crazy way to count money . 
  poland expensive ? 
  even for lithuanians poland is n't expensive . 
  once we tried that . 
  and ... well ... you can see where we are now . 
  i just used belarusian spelling . 
  it 's not like we want the union or anything . ^ baka !, 
  i somehow missed the new maps he did . 
  [ reddit is at fault here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35yr8g/you_get_to_redraw_one_section_of_border_in_europe/cr9s13h ), 
  i have read an interesting peace on this . 
  author argued that around 30 % of emigrants will be returning until 2020 exactly for the reason you just pointed out . 
  i kind of you you are right . 
  that is so similar in lithuania . 
  although the sentiment of leaving is barely noticeable . 
  i think it is because everyone who wanted to leave already left . 
  but i am kind of happy that politicians started panicking over the issue . 
  now they kind of trying to find a solution . 
  why would you hate estonia ? 
  we had running jokes about estonians being slow . 
  now jokes on us . 
  dammit estonia , you had to ruin it . 
  welcome to lithuania !, 
  fixed it , even though it worked for me just fine . 
  ] ( http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/publications/reports/hiding-in-plain-sight-putin-s-war-in-ukraine-and-boris-nemtsov-s-putin-war ), 
  nice try , putin . 
  politics . 
  no one would hurt . 
  but , oh man politics . 
  and the the investment to eastern eu members would stop entirely . 
  unless we lower our minimum wage . 
  which is already so low that uk is suffering from our migrants . 
  oh man , i have a very mixed feelings . 
  for one , i do know a lot of ethnic russians , and most of them are friendly and good people . 
  i adore classic russian literature , i like classic russian music , as well as some of russian rock songs . 
  everything about their pre-soviet culture had something attractive . 
  but after fall of the soviet union , transformation of russia was very odd . 
  and i say that knowing that russians and lithuanians lived more or less in the same culture bubble . 
  to start with , since the fall of soviet union i see as very materialistic nation . 
  but that materialism has a very odd color . 
  for one they do not pay much attention to their surroundings , but their homes have so much decoration , to the point it might feel overdecorated . 
  they will buy relatively new cars but their road infrastructure is very lacking . 
  at the same time i am afraid of their driving culture . 
  russians take pride in their nation . 
  at the same time putting a lot of hate on usa . 
  they try to act like a great power . 
  but ever since the fall of soviet union they traded ( especially in bigger deals ) using us dollar and continuing doing so . 
  not their ruble . 
  for the great power , they can not produce anything worth exporting , comparable to western products . 
  since fall of su i did n't see or hear of any good russian movie or book . 
  for a country as huge as russia not to produce anything worth noticing for their neighbor is at least sad . 
  i feel like their culture is falling into of horrific drunk , opressed , aggresive and sad cultural swamp with a beautiful western style welcome sign saying : we hear 140 million voices . 
  and this image , not to mention political situation deeply saddens me . 
  i would love to hear modern russian tchaikovsky , or read todays tolstoy , dostoyevsky , lermontov , gogol , goncharov , turgenev and many others . 
  todays russia does not attract me in the slightest , it feels like without it 's military might , russia is even smaller than lithuania . 
  and as native lithuanian and geographer i am sorry to say so . 
  edit : typo , grammar, 
  for a fact number 4 , latvia is actually [ ranked 13th ] ( http://www.netindex.com/download/2,39/latvia/ ) . ^ lithuania ^ is ^ ranked ^ 5th ... 
  to tell you the truth , russian song was good , at least for me personally . 
  but that message coming form russia sounds way too suspicious . 
  and since we ( lithuanians ) already are exposed to a lot of russian propaganda , it is very hard to believe in their message . 
  even for a russian speakers here . 
  i believe we have only one town visaginas with over 50 % russian speakers . 
  and in the capital vilnius we have 12 % russian speakers and 16 % polish . 
  is it me , or everyone was shocked when lithuania gave 12 points to latvia while leaving russia with 0 ? 
  please never visit lithuania . 
  so now russia killing russian soldiers is news ? 
  that moment when name strikes as lithuanian . 
  you will not buy us with your kebabs ^ said ^ nobody ^ ever, 
  tl ; dr * how to scare people easily ( \u041a\u0430\u043a \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 ) talks about how he was watched , he has been wiretapped . 
  he states that every day every hotel room is being checked by vsd ( security agency of the state ) as well as vsd controlled everything he did while being in lithuania . 
  * country of frauds and snitches ( \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0439 ) i 'm not even sure if i need to tell what is written here . 
  * how large is the population of russian speakers in lithuania ( \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u044f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432 \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0435 ? ), 
  in truth , a lot . 
  it is more than [ official 5 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuania ) , in truth a lot more . 
  and then author claims everyone speaks russian daily . 
  * who is the biggest threat to lithuanian security ? 
  the main theme is about lithuanian relation with  \u0421\u0428\u0410 us . 
  it mostly states that you relation is cold and we do not trust the us . 
  * like dangerous resellers ( \u041a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 ) * are lithuanians scared of war with russia ? 
  anti-russian sentiment is a cancer to lithuanian elite ( \u0420\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0444\u043e\u0431\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c \u043b\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u044d\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044b ) i am sorry if i missed something . 
  i will try to edit this post later for more info if no one else translates it for you . 
  [ do you mean ? 
  k\u00f6nigsberg to germany , grodno to lithuania . 
  honestly i do n't think this is necessary . 
  who in thier right mind does n't want to feel atleast somewhat important ? 
  [ can we make a tour through belarus , russia , ukraine , moldova aswell ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/lithuaniahistory.png ), 
  this seems to be the case . 
  i have to mention this : according to the polls top three enemies of russia is us , poland , lithuania . 
  i 'm not even kidding . 
  well it seems [ rimi is owned by sweden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ica_ab ) . 
  thank you sweden for rimi . 
  we need them for our evil intentions aswell . 
  do n't be mad senpai !, 
  * thank you uk norway and denmark for taking care of our migrants .
