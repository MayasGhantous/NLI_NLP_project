i 'm just gon na go ahead and tell y' all that op 's account is 16 days old and all of their comments are pro-russian and pro-soviet , and against sovereign eastern europe , especially the baltics ( yes , op , i take personal offense in you calling lithuanians a shitty nation ) . 
  this is not even closely related to this discussion , but just beware when engaging in discussion with them - it 's absolutely pointless . 
  `` the soviets did nothing wrong , y' all '' .

  i really do n't get reddit sometimes . 
  edit : just to clarify what i meant by not getting reddit is its attitude towards personal privacy and celebrity privacy . 
  i might be naive , but at this point we 're so used to russia bullying us that there 's not much to be scared of . 
  also , we 're part of both eu and nato . 
  okay , i 'm pretty ( absolutely ) sure the one you put as french lenin is , in fact , the most famous lenin statue in lithuania . 
  it was located in the city centre of vilnius at luki\u0161ki\u0173 square and was dismantled in 1991 , and now you can find it at gr\u016bto parkas , as you can see from the pictures here : [ ( original location ) ] ( https://www.google.lt/search?q=france+-+montpellier&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=hnhtu4ygg-lgyqo-94gwca&amp;ved=0cagq_auoaq&amp;biw=1339&amp;bih=645#q=lenino+paminklas+luki%c5%a1ki%c5%b3+aik%c5%a1t%c4%97je&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgdii=_ ) and here : [ ( a picture taken at gr\u016bto parkas ) ] ( http://i3.alfi.lt/46/70/90.jpg ) maybe there was a french sculpture that was modeled after the lithuanian one ? 
  screw you , we do n't need no mountains . 
  what 's the point of them anyway , besides getting schumacher into coma ? 
  damn , now i wish someone made ( modern ) tv series about vytautas . 
  he 's probably the ruler we 're most proud of . 
  iirc , at first there was a wooden castle built by gediminas . 
  then it burned down . 
  and then vytautas rebuilt it as a brick castle ( so it 's technically vytautas ' castle on gediminas ' hill ) ... ... aaaaaaand then russian empire ravaged it and burned it down again . 
  seriously , i can be wrong , but from what i remember , it was burned down at least 3 times . 
  come on , not again . 
  * rolls eyes * it has n't worked the numerous times they tried that before , it wo n't work now . 
  there 's not much to fear after stalin . 
  not to mention the fact that zhirinovsky is completely nuts in general . 
  [ gim me a power washer and a lot of rope , and i 'll do it for free . 
  you see what you want to see . 
  i never said that the newspapers do n't count , i only said that one thing does not void the other . 
  okay , let 's break this down . 
  i agree with you that tabloids do count , because those articles are , in fact , propaganda , we do n't know for sure and probably wo n't ever know who truly was behind the downing of that plane . 
  however , you ca n't possibly deny that the russian poster is propaganda as well . 
  and you ca n't deny that it 's racist . 
  which makes op 's title accurate , no ? 
  op does n't even embelish - it 's really exactly what it says on the tin . 
  it 's not math , two minuses do n't make a plus here . 
  you should n't justify obvious racism just because shitty british newspapers ( what was on the front page of the guardian ? ), 
  post this in their newspapers . 
  honestly , do you think we have ghettos for polish people or labour camps ? 
  poles have not been discriminated `` since ever '' - actually a couple of hundred years ago polish language and culture were considered to be high-class , while everything lithuanian was for peasants . 
  the relationship between two countries has been rocky for the last century , sure ( the occupation of vilnius , anyone ? 
  we even joined the fucking soviet union to get it back ) , but i 'm reading your comments in this thread and i just do n't get it why you hate lithuania so much . 
  now excuse my while i go and call my best friend , who 's lithuanian polish and i 've never ever heard her talk about discrimination . 
  polish minority in lithuania gets all the same rights determined by the constitution as do other minorities and lithuanian people . 
  a child from a polish-speaking family can attend a polish kindergarden , a polish school , where even history lesson are centered around polish history rather than lithuanian history , and they essentially do n't need to use lithuanian language until they take exams at the end of the 12th grade . 
  we have our problems with minorities , as do all countries , but treating polish speaking minority in lithuania as second class citizens is not one of them . 
  just a heads up - / u/neoromantique is an avid russian supporter . 
  discussing politics with him is the same as discussing politics with a sack of bricks . 
  he spams all the threads that might be anti-russian and all threads about lithuania , his homecountry ( because we 're literally the worst country ever where the elections are being sabotaged , because no one in his hometown ( where the majority of people are either russian or polish ) voted for our current president ) . 
  my res karma count for him is -40 at the moment , because each time someone tries to argue with him , he just ignores all of their points and keeps repeating the same two or three arguments over and over . 
  just ignoring him should work best . 
  it 's a bit too late , but i just have to say that there 's no point in trying to discuss things with / u/neoromantique - i have him at -30 points in res already from a few months ago . 
  i do n't know why , but he absolutely loves shitting on lithuania on reddit . 
  yeah , that 's the point of the thread , but * you * replied to op in a way that sounds like you 're arguing with them about * their opinion * on the borders . 
  i do n't have a problem with people in this thread who stated that they think the baltics belong to the eastern europe , but i really do n't think you should be lecturing me , because your original comment is no better than mine . 
  the first sentence in wikipedia on baltic states : the baltic states are three * northern * european countries east of the baltic sea . 
  i 'd say geographically we 're northern european , culturally - we 're our own separate being .

  from wikipedia on lithuanian coat of arms : `` jonas trink\u016bnas , the leader of a neo-pagan movement romuva , believes that in the lithuanian mythology vytis represents perk\u016bnas , a god of thunder . 
  it is believed that the vytis may represent perk\u016bnas as supreme god or kovas who was also a war god and has been depicted as a horseman since ancient times . '', 
  ma\u017eoji lietuva is real in my heart , man . 
  shoot , that 's what you get when you let / u/alikont in on a secret . 
  man , that guy ruins the surprise for the rest of us . 
  wait , when did we get the 4th baltic state ? 
  do n't worry , braliukas , we 'll take care of you , as we 'll only lose klaip\u0117da . 
  we could even start a brand new and almighty baltic empire . 
  not really . 
  the most popular surnames in lithuania are kazlauskas , jankauskas , petrauskas , stankevi\u010dius and such . 
  people with these surnames are predominantly lithuanian . 
  sure , the endings are not lithuanian , but that 's because most of the surnames had to deal with * forced * polonisation and russification . 
  i have neither polish , nor russian blood in my family , but we have surnames ending with - auskas and - avi\u010dius on both sides of my family . 
  people who are ethnically polish will usually have names that sound polish . 
  for example , i had a classmates whose surnames were kalenkovi\u010d and zykovi\u010d . 
  the only surname i can think of , that could be considered foreign is the one ending with - ovas , like solovjovas . 
  ummm ... no ? 
  if you 're talking about places like \u0160al\u010dininkai ( where the majority of people are , in fact , ethnically polish ) , then sure . 
  but lithuanians are definitely ethnically lithuanian . 
  the highest parts of society were polonized in the commonwealth , the rest of society ( and especially the western part of lithuania ) remained lithuanian . 
  that 's why we 're a separate country .

  many people from belarus come to vilnius ... to go shopping . 
  if you go to the biggest shopping centres on the weekend , half of the cars in the parking lot will have belarusian licence plates . 
  just to make it clear , people in the orange part speak proper lithuanian , however , many people in and around \u0160al\u010dininkai area speak tutejsi , or a sort of strange polish dialect . 
  hey , at least part of kaliningrad was lithuania minor ( or the `` little lithuania '' as we called it ) back in the day , so we call dibs on that part . 
  according to euromaidan twitter - she was killed by the security agency .
