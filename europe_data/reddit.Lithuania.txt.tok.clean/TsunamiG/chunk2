  sadly , aging thing is true . 
  not for 30 + , but definately for 60 +, 
  yes , i actually read one scientific article about pil\u0117nai , and it was written there that suicide is in lithuanian mentality since forever . 
  well , that 's who we are i guess . 
  well , i like food . 
  however , i think it 's because older people in lithuania tend to get fat . 
  they stop caring about their weight and they do n't have any knowledge about healthy food . 
  you can see a lot of skinny young people in lithuania , but elders are mostly slightly overweight . 
  as a result the most common causes of death in lithuania are strokes and heart attacks . 
  i remember when i was a child a lot of people were using lard instead oil etc. 
  but now people are getting used to using olive oil instead of butter and eating more fruits and vegetables . 
  damn you , beautiful countries with all those mountains , why are you so lucky : /, 
  zobens - ass :d sir , you made me laugh, 
  so nobody knows nothing about estonia . 
  because i have n't met any single person ( estonians included ) who seriously thinks that estonia is nordic . 
  congratulations , you are the first . 
  maybe you have the best knowledge about estonia in the world , including some secret-estonia-nordic things . 
  ok , the whole world is stupid because nearly everybody thinks that estonia is not nordic . 
  you have the knowledge , you have the right thinking . 
  you are the blessed one to know and understand this general truth , and everybody else is just living in the dark . 
  no , really , are you internet troll or smth ? 
  getting really tired of this . 
  i guess as we in lithuania have some people who do n't want to admit our close ties with poland , you in estonia have people who do n't want to admit that they are baltic . 
  that 's cool with me , you can think of yourself whatever you want , but that does n't change the fact that nobody in the world seriously thinks that way . 
  you trying to prove that all arguments that estonia is baltic are `` empty '' . 
  well your argument that a serb can not know anything about estonia is soooo hilarious . 
  obviously , foreigners know more about your country than yourself , 
  i guarantee that most estonians feel baltic , this dude thinks he 's nordic . 
  there are people who think they are napoleons . 
  do n't waste your time trying to prove something to him :d, 
  latvian looks younger , but eesti is more handsome :d, 
  ha ha . 
  now i see - inferiority complex . 
  no point discussing anything more with you , as i see my arguments strong enough against yours , but you choose to ignore them . 
  good luck trying to be nordic , seriously , 
  xx century history , similar goals and interests , similar stand in world political scene , economical situation . 
  and what exactly makes estonia nordic ? 
  language ? 
  sorry , you are as baltic as latvia and lithuania , deal with it . 
  learn to be proud of who you actually are . 
  it 's sad that you think so , personally i believe , that we have a lot in common . 
  and yes , i believe that estonia is more baltic than nordic and that we should stick together . 
  that 's what i meant by `` wanna-be-nordic '' , 
  so nice of you , wanna-be-nordics , 
  according to the [ latest poll ] ( http://www.vilmorus.lt/index.php?mact=news,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=6&amp;cntnt01returnid=20 ) the only kind-of-relevant far-right party of lithuania ( `` tvarka ir teisingumas '' ) would get 7,7 percent of votes in the parliamentary election . 
  as far as i remember , comparing to previous polls , their popularity is decreasing . 
  so , in the case of lithuania , socialdemocrats , liberals and conservatives are the most popular parties and they all are very similar on the scale of nationalism , which is not far-right . 
  thank you , no . 
  italian and french , 
  so , lithuania and poland are the best , commonwealth intensifies,

  like ... game of thrones ? 
  thanks , changed it , 
  i think lithuania is a bit underrated , but it 's mostly because of infrastructure issues - no european railway , no national airlines . 
  however , if you would like to visit , i would recommend riding a bike from klaip\u0117da to [ neringa ] ( http://platumos.lt/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dji00156_nida.jpg ) and visit [ four villages ] ( http://vijune.svetaine.lt/images/neringa.jpg ) on your way : juodkrant\u0117 , pervalka , preila and nida . 
  this should take about 2 days ( 50 kilometers or so ) . 
  if you like visiting cultural sites , i would recommend vilnius and kaunas , as most of the cultural sites and museums are located there . 
  i heard that [ roki\u0161kis ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/32808716.jpg ) is marvelous , but i have never been there . 
  it 's on my `` must visit '' list . 
  they also have an amazing [ mansion ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/rokiskis_palace.jpg ) . 
  edit : changed broken link, 
  i think because i started at the age of 8 . 
  it is much more easier to learn a new language when you are a child . 
  i have much more trouble learning the second one now . 
  [ vilnius university ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vilnius_university ) . 
  founded in 1579 , top university in lithuania . 
  and it [ looks very fancy ] ( http://www.15min.lt/images/photos/616179/original/26115473_l-55a13d023c640.jpg ) , 
  i rent a flat from my next door neighbour ( she is a senior ) . 
  and basically seniors are living all around . 
  so as long as i do n't make wild parties and i say hello everytime i see them ( and help to call an electrician , yes , sometimes they ask ) , we are good , 
  latvia : braliukas poland : commonwealth estonia : pr everywhere united kingdom : queen , history italy : too much chill czech republic : beer france : posh , fashion greece : holidays , financial problems switzerland : banks , cheese ireland : beer , st. patrick germany : cars , wursts , beer , money sweden : banks , investitions norway : fish and oil finland : sauna and vodka netherlands : bikes , weed and sunny ( i do n't know why , i 've never been there , but i think there 's always sunny ) denmark : andersen , little mermaid and sea slovenia : basketball slovakia : mountains croatia : kings landing , beaches hungary : orban romania : heat bulgaria : rose water portugal : porto wine and ocean malta : queen 's holiday, 
  i do n't know where to begin actually and i 'm kinda surprised by this question . 
  common history , historical public figures , mentality , struggles . 
  a lot of things are similar . 
  culturally i would say poland . 
  but we would be a `` younger brother '' again in this kind of union . 
  so , after cost-benefit analysis , i would choose latvia . 
  yes , same in lithuania . 
  there were already two women running for president in lithuania in 1926 . 
  [ grilled bread ] ( http://www.banketai24.lt/uploads/products/product_35/img_8536_656x484.jpg ), 
  cool , a new york in europe !, 
  breakfast - around 7:30 -8:00 lunch - 12:00 then i have something in between work and university ( snack , around 16:00 ) dinner - 20:00, 
  pirtis is not a public space !, 
  or winter , straight after pirtis . 
  and drinking vodka with the sound of `` urrrh '' afterwards, 
  i always thought that finland sounds like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ) like people are walking in the streets with this music playing in the background, 
  lithuania sounds like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l0yiesxaxk ) film , which sums up most old lithuanian films - boring with no action . 
  however , as i live next to one of the busiest streets in vilnius - lithuania sounds like a neverending traffic to me : /, 
  and yet i feel completely safe in lithuania . 
  and my work is in law enforcement . 
  most of the crimes are drunk people having fights . 
  i would feel somehow ... if we had one :(, 
  that 's it , i 'm making it this weekend . 
  it just looks too good . 
  it 's not difficult to make at all . 
  you just need 2 special ingredients , which i consider more difficult to find in regular western european shops . 
  it 's [ kefir ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kefir ) and dill ( which i could n't find anywhere in uk , surprisingly ) . 
  all the other ingredients - boiled beetroots , cucumbers , eggs and spring onions - are just chopped in the kefir . 
  i like \u0161altibar\u0161\u010diai to be thinner , so i add water , but it 's up to you .
