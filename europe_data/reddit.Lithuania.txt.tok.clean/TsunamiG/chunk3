  salt it and voila . 
  is it popular in latvia ? 
  in lithuania it is considered as national dish and it is extremely popular - people eat it at least once a week in summer . 
  everybody knows how to make it and everybody loves it . 
  i remember making it while studying abroad in uk . 
  i found lithuanian market , so i gathered all the lithuanian products easily . 
  but i was so disappointed when some of my british flatmates refused to try it because `` it 's pink '' . 
  wtf , who cares , when it is so good . 
  people should not be scared by the colour of it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raclette#dish ) ( swiss ) one of the best foods that is n't very mainstream ( at least in lithuania ) . 
  i discovered it only when i went to lugano . 
  raclette is actually pretty amazing , one of the best dishes i 've ever had . 
  being erasmus student in university of essex . 
  sooo crazy . 
  partying in tallinn . 
  living in central london for 2 weeks . 
  just on my own , so i could do anything i want . 
  berlin , couchsurfing with best friend and being hosted by the most strange dude i 've ever met . 
  so , generally , being a student in europe is awesome , 
  this one is advertising a military academy , but i like it  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzgh7ix-r1s, 
  i 'm talking about russian , 
  one thing that annoys me the most about cyrillic - they do n't have letter `` h '' , so they say things like `` garry potter '' and `` sherlock cholms '', 
   fuck you lithuania for not having a sizeable unintegrated minority . 
  yup , that 's one thing to be proud of , sorry , braliukas  but we have a thing going with poles , so even though it 's not sizeable , on the other hand it seems more aggressive : /, 
  sorry , thank you for a correction , i 've edited that , 
  i remember asking one italian about the italian town called siena . 
  i asked for the meaning , and he sead it 's like `` wall , fortress '' . 
  and in lithuanian `` siena '' is `` wall '' . 
  maybe that does not mean anything , but that was a surprise for me  there is actually a ~ ~ theory ~ ~ myth that lithuanians originated from italians , from duke [ palemonas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palemonids ), 
  agree about eesti nordic . 
  they are getting too cocky . 
  i think i know more about slovenia . 
  better basketball team . 
  and european championship in 2013 . 
  good economy , small , very beautiful ( like italy ) , has a lake called bled , which reminds me of a certain curse word . 
  what i know about slovakia - they have mountains . 
  when i think of montenegro , i always think of `` casino royale '', 
  at first i thought of greater income inequality , but then checked some facts and apparently we have greater income inequality than latvians . 
  so i do n't know :( there are many possible factors though , one of them - being more generous employers . 
  well , that 's shameful . 
  however , i get around average salary and i do n't complain at the moment . 
  i can afford to rent a room ( in a flat with my friend 15 minutes away from the city centre ) , i can buy normal food ( i mean i can eat what i really want and eat at the restaurant at least 2-3 times a week ) and i buy some clothes and stuff i need . 
  what i can not afford is car and luxurious stuff or posh vacation . 
  but as i 'm still 23 years old , i do n't care that much and i know that everything will get better . 
  the other question is how people who are married with kids afford everything with that salary . 
  i can not imagine . 
  maybe because it 's `` people you know '' , so it is statistically insignificant observation . 
  i assume that most of the lower-middle class people with secondary education ( or less than that ) still dream about that , as the jobs they can get are better-payed there . 
  i think most lithuanian answers were actually `` oh noooo , i was planning to emigrate to lond\u0117 soon '', 
  i personally prefer muesli over anything else . 
  kellogg 's is popular ( cornflakes , frosties ) , as well as nestle ( nesquik , cini minis etc. ), 
  and some lithuanian cereals ( like `` oho '' , but they are disgusting to me ) . 
  talking about porridges , i always choose buckwheat . 
  why exactly ? 
  nothing in common , except few years of friendship ( in the period of president adamkus ) because of russian attacks . 
  that 's it . 
  russia of course, 
  hm , for me ( and people around me ) rimi is far better than maxima . 
  nicer shops , more space , better quality and greater variety of fruits and vegetable . 
  super what ? 
  i met some canadians when i was studying abroad . 
  they are nice , but i could n't tell difference between them and americans . 
  they all were `` very excited '' about everything and very loud , which was a surprise for me , as i imagined canadian way of communicating would be more similar to european . 
  weather - i imagine , that it 's very cold and you have lots of snow . 
  i watched one video on youtube and i was surprised how border between usa and canada is very strict ( if i can use that word ) . 
  i really do n't understand why usa and canada do n't have a version of schengen zone between them - they are 2 well-developed countries and i thing migration should be much more simple than it is now . 
  northern part of lithuania - bir\u017eai , pasvalys , pakruojis . 
  these towns have an old tradition of beer brewing , you can go on `` beer routes '' ( like [ this ] ( http://www.rinkuskiai.lt/page/en/wide/pub/ekskursijos-degustacijos-3 ) or similar ) , and it is pretty beautiful there - nice palaces ( like the largest manor in lithuania - [ pakruojis manor ] ( http://www.efoto.lt/files/images/4914/img_317.jpg ) ) . 
  i did n't hear that northern lithuania is popular among tourists though . 
  i heard that this project is very appreciated in the un ( and confirmed by it ) , so i think everything is ok with nato . 
  every mutual defense option is a benefit for the alliance . 
  yes . 
  and what annoys me the most - that all movies on tv are dubbed except russian ( subtitled ) . 
  thanks god for netflix now  oh , and all movies in cinemas are subtitled ( only children movies are dubbed ) . 
  [ it 's the happiest country in asia and 8th happiest in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bhutan ) moreover , no invasions , as mountains cover everything . 
  agricultural , happy and alone . 
  a dream for lithuanians . 
  some people say that they can recognize if a person is from kaunas . 
  they say that people from kaunas has their own way of talking . 
  as i am from kaunas , i see no difference from an official language . 
  i tried to google it , but i found almost nothing . 
  do you , fellow lithuanians , notice some kind of different way of speaking in kaunas ? 
  i am studying for my master 's degree now in lithuania , and at the moment i ca n't see any way to move there with the same opportunities i have here . 
  i mean , i doubt that i could find a qualified job there , and it 's pretty expensive to move there without a particular job opportunity considering that i do n't have any family members or friends in london who could help me in the beginning . 
  i do n't say that i 'm not thinking about that , but i just need to consider some things before doing something that costly ( bearing in mind that i do n't want to share a lousy room with six other people ) . 
  i 'm just secure about that . 
  but maybe , one day ... , 
  uk , london . 
  so lively , so interesting , multicultural . 
  museums , food , pubs . 
  i really like british . 
  i like their humour and all the strange things they do , the way they behave . 
  they are not very friendly at first , but that 's ok - i do not like people that are smiling all the time and start being your `` best friend '' from the moment you meet . 
  so i like that british people are a bit grumpy  oh , and i adore their politeness . 
  president dalia grybauskait\u0117 speaks lithuanian , english , russian , polish and french . 
  [ some lithuanian village - gra\u017ei\u0161kiai ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/graziskiai_coa.gif ), 
  no shoes , leave them by the door . 
  it is very disrespectful - we would n't say anything about it , but we would silently think that a person who does n't take off his shoes is very impolite . 
  [ oak . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/zibiku_azuolas_2006-08-20.jpg ) many lithuanian folk songs includes word `` oak '' ( '' \u0105\u017euolas '' ) as it symbolises strength , masculinity and our nature .
