  [ the other dream team ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606829/ ) : `` the incredible story of the 1992 lithuanian basketball team , whose athletes struggled under soviet rule , became symbols of lithuania 's independence movement , and - with help from the grateful dead - triumphed at the barcelona olympics . '', 
  [ forrest of gods ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453366/ ) - `` the story about one man - an artist and an intellectual - who was imprisoned by two brutal regimes , the nazis and the soviets . '', 
  [ ekskursante ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3274484/ ) - maybe not very historical , but i like it - `` the story of a ten year old girl who escapes from a deportee train and goes on a 6000 km long journey back to her homeland . '', 
  hello fellow lithuanians , i see this thread is popular amongst us !, 
  ( i wonder why ) i had just 4 hours of sleep and i will have 4 exams in upcoming 2 weeks . 
  oh and that includes full-time job . 
  and adult life . 
  i have absolutely no time for my hobbies . 
  too much to choose from . 
  those blocks are everywhere . 
  i could go on and on . 
  wow , looks good for us , 
  lithuania church on christmas , easter and other special occasions . 
  traditions ( like praying before christmas eve dinner etc. ), 
  yes , and you can register a gender neutral surname now . 
  but only married women ( sometimes ) do that , so if you see a woman with a gender neutral surname , you still know that she is married :d, 
  i do n't know about any dresses , but my surname tells everyone that i 'm unmarried . 
  in lithuania we have different surnames for married and unmarried women . 
  so mother and daughter do n't have the same surname in any family . 
  do n't worry , thanks god we are northern europe , it 's not about us . 
  it 's a good thing to have western hopes and dreams . 
  it keeps us moving , 
  wow , your prices are sick , sorry to hear that . 
  i pay 10 euros per month for my internet and the speed is 27 mbps/42 mbps which is sooo enough for me, 
  yes , we have that too . 
  in kaunas region even those simple regional buses with 99 percent of old ladies travelling have wi-fi . 
  their lifestyle , humour and mentality . 
  poland . 
  because i feel so similar to polish people  3 . 
  because braliukas , 
  [ skrabalai ] ( https://youtu.be/jjabtqwacim ) it is  looks quite fun , but this guy in the video is one of the few who can still play them, 
  after football ? 
  yeah , right :d after basketball , maybe ? 
  you either love it or hate it . 
  half of my friends could n't finish it , and the for the other half it 's one of the favourite books . 
  definately [ a guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jonas_ple%c5%a1kys ) who decided to steal soviet submarine and ran away . 
  what an idea . 
  and the film `` the hunt for the red october '' is based on his story . 
  `` in the shadow of the altars '' - my favourite lithuanian book , about a life of a catholic priest , who always questions his mission and falls in love frequently . 
  and it caused quite a scandal when it was written back in 30 's  `` forest of the gods '' is about a nazi concentration camp . 
  written from the author 's perspective and experience there . 
  there is also [ a film ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_of_the_gods ) made based on this book . 
  from the contemporary books i love `` silva rerum '' , which is about a noble lithuanian family in 1600s-1700s . 
  their lives , experiences , historical background is amazing . 
  got it . 
  [ vilnius here ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/11352089_1084214388275152_880452257_n.jpg ) . 
  just living our regular eastern europe life . 
  although it started raining in the weekend , that 's some new information . 
  [ suicide roller coaster !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euthanasia_coaster ) is anyone surprised ? 
  i just recommend looking at [ this page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/onlithuania/photos_stream ) . 
  not all places are natural wonders , but you can find amazing places here . 
  not afraid of this debate as i am * sure * it was lithuania , 
  we love basketball . 
  although it 's very cool to say that you do n't if you 're a hipster . 
  but secretly everyone loves it . 
  oh , and we always tell people that lithuania used to be huuuge . 
  i try not to , but sometimes i start telling people that , just because everyone does :d, 
  `` in the nordic countries ** and ** in estonia '' ouch . 
  not nordic :(, 
  best - it was a very hot summer and a truck with sprinklers drove nearby . 
  i mean , intentionally . 
  i was very thankful  worst - someone stole 1000 korunas . 
  and i was just a teenager , so did n't have more money and could n't buy anything :(, 
  i spend about 5 euros if i go to a restaurant and about 2-3 euros if i go to supermarket . 
  it 's ok i guess . 
  hannibal lecter of course . 
  finding a parking spot - not so much :d candles are beautiful when it 's dark though . 
  lithuania - only in clubs i think . 
  maybe some people organize something , but it 's not a thing . 
  we have a grave visiting day on the 1st of november and it is considered a time of silence , so no tradition of loud parties and fun . 
  aaaad all the pictures on the internet are about trafic jams caused by all people visiting the graves , not about the parties and pumpkins . 
  uk , especially london . 
  italian , french , german . 
  `` god save the queen '' is nice as well , 
  i consider it as a large pool of contained powers , which decided not to fight anymore . 
  so far . 
  [ kaunas coat of arms ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/kns_coa.svg ) i like it , it seems a bit badass :d i do n't know why the bison was chosen , but i think it 's because it was associated with strength and power of nature . 
  i remember the huge monument of the animal in one of the parks in kaunas , it seemed so huge when i was little , impressive , 
  yes , with the slightly bigger population we feel the same . 
  i like to say that we are `` limited edition '' in the world :d, 
  first country to leave soviet union . 
  we can be brave when we want , 
  i think every town in lithuania has `` vytauto '' , `` gedimino '' , `` k\u0119stu\u010dio '' streets ( of our grand dukes ) . 
  and streets of city names are also popular - e.g. 
  well , what i 've heard from my non-lithuanian friends - it 's '' - as '' . 
  camembert , mozzarella and gorgonzola are number ones for me and i eat them on daily basis . 
  lithuanian cheese is great , by the way . 
  we have wonderful [ white curd cheese ] ( http://lsveikata.lt/upload/articles_images/3185/def/suris.jpg ) ( i recommend to eat it with honey , it 's really good ) , [ dessert cheese ] ( http://www.anglija.today/uploads/thumbs/680x382/54d2cfc0bbbfdf9810d5707145ddb3aa.jpg ) , as well as variety of dried and smoked cheese . 
  and [ `` liliputas '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/s%c5%abris_liliputas.jpg ) - best of the best , in my opinion . 
  fermented cheese . 
  i tried lots of other fermented cheese , never found anything as tasty as `` liliputas '' . 
  and `` vilkt '' is `` pull '' :d i 'm always laughing about `` gr\u016bst '' and `` vilkt '' whenever i 'm in latvia, 
  cauliflower intensifies ... 
  i do n't know anyone who does his/her hair himself/herself . 
  that is a strange assumption . 
  even when we ( me and my friends ) were students and had no money , we still went to hair salons as they are not considered some kind of luxury thing here . 
  usually that `` i do n't want to look like i come from the post-soviet country '' frightened look on the face and the outfits that give out that one is from the post-soviet country anyway . 
  but that is for 50 + age group . 
  people that are younger than 40-50 years old look pretty normal for me .
