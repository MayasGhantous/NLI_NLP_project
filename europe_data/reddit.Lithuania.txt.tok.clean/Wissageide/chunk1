dude . 
  you failed to mention that all comments in lithuanian mass media are worse than youtube + / pol / . 
  anyone who reads those and expects a reasonable discussion is just delusional . 
  it seems like they consist solely of low iq individuals , latvi\u0173 street employees and / or bored trolls . 
  why not both ? 
  how unfortunate for him / s, 
  atleast rutracker will probably stay forever . 
  well , maybe you 're right . 
  in lithuania we use our version ( karaliau\u010dius ) all the time too . 
  because it would be the same as calling kionigsberg twankste a hundred years ago . 
  it 's just not the same place . 
  maybe they were from central asia ( kazakhstan , etc. 
  very resolution , such a glorious flag placement, 
  have you ever been to poland ? 
  why not both ? 
  are they undercover pagan balts ? 
  just seen another account suspended . 
  this time it was / rusembassynot  edit : damn , / sovietsergey ( lavrov ) was also suspended recently . 
  what a shame, 
  yeah ? 
  no , dude , the whole of us does not live in iraq . 
  the u.k. really does stand out, 
  this submission seems to be rapidly downvoted into oblivion . 
  edit : or at least it fluctuates between 2 to 5 upvotes every five seconds . 
  i was away from reddit for about a year but i do n't think this is very common . 
  because ethnic cleansing . 
  the first one is not a village . 
  at the time of construction that was really the suburb of vilnius - \u017dv\u0117rynas . 
  '' \u017dv\u0117rynas ( literally the menagerie ) '' as told by wikipedia was hunting grounds for radvila/radziwi \u0142\u0142 family .

  so why do n't use german names in konigsberg ? 
  apparently gervyaty is a lithuanian town . 
  well more like it was not so long ago , but not really anymore as in 1996 only 1/3 were lithuanian and the number in the whole region is decreasing rapidly . 
  i am happy and sad at the same time as that church is really awesome . 
  sorry for being late to the thread . 
  highly improbable . 
  russian is still quite a common language ( more common than german ) and there is really no negative association with the language itself . 
  it 's all dead now . 
  but what you said just reinforces my point : it diverged recently enough , if even classic ( 19th-18th century ? ), 
  slavic literature helps with mutual intelligibility . 
  it means the language was even closer 1000 years ago . 
   i can easily understand like 80-90 % of written polish damn . 
  i can understand only about 50-40 % of written latvian and about 5-0 % when spoken ... 
  it kinda amazes me , how relatively young are slavic languages . 
  this castle is not in poland or kaliningrad . 
  it 's really in france . 
  their gdp was n't that much stronger even without the sanctions . 
  thank you . 
  could somebody tell what car is in 11 picture ? 
  you must be really fun at parties . 
  you know , it makes you sound like a retard too when you assume that i read , or take seriously delfi articles on russia . 
  when you attack me and imply i 'm * `` i 'm mad at russia therefore everyone has to be mad at them '' * over a sarcastic joke based on land and nation gobbling country that makes you sound like a very insecure retard . 
  and finally , the tv , radio channels and schools ( and even official languages ) does n't mean that russia is friendly or accommodating to minorities . 
  it only means that russia is living in the 21st century . 
  but at the end of the day , these nations are forbidden from going their own way . 
  oh , i must confess i do not have any solid arguments at hand and am too lazy to look them up . 
  although if it looks like a duck , swims like a duck , and quacks like a duck , then it probably is a duck . 
  i remember seeing something about russian majority elected governor suppressing the culture of chuvash or bashkirs , but again , i care too little and am too lazy to look it up . 
  sorry if i inflamed your enthusiasm for discussion . 
  that was n't my intention . 
  i 'm not particularly mad at russia , i just wanted to make a point that russian state is not very accommodating to it 's minorities ( of any kind ) . 
  a big friendly brotherhood and a real human bean . 
  190 is n't enough so they 'll adopt more and spread the great message of multiculti . 
  excludes : [ 160,000 , or about 7 % of the total population . 
  at the beginning of the war , some 12,000 jewish refugees fled into lithuania from poland ; by 1941 the jewish population of lithuania had swelled to approximately 250,000 , or 10 % of the total population . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_jews#lithuanian_jews_in_the_second_world_war ) * * because of vilnius, 
  maybe he meant writing systems . 
  it 's some kind of a moderately light bulb . 
  hmm , interesting . 
  i am now curious about the common origins of post soviet store planning . 
  as i 've written before , in general i agree that saying `` lithuania has nothing in common with russia '' is untrue . 
  however i believe that saying `` both lithuania and russia have more in common with soviet union than with each other '' would be closer to the truth . 
  of course , the modern russian state is the legal heir of su which russia dominated , but our nations chose very different paths ~ ~ in modern times ~ ~ everytime the choice came up ( unless it was forced ) . 
  we have very different identity ( despite * some * russophilic tendencies ) and we like to highlight that . 
   slavic and baltic languages are often unified into the same group i believe that 's untrue . 
  more closely unified in * origins * than other indo-european languages , but not unified into the same group . 
  baltic is simply different : conservative and very stable geographically for a long time versus relatively young and very expansive slavic . 
  it is hypothesized they were separate for at least a millennia before they again came in contact when slavic speaking people expanded into what nowadays is belarus and russia . 
  tl ; dr - in general , i agree . 
  while i completely disagree with a / u/pm _ me_your_ladyboys view , i can not agree with you too . 
   share russian kaliningrad and belarus well the one thing that i 'm quite sure about most lithuanians , is that we do not think of kaliningrad as really `` russian '' . 
  sure , it 's great past now lays in ruins and commieblocks grow like a forest in a swamp of bad roads , but it 's still * feels * like pr\u016bsija . 
  both baltic and germanic past of karaliau\u010dius ( like we still officially call it ) is very closely intertwined with the modern day lithuania . 
  it was the lighthouse of lithuanian culture for centuries . 
  it is called ** little lithuania ** to this day belarus is really similar to russia * on the east * , but * on the west * it is very similar to lithuania , the old , peasant lithuania in contrast with kalliningrad . 
  granted the similarities are dying a slow and painful death under pseudo-sovietic regime of lukashenka as well as because the border . 
   `` domofonas '' never heard in my entire life . 
  it even sounds vulgarly slavic . 
  but probably some city has this slang in their vocabulary . 
  everyone i know just used `` telefonas '' or if needed to differentiate `` nam\u0173 telefonas '' . 
   lithuanian shops are arranged the same way as russian ones never been to a russian one , could n't tell . 
  but i have a suspicion , you are talking about the small , village shops  russian pop music is relatively popular in lithuania in * some circles * , yes . 
  to elitists from the capital like me it feels very un-intellectual , vulgar and self degrading . 
  but hey , there are idiots and chavs ( or marozai ) in every country . 
   there is plenty of young people who look like marozai aka gopniks most of them are uneducated , ignorant and poor . 
  and yes , they are very russophillic indeed . 
  lithuania in general was and i guess still is the most rusophillic of baltics , you still can find that in all social groups . 
  my dad , for example , enjoys russian comedy and films very much , although when talking about russia the country he is borderline racist . 
   balto-slavic baltic languages may be significantly closer to slavic than germanic , but i 'm not sure why that 's supposedly makes us more russian and not polish for example  estonians as i said , lithuanians are quite russophillic because there was n't any colonisation like in latvia and estonia . 
  plus estonians in the soviet times had access to finnish ( free and western ) culture .
