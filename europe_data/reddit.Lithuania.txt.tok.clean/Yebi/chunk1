either that 's wrong , or a very old version of the word, 
  not sure if joking or retarded, 
  also , what 's the point ? 
  if i want to watch it on a screen , i 'll stay home and do that . 
  now * that * is cherry picking, 
  germany , france , latvia and croatia . 
  every group plays in a different country . 
  the final phase will be played in france iirc, 
  24 mods . 
  i had a quick look at subs of various sizes ( from 35k subs to defaults ) that i 'm subscribed to . 
  all of them have significantly less ( some of them several orders of magnitude less ) mods per capita than / r/anarchism mfw, 
  ummm no . 
  `` b\u0117glys '' means fugitive . 
  you 're kinda proving my point here . 
  similar things happen to us all the time . 
  the commonwealth gets called `` poland , '' lithuanian dukes get called russian , the nation gets labelled as slavs , etc. 
  and guess what ? 
  polite corrections aside , nobody gives a fuck . 
  there 's no need to explain , we all understand what 's going on . 
  stealing of history , fake ancient greek monuments , incorrect history textbooks , etc. 
  what greece is doing is still some petty bullshit . 
  you should be the bigger man ( for lack of a better idiom ) in this situation instead of throwing tantrums . 
  pro life tip : never attribute to malice what could be just as easily explained by stupidity or incompetence, 
  i guess that must be very offensive to the people of former turkish republic of greece, 
   senaties terminas statute of limitations, 
  greece would like a word, 
  how is that relevant ? 
  or at least ours . 
  here 's the thing ... 
  lol , thats gay , amirite ? 
  the colour-coding of this map is a load of bullshit . 
  i mean c'mon , the difference between 73 and 72,5 is made to seem larger than between 73 and 83 . 
  move along , no propaganda here . 
  wikipedia can be very useful if you know what you 're doing . 
  i mostly use it to get a broad understanding of what it is i 'm about to study before diving into the textbooks . 
  also , reading the scientific papers that wiki cites often gives you some nice info . 
  where 's the fallacy ? 
  ummm ... no . 
  i am very well aware of the existance of other regions , but naming your product `` nepal '' or `` argentina '' would not send the same kind of message as naming it `` europe '' or `` america . '', 
  and before you say anything , no , i do n't think europe or america are `` cooler '' than nepal or argentina , i just believe that whoever named that gum thinks so . 
  their insurance company probably said `` fuck no '' to naming it `` america '', 
  i literally ca n't remember the last time it rained, 
  i have no clue where you 'd get the translations , but here goes : [ popiet\u0117 su algimantu \u010cekuoliu ] ( http://www.lrt.lt/mediateka/irasas/79653/popiete_su_a._cekuoliu ) ( afternoon with algimantas \u010cekuolis ) - a really smart old dude just talks at a camera for a while . 
  topics vary - international politics , sciene , culture , etc. 
  sounds boring , but he makes it interesting by knowing what he 's talking about and knowing how to talk . 
  for the children 's category - [ gustavo enciklopedija ] ( http://www.lrt.lt/mediateka/irasas/78166/gustavo_enciklopedija ) . 
  it 's actually mostly an educational show ( history , science , biology , etc. ), 
  with a little fairy tale material thrown in , but it 's really successful in making the info interesting to kids . 
  you could get drunk by drinking their blood, 
  three reasons : 1 ) so the driver knows you have a ticket 2 ) if you do n't ride often , there 's no sense in buying a month 's ticket , because buying individual tickets would be cheaper . 
  for those people there 's an option to `` fill-up '' your e-ticket with cash instead of tickets , which you use to buy an individual ticket by swiping it in the bus 3 ) that 's how they count how many people are riding on a particular bus . 
  they adjust timetables and add/remove buses to/from a particular route based on this data, 
  `` all these conditions '' happen all the time , at least where i come from  regarding the doors , all of them are used . 
  people enter through the front door , and exit through the other 2 , at the same time . 
  in certain situations ( mostly city center stops where lots of people enter and exit ) this directional movement is actually faster . 
  of course , this means that some people slip in the back door and ride without a ticket , but the losses from that are tiny compared to paying several hundred salaries for ticket sellers . 
  seriously , 2 minutes per stop for selling tickets ? 
  in most stops ( and during peak times - practically all stops ) it takes literally no time at all , because people just swipe their e-ticket while walking past the driver without stopping . 
  on the rare occasions when somebody actually needs to buy one , it takes maybe 15 seconds . 
  yup, 
  bullshit jobs that do n't really add anything to the economy is an old russian tradition . 
  a good example : every city bus and tram has an employee ( in addition to the driver ) that sells/checks the tickets . 
  it would be pretty hard to think of a less efficient system , but hey , low unemployment . 
  hm ... maybe i 'm wrong , but i figured this use is very close to `` x assumed the position '', 
  it should . 
  this is just using a less common definition of `` assumption , '' but definitely not a mistake or even a very rare use of the word . 
   kaunas to warsaw is a bit of a question mark right now , it will definitely be there , but the speed and infrastructure is being discussed there 's not much to discuss , since they 're pretty much done building it, 
   one article i read about the place said that one prisoner has all his mail screened and is only allowed 2 15 minute phone calls to his family each month . 
  if anyone is interested , [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3gffnq/irish_high_court_refuses_to_extradite_suspect_to/ ) the article, 
  yeah , like mtgox, 
  in smaller towns they tend to just ask their teachers what languages can they speak , and then teach whatever they can . 
  100 % of our kings got murdered though, 
  can not into statistics, 
  poland is definitely communicating poland war nothing gay , fact really different ukraine bad language guy always comment enough, 
  volleyball players - hell yeah swimmers look like men, 
  why is this in dollars ? 
  you missed my point completely, 
  what about a person who is well-read on the topic of crystal energy ? 
  not all books are worthy or true , and unfortunately , `` well-read '' is often a synonym for `` brainwashed . '', 
  what about the chairs ? 
  he did n't do anything . 
  his biggest economical achievement is coming into power around the same time when oil prices suddenly skyrocketed for unrelated reasons . 
  yeltsin could n't have done any worse than putin did even if he tried . 
  actually , estonia is on their list too , as well as 3 other places . 
  also , their headline has nothing to do with us . 
  10 $ says op is lithuanian, 
  we switched over to nato caliber weapons not that long ago , the old ones are probably still lying around being useless . 
  you would n't be happy if a decision to freeze 50 billion usd of swedish assets was reverted ? 
  well that 's retarded . 
  if you 're gon na immediately back down after putin says something , do n't bother at all . 
  yeah , the situation in greece may be bad , but at least there 's no alien invasion, 
  i 'd lose the damn count after 3 ... 
   this is so painfully simple , and yet industry seems too slow to learn this . 
  so true . 
  torrenting is still literally the only way i can access most shows and movies out there . 
  occam 's razor would suggest they 're just doing because it makes usa look bad . 
  also , that the idea of snowden being a russian agent was probably made up by american intelligence . 
  hell , i would consider them idiots if they did n't try to push that . 
  makes both snowden and the russians look like bad guys , two birds with one stone .
