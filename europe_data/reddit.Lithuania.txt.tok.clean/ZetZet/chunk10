  we can classify him as lithuanian because he was ruling lithuania until he died , if he decided to not be lithu language really does n't matter in this case . 
  lithuanian language was n't even written until after they all died , would be hard to communicate for a ruler i would think . 
  lithuania did n't take it . 
  i do n't know why you keep saying that . 
  russians took it and decided to give it back to lithuania . 
   firstly at this time jagie\u0142\u0142o was a king of poland and he was born in today 's belarus . 
  for a person which there is no historical evidence he even spoke lithuanian claiming him lithuanian is a huge understatement . 
  as the stating he maybe son of a father that there is literally nearly 0 historical informations . 
  he was the fucking son of the fucking grand duke of lithuania ... is that not enough ? 
  are we ignoring lineage now ? 
  capital of lithuania was kaunas for good 20 years after the 1st world war when polish took vilnius . 
  yes . 
   wilno was developed by the polish settlers and so the whole region around it . 
  this is obviously known , but with their money rich polish settlers carried their culture and their language . 
  lithuanians were learning polish instead of lithuanian to get that money . 
  assimilation did n't just happen in the upper class . 
  it happened in every class . 
   it was only sybolic capital , never was real capital . 
  for centuries associated with polish culture . 
  that 's completely bs , just because during the commonwealth lithuanian rich started to associate themselves with polish culture since lithuanian culture was seen as low class does n't make vilnius not a real capital of lithuania . 
  the city was literally built to be a capital of lithuania . 
  also the statistics of poles living in the region are heavily tainted by polonization of the working class . 
  could n't read that far because the overall tone was crying, 
  2 years in prison and you 're crying already ? 
  that 's like a vacation, 
  netherlands are crowded ... 
  growth is growth , we do n't need it anywhere . 
  stable very slow decline is good overall . 
  sure . 
  we really need 10 billion people on earth . 
  oh please , with summers we are having lately i wish my phone cooled instead, 
  what are you noping at . 
  russian food is okay , it 's not fancy , for obvious reasons , but it 's okay . 
  i do n't know about that , baltics would probably be nicer if they decide to do some training . 
  basically a vacation in the summer . 
  i doubt that dual citizenship will bring in more people . 
  tax could always be reduced , but it 's still low compared to the west . 
  yes , but can you point out where the politicians are failing ? 
  what can be changed ? 
   wtf is wrong with the south of spain / facepalm why work , you do n't need to pay for heating , can catch fish with bare hands , cook it on hot rock . 
  amiright ? 
  does n't work like that . 
  the red part will die out . 
  everyone does n't make it to pension age . 
  not to mention pension ages are already very high and just keep increasing . 
  that 's ppp , does n't really reflect the difference between latvia and the west if you look it that way . 
  semantics matter since latvia is n't doing poorly . 
  it 's improving every year since it left ussr . 
  ( ignoring the 2008 bullshit ), 
  i actually noticed many people are already returning from uk . 
  seasonal jobs are still gold mines , but living and working there does n't give you better quality of life since you pay more for housing and other things while working a low end job . 
   gdp per capita is higher for russia and romania is extremely close . 
  since when ? 
  it 's probably 2016-04-30 23:59, 
  the situation is n't dire . 
  latvia still lives better than both russia and romania and keeps improving . 
  take what action ? 
  increase minimum salary to insane amounts ? 
  politicians have nothing to do with this . 
  people leave for economic reasons . 
  well it 's obvious some people are going to leave . 
  that 's natural once the border is n't slammed shut . 
  also predicting 50 years in the future is just retarded , especially since their economy is improving faster than that . 
  well it was happening inside too . 
  that 's why we got this change . 
  data roaming prices are probably the most retarded thing ever . 
  eu has no control of outside the eu . 
  yeah , if we get it it 's never too late . 
  this change will be awesome for my dad who drives to estonia on a regular basis . 
  next year it 's ** gone . 
  ** this is the last step . 
  soon i will be able to watch youtube on a beach in latvia ... 
  soon ... 
  power plant does n't explode like a bomb . 
  well they have n't given up on those regions yet . 
  need a confirmed source first, 
  letts, 
  oh i have no problems with soyuz , it 's a good , efficient rocket , but it 's old and it 's not some magic tech like the person i responded to seems to think . 
  my only problem with soyuz is that we did n't spend more money to develop falcon type rockets faster . 
  stuck to old tech too long imo . 
  woah you made lithuania the smallest baltic country . 
  soyuz got updated i guess . 
  moon does ? 
  right ? 
  exhaust looks different because the engines are spread out . 
  [ there is n't less smoke though .

  i 'm pretty sure it 's in a class of it 's own since it lands . 
  [ i rechecked , first thing i saw lied to me . 
  ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/washingtonpost/2011/07/03/health-environment-science/graphics/shuttle-graphicstory2.jpg ), 
  that might be because falcon 9 has ~ ~ 3 ~ ~ 2 times the payload ? 
  ( and it lands ) [ i mean falcon 9 looks pretty insane too , that 50m long tail of fire .

  russian scientists have always tried to dodge politics and just did work . 
  russian politics however ... 
  reddit has rules for sarcasm because of stupid people , i choose to not look for sarcasm . 
  if you go to the source linked in the comments they are in eurasia , pretty bad scoring , terrible really . 
  they could 've added russia , but it probably broke the scale, 
  what do you mean it 's a lie . 
  is this normal ?
