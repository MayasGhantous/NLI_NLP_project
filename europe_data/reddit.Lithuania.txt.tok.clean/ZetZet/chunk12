  there is no benefit in using wood . 
  it will break , discolour , is heavier . 
  sounds like the mic is in the nest itself ? 
   rather wish all the various middle eastern religions stayed where they started . 
  what do you mean ? 
  in this case christianity is not reliable either . 
  ca n't really convince people their beliefs are wrong when you believe in the same thing . 
  struggling for money , still smokes cigarettes \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  oh , they still have them . 
  gulag, 
  insults are n't illegal here , but it 's a balacing act between insult and harassment do n't you think ? 
  you can . 
  just do n't say that you will kill them because of it . 
  gulag , just kidding , or am i. russia still had political prisoners until very recently . 
  uhh ... 
  it 's not anti-free speech , it 's anti-harassment , you can say whatever the fuck you want until you start attacking someone personally . 
  for example recently ~ ~ director ~ ~ principal of one school in lithuania got a couple years in prison because he started attacking a student after he caught her smoking and kicked her out of school . 
  he was talking some serious shit like she wo n't have a future and stuff , he promised to personally destroy her life . 
  it was bad . 
  of course those prison years do n't have to be served unless he does something else during that period , on probation . 
   fourthly , they have to build a wall . 
  russians are skilled in building mountains out of people , [ wall is n't going to stop them ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/6q6ijkai15mba/giphy.gif ), 
  actually no . 
  restaurant is a generic place where you eat title . 
  if mcdonald 's did n't have any tables and only sold take-out then you could call it a shop . 
  what do you mean below normal rents . 
  you basically ca n't get anything for 508 ? 
  or is everyone renting at exactly that now ? 
  i prefer hesburger ... 
  i do n't see how this is any worse than some used clothes 1 euro store . 
  at least they refurbished the building and it 's not falling apart . 
  you should ask them to change the m colour to something that suits the building and it would be fine . 
  [ it 's surprising to me that this snack is n't popular in other countries , good way to get rid of older bread .

  do n't forget to order fried bread with beer if you go . 
  better than chips , 
  commonwealth was not a single country . 
  partitions was the collapse . 
  not to mention the town existed even before commonwealth . 
  extra draught is the `` live '' one . 
  but yeah . 
  traditional beers do not get exported over seas . 
  woah, 
  you can find big brewery lithuanian beer in the us . 
   ( you can call 10:00 iki 20:00 o'clock every day ) lmao, 
  it should n't be . 
  it 's in lithuania , never was poland . 
  just because you call it that in polish does n't mean we should too . 
  this joke does n't work when you try to apply it in regions that were never polish . 
  shopping on sunday is relaxing too because most people already went on friday and saturday . 
  shops are pretty empty , it 's nice . 
  that 's correct . 
  rich people have time to go to gyms and hire diet specialists , eat at restaurants , they are also less depressed . 
  middle class tends to get fat because they are run down from work , no time to go to gyms , they eat at home oversized portions because they can afford to , also they eat in bad intervals , many people who works all day only get good breakfast in and then huge meal late at night . 
  any church is a nightmare to me personally . 
  type does n't really add much . 
  sweet, 
  lithuania is [ \u0160v\u0117k\u0161na ] ( https://www.google.lt/search?q=%c5%a1veksna&amp;biw=1836&amp;bih=995&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi89-2orobmahwbcpokhsfibjuq_auibiga&amp;dpr=1#q=%c5%a1v%c4%97ksna ) , it 's not a village by our definition , a small town . 
  yeah well , and yet when you stand on the ground it looks pretty big and very flat . 
  that 's perspective for you . 
  no they just are more tired of it . 
  yeah , she is asking to be stoned, 
  it 's a penis measuring contest at this point . 
  you are n't allowed to vote . 
  / s happy reddit day . 
  yeah , lithuanian rap/hip-hop is actually quite good , much better than what the current `` stars '' put out . 
  it 's pretty clear on youtube views too , the only lithuanian artists that rival rap/hip-hop on youtube views are leon somov & jazzu and sel [ ( i do n't get new sel songs , but he is popular ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhqs0gs4pfk&amp;nohtml5=false ), 
  it 's about people leaving lithuania for money . 
  song name translates to `` for the paper '' . 
  well running a business is a different thing . 
  why not go for the classic ? 
  yeah that one makes no sense either . 
  why do n't you just write it with \u0117 or \u0119 then ? 
  apparently it makes no sense to everyone http://mokslasplius.lt/mokslo-lietuva/2006-2011/node/2974.html, 
  lazy ? 
  i hate when they make up new words instead of using the existing english ones . 
  smoothie - glotnutis ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  no he is not saying he is lazy . 
  he clearly stated that in us people hire other people to do their taxes for them , now that 's fucked up . 
  it 's dying out slowly because the language preservation in lithuania is aggressive . 
  going for miss lithuania 2007 straight up . 
  solid goals . 
  yeah , but it 's really hard to understand for lithuanians too . 
  i would n't bother . 
  latvians like dashes , we like dots . 
  [ you can probably read it though . 
  rap itself is pretty bad . 
  but the idea is nice . 
  [ exterminate ] ( https://d30y9cdsu7xlg0.cloudfront.net/png/4078-200.png ), 
  such is life, 
  mainly because it 's made with liqueur . 
  it 's terrible though , the glaze is more plastic than chocolate . 
  i think personal houses had to remove them faster , industrial got more time because warehouses and stuff . 
  at least that 's how it was in lithuania . 
  learning the language is n't a requirement before arrival , but trying to after seems like it would be a decent thing to ask . 
  leaving islam is not required , but just keep it to yourself , like everyone else keeps what they believe to themselves . 
  ca n't compare usa prices to uk ones , usa has no vat . 
  region locks are disgusting .
