  it 's like drugs . 
  yes . 
  they need big foreign companies to invest first or else there will be nothing to tax at all . 
  that 's why they are low . 
  we want business to pls come . 
  lidl came . 
  real cheese can be without lactose too . 
  problem is cheese product , at least the consumer versions split when heated up . 
  and their mozzarella impersonations are the worst . 
  fermented cheese copy is hard to separate . 
  only real way to tell is let it heat up to room temp and it becomes sticky a f. 
  yeah they know because they were literally there . 
   ** during a stake-out ** of the home on rue quatre-vents , police came increasingly convinced that residents were hiding a larger group of people there . 
  tuna pizza is delicious . 
  they contain cheese product . 
  if you ca n't tell a difference where is the harm ? 
  that 's the initiation sacrifice . 
  ppp stands for purchasing power parity, 
  nice cover . 
  well you can just tell estonia is fake , nobody is that perfect, 
  well that 's just sad , i do n't understand what your point is . 
  coal is terrible even if it 's better economically . 
  it does . 
  poland is choking on their own coal . 
  it 's the investment thing again , a balancing act . 
  they did n't . 
  this is quite recent . 
  it 's cheap enough . 
  electricity price is among the lowest . 
  investment into building one is large , that 's for sure . 
  why poland is choking on coal http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/07/poland-krakow-ban-coal-use-anti-smog-law, 
  when you are competing with coal life is hard . 
  i would pay ten times more for electricity to not have chinese quality air in europe . 
  or we could do methane capture and burn it !, 
  yes . 
  neither does the graph you showed . 
  those are market prices . 
  most people including me would n't care about that . 
  you ca n't take away my sausages . 
   i do n't even know how one person could come up with so much bullshit . 
  yes , exactly thanks for finding sources . 
  10 years to pay off and they are selling electricity for ** more ** than market price to the government . 
  at least in europe . 
   that has rather changed quite significantly . 
  it definitely has , still not enough . 
   they 're close enough . 
  wait are you telling me you can produce in germany at the same costs as in china ? 
  solar panels are extremely expensive even when made in china . 
  so expensive they are in no way cost effective . 
  the only reason people even buy them in the current market is because of financial eu support and then they get to sell the electricity for fifty times normal price as `` green '' . 
  and even when doing so it takes like 10 years for it to pay for itself . 
  moving industry away from china wo n't make them more efficient . 
  costs will be even more through the roof , when even now they are extremely high . 
  in the current economy nuclear is by far the best power source we have . 
  so it is . 
  hydro is not emitting anything , but hydro is terrible for the environment also very situational . 
  everything else needs storage , which makes everything else terrible . 
  nuclear is by far the lowest on co2 emissions . 
  it leaves waste , which is not a big deal and the amount of waste is not very large . 
  not to mention there are ways to dispose of it , just no one is investing into it because it 's not cost efficient . 
  but they are the greenest . 
  lowest co2 emissions , least amount of waste , least amount of transportation in production . 
  huge power output and great reliability . 
  waste problem is not a problem . 
  it 's a `` problem '' . 
  to anyone who has done any research about nuclear power it 's as much of a problem as picking which cereal to eat in the morning . 
  nuclear is not cheap , but it 's the cheapest . 
  strange . 
  solar has carbon emissions that are n't that low . 
  wind is unreliable as all hell . 
  both of those methods need energy storage , storage is extremely damaging to the environment . 
  that 's not how it works , you need to reduce everything , not just one thing . 
  no way meat is 2 times more expensive . 
  even with less vat . 
  it 's 30 % at best . 
  my grandfathers live near border and they do n't even bother going . 
  you need to buy way too much stuff for it to be worth fuel . 
  i agree on that . 
  polish products are indeed cheaper , but i still prefer lithuanian stuff because of quality . 
  but i do n't care about meat . 
  cheese , butter , yogurt are places that i actually notice a difference . 
  meat not so much . 
  but those murders are n't justified in any way in our culture . 
  in theirs it seems like they are trying to justify those actions . 
  if you read further than just the name of the country you will see that most if not all of those incidents in first world countries are related to middle eastern/african/asian ethnic groups . 
  the past does n't matter in this case , it 's not justification . 
  not just , but mostly . 
  education is related to religion . 
  it 's a form of education whether you like it or not . 
  every year in the united kingdom ( uk ) , officials estimate that at least a dozen women are victims of honor killings , almost exclusively within asian and middle eastern families . 
  france has a large immigrant community from north africa ( especially from algeria , morocco and tunisia ) and honor violence occurs in this community . 
  does everywhere count in this case ? 
  i agree , however honor killings are something that just does n't happen in our culture . 
  it does n't seem that way in theirs . 
  is killing above or below the line . 
  i am so confused now . 
  i think killing people is where i draw the line between better/worse . 
  but that 's just me . 
  people can have different opinions . 
  nice culture you have there,
