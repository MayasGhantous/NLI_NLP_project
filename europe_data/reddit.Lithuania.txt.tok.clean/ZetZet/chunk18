  or gnostic atheist ( you are sure there is no god , idk what evidence you might have in your mind ) . 
  you can also be agnostic theist ( no evidence , but still believe ) , or gnostic theist ( derp ) also religion is a system of beliefs . 
  atheism is not believing in religions , gods or deities that humanity has imagined . 
  atheism is a religion like off is a tv channel . 
  islam is not even close to fastest growing . 
  check the sources they are all muslim or from 1900s . 
  but you paid 50 not 10 .

  100m waterproof . 
  13 bucks . 
  and casio is still casio . 
  you can buy a casio watch for 10 bucks and it will last you two decades . 
  that 's luxuries , not necessities . 
  i wonder how long has that stick been there . 
  someone probably has to replace the stick sometimes , no way it lasts during winter . 
  yeah , we would never move that stick on the beach . 
  too much work . 
  that is how it has always been . 
  the difference is back in the day poor people had to buy 1 pair of boots for 250 and wear them forever to not run out of money . 
  now they can buy 5 shittier pairs that will last less , but at least they wo n't be worn out all the time . 
  cheap food is not the problem really , with food preparation is key , price not so much . 
  poor people just work too long and do n't have the will and time to make healthy food for cheaper and they have to buy pre-made cheap meals and that 's a problem . 
  it 's still not aldi problem . 
  the farming industry is just too divided to work efficiently so their costs ca n't go down as low . 
  it 's like comparing clothes made in a factory of 1000 workers and a custom shop that has 5 workers , you just ca n't produce at the same price . 
  exactly what you said , just different meaning . 
  ** many ** of them are slowly going bankrupt . 
  many except the large farms and co-ops . 
  once again i will repeat myself . 
  it 's not aldi problem , it 's not government problem . 
  it 's industry problem . 
  in every industry large corporations and cooperatives took over because they have the power to negotiate big contracts and deals except farming . 
  farmers are still divided having two cows and two acres of land trying to compete with huge farms . 
  huge farms can produce at lower costs , many small farmers are going to go bankrupt . 
  because quotas that have been keeping them alive have been removed . 
  they had many years to switch their business or form cooperatives . 
  they did n't . 
  they will die out . 
  stuff grows just fine during summer , just it is n't that long . 
  what do they want again, 
  in lithuania companies are allowed to pay 0 for interns and people still do it , for experience . 
  it 's not for long though . 
  not to mention those who live with 100 eur a month do n't work or have never worked a day in their life and get minimum pension possible . 
  so i do n't see the reason to feel sorry for them . 
  i refuse to believe that you ca n't get any job even for minimum wage if you try even a little bit . 
  four exams ? 
  danger to society, 
  * densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories , sharing industry , infrastructure , and housing . 
  hey , at least they got the skin colour right on the refurbished one . 
  i do n't mind it either . 
  yeah well , industry . 
  consuming honey does n't kill bees . 
  cow eats grass , we ca n't eat grass and we do n't cultivate grass , we do n't spray grass , we do n't need to genetically modify grass , so it does n't cause that much harm since it just grows on it 's own anyway . 
  the plants we eat ourselves we need to cultivate , watch , spray , eradicate other plants in the area so they do n't compete for resources . 
  farming causes the most harm since it 's the least natural way to live , it 's the last thing humans did after coming out of the jungle . 
  plant spraying kills bees . 
  fish do n't have a complex nervous system . 
  can we eat fish ? 
  the origin of diseases pretty much always comes from wildlife . 
  and industrial livestock is n't pumped full with antibiotics . 
  it 's actually regulated amounts and i 'm not sure about eggs , but milk cows ca n't take any antibiotics if they want to give milk . 
  what about vegans , they kill bees , they also eat everything while it 's still alive . 
  have you ever heard about a vegan that eats dead plants ? 
  it looks very new . 
  tree still has the tag . 
  i wonder how it looks after a couple years of bird poop everywhere . 
  yes bears definitely consider . 
  since they do n't kill everything they see . 
  they only kill things they plan to eat . 
  16,67 eur via ups from caseking up to 30kg . 
  but i do n't really order there . 
  our local skytech.lt is on point . 
  https://www.caseking.de/ for pc parts . 
  2015 as a whole was a mess i do n't think it 's a good idea to look at these statistics . 
  baltics got hit by russian sanctions , but still managed to pull through for the most part . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's industry problem . 
  big farms and cooperatives have no problems producing at low prices since they can get away by getting huge contracts and selling bulk . 
  small farmers start dying . 
  this happened everywhere clothing , metal working , woodworking , farming is just the last one to fall . 
  i wouldnt . 
  if i wanted a specific doctor from a private clinic i would go to that private clinic . 
  you can still be dutch just like americans can be texan or alaskan . 
  [ i 'm ready .

  it 's still not what pays their bills . 
  their main income is their salary , which is n't low . 
  people are idiots ? 
  breaking news . 
  no it is n't . 
  truck drivers earn above average salary , road workers earn above average salary , construction workers , carpenters . 
  physical work with no skills is paid like shit . 
  ** skilled workers ** earn good money . 
  skilled physical workers also earn good money . 
  free market might have a problem with it though . 
  but since you are german ... too soon ? 
  that 's because they work in different spheres . 
  it 's not unbalanced . 
  of those 78 % women who study medicine not many will become surgeons and hospital administrators . 
  some will , but that will be mostly men .
