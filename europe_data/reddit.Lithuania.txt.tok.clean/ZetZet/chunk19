  same in other spheres of work , there are way more men engineers and hard workers , that 's what pays . 
  women work less hours and do less physical work . 
  does n't mean they ca n't do work that pays , some do . 
  bribes are n't required for anything anymore . 
  only old people think they are . 
  i have been to a hospital many times and never gave a single bribe , was n't treated at all worse . 
  pay-in-envelope does n't happen as often anymore , only in tiny businesses . 
  then what is ? 
  too lazy . 
  medicine is a grind . 
  it definitely does in the summer . 
  which is not very long ... 
  what is selfa, 
  yeah , we have better beer too . 
  i just do n't buy them . 
  why torture myself . 
  selga is so much better . 
  they check that the ticket is yours , that 's not border control . 
  gaidelis is the worst possible cookie to eat alone . 
  it 's only okay when used in cakes with a ton of cream to mask the terrible taste . 
  and even then we now have latvian selga to save us from it . 
  you can drive to baltics take a ferry to finland and drive back to lisbon over the bridge , people with caravans do that . 
  yes , that 's what i meant . 
  so if there is passport control it 's most likely done in the country you leave from . 
  there are n't when you land, 
  why would you ? 
  you do n't have to go through passport controls when you land in schengen country with a plane , just walk through the gate which says eu citizens . 
  just have your passport if someone wants to check . 
  putin is the weak voice in russia ? 
  pretty sure he is calling the shots . 
  ( which are n't very liberal ), 
  making movies is very expensive and requires talent . 
  usa speaks one language and has 360mill population ( plus canada ) and shitloads of money . 
  no country in eu can compete . 
  does n't mean eu does n't make movies , but also it means that european directors and writers could just make their movies in hollywood because of that deep talent pool and network all set up . 
  harry potter is british-american production , pretty big . 
  same, 
  police actually makes it on the most trusted establishments lists now . 
  http://www.ve.lt/naujienos/lietuva/lietuvos-naujienos/labiausiai-pasitikima-policija-ir-ugniagesiais-1440170/ big change over the last decade ( 35 % at 2009 , 60 + 2016 ) that pretty much stands for most people feel safe, 
  i get 1ms pinging google.lt from kaunas , lithuania with teo . 
  it used to be that bad in lithuania not too long ago . 
  now you can get 3g in the middle of a lake though . 
  free huh, 
  what democracy . 
  i thought we were talking about russia . 
  edit : fixed engrish, 
  we always had meat , just now we can afford the better cuts , hehe, 
  it 's still not at all justifying anything they did . 
  it 's like saying the robber shot you because you were getting robbed , your fault . 
  actually it 's not at all pilots or airlines fault . 
  commercial planes have scheduled flight plans and trackers . 
  and they would respond to call outs . 
  and it was n't a warzone , because russia never declared war . 
  the only ones that are at fault are the russians . 
  it 's a 100 % act of terrorism . 
  politics . 
  we rich now boys, 
  there always is some kind of a connection , but it 's the furthest one . 
  just because this is all digital it does n't mean these files are n't backed up and/or printed . 
  cyber attacks would have to continue for a while to make some real damage . 
  same in lithuania , just a little more broken , but does n't take very long either . 
  europeans did wipe out the native american population . 
  mostly through disease though not just by killing all of them . 
  mount etna is 3km high , in this picture it looks like it 's almost flat land . 
  no way that 's taken from a plane  those fumes were at about normal flight altitude .

  uhm , that 's a mountain ... http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11965669/astronaut-scott-kellys-best-pictures-from-the-international-space-station.html?frame=3487518, 
  ayy , we live in the same country after all . 
  there is n't even that much corruption in lithuania . 
  most of the corruption is coming from people themselves . 
  so what i think needs changing would be the mindset of the people . 
  it 's currently everything about yourself and for yourself . 
  that 's why we still have scamming , avoiding taxes and bribing . 
  people do n't think about others they are affecting , only think about themselves . 
  that 's also why people here attack lgbt and other minorities . 
  they forget to think `` how do they affect me '' . 
  it 's immediately everything about themselves , like if we allow gay marriage all men will be forced to marry other men . 
  that 's also why we have golden toilets built . 
  better political relations with poland wo n't be coming while kremlin has their puppy in vilnius singing for poles . 
  actually most of them work for 4 weeks then stay 2 weeks at home . 
  some do 6-4 . 
  those who have enough money and prefer to stay with one partner in one truck do 4-4 ( so they can just swap ) . 
  income inequality is a joke at this point . 
  impossible to measure or compare . 
  how is latvia higher up , that is what i do n't get . 
  that is because the pay is very high in comparison to local jobs and you can live in lithuania still . 
  very popular way to make money . 
  probably . 
  but there is less talk about going to london now everywhere . 
  or maybe we got used to it so it 's not a big deal anymore . 
  most people i know actually got out of the emigration trend . 
  it 's more like seasonal work during summers now and try to sustain a job locally . 
  i assume most lithuanian answers were : `` sure , whatever , i have to go suicide now '', 
  oho wheat with honey is a staple http://old.gaspadine.lt/pics/produktas_sausi_pusryciai_kvieciai_su_medumi_1289567622_l1uo73.jpg next is kellogg 's cornflakes . 
  everything else is rare so it does n't qualify as staples . 
   jammi well what the fuck then , tell them to expand to kaunas . 
  kfc exists in like two places , neither of which are near me . 
  it does n't have to be chipotle , but i would love to eat a burrito once in a while . 
  we need mexican fast food . 
  pls chipotle,
