  well , they better watch out for the moderate poles then . 
  he said trump has an idea . 
  high level trolling . 
  latvians do n't like us either , we are loud and we call them zirga galva, 
  yeah , i need some , but i have no idea how to even find a psychologist in the first place . 
  people wise , since we were talking about nations . 
   a nation is a large group of people who share a common language , culture , ethnicity , descent , or history . 
  fuck decembers like this , it 's awful . 
  one autumn is enough for me . 
  i do n't know if i should downvote or upvote that . 
  it 's funny , but at the same time conspiracy nuts might think you are serious so it makes me sad . 
  only on russian owned channels really . 
  and very few on normal channels , but yes , nostalgia for older folk . 
  we ca n't get confused , do n't let global warming win !, 
  you are still as big as all baltics combined . 
  that also works . 
  i did n't think that far . 
  we do use grybas quite often to describe idiots . 
  winter ? 
  well damn , then canadian president is definitely not visiting : /, 
  that 's like the regional equivalent of a flat earther . 
  in my opinion it 's still good for us . 
  even stupid publicity is publicity . 
  maybe we will get a canadian ~ ~ president ~ ~ prime minister visit , heh ? 
  first comment gave advice to send some marinated mushrooms back , mushroom in lithuanian is ` grybas ' which can also mean ' a person who * really * does n't understand that he is doing something wrong ' . 
  it should be negative at this time of the year . 
  predicted 3,5 degrees higher than average temperature this month . 
  rest in pieces earth climate . 
  i 'm pretty sure most people in europe when they say kebab they mean d\u00f6ner kebab, 
  good . 
  do n't know what else to say . 
  i like both ... 
  it 's just not tap water , it has a taste . 
  you do n't drink it everyday . 
  i never said it 's expensive , i said cheaper . 
  borjomi definitely could be cheaper . 
  i 'd like to see georgia in the eu so their wine and water becomes cheaper . 
  i 'm selfish . 
  i 'm pretty sure poland is more hurtbutt because they keep dreaming that vilnius is wilno . 
  hehe, 
  this seems a little old , polish minority is very much a minority in vilnius now . 
  also my previous post was joke . 
  yeah , especially belarus , all we have to do is ask . 
  very offended kebab . 
  russia above us , rip . 
  you guys are mistaken , hehe . 
  wherever they came from , if we do n't know where they came from they ca n't be refugees anyway so just let them sit there in limbo . 
  yes you can deport them . 
  retinas do n't stick around after crimes . 
  yes , because we do n't have much of what to put there . 
  no one is in a hurry , they do research , make sure we do n't pollute ground waters . 
  trust me , if there was a hurry we would be in a hurry . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep_geological_repository and that 's mostly because highly radioactive waste makes up only about 3 % of all radioactive waste , so like a couple of truckloads , we ai n't in a hurry . 
  it just sit 's there next to some nuclear power plants waiting . 
  really , nuclear waste is the least of our problems when it comes to nuclear power . 
  yes , that 's most likely low level radioactive waste . 
  about as bad as what burning coal leaves , just coal puts out more shit into the air . 
  and yes , coal ash is radioactive too . 
  also 126,000 barrels might sound like a lot , but even if you take it as one barrel weighing one ton it 's still only 126,000 tons . 
  again , you could say that 's a lot , but you burn ~ 250 ** million ** ( 250,000,000 ) tons of coal ** every year ** . 
  and only get like ** 12 % ** of your power from it . 
  so yeah , 126000 barrels ? 
  yes please . 
  it 's okay though , nuclear waste can sit there and it does n't actually take up much space because it 's dense af so we can store it until we run out of good fuel . 
  well , nuclear is indeed the cleanest energy source , the problem is nuclear waste . 
  however there are plans of getting rid of it , the reason no one wants to deal with nuclear waste at the moment is because like always , you guessed it , it 's not economical . 
  once we start using up the easy to get fuel we will have to start reusing it . 
  [ these guys are pretty far along on the design and research , it 's really promising .

  same in lithuania . 
  and then japan blew up , good job japan . 
  goodbye our nuclear reactor dreams . 
  good thing swedes are n't stupid and they built enough reactors for everyone . 
  and we do n't quite say they were doing ` certain military tasks ' . 
  welp , we made it in , phew . 
  latvia is lv , hehe . 
  latvia is not included in an article about potato . 
  also we do n't only eat fries with cheese and garlic mayo . 
  most commonly it 's ketchup only or garlic sauce , preferably heinz . 
  go to lithuania , it 's close , it 's cheap . 
  please provide a source explaining why it is hard to convert ak47 into fully automatic , because all i can find is that it 's not . 
  of course downvoting and making fun of people is way easier than providing any sort of evidence of contrary . 
  i do n't like that there are rifles available to consumers anyway . 
  hunting rifles and low caliber pistols is where i draw the line . 
  if you want to shoot something bigger you go to a shooting range or army . 
  even if i had i would n't have converted them to full auto , but that 's what 's the overwhelming answer everywhere i look . 
  yes it is . 
  it 's not click of a button easy , but an average baddie who knows what he is doing can do it quite easily in some dump garage . 
  and judging how they get so many automatic rifles into countries they are banned in i would suggest that 's the way they are doing it . 
  it 's pretty damn easy to convert ak47 and ar15 from semi to full auto . 
  other rifles are n't that easy , but what rifle do terrorists love again ? 
  i think i said it already . 
  wow , you could get around with a map like this . 
  stop it , you are killing me, 
  i 'm lithuanian , [ my latvia is a little different . 
  i live on 220 eur a month solo , not paying rent or taxes for water/electricity/heating . 
  i think it 's doable . 
  perfect , snow shoveling season starts soon . 
  liberals are about as left as you can get in lithuania . 
  lsdp calls themselves left , but what they are pushing towards never seems left to me .
