  [ it 's not the raw amount that matters . 
  it 's not my fault , but yeah , old folk still go to church . 
  the numbers will drop drastically in the next 5-10 years imo . 
  it does n't matter to you , but they keep the statistics . 
  [ if you are christened you have to go through a very long and annoying process of getting out of church logs , which no one tells you how to do , that 's how they keep their billions of believers . 
  you would probably have to sue the church or something . 
  not true , you only get on the list after you are christened . 
  no , the problem is clashing cultures , not nationalism . 
  in lithuania we have polish and russian and ukrainian and belarussian minorities , which you ca n't tell that exist because their culture is very similar to ours and no one gives a crap about each other . 
  muslim culture is medieval and scary to most people , when they come and start to settle down into neighborhoods taking them over people start freaking out . 
  if muslims did n't have their sharia laws and shit no one would notice anything . 
  that 's one ugly photo . 
  i looked at it again , holy shit it 's bad , did you even look at it before posting ? 
  it 's crooked , it 's 240 pixels by 180 pixels and the dynamic range is so bad there is literally no detail in the shadows , like a webcam picture . 
  [ i fixed the crooked part , ca n't fix the fact that it 's jpeg and white balance is out of whack ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4wwn6ss.jpg ) because someone decided to put an instagram filter on it . 
  [ first result in google . 
  yep , murica is definitely very united and there is no hate between groups whatsoever and there are no city districts that have separated minorities . 
  wait ... 
  religion surveys are really , really inaccurate . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_attendance 2004 report . 
  look at the increasing muslim population , instant problems . 
  rip estonia . 
  it 's normally really boring instead of chaotic . 
  but dark and rainy , sure , during winter . 
  during summer it 's actually really bright and the days are insanely long , 17hr + of daylight during summer solstice . 
  potato is safe already , it 's okay . 
  i mean , most of the flooding that happens here is because of the rivers , not the sea . 
  never remember it looking like that . 
  did n't even know estonia can flood . 
  that sounds like a nice russian mentality there . 
  intimidate everyone with your unpredictability . 
  nukes do n't help with little green men , unless you plan to blow yourself up . 
  oh yeah , cold war # 2 is really a nice way to increase the stability in the region . 
  hopefully religious fanatics come through with a good decision * once * and oppose this . 
  and they are upgrading every bus to have it . 
  it 's pretty slow though probably runs on 3g/4g modem . 
  it 's not the invading they fear , it 's the terrorism like in ukraine . 
  there is no way they declare war , but this slimmy way of fighting is also very nasty as we already saw . 
  exactly the focus we have in [ lithuania . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd3dm2iumc8 ) i do n't understand who downvotes these videos , yes they are slightly pr , but quite well done too . 
  [ vice has series of these videos . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/vicenews/search?query=the+russians+are+coming ), 
  i think they were trying really hard to make 3 nice even splits . 
  but yeah , more shades of blue would really help , there are like 20 countries on this list you can easily make 5-8 shades , much more info in one map that way . 
  1978 could maybe make sense . 
  in ussr vilnius did have name with ( ) for some reason . 
  still should n't be vilnious . 
  what about the font ? 
  on drawn maps it 's usually not that ideal or it 's made by a typewriter , this looks neither of those . 
  this one looks drawn , you can see stamped on letters http://beroma.users.photofile.ru/photo/beroma/96077139/122637583.jpg, 
  well , i noticed leningrad is there too . 
  so 1924-1991 and vilnius was in poland 1919-1939 . 
  but then again , map looks computer made . 
  confused as fuck . 
  i wish there were country borders . 
  well since it has vilnius in polish i would say it 's from commonwealth period . 
  but it looks to be made with a computer so no idea what the hell happened here . 
  maybe it 's referring to the time baroque art was spreading ? 
  ye , but still , spanish beer is n't that much more expensive . 
  i can bet czech cheap beer is shitty and average priced beer is good , just like everywhere else . 
  as if beer in spain is n't cheap . 
  still good , but less good . 
  no , winter solstice was celebrated way before we were christened . 
  u\u017egaven\u0117s was pagan , but now it 's raped by christianity , it has it 's date tied to easter . 
  i 'm here all day . 
  her approval ratings rival our best president yet , so i would say she probably is pretty good . 
  focuses a lot on our close neighbors and less on far away countries . 
  i think she got quite unlucky waldemar tomaszewski started his campaign against lithuania during her career so our relationship with poland took a slight hit , not her fault though . 
  also there is n't a better candidate so i would say she is a successful president , no wonder she got reelected . 
  but we do n't really pay attention to halloween and do n't have thanksgiving so it makes sense that we jump right to pagan holiday numba one . 
  you think there are so many latvians ? 
  look at estonians , that 's like half of estonia in one page . 
  ( heh ) also 3 users from china !, 
  those were n't directly affected like kazakhstan was . 
  yes , obviously . 
  apparently not . 
  too deep in bed with russia i guess . 
  well , we call our both parents ** t\u0117vai ** . 
  so not necessarily and our language is fucked . 
  and still , english meaning of the word t\u0117vyn\u0117 is not fatherland , it 's homeland or motherland . 
  fatherland means something completely different . 
  because of this . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor#/media/file:holodomor_world_recognition.png we did learn about this in school in lithuania . 
  no , we call it homeland . 
  our language is just bad like that . 
  t\u0117vyn\u0117 - place where you were born or native land/homeland . 
  nothing to do with your father . 
  ( well not exactly nothing , but still not fatherland ), 
  far from collapse actually . 
  it 's probably the fact that we did n't lie about our debt when joining eurozone . 
  kremlin 's * kremlin takes care of propaganda . 
  putin is just a glorious leader .

  [ russia is lovely . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_enemy_of_my_enemy_is_my_friend ), 
  also not a fan of censorship and awful internet infrastructure . 
  yeah , russia violates air space like 24/7 around baltic sea , if we were as on the edge as turkey has to be we would probably have attacked one of those too . 
  also russians never fucking respond to calls when they violate air space , you can literally read reports of our military , they never respond . 
  it 's eu , not like you are going to north korea , can literally walk back . 
  yes , yes !,
