  exactly . 
  [ home internet is 70gb cap . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hubpekq.png ) where as mobile internet for phones even though they do n't say there is a cap anymore they still say they leave themselves the ability to cap the speed . 
  the cap used to be 20gb most users do n't reach it though . 
  yes , but it 's a new standard as a whole , it 's expensive to implement a new standard , expanding is cheaper . 
  it 's `` unlimited '' though , read the contract , it will say highly reduced speeds after 20gb or something . 
  bit\u0117 in lithuania does this too . 
  not bad , but having no caps would still be nicer . 
  50gb for a laptop or a tablet is n't much at all , especially when we are heading towards 4k content . 
  not too hard for a doctor , finish university and just apply . 
  10 years of university torture does translate to easy job opportunities . 
  yes , wi-fi or 4g development is required ** for more coverage . 
  ** this is not that though , it 's a short distance fast connection . 
   radio equals radiation . 
  no it does n't . 
  that is not the case . 
  it 's harmful in the immediate effect , like a microwave would be harmful if you stick your hand inside of it . 
  but it would n't do shit to you if you sat next to it even though microwaves leak waves like crazy . 
  actual reason powerful radio transmitters are turned off is because getting close to them would be like getting into a microwave . 
  but when you are away it makes no difference . 
  and when talking about wi-fi it 's waaaaay too weak to cause any damage whatsoever . 
  ** edit : ** better example would be a camp fire , if you sit next to a camp fire it 's warm , it 's nice , does n't do shit to you . 
  get too close , you get cooked . 
  [ we actually have silicon valley in lithuania . 
  ] ( http://www.sunrisevalley.lt/ ), 
  well , wi-fi has pretty bad coverage , but this will have even worse , you will need light bulbs for it to work at all and probably pretty direct line of sight . 
  how is light better than radiowaves , it 's worse ... what harmful effect of powerful radio devices ? 
  you know there is no actual documented effect ? 
  yes and everyone has wi-fi . 
  what we need is 100 % 4g or even lte coverage with removed/increased data caps , that would be amazing . 
  this ? 
  wi-fi is already fast enough for a while now , we need more coverage not more speed : /, 
  bible blob of europe . 
  censorship takes time, 
  in lithuania they also are the largest and most well known drug dealers and i 'm not talking weed here , we just ca n't do shit about it , ca n't lock up every single one . 
  no problem mate . 
  we got you covered . 
  so it 's not very dangerous right ? 
  dem media . 
   islamic terrorism is not as dangerous as the media paints it apparently . 
  actually we do n't even notice most of the terror acts they commit because of how much we try to protect ourselves , [ most of the terror happens in asia and middle east ] ( http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/index.html#attacks ) . 
  so yes , it 's bad and media is not painting it at all . 
  i 've been saying that for a while , but since we are in eu it really makes no difference either way , just regions of baltics . 
  [ nearly 10 000 . 
  ] ( http://osp.stat.gov.lt/statistiniu-rodikliu-analize?portletformname=visualization&amp;hash=bd997ee5-ab6b-4fc6-87ae-280d095fea28 ), 
  you can get a bus ticket from riga to vilnius for like 5 eur if you try . 
  yes , lithuanian , pretty much exactly the same as latvian . 
  really hard to notice a difference when i drink it during summer . 
  if he really was roaming around he would be caught already . 
  people have mobile phones . 
  we actually have more sim cards than people in lithuania . 
  you want latvian beer in lithuania or something ? 
  i think it 's just ak-4 . 
  [ here are the weapons our army uses . 
  ] ( http://kariuomene.kam.lt/lt/ginkluote_ir_karine_technika/automatiniai_sautuvai.html ) i ca n't imagine police getting different ones from somewhere . 
  does it matter if you are latvian or not ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xq0kxp5c_o you can clearly hear it 's not exactly like standard lithuanian . 
  yes it 's based on a dead dialect from that region , but now people in that area do n't sound anything like standard lithuanian . 
  at the moment people in vilnius sound really close to it . 
  uh , i disagree . 
  you can clearly tell who is from jurbarkas or \u0160iauliai or vilnius . 
  even me being from roki\u0161kis everyone in kaunas can tell that i 'm not from kaunas originally . 
  not even going to mention samogitian , which is almost a different language . 
  and no , it 's not a product of tv , radio or internet . 
  in school we are taught standard lithuanian ( [ bendrin\u0117 / literat\u016brin\u0117 lietuvi\u0173 kalba ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/literat%c5%abrin%c4%97_kalba ) ) , which happens to be similar to accent from around vilnius . 
  21 % and it 's probably going to increase because of that nice black market we have . 
  it says in the article , normal procedure is destruction of stolen food , but maisto bankas signed a deal to take stolen produce for charity . 
  also i 'm not sure how the manufacturer would go about selling stolen coffee . 
  but if they act the same as the place they moved from why do they need the freedom . 
  not murica, 
  he is the pr image pope christians think they need . 
  to me he is just another pope , on one subject he makes sense on another he goes completely off the chart , like his script just does n't cover some topics so his own believer mind comes through . 
  it does n't matter what they say , think , believe or want to think , there is no sharia law in france , no one dies for drawing anything . 
  people love jesus , but as far as i know drawing jesus with a penis in a guys ass still does n't get you killed in europe . 
  too far east like always ;(, 
  we have about 0.1 % of muslims in our population, 
  religion as a whole , you ca n't make people discredit one fairy tale if you believe in another one yourself . 
  first of all it 's not yet confirmed that it was isis , they took the blame , not confirmed . 
  also it 's not really strange that russian bad news are n't seen in the same light . 
  after all russia is not very nice to it 's surrounding countries . 
  in the shadow of the altars is a pain in the ass to read . 
  forest of the gods is good . 
  we save every single cent on everything because who knows if there ever will be more to come . 
  it does tho . 
  i do n't have to think about 20 different conversions and give money to banks just to exchange currency every time i leave my country . 
  pointless and awesome . 
  dealing with 20 different currencies in europe instead of one is just dumb . 
  execution probably could have been better , but the idea is great . 
  illegal in lithuania too . 
  and enforced . 
  and it 's a good thing . 
  drunks do n't hang around shops anymore . 
  wolves do n't attack people tho . 
  running into a wolf is like winning a lottery . 
  most dangerous creature we have is boar or moose . 
  but we do n't have polar bears . 
  it sucks . 
  i know it was a matter of days . 
  estonia and latvia were with us so it 's strange they did n't do it the same day for bigger effect . 
  i 've heard this too , many times .
