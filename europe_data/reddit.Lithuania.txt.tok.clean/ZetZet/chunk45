  that paperwork should be illegal . 
  of course you would need an exception where employer hires an already pregnant woman unknowingly , then that 's just fraud on the woman 's part and employer should be compensated instead . 
  if they must `` debate '' it then it 's not . 
  but if it 's by choice then it is . 
  does n't say that anywhere in the article . 
  so why debate if the results ca n't be changed ? 
  they said there wo n't be another referendum , now they 're debating it , that 's stalling . 
  again . 
  next year is not a very clear date is it ? 
  stalling again . 
  just an ex-kgb agent . 
  there we go again . 
  people outside of russia think the cold war ended . 
  i said more not everything . 
  government has a party , parties have members which often talk to someone in businesses . 
  i 'm sure there is an idea that is currently leading even if we do n't know what it is . 
  i 'm sure big players know more than we do about what uk is planning . 
  my guess is they delay it forever and switch to norway type thing even if it makes no real sense , it would be the least impactful . 
  pretty much try to shrug it off . 
  no , it 's just pointless news . 
  nothing is happening on brexit front so markets are just recovering to what was before the shock . 
  doubt it since there is still no clear plan for brexit . 
  they still have n't even started leaving ... 
  i do n't see how that 's any news at all . 
  o is not w ? 
  you would think english pronunciation was already sort of fucked , but that 's just next level . 
  so it 's cooroo ? 
  homeless people in finland ? 
  how do they not freeze to death ? 
  yeah so ? 
  is immigrant a race ? 
  guess it 's a new one . 
  like gender neutral one of those new genders . 
  how about uk leaving the common market ? 
  do you think that would be a good reason ? 
  well you have to pretend to be doing something . 
  all these talks of reducing the amount of politicians are scary . 
  no guns . 
  i do n't see a problem with nissan leaving sunderland , after all they 're friends with renault , why not go to france . 
  i did n't see any racism in that video . 
  racist ? 
  you being so butthurt is kind of supporting that reality argument at the moment . 
  especially in this day and age when you could add subtitles for every language and switch on demand . 
  confirmed by / u/yidyokud, 
  yeah , monaco is very relevant because a lot of average people live in monaco and earn average sala ... 
  wait a minute . 
  [ :( ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:pol:ukr:ltu:lva&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ), 
  vilnius 14 % klaip\u0117da 21,3 % kaunas 4,4 % visaginas 52,4 % ( nuclear power plant operating crew and their relatives ) compared to latvia and estonia we basically do n't have any though https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/lietuvos_rusai#/media/file:russians_in_baltic_states_ ( 2011 ) . svg, 
  also different russians , we kicked out most of the russians who came here during ussr . 
  so we have way more russians who lived here for long times , the so called old believers , they do n't seem to care about russia anymore . 
  they barely even speak russian , only sometimes when they 're explaining something between themselves when no one else is in the conversation . 
  they would never greet you in russian or start talking in russian in a store or restaurant . 
  in my hometown pretty much all russian population was left over from the old believers so i 've never actually heard them speak russian between themselves . 
  only after moving to kaunas i now see some russians who speak russian since i live in a district that was once close to army buildings . 
  russians in estonia and latvia seem to be mostly left over from ussr since they were n't kicking them out like we were . 
  if you troll then at least try something subtle . 
  russians think russia is n't evil however . 
  they think we are evil and make them look evil . 
  we are the problem according to them . 
  putin has 80 % support ratings and he has pretty much made himself a dictator already . 
  it 's unlikely to happen here anyway . 
  large scale military move would be spotted before it even happens so it would be like declaring war on nato . 
  that 's pretty much what we have the army for . 
  it 's big enough that you ca n't take it out with a small attack and if you do send an attack big enough then it 's big enough to be a clear declaration of a full scale war . 
  you could cook breakfast eggs right on the pavement , think of the possibilities . 
   they could be having breakfast in vilnius tomorrow morning . 
  not unless they plan to nuke the town . 
  it 's off the scale . 
  yup , streetview comes in really handy sometimes . 
  yeah , but it 's france , they always cut heads of their leaders . 
  my father always answers the question which was better , ussr or free lithuania jokingly . 
  he says : `` ussr , i was 20 then . '', 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  grannies remember their younger years , not better life . 
  edit : / u/sigakoer put it nicely as well, 
  well , but did you sign the petition ? 
  i did . 
  from there . 
  so it worked . . ? 
  wooo, 
  everyone has agendas , if one media outlet posts a false story another media outlet will do a lot to try and expose them . 
  it balances out , if the media is truly free . 
  that 's why you do n't read one newspaper , you read many . 
  it 's the same story as everywhere else . 
  births go down when economy starts improving and equality enforced . 
  women like money too , apparently . 
  let 's not panic yet . 
  take-away is always sliced up everywhere , in restaurants it is n't always so though . 
  take out pizza is sliced , restaurant pizza is n't sometimes . 
  pickled onions are the best thing ever on pizza . 
  ketcup not so much . 
  how does gmo matter one fucking bit for wheat ? 
  there is no gmo wheat . 
  ( there is , but no one is growing it ), 
  not really , unless you 're planning ww3 . 
  and they say humans are n't related to chimps . 
  no one is advocating a low number . 
  even number or very slightly lower . 
  volvo only came out with v90 s90 this year .
