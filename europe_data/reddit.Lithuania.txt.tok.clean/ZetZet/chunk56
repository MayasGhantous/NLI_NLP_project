  at least further away from poland that is . 
  it 's more radioactive though . 
  no they did not . 
  during strawberry season prices drop a lot . 
  it 's not yet the season . 
  you should n't smoke either , but people do . 
  and survive for quite a while . 
  you should do this in an incognito window and not be logged in . 
  i never said norway did n't make a better system , but it 's still very rich . 
  and it is that rich . 
  it 's in the very top of the world in terms of it 's wealth . 
  yes , in gross terms i ca n't afford tesla unless i save my ** full ** salary for 10 years if i were to make 600 euros . 
  yes , the fact that they pay 10 euros for cup of coffee definitely drives down their purchasing power , but the car is still the same price for both them and me . 
  if they get 3k euros and i get 600 and we both set apart say 20 % to save for a car who is going to get there first ? 
  denmark has insane taxes even on ev 's and australia simply has weaker currency to buy import cars and does n't make luxury ev 's locally . 
  that 's ppp , ppp does n't work for imported cars . 
  you do n't make them in norway . 
  it really is that rich . 
  i do n't know * any * person on my family who has bought a new car ever . 
  just for comparison . 
  yeah , conservatives have n't made sense throughout history . 
  mutants, 
  never heard about any pushing . 
  that 's private firearms , your army has enough . 
  chernobyl area is n't that radioactive as a whole . 
  it 's only in couple of places . 
  one of the worst offenders being a basement of a nearby hospital where firefighters left their uniforms . 
  we really need to stop spreading the myth that if you went to chernobyl now your hair would instantly fall off and skin peel off . 
  visiting chernobyl is n't even more radioactive than taking a flight somewhere . 
  oh i know , just saying , most of those guns over here are hunting rifles . 
  and 4.6 out of those are hunting rifles . 
  how do finns serve dog ? 
  ~ ~ also what store is that ? 
  prisma ? ~ ~ * edit : nevermind , i zoomed in to the screen and see it now . 
  can you explain why does that even matter ? 
  what, 
  that 's much better . 
  i know the cartoon . 
  which estonian metal bands are mainstream ? 
  yeah , not a very flattering photo . 
  ha , good thing being lithuanian , you pretty much are expected to be one . 
  this is true for almost every city on the planet . 
  most people live in the suburbs not the city center . 
  the bigger the city the larger the city center area becomes and you get whole parts of city becoming more expensive . 
  that 's how scientific community is supposed to work . 
  everything shared . 
  there are thousands upon thousands of photos on flickr https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa2explore/with/26714974695/ https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa_jsc_photo https://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc, 
  you get paid in london too . 
  or 45 % of media is non-biased and just reporting facts . 
  that 's a stupid way to go about it . 
  based on what evidence ? 
  how do we know which side is lying ? 
  so which side is bias ? 
  leave or remain ? 
  you can fill it up . 
  english speaking people are n't concerned with it as much i 'd imagine . 
  my grandparents also had one in their older apartment like 10 years ago . 
  it dampens sound . 
  but is also a dust hazard . 
  not russians , to answer op 's question , it 's just a trend thing probably . 
  another lovely ussr gift to the world . 
  it rains every day in england , do n't you know ? 
  i never said it 's dangerous , it 's just venomous . 
  boars/moose/bears / lynx are probably more dangerous . 
  but it is venomous . 
  and you never know what complications you can have . 
  people die from peanuts . 
  you have venomous animals . 
  how is a flood event defined ? 
  around rusn\u0117 / \u0160ilut\u0117 there are floods every year in lithuania . 
  okay , let 's leave it at that . 
  even if so usa event is n't comparable to mh17 . 
  i do n't know why we went on this discussion in the first place . 
  yes us did not agree that it was their fault or that they did the wrong thing , but they did claim responsibility . 
  they denied accountability . 
  no , they did claim responsibility , but they did not accept that it was their fault . 
  imagine you are a store manager and you order some product which comes back flawed , you admit that you ordered that product because you are responsible for it to the store owner . 
  but you do n't accept that it 's your fault that it was flawed , you claim that it 's the suppliers fault . 
  edit : yes , exactly what i said . 
  they admitted to shooting it down , they reported shooting it down , they did not accept that it was their fault for doing it . 
  now if you ** proved ** that it was their fault ** then ** they would be responsible . 
  different circumstances completely . 
  train driver was n't even involved in your example , it 's like blaming a building for being tall enough to kill you if you jumped . 
  now if you said : imagine it was dark and you were walking on a sidewalk and a driver felt sleepy , ran you over by accident , he admits to running you over , but he does n't get a punishment other than a fine . 
  that 's more like it . 
  he did take responsibility , he showed up to court , but he was n't punished further . 
  now in your opinion it would seem that the driver should take his own life after that accident to claim responsibility . 
  admitting to doing is taking responsibility . 
  what you mean is they did n't get punished . 
  talk about logic when you do n't understand the statements . 
  yes , they admitted to shooting it down . 
  way further than russia ever goes . 
  settlement happened in court . 
  if iran had anything to go on they would n't settle , they would win . 
  they did , they went to court and paid out a compensation . 
  they never said it 's not our fault for shooting it down , they just claimed it was an accident , and court clearly concluded that it indeed was n't intentional . 
  i mean , i just checked . 
  turkish parliament has 96 women out of 550 slots . 
  clearly less women overall in politics . 
  i never said anything about erdogan , but ministers do n't have to reflect equality , it 's who is picked to do a job , if a woman can do a job good , if there are none who can they do n't get it .
