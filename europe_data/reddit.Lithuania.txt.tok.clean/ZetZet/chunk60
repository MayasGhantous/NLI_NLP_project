  no , the problem was russia singing about peace and equality while annexing ukraine . 
  ww2 was generations ago . 
  it 's a song contest in which the most popular song wins . 
   each participating country submits an original song to be performed on live television and radio and then casts votes for the other countries ' songs to determine the most popular song in the competition . 
  wikipedia knows, 
  a million voices was a good song , but it was straight up hypocritical coming from russia . 
  eurovision is n't just a song contest , it 's a popularity contest too . 
  you have time . 
  just adapt . 
  not having the worst international politics on the globe would help with that . 
  strange that this comment is coming from a dutch person . 
  so you agree with this ? 
  germany has 1 point so far , ukraine 136 ... 
  it 's because of all the weed, 
  well that 's good , that might make them look it up . 
  [ well our design is the same on every coin as well . 
  ] ( https://www.lb.lt/the_2015_lithuanian_euro_coin_samples_have_been_minted ) [ except the commemorative coins . 
  [ the a\u010ci\u016a one is pretty . 
  only western homogay music is haram , old good muslim music is fine, 
  and a live stoning on stage, 
  that 's true . 
  did n't understand anything you typed . 
  music is haram, 
  but it applies to simple road tyres as well , if you fit in slim tyres and large tyres made from the same rubber , use the same pressure the fat tyres will make you use more fuel and will give you , you guessed it , more traction . 
  why do racecars use slick tyres and not grooved tyres ? 
  everything the same applies to trains , if the steel was a completely incompressible material it would n't probably be the case . 
  but that 's only theoretical physics . 
  same thing with trains . 
  steel wears and tears , it heats up . 
  there is a reason they make it so it barely touches the tracks and maglev does n't touch the tracks at all . 
  you have now . 
   that there is some stagnation/recession going on in the automotive industry dieselgate, 
  they fled from mass murder into never-ending war zone . 
  i dislike israel because of where they decided to settle . 
  literally the dumbest fucking place on this whole planet . 
  almost ever since israel began to exist it never stopped being in war . 
  why not go somewhere it is n't so full of conflicting ideologies already ? 
  [ most viewed rap video from lithuania since 2014 : lilas ir innomine - karina ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eypndyqleoa ) [ second most viewed is mad money & alekna - mi casa tu casa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hix6fovc4uc ) , personally not a fan of this one .

  i do n't have a tv . 
  i was sort of hoping that when we switched from analog to digital and tv studios started to change their equipment into one suitable for 16:9 we would get 720p or even 1080i , did n't happen . 
  yeah , on occasion . 
  it does n't work like that in theory , but yet when you choose bicycles for an asphalt road you pick one with slim tyres , why not big fat ones ? 
  should be the same . 
  why do n't you slide the same distance on your shoes as you do on ice skates ? 
  how does hd tv help if the source is trash ? 
  ah the glorious 360p of lithuanian television, 
  2013 on watermarks . 
  you keep telling the same lie over and over it seems plausible after a while . 
  more area , more friction , more traction, 
  you would n't normally shoot down planes for violations , except russians do it intentionally , never respond to call outs and they do it all the time . 
  car tyres are actually insanely grippy . 
  that 's why they wear so much . 
  yeah . 
  contact area is tiny . 
  and to add to that it 's metal on metal . 
   i think he also did n't want to stay at the control stand when the collision was going to happen i 'm sure he is n't suicidal . 
  not maximum safe brake , emergency brake goes as hard as it possibly can . 
  even possibly damaging the train wheels and rails . 
  the thing that makes trains so efficient is also what makes them unable to go uphill and stop . 
  that 's cold . 
  yep , locally caught , fresh frozen . 
  it is larger than every other country in this picture , but it 's not as large as russia , it only looks that way once turkey starts walking towards the camera and russia is left further away . 
  to be honest i hope we shoot down russian jets that violate our airspace too . 
  it happens literally every other day . 
  also turkey and greece are both in nato so i do n't think it 's violating anything by flying over greece . 
  i might be wrong . 
  normally pr is positive things . 
   a part of p89 is going to be repaved this year that would be nice, 
  i hope australia wins this year to make it super awkward . 
  typical, 
  russia bans things left and right . 
  just like belarus . 
  [ still feeling it . 
  negative infinity ? 
  vandalism , hate towards gay people , endorsing fascism . 
  yeah that 's really nice . 
  very lithuanian . 
  [ you should go try out this stretch of the road sometime .

  it 's literally worse than a gravel road , like driving on one of those suspension testing grounds . 
  i 've never seen anything like it anywhere else so that 's an achievement i guess . 
  oh and also , wooden utility poles , haha . 
  probably this http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/17/politics/russia-putin-trump/ pepsi is n't that great imo . 
  pepsi max is pretty good for a sugarless soda though . 
  what now ? 
  it 's hard to respond to comments like these which go from making no sense to making less sense and then negative amount of sense at the end . 
  like reading r/theworldisflat, 
  what you feel is the illogical conditioning of the environment you live in . 
  which i find disgusting personally . 
  no he said gay men , gay women are fine obviously . 
  i like how you said gay ** men ** , the hypocrisy among homophobes is always very strong . 
  it 's latvija . 
  [ there is a border between latvia and lithuania where lithuanian new fresh asphalt ends and gravel road begins .

  english language is set to get weird over the years since it 's becoming more and more global . 
  sooner or later , does it really matter ? 
  i mean , paksas is still around after he suicided . 
  it 's probably electric it would be enough .
