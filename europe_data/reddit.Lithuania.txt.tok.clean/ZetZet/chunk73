  do you spend all your money on food ? 
  yes actually . 
  everything but meat is similar enough . 
  and meat is lower because they have reduced vat on meat . 
  food price is literally the same across eu since it 's the same market , please stop comparing food prices it 's pointless . 
  meh , old news . 
  because they were 20 in the soviet union .

  germans already have it occupied . 
  20 happens very rarely . 
  in the middle of the summer 18-19 is good temp in the baltic . 
  25 would probably be some kind of record . 
  come visit . 
  stores accept them . 
  at least here . 
  they have the thingy thing to check if it 's legit . 
  in this case it does . 
  years of drilling that gay men will rape your children does influence the answer when asked a question if you support gay people . 
  apparently . 
  so did my father and his father and my other grandfather from the mother 's side who was deported to siberia . 
  the difference is that they do n't watch russian tv . 
  my great-uncle watches it too . 
  according to him we were invaded by usa and russia wants to free us again . 
  ( short version ), 
  56mm of rain . 
  stuff broke all over , but it was being fixed overnight , nothing bad . 
  that 's why mine are riveted in . 
  almost lost it in the carwash once and decided that would suck . 
  you should visit us more often , we should visit you more often . 
  we used to have a car that was flooded . 
  some stuff did rust , but not all at once , starter had to be replaced because it seized up . 
  you just have to make sure to clean the computer and maybe grease all the open connections there to stop the rust , if the connections are aluminium it takes a very long time even if you did n't . 
  nothing else is afraid of water in a car , just the electronics . 
  you would be surprised . 
  the interiors could get messed up and will need some chemical cleaning , but other than that they will be fine . 
  half of them in the photo are silver estates . 
  brilliant engineering . 
   do potatoes sink ? 
  have you never boiled potatoes ? 
  tbh vilnius floods more often than any other city in lithuania so the rain collection systems kinda suck either way . 
  that is a very pointless statistic as far as people are concerned . 
  russia has a massive population . 
  serbian population is on the fence if they want to join , albanians want to join . 
  i think they can definitely lose that `` race '' . 
  heinz is n't even uk brand , hehehe . 
  france has two times higher gdp ** total ** and more than two times ** less ** people . 
  in what world could russia have higher gdp ppp per capita . 
  nida is a small tourist city/village , klaip\u0117da is a medium size port city , what are you comparing exactly ? 
  we do n't use twitter . 
  i doubt these buildings have the ability to accommodate 3000 people . 
  raising wages too fast would cut profits for the investors which would slow down investments which would slow down progress which would bring wages down . 
  we are on a stable growth as it is all we need is time . 
  pretty sure every single one we had already left . 
  so you 're doing great . 
  that 's a lie . 
  it was +17 and raining today . 
  tomorrow +18 and raining prognosed . 
  not warm . 
  irl plasma is n't nearly as cool as it is in sci-fi . 
  it 's a website repost . 
   it 's true that for an individual the chance is 1 in a million , but governments and pharma are knowingly killing people . 
  that is basic statistics/probability . 
  that 's absurd to say lmao . 
  not vaccinating kills people , vaccinating has a chance to kill people . 
  because people vote for the idiots and then act all surprised that they actually were idiots . 
  as if russia ever had money to spare . 
  especially now . 
  are you going to give us money ? 
  yes ? 
  then yes . 
  to everything . 
  yes , how does that stop you from being conservative ? 
  i do n't like it . 
  it does n't look consistent . 
  yeah , it 's not very good . 
  if federation ever happens i would hope they redesign the eu flag and make it work with `` state '' flags . 
   which was the idea of building a christian theology that does not make any transcendent claims . 
  like i said whatever messed up thing, 
  in a world with atheist priests this is n't all that surprising anymore . 
  everyone can believe whatever messed up thing they want to believe . 
  3200 according to 2014 data . 
  that 's not too bad . 
  looking at google maps the big blob seems to be 10-15km in diameter . 
  phones are n't singled out . 
  the thing is on mp3 players too , if you ever had one . 
  just electricity ? 
  all of them ? 
  what are you saying exactly . 
   why single out phones ? 
  to protect people who are unaware . 
  what you decribed would be intentional . 
  you can turn it off on phones too . 
  so your phone is broken therefore every phone is . 
  yes . 
  but in general it still works well enough . 
  if it just drops the top end below 100db it 's good enough . 
  that is irrelevant since this protection is applied to the amp of the phone . 
  source could only be more quiet . 
  they do have a general idea . 
  if it 's built around 8ohm earbuds anything else is just going to be more quiet .
