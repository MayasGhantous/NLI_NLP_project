  that 's exactly why you can turn it off . 
  it still protects people who are unaware of the danger and that 's the point . 
  simply protection for your ears . 
  some headphones go way beyond non-damaging level of sound . 
  usa is doing war . 
  just like russia . 
  how can you have combat experience during peaceful times ? 
  neither is lithuania , it 's just kompot though . 
  it 's a drink . 
  ] ( https://www.google.lt/search?q=%d0%9a%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%bf%d0%be%d1%82&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewim2lmeu8nuahwgk5okhykzahmq_auibigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=934 ) that you can prepare other ways . 
  kompot is water with fruits . 
  it 's supposed to be a beverage . 
  how can there be too much water in a drink . 
  natural gas is the cleanest compared to anything at the moment . 
  oil and wood not so much . 
  wood is mostly bad in cities because of particles . 
  it 's long and very narrow . 
  which means accidents would happen quite often when pushing . 
  and clearing those accidents in high speed racing while on an insanely long track is just not feasible . 
  but they capitalize all of them . 
  not keywords . 
  yup . 
  the track is too narrow for pretty much anything but amateur racing . 
  even wec does n't do nordschleife . 
  time is weird like that . 
  apparently capitalizing every letter in every word in the title is the correct thing to do . 
  http://time.com/ just look at their front page . 
  i think it 's an american thing . 
  https://www.nytimes.com/ does it too . 
  people who invented english do n't do that . 
  when someone blows up over here we will be . 
  numberplate says 98 . 
  so spb . 
  it 's a spb video too . 
  i mean i was just watching a video they uploaded yesterday . 
  https://youtu.be/sdjdqo42_ko?t=3m42s this guy would be pulled over in seconds . 
  i 've seen cars with all windows tinted on stop a douchebag . 
  that would get you pulled over in half a second over here and your vehicle inspection would be cancelled so you could n't even drive home with it . 
  so no one has noticed the number plate covering epidemic . 
  it 's not possible in any reasonable country . 
  russia is corruption land though . 
  so then you fine the jeep driver for not stopping and running the red light . 
  but they do sometimes come . 
  it seems like they do n't give nearly enough fucks , but still . 
  how hard is it to write a fine for covering number plates . 
   they feel injustice , but can not tolerate activists . 
  `` stop a douchebag '' has a lot of evidence on that . 
  edit : also how is n't covering your plates illegal in russia ? 
  like every douchebag on those videos has their plates covered . 
  yeah trade school was included in my `` degree '' . 
  i meant people who left just after finishing school . 
  the ones that i know who finished trade school here got a job instantly and settled in their home town . 
  from my circle people who went to universities mostly stayed , but all of the ones who did n't even get a degree left . 
  yes . 
  but our gdp is still growing . 
  in total . 
  also 26 per 100,000 people killing themselves makes for 0.026 % of the population . 
  oh yeah , we kill ourselves to make our gdp grow . 
  we do n't make shit and still grow pretty fast . 
  this is for new cars . 
  fiat 500 is killing it . 
  all the rich dads buy them for their daugthers . 
  i heard there was a plan to lay fiber down in all of germany that went nowhere . 
  50gb is not impossible to exceed at all . 
  one hour of 1080p youtube is like two gigs . 
  i used my 25gb in three days while in the hospital . 
  and i was holding back watching medium quality . 
  germany does n't understand internet . 
  so any , but two . 
  every house has a vent system . 
  if it did n't you would have mold everywhere . 
  only the most famous lithuanian youtuber . 
  * on the internet, 
  [ they also make good underwear . 
  ca n't see any in my apartment with all entry points closed . 
  since 1966, 
  that 's where some of our olympic medalists train . 
  are those cookies or cupcakes . 
  they look like some strange cookies if they are cookies . 
  [ they are cupcakes , i checked . 
  bus routes have excellent 4g because the wi-fi that is available on buses runs on the same 4g . 
  it 's a given . 
  even if spain/others did n't veto it would take years to join back . 
  years of collapsing economy which is built on eu/spain . 
  ads are needed to keep the services running . 
  it 's not like he started selling torrents . 
  and adblock is a thing every pirate should be using anyway . 
  that last part is insane . 
  they will be able to sell you drinks in bars from 18 , but they will not be able to describe what it tastes like beyond what the label says since it 's implying they tasted it . 
  this is what happens when you elect idiots . 
  but you have an eu flag . 
  and you want to separate from eu . 
  it 's not all that magical . 
  the deaths by coal are n't direct , but they can be modeled . 
  do they count the plastic ones in the statistics ? 
  because then i do n't doubt it . 
  you can drink and you can buy it . 
  it 's not 2018 yet . 
  so they should make less milk . 
  there is far too much milk on the market for the price to go up .
