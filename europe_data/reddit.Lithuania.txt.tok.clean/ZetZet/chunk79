  greek to be exact . 
  - teka ending stands for place . 
  diskoteka , biblioteka , vynoteka is a brand name made in that style , comes from vinotheque in french i would guess . 
  military encirclement . 
  when can i start laughing ? 
  unfinished vinegar you mean . 
  vynoteka does n't have any . 
  few armenian ones though . 
  but russians like putin . 
  if montenegro joined the eu average gdp per capita in the eu would go down from 33,998 usd to 33,965 . 
  montenegro is n't that far from romania . 
  in a decade it is definitely doable . 
  total gdp does n't matter , per capita is more important . 
  flag annotations did n't work for some reason so i thought it was a serbian flag . 
  anyway , if you 're croatian you do n't have much to change , kuna has been pegged to euro for a long time so it 's just a name change . 
  also they got really slick with the change . 
  we just switched and it was smooth as anything . 
  except now everyone complains about rising prices , forgetting the fact that the economy is recovering after 2008 as well . 
  it 's now suddenly the fault of euro , even though litas was pegged for years . 
  my bad . 
  it 's small . 
  are you trying to make fun of something i said or make fun of lithuania ? 
  i lost you long time ago . 
  i do n't see a pineapple . 
  ethopian flag does n't have a pineapple either ? 
  what ? 
  that would be the same as pegging currency to euro . 
  just a name change , not much effect . 
  i do n't think you would have the choice to keep your currency if you joined these days . 
  of course joining will take a while . 
  to be honest comparing pretty much every eu country to albania would make them rich . 
  being many times richer and living a comfortable life is probably depressing to albanians . 
  well you vote for the one you like a little bit more . 
  it 's not like if you do n't vote they will go away . 
  i know there is no duty , but it seems strange that so many people who voted in round 1 would just decide not to on the second round . 
  so 40 % of fillion voters will just not vote ? 
  which it sort of is . 
  it 's stereotypes and stereotypes exist for a reason . 
  yeah , this map covers it quite well . 
  afaik vikings did n't really raid the baltics . 
  they had a few settlements which were mostly for trade purposes . 
   ** you ** cut canabis with tobacco , so ** your ** claim is pretty much ... well weird . 
  when you smoke canabis , ** you ** actually smoke both . 
  brainfried, 
  i am not bragging about anything . 
  you just assumed that if you smoke weed you have to smoke tobacco , which is not the case . 
  and it 's not the same . 
  marijuana smoke is less damaging as shown in many studies and it 's not addictive . 
  not to mention tobacco addicts often smoke all day every day . 
  a pack a day is not that rare . 
  no one would smoke that much weed every day . 
  well that is your choice . 
  i like my drugs less shitty . 
  you only do that if you 're saving cannabis since it 's illegal and you only get tiny bits of it and the prices are high . 
  normal people who can buy it legally do n't do that . 
  i actually do n't do that either since tobacco smoke is nasty . 
  it 's not grown in the nicest conditions since it 's a little bit illegal everywhere . 
  and they do n't use the most organic ways of growing it as you might imagine . 
  tainted marijuana does happen . 
  pesticides mostly . 
  and that shit can kill you since you are smoking it . 
  also the conditions for growing marijuana are n't exactly `` everywhere in whatever conditions '', 
  we are apes . 
  great apes to be exact . 
  it 's actually worse than that . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/us-presidential-election-rigged-donald-trump-wisconsin-video i ca n't believe how a candidate running in the elections can even say this without any evidence . 
  murica . 
  actually the whole `` hillary is crooked '' angle was just absurd to me . 
  i would classify that as an attack on a person , but i guess everything goes in us elections . 
  taxed and * regulated * . 
  quality controlled weed is way better than illegal weed from afghanistan grown in who knows what conditions . 
  it 's waaaay different than ciragettes . 
  there is no psysical effect of withdrawal so you ca n't actually get psycically addicted to it and it does n't ruin nearly as much of your body compared to alchohol and cigattes . 
  not to mention you do n't constantly smoke it because it hits way harder than cigarettes . 
  i would support a ban on strong alcohol that is made for the sake of cheap strong alcohol . 
   well , anyway , i 've made this aerial video for these guys  just wanted to share it over cuz its fun . 
  should have started from that . 
  it 's a video on a youtube channel of a company that is advertised in the video and the description has 3 links to buy stuff that is advertised . 
  it 's an advertisement . 
  it 's not even a good video , it 's shaky , it 's full of text and the quality is poor . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xthe09hpq much better . 
  autopilot was not necessary to use and people knew the risks . 
  same, 
  no one is demolishing brick houses anytime soon . 
  they will be renovated . 
  the only houses that might get demolished in a couple decades are the concrete panel ones because they develop structural problems with age . 
  you think ? 
  so wait , they add stuff and that is not required to be labeled ?

  ( the yogurt you 're eating might be shitty ), 
  that would mean they would have to write those additives on the package . 
  it 's the same mechanical process , just not with a spoon . 
  what 's not natural about skimmed milk ? 
  you can skim milk with a spoon . 
  it separates , naturally . 
  the milk that does not separate is homogenized . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homogenization_ ( chemistry ), 
  he bought the `` ghost '' building in the middle of kaunas and is tearing it down himself . 
  this guy is committed . 
  of course there still are haters since he is quite a strange person and he likes making trendy videos .
