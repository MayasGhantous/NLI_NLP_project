  not like i followed them . 
  it just seems that the current ones are much smaller and/or much more secret and less influential . 
  daktaras was basically a famous criminal at one point and now he is just another guy that is locked up . 
  they also like having freedom of movement and not being deported to siberia . 
  also you ca n't call ussr an organization since it was controlled by single goverment . 
  it 's mostly contraband and stealing cars . 
  the largest groups were hunted down fast after we joined eu . 
  dictatorships are not allowed afaik . 
  and russia has n't had democracy ever . 
  feels like a different country , most of the buildings are german style and there are the huge dunes . 
  because it is . 
  at least in a couple of thousands of years . 
  they also hate weed . 
  banning things trendy now . 
  our government is on the same train . 
  latvia is good for relaxing and very cheap . 
  but the sea is cold if you 're from spain you would probably die . 
  germans do n't seem to mind . 
  worth mentioning that 4 is passable in school , 5 is passable in university or college . 
  english is mandatory from the first grade i think now . 
  it used to be from the 4th or 5th when i went to school and in the 9th grade you get to pick a third language . 
  which then you can drop in 11th grade if you do n't want to continue . 
  it 's mostly because 2 strokes ca n't do shit about emissions , they are terrible in that regard . 
  majority still are . 
  some newer ones have the ability to premix oil and petrol themselves though . 
  ] ( http://www.vilkyskiu.lt/en/produktai/cheeses ) quite a new brand , focuses on the gimmicks quite a bit . 
  but also popular . 
  good kefir and `` oland\u0173 '' cheese is my favourite gouda-type cheese . 
  they are probably making different stuff to export , for your market . 
  but there is the [ `` hunter 's cheese '' ] ( http://www.vilkyskiu.lt/en/produktas/hunters-cheese ) never had it . 
  it exists . 
  but more lithuanian would be pressed cottage cheese . 
  [ they do add seasoning to it sometimes ] ( https://www.google.lt/search?q=cottage+cheese+lithuania&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjyl4gcqobuahuhcswkhtqpcuoq_auicigb&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=990#tbm=isch&amp;q=varskes+suris ) what brand is the lithuanian cheese in prague ? 
  also good beef cuts are expensive af . 
  d\u017eiugas , it wins all the popularity contests . 
  but i would guess tilsit is the most eaten type . 
  i think he wanted jargon . 
   babk\u0117s - russian jargon . 
   ba\u0161liai - no idea what 's the meaning of this word even in our language  \u0160aibos - washer , also from russian , used for both farts and money , which makes it strange . 
  that 's because our language was only standardized very recently . 
  it was probably a little mangled with polish and russian before that . 
   as you can see we are not very creative . 
  you are no match for us . 
  oh , it 's incredibly interesting over here :  pirmadienis - first day  antradienis - second day  tre\u010diadienis - third day  ketvirtadienis - fourth day  penktadienis - fifth day  \u0160e\u0161tadienis - sixth day  sekmadienis - seventh day see . 
  very interesting . 
  so you believe in that or your own version of that, 
  there is no word for what you believe , deism sort of . 
  basically a completely imaginary situation from your part . 
  that all happened in the last couple thousand years . 
  out of millions . 
  also it 's a false argument . 
  it 's like the one that says `` earth is perfect for life , if it was any different we would not exist '' well no fucking shit , that 's why we do exist, 
  aka personal god . 
  `` all those people ca n't be wrong , there must be something magical '', 
  it 's from boreholes . 
  the water itself is perfectly good , but if you drink it alone there is a slight aftertaste which is why i buy bottled water to drink . 
  i do boil the tap water for coffee and tea and making food . 
  there are too many to list . 
  it 's cereal . 
  https://www.barbora.lt/paieska?order=pricedesc&amp;uzklausa=sausi%20pus somewhat representative . 
  if you go to a smaller store you will always find : original kellogg 's corn flakes , frosties , nestle nesquik , local oho stuff . 
  those are pretty much guaranteed . 
  it 's not too high , if you reduce vat you will have to tax something else . 
  at least vat is somewhat representative , people who spend more pay more taxes . 
  yes . 
  one of which we have a lot and the other none . 
  heroes is a blatant rip off hot of the press . 
  it 's shameful eurovision did n't deny the entry . 
  scotland is a different country pretty much . 
  great britain is rarely used . 
  you do n't have 30 random people on your bike , do you ? 
  cycling is better than bus . 
  you exercise , spend time in the air . 
  one of the advantages you speak of when you mention bus travel , which has none . 
  i 've traveled by bus many many times . 
  but the only reason , the only reason is that it 's cheap . 
  and it 's the worst . 
  that 's why it 's cheap . 
  and that 's why a lot of people choose public transport . 
  say it has pluses , but you do n't list them . 
  people travel by public transport out of need , not by choice . 
  bus has no pluses . 
  not a single one . 
  it 's currently the worst thing you could travel in . 
  sure , but air con does n't block the sun . 
  people will be sweating . 
  air con does n't solve that problem . 
  car ? 
  okay . 
  but no sane person would choose a bus . 
  especially in the summer . 
  hot sweaty nasty box full of random people . 
  estrella means star in spanish . 
  i have no idea why swedish chips brand uses that name , but they are popular here as well . 
  the time it takes depends on the circumstances . 
  if the person died on friday for example they will be buried by sunday because it 's far more convienient for people who want to come . 
  also in the summer it 's generally a couple of days at most . 
  first things are set up at the funeral home and people come visit . 
  the day of the burial people go to church , after church everyone gathers at the funeral home drive in a column towards the cemetery , burial is always closed coffin , priest comes and it 's wrapped up in an hour or so . 
  after burial people gather for a meal .
