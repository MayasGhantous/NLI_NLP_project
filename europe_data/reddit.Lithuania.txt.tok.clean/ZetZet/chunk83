  that 's what it is for catholic funerals though , i have n't been to any other . 
  whole one kilocalorie . 
  nasa once lost a $ 125 million dollar mars orbiter because of units . 
  nasa used metric , lockheed martin used dumb ones . 
  normal peanut butter is just peanuts salt and some kind of oil to prevent separating of the peanut oil . 
  it 's not sweet at all . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opgbl2a-rry usa vs lithuania 2000 olympics , we almost got them . 
  rinkodara is not a thing . 
  it 's a fucking vaizduoklis type of situation . 
  no , you have old prices . 
  prices do n't go down anymore . 
   kebab 2.10 e what kind of dump sells kebabs for so cheap ? 
  they do n't exist . 
  maxima , clear leader nothing comes close . 
  iki , focuses on smaller stores mostly . 
  norfa , focuses on the cheapest price . 
  rimi , focuses on bigger stores mostly . 
  lidl , going to overtake norfa soon i think . 
  aib\u0117 , has the most stores in lithuania , but most of them are corner stores or village stores . 
  it 's not going extinct because of eating . 
  you can actually catch as much signal crayfish as you want in my country . 
  at least in some lakes . 
  european crayfish catch is limited , but it tastes better . 
  red squirrel will be fine . 
  european crayfish is getting fucked though https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austropotamobius_pallipes, 
  we do n't do that over here . 
  killed everything seriously dangerous long ago . 
  yep , they are common , but not top sellers in any store , you can look at the lists by `` popular '' or check the list on mobili.lt . 
  young adults like the flagships so that 's mostly what you see i guess . 
  our villagers would sell their guns to buy more booze . 
  i watch it , my father used to watch it a while back , but it 's not very big . 
  problem is there are n't any f1 races close enough for us to visit . 
  hungary is very far to go by car . 
  need something in poland or scandinavia . 
  religion or ethics , you get a choice . 
  made in eu means made in poland . 
  at least over here . 
  it does n't make much sense it 's just random words made from letters on the alphabet and some filling inbetween . 
  i do n't think low income workers can afford to buy anything anywhere . 
  maybe in a village . 
  mostly things around 300 euros . 
  huawei p8/p9/p10 lite , galaxy a series are hits . 
  or older flagships . 
  samsung s7 is around 450 euros now . 
  currently galaxy a5 2017 is very popular . 
  iphones are just too expensive . 
  also israel was n't given back to anyone , it was artificially made . 
  you ca n't give back something that never existed before . 
  just because you do n't know the score does n't mean there is n't a score . 
  you can have multiple loans at a time . 
  of course . 
  how else would you keep track of stuff ? 
  it 's called `` paskol\u0173 rizikos duomen\u0173 baz\u0117 '' which translates to `` loan risk database '' and it 's kept by the bank of lithuania . 
  what the fuck does usa have to do with israel ? 
  the genocide of native americans is ignored because it happened so long ago . 
  not to mention the main cause of native american extinction was disease europeans brought to americas . 
  and yes , some of it was n't , but at the time slaves were a thing as well . 
  what do you want usa to do ? 
  we spend about 23 % of our pay on food . 
  but that number is always decreasing since our pay is rising faster than food prices . 
  eating lunch in a restaurant is perfectly affordable for majority of people . 
  but going to a restaurant to eat dinner every day would n't be . 
  yes , russia would love to be relevant again , as things are now it 's slowly fading away lying in a pile of it 's own terrible decisions . 
   eu is restrictive to countries outside of it and profitable to countries inside . 
  it acts as an empire . 
  it acts as a country . 
  which is one of the main points . 
  i do n't understand what are you even arguing about anymore . 
  what eu does to outside countries is it gives you a market of 510 million people . 
  you might get a shit deal , but a big one . 
  currently russia is not allowed to sell stuff to the eu not because of single market , but because they are at war with ukraine . 
  single market has nothing to do with that . 
  what are the silly restrictions you talk about ? 
  the sanctions eu put on russia ? 
  also why should it benefit russia ? 
  european single market is meant to benefit people in it . 
  you say welfare i say investment . 
  they bring us to eu level so we can consume stuff they want to sell us and give them our people to make make that stuff . 
  \u0105 \u010d \u0119 \u0117 \u012f \u0161 \u0173 \u016b \u017e  \u0104 , \u0105 - a as in above ( uh )  \u0118 , \u0119 - e as in ketchup - the alternate pronunciation ( same as a in man )  \u0116 , \u0117 - e as in parquet ( ey )  \u012e , \u012f - i as in machine ( ee )  \u0172 , \u0173 - u as in duke ( oo )  \u016a , \u016b - u as in duke ( oo ) ( yeah these two are the same at this point )  \u010c , \u010d - c as in cello ( ch )  \u0160 , \u0161 - s as in sugar ( sh )  \u017d , \u017e - z as in azure ( zh ) edit : and we do n't use q w x, 
  the main difference is that ussr decided to drag everyone down to be level and eu is trying to bring everyone up to level . 
  also one is voluntary , other is n't . 
  first time i got very drunk was 18 . 
  but i had tasted it many times before , my parents were good about making alcohol not seem like some banned thing that is amazing , just a thing that tastes good . 
  obviously it has to be a church of some kind https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_of_st._nicholas,_vilnius this one is more fancy though https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_of_st._anne,_vilnius, 
  how is the battery after all these years ? 
  it was n't very good new afaik . 
  i think it was the deal nokia made with microsoft to start making windows phones . 
  windows phone has killed a lot of stuff in it 's path , including itself . 
  or banking crisis was one of the causes of the nokia collapse . 
  right ? 
  they say internet is near endless , but i feel like i 've used it all already . 
  new things ca n't come out fast enough for me to consume them . 
   brexit is n't an excuse when it has n't happened yet as far as investments are concerned it has happened already . 
  gbp did n't drop for no reason . 
   and which countries are relying on greece for imports/exports ? 
  the ones that use euro for trading . 
  well to be fair usa did n't have greece and brexit . 
  these two things slowed down recovery in europe and that 's why this gap opened . 
  most have n't recovered to 2008 levels yet . 
  but the ones that are still not doing well are finland , italy , spain , portugal , greece .
