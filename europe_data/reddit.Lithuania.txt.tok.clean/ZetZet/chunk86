  trump won because most of americans were pissed at the average policitian in the us so they voted for one that 's different . 
  who knows , maybe trump and the republicans in the government will make good changes in the end . 
  it 's not massive anymore . 
  it used to be massive when we exported cars further east . 
  now it 's basically just for the locals . 
  if you want climate similar to northern us pick slovenia , if you want canada pick estonia . 
  if you want to live in a bigger city then lithuania is the choice . 
  i would go to slovenia for the climate . 
  there is n't much difference in standards of living . 
  climate thing i agree on . 
  it 's cold and wet here . 
  it 's because of the way you speak mostly . 
  finnish people suffer from the same problem , also stereotypical finn speaking english feels like it 's slowed down . 
  for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0iz_tezg7m, 
  vilnius-kaunas is a busy road there are private small express buses/taxis and normal express buses which never stop , there are also trains . 
  that 's a little different . 
  bus routes are planned for 70km/h because old buses could n't go any faster so new ones also have to go at snails pace . 
  there are express buses which have timetables changed , but not all of them . 
  they really should update the times , but then again 70km/h saves on fuel . 
  i took a bus home from kaunas once took me 3.5 hours when in a car it takes me 2-2h 20min depending on traffic and how much i speed . 
  the 8 hours route is also one with 2 bus changes so that 's why it 's so slow , only one direct bus on that timetable is 6h 50min . 
  ah it 's shit anyway just go to latvia , it 's less infested with lithuanians . 
  definitely . 
  there are people without cars and going on a bus is painful for everyone . 
  especially from far away , for example i 'm originally from roki\u0161kis , going to palanga on a bus is just ... [ somewhat of a job . 
  ] ( http://image.prntscr.com/image/edc7ffcd513e4a92a252565aa360ea44.png ) and then you have to stay somewhere , which not everyone can afford . 
  imagine a family with 4 kids , no car going to palanga . 
  6x30eur for just one way trip , then find a place for 6 people to stay ... 
  and young . 
  few of my classmates have never been , but that was a few years back , maybe this newer generation does have more money to spend on vacations . 
  do n't you dare leave us behind again . 
  i think people who can torrent watch game of thrones and who ca n't watch some shitty local tv show . 
  our tv channels do n't have many good shows . 
  there is almost no change except for natural fluctuations and inflation . 
  the only thing that actually changed is the price of services . 
  for example in hesburger everything became slightly more expensive . 
  10-20 euro cents . 
  that 's explained by the increased minimal pay . 
  that 's because his argument would n't work if he said what it actually costs . 
  i know for a fact that prices did n't rise much at all beyond natural inflation . 
  i get set amount of money from my parents as a student and i can still afford the same things . 
  latvian president is `` pagan '' , i do n't think our `` pagans '' actually believe in the gods , but they enjoy the traditions . 
  remove ? 
  invent more or encourage ? 
  why ? 
   diversity is always good when was it ever ? 
   i 'd rather increase the status of minority languages and dialects . 
  what is the reason for that ? 
  my tribe better than your tribe ? 
  humanity does n't need more division . 
  when i hear dutch on camp sites i think `` oh that 's german , no wait that 's an english word , oh wait that must be dutch then '', 
  nah , latvia is definitely more similar . 
  poland technically was n't in ussr so even from those times latvia and lithuania pretty much shared a `` border '' instead of a border . 
  i would say rusn\u0117 . 
  small city , a lot of german architecture . 
  it 's not very touristy because there is n't much to do apart from eat locally smoked fresh fish . 
  but it is becoming more touristy every year it feels like . 
  polish labour is cheap , there are millions of poles , also you make things like these http://wielton.com.pl/products/oferta-wielton/naczepy-furgonowe/ lithuanian labour is also cheap that 's why there are so many lithuanian truck drivers . 
  most trucks drive all around europe depending on what they load up , it 's rare for companies to use trucks to move specific things back and forth and those are generally registered in country they stay . 
  for example you load up something like furniture in poland , you take that to spain , you load up something spain makes you take that to germany , you take something from germany , take that to france and keep going . 
  it makes no difference in what country you register so polish companies just register locally because that 's where they repair their trucks and do mot checks . 
  most companies hire trucks instead of having their own , having your own trucks and drivers is rarely good business . 
  call us `` basically russia '' and not eat local food . 
  do n't come to lithuania to eat pizza . 
  student , my parents gifted me 1 room apartment in kaunas as a starter pack . 
  did you read the title of the article you posted ? 
  https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2014/09/swedish-parliament-shutterstock_1250px.jpg https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/stockholm_city_hall_2008-07-15-1_filtered.jpg also every eu country 's embassy in sweden has one for sure . 
  it 's built in the uk which means all of the security checks will be performed by the uk . 
  i do n't see what 's the problem , i do n't think uk has enough nuclear specialists to build power plants , china definitely does . 
  '' \u012e sveikat\u0105 '' , basically cheers , but means `` for good health '' if you take it literally . 
  used to mean every soft drink , but now we use vaisvandenis ( fruit water ) with limonadas reserved for lemon and water . 
  we did the same thing you did . 
  virtually no problems . 
  the genius thing is taking the old currency in the store and giving change back in euros , took out most of it in weeks . 
  [ baumkuchen ] ( https://vimeo.com/79480881 ) stolen german cake we still cook over fire in some places . 
  just do n't buy the general store ones , not worth the time . 
  [ \u017dagar\u0117liai ] ( https://www.google.lt/search?q=%c5%bdagar%c4%97liai&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiptf6ew4lpahuokpokhyefb5sqir4ijae&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=960 ) are nice , but again , hard to find good ones anywhere in the store . 
  skruzd\u0117lynas , tinginys , \u0160imtalapis ( not lithuanian , tatar , but we still have it ) not much heritage to preserve i guess . 
  keturratis ( quadwheel ) and vandens motociklas ( literally water motorcycle ), 
  it 's just an argument that 's impossible to win . 
  poland and lithuania were a commonwealth for hundreds of years and then when he was born they both seized existing , so who can really tell his nationality . 
  glad we talked . 
  lithuanian nation did n't exist pretty much . 
  yes , his work was about russian tyranny , so what ? 
  he also helped polish rebels . 
  how is that stupid ? 
  none of his work is about poland ( which did n't exist at the time ) . 
  he was from a lithuanian ( did n't exist at the time ) / belarusian ( belarus was n't even a thing back then ) descent . 
  he spent his early years in lithuania ( which did n't exist ) the only thing polish about him is that he wrote in polish . 
  which can be easily explained by the polonization of lithuania . 
  at the time lithuanian identity was barely a thing . 
  no , he identified as lithuanian . 
  he actually said he was lithuanian in his own texts and yet you keep arguing he was n't . 
  he just took polish nationality and language because those were convenient at the time . 
  it 's like saying every pole born in usa is immediately only american , strip all heritage . 
  why do you keep saying that ? 
  province of poland . 
  lithuania was never a province of poland . 
  especially not in his lifetime . 
  when he was alive it was russian empire .
