fair in all points . 
  do you know that in lithuania latvians are almost exclusively referred to as ` braliukai ' ever since the latvian announcer called us that when granting latvian points in eurovision some years ago ? 
  looks like the footage is of mixed age , there are some completed microdistricts that were finished in late 1980 's and some buildings under construction that were finished before 1978 . 
  it must be . 
  yes , that sounded a bit absurd . 
  the russians have a notion of the ` neighbourman ' supervillain : http://s00.yaplakal.com/pics/pics_original/1/1/0/537011.jpg, 
  is it racist to think that kenyans dominate marathon running because of their innate advantage , or to think that they developed the ability by due to their circumstances ( running to school , chasing sheep , whatever ) ? 
   the report , the fifth to be produced on the human rights situation since the outset of violence in ukraine , documents a wide array of serious abuses committed primarily by the armed groups who have seized control over a large part of the donetsk and luhansk regions in the country 's east since mid-april . 
   it also documents violations committed by ukrainian forces in their efforts to recapture territory , from which armed groups are conducting operations and in which they have located military objectives . 
  i read it as ` the insurgents are criminally cruel , but the army is not faultless too ' . 
  which is not something unexpected , e.g. 
  considering the documented abuses of the us army iraq . 
  truth be told , many of these images are from the beginning of the hostilities in april and may . 
  the previous 5 years or so we were paying the worst rate in europe to gazprom . 
  but now we have an lng terminal ready to take its first load in a month 's time , and a successful arbitration case against gazprom , plus the gas price is indexed of crude oil price , which is at historic lows now , so the price of gas has gone down a bit . 
  this is gdp ppp . 
  that is , it 's adjusted for things we get cheaper because of cheap labour . 
  in nominal terms lithuania is ~ $ 16k and portugal is ~ $ 21k . 
  good point !, 
  lithuania today announced an increase of the minimal wage from $ 289 to $ 300 from october 1 . 
  this year lithuania has probably surpassed portugal by gdp ppp per capita . 
  paste it into google translate and hit the speaker icon , for the top-30 languages the pronunciations are pretty good . 
  there is no letter w in the latin alphabet . 
  vilna is fine in pre-ww2 english . 
  wilna is as much of a mistake as vilno is though . 
  i think it 's an inherent property of aerial footage -- the land below looks like a toyish , pretty , idealised railway model landscape . 
  if all you have is a hammer ... 
  recently one russian blogger came and took photos of ` good and bad vilnius ' . 
  he was looking for dirt , so he found it . 
  it made quite a buzz in the internets . 
  http://zyalt.livejournal.com/1096687.html that said , my impression of the place i live in is much closer to this video than this blog post . 
  ` cheap ' meaning a determined enthusiast can afford one . 
  that was not the case 5 or 10 years ago . 
  here 's one from a couple of days ago : [ vilnius , lithuania ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t1.0-9/10516586_10153041433708332_70390124765328003_n.jpg ) . 
  and there 's no `` lactose intolerance gene '' . 
  ability to digest lactose post infancy is an adaptive mutation in the regions where dairy products are prominent in the diet . 
  well , if you 're after anecdotal evidence , my wife has recently figured out why she hates ice cream and is sick of coffee with milk . 
  she switched to espressos and feels fine after having a coffee again . 
  then she found out that there are more lactose-intolerant people in the extended family . 
  come on !, 
  that was a very appropriate entry to the eurovision , well done this year , really !, 
  you were not far off -- it 's onomatopoeia for `` i said a-hip-hop '' from rapper 's delight . 
  lithuania , too . 
  contrary to most predictions , the conservatives ( epp ) narrowly topped the social democrats . 
  social security fraud is quite different from bona fide migration . 
  limiting fraud by restricting migration is like chopping a limb because of an in-grown nail . 
  also , after catastrophic failures of all far-left experiments in the past century . 
  more like ussr . 
  there were different nations there , but a single olympic team . 
  you did n't get the point . 
  even during holodomor in ukraine there were those who were well-fed . 
  cleverness , pretty close . 
  no , it 's not about grit or perseverance , but about ability to find solutions quickly . 
  i would translate \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430 as smartness . 
  \u0421\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0438 ( sutki ) in russian , para in lithuanian . 
  looks like a lot of languages have this word for 24 hours that english lacks . 
  the lithuanian version is `` why did germany attack the soviet union '' . 
  a bit harder to answer , huh ? 
  because it 's too far north is my guess . 
  even in lithuania you need a really warm summer for corn to ripen . 
  is n't ferrari a part of the fiat group ? 
  heh , still too early to say , we might still have winter until may . 
  a lot of our local commentators would agree with the minister . 
  the municipal government of kaunas in particular complains that these spasms from the lithuanian government are messing up strategic development plans for the region that have been laid out 15 years ago and have depended upon in many projects . 
  the thing is , the international gauge is already practically reaching kaunas , and it was always obvious that rail baltica via kaunas makes more economic sense . 
  ** lithuania ** * as joining the eurozone starting next year becomes feasible for the first time since we joined the eu 10 years ago , populist politicians started questioning if we need to accept the euro now , stirring rubbish fud that poor people will become poorer . 
  * widespread gloating over [ yuliya yefimova 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuliya_yefimova ) failed doping test , if she ends up disqualified , [ r\u016bta meilutyt\u0117 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c5%abta_meilutyt%c4%97 ) will have another gold medal . 
  * last week a mayor of a predominantly polish county was fined over $ 13000 for failing to execute a court ruling for over a year ( 100 lt , $ 29 per day ) . 
  the ruling obliged him to remove polish street plaques which violate the state language law . 
  because of this members of the polish election campaign walked out during the commemoration of the [ 13 of january , 1991 events ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_%28lithuania%29 ) in the parliament . 
  next day , the leader of the polish election campaign valdemar toma\u0161evski claimed during an ep session that the enthic minorities in lithuania are persecuted for their use of their native language . 
  lithuanian president dalia grybauskait\u0117 replied that `` no organisation has ruled that lithuania violates international norms for the protection of national minorities . '', 
  turning in particular to valdemar tomasevski , the mep from lithuanian 's ethnic polish party , she said `` your personal target is the discrediting of lithuania both inside the house and internationally '' . 
  [ bbc transcript ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/europe-25717211 ) . 
  this ca n't be serious . 
  more than anything , it looks like a provocation by anti-gay elements to give gay bashers a rationalization to bash gays and putin to say `` leave the children alone '' . 
  yes , essentially they are hacker student projects with a modest academic funding and a huge national hype . 
  come on , it costs about the price of an executive car to build and launch a cubesat . 
  on the one hand , you can compare them to sputnik by their function ( several microcontrollers , an inertial navigation system , a camera , several radios ) , on the other hand putting sputnik into orbit was an incomparably greater achievement compared to a commercial cubesat deployment , which is almost a commodity . 
  just like massachussian or idahian is not a nationality , german or slovenian is . 
  the eu citizen identity is something beside our nationality . 
  1 ) eu aid substantially boosts the economy of my country . 
  the effect is hard to ignore . 
  roads , capital investments in high-tech businesses , brand new equipment for farmers , and so on and so forth , around 30 % of gdp . 
  2 ) large open market . 
  i can buy stuff from , say , uk , and it is not subject to any duties , whatever the value . 
  3 ) eu regulation in many areas of life ensures that the interests of the public and of the consumers will be protected , even where local officials could not be trusted . 
  4 ) as everyone noted , free travel and common currency ( mostly ) . 
  5 ) this !, 
  a feeling of community among the many nations of this small subcontinent . 
  i guess the eu presidency ( july through december ) was the biggest event in lithuania this year . 
  it 's been a busy time for the bureaucrats , and apparently they 've done a competent job , even though they were n't able to claim the ukraine 's association agreement signing in vilnius . 
  the whole capital got a brush up for the arrival of the euro-bureaucrats , some streets got re-paved , the rebuilt ducal palace completed . 
  it 's highly debatable if it 's worth having a free-floating currency for such a small economy . 
  ~ 0.4 % of the eu in gdp ppp , or about 50 times smaller than germany . 
  why should n't he ? 
  time and again , being in the erm ii , we are already bearing the share of the eurozone problems , without having all of the benefits . 
  the greek * state * did not just spring into being out of nothing in 1800s , greece has history that predates the concept of a nation-state by centuries . 
  do a road trip , i 'm sure it would help !, 
  the population would be comprised of 40 % lithuanians , 20 % latvians , and more russians than estonians .
