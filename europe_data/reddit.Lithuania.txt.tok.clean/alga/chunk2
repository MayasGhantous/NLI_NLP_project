  well , funny that you put greece there :-), 
  would you say that any state-sponsored television can not be objective in covering the affairs of said state ? 
  i would expect that the `` national '' tv , being less dependent on advertisers is more objective overall . 
   first country to recognize latvia as an independent country after the collapse of ussr and lithuania too !, 
  more than 6 months ahead of usa . 
  wtf ? 
  maskirovka is simply a russian word for camouflage , it 's more related to masking than masquerade . 
  when such a glaring error appears in the first sentence , is it even worth spending time on the report ? 
  only basel is not in an eu country !, 
  t\u0117vyn\u0117s s\u0105junga is not far right , it 's a pretty conventional christian democrat right . 
  the union of nationalist parties ( nacionalinis susivienijimas \u201e u\u017e lietuv\u0105 lietuvoje `` ) gathered just under 1 % of the vote during the last election . 
  the all-out neonazi movements are outside national politics altogether . 
  ** lithuania ** i 'll just describe the parties that have seats in the parliament , the others are barely relevant . 
  religious , socially conservative , pro business , quite nationalist , anti-communist , anti-russian . 
  an old , established political force with a dedicated voter base . 
  ** lsdp ** -- social democrats by name . 
  former communists by nature . 
  home to some shocking remnants from the soviet regime . 
  cronyist in governance style . 
  often pandering to the poorest demographic . 
  often socially conservative , despite the title . 
  got most seats during the last election . 
  a party organized and held together by a successful ethnic russian businessman . 
  the party and its leadership is practically implicated in financial fraud , court cases dragging on for almost a decade . 
  no particular political or economical ideology . 
  driven just by populism and the leader 's charisma . 
  upd : causes vote buying suspicions every damn time . 
  ** liberal\u0173 s\u0105j\u016bdis / liberals ** -- mostly young , bright people with a lot of common sense and a bit too much free market neocon ideology . 
  cleanest reputation . 
  ** dr\u0105sos kelias ** -- opportunist clowns who managed to rally some loonie following around a notorious polarizing criminal case and squeezed over the minimum limit . 
  the leader is in the hiding , being sought by the law enforcement on said case . 
  ** tvarka ir teisingumas / order and justice ** -- pathetic populists employing too many nazi allusions in their pr . 
  spineless centrists despite that . 
  the leader is the only impeached president in europe . 
  he 's fighting his ban from elected positions in the court of human rights . 
  ** lietuvos lenk\u0173 rinkim\u0173 akcija / the polish electoral campaign ** -- the representatives of the polish ethnic minority in the vilnius region . 
  in order to remain relevant , they escalate ethnic friction instead of helping the minorities . 
  the leader seems to align himself with putin 's russia more than with poland . 
  a permanent fixture in the parliament , sometimes part of the coalition . 
  the only noteworthy party that did n't pass the cutoff is farmers + greens . 
  we got a guy with british citizenship elected to city council in vilnius , lithuania !, 
  there are other angles to look at the situation from . 
  have you seen [ this article ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/6/30/8868363/greece-crisis-default-austerity ) ? 
  also , predominantly young . 
  oh , the baltics are doing pretty well these days . 
  jesus , it looks as if someone faked their architecture diploma . 
  or they held a contest in a kindergarten and painted a house based on the winning design . 
  at least here it 's possible to survive feeding on 1.5 $ a day , eating things like pasta , porridge , beans , potatos . 
  in lithuanian ' \u0161ukuoti ' means ` to comb ' . 
  the kids replying in unison are cute . 
  participation in the holocaust . 
  sorry , i guess you were referring to the 2015 entry , and i meant the 2016 one . 
  you 're missing the point of eurovision . 
  90 % of the songs there are mediocre and boring , but the point of the show is over-the-top , eccentric , grotesque circus , and this entry had plenty of that !, 
  me too !, 
  here in lithuania prisma is the tidiest supermarket chain , perhaps because they 're still relatively new . 
  plus , store brand goods are way above the level of other chains . 
  like frozen croissants actually made in france . 
  it 's just a bit different , more confectionery-like . 
   giving it to the poor is proven ineffective . 
  how about hiring more university professors to provide the kids of the poor with proper education ? 
  and hiring more medical doctors to provide everyone with decent health care ? 
  also , good public infrastructure , subsidies for fast internet in remote places , etc , etc ? 
   eu is n't completely undemocratic it 's democratic alright . 
  governments are not elected by popular vote either , the council and the commission are just extensions of the same principle to the supranational level . 
   if scandinavia was one country , we would be nearly self sufficient . 
  but where would you take your coffee from , huh ? 
  do you think you could function without it ? 
  it 's a well-understood fact that ts-lkd is a split-mind party , with a religious , nationalist , anti-abortion , anti-gay-rights wing , and a right-wing technocrat wing . 
  during this campaign the 've emphasized their young , competent technocrat wing , there was absolutely no social-conservative rhetoric . 
  their proposed cabinet is made up entirely of invited competent technocrats and members of their more liberal wing . 
  so there is hope that they will be able to reel in their taliban in actual policymaking like they have in their campaign . 
  myself , i 'm still voting lrls to help gentvilas and , hopefully , a few of his young colleagues promoted by the preference votes , pass the 5 % barrier . 
  lsdp are still dominated by their commies , with soviet ethic and governance style , and they have not been forthcoming in promoting their newer generation , and they have kept the several smart people they have among them well hidden . 
  so it 's not yet time to vote for them . 
  as far as economic policy goes , i think neither major party would do anything drastic to the level of welfare and income redistribution we have now , so ideology should have less weight in choosing than competence and reputation . 
  the difference is that a kimono is specifically a japanese item of clothing , whereas steam baths exist in many cultures from ancient times , and many north-eastern european nations have their own variations of saunas not unlike finnish ones , called different names : pirtis and pirts in lithuanian and latvian respectively , \u0431\u0430\u043d\u044f ( banya ) in russian , \u043b\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044f ( laznya ) in ukrainian and belarussian . 
  more like `` peeg smocked '' . 
  i guess it must be mentioned that it 's an ad of the same burger joint that had the mural of trump and putin kissing on its wall . 
  also they had a controversial facebook ad with pages of the bible used to wipe off spilt sauce or something like that as a response to paris shooting . 
  notorious for risqu\u00e9 pr . 
  it 's just a common indoeuropean root coming from the common ancestral protoindoeuropean language . 
  in sanskrit , there is `` dhuma '' ( cf. 
  it makes sense . 
  cmd - # . 
  the hash sign is looks kind of like a photo as a mnemonic . 
  it fixed has become !, 
  but the plural `` you '' as the second person singular is fair game !, 
  a useful mnemonic is that they are sorted in alphabetical order from top to bottom . 
  well , there are millions of brits living abroad . 
  and close to a million german citizens living outside germany . 
  emigration does not automatically mean economic hardship . 
  and all the services : dentists , taxis , transport in general , hairdressers , plumbers , computer technicians , insurance agants , internet and mobile subscriptions , etc. 
  i guess what 's newsworthy here is that this narrative has become relevant to the us . 
  our _ friends _ from the east have a handy term `` pribalts '' ;-), 
  did you mean ` eww ' ? 
  cause that 's somewhat close . 
  also , reddit is a social filter with a higher representation of young , educated part of the population . 
  seems like czech has peculiar pronunciation . 
  and slovak is said to be pretty central in the slavic language family , so it 's about as intelligible for croats as it is to russians , not to speak of polish !,
