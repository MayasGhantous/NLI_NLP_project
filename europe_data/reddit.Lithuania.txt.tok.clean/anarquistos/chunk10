  so cahors became kagor . 
  it also explains why almost all brands of kagor show churches or [ christ ] ( http://www.rebelimport.com/companiesdisplayed/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/kagor-blagovest.png ) , or other religious [ symbolism ] ( http://ei.isnooth.com/multimedia/7/2/e/image_2133399_full.jpeg ) . 
  christianisation of lithuania was just a matter of time . 
  king mindaugas , got baptised in 1250 or 1251 before he accepted the crown in 1253 . 
  but he was murdered in 1263 in a power struggle and once again we returned officially to being a pagan state . 
  grand duke gediminas already had churches built in 1330-ies . 
  in his letters to western rulers , in 1320-ies he said that we will accept christianity once you will stop pushing it with a sword . 
  the real question was who will we accept christianity from - orthodox christianity from the eastern parts of the dutchy , or catholicism from poland or germans . 
  since we were at war with the teutonic and livonian orders that was out of the question . 
  the the territories in the south east were mostly under control and russian duchies did not seem to be either strong opponents or valuable allies . 
  so the logical solution was to accept christianity from poland and gain an ally . 
  that being said christianity did not firmly take root for several centuries ( at least among the common folk ) . 
  most of our festivals still have a lot of pagan traditions , symbolism and lore about them . 
  tl ; dr lithuanians knew where to get christianity , and did not need anyone to give it to them . 
  poland just had the best thing to offer in return . 
  never underestimate the stupidity of powerfull people . 
  therefore the analogy is even more fitting . 
  no one is ready for this shit as well . 
  you know , just give them what they want and surely they will stop . 
  it 's the only way to secure [ peace in our time ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/munichagreement_.jpg ) . 
  euromaidan pr just tweeted : #parubiy : if #russian military forces start active actions , #ukrainian border guards will respond adequately - espreso.tv | pr #news, 
  yeah , the first one was better in my opinion as well . 
  herring , when we get hung over . 
  or even better viru valge vodka . 
  ( it translates almost dirrectly in to lithuanian for men 's food - vyr\u0173 valgis ) . 
  you bring the bread , i bring the beer , and we can be wasted all thru the year !, 
  lithuania big , lithuania stronk !, 
  lots of historic buthurt i 'm guessing . 
  a lot of people in the former eastern block countries remember the soviet times as the good old days . 
  sites like englishrussia enforce this illusion with carefully selected cheerful and optimistic photos from those times . 
  however the reality was much more prosaic . 
  this is an album that shows the grittier and dirtier side of life back then . 
  the right way to put it would be `` should uk cut immigration and accept lower growth '' . 
  somalia and yemen are on the gate to africa and the arabian peninsula from asia and the rest of the world , but it does not do much good for them . 
  oh and if you are like to have documentaries playing in the background when redditing here is an entertaining piece by m. firiedman about hong kong 's economic miracle http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1fj5tzuybe, 
  economic research would like to have word with you in a dark alley : http://www.nber.org/chapters/c11011.pdf http://gwulo.com/node/6190 http://www.iedm.org/files/note1113_en.pdf tl ; dr they make stuff and offer useful services . 
  besides singapore is not close to china , and they are rich as fuck . 
  nope , doing business index that measures economic freedom : hong kong # 1 singapore # 2 . 
  well hong kong was not a heavily urbanized area before starting free market reforms . 
  neither was singapore , or any of the `` tiger '' economies in asia . 
  most of them were just fishing villages and backwaters in the world economics . 
  and then there were plenty of people starving in these countries before significant liberalization , but i do n't think there are many who are starving now . 
  part of the beauty of free markets is that the capital does not stay in the same hands for long if it is not constantly invested and used for research and innovation . 
  if money is not invested and used in new production it just get 's eaten up . 
  same as with kids from rich families , who just use up all their inherited money and do not create anything productive . 
  and besides income inequality and distribution is an almost useless point of statistics . 
  being 90 % poorer than the millionaire next door still means that you live a decently comfortable life . 
  i would rather have that , than earning exactly as much as the richest person in the country , when you both are on the brink of starvation . 
  ethiopia , niger and pakistan have equal income distribution indexes as countries like canada or [ australia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:world_income_gini_map_%282013%29.svg ) . 
  there is an old joke about the old ussr - `` everyone was equal - nobody had anything . '', 
  for me it 's hard to think of an example of a country ruined by free markets , where people who used to be in the upper middle class now starve to death , because the rich have concentrated all the capital in their hands . 
  history shows plenty of examples though where trying to make everyone equal has led to disasters . 
  one bad example of capitalism gone wrong ( or going wrong ) could be the usa , but that is because of crony capitalism , lobbying and an overreaching and pretentious government , that just has massive amount of money created by a working and developed market . 
  but that is no fault of capitalism , it 's just that in a rich country stupid and evil people in the government can do much more harm . 
  damn , that quote is good . 
  yap , and hong kong was successful precisely because of pro-market reforms . 
  china is even emulating hong kong in cities like shanghai and gouangzhou by establishing special economic zones . 
  another case where economic freedom = prosperity . 
  hong kong , singapore , switzerland , even the less communist by the day china have risen from rags to riches by freeing up the market , reducing taxes , bureaucracy and regulations . 
  dozens of practical examples show that this is the fastest way of ending recessions and poverty . 
  however it is incredibly hard to be popular by using pro-market arguments both in general political discussions and in this subreddit . 
  why is this the case , fellow europeans ? 
  do we no longer believe , that freedom leads to prosperity ? 
  what are your thoughts on cases like georgia ? 
  yes , yes it is !, 
  on higher dosages it works as a laxative too !, 
  my guess is that it 's for the movie and for the mineral [ water ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nitlob098w8 ) . 
  or `` gezai '' and `` marozai '' here in lithuania . 
  yes i think it is a viral campaign for two things . 
  one is the movie `` redirected '' , another is for the mineral water `` vytautas '' . 
  you can even find other commercials for it in the uploader 's channel . 
  they are pretty [ awesome ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nitlob098w8 ) though . 
  i think that is a natural thing for such people . 
  you know , you do n't expect a guy to talk about something as natural as breathing . 
  it feels bad that this happened , and especially in a store owned by a lithuanian company ... 
  well if they would have cough up to the fact fast enough , they could still catch the bus to kaunas . 
  it 's like a for hour bus ride from one place to the other . 
  go go , friendly , peaceful neighbors !, 
  no geography is too different , they had a large , long , unpopulated and uncivilized , fortified , densely forested boarder . 
  ours is long , with good infrastructure , flat and and hardly defended at all . 
  plus we have russia on two sides ( kaliningrad and the puput state of lukashenka ) . 
  at 60 km/h tanks could be a ` rollin thru the place i 'm typing this comment in less than an hour . 
  nah , that is so 2008 ... 
  they need to spice thing up a bit this time , so a new target would be logical . 
  dam some times i wish we had a swiss style army in here , that is probably the only reasonable defense strategy for a small country , with a big angry bear on the boarders . 
  i wonder who could they invade ? 
  i bet somewhere that sits just on the border , is close to the west , is disliked by the majority of the population , but is not relevant enough for nato to interfere ... help !, 
  same amount of factory workers here . 
  the reason why the resistance was much stronger in lithuania is that most of the partisans were former members of the military . 
  no volunteer ss batalions were formed in lithuania , so most of the fighting aged men did not get killed of during the ww2 , and most even managed to maintain their pre-war weapons and even some of the uniforms . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:adolfas_ramanauskas-vanagas.jpg ) you can see the leader o lithuanian partisans in his independance period army uniform . 
  basically the russians were fighting a guerrilla war with normal , well trained army regiments , supported by the local population . 
  also we were always just more stubborn ( and violent ) than our neighbors to the north . 
   it 's do with the tobacco companies advertising them as the ` healthier ' option . 
  is n't advertizing of tobacco products illegal in any way shape or form in eu already ? 
  i do n't think anybody could get away with advertizing any type of tobacco as a `` healthier '' thing in this century . 
  its just a vice that people enjoy , and everyone knows it is not healthy . 
  problem is that younger people sometimes prefer the minty smokes , and everyone assumes that they get hooked on them and continue to stronger cigarettes . 
  kind of a gateway drug argument . 
  we remove kebab ?
