  no oil , coal or gas reserves ( only shale oil , but fracking is controversial and as of the moment not done ) . 
  we have moderate deposits of clay , peat and some iron ore ( also not exploited ) . 
  hell in lithuania we do not even have rocks or cliffs of any kind . 
  so no surprise that traditionally the countries were agricultural or focused on fishing/woodcutting . 
  my guess is - very infertile soil ( mostly sand ) , and no other resources other than wood . 
  so other then the few port cities ( liepaja and ventspils ) there just is n't much to do in the economical sense . 
  i love the nature there , but the place is really empty . 
  no wonder i like kurzeme on the west coast of latvia - it is almost as densely populated as a desert . 
  [ chaos reigns .

   dog = bub bub wtf , lmao . 
  i just think that they say `` vai !, 
  although that is not the only noise they make . 
   how can you be a christian when you do n't take the bible literally ? 
  i 'm not much of a christian myself , but that is not true . 
  christians are only supposed to take the new testament literaly , and even then they are to do it with the guidance of the church . 
  catholics are supposed to take the words of the vatican literaly , and the only valid interpretation of holy scripture come from the church . 
  if the pope gives thumbs up to doing it in the butt , then all good catholics are supposed to follow , no matter what the old testament says . 
  that is why noone bothered translating the bible from latin to local languages and even then erasmus of roterdam had to spill a lot of ink arguing why it should be translated and available to common folk . 
  now protestants take the bible more seriously , but even they mostly concentrate on the new testament , and most pastors are rather wordly and sane people . 
  and finaly you have the extreme baptists and anabaptists . 
  thats the crazy part of protestants . 
  they take everything that is written in the bible literaly . 
  if buggery is haram , then they say that sodomites shall burn in hell . 
  if there is a story about about a guy sowing his seed on baren land , then when you choke your chicken you are literraly giving satan the handshake . 
  that 's people like westboro baptist church and branch davidians . 
  they are the only ones taking the bible literaly . 
  candle makers claim that electric light is unfair competition . 
  figured this much . 
  anything interesting in the rest of it ? 
  what does it say ? 
   inflation is the amount of money being spent . 
  in \u00b7 fla \u00b7 tion in\u02c8fl\u0101sh ( \u0259 ) n / noun noun : inflation 2 . 
  economics a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money . 
  consumer prices are stagnant because of the decrease of oil prices . 
  housing market on the other hand is rising and fast . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/graph.do?tab=graph&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teicp270&amp;language=en&amp;toolbox=data that is a 8 % increase in two years . 
  the total volume of all executed transactions in a given time period ( i.e. 
  the amount of money being spent ) is called turnover . 
  central banks print money creating inflation . 
  savings get devalued , loans get cheaper . 
  cheaper loans lead to higher prices ( real estate most of all ) . 
  poor people can not save up ( for example for the downpayment for the apartment ) and are forced to take a long term ( 30-40 ) mortgage on their house . 
  due to abundant loans caused real estate prices are sky high . 
  people get stuck in the same job and are afraid of looking for something better since they can not afford a month of unemployment . 
  viscious cycle of poverty . 
  you made my astral vagina wet . 
   ** burn down ** the yacht , the shipyard and ** the russian billionaire ** what does that mean then ? 
  what were you suggesting to do with him ? 
   are you high ? 
  no , but i wish i was . 
  does that count ? 
  doing the same in a country that is not a mafia state where companies are literally awarded to the friends of the ruling elite and exist only due to the local government eliminating all competition . 
  capitalism is built on respect for property rights . 
  there is none of that in russia if you do not have the right connections . 
  there is no boundary between the state and the mafia , and the way most of the oligarchs got their factories and businesses is by literally taking them over by force , with the blessing of the local politicians . 
  then they proceeded to kill , threaten and extort all of their competitors out of existence . 
  so that is just a continuation of communist nepotism . 
  highly immoral capitalist pigs are still morally superior to communists . 
  your suggestion to burn down a yacht full of rare materials , that cost a fortune and replacing which would damage the environment enormously shows your lack of concern for both the labor of other people and the environment . 
  your suggestion to burn a live human being with no regard proportional punishment , no fair trial , suggest a disregard for human life , suffering and justice that communists and communist regimes typically show . 
  so i do n't think that you are in a position to moralize someone . 
  nope . 
  do you have any more info on that ? 
  that would be a really interesting read , since egalitarian , literate societies in the 18-th century are a rarity . 
  wikipedia articles only talk about wars in 18-th century and mention that during konbaung dynasty times ( 1752 to 1885 ) society was highly stratified . 
  for example i found this quote interesting :  during the konbaung dynasty , burmese society was highly stratified . 
  loosely modelled on the four hindu varnas , konbaung society was divided into four general social classes by descent . 
   for instance , sumptuary laws forbade ordinary burmese subjects to build houses of stone or brick and dictated the number of tiers on the ornamental spired roof ( called pyatthat ) allowed above one 's residence -- the royal palace 's great audience hall and the 4 main gates of the royal capital , as well as monasteries , were allowed 9 tiers while those of the most powerful tributary princes ( sawbwa ) were permitted 7 , at most . 
  [ 101 ] [ 102 ]  sumptuary laws ordained 5 types of funerals and rites accorded to each : the king , royal family members , holders of ministerial offices , merchants and those who possessed titles , and peasants ( who received no rites at death ), 
  i think the author uses `` balts '' as a shorthand for `` people from the baltic states '' with no ethnic implications . 
  and like it or not `` baltic states `` is a popular and useful classification . 
  oh yes , a billionaire from a formerly communist country that is notorious for corruption and misuse of public funds buying illegally logged wood from a state run company in myanmar which was a socialist military dictatorship until 2011 is surely the fault of capitalism !, 
  pikachu , i choose something that costs less than you !, 
  gaaaaaaaay !, 
  [ our friendly neighbors reaction . 
  sorry , just a honest shitpost from me . 
  the clock stays the same , but the hours of the day you go to work on get changed . 
  the problem is that working hours do get changed , and useful daylight is not maximized . 
  long , official , pedantic , no soul and human warmth . 
  basically a confirmation of all stereotypes . 
  that was the most german thing i have ever read . 
   there is a documented decrese in accidents during dst statements like this usually have to be followed by links to some sort of source . 
   not to mention the tangible health benefits of synching sleep patterns to sunlight that could make sense in the south . 
  where i live in midwinter the day is 7 hours long . 
  the sun is sort of up from 09:39 to 16:53 . 
  and what is left of the day is best described as twilight . 
  if you are working any sort of desk job , you have your light on all day long basically from november to march . 
  adding or subtracting an hour from either end does absolutely nothing positive . 
  in summer it can be light enough to read without a lamp from 6 to 21 . 
  and the days get longer so fast that in two weeks from switching to summer time there the day is longer by a full hour . 
  in a month the day is almost 15 hours long . 
  i agree that it is useful and healthy to adjust to daylight , however the best way to do it is just to adapt the local working hours to the real timezone , and not mess around with clocks every six months . 
  yes and i eat babies to . 
  unvaccinated babies , i like my food organic and with measles , you see . 
  work starts whenever you and your employer agree to . 
  my work usually starts at around 16 h . however there is an objective reason why midday and midnight are in place . 
  for example if you are in your proper time zone and have a analog clock , if you can see the sun you can always find north and south . 
  might sound like redundant knowledge , but i used this trick once when i strayed from the edge of the tourist map in brussels . 
  it helped me get my ass out of a very unfriendly neighborhood .
