  there 's plenty of ideas for that like the basic income or the guaranteed work programs , etc. . . 
  it 's the lack of capacity for production is what worries me . 
  import :  bring ( goods or services ) into a country from abroad for sale . 
  `` japan 's reluctance to import more cars '', 
  no , they have n't . 
  they 're all for palestine and for all kinds of other `` exotic people '' and their homelands . 
  just not us . 
   who oppose equal rights , immigration , free trade and much of what supposedly defines us as a nation . 
  those three things are literally the opposite of what america stood for between 1776-1960 . 
  your politicians are starting to rewrite history it seems ... 
  there is no such thing as `` civic nationalism '' ... https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5412b0/european_politics_are_swinging_to_the_right/d7yoil5, 
   nationalism leads to apathy with leads to us vs them mentality which leads to war . 
  yeah , that 's why east asia is so war-like these days , and why africa with all of its ethnic/religious diversity under single nation-states are the most peaceful ... ethnic/religious conflicts have killed probably 10x the number of people than national sovereignty ever did . 
   civic nationalism is a relatively new term that may provide the best solution so far , inasmuch as it is a non-xenophobic and non-ethnic kind of nationalism civic nationalism is an oxymoron . 
  nationalism without an ethnic or racial dimension is not really nationalism . 
  national identity implies ** continuity ** . 
  importing masses of alien races who promise to learn our language and contribute economically does not really contribute to the continuity aspect of our nation . 
  what would make this current generation connect to the generation 500 years ago ? 
  nothing . 
  so how is that a nation and not just a piece of land with imaginary borders ? 
  nationalism is about putting yourself and seeing yourself as part of some great historic project . 
  civic nationalism does not build history . 
  at best , it 's a political strategy to build cohesion among its subjects for `` smoother '' economic transactions between them . 
  nothing else . 
   no , they do n't , and we should all finally get rid of this outdated early 19th century national romantic ideal and perception of identity development . 
  outdated ? 
  there were less than 80 nations on this planet back in the 1950 . 
  today there are over 200 . 
  and judging by what 's happening in other regions of the world : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_separatist_movements_in_africa https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_separatist_movements_in_asia that number ** will ** only increase . 
  you people do appear to support nationalism , just not for europeans it seems ...  nationalism does not occur naturally or spontaneously . 
  it is not a natural phenomenon . 
  nationalism is natural and can be explained biologically by recognizing that tribalism is in human dna . 
  humans are tribal . 
  have been tribal since the dawn of time . 
  those with `` less advanced '' tribalism simply have been replaced by those with `` more advanced '' tribalism in their lands . 
  that is the history of humanity . 
  so nationalism really is just an extension of tribalism . 
  `` religious tribalism '' if you want to see it that way . 
   but it is harmful even if you look aside from genocides and world wars til european history exists only from 1919-1945 ...  in reality , nationalism is the opium of the people and the unnecessary drm of cultural identity . 
  yes yes ... it 's a disease , a pathology , a form of `` supremacy '' , a phobia ... all those things but only if the europeans do it !, 
  why the double standard ? 
   almost never by the rainbow spectrum of cultures , values , and norms , often living side by side and interacting with one another within the same pluricultural individual . 
  multiculturalist society is an oxymoron . 
   nationalism is good for the people in power , not the people subject to power . 
  you could say the same about your `` one world government '' utopia . 
  this is no different from muslims wanting a worldwide caliphate . 
   we need to get out of this massive case of collective stockholm syndrome as soon as possible because it actually hinders us from delivering the right solutions to problems at this point . 
  how is us choosing to exist on our own lands , `` hinders the progress of mankind '' ? 
  why must we go extinct for your utopia to become true ? 
  what kind of logic is this . 
  you people seriously think that the rest of the world are just holding hands in peace and it 's just us evil europeans ( < 10 % of planet 's population ) that are the standing in the way of this global peace and prosperity ... 
   and if you think ireland is a tax heaven you are welcome ( unlike our neighbours across the little pond were are a fairly welcoming bunch i 'm pretty sure at this point ireland has more companies than people . 
  so what does that make you , then ? 
  vast majority of your companies are n't locally owned . 
  vast majority of your corporate tax revenue is n't from irish-based firms . 
  if it looks like a duck , swims like a duck ... 
  how the hell would importing africans into germany create more beaches or better climate ? 
  geography can not be changed . 
  why not just move all businesses to singapore at this point ? 
  let the middle classes of the west pay all the taxes . 
  and let businesses pay next to nothing in some tax haven while being allowed to sell their products back to us through `` free trade '' . 
  is that the end game here ? 
  great ... europe is just becoming canada 2.0 . 
  sell of the whole continent for some useless euros . 
  this is just lebensraum through economics . 
  how the hell do they even survive in germany ? 
  i 'm assuming it 's illegal to hire persons who do n't have citizenship or some sort of permanent residency permit ? 
  so what the hell . 
  i 'm pretty sure i could n't survive in china for more than a week if i just walked in with no money and no papers . 
  oh dear god ... and let me guess , they 're going north , not south ? 
  why does n't turkey just split up ? 
  you could literally solve most of the problems in middle east/african regions by just redrawing the map . 
  why is no one trying to do that ? 
  putting all turks in germany wo n't solve turkey 's problems . 
  but we already have a brazil ... your `` master race '' utopia of superior mixed-race people already exists . 
  the world does not need two brazils . 
  there are so many better ways to raise or birth rates . . why is every eastern european politician going on about this by banning abortion ?? 
  we need cultural changes . 
  forcing more unwanted children is barely better than no children . 
  we actually need people to start wanting children . 
  banning abortion wo n't change that . 
  why ca n't they understand that ? 
  no , which is why they should just start thinking about secession . 
  most of the electorate by 2022 wo n't even be french at that point . 
  so why should they even get to vote on other people 's future ? 
  this is so stupid . 
  hungary needs babies , not `` foreign workers '' . 
  no amount of syrians , chinese , vietnamese , sudanese raise birth rates of hungarians . 
  there are more cats/dogs in most european countries , than children . 
  how the hell would importing foreign workers from turkey change this sad state of our culture ??? 
  no one ever has an explanation . 
   there 's no need to learn from history , just keep repeating it . 
  one day it will certainly work . 
  that 's ironic ... germany literally controls more of europe these days than hitler ever dreamed of ... 
  this is such a nonsense poll . 
  if by `` secular laws '' , they mean this leftist social justice `` equality '' nonsense , then i reject those too . 
  am i a radical now too along with all those muslims ? 
  apparently so ... 
  probably a third of actual french people reject those `` secular values '' too . 
  and probably over 90 % of all french people who have ever lived would reject them too .
