  identity without continuity is just a personality . 
  eu has weakened europe . 
  that 's why everyone wants to leave . 
  what asians are you talking about ? 
  and how have they `` assimilated '' ? 
  what have they ** assimilated into ** ? 
  this `` assimilation '' is so superficial though . 
  learning the language , paying taxes , and watching the same tv shows wo n't make you german . 
  when i think of assimilation , i think of assimilation ** into a people ** . 
  not into an economy or some transient cultural norms . 
  by that logic , i 'm am english because i speak almost perfect english and watch doctor who every week even though i 've only been to england once in my lifetime and only for 6 days . 
  why not ? 
  you ca n't just replace all the germans with german-speaking `` new germans '' and expect german people to remain a great `` historic people '' as they 've been for thousands of years without `` german '' itself becoming meaningless and without any sense of history or culture . 
  this is what 's happening now . 
  germany is being redefined , and continuity is being lost . 
  germany is now an economic organization . 
  because values of an institution or even a country come and go every generation anyways . 
  you think `` european values '' were the same for europe just 50 years ago ? 
  european people are 30,000 years old , there 's been all sorts of `` values '' and `` systems '' throughout all that history . 
  you 've been a liberal/democrat/socialist / whatever for maybe 30 years , but you 've been british for thousands of years . 
  that 's the point here . 
  defining yourself by some transient values is idiotic . 
   but what is `` european '' ? 
  a people , race , history ... 
  why ca n't these people separate europe from the ** european union ** ?!?!, 
  england is still part of europe !!, 
  has been for thousands and thousands of years !, 
  nothing has changed here apart from removing a political institution that is slowly destroying this continent . 
  i do n't think most people give a shit what religions they follow . 
  they could be scientologists for all i care . 
  they 're non-europeans , that is where most people have an issue . 
  europe already has demographic issues as it is . 
  so eu and its `` progressive culture '' has made romania lose more people in a year than they lost during the last two world wars combined ... think about that . 
  yeah , that did n't come with the statue ... this was added like 20 years later . 
   economic growth . 
  you mean ** gdp growth ** ? 
  larger economy by itself helps no one . 
  mexico has a much larger economy than switzerland . 
  but would you rather live in mexico or switzerland ? 
  this would make sense . 
  united states + canada + australia probably has more english ( partially or fully ) people than all of uk combined . 
  there should be some sort of laws on the book anyways to make it easy for all that `` english diaspora '' to come back to their homeland . 
  why import pakistanis when you have something like ~ 30 million english people to choose from right across the ocean ... 
  half of germany are already retirees . 
  another quarter are foreigners from decades before . 
  and that remaining german quarter has the lowest birth rates on the planet . 
  that 0.3 % percent is actually like 10 % once you factor in all the `` family reunification '' in the upcoming years . 
  my god ... have n't the germans suffered enough already ? 
  these are the native peoples resisting their dispossession . 
  how is that nazism ? 
  they 're not trying to conquer foreign territories or foreign people . 
  i bet the real nazis are getting pissed off at everything being compared to nazism these days ... 
  i never understood why those groups never play the indigenous angle ... that 's what i would use in my country . 
  opposing everything without supporting something wo n't work . 
  just say that this land belongs to its indigenous peoples . 
  i do n't see how the far-left could possibly argue against that ... 
  good . 
  as if our product shelves are n't foreign enough already ... you know , you ca n't base an economy entirely on bureaucracy and debt , right ? 
  i 've been a european for thousands of years . 
  some of those `` europeans '' have been european since 1990s ... oh , but they speak german !, 
  that means they 're just as german as germans !, 
   i can complain about the us a lot , but here is something the us gets right - you were born in the us and lived in the us all your life , brought up with us values , you 're american but has that made you into a ** native american ? 
  ** you know , cherokee , sioux , navajo ... why not ? 
  you were born in the same place as them , you lived in the same place as them ... oh wait , ethnicity has nothing to do with geography . 
  and neither does your `` personality '' . 
  so why would it be different with germans and arabs for example ? 
  you people understand this completely when this logic is applied to a more exotic people . 
  they 're ** in ** europe , but they 're not ** of ** europe . 
  birth place has nothing to do with it . 
  there 's people being born on international waters everyday . 
  what does that make them ? 
  well obviously it matters to other groups otherwise they would n't demand more `` diversity '' which just means more of `` their people '' . 
  obviously it 's not just `` color '' to them . 
  it 's what goes with it . 
  it 's the same for people like me but in reverse . 
  they feel like foreigners among people `` not like them '' , and i would feel like a foreign among people who are not like me . 
   we can only identify as european , because of our values ( geographically speaking , europe is just a part of asia ) . 
  so people who do n't share these current values ( 95 % of europeans who are now dead ) and probably ~ 50 % of europeans who are alive today ( like me !, 
  ) , are n't european to you ? 
  i do n't even know what we 're arguing for here . 
  poland is looking very promising along with the rest of eastern europe excepts for their birth rates ... for poland it was [ 1.29 in 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_poland#after_ww_ii ) . 
  how the hell can it be so low ? 
  people during famines and black plague had more children that polish do now under a rapidly growing economy ... super-crowded and super-rich japan manages to have more children than poland . 
  so either those numbers are wrong or something crazy is happening within polish culture that i 'm not aware of . 
  european is not a `` personality '' and not some `` value system '' . 
  european is people . 
  we do n't exist for values , values exist for us . 
  i 'm european first , and an `` enlightened liberal '' second . 
  if the first part gets threatened by the second , then i should choose to get rid of the second , to save the first . 
  this is how i see it and it would n't be fair otherwise . 
  most of the people and national heroes 100 years ago did not share the same `` values '' as we do now . 
  are they still european ? 
  european `` roots '' are n't rooted in some arbitrary `` value system '' . 
   france is racially becoming more and more negroid , so much so that now one can actually speak of the creation of an african state on european soil . 
  if france develops along the lines it has taken in our day , and should that development continue for the next three hundred years , all traces of french blood will finally be submerged in the formation of a euro-african mulatto state . 
  no , you just have to be french . 
  that 's like saying you have to be asian to be chinese ... yes , all chinese are asians . 
  not all asians are chinese . 
  like are you pretending to not understand this or what ? 
  europe and europeans in general are much older than `` western society '' or `` liberalism '' .
