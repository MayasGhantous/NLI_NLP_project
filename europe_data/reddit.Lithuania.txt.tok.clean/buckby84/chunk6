  if you import a million africans , you have a million africans . 
  how can that be changed ? 
  if i was norway , i would n't import anyone from is not of northern european descent . 
  for fuck 's sake , they have entire america and canada to choose from full of tens of millions formerly nordic peoples who have a hard on for socialism and scandinavia in general . 
  why ca n't they import people from there instead ??? 
  just how dumb is their government ? 
   well feel free to share your solution then , i 'm curious to hear it . 
  i do n't know if this would work in my country , but it would definitely work in places like germany : nationalize all television/radio stations . 
  have them adopt something like this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motion_picture_production_code#don.27ts_and_be_carefuls you change the culture , slowly . 
  then start changing the cities by `` decentralizing '' the job places where people work . 
  no longer should the whole country be just one or two cities with insane cost of living where `` all the jobs are '' surrounded by dying villages in a countryside with no economic prospects and full of alcoholics . 
  that would also mean bye bye free trade . 
  we now buy from our own . 
  prices would go up , but wages would go up too . 
  that would provide economic stability and allow people to afford to live in more spacious settings away from hyper-urban cities where people have to compete for smallest apartments . 
  that plus culture would naturally make people 's lifestyle more family-oriented . 
  stability + space = higher birth rates . 
  it 's that simple . 
   did you know what you want to focus on when you were in your early teens or so ? 
  ugh ... vast majority of people do n't have their dream jobs , you know ? 
  they just take what they think they 'll be good at . 
   cultures indeed do change , but i doubt you could do that artificially . 
  politicians do not hold that kind of power in their hands . 
  nobody can fully control culture . 
  you can try to promote some values in a society , but the effect is uncertain at best . 
  yeah they do ... why do you think our culture is the way it is today ? 
  who did that ? 
  it did n't just come from the sky . 
  someone planned it this way . 
   people in free socities do not have to accept your message . 
  just recently italy tried to promote having more children by launching a `` fertility days '' campaign . 
  instead they got people angry because they did n't like that the state is telling them to have more kids in a situation when many young people struggle to even find a job . 
  that 's because people behind that campaign were idiots who do n't understand how propaganda works . 
  if people know that they 're consuming propaganda , propaganda does not work . 
  it needs to be subtle . 
  start inserting more `` family-like '' characters into popular tv shows . 
  start slowly banning sexual perversions like homosexuality , transsexualism and all that crap . 
  do what russia did - start banning porn sites by accusing them on corrupting and exploiting underage children or whatever excuse works ... there is so much you can do here , but they literally went the worst way possible . 
   those are still people being born . 
  yes . . but their birth rates have little to do with `` economic conditions '' of norway . 
  somalians have many children no matter where they 're at . 
  throwing money at native norwegians has n't worked at raising their birth rate is the point i 'm trying to make . 
   ethnicity does n't really matter : they 're norwegians as long as they have the citizenship and call themselves that . 
  well in that case norway should just have open borders and just let everyone in ... why bother ? 
  they can have a bunch of bureaucrats working day and night turning all the rainbow peoples on this planet into `` norwegians '' every day ... 
  what matters is the results , not language or feelings . 
  it 's like in that movie where a plane crashes on some remote mountain and they are forced to eat their friends or something to survive . 
  well ... in a way europe is in that same horrible situation . 
  we 're at a point where we 'll have to make some hard decisions . 
   also , all the factory robots in the world wo n't pay your pension . 
  it is if we own those robots ... 
  then let 's just start with africa and asia . 
  once those two are below 1 billion in population , then we 'll move on to europe ... 
  this literally means nothing . 
  we do n't exist for economics you know ? 
  let the robots make everything i do n't give a fuck . 
  whatever they make , we 'll just have the state redistribute it in forms of basic income to everyone in the country or whatever . 
  see how easy that was ??? 
  now can we stop the panic ?? 
  it 's about population of a people as a whole . 
  economics is secondary . 
  repatriation is a thing you know ... england would n't be the first country on planet earth to do it . 
  why not just go with that ? 
  number of `` jobs '' is irrelevant . 
  what matters is production . 
  figuring out the `` distribution '' is the easy part . 
  because numbers matter ... how can a nation of 5 million have any pull among countries with 100 million + people ?? 
  if you want to disappear from history and become irrelevant on a world stage , go ahead with your automation crap . 
  who is `` we '' ? 
  europeans ? 
  europe as a whole ( including north america ) are less than 10 % of the planet 's population . 
  it 's not us who are doing this . 
  it 's the other 90 % that needs to be reduced . 
   but how can we introduce more authoritarian measures regarding family planning without falling down a slippery slope similar to last century ? 
  numerically speaking , eu 's `` cultural '' and `` economic '' policies have killed more europeans ( indirectly ) than both world wars combined . 
   great post , but i would argue that what is said about scandinavia in the article , how they mix parenthood with work shows true in statistics regarding fertility rates yeah , those are n't swedes or norwegians who are having those babies ... you think france 's relatively high fertility rate has anything to do with their generous welfare system ? 
  here is norway 's tfr by birth origin :  norway ( 1.8 ) , somalia ** ( 4.4 ) ** , iraq ** ( 4.3 ) ** , morocco ** ( 3.6 ) ** , pakistan ** ( 3.2 ) ** , turkey ** ( 2.3 ) ** ... 
   if there was some simple solution , i 'm sure someone would already come up with it . 
  what nonsense . 
  i could solve this in a few years . 
  no , the eu would n't like because it would n't fit their notions of `` democracy '' , `` freedom '' , `` egalitarianism '' , `` equality '' , and all that crap ... probably be called a fascist nazi too for a while . 
  but it would work i guarantee you . 
  so here are our options as a people : extinction , or survival but being labeled as a `` sexist nazi '' for a few years until they get tired of it and just give up . 
  choose one . 
   many young people study until they 're about 24-25 . 
  then they spend a few years building their careers and saving money , they often do n't have their own place until they 're 30 . 
  it does n't have to be that way . 
  more specialized education early on combined with better urban planning so we 're not all cramped into one of the few `` urban work centers '' , would mean that people could have a career and their own place as early as 20 . 
   the state ca n't do anything about this , people are free to make their own decisions and nobody can pressure them into having families . 
  you are really underestimating the impact of culture on people 's decisions and lifestyles ... culture can be changed . 
   i 'm not avoiding anything . 
  you 're hijacking the whole identity of european to mean something civic , when i 'm trying to preserve its ancestral meaning . 
  think how stupid that sounds . 
  if your mother gave birth to you in china , you would then be asian ? 
  really ?? 
   are you an european citizen ? 
  then , yes , you are european , even if you feel `` special '' and `` not brainwashed '' ( aka , edgy kids from the internet ) . 
  but you just said that european means following a set of `` values '' and `` cultural norms '' . 
  i do n't subscribe to any of those . 
  what eu imagines a `` new european '' to be , i am definitely not .
