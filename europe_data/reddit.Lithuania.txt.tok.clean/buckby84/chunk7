  so am i still a european ? 
   are you an european citizen ? 
  then , yes , you are european , even if you feel `` special '' and `` not brainwashed '' ( aka , edgy kids from the internet ) . 
  european is n't even a nationality . 
  there 's french nationality , german nationality ... eu `` nationality '' is barely a nationality . 
  and eu is n't synonymous with europe . 
  belarus is n't part of the eu . 
  are its people still european ? 
   you can check here . 
  that map barely holds any meaning . 
  and like i keep telling you - all those groups are indigenous to europe !, 
  the only reason latvians and the irish appear to be different is because they have been separated from each other for thousands of years . 
  but both are still part of the same , broader `` racial entity '' than is european because that `` set of groups '' as a whole has been separated for something like 20,000 years from the rest of humanity . 
  latvians and irish are n't separate `` races '' . 
  they just have a slightly different `` genetic character '' . 
  how any of this implies that we now have to import vietnamese by the millions is beyond me ... 
  you know , you could have a state of some particular `` racial character '' without being it composed of just a single ethnicity ? 
  2-3 dominant ethnic groups is fine . 
  and that 's what canada and america were before 1960s . 
  there is a huge difference of japan-like homogeneity versus a `` rainbow of races '' that they 're trying to have now . 
  they do the same to us - xenophobia , islamophobia , homophobia ... like i have a phobia of such things . 
   ah , so there are levels in between . 
  that 's not a `` level '' , that 's an insignificant trace . 
  no one in the real world would buy your `` native americanness '' . 
   so someone can be 1/20th european . 
  do those people get to stay in europe in your version of european society ? 
  our goal should be to not even have such things as a `` 1/20th european '' . 
  and you do that by not importing non-europeans by the millions . 
  i would n't want people to have divided or mixed loyalties with `` confused '' origins . 
  i want them to have a clear sense of who they and where they 're from . 
  apparently you think the opposite ... 
   really ? 
  i found it beautiful because it 's not cheap propaganda . 
  that 's what every good propaganda looks like ... propaganda would n't good if people were aware that they are consuming propaganda . 
   there are people who feels 100 % european despite their ancestry , they can `` feel '' whatever they want to feel . 
  feelings do n't change the reality . 
   for once , i 've heard their point of view directly by them and not filtered by a political faction . 
  ... natgeo ** is ** a political faction . 
  that 's what i 'm trying to say to you - this cover was about advancing a particular political agenda . 
   it would n't fit under `` indigenous '' but it would fit under european . 
  and that 's exactly what i 'm trying to avoid here . 
  european should mean indigenous to europe . 
  of europe . 
  not simply in europe . 
   i care more about what people think and what their ideologies . 
  my ideology is likely to be radically different from yours and most other brainwashed europeans . 
  am i still european to you ? 
  also , using that standard for what is a `` european '' and what is n't , 95 % of europeans who have ever been alive would n't be european to you because they had radically different value systems and ideologies ... `` values '' come and go . 
  the only constant is ancestry . 
  it 's idiotic to base your whole identity under some `` personality of values '' crap . 
   which is meaningful because you did n't do much about that history . 
  what does that even mean ? 
   a black person born in france , with black parents who also born in france it will be black . 
  but it will also be french and european . 
  your argument is retarded . 
  you are acting as if european as a race or an ethnicity . 
  european is ancestry , yes . 
   most european have dna from different races and there is n't a single european ethnicity . 
  what races are those then ? 
   i have some `` native american '' blood in me , something like 1/256th . 
   am i a native american ? 
  you are . 
  the whole 1/256th of you . 
  you just answered your own question . 
   also , what exactly do you mean by `` indigenous '' ? 
   is it a bad thing that it went against everything the nation was founded upon , when the nation was founded on racism , slavery and genocide ? 
  and here i thought that canada was founded on the independence from the britain ...  italians , greeks , eastern europeans and jews have no connections to the originally anglo and french foundation of canada . 
  are they `` alien '' to the land , or not simply because they are white ? 
  canada was something like 90 % anglo even as early as 1960s . 
  you people severely overestimate the `` diversity '' of canada of that time . 
   the racial caste thing is a repugnant ideology . 
  why would it ever become a `` racial caste thing '' if a country is composed of only one race/ethnicity ? 
  that 's exactly what we 're trying to avoid here . 
   it changes under the law and the only thing that matter is the law , not your feelings . 
  language has meaning . 
  i want you to explain how a person born to two african parents in europe would fit under the definition of `` indigenous '' . 
   if they have european nationality , they have all rights , therefore they can call themselves european . 
  rights granted by the state . 
  yes , and that is my point - their relationship to any european country is through the state , not through some historical relationship like ancestry . 
  there is a difference . 
  a german shepherd born in australia is still a german shepherd and not an australian shepherd . 
  geography has nothing to do here . 
   europe is n't a race , most european have dna from very different races . 
  what are they ? 
   there were aboriginal people living on the ** land ** . 
  and that 's the keyword i was looking for . 
  those people did n't live in `` canada '' . 
  english did not `` immigrate '' into canada . 
  there was no canada to begin with . 
  they did n't immigrate into any country . 
  this is just one tribe acquiring more land for their tribe at the expensive of another tribe ... literally the story of humanity !, 
   i do n't see what the moral justification is for a country founded under such circumstances to remain `` white '' or european or what have you . 
  canada is far from the only place on this planet to be `` acquired '' in such way ...  the entire ideology of ` multiculturalism ' was created by the canadian government and is written in the constitution . 
  yeah , and it went against everything canada was founded upon . 
  trudeau is a quasi-communist who is giving up a whole continent away just to satisfy some `` moral abstraction '' ...  at this time america , australia , and new zealand also dropped racial restrictions to immigration . 
  i thought this was widely recognized as a moral step forward , but i guess not . 
  there does n't have to be anything `` moral '' about this . 
  nation-state is not a `` morality institution '' . 
  it 's an ethnic/racial institution . 
  giving up lands that you own just seems idiotic to me .
