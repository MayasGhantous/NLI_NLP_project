  yup . 
  they reduce their entire national life to pure economics , and later bitch about how `` england has no culture ! '', 
  `` all our culture comes from foreigners ! '', 
  `` look how boring our food/music is ! '', 
  `` english are so materialistic and selfish ! '', 
  `` we need more diversity ! '', 
  ... well what did you expect ?? 
  leftism is truly a mental disorder . 
   i guess it just `` sells '' there too and it 's definitely not their goal to push those issues . 
  yes !, 
  but the motives behind that are ** economic ** , not political . 
  they simply want to make money off of it and not satisfy some grand political agenda . 
  people are naturally tribal . 
  `` racism '' did n't have to be invented . 
  civic denotes your relationship to a particular state . 
  ethnic is about your ancestral relationship to a particular people . 
  now which do you think fits the most to a person born to two african parents in england ? 
  why are we playing stupid here ? 
  if your mother gave birth to you in china , that would n't make you chinese . 
  it 's nonsense . 
  this shows 1.70 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_lithuania#after_world_war_ii_2 either way , we could make up some of it by just making it extremely easy for anyone with a lithuanian ancestry to settle here . 
  it 's either that or we annex kaliningrad and parts of poland ... 
  `` racism '' is not restricted to the `` far-right '' . 
  i think `` race issues '' sells in america to large portions of its population . 
  fox news is # 1 news network in america so obviously they seem to understand american populace the best . 
  but if you actually watched their news , you would see that they could n't give shit about anything except deregulating the markets , lowering taxes , and imposing american hegemony on the rest of the world . 
  nothing about that is `` far right '' . 
  look up the definition of a neo-con . 
  i do n't know if you think you know what that means . 
   huh ? 
  what country are you refering too ? 
  because sure , last year there was a decreased amount of newborn compared to 2014 ( 37 babies , to be exact ) but that was the second highest amount of newborn since 1993 . yeah ... but most of those babies are n't from swedish parents . 
  i 'm talking about the number of babies of swedish ancestry . 
  no way that number is up from 1993 . 
  it has probably peaked in the 1970s and has been going down ever since . 
   and as for the demographic-economic paradox ... well , for some still unknown reason ethnical swedish women have a small demographic surplus fertility . 
  oh yeah ... `` unknown '' . 
  sweden 's culture is not to blame here , right ? 
  i did n't say it was an ethnicity . 
  it may be a race , but at the very least , it refers to any of the people indigenous to europe . 
  there was no `` canada '' before the europeans ... land mass is not a country . 
   no , i do n't . 
  yeah , you do . 
   simply being `` ethnic '' european means nothing . 
  yeah it does . 
  we have a historic right to these lands independent of contemporary politics . 
   if those people in the photo have european citizenship they have the same right as you to call themselves european . 
  they can call themselves whatever they want . 
  it does n't make them so . 
  i could think of myself as chinese , but that would n't matter . 
  their `` legal status '' within our polity does not change anything of essence . 
  they could have multiple citizenships in multiple countries , it would n't matter . 
  how is he far-right ? 
  is anything a bit to the right of jeremy corbyn far-right to you people ? 
  yes !, 
  and they 're american in a ** civic ** sense !, 
  ( hopefully ) . 
  but they 're not all `` american '' in an ** ethnic ** sense !!, 
  there is no `` ethnic american '' or `` american race '' . 
  maybe you can consider native americans to be that , but i do n't know . 
  this still makes my point . 
  birth rates here have been going up ( it 's 1.75 now ! ) . 
  immigration is slowing down . 
  a good portion of people are coming back . 
  then we have immigration from other parts of europe into lithuania ... it 's far from hopeless . 
  i have no doubt we 'll get through this we just have terrible politicians at the moment ... 
  do you grasp the difference between people 's ** civic ** identity and ** ethnic ** identity ??? 
  using your logic , an irish person born in america is equivalent in all aspects to a cherokee person of america because they happen to hold the same passport . 
  i could n't give two shits what happens to the central banks or government budgets if the native peoples go extinct . 
  the `` new europeans '' could go full communist sharia law whatever i do n't care . 
  it literally makes no difference to me at that point because i do n't live in an economy , i live in a nation . 
  and if your entire economic model revolves around constant `` growth '' , then you 're doing something wrong . 
  a spectre is haunting europe ... 
  rupert murdoch is n't `` far right '' . 
  there is a huge difference . 
  `` free markets '' and american dominance is all that matters to people like him . 
  they could n't care less what their cattle looks like or what language they speak . 
  the number of swedes between the ages of 0-4 shrinks every year . 
  how do you explain that ? 
  the number of children a woman has during her ** lifetime ** is definitely below 2 in sweden . 
  i agree that fertility rate does not tell the full story , but it is very telling in other ways . 
  in civic sense , maybe . 
  in an ethnic/indigenous sense , no way . 
  ethnicity is a subset of race . 
   ah , so black people who born in europe are n't european ? 
  they 're ** in ** europe , but they 're not ** of ** europe . 
  a person born to two british people in america does n't suddenly become a cherokee or sioux or navajo just because he was born in a region where those people are indigenous . 
   should we deny them some rights ? 
  no , but we should stop using dishonest language for political agenda . 
   what would be the definition for european ? 
  indigenous to the continent of europe . 
  what a stupid question . 
  that 's like asking who really is a `` native american '' . 
  you know exactly how this shit works on a more `` exotic people '' , but somehow you play stupid when it 's about us . 
  this is a deliberate policy . 
  and europe is n't some `` new frontier '' for all the world to settle into . 
  we 're sovereign people in our own sovereign nations . 
  we 're no longer nomads . 
   attracted people from all over the empire for centuries , centuries ?? 
  their commonwealth immigration policy only got instituted in the 1950s .
