  not beautiful . 
  they 're just trying to exploit us emotionally . 
  we 're naturally altruistic so that 's why it works . 
  preying on people 's weaknesses for some grand political agenda is evil . 
  yeah , it does . 
  they 're slowly trying to introduce this `` interchangeability '' of european , where `` european '' means nothing but believing some set of `` values '' like `` democracy '' , `` freedom '' , `` free markets '' , etc. . . and it 's just nonsense . 
  except that all those groups are indigenous to european continent . 
  that 's what makes it european culture . 
  it 's not simply in europe , it 's ** of ** europe . 
  also , i 'm not even sure what you people think `` culture '' means . 
  you can import `` cultural ideas '' , without importing people , you know ? 
  when i hear asian , i think people of asian ( mongoloid ) race . 
  indians are not of asian race . 
  they literally have no traces of it . 
  `` indian '' is a mixture of european and african peoples . 
  so that 's why it makes no sense to call them `` asian '' ... 
   the two are not the same and it 's important to separate them . 
  i doubt a lot of people would have anything against a sensible immigration policy like that of canada or australia , mostly matched with high-skilled migrants from culturally compatible nations . 
  i certainly would . 
  canada 's fertility rate is at around ~ 1.6 . 
  their government is literally replacing their founding people with people who have no connection to that historic project . 
  i certainly do n't want that . 
  i want no immigration until we get our birth rates back up . 
  otherwise you 're not solving anything , but instead just replacing your own people . 
  there is not a single instance in all of human history where economic incentives have been successful at raising the birth rates of a decadent society . 
  it does n't exist . 
  our politicians do n't even know our own history . 
  all they know is `` the holocaust '' and how we must repent for it by removing ourselves from this planet . 
  low birth rates stem from culture , not economics . 
  our idiotic politicians and `` experts '' do not seem to get this for some reason . 
  south america has no choice with that what with all those indigenous people , slaves , and catholicism preaching nothing but universalism . 
  also , many of them do think of themselves as one race . 
  look up `` la raza c\u00f3smica '' . 
  they do have a racial consciousness . 
  and mexico certainly does n't have open borders . 
  what does that tell ? 
  are you kidding me here ? 
  quoting abraham lincoln ??? 
  he certainly meant only certain european groups . 
  the guy was an actual white supremacist . 
   i will say then that i am not , nor ever have been , in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the black and white races -- that i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes , nor of qualifying them hold office , nor to intermarry with white people ; and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which i believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality . 
  \\ - abraham lincoln also , america was a brand new country . 
  we did n't need them to adopt our history - there was none . 
  we needed them to make history . 
  america was nothing but wilderness 400 years ago remember that . 
  yeah , thanks communism . 
  what possible jurisdiction does a british government have on companies located in vietnam and owned by vietnamese people ? 
  you ca n't tax them . 
  that 's my point . 
  you can only tax the british consumer through things like vat . 
   of course it is . 
  this is a claim you 're making , but there 's nothing in science or academia that points toward ethnicity being the end-all , be-all factor that ties people together into nations . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_nepotism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j._philippe_rushton#genetic_similarity_theory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/on_genetic_interests https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kin_selection https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross-race_effect https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/out-group_homogeneity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inclusive_fitness#hamilton.27s_rule https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/group_cohesiveness#similarity_of_group_members https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/altruism_%28biology%29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/group_selection  on the contrary , loads of different factors have been pointed out , with ethnicity being just one of them . 
  i do n't see any reason we need ethnicity being part of the equation at all . 
  i just explained it to you . 
  national identity implies continuity . 
  without continuity , an identity is n't really an identity , but a personality . 
  so basing your `` national identity '' on some temporary cultural norms and attitudes is idiotic because those change every 50 years or so . 
  it needs to be based on something constant like ethnicity . 
  after all , that 's what ethnicity is - a constant lineage of descent . 
  that was your `` identity '' is not contractual . 
  you are swedish because you are swedish . 
  have been for thousands of years . 
   why does it have to ? 
  because seeing yourself as being part of some great and historic is good at creating strong sense of identity and purpose . 
   nationalism was n't a thing 200 years ago , so that 's already ruined as it is when looking into the past . 
  they would n't have cared about you whatsoever because you 're basically a complete alien to them . 
  tribalism was ... tribes have always existed even if they did n't have clear borders . 
  and nations are n't defined by borders or maps . 
  i just explained this to you . 
  nationalism is just a more organized form of tribalism . 
  `` boundaries '' too between people have existed especially in forms of language . 
  people were actually a lot less `` interchangeable '' as they seem to be now . 
  it 's only recently that two germans from the opposite sides of german lands are able to think of themselves are being related to one another . 
   the perception that there is continuity in all of this actually springs out of the 19th century -- and this is one of the fundamental perceptions that laid the foundation for the national romantic ideal , but this argument is actually historical revisionism . 
  sure there is . 
  maybe not entirely down some anonymous tribes of people who supposedly roamed these lands tens of thousands of years ago because that sort of history would n't seem that `` personal '' to you anyways even if it was completely authentic , but certainly each people have ( and should have ) roots that stretch at least a thousand years . 
  genetic testing in many parts of europe actually do show continuity between peoples now and before . 
  in my country , `` ethnic contents '' of a people are essentially the same as they were 3000 years ago . 
  this is science . 
   that 's what national and ethnic nationalism was , too , when they were introduced . 
  nothing new there , then . 
  these two ( which you seem to defend ) were never rooted in reality . 
  what connection does a somalian person have to any of the people in french history books ? 
  there is a reason britain and america is now rewriting its history because it was `` too white '' . 
  things like that just show the failure of civic nationalism . 
  it 's literally just the reduction of everything meaningful to a lowest common denominator . 
  explain to me , what identity does a multi-cultural society have ? 
  exactly !, 
  so how would we tax companies that have relocated to china but yet still allowed to sell their products on the european market ? 
  that 's why it 's important for companies to stay here no matter how `` unproductive '' they seem to be in the short run . 
   no , `` the machines '' will fund the people that own them so they can get better and more reliable machines that require less human intervention . 
  yes , and through progressive taxation , it would also fund the state and the people . 
  yeah , and ? 
  they would n't be allowed to sell it on our markets . 
  it would n't matter how cheap it is . 
   i wonder how blue collar joes will feel when manufacturing finally returns to the west just to be outsourced to machines ? 
  it would n't matter to me . 
  the `` output '' of those machines would still be owned by a nation collectively . 
  the `` distribution '' is the easy part here .
