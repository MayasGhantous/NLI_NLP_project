  it 's hard , you know . 
  it 's so hard to not break out screaming about being stranded in the middle of nowhere at night by db and their so-called `` punctuality '' again ... no ... fuck ... thinking about deutsche bahn is not good for my health . 
  how can such evil exist in this world ? 
  i hate them so much . 
  my friends took me to italy and were like `` oh boy wait till you see how our trains run , you 'll wish you were never born !, 
  '' , and it was a perfectly pleasant , well-organized and clean experience better than a lot of my trips with db . 
  is it just my luck ? 
  also the people never come on time either but that 's just a relief . 
  it was all very flat and there were too many tulips :( ( i do n't feel very comfortable in flat places , it 's unnatural, 
  i may have seen a prostitute get raped . 
  my friends did n't let me do anything about it . 
  other shit as well . 
  only strasbourg , it seemed alright , straight enough roads and is german anyway :p, 
  haha , they actually had to carry me out of a coffeeshop , still thought it was a shithole . 
  lots of places in south and southwest and berlin . 
  i lived there and still think germans are awesome . 
  amsterdam just seemed like a soulless , mind-bogglingly blatant tourist trap . 
  germans are unbelievably , disturbingly friendly . 
  it 's awesome to make eye contact with every passing stranger and chat about my home country with old people in bus stops . 
  i acquired two schoolgirl bffs/stalkers and can no longer post on facebook about going to germany . 
  also , i love the food . 
  also , i love everything and no stereotype turned out true . 
  i expected amsterdam to be fun . 
  it really , really was n't . 
  switzerland is made up entirely of roundabouts in my experience . 
  '' * at the roundabout , take second exit to the right . 
  at the roundabout , take second exit to the right . 
  at the roundabout , take second exit to the right . 
  at the roundabout , take second exit to the right . 
  at the roundabout ... * '' oh god fuck you, 
  what the fuck ? 
  poland you fail at eastern europe . 
  they were going to build our new nuclear power plant . 
  poland . 
  never really hear anything good about it but mazury and pomerania are amazingly beautiful , like the most beautiful parts of lithuania but going on for hours and hours . 
  it even got a bit boring after a while . 
  and i got to see a concentration camp so that was alright i guess, 
  i have n't heard about non-jewish graveyards being uprooted this way in lithuania , but i could be wrong . 
  normal eastern european people are often very glad to see the emigrant types getting out of the country and prefer not to live next to them abroad :(, 
  i was really sick last week and now i ca n't walk for 15 minutes before getting really tired with a headache and nausea . 
  and the weather is so fucking beautiful i could just look at the clouds for hours . 
  someone please wrap me up in a blanket and carry me outside so i can get drunk there instead of my room . 
  ( will beer cure my affliction ?? 
  will the weather get worse just to stop me being depressed ?? 
  tune in tomorrow ), 
  i think it 's because everyone found out about my mom 's baked cauliflower recipe . 
  the point is there 's nothing stopping people from voting for a russian politician just because he 's russian . 
  was n't our president 's dad russian too ? 
  you forget how popular he was just a while ago ? 
  as a lithuanian i 'm literally unable to understand this perspective . 
  out people worship ethnic russian politicians . 
  [ heavy breathing ], 
  omg senpai noticed us, 
  reddit taking 4chan seriously . 
  come on guys . 
  never seen anything interesting , you ought to take the 16 sometime . 
  is this a response to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/4cxnjq/t%c3%bcrken_stehen_hinter_erdogan/ ) ? 
  well , at least our russians have citizenship . 
  that 's a really difficult question . 
  most people do n't care as much about roots and history as i do ... among those that do , traditional multiculturalism and our relations with neighbors might be a big thing ( always looking for someone or other to be our brother ) . 
  national pride is practically nonexistent . 
  we are pretty hardworking and practical , complaining about every thing under the sun and making awkward , pained attempts to appreciate what we have , hoping to improve by taking cues from more successful countries . 
  also , not being russia is a big thing . 
  i do n't like the buttons on the left and the new style of displaying links , i want to see as many articles as possible when scrolling . 
  the snoo in the comment box is confusing , needs to be transparent . 
  what the fuck ? 
  i ca n't believe this . 
  does it not account for the fact that men are underrepresented in some areas ( like teaching ) that need their participation ? 
  they took all of one minute to ban me for [ this comment ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/4cte0r/the_mods_of_rrussia_do_not_support_the_harmful/d1ll8b2 ) . 
  i have n't been this excited in weeks . 
  ** petry : ** you will certainly be able to tell me whether going to daycare at eight weeks hurt me or not . 
  ** spiegel : ** you became head of afd . 
  kek, 
  well-adjusted westerners is a bold claim to make about lithuania, 
  it 's probably impossible to be sad while wearing one of those folk costumes . 
  imagine 32 hours in an old-timey wooden train, 
  that made my butt hurt just looking at it . 
  red cabbage is amazing but you have to leave it on pretty much overnight . 
  best blue color i 've seen . 
  sorry , i ca n't stop laughing at this . 
  * i still have n't cleaned my room *, 
  am i reading this wrong or is this fucked up ? 
  old people in my country just drink to take their minds away from their shitty lives . 
  are those buttons for adjusting the butter temperature ? 
  what does the pen do ? 
  i grew up reading memoirs of the deported as a kid , for some reason . 
  the most memorable one for me was kids scraping out bread crusts out of the frozen shit of russian officials . 
  there was a bison burger place close to my home for a while . 
  not purim !, 
  :( on the other hand , the worship service seems more appropriate at this time rather than a holiday based on getting shitfaced . 
  she did get very lucky . 
  obligatory yay lithuania, 
  maybe he means the refugees from chechnya ? 
  he should be concerned for whole other reasons . 
  edit : and who could forget the ukrainians !, 
  we have 4000 tatars but you probably do n't care about us ; _ ;, 
  what , all two of our refugees ? 
  erfurt is the one i know about , my school used to do exchange programs with them and there 's a street named after it . 
  gdansk has a cultural exhibit in some of our ethnic fairs . 
  tbilisi is an easy one since lithuania tries to take care of georgia in general , they send over their artists and food .
