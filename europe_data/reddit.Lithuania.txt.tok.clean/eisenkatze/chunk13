  i wrote some stuff about an interesting vilnius-bialystok joint cultural program a while ago but realized it 's partnered with kaunas , i dunno why they did n't do it there . 
  we also have a million cheap flights to oslo lol, 
  magic !, 
  we 're not important enough to be in an article : /, 
  how did they make a black lamp ? 
  crickets . 
  the lithuanian population is finally happy because there is no government . 
  out of curiosity , how did you find reddit ? 
  can confirm , beer is great, 
  go to vilnius or auk\u0161taitija , it 's a lot more beautiful than kaunas to klaip\u0117da . 
  though there is a decent enough interwar-era road called \u017demai\u010di\u0173 plentas with small old towns around it . 
  still not worth it . 
  edit : i 'd say cycle around dz\u016bkija ( soviet sculpture park ) , vilnius region ( beautiful surroundings and the city is great ) , auk\u0161taitija ( great nature , a lot of new tourist infrastructure and things to see , wine country ) , then take a bus or train to the coast and ride the entire 99 kilometers from latvian border to russia . 
  \u017demaitija has not been good from what i 've seen from the train , but there are some cute obscure places i 've visited by car , so you might want to consult better sources . 
  there 's like only one good bar there . 
  you are so painfully behind the times , mister . 
  that 's more 60s in my opinion , very groovy . 
  i think all our streets are upstanding and catholic , but there 's one named `` my father 's street '' which makes me chuckle since `` your father '' is our version of `` yo momma '' . 
  there is an [ official list ] ( http://www.vlkk.lt/aktualiausios-temos/rasyba/gatviu-pavadinimu-sudarymas-ir-rasymas ) of what names are allowed and our residents actually complain if they 're given a street name that 's considered `` offensive '' in slang , so no dice . 
  in klaip\u0117da , street names also have to `` not incite racial hatred '' . 
  in tel aviv , there 's a beach officially called peepers ' beach because it 's next to the religious women 's bathing area . 
  my momma do n't let me read it, 
  i just ca n't deal with how beautiful that part of the world is . 
  deal . 
  i 'm mad at lidl for taking so long , but i 'll spend ages in there if they have prices similar to german ones . 
  ca n't come quickly enough, 
  what an interesting map . 
  i did n't know we have such a low tax rate compared to other countries . 
  business pls come, 
  volunteer workers ca n't be downvoted ? 
  cartoon network . 
  i fucking hate everything , had my summer clothes picked out and all, 
  also cats . 
  my most used word in german is `` derdiedas ? '', 
  what in the fuck do you do with 10 tenses ? 
  i think the guy looks very hungarian . 
  wish something on earth were able to break the dairy cartel . 
  there 's only so much sticking flags and patriotic slogans on milk cartons will do . 
  ramblys , which is just elephant with the first letter dropped off . 
  winnie is mik\u0117 p\u016bkuotukas , which is just `` fluffy mik\u0117 '' . 
  i suggest may , june or september for the nicest weather and most social events . 
  that actually sounds awesome, 
  lithuania is a really good country for beer !, 
  ^ ( please visit ), 
  that sounds like my boyfriend . 
  what the fuck did you do to your latvians then ? 
  lithuanians act just as bad as any russian . 
  is it two-way assimilation or what ? 
  holy crap , wish i 'd taken a different route home last night from my murphy 's marathon . 
  i feel that russian jews are more russian than russian russians . 
  is that real, 
  that 's too long . 
  how about fie-rom ? 
  actually , it 's ostensibly from tzarist officials giving the name to lithuanians they disliked , because `` goat '' is a grave insult . 
  if you mean kazlauskas , most common lithuanian names are slavic . 
  i guess we 're just not into surnames originally . 
  was it so hard to just put `` goat '' for lithuania ? 
  thank you , that was very interesting !, 
  i spent my study abroad in a very immigrant-heavy area , admittedly mostly in a safe student town , but i felt it was a very comfortable and interesting environment . 
  i 've read all the arguments , multiple times . 
  i still do n't get it : why does greece care ? 
  i 've read all the arguments , multiple times . 
  i still do n't get it : why does greece care ? 
  no , i just made a comment on reddit . 
  can you elaborate ? 
  why does greece care ? 
  fee-rom or few-rom ? 
  this is important i swear . 
  no sources , just seeing people i knew , people in the streets pushing baby buggies all of a sudden , my own relatives having children and stories in the media that are too old to dig up . 
  but then again , lithuanians are poor enough to fall for this , maybe sweden and such are n't . 
  anyway , money really helps with making babies . 
  seriously , middle-class people intentionally got pregnant to take advantage of the welfare offered by the state before it got cut , because they figured they would n't have the money afterwards . 
  welfare raised the birthrates here , whatever you 're trying to say . 
  fucken everyone was pregnant before the deadline to reduce maternity leave .

  that is just so adorable, 
  i think sms is very important when coordinating things outside the home , or is it just my friends and their crappy phones ? 
  so basically , the west is getting as crazy as eastern europe always was ? 
  i 'm making the popcorn as we speak . 
  holy fuck, 
  okay , that is the most romantic thing i 've ever heard . 
  op asks for real life examples though . 
  no votes for russian ? 
  eastern europe still has quite a few connections with them ( decreasing as they are ) and they 're less likely to communicate in other languages . 
  i 'm not sure how the whole business thing is going with the sanctions these days , but we also still get a number of tourists . 
  thanks !, 
  i have it , but i hope some of the sub users will listen to it , it 's beautiful . 
  i do n't think any of that album is available online . 
  we have [ \u017dygimantas and barbora ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/barbara_radziwi%c5%82%c5%82 ) . 
  the legend says that she was poisoned by the king 's mother , but it was likely cancer . 
  it 's really hyped and here 's [ videos from a popular musical about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/radvilaiteslegenda ) . 
  unfortunately i ca n't find my very favorite songs about it on youtube :( ( ( so here 's a [ bonus song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc-nhmldjv8 ) from another , fictional romeo & juliet story about a sea goddess and a fisherman . 
  you do n't think it sounds very cute and adorable ? 
  what holidays are there besides christmas ? 
  does patriotism mean putting poland on the logo of every agency in the country ? 
  have you even seen the nasa logo ? 
  there 's no reason to draw all of poland inside a space logo . 
  any of them ? 
  semicircles = planets , satellites , moon phases,
