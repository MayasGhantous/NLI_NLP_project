  i identify as european more than anything else , especially when dealing with an overwhelming amount of usa residents . 
  how can people live like that ? 
  never gone for coffee with someone ? 
  i am from a warmer climate and the thought is horrifying to me . 
  what if the stove goes out while you 're in deep sleep and you freeze to death without ever waking up ? 
  it would be nice to go to sambia and visit historical places without a visa , but i suspect that 's the only benefit, 
  that comparison should be used more often . 
  from 19th century local literature , it does seem to be a similar situation . 
  a tent in winter in finland ? 
  how does this technology work ? 
  i lived on this in the dorms . 
  add a tomato and you have yourself a seriously classy meal . 
  i 'm gon na need an eli5 of the whole thing because i 'm completely fucking baffled . 
  who 's sending what where ? 
  augh , i hate the taste of fervex , get well soon, 
  o lord, 
  i fucking love those boxes of vegetables with cream and pray to god that lidl brings them over when they finally open here, 
  i ca n't think of any . 
  why would anyone foreign want to come here :( oh , i think there may be some people named swede , but perhaps i dreamt it . 
  hmm . 
  did peasants 100 years ago eat rice ? 
  i guess if we can have a hundred or so villages called switzerland , anything is possible ... 
  how does estonia know what rice is ? 
  nice try heinrich . 
   * plastic windows * . 
  this is a comedy article , right ? 
  i do , actually, 
  always . 
  do you have a lot of floods ? 
  you need jesus son, 
  fuck you i 'll drink however much i want, 
  it 's really easy to bitch about eastern europe until you actually go abroad . 
  after that it 's only moderately easy, 
  subpar medical services ? 
  really ? 
  nice , you got the name of leopard shirt guy ? 
  is n't poland acting similar though, 
  shit , you do n't have to emulate russia in * everything *, 
  but why do people even care ? 
  why not at least dig a hole in the ground for the house ? 
  harder to reach ... ... . . maybe you can find a place further than 500 meters from an eu-funded campsite with five maps of the nearest natural wonders . 
  that would be pretty extreme . 
  do you have any for makeup and fashion enthusiasts with asperger 's syndrome ? 
  i learned of it in israel and thought it was a local arab thing , the kebab places in berlin did n't contradict the theory . 
  my ex upon visiting : `` wow , you are fat compared to people in this country '' . 
  he meant it in a good way , but still : c, 
  you 're guilty too , right ? 
  :d it 's like state-sponsored propaganda, 
  the women . 
  i just do n't know where to start . 
  what do you think anesthetic means ? 
  it 's the same thing as putting down an animal . 
  they do n't just inject rat poison and watch your limbs rot off . 
  it 's fine . 
  there 's few places in vilnius downtown where you could get into any kind of trouble for any reason ( the aggressive kind of people stay in the far periphery ) , and there 's also a [ list of specifically gay-friendly establishments ] ( http://www.vilnius-tourism.lt/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lgbt-friendly-vilnius-2.pdf ) that mark this with a sticker on their door . 
  non-exhaustive list , there 's gay bars not on that list , for example . 
  ( do n't go to islandijos street though , it is a horrible horrible place ), 
  that sounds ... so much worse ... 
  damn , i love the idea of naked sauna and skinny dipping , but i 'm not sure if i 'd want to meet a hundred co-students by seeing their junk . 
  student mixers to meet new people ( and mix lonely students of different genders ) are often sauna parties here . 
  i wonder what a special reason might be . 
  how about religious exemption for sensitive innocent people from catholic countries ? 
  or is swimsuit in sauna worse than niqab in the voting booth ? 
  rules in my pool were shower before entering sauna and that 's it . 
  yes i do . 
  holy shit people got butthurt up there, 
  dunno , feels like a sauna . 
  you shower and swim or go to a hot bath afterwards anyway . 
  i wonder how finns do mixed sauna parties . 
  with a bathing suit ? 
  i 've never been to a sauna naked ... 
  it 's like those [ fucked up animals ] ( https://www.google.com/search?biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=bad+taxidermy+foxes&amp;oq=bad+taxidermy+foxes&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i19.80455.80920.0.81134.4.4.0.0.0.0.107.374.2j2.4.0....0...1c.1.64.img..3.1.107.6rfsri2uscw ) you see on the nets sometimes, 
  i do n't know why i laughed so hard at those borders, 
  i welcome you to circle any in those photos . 
  so that 's where all our men are ... 
  everything is funny in latvian :d krustojas sounds like a naughty word and the rest of the sentence is just , awwwww , latvian ... 
  i forget how it was when i visited israel , but he said that they have bars on windows on the third story as well , because `` well ... why would n't you ? '' ... 
  that must be the slightly rougher neighborhoods though ... 
  i was n't sure about the idea of even basement windows having bars, 
  it 's ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... silly in lithuanian . 
  well are n't we bourgeois here, 
  this is something i 've never thought about before . 
  i just assumed it varies in every house . 
  commieblock stairwells open outwards but apartment doors vary by model . 
  i live in a building with a big stairwell now and it opens outwards , in a normal brezhnevka it was inwards . 
  i think my friends ' place in a communal-type building also opens outwards . 
  do n't worry so much . 
  my friend from israel was shocked that in europe , not all windows have bars on them . 
  ahaha , thank you for reminding me about minsk refrigerators, 
  seriously ? 
  i do n't know whether to feel good or bad we 've beat riga in something for once . 
  seriously ? 
  riga is cheaper than vilnius ? 
  that ca n't be right . 
  we have [ koops ] ( http://img.lrytas.lt/show_foto/?f=4&amp;id=1028588&amp;s=19 ) , which does n't fit in with the cool kids :( [ clean logo ] ( http://www.kauno-koopdi.com/images/design/logo_koops.jpg ), 
  [ soundtrack to this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yacq1bvilrs ), 
  a friend of mine recently moved to austria from germany and says it 's insufferably intolerant and right-wing . 
  sounds sad . 
  though the afro coffee thing seems bullshit , i agree . 
  a journalist friend who worked in sweden and eu organizations told me .
