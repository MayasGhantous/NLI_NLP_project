  i think it 's mostly done through friends or work here , or maybe various places on the internet . 
  you do n't really talk to strangers much or make eye contact . 
  ( or maybe i 'm just really ugly ? ), 
  i do n't really know anyone who 's met their partner just by being outside in some place , and even in pubs , clubs and festivals i think people prefer to have their new friends vetted/checked by a mutual acquaintance . 
  there 's a kind of mistrust and hostility that 's countered only by being really really drunk or a foreigner - a foreigner is like public property and everyone 's instant friend . 
  you 're not scared of them because they probably do n't know your cousin and your mom 's coworker , so things are more casual with them . 
  the internet is also kind of like meeting friends of friends since people can be checked on and googled . 
  there has n't really been a stigma like i 've seen americans talking about `` omg i ca n't tell anyone we met on okcupid !!!!!!, 
  ! 1 '' , it suits our antisocial lifestyle . 
  weddings are very passe and are usually small affairs only for family . 
  i collected a huge harvest of valuable schisandra berries , let them grow mold and want to die of guilt now , even though i have n't even eaten half of 2011 's harvest, 
  our blackcurrant shrubs have been dead for years but the jam lives on . 
  no one ever tried to give those away !, 
  trying to give people apples gets really old tho, 
  strudels take a lot of work and ingredients . 
  juice takes equipment we do n't have . 
  but the jam will go onto sandwiches and pies with less effort . 
  also i think the coworkers have had quite enough of apples of their own, 
  sometimes with local cheap alcohol , they wo n't export to other countries . 
  like in germany they have 1 euro wine ( it 's passable to mix with lemonade ) , here things deserving even remotely the name of wine are 3 to 4 , with anything lower being poisonous and for hobos . 
  gl\u00fchwein , the cheapest mash of whatever , gets double the price here . 
  so i 'd assume vinho verde would n't be cheap here either , not as cheap as getting shitty champagne and disemboweling its very soul . 
  unexceptional woman , sexism , blatant mindless pandering of the american style - hate for the french has just risen up one notch . 
  maybe if you made a video with the one frenchman who 's of my type - i 've certainly never met one . 
  das ist how it sounds to me when french people speak . 
  um , the bottom shelf of wherever i buy does n't seem to carry this trearure . 
  it looks like it would cost more than 1.50 too . 
  i babysit my nephews from birth and help my sister be a housewife , so i know quite a bit of it . 
  once they stop sleeping all day , it 's hard to even just play with them for the whole day , much less trying to wrangle them into baths , clothes , eating and whatnot . 
  even with me having the kid all day , she got tired . 
  it 's a rough business . 
  i 'd love to do it full-time but i do n't think i have the mental capabilities to keep up with it . 
  do you mean the difference between moms and caregiving for the elderly ? 
  have done a bit of this lately as well . 
  it 's a big baby you have to wash the shit off but instead of hoping for them to grow up soon you hope for them to die soon . 
  still fulfilling for some people , i know several friends who work at it and love their patients but sadness always comes in the end . 
  such is tradition . 
  the family legacy . 
  the son refuses to take and process this rustic reminder of their rural past , for we are in a different age now and buy apples in a store ; the mother gets crushed by a tractor , symbolizing the inescapable march of industrialization . 
  not all mothers like babies either and there 's certainly not a huge interest in hourly shit-wiping and endlessly talking to a piece of meat so that it does n't rage and fuck shit up enthusiasts outside of the mother and caregiver circles, 
  [ oh hohohohoho ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg62zay3kck ) !, 
  i like to mix champagne , excuse me , sekt , with water from the tap :3 veni ad me frater, 
  shake the remains of your fucking apples from the trees , enough already . 
  bring buckets and crates home . 
  peel and grate the fuckers or smash them into mush somehow , i do n't know . 
  put that shit in a pot . 
  put sugar in a pot . 
  boil . 
  now you have a shitton of apple jam that nobody will eat because your sandwich toaster broke , but at least the fucking apples are gone . 
  that 's the extent of my knowledge . 
  i really wish european and especially eastern european feminism came up with their own theory and concerns rather than parroting bullshit american slogans like the wage gap and discrediting the entire movement . 
  le sigh, 
  men in nursing is a big thing , especially as the job does require physical strength , so it 's encouraged . 
  there 's programs and scholarships for men in teaching and kindergarten , since kids need male rolemodels . 
  some women also seem to want the right to go into the frontlines for some reason , no idea why . 
  you 're very welcome to become a nanny , or similarly a caregiver for the elderly . 
  it 's just wiping , washing and yelling at a slightly bigger baby to not kill itself . 
  the epitome of 2000 . 
  amazing, 
  in vilnius , it seems that the only cars trying to squeeze into the tiny old town streets are giant suvs that leave no space even on the sidewalk :( fuck that , at least put a size limit on them, 
  it 's not praying harder that they need to do, 
  oh my god . 
  the next trend in productivity has to be squatting desks . 
  imagine yuppie offices , everyone squatting at their computers and drinking carbonated health shakes from 2l beer bottle-shaped containers . 
  they see the shiny new hospitals , schools and healthcare projects which used to be unimaginable , i guess, 
  d : uhhh the fashion sounds awesome but the posh young women not so much ... well ... you live your life man ... 
  how did you become interested in models ? 
  what draws you to them and how do you use the information ? 
  i see people on / fa / talking about models sometimes and it 's interesting to me . 
  i 'm kinda glad that at least lithuania is n't winning in supermodels , it can be kinda cold and lonely when you 're a short and round girl . _ . 
  ^ ( may they all burn in the lord 's righteous anger ), 
  i get triggered by people caring about something as insignificant as signs to become pawns in their superiors ' local dick wiggling competition . 
  sounds kinda creepy . 
  we should be equal citizens , with extra government spending on dwindling cultural practices , but ultimately treated the same . 
  and with the mix of cultures during the interwar period , slightly changing the spelling of your name was never a significant problem - everyone did it and names were understood to be fluid and spelled in different ways whicever language you are using . 
  perhaps the mainland polish mentality sees the name as more of a monolith and family sigil , but here it 's just that - a name - something that you are called as . 
  russians will call you one thing , poles will call you another thing , but now a lithuanian is filling your documents so he 'll call you in the lithuanian way . 
  i see no problem with this . 
  i see no problem with just using whatever letters and emojis in passports too , so wtf, 
  if you are male , may i ask if this is a common and accepted interest among men , learning about models ? 
  are they usually photography models , fashion models , runway ones , erotic photography ? 
  also : claudia schiffer , you dolt . 
  and go on with lithuania . 
  can it be my friends ? 
  i could tell funny stories about three people from each place ... but i 'm convinced macedonia does n't exist . 
  omfg a ** sign ** , help help i 'm being repressed i think everyone should have all the signs they want but this is literally just like dogs marking their territory with piss , and people are taking it seriously for some reason . 
  what in the living fuck do ** you ** care about a ** street sign ** ? 
  the government is fucking with these guys are fucking with the government fucking with these guys and it 's a huge circlejerk over some . 
  signs . 
  which no one needs to read anyway !, 
  they 're names of some dead people in tiny villages where you navigate by the instructions `` left '' or `` right '' . 
  lastly , the bus that goes to my garden has the double signs on it where they invented a * new name for my village * in polish , whereas the village has no poles living it or near it . 
  because the bilingual placard would have lacked a je ne sais quoi , simply transliterating the village into polish phonetics . 
  it 's apparently a new village . 
  it 's like they just keep competing over who can piss each other off with the stupidest crap . 
  in arabic and hebrew writing too ? 
  so strange . 
  how do your systems handle that ? 
  i 've no dog in this fight but i 'd find it reasonable for his name to be transcribed into k\u0119stutis czerniauskas . 
  it 's still recognizable as lithuanian , and allows poles to pronounce it .
