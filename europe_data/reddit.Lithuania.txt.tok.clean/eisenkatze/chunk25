  maybe they count the ones that fly to scandinavia for work every two weeks . 
  thank you for the information . 
  it 's the same girl . 
  omg ... do you even realize how much makeup and editing is in these pictures, 
  what the hell is that last hairdo ? 
  do people actually wear that now ? 
  there is no giant object you can put in the square for the high holidays though . 
  i recently learned that fish do n't have the same type of pain receptors that higher animals do , they feel the hook the same way you feel your tooth being pulled with anesthesia . 
  it depends on your circles , many of my israeli and european jewish friends are married to or dating non-jews . 
  a large number of jews do n't care about that at all . 
  omg finally someone who agrees about the food , i was so hyped about exotic middle eastern food and pretty much the only good thing there is malabi and iced americanos . 
  why , what do you call it ? 
  why would anyone even think that ? 
  i think it 's a big factor that black people in eastern europe are assumed to be from a very faraway land and culture which most people know nothing about . 
  there 's always the thing about your children moving away ( even if it 's to london ) and having grandkids with a different native language . 
  also we 're super racist, 
  i did n't know little czechia was so filled with hatred, 
  [ maria antonia was innocent ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/bd/d4/d9/bdd4d9bbfe0624ed2318ef1b40f16c83--la-rose-marie-antoinette.jpg ) [ dicks out for marie ] ( https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/rose-of-versailles/images/1/12/ladyoscarcap07parallax1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130113193913 ), 
  they were not ussr, 
  there are excellent lithuanian cheeses if you know where to look , confirmed by many people from other countries . 
  we have a fucking chain of single-parmesan ice cream boutiques ffs, 
  when making simple sandwiches i strongly prefer it to mushy and bland gouda , unpleasantly chewy and hard-edged emmental or the similar but somewhat too tangy tilsiter . 
  i like buttery tastes and complex texture , so it 's really pretty decent as an inbetwren snack . 
  i kinda like the `` russian cheese '' in lithuania ? 
  it 's kind of pleasantly average , not too mild , not too chewy , with pleasant holes ... is this one different ? 
  in lithuania you have gradation from `` cheese '' to `` cheese product '' to `` protein-containing cheese product '' to `` plant-based product '' . 
  i 'm not even kidding . 
  all have cute names and shaped to look like cheese . 
  i thought that 's a shitty hippo head ? 
  people were mad about them running away in lithuania too , but tbh , why do they even care if it 's germany 's problem now ? 
  the refugees are just gon na run away to germany anyway , what 's the problem here ? 
  sounds like the ambien manicure i posted on reddit once, 
  excuse me but stalinist architecture is the pinnacle of artistic achievement . 
  china says it 's communist and does n't even have universal healthcare afaik . 
  when did it exist ? 
  i was too poor in the 90s to buy soft drinks . 
  oh , i thought i could like bang on someone 's door and harrass them with my trash while whining about how they 're destroying the environment . 
  this is n't nearly interesting enough . 
  i used one as check-in luggage at an airport , super convenient although they had to use a special lift because of the straps . 
  holy shit , where do i go to do this at a supermarket ? 
  i 've swum in the rhine , it was awesome and very clean !, 
  i think they even have a model aquarium in mainz of the kind of fish that live in the river now . 
  fucccc , the first time i tried uht milk in germany i literally drank the whole box and wrote home about it . 
  uht is life, 
  i actually feel like trudeau is `` more handsome '' like objectively , but i would n't date him or feel really attracted to him , while macron is someone i 'd feel comfortable around , make jokes with , hug and melt at seeing his happy facial expressions . 
  he just looks like a very friendly guy and that 's more appealing to me . 
  but people feel like they do . 
  also , i actually think he 's hot and trudeau is n't , some people are into different things . 
  ah yes , blog posts , that eternal arbiter of who is european . 
  explanation : there is also an abundance of articles and blog posts about why usagi is destined to be married to seiya and not mamoru . 
  people write all sorts of stupid shit on the internet . 
  yes ? 
  methinks someone is projecting their personal beliefs onto hundreds of millions of other people . 
  wtf do you think afrikaner means ? 
  he has a pleasant , expressive face with a lot of character . 
  we also tend to see people whose personalities we like more attractive , and for some reason everyone likes his personality . 
   neurotypical did you forget where you are ? 
  what the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  who upvotes comments like this ? 
  fixed winds ? 
  sorry , we do not have this concept in my country ? 
  bad reactionary idiot pretending to be an even worse tumblr idiot . 
  old pasta, 
  i love daft punk to bits but i hate that song , it was unavoidable everytime you enter a supermarket or any indoors business, 
  holy fuck , we are truly living in the future, 
  i never thought i would feel so hungry for icelandic food . 
  i 'd only heard about the rotten shark before . 
  oh right , fuck , i forgot . 
  very important to mash them with the salt to get the juices out . 
  i think you can rent that model for a party . 
  rrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeee what in tarnation are those white cubes ? 
  literally inedible . 
  use marinated beets , kefir and perhaps sour cream , mash the dill with rough salt , add the beets , kefir , cucumbers , water and boiled eggs . 
  pan-fried or baked potato wedges are best as garnish . 
  \\  carrots \\  onions me eyes, 
  next week will be consistently ~ 20 degrees , be grateful for our blessings, 
  i think you should try on / r/askeurope . 
  harem pants are okay too . 
  \\  tfw you want so badly to be german you spend all your money on toilets, 
  how do you get to live in the canary islands ? 
  is there a way to immigrate ? 
  no one told me about this !, 
  and sharing the sponge on a stick . 
  oh yeah , it 's very difficult to sound proper when you 're providing a `` devil 's advocate '' view , i 'm sorry : /, 
  nope , i can just talk to a guy in a bar to ask for the time or whatever and they would act like i 'm sexually harrassing them or whatever , and even call me and my friends `` whores '' for telling a joke . 
  my boyfriend thinks lithuanians are very unfriendly and aggressive people , which is a bit much but i can understand that . 
  when i was a teenager i did use to think guys are supposed to approach girls , from watching too many american movies , but i grew up and now i just want to talk to random people in a bar sometimes without them turning away and making a disgusted face . 
  maybe i 'm too autistic to even show up outside ? 
  living in germany is pretty crazy , you got your shy people and everything but everyone 's so nice and do n't say mean things , wtf . 
  yeah , i do n't think it 's the primary argument to be directed towards the antivaxxers themselves , but it 's how people justify laws for mandatory vaccination , because we are a community . 
  lol , i 'm good enough for pretty awesome foreign guys but not enough for locals to talk to . 
  [ btw here 's what incels are like ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sadcringe/comments/6mltqd/incel_idealizes_his_future_wife/ ) i do n't think it would be very effective . 
  too bad i 'm too ugly for lithuanian men . 
  we need imports, 
  maybe the [ list of populations that were decimated by measles ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/timeline_of_measles ) should be more publicized . 
   in 1529 , a measles outbreak in cuba killed two-thirds of those natives who had previously survived smallpox . 
  two years later , measles was responsible for the deaths of half the population of honduras to me `` measles '' sounds like a silly childish name , and the only thing i knew about it as a child was [ that one tom & jerry episode ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/polka-dot_puss ) , oh they got infected with red polka dots , big deal . 
  we do n't hear nearly enough about how many people it has killed . 
  you believe avoiding the astronomically small chance of vaccine side effects and exposing your child to common , severe diseases is `` protecting them '' ? 
  95 theses were a mistake,
