  i showed my 6 year old nephew a movie about building polders today and he was traumatized !, 
  thank you netherland, 
  i ca n't find english sources so quickly but before the second storm in the evening , there had been 55,4 mm of rain , or 55 liters per square meter . 
  he is the ultimate prize < 3,

  wtf , do n't diss google translate like that, 
  i was referring to `` stichinis meteorologinis rei\u0161kinys '' which was n't yet announced in the morning but i 'm not sure how to translate that ... 
  is now upgraded to emergency situation i think, 
  there 's no menu or channel choice for cb in my phone , it has some weird chinese functions instead . 
  maybe i can get smog alerts for beijing, 
  thank you !, 
  unfortunately my s5 seems to not be on the list and the indicated emergency alerts option does n't even exist on my phone , probably because it 's from china . 
  can only check/uncheck cell broadcast , maybe it will work, 
  i think the current design aesthetic is generally more flat , disjointed , cut up and slightly off-kilter - like beyonce 's pregnancy announcement photo which people thought was `` trashy '' but was a carefully composed trendy ironic vintage piece of the sort that are very often seen in today 's photography ; or normcore and vaporwave . 
  it does n't seem fresh at the moment to have a completely balanced , centered image with lots of depth . 
  more like a messy collage of photos, 
  a wizard , harry !, 
  please do n't delete this, 
  is there a way to subscribe to emergency alerts ? 
  my mom gets them and i never have, 
  o shit that 's me and i just flushed the toilet . 
  guess that 's no showers today, 
  [ drainage system engines flooded ] ( https://www.15min.lt/m/id/aktualu/lietuva/del-vilniu-uzklupusios-liuties-sutriko-upes-gatveje-esancios-nuoteku-siurblines-darbas-56-819530 ) , stopped working , residents of central neighborhoods asked not to use plumbing and detergents . 
  what a time to live in !, 
  why , did your feet get wet ? 
  [ my pants ] ( https://i.redd.it/z7gwrr2m5j6z.png ) . 
  now you know why vilnius was flooded today, 
  be nice . 
  your comment implied the coat of arms is a closeup of the flag on the map . 
  [ flag , not coat of arms ] ( https://www.google.lt/search?q=vilniaus+v\u0117liava&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;prmd=imnv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj0j8togt_uahvijpokhacecoqq_auicsgb&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=559&amp;dpr=3 ), 
  i 've never seen this in my life, 
  well , you sure sound like a discerning intellectual consumer . 
  there was that frontpage post on / r/science yesterday about finding how sex in advertising does fuck all . 
  humor is the effective way to advertise, 
  is there a makeup chemistry degree ? 
  i 'd hit that like a ton of bricks, 
  it sounds like a real name , i thought that was bad, 
  who the fuck is alice ? 
  does it mean anything ? 
  is the dude part maori ? 
   catch, 
  that 's not very unlikely tho, 
  wtf , that 's the first i 've heard of it . 
  why, 
  if it makes you feel better , i failed dating a tall guy once because i could n't fucking hear what he was saying . 
  is that specimen hand-drawn ? 
  she looks awfully pale, 
  lithuanian passports have french too, 
  prinzessin , oh my god . 
  can i ask them to call me pretty princess too ? 
  she has a hat for literally every possible situation, 
  interesting fact , i recently learned that cut errything that can be sold is called the scandinavian school of forestry . 
  such progressive, 
  i 'm curious about heat in india , i 've heard about the loo and it all seems so alien ... how does it feel ? 
  it 's always fucking phoenix, 
  it 's just not a very threatening video, 
  the open space is what i like most about berlin ... the long distances suck but it 's actually enjoyable to walk while seeing the sky . 
  and yeah , the eastern central neighborhoods are way nicer looking though they have no parking . 
  i do n't know if this refutes the argument ... ... ... 
  why he got ta be so fat tho, 
  it seems fun , they posted a lot of photos of their easter bonfire . 
  i guess that 's one function of a fire department, 
  well , that was the same reason male circumcision started in the us ( eliminate masturbation ) , so attitudes can change indeed . 
  people wo n't relinquish their cultural traditions so easily , but there could be a campaign that `` circumcision does n't have to be mutilation '' and reduce harm . 
  did you see the one where a woman 's butt implants flipped inside out , btw ? 
  damn people just buy a butt bra or a fake ass , they 're like five dollars from china . 
  i imagine it would be much easier to manage if they did the very minor procedure in hospitals and severely cracked down on diy . 
  i remember reading some stories from women in muslim countries that took their daughters to doctors and they recommended no circumcision for one and a small hood trimming for the other , for example . 
  it still sounds gruesome but much better than taking them to africa to get mutilated by grandmas . 
  i guess it 's somewhat similar to people who believe abortion is murder but still agree with the harm reduction that legality brings . 
  i spray my curtains in the winter to increase humidity and they dry out in like an hour . 
  bedsheet and duct tape . 
  tbh it 's one version is to remove a small bit of the clitoral hood , analogous to the foreskin . 
  allegedly it may increase sensitivity . 
  some others do a symbolic pinprick . 
  if there is no `` removing female pleasure '' aspect there are harmless ways . 
  my god people get upset about this . 
  it 's ethically wrong to cut a baby but it 's nowhere near the disaster uncircumcised people make it out to be . 
  * most * people think it 's a fundamental aspect of jewish identity , it 's done by non-religious people too . 
  i know many jewish people who disagree but it 's a matter of slowly changing culture . 
  how about wet curtains ? 
  edit : to clarify , some people use wet curtains to block the pollen , which dissolves in water , and it might help cool the room by evaporation . 
  i follow some random feuerwehr in brandenburg and all they seem to do is post on facebook and shout out to the other departments . 
  skirts are usually a better idea, 
  there are some very very interesting people in the world ... ditched her after she said my boyfriend would dump me and marry a jewish girl because that 's what jews do . 
  i do n't think being a goy is exactly why her exes did n't marry her ... 
  it 's 21 here and i 'm seriously regretting wearing shoes and pants outside . 
  all that sweat in so few seconds ... 
  really not the case in it from all i 've heard ... 
  tbh no one goes here to work , but is fucking women such a bad thing ? 
  what else are you going to do on erasmus ? 
  i 've only known portuguese who came here after marrying lithuanians though , they were really cool, 
  she thinks they only come to our country to fuck our women , are dirty people and i think she 's been hurt a lot in life . 
  we 're not actually friends anymore . 
  also she 's a leftist activist, 
  i have a friend who hates the portuguese, 
  what 's wrong with them ? 
  38 degrees in tel aviv . 
  `` enjoy the sunshine eisenkatze ! '',
