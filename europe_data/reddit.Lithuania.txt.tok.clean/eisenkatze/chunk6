  israelis are actually not very welcome in a lot of countries . 
  what about israelis ? 
  i know jews were fine historically , but how about visiting travellers now ? 
  seems i 've often heard that kind of talk before ... 
  seems poland is confirmed for southern california ... 
  not even unusual . 
  ever lived next to a construction site ? 
   that is a very british thing no . 
  deutsch . 
  beautiful , just beautiful . 
  but only in western germany where it 's sanft and schmeichelhaft , the one in berlin is pretty rough . 
  edit : shit i think i forgot how to deutsch , oh well , you get the idea . 
  russian , when it 's not on tv ( why the fuck do they all scream in that nasally voice ?? ), 
  or spoken by annoying gopniks . 
  that 's not very often ... but when someone i like speaks it , it 's beautiful . 
  serbian and all its relatives/variations is just hot . 
  my kidneys are damaged . 
  what other currencies do you accept ? 
  i fucking love summer storms . 
  but here is drought . 
  bad summer . 
  you 're out of your mind . 
  thanks !, 
  is the atlantic cold to swim in ? 
  thanks !, 
  this is really helpful . 
  is it as cold as the uk in the oceanic part ? 
  i thought the same , that the heatwave will be exciting and it will be fun to swim and drink cold beer , but really it 's just a week of depression , nausea and fighting with mediterranean friends about the fact that yes it is that hot fuck you and your sun . 
  it does n't even feel that hot . 
  just tired , sticky and sad . 
  i have n't been lucky in berlin and i do n't know anyone who 's eaten a tasty one there either . 
  maybe i should try the ones back in rhein-main area , it always had decent food , tho i always passed best worscht by , it seemed too spicy . 
  but why ? 
  what 's the weather like in different parts of spain ? 
  i believe it rains in valencia , but what 's it like compared to northern europe , and are the climate differences very big across the country ? 
  is there a place to go on vacation that does n't rise above 30 degrees ? 
  are most places dry or humid ? 
  i want to travel around but found out last week that anything above 30 is a no go for me :( ( (, 
  can europe take this much ** [ freedom ] ( http://orig13.deviantart.net/1568/f/2012/256/e/c/__murica__by_dragshadow97-d5elq55.jpg ) ** ? 
  not at all , but then and again you get americans on the internet being like `` hahaha gurlz i 'm sooo hairy that 's my eastern european genes  ) ) waxing is such a chore i wish my slavic grandma had n't given me this mustache '' which is like what ?? 
  who the fuck came up with eastern europeans being hairy ? 
  i see this a lot actually , and they 're often complaining about having an `` eastern european unibrow '' . 
  it 's impossible to understand . 
  mysterious american soul . 
  is there a currywurst that is actually good ? 
  any recommendations in berlin ? 
  the heatwave just ended , at least here . 
  buckwheat kasha , food of the gods, 
  what kind of basmati rice is not legit ? 
  you can get it everywhere . 
  i feel like it is slightly stereotypical of poles though i do n't know why . 
  perhaps because it 's a socialist-looking but still luxurious dish . 
  also because my poland-born grandma liked it . 
  your expression of the relationship between a northerner and his traditional food is pure poetry . 
  you think ? 
  yeah we have the same food and it seems like a really bad idea . 
  * maybe * you would have it in an outside restaurant but why do that when you can eat shashlik instead . 
  and we never eat it at parties because that would just be depressing as fuck :(, 
  that sounds soo messy, 
  ... ** w ** ** a ** ** t ** ** ? 
  ** now i 'm kind of curious what you found that caused you to come to this conclusion about someone with half polish family, 
  i do n't think they really had threads about national dishes in those days ... this one is only about fifty years old , anyway . 
  maybe we ate twigs and leaves . 
  you have , it 's just not that awesome and amazing, 
  jeezzzz you must have the fresh potato with peel , boil it and then fry it in oil , and sprinkle that `` potato spice '' from the supermarket on top , it 's heavenly i tell you . 
  i do n't know what 's in it but i do n't care, 
  ... jesus it 's no wonder when i visited poland i had to go to a russian restaurant just to survive . 
  screw all of your shit . 
  zraz does n't taste good either !, 
  yeah it kinda sounds like the `` you guyyyys i 'm so eastern european my eyebrows have eyebrows , check out thith fabulous borscht my slavic babushka taught me how to make '' thing . 
  omfg they 're dumplings , no one gives a shit . 
  can i ask something . 
  what 's with polan and pierogi ? 
  they 're just dumplings , every country from china to africa has them , it 's the default food when your parents spend all money on alcohol before pay day and it 's as generic as flour and filling . 
  why are people proud of this ? 
  are dumplings rare in other countries ? 
  or is it some sort of joke, 
  i know it exists , but it somehow never registered as an option to eat , maybe since i tend to go for slightly more exotic foods like mettwurst , spaetzle , weisswurst etc that i ca n't get at home ... 
  the indie fedoras ? 
  not so much . 
  think / r/lewronggeneration but with british bands from 2005 . 
  durka durka pierogi appropriating my culture . 
  do not dare . 
  i actually had no idea this was traditional german , never ate it and did n't really see it at traditional german restaurants where i ate ( only when passing by random crappy places in the street ) . 
  maybe i just block such things out . 
  did you catch the frogs yourselves too ? 
  history students are the most fun people i 've ever met . 
  the study and work prospects ... are not the main issue anyway . 
  haha , what would be the point of food without meat ? 
  it does n't have to be meat though , you can also put mushrooms or curd , or maybe something more creative . 
  but that is all blasphemy , of course . 
  you will have fun . 
  cepelinai , that potato thing with meat inside . 
  i took a bite out of my boyfriend 's plate when he was visiting lithuania and trying its national treasures a few months ago . 
  he liked it a lot more than i did , which i want expecting . 
  i do n't know much but i started following a lebanese blogger way back during the israel/hezbollah thing to find out what is like living in a warzone , and she made the country sound really cool . 
  she also made my favorite guide to drawing people of different ethnicities , ca n't link cause on mobile , but check out joumana medlej . 
  that 's my own connection to the place . 
  christianity attempts to reach out to modern youth . 
  i learned in linguistics that english compounds written with spaces are grammatically considered words , and certainly act so in a syntactic sense .
