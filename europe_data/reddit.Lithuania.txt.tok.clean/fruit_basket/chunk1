eh , i do n't know . 
  it 's difficult to talk about what would happen if something else did n't happen . 
  it 's just guessing . 
  so yea , i guess that the lithuanians living in vilnius would 've started an uprising and freed themselves , just like all other lithuanians did with the soviet union . 
   how is this soviets-helped-territorial-gain perceived ? 
  i do n't think there was such a thing . 
  they did n't just take those lands and give them back to lithuania . 
  they took them and kept them . 
  we had to fight the russians to get those lands back . 
  thousands died . 
  if you ask older people ( those who still remember everything ) , many will tell you that the nazi soldiers were actually better . 
  why on earth would you buy a pack of water with your last money ? 
  well , it is supposed to taste [ weirdly ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nitlob098w8 ) . 
  the trick is to keep it refrigerated and drink it fresh . 
  it acquires this salty taste after it sits for a while . 
  they were n't too exaggerated for lithuania , to be fair . 
  the chick is not out of this world either , but that 's a good thing , 
  in lithuania it is known as the pose of a nesting eagle . 
  huh ? 
  i 'm not swearing , her official title is `` a stupid fucking idiot chairman of the parliament '' . 
  our government has an infestation problem , too many russians in it . 
  no idea . 
  it 's probably for the best that she did n't go there . 
  she would 've tried to speak in english and that would be very cringeworthy . 
  ** lithuania ** our stupid fucking idiot chairman of the parliament decided to cancel her plans to go to uk for a meeting with their heads of the government , she did this literally on the last day before the trip . 
  then she went to motherfucking ukraine to that pro-eu rally . 
  dumb cunt did n't achieve anything , made herself look like a fool and wasted a huge pile of money that was spent planning her trip to the uk . 
  no one in ukraine understood why was she there . 
  we did n't understand it either . 
  lithuania reporting in . 
  the people are mostly fine , but the government ? 
  a bunch of dicks . 
  there 's only problems from them , they recently banned all our dairy products for some unclear reason . 
  they claimed that the quality was poor , but not one of other dozens of countries said anything like that . 
  we export dairy to many places all around the world . 
  they also still deny that they ever occupied us . 
  they refuse to pay reparations for the war damage . 
  they ignore thousands upon thousands of people they killed or sent to siberia ( which was probably worse than being shot , because it killed you slowly ) . 
  then there 's the whole nuclear power plant mess , they want to be a part of it , we do n't want them to . 
  some politicians ( we have a couple russians in the government , who have lithuanian citizenship and got elected through some miracle ) support that . 
  one of our past presidents was found to be friends with a rich russian businessman , took bribes from him and shit . 
  the president had to be kicked out of the office and barred from ever taking a position where taking an oath is required , since he broke one already . 
  he 's now crying to the eu commission about how this was unfair and is trying to get back into the government . 
  only pain and suffering from them , nothing more . 
  there still is potato , although banning that would leave more for latvians . 
  it was the temporary capital while vilnius was occupied by the polish during wwii . 
  at least four other cities had the title of lithuanian capital before kaunas . 
  it 's not about the actual effect , it 's about a political statement . 
  maybe we ca n't achieve it , but we can dream . 
  they 've been causing us trouble for decades and this is pretty much the only thing where they depend on us . 
  and yet still if we try to get back at them and close the transit routes , they will do something much worse for us . 
  as a result , we do n't . 
  we still hate russia and dream of being completely independent from them one day . 
  we 've already been in a union with russia . 
  we do n't want that again . 
  we allow them to transport products and people into kaliningrad by tranzit . 
  unwillingly , but we have to . 
  otherwise russia will impose yet another embargo on us and that will hurt . 
  another thing to note is that we rely heavily on russian gas ( gazprom ) for heating and cooking . 
  without it life would be tough , and gazprom does whatever putin says , so ... an lpg terminal is being built right now in our only sea port , hopefully it will allow us to be more independent . 
  the lithuanian name `` jonas '' was only the seventh most popular name in 2012 , according to the source . 
  eleventh the year before that . 
  `` matas '' was the most popular for two years in a row . 
  three decades ago ? 
  maybe . 
  today ? 
  definitely not . 
  ahh , you 've got glass ? 
  i remember when we did n't have such laws . 
  in some restaurants half was for smokers and half was for non-smokers . 
  those two sides were not separated by anything . 
  some non-smokers got to sit at a table that was right next to a smokers ' table . 
  oh wait , you still have n't ? 
  man , i thought the whole eu already did it . 
  i mean , it 's banned even in spain , which is not really known for following such laws . 
  you banned smoking in restaurants after we did . 
  visiting in that period of time was interesting , it looked kind of dirty . 
  lithuania most popular : typical lagers , like \u0160vyturys extra , utenos , kalnapilis pilsner . 
  \u0160vyturys one won a gold medal in world beer awards not so long ago . 
  best : there are multiple little breweries that only make a very limited amount of beer . 
  you can either buy it from them directly , or you can find it in various city fairs . 
  best beers to note would be varniuk\u0173 , vilniaus kvietinis and maybe a few others that i ca n't remember right now . 
  some people call basketball our second religion ( technically most of us are christians ) , even more people call it the first religion ( not many of us are * actual * christians ) , because basketball is everywhere . 
  biggest arenas in the country are built specifically for basketball and if there 's a game being broadcasted , you can be sure as hell that it will be on every single tv in every pub , bar and restaurant in the country . 
  sucks for those who are not really into it , but eh . 
  ** lithuania ** - basketball all over the fucking place ( championship is going on in slovenia and our team is there ) , first pages of major newspapers , all news websites , etc. 
  i do n't like basketball . 
  - vilnius marathon took place today , over 10 000 people participated . 
  first place for men went to some lithuanian dude , first one among women was some old norwegian lady . 
  - then there was some more basketball , because how could anyone live for more than half a day without it . 
  - russians are being dicks again and spending way too much time checking the lithuanian trucks at the border . 
  they check every single item on board , often take samples for testing . 
  russia has not clarified why they 're doing this , and why only to lithuanian trucks . 
  - yet another singing contest started , yet again a shitload of somewhat decent but boring people trying their luck . 
  - lithuanian presidency for the eu is still going on . 
  they 're talking about helping new companies , investing into new businesses , aiding the growth of the economy and all that stuff . 
  also discussing matters about syria . 
  parking in a few main streets of the capital is now forbidden , so that sucks . 
  it 's going on quite well , the economy is growing , things are looking good . 
  as for russia , we 're still pissed at them because they deny that they ever occupied us .
