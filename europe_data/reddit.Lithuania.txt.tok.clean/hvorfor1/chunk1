i really like that band haha , was a bit popular in lithuania at some point too, 
  as a great * daughter * of my country i 'd like it if we were included in the song too though . 
  in our anthem we have similar lines but when several artists sang it with the genders swapped they literally got arrested for `` disgracing lithuanian symbolics '' . 
  made me raise an eyebrow . 
  well occasionally in lithuanian restaurants you can see fish being labelled as `` vegetarian '' so ... 
  i have no energy to name all of the parties we have in the small lithuania ... 
  but the majority is right or right-leaning . 
  currently leading : a `` green '' party ( lv\u017ds ) , pretty radical right ; `` socialdemocrats '' ( lsdp ) i used to vote for them but they disappoint me with the lack of actual leftism so i stopped ; christian democrats ( ts-lkd ) , what you see is what you get , just your usual right party ; liberals ( ls ) , i think the best of the `` big '' parties in terms of social values and i 'd like it if they had more seats . 
  i voted this year for the actual green party ( l\u017dp ) but they are very small and did n't even make it past the 5 % . 
  1 person got a seat so i 'm glad though . 
  so i 'd say they are my favourite party , they seem the most modern and left , pro-lgbt , feminist , also they actually care about the environment and animal rights . 
  also as i said , i quite like the liberals since they are also modern , pro-lgbt and feminist but i dislike them from other points of view . 
  and to dislike there are really many . 
  starting with small , insignificant , openly fascist parties , ending with the second biggest party ( ts-lkd ) . 
  right wing is in general pretty big in lithuania . 
  i think i like something every year but this one is probably the best since it 's so old and i still remember : [ switzerland 2005 , vanilla ninja - cool vibes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdkqtax31h4 ) some recent ones i liked : [ spain 2015 , edurne - amanecer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-g92hnnbpq ) [ germany 2016 , jamie-lee - ghost ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-z7pkopp9s ) [ sweden 2014 , sanna nielsen - undo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pqji-3lw-8 ), 
  lol nobody that i know of eats meat at * midnight * . 
  but being in klaip\u0117da always feels like being abroad to me anyway . 
  my mom is a big fan of her , there are really many of her books in our apartment . 
  i have read a few too . 
  i know that people do stuff on the 25th , but never my family , so i don\u00e4t know what exactly, 
   in slavic countries almost got `` triggered '' . 
  but here it used to be common to have wild boar meat on the table , this disappeared after christianity , now meat is eaten during the day time of 25th . 
  sweetsour i 'd say . 
  lots of sugar . 
  we have . 
  food is probably similar to the rest of the baltic countries and kind of similar to the nordic ones , just after christianization the only meat `` allowed '' on the 24th is fish , usually all kinds of herring . 
  to make a statement that christmas is a pagan celebration , i 'd always bring reindeer sausages to the table ( nobody in my family minds it , they rather appreciate that i 'm interested in lithuanian culture ) . 
  usually there are 9 or 12 meals . 
  herring aside , what we typically have on our table and what one would commonly find on someone else 's table : [ k\u016b\u010diukai ] ( http://www.15min.lt/images/photos/616350/big/pagerinti-kuciukai-52b015b30ddbf.jpg ) - probably the most important meal [ kisielius ] ( http://s1.15min.lt/static/cache/odgwedu4mcwznzf4mjk3ldyxnjm1mcxvcmlnaw5hbcwsnda4nti0ndkznw==/spanguoliu-kisielius-52a058ceea4c1.jpg ) - a thick lingon drink [ aguonpienis ] ( http://www.lithuania.travel/files_ftp/presentation/uploads/produktai/pp_kulinarinis_img/08.png ) - sweet/tasteless poppy seed drink [ mushroom pastries ] ( http://atinabc.blox.pl/resource/paszteciki_z_kapusta_i_grzybami2.jpg ) - mushroom picking is very big in lithuania and many people , including me , dry self-picked mushrooms in autumn to use for this purpose also various kinds of breads . 
  on the 25th there 's more food but we never really do it . 
  on the idea level i 'm against conscription in general but i 'm a bit brainwashed by the military propaganda so if there was war and i were drafted , i would n't say anything negative . 
   it 's also likely that this time around it will be gender-neutral . 
  the only fair way to do it , if we say that conscription itself is fair . 
  i really liked one picture in the arm\u00e9museum , it said that there was never a universal conscription in sweden because it was always just for the guys . 
  warmed my heart . 
  oh no , what now, 
  i often work till 6:00 and this is the best . 
  after work i do n't have the crushing feeling that people around me just woke up and are starting their day and i 'm groggy and tired just going to bed . 
  instead it just feels like late evening . 
  the negative side is that when i wake up it 's already kind of dark too so i barely see any sunlight . 
  but it 's also cozy . 
   visvaldis , laimonis ahaa we have these !, 
  visvaldas and laimonas, 
  lol my name is like that it 's literally a word for the ancient people who lived in the baltic territory . 
  there is a small chance that some similar name exists in latvia or estonia but i 've never heard . 
  not hard to pronounce but foreigners always feel unsure doing it since it 's usually the first time they see it . 
  we also have many names that are normal lithuanian words with meaning , usually something related to nature . 
  like \u017dibut\u0117 ( violet ) , au\u0161ra ( dawn ) , deimantas ( diamond ) , etc. 
  so they do n't exist anywhere else either i guess , unless the word is similar . 
  i speak lithuanian ( native ) , english ( second ) and swedish ( third ) . 
  i also understand/speak a little bit of russian but i do n't use it so this skill is fading very fast . 
  at some point i spoke french ( self learned ) but i lost interest in it , stopped using and now i could barely make a sentence . 
  english was mandatory in my school since the 2nd grade . 
  in some other schools there can be some other language instead , like french or german . 
  also in the 9th grade it was mandatory to pick a 3rd language , in my school it was either german or russian ( i picked russian ) . 
  we in lithuania also have quite a big population of non-native spanish speakers . 
  people who do n't speak any other language are considered low intelligence because how could they have not developed this skill in such a small country . 
  i mean you ca n't use lithuanian anywhere else . 
  that 's the only comment in this thread that makes sense . 
  every day on the news they cover something about what happens in aleppo recently , show some footage of wrecked places , civilians talking . 
  also there seems to be some sort of additional sentiment suggesting that russia is the real bad side . 
  this is very unusual . 
  no one really approaches people with small talk , they might approach you if they have some problem with your existence , but not like to ask how you 're doing for no reason . 
  i do n't think this has ever happened to me in lithuania , either it was something on the harassment spectrum or some situation where one had a reason to approach me . 
  but once in norway some guy started smalltalking to me on a bus , i felt very alerted and uncomfortable and with no skills to avoid it politely so i just kind of went along with it . 
  [ jazzu & leon somov ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwzvtkqfxhw ) i hate to admit it that i kind of like her music because , at least as much i see on tv , her personality seems pretty horrible [ gjan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegryclkts4 ) her newest song . 
  in my opinion , one of the best local music artists . 
  pretty popular here , but still relatively unknown even though she 's been around for like 5 years ... probably because her manager is still her boyfriend , idk [ mango ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdr6xs8k1pi ) pretty bad in my opinion but they have been around since 1998 according to wiki , so there has to be something that people like about them [ marijonas mikutavi\u010dius ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1t6wwcyrmw ) very popular guy . 
  i kind of ca n't stand him , not even the music itself but maybe his voice or overly dramatic lyrics and media personality ... 
  but he has been around very long too, 
  we have a club called `` liverpool '' where they play music of these and other similar bands and have gigs of local indie bands :d, 
  sweden , 
  well firstly not everyone wants to display their marital status at all times . 
  secondly , this only applies to women , men usually keep the same surname all through the lifetime . 
  [ swedish salad ] ( http://www.kkf.lt/data/catalog/large/marinatai_svediskos_salotos.jpg ) it 's just cucumber with some grass ... why does it have a name in the first place, 
  turkey used to be the absolute must . 
  recently , because of the conflicts , it 's not so popular anymore though . 
  spain is very popular , also the city of prague . 
  i have n't been to any of those :d, 
  absolutely subjective . 
  for me it 's sweden because from lule\u00e5 to malm\u00f6 , i personally have seen really many guys of `` my type '' there . 
  on the other side , at this point possibly if presented with an okay looking guy , i 'd find him more attractive after learning he 's swedish . 
  and i think girls of every type are attractive so i 'd find pretty much equal percentage of attractive girls in any country . 
  maybe i should question my heterosexuality . 
  i understand but what about hybrids/electric cars then ? 
  are they taxed the same ? 
  :d i was learning some basics of norwegian so just took a random word upon creating a username . 
  it 's like my 236th reddit account so creativity has run out . 
  well son and father do n't have different surnames to show the same thing ... 
  right :d, 
  are n't cars in norway taxed high for the purpose that people would own less cars with co2 emission ? 
  i wanted to name something but i guess i 'm easy to please . 
  i loved literally every natural landscape i 've been to in europe . 
  i really want to visit someday . 
  seems like a better version of the usa and has many good bands . 
  also beautiful winter and mountains . 
  if i lived in the usa i 'd move to canada . 
  ^ that 's my subjective opinion based on small particles of information and exposure to canada i get . 
  married ending = '' - ien\u0117 '' unmarried endings = '' - yt\u0117 '' , '' - ait\u0117 '' , '' - \u016bt\u0117 '' oh there is also a novelty `` neutral '' ending '' - \u0117 '' ( `` kat\u0117 '' instead of `` katien\u0117 '' or `` katait\u0117 '' ) but it 's not very effective because nobody really gives a newborn daughter an '' - \u0117 '' surname ( or it 's uncommon ) , she gets the `` unmarried '' version so unless she changed it at some point , she 's 90 % married and changed the surname , if the surname is '' - \u0117 '' .
