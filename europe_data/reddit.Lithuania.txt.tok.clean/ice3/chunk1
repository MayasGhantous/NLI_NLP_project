it might be easier to try to deconstruct long words into simpler ones . 
  \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c = \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 ( worthy ) + \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c ( notice ) + suffix - \u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c , so the translation would be `` something that is worth noticing '' . 
  it 's not that different from sehens + w\u00fcrdigkeit - vision + worthiness ( if i got this correctly , my german is a bit rusty ) . 
   are you drunk by chance ? 
  in no way shape or form lithuanian * is * `` what you hear is what you write '' . 
  all that crap with * grammatical moods * and * cases * . 
  then there 's the fun * ny * business of * participial forms of the verb ( all 13 of them ) * . 
  it 's all fun and games until you need to whip out a table of rules in order to write out an otherwise simple word correctly . 
   as far as pitch accents go , i have never encountered them in in real life . 
   i dunno , maybe i 'm retarded , but lithuanian has been problematic for my whole life . 
  i reali * z * e that our language is unique and then there 's the whole patriotism deal . 
   but none of that matters because i hate it . 
  even if i 'm demonstrably wrong . 
  everyone is entitled to his/hers own opinion  all these things give unprecedented freedom of expressing oneself in the lithuanian language . 
  and not a lot of languages sound the same as read from text . 
  ( i 'm looking at you danish ! ), 
  the difficult part is writing the words as you hear them ( and here comes pitch accent ) . 
  if you know your high-school level ( 12 grade level ) lithuanian , you should be able to do that without too many problems . 
  and if that does n't help , there 's always something like `` juodos avys '' ( literally `` black sheep '' - it 's a specialized lithuanian language spell checking addon/dictionary for office ), 
  try to translate that . 
  our writing system is not that difficult . 
  what you hear is what you write and vice versa . 
  now pitch accent - that 's another story :d, 
  i like danish . 
  i 'm actually trying to learn it , but the pronunciation is killing me . 
  same in russian . 
  as a russian speaker - czech , slovak and polish all sound funny to me . 
  although there 's one more language that sounds like `` baby talk '' to me - slovenian it 's so damn cute , 
   * idiotic . 
  well , [ you 're ] ( https://xkcd.com/1386/ ) calling idiots more than half of the voters . 
   * not for people to decide the type of reactor , prof * f * essionals know what should be built where . 
  re-read my second point . 
  50-70 % operating factor . 
  that 's 30 to 50 % of all time spent in maintenance . 
   * you ca n't debate with general public on these types of projects , they are extremely uninformed on the subject . 
  i completely agree on this point . 
  it 's impossible to debate with people like you on these types of subjects . 
   * the way this project was planned we should have just shut up and took it , it was pretty much gifted to us . 
  yep . . lets disregard all of the personnel costs , the construction costs , the operational costs , fuel costs and so on . 
  now , i 'm not sure why you 're mentioned different types of reactors and being professional , as it takes just a couple of minutes to find out what kind of problems abwr have . 
  50-70 % [ operation factor ] ( http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/rds2-32_web.pdf ) just being [ one ] ( http://www.plux.co.uk/hitachi-abwr-one-of-the-least-reliable-in-the-world/ ) of them . 
  how about [ reliability ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/advanced_boiling_water_reactor#reliability ) [ issues ? 
  ] ( http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/rs-second-regulatory-issue-raised-with-uk-abwr-17071501.html ) why not take an [ epr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epr_ ( nuclear_reactor \\ ) ) design ? 
  which is marketed to have ~ 90 % operation factor ? 
  or why not take all those billions of $ and invest it somewhere else ? 
  as far as i know , chernobyl was caused by lack of trained personel , crazy tests and complete disregard for safety procedures . 
  does that mean that you 'd like another chernobyl-like ( rbmk ) reactor , even with trained personel and all the right procedures ? 
  ^ ^ ^ oh ^ ^ ^ wait , ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ already ^ ^ ^ had ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ those ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ closed ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ down ^ ^ ^ anyway . 
  in any case i do n't want any reactor made by hitachi on lithuanian soil . 
  ( be it my personal opinion ), 
  well . 
  i 'm one of those who voted against the new nuclear power plant . 
  ones who you call ` cunts ' ( hey you just called cunts more that half of people who voted !, 
  you must really hate democracy . ) . 
  now why i voted against is rather simple . 
  ** i ** do n't want a reactor from a company that did reactors in fukushima . 
  i do n't want a abwr with an operating factor of 50-70 % . 
  the whole project was pushed through without too much debate or discussion . 
  they even did not want to recognise the results of the referendum !, 
  i 'm glad that the whole topic became a political suicide for anyone who touched it . 
  now , if i had a choice of which type of a reactor to build i would gladly vote for some gen ~ ~ iv ~ ~ iii + reactor which could be used to reprocess all the nuclear waste that we have lying around . 
  ( like a candu reactor ) but since i was n't given that choice i voted against . 
  i would better see the money go into a project like nordbalt or ` independence ' or better yet , into alternative power . 
  so , before commenting , do some research on your own . 
  because the way you 're presenting your view point is ... cunty . 
  in lithuanian - olandija and nyderlandai, 
  here you go , translated to american : first picture :  be alert , y' all be watching both sides second picture :  warnin ' , warnin '  th ' tram is as heavy as 40 adult bisons  is it easy t ` stop it ? 
  lithuania is awesome . 
  ^ ^ ^ signed : ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ russian ^ ^ ^ speaker ^ ^ ^ living ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ lithuania, 
  and again , you keep throwing lithuania , latvia and estonia into the same pile . 
  i 'm only talking about lithuania in my posts . 
  my surname is one of those that end in - \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 and here it 's transliterated into - skij . 
  do n't like it ? 
  go to the metrication office and change it . 
  nobody will stop you . 
  edit : i 'll also add lithuanian versions here : balodis - balov - balovas ozoli\u0146\u0161 - ozolov - ozolovas godmanis - godov - godovas the reason for - as endings is the language grammar itself . 
  without the ending , the word does n't have a `` meaning '' , it also means a thing and not a person . 
  also , without the proper ending it does n't change cases ... so there is a reason why we have an `` aleksandras pu\u0161kinas '' but , without knowing the language and its history , this does n't really tell you anything , does it ? 
  consider this - ivan balov would n't make a proper name in antient latin as well , ivanus balovus would . 
  my name and surname are not translated . 
  they are transliterated , yep , but still sound the same in lithuanian as in russian . 
  and soon - we 'll have an option to have an alternative spelling of your name in your passport as well : russian polish even chinese . 
  yep , same here . 
  they might watch russian tv and say that putin is right , but as soon as you ask them whether they 'd move to russia , they all say - no ! . 
  forcing us to learn russian ? 
  nah ... it 's an option in school , a very popular one at that . 
  heck , we have russian schools here as well . 
  just a few more points : 1 . 
  i have a russian name and surname . 
  i do n't look like a local . 
  i 've learned the language to integrate . 
  i have never experienced any opression or discrimination here because of the things i 've mentioned above . 
  now if you 're living in a coutry for more than 25 years , do try to follow the local customs . 
  learn the language , have ** respect ** for the local culture and people . 
  or , you can take the route some local russians took - do n't learn the language , get a shit job , complain all your life that it 's the state 's fault , be a loser for the rest of your life . 
   spoiler : give them more rights , stop honoring nazi-collaborators more rights than the locals ? 
  do elaborate . 
  i have the same rights as everyone here , not more , not less . 
  ( do note , i 'm in lithuania , we do n't have any of that `` non-citizen '' boolshit ) nazi-collaborators ... well , there 's a bit of that . 
  we have nationalists and ** gasp ** we actually honor their rights - freedom of assembly and freedom of expression .
