talking about best korea , have you seen how rt shows it ? 
   i do n't think that in 1990-2004 period russia did anything particularly hostile towards eastern european countries . 
  not true . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_omon_assaults_on_lithuanian_border_posts https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania ) economical embargo that followed after . 
  constant intrusions into the baltic energy system , threats to not sell our local oil company to americans , active spy network . 
  slovenia , cmon , i thought better of you ... 
  well he said `` new eu-members have to join '' , so maybe that loophole is somehow corrected for newcomers so that they could n't take sweden 's path ? 
  seen better .

  you should put / s at the end of your post , i 'm afraid there will be some geniuses who will take it literally . 
  also , one of great examples of russian '' \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0435 '' and '' \u0434\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c '' vs corrupted consumerism and moral decay of us : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=438sgy9ie58 ( turn on subtitles ), 
  you mean there 's no place for loopholes anymore ? 
  do you know it for sure ? 
  cause it does n't sound realistic to me . 
   or are the brics very quiet ? 
  they are . 
  basically all this brics+r ussia = heart that many russians out there on the interwebz are really into , is just a russian propaganda doing its job . 
  nobody cares about r , brics is not some political alliance or anything . 
  they are looking out for their economical interests and sure as hell they are choosing western world for their trading partners and not glorious russia . 
  such is life, 
  i 'll start off with lithuania : premium pass : 440ltl ( $ 127 ) league pass : 330ltl ( $ 96 ), 
  exactly . 
  symbol for eu tho could be europarl building in brussels . 
   pre-baltic people that 's not a word lol . 
  you meant pribaltika ? 
  actually we do n't even like this term in russian ( tho i myself do n't see anything wrong with it , it 's just how russians translate `` baltic '' ) . 
  some say however , that `` pri '' makes it offensive and demeaning , and that proper way to say it even in russian should be baltika . 
  anyways , while it 's a gray zone in russian , it 's definitely not pre-baltic in english , 
  i understand what you are saying , and i am not arguing about that . 
  the fact is tho , that initial * military * operation was done well , quick , with precision . 
  \u041d\u0438\u0447\u0451 , \u0432\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0451\u043c \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043c\u0441\u044f  europeans are not as stupid as you think  yeah , they may not have believed us ( baltics and poles ) when we were saying that russia is dangerous 10-15 years ago , but now they understand it quite well i believe . 
  they see xyulo as he is . 
  also , a sweet melach for you . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driy8my6j9y from yesterday 's euroleague game in kaunas , \u017dalgiris - unics kazan . 
   i do n't watch rt. 
  most of my information comes from relatives who live in the area . 
  who watches russian propaganda and believe it as a holy bible . 
  operation on itself was very successful . 
  governing that followed was not . 
  one could argue that it would n't be the case in ukraine . 
  did they at least raise your wage after the rubble exchange rate dropped ? 
  wrong universe . 
  believe it or not but right now i ` m on my 4 ( ? ), 
  years old back-up laptop which runs windows vista !, 
  ca n't complain actually . 
  got nothing to contribute , just out of curiosity , what kind of field is this ? 
  my eyes hurt . 
  can you remember which season/episode was that ? 
  well it 's not a bad thing on its own . 
  probably . 
  tho it 's not so bad compared to the fact that women did not have sanitary napkins . 
  they had to use cotton and stuff like that . 
  those were deficit too however , and black market existed for those . 
  mainly doctors were stealing it from hospitals and selling or exchanging for sausages .

  tell me about it, 
  you do ? 
  why did n't you say it before . 
  now we have to change the law cause / u/binnedcrumble * guarantees * it, 
  for some reason you are under the assumption that i am discussing or arguing with you . 
  you are just yet another vatnik and i know it 's bezpolezno to do so , cause morons like you showed it time after time that you are incapable of seeing things as they are , even if there are video evidence . 
  you follow blindly everything what kremlin tv says and then accuse europeans to be under the influence of anti-russian propaganda . 
  to sum up you are just a moron . 
  actually most of the world do understand , except for morons from russia like you . 
  i see you like that phrase very much . 
  can you imagine tho germans calling jewish people butthurt ? 
  russians came , raped us , still hold imperialistic ambitions , and then joke `` ohh , do n't be so butthurt '' . 
  you are moron . 
  i 'm just stating the truth . 
   `` but what about israel and swastika ? '' . 
   clearly not whataboutism . 
  you are fucking moron . 
  i gave a simple example . 
  whataboutism would have had been if i said something along the lines `` well , in moscow they are attacking pro-ukrainian protesters in the daylight and police are n't doing nothing '' . 
  see the difference ? 
  now about the links you provided . 
  when someone says `` pro-russians in ukraine are being attacked '' or something , it implies that the guy who voted for russian party is getting beaten up while he 's minding his own business , going to work etc. 
  this does not happen . 
  it 's entirely different thing if you show up in the massive gathering of angry opposing mob and start expressing your opinion or drive around the town with the symbol of the country you are at war with . 
  it 's not whatabaoutism you moron . 
  pro-russians are n't being beaten up because of their world view and whatnot and that 's a fact . 
  but if you put symbol of neighboring imperialistic country which is invading your homeland right now and drive around , then it 's no surprise you will get some attention . 
  put the swastika on your car and drive around israel , see what happens, 
  im on my phone . 
  bit hard to answer properly . 
  main idea is basic : no one is hurting pro-russian citizens , they were free to come to elections . 
  not all opposition . 
  just the pro-russian one . 
  they act in the interest of another state and do not deny it , that 's why they are called 5th column . 
  poroshenko illegitimate ? 
  these elections do not count ? 
  absolutely nothing . 
  i think you are confusing cities controlled by ukrainians and the ones under russian separatist control . 
  from time to time some old morons even gather to shout some pro-russian shit in the town square . 
  seen some videos when some drunk moron shouts pro-russian shit in the streets and ... nothing . 
  normal people just laugh at him and ignore . 
  and what ate you suggesting anyways ? 
  that banderanazis were looking into your soul when some pro-russian came to vote and acted accordingly ? 
  it was provocateur from pravy sektor , and that video was shot in hollywood by request of cia . 
  well they are a 5th column by definition .
