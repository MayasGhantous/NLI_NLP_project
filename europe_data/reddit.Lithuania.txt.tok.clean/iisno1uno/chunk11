  just a year ago no one in russia would have justified anything in resemblance of military actions in ukraine , and now everyday more and more people are actively calling for it . 
  and why ? 
  just because they overthrew their corrupted government . 
  and shows like this ... you can not show images like this on your national tv in the primetime and expect nothing bad will happen . 
  i know i just seem another lithuanian being paranoically afraid of russia 's aggression , but i 'm telling you - society will explode . 
  i will not use phrases like wwiii ( i did just know haha ) , but something major will happen in the near future . 
  everything is going downhill on a extremely fast pace . 
  i am actually impressed how you got the lithuanian situation right . 
  the outside picture you used is the picture of the old parliament building . 
  the inside picture you used is the view in the new additional building built few years ago for plenary sessions . 
  outside of that part of the building looks like [ this ] ( http://alkas.lt/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/seimas.jpg ) . 
  it seems very unlikely that we had less factories . 
  nuclear plant , oil company , one of the biggest in europe crt producer , refrigerators snaig\u0117 , tv 's \u0160ilelis , chemical industry producer achema . 
  however , with the exception of nuclear plant , most of the workers were locals . 
  do n't know how much truth is to that , but a lot of people say that first secretary of lithuanian cp thought against russification . 
  some say that kaliningrad was proposed to be joined under the lithuanian ssr , and snie\u010dkus rejected it . 
  wiki :  during the later decades of snie\u010dkus 's rule national orientation was noticeable in his activities . 
  first confrontation with moscow happened in 1949-1950 , when he had to defend his old communist friends from persecution , with whom he was together working in underground . 
  lithuania was the only republic of ussr where not only mass persecution of old communists did not happen and not even one communist of pre-soviet times was accused and arrested . 
  at around this time his policies started to gain a national character . 
  this policy had the form of sabotaging some orders of moscow , demanding some privileges for lithuania , and others . 
  these russians live in a parallel universe , i tell you . 
  at this point russia is much more closer to n. korea than china is . 
  as / u/hmunkey said , there 's not much we export to usa . 
  you should have more luck finding polish products . 
  if you do drink beer , i heard lithuanian beer * \u0160vyturys * can be found in american supermarkets . 
  and it 's not bad at all . 
  do n't know how much truth is to that , but our top politicians say gdp will take 0.2 % hit . 
  our media said that russia will ( probably ) make exceptions for kaliningrad . 
  have you ordered electronics recently ? 
  cause i tried to just a month ago , and it was n't available . 
  had to go to co.uk and pay ~ 10 % more . 
  does n't german amazon ship only books and some other cheap/small stuff ? 
  is n't gdp/hour an index of productivity ? 
  cmon now . 
  starvation is a bit of overreach . 
  lol . 
  thought it was how much hours does one person work . 
  productivity is what matters, 
  how do you even watch porn ? 
  it sounds exactly the same, 
   bucharest 's trolley looks like a transformer ... for some reason it reminded me of [ honey badger ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7whmg5yjg ) . 
  * he just does n't give a shit * . 
  initially . 
  he is talking about present time tho . 
  have they ever ? 
  one thing i can say for sure - winter is coming . 
  there a lot of good answers and none wrong ones . 
  i would suggest to travel as much as you can . 
  lyon definitely has good location to do that . 
  use trains to travel around ( germany/benelux/italy / spain/austria/swiss / czhech ) . 
  for scandinavia , poland , baltics , greece use air travel . 
  if you can leave and enter schengen area multiple times feel free to to visit even minsk , serbia , istanbul , and obviously uk . 
  every country and region has it 's own flavor . 
  it 's worth to try to experience that . 
  as two extremes i would suggest iceland and [ blue lagoon ] ( https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/blue_lagoon ) during winter . 
  what about seiing [ that ] ( https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/northern_lights ) with your own eyes . 
  other extreme being greece and [ santorini ] ( http://www.blamethemonkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/elia-locardi-sunset-dreams-oia-santorini-1440-wm-dm-60.jpg ) during summer . 
  as a lithuanian i am obliged to encourage you to visit vilnius/trakai during the spring , when there are some top quality cultural/traditional events . 
  and obviously [ curonian spit ] ( http://www.lietuva.lt/uploads/news/images/186_742a0381b8701f6ede8c5d2b53726036.jpg ) . 
   soviet legacy that 's definitely something to be proud of !, 
  interwar period was romanticized cause we needed to remind ourselves during soviet occupation that we were free and independent not so long ago !, 
  and obviously we lived way better in those times than we did under soviet rule . 
  tho by today 's standards interwar was n't great at all . 
  jogaila definitely is n't our favorite historical personality . 
  and \u017de\u010dpospolita is n't favorite period knowing how it ended . 
  oh my , so much memories itt !, 
  home and away ... everyone watched that show . 
  by everyone i mean kids and old ladies . 
  it 's timeslot was sunday mornings , workdays after school , etc. 
  it was really one of the first foreign tv shows on lithuanian tv ( if not the first one ) . 
  it was called * be nam\u0173 negerai * in lithuanian , meaning * it 's bad without home * . 
  well , duh ... 
  man i remember watching pole chudes as a kid . 
  did n't know any better . 
  i doubt there was a show when someone did not gifted home made pickles to the show . 
   the most cringeworthy moments are when the guests sing and when the host makes incredibly uncomfortable conversations with their kids . 
  i heard rumours that he really * loves * kids . 
  really too much . 
  so much that he should meet chris hansen . 
  any truth to it ? 
  or is it just a urban legend based on these cringeworthy moments on the show ? 
  is russia in europe ? 
  cause i may have some suggestions that are better ( worse ) then charleroi . 
   i personally think ukraine should be a full member of nato even ukraine does n't think that . 
  their army is very divided , underfunded , unprofessional and disloyal . 
  they would need to 10 + years to be able to join nato . 
  clear and public political commitment tho is a good way to start , and not even that has been yet . 
   and russia should be attacked . 
  it 's straight up delusion . 
  not even gon na comment that one . 
  i do n't know a single person my age who 's lactose intolerant . 
  the first time i heard that was a thing was from an american tv . 
  so yeah , i believe this map is just a bs . 
  maybe they mean '' % of people who have some gene who 's responsible for lactose intolerance '' . 
   so finnish and danish fighters ( stationed in estonia ) small correction - estonian base was n't used yet for stationing fighters . 
  danish fighters were stationed in \u0160iauliai , lithuania . 
  finish ones were in their homeland . 
  well they convicted some pro-western russians because of it ( iirc nobody was given actual jail time tho ) , so i thought you might have heard that story . 
  few years back before the putin election 2012 , eu financed a seminar for election observers .
