  it was held in one countryside farmstead near vilnius . 
  russian journalist crew decided to show up , since it was n't a secret or anything . 
  and obviously there were no security , gate was open as it is just a rural tourism object . 
  so they filmed a bit , till the manager showed up , and asked them to leave and not to disturb guests . 
  of course some time later this footage was used in media several times telling how lithuanians are teaching russian extremists to overthrow government . 
  since tv crew was able to shoot some faces of the attendants of the seminar before being confronted by manager , it was used in a court , lithuanian media says 16 people were fined . 
  some time later they used some of that footage telling how march of millions plan was created in lithuania . 
  tho the winner of absurdity contest was this year 's story , when they used same exact footage as the first time , but now telling stories how maidan activists were being taught here . 
  i know they were on a hurry , but cmon . . they even said it was filmed during this winter , tho there were no snow yet in lithuania ( unlike in the footage ) . 
  and it 's only one of few examples how they reuse footage and make up completely different story . 
  tho this one was definitely the funniest one since the name of the street * mano t\u0117vo gatv\u0117 * is quite funny in itself , meaning * my father 's street * . 
  unlimited budget ? 
  i would not be so sure . 
  have you heard about * mano t\u0117vo gatv\u0117 * story ? 
  are you an american ? 
  cause i have really hard time trying to understand what exactly are you trying to say . 
  the `` old '' president is out of play . 
  no one supports him anymore , he 's just a clown-puppet . 
  no one likes him in ukraine , no one likes him in russia . 
  putin does have insane imperialistic ambitions . 
  not sure about the exact plan . 
  i believe it 's quite spontaneous what he does . 
  1 thing is quite clear right now , he wants to create long-lasting conflict in ukraine , just as in georgia , moldova , armenia , azerbaijan . 
  and obviously his plan already worked to some point , since everyone already forgot how he annexed crimea . 
   most american media is portraying russia as the big bad guy ( again ) for supporting the rebels in ukraine ( even though they support the old regime so ... ) you are very very confused i 'm afraid . 
  read wiki article or something regarding this , you lack the basic knowledge . 
  and what about semifinals at [ sydney 2000 ] ( http://youtu.be/bnsetae_12k?t=3m39s ) , tomjanovich almost got a heart attack . 
  we had two messages in lithuanian press this week about russia 's media . 
  other one not so pleasant , saying [ russia pulls plug on ` last independent tv show ' ] ( https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/world/a/24617360/russia-pulls-plug-on-last-independent-tv-show/ ) . 
  can you comment on the latter one ? 
  was it really propaganda-free tv show on the mainstream media ?

  it 's a fkin headache and i hope we will stop using 1 and 2 cent coins for good . 
  tho it does n't seem possible in the near future . 
  even now we are using 1 lithuanian cent coin which is worth ~ 0.29 of 1 euro cent . 
  there were some discussion about removing them from the circulation while back , but i believe no one really bothered to do so since $ was coming . 
  and now obviously no politician will want to suggest that since everyone is afraid of increased prices as it is . 
  hopefully in a 5 years or so ... or maybe eu-wide policy could help . 
  at least it 's good to know that nordic press is also using titles like this to generate clicks . 
  there were stands in lithuanian grocery stores with dairy products made for russian market and then returned back from the russian border with some discount . 
  tho can you imagine international label `` banned in russia '' ? 
  with proper ad strategy it can be popular from romania to estonia . 
  they are called [ sutartin\u0117 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeenhlrteia ) , and they are in the damn unesco cultural heritage list . 
  i wo n't join on ridiculing him with you . 
  somehow he reminds me of walter white . 
  agreed . 
  only one of two dairy products i choose other local production , the other being valio yogurt . 
  do you let ukrainians and russians write their names using kirilica too ? 
  we have * sarmale * i believe !, 
  we call it * baland\u0117liai * ( little pigeons ) . 
  it looks exactly like a [ bulgarian ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:sarma_and_yugourt.jpg ) version pictured in wikipedia , only instead of yogurt we use sour cream . 
  absolutely delicious and fairly popular . 
  have tried few times * ardei umplu\u0163i * too , tho it 's not popular at all , and * sarmale * is definitely better . 
  i believe some homemakers over here do make * pl\u0103cint\u0103 * , tho do n't even know how it is called . 
  and obviously * slanina * . 
  i have my mouth full of saliva just thinking about it . 
  and very easy to make . 
  just some chopping required . 
  since there are a lot of versions of cold eastern european soups , there are few requirements for it to be called proper lithuanian * \u0160altibar\u0161\u010diai * . 
  kefir , boiled eggs , served with hot potato . 
  spoonful of sour cream may be added . 
  every other vegetable is probably standard in every recipe . 
  you really want to play the game of whataboutism ? 
  are you retard or just a child ? 
  [ grozny after war ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_eplyasgqxjg/tubqcjoe74i/aaaaaaaaab0/tt50yudmle0/s1600/groznymarch95.jpg ), 
  are you seriously trying to compare ukrainian conflict and chechen war ? 
  there 's no conflict in that area . 
  if you mean that lithuanian laws forbid multilingual street signs and passports , that is true . 
  yet in the region itself there are no conflicts whatsoever . 
  also , a map itself is n't accurate . 
  to the west from vilnius poles do not hold majority . 
   140 people were poisoned , 34 hospitalized in a youth putin 's supporters summer camp seliger because of serious violations of sanitary norms . 
  or was it because of ukrainians ? 
  we did . 
  easy .

  do you change your permanent summer/winter time two times a year ? 
   to pass a bill that will forbid foreigners to buy agricultural land haha , had the same proposal put to the referendum . 
  thankfully did not pass .

  flair up , cause now you ca n't into relevance . 
  still growing . 
  have n't they had enough ? 
  i have only same google as you do . 
  i was talking to my friend about a year ago about that stuff , she is historian and was doing research on numbers of lithuanian/latvian deportations , and also was looking into the prussian situation . 
  basically what she told me was that most of the prussians ran on their own . 
  the ones who stayed were either killed or deported ( they were called germans in the official documents of soviets ) . 
  after the war the books show that not a single resident that lived there before the war was resident also after . 
  so generally speaking 100 % of population were wiped out . 
  good ? 
  please define good , because in my dictionary , their military is pretty bad . 
  seriously , no idea why would you think their military is good . 
  they are trying to modernize it , obviously , tho generals do not even know how to do it . 
  for generations their understanding of the military structure was `` the more brute force the better '' . 
  their tactic in the battlefield was `` let 's keep sending men till we overcome '' . 
  look at every war they had during last and this century . 
  it 's a laughing matter really how they are bragging about being the liberators of europe during wwii . 
  remember winter war ? 
  yeah , they eventually won it , tho just look at the casualties .
