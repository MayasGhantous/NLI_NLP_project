  remember afghan war ? 
  another disgrace . 
  chechen 1st yet another . 
  and 2nd ? 
  do you believe they won it ? 
  think again . 
  they just made a deal with some chechen tribes/clans to put them in charge and to pay them monstrous amounts of monies . 
  kadyrev and co are carrying out killings in the daylight against russian fsb officers and everyone is afraid to do anything , because chechens won that war ( tho actually it is still going on , read on it ) . 
  georgia and 2008 ? 
  watch some documentaries . 
  russian soldiers were amazed by how good georgian soldiers lived . 
  do you know a word dedovschyna ? 
  it is still very much in place there and no one tries to stop it . 
  i could go on and on . 
  in one sentence - they are big , not good . 
  and they have nukes . 
  that 's their power . 
  2 million in kaliningrad before the war ? 
  where did you get such a number ? 
  are you counting population of gdansk and surroundings too ? 
  while exact numbers are hard impossible to know , basically not a single resident survived . 
  men were killed , women raped , children deported . 
  russians saw them as germans ( biggest enemy who burned their towns ) , and it were first lands of `` germans '' russians stepped in to . 
  that 's why these people felt the most cruel behavior by russians . 
  well again , you are not using context , rather you are fixating on wording . 
  eli5 : there are differences between people , like the skin pigmentation . 
  while it does not matter , it does n't mean that differences do not exist . 
  `` race does n't matter '' does not equal `` race does n't exist '' . 
  we are not robots , we are smart human beings , we and our kids should be able to tell the difference because of context . 
  i guarantee you this poster has nothing to do with that chant, 
   so those 70k of course would n't win 50k russian soldiers because of the better hardware , better preparation and experience on russian side . 
  basically you need to defend with pistols only to lose against smaller attacking army . 
  i do n't believe there 's such a disparity between the armies . 
  should i provide you with the links of lithuanian tourism organizations and schedule of the nearest airport of palanga ? 
   xx-xxi century russia is all about conquering and imperialism . 
  i 'm not historian so i do n't know where it came from most if not all countries/nations of the world have had imperialistic ambitions at some point throughout the history , however these ambitions never were forgotten by russians and grow stronger every day . 
  there are many reasons for that . 
  imagine russian looking at the map , seeing how big their country is and yet so poor , weak . 
  do n't know how ( if ) gene pool works , tho culturally mongolians have played a major [ role ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_invasion_of_rus'#influence_on_rus.27_society ) which lasts till this day i guess . 
  i feel the beauty of your words , sadly i would like to remind you that at least name russia is definitely out of place , since russians came to this land only 70 years ago killing all the local population . 
  ca n't they call additional forces from nearby towns ? 
  oh , just accidentally stumbled upon one article and remembered this thread . 
  so the deal about the land is following : if a residential-building is built recently , it is owned by the company that built it , tho they can sell it along the sell of the flat . 
  if it is an old building ( f.e. 
  \u0445\u0440\u0443\u0449\u043e\u0301\u0431\u044b ) there were two possibilities . 
  if the flat owners of the building creates \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e , they became the owners of the land , tho right now it seems the new practice was implemented and every flat owner became responsible for the land , tho it created quite some confusion etc , as it is fairly new practice and still a lot of things are unclear . 
   if your apartment building was shelled and destroyed , apartment no longer exists and municipality can just build new one there without owing anything to you , because land is not yours . 
  even if law of ukraine does say that , i am fairly sure that if everything will be ok ( i mean pro-western course of the country , and if eastern regions are yet again united with the mainland ) , eu/us will help to rebuild these homes in one way or another . 
  of course we will have to assume that the government wo n't build homes for themselves using that money instead of helping \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u043c . 
  i know , a lot of * ifs * , tho i believe everything will be ok . btw , about the rent . 
  as i said any kind of informal agreement is legit ( even the verbal one ) , tho there are some advantages of notarizing it . 
  1 . identity check of the owner ( tho some kind of fraud happens very rarely i believe ) 2 . notarized agreement has the legal power over the informal one . 
  meaning , you make a deal to rent a flat for 12 months . 
  5 months after owner decides to sell the place , finds the buyer and without telling you sells the place . 
  if the agreement is notarized you will be able to live here till your contract runs using exact same deal money-wise and stuff with the new owner , and he wo n't be able to throw you out . 
  obviously if there was a clause in the agreement that the owner can sell the place there 's nothing you can do even if you notarize it . 
  and obviously if you break the agreement you can be thrown out . 
  alternatively , if the agreement was n't notarized , it is still binding , however , the new owner will be able to throw you out instantly ( as his agreement is notarized and yours not ) , tho you will be able to get some kind of compensation of the previous owner , even if it 's not in the agreement . 
  also , if you want to register at your place of living ( f.e. 
  you want to get the ability to let your children to the kindergarten in the area and similar stuff like that ) , you can do it online . 
  literally every other week here on / r/europe thread like this is created . 
  you sure ? 
  i 'm afraid in russia there is very high percentage of people who would cheer even to that kind of rhetoric . 
   norway is even part of the shengen area . 
  so is iceland, 
  sure , and probably every one of them has the different calculations which support that claim . 
  tho our is a tourist attraction called [ park of europe ] ( http://www.europosparkas.lt/ ) and golf fields ant stuff around it , soo . . our wins !, 
  not sure what you mean by that . 
  sure , either [ this ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/07/23/world/europe/23reuters-ukraine-crisis-commander-exclusive.html?ref=world&amp;_r=1 ) it 's just whenever i see westerner pro-putin shill i assume they know russian language since it is essential to understand what is going on to defend it . 
  if you are defending that nest of hornets without reading russian then ... well , it would explain quite a lot , tho it 's not understandable why one would put himself in such a position . 
  you better change your rhetoric , since churkin said [ that ] ( http://www.newsru.com/world/23jul2014/vostokreuters.html#1 ) ... sorry to crush your dreams :(, 
  it 's just a part of [ history ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t31.0-8/10496245_10152588626254233_6127838130934131853_o.jpg ), 
  dafaq is his problem ? 
  is he against jewish cats or against jewish people too ? 
  as a troll you gon na deny any source , i guess you would be able to deny even directly filmed video of rebels shooting from the buk . 
  here you go tho , http://foto.terpe.lt/inkelti/20140717/i36_z16342152aa.jpg edit : original [ source ] ( http://www.novoross.info/politiks/27437-u-doneckih-opolchencev-poyavilis-zenitno-raketnye-kompleksy-buk.html ), 
  ability to use brain, 
  cause if you put an arm in the air it 's nazi salute . 
  you must be trolling . 
  even russians admit the rebels had that ability . 
  you might play neutral ? 
  like that another one s country . . sweetsomething . . 
  i wish this was true , tho no facts so far support that theory . 
  well there were some reports about young kaliningradians calling themselves koningsburg and stuff , and some taxi driver talking `` why did n't russians sell that german land to germans when germans wanted it , why ?? 
  '' , but that 's about it . 
  oh , and very strange message from the local government 's office saying that ukrainians from maidan are coming to kaliningrad to create another maidan . 
  that could maybe indicate that local government does n't feel very strong . 
  however , kalningrad is heavily militarized and there are a lot of officers , soldiers , spies and stuff , and not a lot of local population which by itself is russian descendants of wwii soldiers and workers and alike . 
  so ca n't really see real wind of change there . 
  that law is probably more directed at the kaukazian/mulsim/eastern regions . 
  edit : oh , and obviously crimean . 
  yeah , sorry , i just lose the temper when i see someone straight-up lying . 
  one can have different point of view or whatever , but when one blatantly lies ... that 's just ... 
  yeah , you are best friend . 
  now you completely turn around everything you said and meant at the time you said it without admitting any wrongdoing or wrongwordphrasing . 
  so you perfectly well understand what you wrote and you still wrote it and you are still denying it . 
  you are best friend . 
  let 's see what you have done - you linked the misleading title to the polish newssite in polish language implying ( by the wording you made ) that lithuania now banned the bilingual street signs , when in fact they were illegal since forever . 
  ask any person what they thought about what your title meant and everyone will answer the same - that lithuania now made them illegal , even the other polish guy in the thread thought it himself . 
  then you accused me of not knowing my country 's law and then lied about the bilingual sings being neither legal neither illegal , when in fact they are illegal , and you know it .
