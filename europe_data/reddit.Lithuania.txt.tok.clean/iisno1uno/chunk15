  it is located south of turkey , west of syria and lebanon , northwest of israel , north of egypt and east of greece . 
  well everything what is described in the wikipedia article is already used by the standard taxi companies in lithuania , except ridesharing , that 's why i do not understand what 's so different about them . 
  you are the youngest brother . 
  you have to take some teasing . 
  i 'll just leave [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulay2fvued8 ) here . 
  standing . 
  can you explain what 's the main difference between them and other taxi companies ? 
  is it ridesharing ? 
  it 's very hard to tell what 's hoc exactly about . 
  it 's more about human nature than other things , tho it takes place in the scenery of politics , lobbyism and backstage deals . 
  if you are on / r/europe than i definitely recommend you to check it out   the politicians can always be bought . 
  i guess that 's what i object the most . 
  do you want to say there are no `` clean '' politicians out there , who are ideologically driven ? 
  be it interests of the party , of the state or ( in the case of russia/putin ) of the idea of imperialism . 
  in other words , no one can * buy * putin , since he already owns the damn country .

  have you watched house of cards ? 
   more often than not people are driven by the seek of power . 
  some think it comes from money , ergo becomes businessmen with money . 
  others think it lies in politics . 
  so money is n't necessarily a force that has the influence , contrary , oligarchs become hostage of their own money and the politicians who 's decision may influence the upcoming deals etc. 
  germany needs to be spied upon because every single pm proves it can not be [ trusted ] ( http://www.ekspertai.eu/static/uploads/cache/800x600/2014-07-18/putin-merkel.png ) . 
  lithuanians do not use that word as a curse word . 
  however russians do . 
  tho probably it has more to do [ this ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041f\u043e\u0437\u0430_\u043d\u0430_\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0445 ) and not the illness itself . 
  while one could definitely think that 's the case , actually not even 24hrs has passed after the crash and sergey lavrov already was blaming ukraine for not controlling their airspace and threatening to invade it because of that and because , as russia say , ukrainian army is attacking russia 's border guard stations and nearby villages . 
  there will be some idiots standing even behinds this kind of nonsense , tho it 's not the main reason theories like this exist . 
  purpose of their creation is to plant a seed of doubt in the heads of general population , so they would confuse themselves and think like `` well , it might have been that , but this one claims it 's the other thing ... or maybe it 's that ... we ca n't know for sure '' . 
  [ sweet ] ( http://www.ekspertai.eu/static/uploads/cache/800x600/2014-07-18/putin-merkel.png ), 
  every eu flag should be at half-mast, 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  what knife in a back ? 
  no fucking law was changed , this fucking title is a total fucking lie . 
  thanks for your kind comments . 
  you are acting truly like an ally . 
  alright thanks for the input !, 
  we 'll think about it . 
  ^ ^ ^ not, 
  you want this law abolished because poles of lithuania ( 6 % of the population ) do not follow it ? 
  what about if polish minority leaders show the example on how to follow it and raise the flags themselves ? 
  cause in every other part of lithuania this law is followed thoroughly and almost everyone flies the flags on national holidays proudly . 
  w00t ? 
  well it 's some kind of education . 
  the fine for breaking this law is like 3 euros and i have never heard of someone getting that fine . 
  on the contrary , police on days like this try to educate the public and instead of fining they are [ gifting ] ( http://tv.lrytas.lt/?id=14046494191402350375 ) the flags and educating about the holiday etc. 
  it seems it just had a snowball effect thanks to / u/ama _ deo cause he 's the one who created this reddit headline and repeated that lie few times itt, 
  we have laws we have . 
  it 's required to raise the lithuanian flag on 3 occasions the year . 
  if you do n't like the law you can try to change it ( it was never attempted by no on ) either leave the country . 
  not following the law is not the solution , would you agree ? 
  also , there 's no law against putting polish flag on poland 's holiday . 
  the thing is polish minority in lithuania is lithuania 's internal affair and when poland as a country trying to dictate what we have to do with our own citizens it seems just as imperialistic as policy of russia . 
  yes , it seems that 's exactly what happened . 
  now knowing that fact , do you still think your media did not lie ? 
  at least the headline here on reddit is just absurd . 
  additionally , as i said , polish minority party voted for that proposal in the end because they know they can easily add whatever they like later on while debating about the law in the committees etc. 
  can you please translate the article or at least this part of the article properly ? 
  cause google translate kinda sucks . 
  anyways , from what i searched myself there was proposal yesterday in seimas ** by the polish minority party ** . 
  there 's results on voting about it . 
  http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter/w5_sale.bals?p_bals_id=-18705&amp;p_var=2 `` u\u017e '' translates to `` for '' , and * llraf * is * frakcija akciji wyborzcy poliakow na litwe * ( i tried to write that part myself without any help  this vote was not however a vote on the law itself , it was first of many votings which means `` do we agree to accept this proposal and work on it in committees and stuff '' . 
  the proposal [ text ] ( http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=462919 ) says :  4 straipsnis . 
  this actually proposes to allow the bilingual signs and to use the polish language in municipalities . 
  so ... once again . 
  polish media sometimes uses the same methods as russian media does . 
  the thing is these acquisitions are just not true . 
  our parliament did not pass any law regarding this . 
  you should stop believing your media 's propaganda . 
  in some cases it is as blatant as the russian one . 
  can you properly translate this part ? 
  perception would change if polish minority leaders would n't be so pro-russian . 
  playing a bit friendlier to the lithuania as a country would help too . 
  polish minority top politicians do not raise a lithuanian flag as is required by law on national lithuanian holidays and then do raise the polish flag on poland 's national holiday . 
  dafaq are you talking about ? 
  they were illegal always . 
  he have a law saying that all the public writings should be in lithuanian only and this law was in force for over 20 years . 
  you can always visit netherlands embassy to lay flowers and candles . 
  they do . 
  most russians sadly are very poorly educated , do not know foreign languages , and it 's the only info source they get . 
  and russians know how to manipulate media . 
  they have done it for almost a century during soviet times and really mastered it . 
  the ones who are educated enough to hear the different opinions , more often than not are defending the regime because of national pride and patriotic feelings . 
   russia will not invade a single nato or eu country . 
  we do n't know that . 
  we can assume that because we think that article no 5 would do it 's job in case of aggression . 
  but first of all , we have to believe it 100 % . 
  do we tho ? 
  i do not trust most european countries seeing how their politicians are acting now to defend baltics . 
  and even if we believe article no 5 would work , we have to convince russia western countries would not leave baltics alone . 
  so far putin is testing boundaries . 
  every day . 
  he is sending planes to test the baltic air police mission ( sounds of jets over vilnius has become a norm these days ) , he is conducting military exercises in kaliningrad and belarus where they are pretending to cut off corridor poland-lithuania while attacking baltics from every possible direction , he is sending his navy to our exclusive economic zone and disregarding our border guards , he is checking waters amongst russian minority communities in the baltics trying to find out whether they agree on crimean scenario ( thankfully our state department says with no luck so far ) . 
  not to mention what he is doing in georgia/ukraine/moldava and going unpunished , he just sees weak europe , he sees a lot of politicians and popular opinion shifting against us ( while he has good relationship with radical right as well green/left parties in europe ) . 
  so , does he believe that he ca n't touch nato/eu ? 
  i doubt that very much . 
   there 's no plausible victory or anything to make it worth it . 
  i am sorry to racially profile , but as an american you just do n't understand the mentality of russian people . 
  they feel patriotic towards their country not because they love the house where they grew up , not because they love the smell of bread they make , not because of their ( amazing ) poets and writers , but because of the imperialistic idea that is planted in their head throughout the generations . 
  it 's one of the corner stones of the russian culture . 
  there are 100 direct confirmed links to the rebels and the shooting itself .
