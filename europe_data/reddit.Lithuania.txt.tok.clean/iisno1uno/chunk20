  import taxes for used cars are astronomically high . 
  since the domestic league is shit , and only a very few clubs have traditions and whatnot , i would say most of the football fans have their favourite teams either from uk , spain , or germany . 
  truly , most people follow those clubs with more passion and attention than the local ones , if at all . 
   as go to primary sources of information instead . 
  like rt.com . 
  thank you putin for saving russians from those pr companies in wikipedia . 
  yeah , me too . 
  you can notice me with my family at 1:44 , i 'm that little dude with a hat . 
  it 's like straight from some stereotypical movie . 
  like in guantanamo ? 
   ( i really , really have no fucking clue as to what he was going on about here ) . 
  as i understand eu some time ago passed the law that visitors from 3rd countries have to be fingerprinted before getting a schengen visa . 
  he does not like that , and asks how come spanish can sell their products there , if they are asking us ( russians ) for fingerprints when visiting spain . 
  so you 're saying it is not more tolerated in greece than in turkey ? 
  those lands are worth millions , there are projects that would build more skyscrapers there . 
  however , owners of those slums do n't want to sell for a few millions , they want more millions . 
  it 's been an issue since vilnius ' new city center began to develop , so about 15 years now . 
  few lawsuits , few initiatives on legislative level to force them to sell , etc. 
  so basically owners can not upgrade their houses because they do n't know what awaits them , and no other development can be started here . 
  i guess that state of limbo will take a decade more at least . 
   are you stupid or something ? 
  first let me congratulate you at wonderful beginning of your post . 
  did you think of it by yourself ? 
   my parents were both born in sfr yugoslavia , yet their birth certificates say that they 're born in wherever , bosnia and herzegovina . 
  do you know what is the difference between birth certificate and valid passport ? 
  well , maybe when you reach your 16th birth day , you 'll find out . 
   does your ( or your parents ' ) passport say that they were born in ussr ? 
  i was born in soviet times , it does not mention ussr anywhere . 
  also , do you know the difference between ussr and russia ? 
   latvians ares thes ones whos sticks ans s ats thes ends ofs theirs words . 
  we do it too . 
  we just add ` a ' or ` i ' before the 's 's as well . 
  are you sure you 're not thinking of some events in westeros ? 
  you mean annexing neighbouring country 's territory and then calling it ` ours ' ? 
  in the village in auk\u0161taitija where i spent my childhood summers they are saying `` a\u0161in '' . 
  are you still talking about media ? 
  what has us ' foreign policy to do with it ? 
  do n't you remember the shitstorm in media before during and after iraq war ? 
  different shades of gray lol ? 
  no anti-establishment ? 
  so you mean you want communist mainstream media channel to be able to say there 's free media or something ? 
  well russia did implement food trade sanctions . 
  do n't know about what parallel worlds you 're talking . 
  you should read up a bit more maybe . 
  eu sanctions did not forbid any kind of food trade . 
  no way of knowing what is one 's home is one of the reasons , but pretty much a deciding in many cases . 
  they did n't , coaches did though . 
  the players stood there straight looking to the flag with their hands on their hearts . 
  who was convinced they 'll vote yes ? 
  everywhere i read everyone was talking about the negative outcome . 
  bit outdated . 
   as for her qualities as a politician , she 's very bad i voted for her both times ( and i 'm sure it was the right decision back then and now ) and i do agree with you . 
  i mean , she knows how to be popular in the masses , and she does some things right , but overall she 's not a diplomatic person and her ruling style is quite autocratic . 
  she could be a good technocrat , but that 's not what being one of the eu leaders is about . 
  wait , so the court in hague is deciding on that matter for 13 years already ? 
  i remember it like it happened yesterday . 
  so many fought bravely . 
  many friends of mine lost their lives . 
  1815 , never forget , never forgive . 
  and what is the percentage of lutherans commiting terrorist attacks , and what is the % of muslims who do that ? 
  something tells me you 're from gdansk , 
  yeah , baltijos is probably the only \u0160vyturys beer worth buying . 
  do you get them imported in poland ? 
  yeah , now that i think of it , i have n't seen `` negras '' anywhere in the media in a while . 
  few years at least . 
  however , there are people using this term still with no derogatory connotations whatsoever . 
  `` baltijos '' is the brand name , it means `` baltic sea/region beer '' . 
  the name `` baltic '' though comes from lithuanian/latvian word `` balt ( a ) s '' , meaning `` white ' . 
   even the `` negras '' used to be / ( still is ? ), 
  not meant as an insult that 's what funny about words , they itself do n't mean shit , it 's what the person saying them means matters . 
  as for `` negras '' , yep , it is still may be considered pc term , and you can find that word in media and such , but since it has close proximity to the infamous english word , and since i know some people use `` negras '' as at least slightly derogatory term , i myself try to use `` juodaodis '' . 
   do n't take offense if you hear yourself being called a `` negras '' [ neh-ghras ] . 
  it reminds me louis ck ( ? ), 
  joke about the word `` jew '' , which can be used as derogatory term as well as normal word depending on how the person says it . 
  `` v\u0117lionis '' does n't mean `` death '' exactly , it 's more like `` the deceased one '' , `` the dead one '' . 
  `` death '' is `` mirtis '' . 
   velis = ghost v\u0117l\u0117 in lithuanian . 
  yeah , no doubt these words have the same baltic root . 
  ninja edit : look at russian , `` chyort '' is `` devil '' , `` chyorny '' is `` black '' . 
  there might be associations with the colour itself , but no , no such meaning . 
  devil is `` velnias '' , '' \u0161\u0117tonas '' . 
  latvian for `` black '' is `` melns '' , while in lithuanian `` m\u0117lynas '' means `` blue '' . 
   lithuanian term from black people '' juodaodis '' does n't translate nicely into english now everybody will think it 's some slur or something  it just means `` black skin '' , which does n't sound well in english , but actually is perfectly fine and politically-correct term in lithuanian . 
  white people are called `` baltaodis '' , which translates to `` white skin '' .
