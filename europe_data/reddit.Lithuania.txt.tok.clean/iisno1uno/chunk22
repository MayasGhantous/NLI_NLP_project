  shots fired . 
  i 'm not really sure how 's that index made . 
  lithuania does n't have any tragic incidents since 1975 when 20 people ( mostly passengers ) died . 
  yes , from time to time some incident happens when some jerk tries to cross the crossing when the red signal is on and gets hit by the train , but other than that not a single train crash or anything like that . 
  so to get 0.00 for safety ? 
  i just do n't get it . 
  judging by the time you spend on reddit , you are the one in need of diet . 
  proper diet . 
  like cut those kfc buckets out , eat more salad etc. 
  i 'm not racist , but why are you the way you are ? 
  why i 'm not surprised you ca n't even understand what 's being discussed there . 
  why are you asking if you answer it yourself ? 
  what if their culture is sacrificing babies to the gods , enslaving neighbours , and their songs are solely made of screams . 
  am i racist then too ? 
   `` i do n't hate gypsies just their culture '' are you saying it 's racist to hate some culture ? 
  you might want to declare your 1/32th irishness too . 
  can you tell more about that ? 
  generally interested . 
  actually only one of them is a tank . 
  go opera brother , no need for no plugins and addons , everything 's already there . 
  yeah no . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  it 's amazing to be as old fart as you are and still not be able to understand why posting more than week old news is stupid as fuck . 
   25/04 04:39 cet it was posted like 26 times on this subreddit , what the hell is wrong with you ? 
  nah , she 's not worthy of yuropean enlightment yet . 
  about what events and popes are you talking ? 
  there was n't significant drop since erm2 , but yeah , they dropped a little .

  had a sneaky suspicion it may not be all stalin portraits and hammers and sickles . 
  also [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otqcmeth0be ) . 
  you asked really interesting question , bit sad that no one answered it in-depth . 
  basically since many football clubs are old as hell , most existing rivalries have either social , either ethnic , political , religious foundation , in addition to territorial ( district ) rivalry . 
  see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madrid_derby#background_and_history http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fenerbah\u00e7e\u2013galatasaray_rivalry#culture http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarajevo_derby#history however , recently most of these differences do not play the main role . 
  mostly , as others said , all it comes down to is for which team someone 's parents are rooting . 
  when you are exposed to the particular team since your childhood , that is going to the stadium , team 's colours , players , atmosphere , it 's not really a choice , it just comes naturally . 
  you do not use lowercase letters for the name of this subreddit . 
  what are you , american flagmaker from half a year ago ? 
  so your suggestion is to cheat and scam ? 
  need some proof of dem legs . 
  where are my racial insults ? 
  if you 'd look around though , no ukrainians commented here , nobody mentioned them , only you started talking about `` ukrops '' out of the blue . 
  just shows how narrow-minded hateful mind of such a vatniks as yourself works . 
  so basically i ca n't call someone racist scum if he 's racist scum ? 
  vatnik is not directed at any nationality nor is it racial slur of any kind . 
  it just describes one 's state of mind . 
  or lack of mind . 
  what bullshit ? 
  what exact bullshit of mine ? 
  i was banned for `` trolling '' , not for racial insults , slurs or your imaginary `` russophobia '' . 
  you are the one coming here and start throwing insults around out of nowhere . 
  never said anything against russians in that subreddit or any other . 
  called few morons by what they really are - vatniks , got banned . 
  but i find it funny that you fit yet another vatnik stereotype , when caught doing something - `` but whatabout ... '' . 
  never change please . 
  that 's why you can throw racial insults around for no reason whatsoever ? 
  no , seriously , it 's not the subreddit for the likes of you . 
  plot twist : boss is in germany . 
   the president wo n't be there because he 's scared , og\u00f3rek says that she will only come if the president will be there . 
  sld knows he wo n't be there , and they know that og\u00f3rek has no chance in any debate so they just pretend it is komorowski 's fault that she wo n't come . 
  i just had dejavu . 
  read the same thing a week or so ago on a thread about uk elections . 
  same here in lithuania . 
  71 mp elected from respective constituency , 70 mps proportionally nation-wide from the parties ' lists . 
  there are calls to lower the mp count and leave only constituency system . 
  such a retarded thing to do . 
  somebody 's jelly . 
  actually by the very definition of the term it 's slavery . 
  you can not leave , you can not own shit , you can not not work . 
  obviously it 's very different kind of slavery , not comparable to ancient times or what was happening in us not that long ago - it was n't that brutal ( when stalin died at least ) , but yeah , it 's way closer to slavery proper than anything else . 
  have you seen [ grozny ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/grozny-city_towers_facade_clocks.jpg ) ? 
  so many fancy lights !, 
  truest first world city , capital of business and prosperity . 
  as to su not being 3rd world country ... well duh . 
  the term `` 2nd world '' was invented specifically for su and its satellites . 
   there were actually places in the world where it was way way worse at the time . 
  got it . 
  thanks for opening my eyes , it changes everything . 
   there is no way in which a language can be older than others . 
  w0ot ? 
  as to latvian/lithuanian , yeah , no significant difference there . 
  yeah , and those saying `` ussr was n't that bad '' often forget there was period of time when one dictator sent to die millions of innocent people . 
  stalin . 
  the title should read `` police crack unfit for consumption meat trafficking ring '' . 
  only some of them got their visas revoked . 
  there should still be those who cross the border . 
  on the contrary . 
  what does it make you ? 
  it 's about organization and popularization . 
  before that spring cleanings in local communities were done on separate dates and dependent on initiative of one or two local activists . 
  today it 's nation-wide highly orchastrated event where all the top politicians want to participate because of media attention . 
  what exactly do n't you get there ? 
  spring cleaning in local communities ? 
  yes . 
  nation-wide darom ? 
  very recently . 
   living not exactly the word you 're looking for i guess . 
  you 're tearing me apart , belgium . 
  yeah , that one is the best . 
  though the other one with half-opened matrioshka reminded me [ this ad ] ( https://youtu.be/x2wmndj-mh4 ) . 
   without saying anything to local authorities .
