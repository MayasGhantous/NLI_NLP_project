  nowadays , however , schools white-wash lenin 's and stalin 's crimes , as commanded by comrade putin , and fast-forward 10 years into the future , no one will even talk about `` negative aspects '' of lenin and stalin regime . 
  be smarter than that , just ignore him . 
  europe is a god ? 
  i do not frequent that subreddit , so was not really sure what to expect , when i decided to see what our russian friends think out loud . 
  safe to say i was not disappointed . 
   up until the mid-1980 's economic growth in the ussr was close to the us , the standard of living was very comparable to europe , about half of what it was in america . 
  the recessions started around 1985 . 
   the economic recession of the late 1980 's , combined with greater freedom of speech , allowed the us propaganda machine to move in and rapidly brainwash the population there sources [ here ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/2jknl7/blame_game_nato_expanded_to_russia_or_russia/clcxiua ) and [ here ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/2jknl7/blame_game_nato_expanded_to_russia_or_russia/clcuppj ) . 
  got it ? 
  us propaganda brainwashed ussr citizens during 80s . 
   china with central governing , does fine in economy department well ... not really actually . 
  they are improving , yes , but they are still way behind europe , and poland for that matter , when we talk about the average citizen . 
  nope . 
  you said vilnius was build by poles , i said that it was multinational city , then you provide stats for 20 years period out of 600 + years history of the city and claim it 's polish city because at that time poles had 50 % + majority . 
  it 's indeed pointless discussion . 
  and to bring armenian genocide here and to call me acting like turk ... it 's like you do n't even understand what 's happening around you . 
  do you tie your shoelaces yourself at least ? 
  lol . 
  you took one small period in the history of city older than 500 years . 
  are you trolling or something ? 
  i know nothing about lwow , it could have been built by egyptians for all i care, 
  what exactly do you want to say with that quote ? 
  was the city build during 1920-39 or something ? 
  but it was n't . 
  and when you say that what do you mean exactly ? 
  that everyone was polish or that only poles worked ? 
  or that since polish was popular language it means it 's a polish city . 
  what about today 's vilnius , maybe it 's english since so many can speak english around here . 
  that 's the problem with the understanding everyone has ( poles and lithuanians all the like ) - we think that vilnius was someone 's city , when in fact it was multinational multicultural all the times . 
  there lived lithuanians poles jews belarussians , later on russians . 
  it was never polish or lithuanian city only . 
  vilnius was build by polish speaking people ? 
  til, 
  romania can into schengen . 
  it 's done by the guy called tadas vidmantas . 
  some of his other videos : [ suicide machine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf0ui_tboac ) , [ minusiq ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9pd_uk6vgu ) , [ mineral water commercial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nitlob098w8 ) , other stuff at his site http://tadasvidmantas.com/ . 
  edit : oh , and http://www.sleepthinker.com/, 
  you might like to see movie [ redirected ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inkmg9cckqw ) then , full of eastern european stereotypes . 
  i know they are showing it in neighboring countries right now and it will premier in uk soon . 
  not sure about romania . 
  [ eastern european men school ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uzu58n-sso ), 
  nope . 
   lithuania claiming it in 1918 as their capital based on old gdl claim was as if france has claimed aachen for their new capital basing it on the fact that it was charlemagne 's capital and ignoring that population there is german . 
  not true . 
  educate yourself polish imperialist : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_seimas_of_vilnius http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_poland  the lithuanian government argued that the majority of those who declared polish nationality were in fact polonized lithuanians , that the area historically belonged to lithuania propria part of the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth and believed that their historical claim to the city of vilnius ( which at that point was divided near evenly between poles and jews , with lithuanian speaking as constituting a mere fraction -- about 2 -- 3 % -- of the total population ) had precedence over self-determination rights of the mostly polish speaking population of the region . 
  the negotiations and international mediation led to nowhere and until 1920 the disputed territory remained divided into a lithuanian and a polish part . 
   finally , in 1920 , after a staged coup on october 9 , polish general lucjan \u017beligowski seized the lithuanian part of the disputed territory and created there a semi-independent republic of central lithuania . 
  although the following year it voted to join poland . 
  sounds familiar does n't it ? 
  and i really like the one-sidedness of yours when you use term `` 1939 occupation '' and completely forget the 1920 occupation . 
  wll it does n't even have to rhyme to make sense, 
   i 'm from the uk and fly to ireland regularly , you do n't need a passport technically but most airlines enforce it anyway . 
  hello , schengen calling . 
  we know the deal . 
  i kinda understand this . 
  i was trying to find out what he meant by `` coins '' , and when the price stops being `` coins '' . 
  cause he said himself , that if something costs $ 500 , it 's * euro * , not * euros * . 
  [ superdalia ] ( http://www.fastimages.eu/images/asdfff.jpg ), 
   do n't you mean `` eve as male character '' ? 
  yes , edited, 
  i bet you can think of some nickname which would identify eve as male character . 
  so if it 's over $ 5 you use `` euro '' ? 
  so are we talking about german pronunciation or about the catalan one ? 
  blame irishmen ( probably ), 
   euro in german is pronounced `` oig\u00f3 '' oiro , not oigo, 
   god damm that is a overused argument !, 
   also , does it even translate into serbian ? 
  you mean is there a serbian boy 's name which rhymes with serbian version of eve ? 
  i would be very surprised if you could find a language that this phrase can not be translated to . 
  it does n't have to be putin all the time when you see someone with a russian flair . 
  there are a lot of restrictions about things like that crossing the border , i reckon inside eu too . 
  i know that individual and read his delusional thoughts before . 
  just browse through his comment history . 
  dunno if you understand russian but i found it very funny - http://bazurka.net/other/news/3438-konflikt-rossii-i-ukrainy-v-feysbuke.html one of the parts i really liked goes like : july 25th , usa creates group * sanctions against russia * july 25th , europe , australia , canada , japan joins group * sanctions against russia * july 26th , russia : you w0t ?? 
  july 27th , russia joins group * sanctions against russia *, 
  it does n't change the fact that you are putinbot . 
  indeed . 
  tho elections in early 90s were the turning point . 
  estonians elected young liberals without shady past who brought progress rather quickly . 
  we , on the other hand , were ( are ) holding on to the past , same people , same mindset , and even the right wing we have ( conservatives ) are not much pro-progress compared to estonian liberals . 
  they did not reelect ( ex ) communists in early 90s as we and latvians for some reason managed to . 
   you need some luck getting anything better than minimal - 289 til that all of my friends/social circle are lucky sons of bitches . 
  i literally do not know anyone working for minimum wage . 
  also thing to remember that even when someone is getting paid minimum wage on paper more often than not his actual salary is higher because of not reported income and stuff . 
  reports say that actual average/median wage in lithuania is at least 30 % higher . 
  my browser prompted some warning stating that they ca n't verify certificate or something , and suggesting me to leave as you might trying to trick me . 
  but i continued anyways !, 
  just because it 's . eu you know . 
   . gov , . edu . 
  . mil are us exclusive top level domains . 
  . edu is not exclusive . 
  now that i think of it i probably do not see * f.e. 
  * much in use anywhere . 
  it 's probably some shit i picked up in school where they taught `` proper '' british english . 
   is there an american equivalent to . eu ? 
  . us i guess . 
  the difference being . us tld is assigned to usa , while . eu tld is assigned to all eu/eea member states . 
   i might answer my own question by saying i see . gov a lot but is . gov american only or can other countries governments have . gov websites ? 
  it 's only for americans . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.gov#international_equivalents before the creation of . eu domain i know european institutions used . int tld , which stands for `` international '' .
