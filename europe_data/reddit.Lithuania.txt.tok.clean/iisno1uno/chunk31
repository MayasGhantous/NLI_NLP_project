  well wales too , and yet they vote differently . 
  but this time allowing the referendum is a sure thing that scotland secedes . 
  last time it was a gamble at least . 
  why is scotland so pro-eu tho ? 
  paywall . 
  you mean you have to change the constitution to have a referendum about being part of the eu ? 
  well technically uk 's referendum ai n't binding as well . 
   what 's going to happen to uk citizens living legally in europe ? 
  i do n't think anyone will be just expelled . 
  if they living in europe for some time before the uk leaves , they will get some special status and stay , and after 5 years or so they 'll have to extend that special status . 
  newcomers obviously will have to apply for visas and stuff just like americans or canadians do . 
   what 's going to happen to europeans living legally in the uk ? 
  depends on how nationalistic the government is . 
  might as well be that everyone will have to apply for visas some time soon . 
   what 's going to happen with scotland and northern ireland ? 
  i do n't see scotland and gibraltar staying . 
  as for ni , as i understand , the situation is a bit trickier , more thorough breakdown of how the different regions voted should be done . 
  reunification is not out of the question for sure . 
   what 's going to happen with europe in general ? 
  depends if italy , sweden , denmark , netherlands hold referendums . 
  might be an end to eu as we know it , might in fact be just a push for a closer union seeing as uk will struggle . 
  wealthy 60mln people market to sell goods customs-free . 
  norwegians and swiss do n't have to apply for no visas , they are treated as eu citizens . 
  i like how you phrased the question implying there are 2 parties only . 
  that 's the only positive i see in this . 
  i saw those sinking ship metaphors many times , it 's mindblowing how many people use it and believe . 
  globalized economy does n't work like that . 
  whether uk is in or out failed eu states means huge troubles for uk , being out does n't help a single bit . 
  and britain will stand strong in the sea of failed eu states because ... ? 
  have n't they already voted ? 
  ok i 'm sorry , wo n't happen again . 
  i have a question tho . 
  is judge novikov anti-russian as well ? 
   i 've mentioned countless times i do not at all think positive of many of the actions of putin and his government . 
  not worth speaking to someone who just calls anyone a shill . 
  though , paranoia is a popular option i hear . 
  i will not go through your comment history to see if you have critiqued putin once or twice . 
  i see what you talk now , so it 's either being shill , or some other insults aimed at your mental abilities . 
   i never mentioned russophobia . 
  having an agenda against russia is n't automatically russophobia . 
  pardon for not being up-to-date with shill terminology . 
  tho i suspect it depends on what agenda needs to be pushed and how to manoeuvre in a discussion at the moment . 
   they have a vested interest against russia , this is why they are so obsessed with trying to put russia in a negative , sometimes unrealistically negative , light . 
  they have vested interest against russia 's current government , not russia itself . 
  unless you 're saying that they are traitors and working for cia or whatever . 
  are you saying that ? 
   meduza is russian . 
    that means nothing to me . 
  that 's no surprise at all . 
  facts do n't mean shit to shills like you . 
   they obviously have an anti-russian agenda since they resigned from their jobs in russia because they did n't like the way it was going . 
  just shows how backward and idiotic this logic is , and how ridiculous are those cries of `` rusophobia '' . 
  of course they do not like where russia is headed , they feel that it 's a wrong path , and they think this path is only harming russia and its people , and because they think for russia to be successful country needs to change the ways it 's doing business you call them rusophobic . . would be funny if it were n't so sad , since it 's highly wide-spread mindset in russia at the moment . 
   meduza has a very obvious anti-russian agenda meduza is russian . 
  or do you mean that when russians disagree with the government they are anti-russian ? 
  yes that 's what happened . 
  afterwards an old man showed up and gave cameron a $ # $ 100 % bill . 
  that man 's name ? 
  albert leavenstein . 
  yes . 
  the second part of your post obviously not , but for the first one i guarantee that almost everyone thought you 're serious . 
  https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=c\u017ev+kal\u0117jimas+lietuvoje hundreds if not thousands different articles in all the main news sites . 
  maybe your memory ai n't so good , or you do n't read the press , and then complain `` why do they hide the information , it 's a conspiracy !, 
  i heard they spread the gay disease to lower the population count . 
  oh shit , they have not repeated their lie in the last week . 
  this means they have not been lying on december 22nd either !, 
  good to know . 
  is it so hard to put a few words into google ? 
  i think it was an accident , and i think the chronology was the following : at first it was : `` oh shit , the anti-kremlin sites are blowing up , we left the footage of a cluster bomb here '' . 
  so they make a bs excuse how `` a pilot could have been identified '' and take the video down , and reupload it without that `` pilot '' and `` coincidentally '' it also is missing the part where the cluster bomb is seen . 
  then the internet catches on on that as well , the rt guys talk to higher ups , higher ups decide - `` yeah fuck it , we do n't care , show them what we got '' , so they delete the video again , and upload the original one more time , this time saying `` nah , it 's ok , the pilot does n't mind , look as much as you want '' . 
  the reasons for propaganda machine bosses allowing to upload the video with cluster bomb seen ? 
  i dunno , there could all the ones you listed and more , or a little bit from column a , little bit from column b. 
  it 's reddit , all that is read is the title + top comment if the title was interesting enough . 
  i 'm not editing , fck it . 
  [ those sweat tears . 
  ] ( http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/components/photo/_new/120305-putin-tears-1a.jpg ), 
   they say that they were checking the footage for personal identity reasons did you want them to say `` we showed we 're using cluster bombs which we are saying we are not using , so we removed that part '' . 
  yes , now they deleted and reuploaded the video 2nd time with cluster bombs visible again , after it all blew on the internet . 
  probably now their trolls are being instructed to push an agenda like `` they were not using cluster bombs on december 2015 '' , `` cluster bombs are not illegal '' , etc. 
  there were accusations and proofs that they were using it on december 2015 as well , but obviously it was `` not enough proof '' for a regular putin-defender . 
  what 's funny now is that they showed they are using these bombs themselves , and then straight after that they are trying to cover it . 
  and do you think when asked by journalists anyone from the government will admit they 're using cluster bombs now ? 
  gim me a break . 
   i could n't believe that they 're asking such a price for basic pens . 
  because they 're not `` basic pens '' . 
  and yes , if they were sold in lithuania before adoption of euro they could n't have costed $ 0.30-0 .90 . 
  there 's a current price for a `` basic pen '' https://www.prisma.lt/entry/melynos-spalvos-tusinukas---m---g-b-2020-/6947503740481 and there 's a price for a bit better one https://www.prisma.lt/entry/gelinis-rasiklis---freewriter-/3154142261212 and do you know why the price is exactly $ 1,16 ? 
  because it has n't changed a bit since converted from litas = 1.16 * 3.4528 = 3.99 . 
  feel free to provide more examples for me to debunk this mystical `` big price jump '' . 
  i really doubt it . 
  it 's $ 4 on [ amazon.de ] ( https://www.amazon.de/schneider-schreibger\u00e4te-f\u00fcllhalter-blau-transparent-fledermaus/dp/b00p6fkv2g/ref=sr_1_4?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1466448338&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=schneider+easy ) , and you 're saying it cost two years ago in lithuania $ 0.30-0 .90 . 
  what price do you recall schneider pens costing ? 
  not illegal in russia , but russia lied about it nonetheless . 
  http://www.ruaviation.com/news/2015/12/22/4450/?h  moscow denied allegations its aerospace forces have used cluster bombs in the fight against terrorism in syria , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said monday, 
   the european commission wanted to `` force people to stop recalculating prices into korunas '' . 
  by implanting koruna-blocking chips into the brains ? 
   do you want more ? 
  i 'm good , it 's exactly the punishment i was expecting to see as an outsider , not really interested what was talked for one reasons or another in circles of croatian football people . 
   i did n't break the rule .
