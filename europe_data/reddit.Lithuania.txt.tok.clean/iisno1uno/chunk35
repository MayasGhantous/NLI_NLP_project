  i 'm aware . 
  i just like to insult people who annoy me with their absolute nonsenses . 
   some of the wrong deeds done by soviet union are accounted on idea of atheism . 
  again , there 's no ` idea ' of atheism . 
  it 's a simple lack of believing in one or another deity . 
  and nobody did allude that ` see what soviets did ? 
  that 's how state-atheism looks like ' . 
  maybe for a young confused man as the op is , in his mind soviet = bad , atheism = good , so in all the power he has , he had to make a comment about how they are not related or whatever he was trying to say by ` it had nothing to do with atheism ' , probably because he has not learnt yet to understand that there are more colours in the world than just black and white , and yet the fact is that many of the policies indeed came from anti-theistic/atheistic views , and the soviets , and society too , were atheist majority . 
   to equate very general terms to particular policies of countries fuck knows what you 're arguing about . 
  the op said that bolsheviks ' policies were not influenced by atheistic world view , which is a lie , and then he said that it 's not ` atheism ' what they believed , rather a ` skewed idea of atheism ' , which is moronic statement in itself . 
  now you talk about crusades and shit . 
  as a 9th grade saying goes , stop using cheap drugs . 
   their skewed idea of atheism . 
  there 's no `` idea '' of atheism . 
  soviets were atheists , just as a today 's regular swedish leftist is , because they do not believe in some deities . 
  period . 
  i believe you do n't know what atheism means . 
  so atheism . 
  lenin did not care about personal freedom . 
  nor did french revolutionaries . 
  mensheviks , on the other hand , if they were to win , we could have seen russia transforming into true social-democracy as scandinavia did . 
  it has everything to do with atheism . 
  lenin ordering to increase the numbers of executions is liberal in what way ? 
  call them what you will , if there 's no new cabinet they are the existing one . 
  the current cabinet works till mid december . 
  what . 
  the current cabinet is socialdemocrats , labour , and kinda nationalistic right wingers . 
  i have accidentally stumbled upon this [ documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx7ydgyvhbo ) . 
  however , there are only russian and [ lithuanian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz0nk1xyc8e ) versions i can find . 
  maybe someone can provide the link to english version ? 
  found it - http://vimeo.com/28013118 what amazes me most was how many parallels there are between that deadly conflict in 2008 and actions of russian rhetoric and actions nowadays . 
  blatant propaganda , straight-up lies to russian people and international community , rise of putin popularity in the russia , military provocations , looting , and the list goes on . 
  i think it 's definitely must-see for every educated european . 
  edit : added [ english ] ( http://vimeo.com/28013118 ) version . 
  can not find english article regarding this , however there 's [ russian ] ( http://www.rosbalt.ru/kaliningrad/2014/07/03/1287585.html ) and [ lithuanian ] ( http://www.lrytas.lt/lietuvos-diena/aktualijos/is-rusijos-pareiguno-lupu-kaltinimas-lietuvai.htm ) . 
  and there 's [ english one ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/kaliningrad-governor-says-west-sending-maidan-activists-into-russian-regions-to-spark-dissent/ ) . 
  basically what governor of kaliningrad and vice-pm are saying is that there are young well-built ukrainians arriving with no specific reason . 
  according to them these young men participated in euromaidan movement , so they are afraid of similar scenario happening in kaliningrad . 
  also they blame politicians in poland , lithuania and ukraine who dare to remind the world that kaliningrad was called k\u00f6nigsberg not so long ago . 
  as an example vice-pm uses quote by lithuanian president saying that karaliau\u010dius is the cradle of lithuanian literature . 
  while we can disregard statements about aggressive ukrainians coming there to create another maidan , question is , why are they saying this now ? 
  is it supposed to work as a warning for citizens of kaliningrad not to protest against current government because `` you will achieve chaos and war as in ukraine '' ? 
  or is it more about some geopolitical message ? 
  edit : added english article . 
  which team did people in your country support in the final ? 
  were they vocal about it ? 
  what was the atmosphere like in bars or public viewings ? 
  does the country of origin of the product influence your decision making ? 
  finnish vodka over russian , spanish wine over chilean . 
  what about purchases like tvs and cars ? 
  do you consider buying philips over sony , or is it just quality/price issue for you ? 
  also , is there a real reason to choose philips over sony , since they are multinational companies with major offices with a lot of people working all around the world and everything is made in china anyways ? 
  if you do not pay attention what is european and what is not , do you at least try to buy stuff made in your country/region ? 
  official stats : http://www.eurid.eu/en/about-us/facts-figures what i am more interested in is the actual use of these domains , cause obviously most of the big international companies use . eu domain as a redirect to their main . com site ( f.e. 
  also there 's cybersquatting and stuff like that . 
  how popular tho is it to use . eu as primary site and advertise it accordingly ? 
  as for use in lithuania i would say it is an alternate domain . 
  when local business aimed at local market can not find suitable name in . lt registry , they go for . eu rather than . com ( and you 'll practically never see someone using/advertising website ending with . net or any other tld ) . 
  as for businesses dealing with international customers i guess it 's 70/30 split between . com and . eu with no room left for other tlds . 
  is situation in other member states the same ? 
  i hope it wo n't be considered as a spam , i just would like to find out if entities like this use different pricing in europe/eurozone , and how much ( if ) it differs in let 's say germany/slovakia . 
  can you just click this link : http://watch.nba.com/nba/subscribe?utm_source=nbacom&amp;utm_medium=online&amp;utm_content=lpbroadband&amp;utm_campaign=nbacommain ( it 's not referral or anything ) and report back what is the price for league pass premium and league pass . 
  if it 's not in euros , approximate conversion provided would be appreciated . 
  thanks !, 
  any nba followers out here ? 
  glorious europe can into basketball !, 
  we 've been playing in the strongest bball league there is since its inaugural season ( 1946-47 ) . 
  officially first european nba player is italy-born canadian [ hank biasatti ] ( http://www.fibs.it/images/16317.jpg ) , who 's also played professional baseball in america 's top baseball league mlb ( hence the photo of him in a baseball wear ) . 
  also that season a german , and a dutch were bumping the basketball on the other side of atlantic . 
  but that 's just ancient history . 
  sizable export of our top-quality players has started about two decades ago . 
  legendary serbian vlade divac , who smoked cigarettes all his professional career ( 16 seasons in nba , top2 result among europeans ) , vs tragically killed in the car crash croatian dra\u017een petrovi\u0107 , who 's considered by many to be the best european bball player of all time - http://youtu.be/bkxqdui9ujs . 
  and who can forget 3x nba champion [ toni kuko\u010d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmlm-wxc7e ) , 3x nba all-star [ detlef schrempf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2b1zirq5ls ) , or a player who won absolutely every possible european and international championship and award there is , except for nba championship ring , [ arvydas sabonis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stqljovv-iq ) . 
  worth mentioning players who left their mark in the nba history from less-basketball oriented countries , like irish marty conlon , estonian martin m\u00fc\u00fcrsepp , czech george zidek . 
  and then came 2000s , when nba clubs because of high , slim , individual-strong and yet team-oriented players like [ predrag stojakovi\u0107 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zhc5qenppu ) , [ andrei kirilenko ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8dvi1rs5s4 ) , [ pau gasol ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjr5go5y8wk ) , and arguably the best international player in the nba [ dirk nowitzki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wvjm485yqy ) ( the only european who 's ever won mvp of the regular season ) , started drafting european and international bball players like crazy . 
  some were/are doing great , like the first ever european to be named nba finals mvp belgium-born french [ tony parker ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygvjuzolllg ) , pau 's younger brother [ marc gasol ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8ygtucwjei ) , slovenian averaging 20 + pts last season [ goran dragi\u0107 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s2yjvxbnu4 ) , or nba defensive player of the year [ joakim noah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ll6yffyey ) . 
  others ... well , not so much . 
  2nd nba draft pick of 2003 darko mili\u010di\u0107 has retired from the professional basketball in order to pursue a kickboxing career . 
  also latvian andris biedri\u0146\u0161 who , well , did not consider basketball as the first priority thing in his life either - [ nsfw ] ( http://www.puaro.lv/lv/legalize-foto-galerijas/biedrina-seksa-foto ) . 
  overall however , europeans are truly big and important part of the nba basketball . 
  today there are over 50 nba players from all over the europe ( roughly 1/7 total player pool ) , including top prospects like [ ricky rubio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnwvtycpsi ) , lithuanian [ jonas valan\u010di\u016bnas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq9lyq2sxo8 ) , greek [ giannis antetokounmpo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=movhpb9w594 ) , and nikola miroti\u0107 and his incredible [ defense ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nucvx4tfga ) . 
  ca n't forget italian ettore messina , first ever european coach to hold steering-wheel of a nba team . 
  well , at least for couple of [ games ] ( http://www.poundingtherock.com/2014/11/26/7297663/ettore-messina-will-become-first-european-to-coach-in-the-nba ) . 
  also , jewish american david blatt spent so much time in europe ( also became euroleague and eurobasket champion ) , that we can consider him truly european - is cleveland 's head-coach who has to deal with * the true and only * lebron james . 
  so , let 's circlejerk ? 
  ... or anything like that ? 
  it struck me today that though two nations share a border for quite some time , there have n't been any conflicts between them at least in the recent history . 
  or am i missing something ? 
  the famous neighbours , armenians , have fought wars , and are in extremely difficult relations with nearly all of their neighbours , turks are also not known as most peaceful nation in the world , and yet i ca n't google any solid reference for anything negative between georgians and turks . 
  why 's that ? 
  can someone provide for some material to read/watch on this issue , or answer few questions ? 
  for example , what was turkey 's stance in 2008 war ? 
  honestly ca n't remember . 
  how would you describe relations between nations during soviet times ? 
  what 's the public opinion in georgia regarding turkish-armenian war and alleged war crimes ? 
  is there any xenophobia/racism directed at each other ? 
  obviously we have religious traditions like christmas , we have legends from the greek mythology , about icarus and the sun , about prometheus and the fire , which can be already considered as european-wide folklore , but everyone knows its origins are greek . 
  so , do you know other widely-known folklore objects , which some nations may consider as their own , but in actuality it is common elsewhere also ? 
  as an example - [ baba yaga/baba roga ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baba_yaga ) . 
  every kid in slavic and ex-cccp countries knows her , and yet every slavic nation considers her as a genuine part of their culture .
