  it pains me greatly to see so many intelligent people falling for this piece of russian propaganda `` putin had n't nothing to gain from nemtsov 's murder , therefore he did n't do it , it 's just a provocation '' . 
  remember [ anna politkovskaya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anna_politkovskaya ) ? 
  [ same thing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h3wwrsn.png ) was said by putin himself after her death , same thing is being said now . 
  same thing was said by many others , after many other deaths : [ sergei magnitsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergei_magnitsky ) magnitsky had alleged there had been a large-scale theft from the russian state sanctioned and carried out by russian officials . 
  he was arrested and eventually died in prison seven days before the expiration of the one-year term during which he could be legally held without trial . 
  [ yuri shchekochikhin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuri_shchekochikhin ) he investigated russian apartment bombings allegedly directed by the russian secret services and three whales corruption scandal which involved high-ranking fsb officers and was related to money laundering through the bank of new york . 
  he died suddenly in july 2003 from a mysterious illness , just a few days before his scheduled departure to the united states where he planned to meet with fbi investigators . 
  his medical documents ended up `` classified '' by the russian authorities . 
  the symptoms of his illness fit a pattern of poisoning by radioactive materials and were similar to the symptoms of nikolai khokhlov , roman tsepov , and alexander litvinenko . 
  according to litvinenko and news reports , the death of yuri shchekochikhin was a politically motivated assassination . 
  [ paul klebnikov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_klebnikov ) his murder in moscow in 2004 was seen as a blow against investigative journalism in russia . 
  [ lev shlosberg ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-pskov-politician-attacked/26558191.html ) russian politician says he has been badly beaten after publicizing the funerals of two soldiers who may have died while fighting in ukraine . 
  and it 's just a fracture of all the political motivated assaults and murders of russian opposition journalists and politicians . 
  [ list of journalists killed since 2000s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia#under_putin_.28incl._2nd_chechen_conflict.29 ) to spew such a bs as `` it was west/cia/ukrainians / opposition false flag operation '' is mindblowing idiotism . 
  russia does n't need more sacrifices , it is as scared as it is . 
  how does this plan work in some conspiratard 's mind ? 
  kill opposition activist 2 . 
  profit is that it ? 
  literally everyone who dares to criticize putin or government in general publicly receives threats , gets criminal cases started against them , imprisoned , even killed . 
  they get called 5th columnists , traitors , even publicly [ some ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkan2zuo8c0 ) are not afraid to call to act against them `` brutally '' - `` vladimir putin , we are awaiting for your command to attack '' . 
  ksenya sobchak , the same journalist who asked putin in his pressconference the question about such labels and hostility created by him , got [ threats ] ( https://twitter.com/xenia_sobchak/status/572677415094390785 ) . 
  some other recent attacks/actions against oppositioners : http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=54f2f167c27b3 http://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/1692015.html http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/26878245.html http://smolnarod.ru/sn/smolenskogo-zhurnalista-budut-sudit-za-ekstremizm/ http://newkuzbass.ru/news/6223/advokata-stasa-kalinichenko-zaderzhali-za-popytku-prinjatj-uchastie-v-protsesse use google translator if you ca n't read russian and check the dates of these articles . 
  it 's all happening within few days . 
  it 's a non-stop circle of repressions against free mind , journalism and political opposition in the country . 
  either by thugs , `` anti-maidan '' activists , or police itself . 
  and that is my point , i wo n't start to speculate who did it , and who ordered the execution of nemtsov . 
  either it was direct order by putin himself , either putin 's words were misinterpreted by someone in his inner circle , either it was autonomous operation by fsb/army/vatniks / nationalists-patriots/someone from the government - it does n't really matter . 
  putin is responsible for everything what is happening right now in russia , he deliberately and gradually created that atmosphere . 
  and to answer some popular myths floating around in this subreddit : * putin had nothing to gain . 
  everything to gain , oppressions create fear . 
  if such an important public figure can be killed publicly in the city center , who 's to stop killing lesser-known oppositioners ? 
  also nemtsov was very vocal and insulting towards putin , it could 've been personal revenge for words he said publicly . 
  * nemtsov was unknown . 
  he was once a damn vice-pm of a damn country , and been into politics for over 2 decades . 
  literally everyone who 's over 30 knew him . 
  * he was n't a political threat to putin , he was no leader of opposition . 
  there are no political threats to putin in the country . 
  he either kills them or imprisons them . 
  and that 's why there are no real opposition , and no leaders of opposition . 
  tl ; dr - opposition is getting killed one by one ( by west/cia ) to make putin look bad , and to cement the opposition to create russian euromaidan , but glorious totally-not-zombified and not-under-the-propaganda russian nation sees through it , because numerous deaths and repressions against opposition actually helps opposition , you see .

  my question is , at whom is it aimed ? 
  internal propaganda once again ? 
  message to the baltics ? 
  just another innocent zhyrinovsky-type joke ? 
  in december 2015 it was announced that ilves ( 62 ) was engaged in mid-november to [ ieva kup\u010de ( 38 ) ] ( http://p.ocdn.ee/17/i/2016/1/5/pkloa1vz.acy.jpg ) , the head of the cybersecurity division in the defense ministry of latvia . 
  they married on 2 january 2016 . 
  [ estonian president announces wife ieva ilves is pregnant . 
  ] ( http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/baltic_news/?doc=16597 ) my question is , how could he ? 
  lithuania 's grybauskait\u0117 is still single and ready to mingle . 
  i consider this as an insult to an old , noble , and proud house . 
  beware estonians . 
  if it does include a god in the text , can parliamentarians swear without this part , and what would you say the percentage of parliamentarians who mention/do not mention is ? 
  source in lithuanian , photos , videos : http://balsas.tv3.lt/naujiena/874339/geju-eitynes-sostineje-didesniu-incidentu-nebuvo-uzfiksuota short summary of the event : it had record breaking number of participants , around 1.5-2k . 
  also record breaking number of protesters , in a sense that i do n't even know if it 's possible to get even lower numbers . 
  if during the last parade in 2013 there were at least a couple hundreds protesters , today there were a few groups of 5-10 people , in total i would say not more than 30 . 
  a lot less of police presence . 
  during the last parade the police formed a live-chain around the participants , today however no such thing , everyone was roaming free through the vilnius ' central street . 
  it 's also the first time when the municipality granted the organizers ' request for the place and date with no restrictions , while in the previous years the right to march had to be won in courts . 
  in total , media reports , 6 people held by the police , 4 before the event and 2 during , for being drunk , disturbing public order , etc. 
  otherwise loads of positive atmosphere , smiles and music . 
  most countries do have national animals , some have birds as national animals , however do you have national bird as a separate symbol ? 
  and additional question , how 's the bird law in general in your country ? 
  source in lithuanian ( and the video of the said moment ) : http://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/pasaulis/vytenis-povilas-andriukaitis-apie-nigela-farage-a-ar-sitas-glusius-is-menulio-iskrito-57-647977 v. andriukaitis biography : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vytenis_andriukaitis andriukaitis comments translated : was it laughable ? 
  yes indeed . 
  the speech was laughable , and shallow , and cheap , and demagogic . 
  it was unpleasant experience to listen to him , because his arguments were shallow and untruthful . 
  if he wanted to show his deeper understanding of euroscepticism , he had to prepare way more for his speech , now it was just low effort and distasteful . 
  it 's hurtful , when people like him are called ` politicians ' . 
  he is very far away from a politician . 
  today he said : `` you know , we will trade !, 
  we will trade and we will be good neighbours '' . 
  i suddenly feel an urge to ask , did he fall from the moon ? 
  we are trading with mexico , and with brazil , and with china . 
  this fellow put all his effort into that , that he will be a good neighbour because of a trade . 
  one needs to be a complete fool - the nation was divided and steered to such a crisis only because we should trade ? 
  a bloody fool . 
  for an ordinary citizen it 's clear as day - the issues being discussed here are not just about a bazaar . 
  n. farage wants to trade . 
  wait a minute . 
  what will people in britain or brits working in eu institutions say ? 
  do they care only about trade , or is it about every aspect of one 's life - education , science , social insurances , wages , pensions ? 
  today 's statement of his - about how we will just trade and that 's it - in truth raises a question , did he or did he not fall from the moon . 
  nobody mentioned a fact , that angry , fierce speeches of our eurosceptics propagate hatred , and are directly linked with a murder of british mp . 
  the felony can be attributed to what kind of public speeches were made this year - brutal , disgusting , without rules , aimed at the lowest instincts . 
  these disgusting demagogues who spread the hatred towards others , towards different-minded , were `` rewarded '' with a real murder . 
  i am sorry that today nobody came and said that j.cox murder was a consequence of this hate-filled and fear-inducing atmosphere . 
  i have absolutely no idea why so many are saying yes and why are they being upvoted - they all are just factually wrong . 
  it 's amazing . 
  to the op - you got many conflicting answers , you 'll have to google and research it yourself . 
  personally i know more than one visitor who entered the schengen from a different country , and did n't even visit the country that had issued the visa ( tho that 's illegal technically but nobody payed attention ) . 
  and please post to those saying ` yes ' here and spreading that disinformation . 
  are you claiming they are involved in a genocide right now ? 
   let me guess : those are turks living in lithuania .
