  the thing is eu immigration is better and immigrants can integrate faster/smoother not because they are white , but because they have more similarities culturally . 
  they just happen to be white . 
  sure they do . 
  that 's where the gaynazijew bacteria comes from . 
   i never tried toilet paper , i suppose it 's taste is closest to the one of tissues depends on whether it is used or not . 
  maybe try giving [ them ] ( http://www.kraustymokomanda.lt/en/branch_in_belgium ) a call ? 
  i have been using their services here in lithuania . 
  they are young , professional , dedicated , helpful . 
  the owners of the company are young guys who seem to really care about the costumer . 
  do n't know about the international moving , especially such a long distance , but probably hearing them out would n't hurt . 
  good luck . 
  what russia ? 
  lichtenstein is the other, 
  actually it depends on the rules of the language it is written in, 
  that 's some story . 
  i am really sorry about your experience and current situation , and really would like to help somehow , do n't know how exactly so far unfortunately . 
  may i ask how you were able to work , study , pay taxes etc ? 
  if you do n't want to answer publicly or at all i will understand completely , and my pm inbox is open for you . 
  i know you are probably getting bugged about that very often , and you answered that question a hundred times , but it 's very hard to browse through your comments , so maybe you could explain once more in few words what happened that you do n't have your passport with you right now ? 
  ( mozhesh i po russki ), 
   under eu rules minorities have rights exactly . 
  they have the same rights as everyone , what ca n't be said about the minorities situation in russia itself . 
  however , my issue with your post was different . 
   guess its ok when eu dictates affairs of other states . . 
  i just wanted to remind you that we ( slovenia also ) are members of eu , so it 's not like `` eu dictates affairs of ** other ** states '' . 
  slovenia and other states agreed to follow rules upon joining the union , and union ( which slovenia is part of ) ensures rules are followed . 
  why would you compare that to russia 's attempts to dictate affairs of ** other ** countries i have no idea . 
  i mean , i have , but do n't want to insult you straight away , so you have some time to backpedal . 
  are you aware slovenia is eu member state and baltics are not under russian umbrella in any way ? 
  dont see your flair and not quite know whats your point is , but wheb you say that it 's ok for eu to dictate policies of other countries , what exactly do you mean by ` other ' , cause sure as hell you cant refer to the eu member like this, 
  sadly most of the russians who came here during soviet occupation were not educated working class . 
   2 % of lithuanian speaking population  there used to be poles and belarusians calling themselves lithuanians you are spot on . 
  even if polish-speakers were almost a half in vilnius in these days , does n't mean they identified themselves as poles or were poles for that matter . 
   i know only the lithuanians school teach the true history we are taught shit in schools . 
  mostly because of the influence of soviet version of history . 
  only now new generation of historians rises , who tries to look at history objectively , without demonising poles f.e. 
  can you say the same ? 
   lithuanian interwar imperialism claimed all of them vilnius was not lithuanian city per se ( it was very multinational and multicultural since the beginning of times , it was even called north jerusalem ) , but it was capital of lithuania , where many of the most important cultural and historical events happened , it was essential for lithuanian culture for centuries . 
  and we never claimed belarusia ( tho as you suggest we might have had ) . 
   no ammount of modern lithuanian denial and propaganda will change any of that . 
  i wish your nation best luck and hope we can closely cooperate in the future despite mutual historical grievances in the past . 
  as i said before - these arguments of who 's who and who done what are absolutely ridiculous . 
  i really do n't even care if everything what / u/bigos said is true or not . 
  we have to look forward and accept borders , cultural , ethnic and linguistic compilation that is now . 
  if polish perspective is some kind of chauvinistic world view who 's only purpose is to insult lithuanians for some reason so be it . 
  i know that you used \u017bmudzinie as a slur , but i really do n't care one way or another . 
  for all i care we , lithuanians , could have descended from gypsies . 
  tho reality is , that version of history / u/bigos wrote is just a very narrow and simplified version . 
  i know it 's taught in polish schools and that 's sad , cause every real historian who is not spewing some kind of propaganda will never say stuff like that . 
  bunch of assumptions , half-trues and fantasies . 
   the date for high speed rail in poland has finally been announced . 
  warsaw to krak\u00f3w in under 2\u00a01/2 hours , warsaw to gda\u0144sk under 3 hours and to wroc\u0142aw in 3:42 . 
  only that last number is really impressive , with the first two routes only shaving 15-30 minutes off the times pkp had in the early 1990s . 
  any news about warszawa-bialystok-lt border line ? 
  within eu migration policies are the same everywhere ( except few newest members ), 
   nato has bases in many countries and still seeks to expand when it was agreed that it would n't happen after the fall of the ussr . 
  i heard that myth ( ? ), 
  million times , and still no one provided the source ( not that i asked or searched myself ) . 
  who , when , to who , and why gave that promise ? 
  on the contrary , i read not so long ago one danish ( ? ), 
  journalist saying there was no promise of that sort and there could n't theoretically be because this even was n't on agenda in 1990 , since gorbachiov had many other issues to deal with and independences of baltic countries were n't even declared/recognized yet . 
  anyways , even if there was some promise by some government official of some country , it was n't in writing , it was n't a treaty or anything like that , and here i come to my next point :  nato seeks to expand i hear that a lot . 
  actually , nato itself does not seek to expand , no one is rushing to accept georgia or ukraine ( or sweden and finland for that matter ) . 
  there was a lot of negativity from old members towards accepting baltics . 
  thing is , it 's not nato expanding ( like some monster who is colonizing new territories ) , it 's that sovereign countries in fear of their security and because of their western oriented views are pushing and asking nato to let them join . 
  baltics made their priority to join eu and nato in the first years when independence was regained , and started working towards that . 
  and as i said , nato did n't open their arms straight away , even us was hesitant . 
  and thank god we did achieve that in time , cause otherwise we would have been considered under the russian zone of influence and things like in georgia/moldova/ukraine might have been happening there . 
  ukrainian leaders up until last month , when russia burned all the bridges as they say , were n't declaring any interest of joining nato , and actually publicly stated they do not want to join . 
  and i can guarantee that at the very least 10 years will pass until ukraine will be ready if ever to do so . 
  so , again , nato is n't expanding per se , it 's not its purpose . 
   we can argue if that supposes a military threat or not yes , i fully understand why russia as such might be afraid of nato/western powers ( well , just look at their history ) , but it 's impossible to even imagine nato would go on offensive on a conventional war scale against nuclear country . 
  nato always was transparent with russia , a lot of treaties exist , one allows to inspect each others military on the ground and from the air ( which russia few months back broke unilaterally ) , also on a diplomatic level there was always cooperation . 
  poland 15 years already in nato , baltics 10 , and still no bases there , no us soldiers , nothing . 
  only 2-4 planes in the airspace rotating from countries like portugal , romania , and us obviously and occasional military exercises for like 300-500 visiting us soldiers . 
  does n't seem like a threat to me . 
  well , if nato was a threat to russia really , i imagine two years after baltics have entered nato there would have been 10k us soldiers located in each of the country alongside with tanks and such . 
  even now , when baltics got really scared because of events in ukraine , everything that has happened is : increased baltic airspace policing ( now it 's 10-20 jets instead of usual 2-4 , also it coincides with increased russian provocations , when they fly straight into our airspace and then suddenly change the course , or are flying near borders with heavy armored planes designed to carry nuclear weapons etc. 
  for some reason no nato jets are testing the waters like that ) , + temporary presence of ~ 500 us soldiers who are participating in exercises throughout the baltics , so far they are deployed until the end of this year , + there were one big military exercises in lithuania with total of ~ 5k soldiers from denmark , uk , poland etc. 
  not really a threat is it ? 
   enlarging into another country sphere of influence we are sovereign countries , we are under no one 's sphere of influence , especially not under russian . 
  the term itself is poisonous . 
  if sovereign country like ukraine chooses not to be under someone 's sphere of influence it should be aloud to do as it wants , and russia ca n't claim nothing . 
  and yet again - nato is not enlarging into ukraine , at least not for a veeery long time if ever . 
   you are saying that both parts are evil but you are sided with one because of a personal interest . 
  i am saying our world is fucked up . 
  and yet it 's the best we got . 
   i have n't seen russia starting any major conflict chechnya , georgia , ukraine . 
   i have seen the us having wars at least officially with afghanistan , iraq , and many more . 
  they did not war with afghanistan . 
  ussr are the ones who wared with afghanistan however . 
  yes , iraq was ugly , it was mistake , i do not support them , however , it 's not like land-grab in georgia or ukraine . 
  and if you want to talk about many more ... should i open ussr war and military interference history ? 
   i am not sure if russia is a threat so how do you call what they are doing in eastern ukraine ? 
  what about my mentioned provocations against baltics ? 
  even against sweden , finland . 
  what about the recent kidnapping of security officer on the estonian soil ? 
  what about moldova and padniestre ? 
  is heavily militarized . 
  in that small piece of land they have more soldiers stationed than baltics have active military personnel combined .
