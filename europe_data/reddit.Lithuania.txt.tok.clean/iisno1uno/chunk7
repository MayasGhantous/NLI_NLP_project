  and i suppose you are not ukrainian who 's country is under attack by the putin 's regime , and you dont need to rely on international help to stop him, 
  you confused those a countries again . 
  you are from the other one, 
  oh believe me i blame german government alright . 
  for a lot that 's happening now, 
  i mean * lithuanian diplomat * is a bit misleading, 
  well they crossed the border that is not controlled by ukrainian army , and straight into the hands of separatists, 
  he is not lithuanian tho, 
  also means kingland . 
  you might be on to something, 
  i 'm really shocked a lot of people do not see anything wrong in it . 
  it 's fashion show , they could literally just have walked all the time in circles with their dresses on . 
  but no , kids must have been used to portray ukraine as aggressive , suicidal state . 
  meaning it is going downhill , other countries are trying to stop ukraine . 
  the fact that everyone is holding hands in the hand is meaningless , it 's a performance for god 's sake , everyone is holding hands after every performance . 
  of course , if you are comparing this show with the one with the bikers , they are totally different thank god . 
  however , this is where everything is going . 
  inb4 kids will form swastika and bash ukraine . 
  and ukraine is the one who wants to kill/kills herself while pointing guns at everyone else before that . 
  it 's a kid show ffs , even having fake guns on the scene is outrageous . 
  and the political context add to that . 
  can you imagine any other country where such a show could take place ? 
  magazin means shop in russian , so it 's quite relevant i would say , 
  the thing is empty magazines are the proof of how hard putin is hitting them, 
  do n't lie you are not bored , you are just happy that finnish language is into relevance, 
  do n't even try to argue with this guy . 
  it 's just a waste of time . 
  he has one big mess in the head . 
  so called anarchist says things like `` twitter account should require id scan to open the account so people that do n't behave can end up in jail '' . 
  also , i did kinda end up in the argument with him , and that 's what [ happened ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2d5bat/finnish_support_for_joining_nato_increasing_poll/cjn436b ) . 
  so , my advice , just let it go . 
  ok , so ca n't comment much about other cities , but the truth is vilnius is growing . 
  a lot of people that are seen as `` leaving '' vilnius are actually resettling in the suburbs , the metro area which is not included in the statistics . 
  tho the biggest problem to date is that people working , renting apartments , using public transportation etc , are registered at their parents house somewhere in the province of lithuania . 
  actually unofficial estimates say the `` live '' population of vilnius is ~ 850k and should hit million mark in the next few years . 
  why are n't they burning russian flag ? 
  russia is the one who banned fruit import, 
   russia could never be that drunk on power to think that would fly for even a second . 
  debatable . 
  regardless , what we ( baltics ) are most afraid of ( for now ) are provocations . 
  russia are testing waters every day in many different ways . 
  there are quite big and not well integrated russian minority in latvia . 
  it could be a starting point somehow . 
  another example is bulgaria , which is quite pro-russian itself . 
  what if they make nato look like unable to act somehow , by organizing provocations there so even bulgaria would not want nato involved , and/or changing bulgaria 's course by 180 \u00b0 . 
  may i remind you nato/eu are pushing for some reforms that bulgaria 's political elite is not very happy about . 
  so that 's how white hart lane looks like, 
   unless orban does n't understand how to use the phrase either i think that 's the case . 
  i think this saying comes from english language originally , cause it 's rarely used f.e. 
  in lithuanian language . 
  however , the first time i read orban 's words , and in general , when someone uses that phrase in lithuanian language , it means `` i hurt myself '' and not `` i hurt myself unintentional '' . 
   shooting yourself in the foot means what you intended to do to someone else , happened to you instead . 
  and what linkevi\u010dius is saying that we intentionally shot ourselfs in the foot , because russia got hurt more . 
  so what exactly is the problem ? 
  i get that you argue that `` shooting yourself in the foot '' means that it was unintentional , however that 's where the tricky part comes in ( meaning context ) and that 's why he gives such a `` witty '' response . 
  you can argue about the correct usage of the term , and yet everyone ( except you ) understood the meaning and everyone is happy . 
  so i am afraid i can not answer your question `` what am i doing with my time ? '', 
  i * hope * it 's not as unheard in europe as bicycle lanes in romania , but here 's [ sand dunes ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/47417333.jpg ) of curonian spit . 
  in the cold ( ish ) and green lithuania it is as rare view as you can get . 
   you get the idea . 
  yep . 
  itt rich countries look poor , poor ones look rich . 
  well it 's not so black and white as it may seem . 
  what if russia smuggles the polite green men into romania/bulgaria/latvia / whatever and then with the help of some anti-european russian loyalists starts some independence movement ? 
  what he 's saying that actions like that would get nato response rather than be left to deal for the local police/military . 
  why do you think that `` shooting yourself in the foot '' means that russia was n't hurt too ?

  ** lithuania ** * two-time olympic and two-time world discus throwing champion virgilijus alekna announced his retirement at the age of 42 .

  damn , ask.fm is your product yet again ? 
  just like in one.lt times , every teenager over here has one of these accounts . 
   but i already gave you a source where lithuania has already agreed on it . 
  you are kinda new to all the international agreement policy and signatures of intentions etc ? 
  until there will be specific sums and specific technical details , everything what is agreed on is just `` let 's build railbaltic '' . 
  there is connection vilnius-daugavpils , but it 's operated by russians and the price for such a trip is 4 times bigger than by bus . 
  connection vilnius-warsawa also exists , however now because of railbaltica works in progress it is operated by buses . 
  before the railbaltica works started price for such a trip was reasonable , but it took a looong time , since it had to change gauge near the lithuania/poland border and because of low speed network . 
   i am saying that the thing currently under construction in lithuania is not rail baltic because it does n't connect any baltic states to each other . 
  or yet again delusions kick in ? 
  rail baltica is one of the priority projects of the european union : trans-european transport networks ( ten-t ) . 
  the project is supposed to link finland , the baltic states and poland and also improve the connection between central and northern europe and germany . 
  it envisages a continuous rail link from tallinn ( estonia ) , to warsaw ( poland ) , going via riga ( latvia ) and kaunas ( lithuania ) . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/transport/wcm/infrastructure/ten-t_map_project_portfolio.pdf go ahead , have fun reading and enlightening yourself . 
  problem is not with me , rather with you `` not calling it railbaltic '' when everyone in eu is doing so . 
   i seriously doubt about lithuania 's interest in it . 
  should i repeat myself 4th time ? 
  lithuania does n't have as big as interest to be connected to estonia as estonia has interest to be to connected to lithuania . 
  that 's why we will not agree on expensive and unnecessary ( for us ) 240km/h project .
