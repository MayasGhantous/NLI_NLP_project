  minimum wage is one of the lowest in eu . 
  it is lower than in poland , latvia , estonia even if we have better gdp per capita . 
  the same applies to average salary . 
  during crisis people were exploited because of high unemployment , but this is changing and it is good . 
  also vat increase was good as it is harder to hide these money in black market , unlike taxes which are paid with salary . 
  alright , that was a bit offensive wording . 
  these professions should be picked only by people who know that they are doing and very limited numbers . 
  but situation here is different . 
  i 'm glad you do well . 
  but that does n't change a fact that humanitarian professions end at the [ bottom ] ( http://www.kurstoti.lt/uploads/images/darbo_rinkoje.jpg ) in labor market . 
  yes , why study profession where you earn at least double country average salaries , when you can take humanities studies and work for 300 . 
  would be intresting to see what effect it would be if west countries offered tents and food for the duration of the wars . 
  now they offer much more and wonders why africans and asians want to come . 
  and because these policies create this mess you want other poor countries to be a prison for these migrants . 
  i 'm pretty sure lithuanian numbers dropped after putin found a new playground . 
  i do n't twist facts . 
  i show you why other countries `` like '' russia so much . 
  and it is russia who fails to acknowledge committed crimes . 
  and it is russia who is building monuments for one of the biggest murderer - stalin . 
  democide count is from `` death by government '' by r. j. rummel . 
  murders by ussr - 61,9 m , nazi - 20,9 m. 
  not sure that you are trying to prove . 
  today lithuanian woman was acquitted from previous 10 year prison sentence for planning to commit terrorist act . 
  police actions ( to wait till she decides to leave a country and gather information ) was viewed as provocation . 
  our hotels got 5 % more tourists last year . 
  biggest increase ( not total number , but % ) is from norway , ukraine , italy , gb , decrease - russia , belarus . 
  most tourists come from germany , russia , belarus ( descending order ) . 
  here is russian [ gdp ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2015&amp;ey=2015&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=91&amp;pr1.y=11&amp;c=922&amp;s=ngdp_r%2cngdpd%2cpppgdp%2cpppex&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) estimates by imf . 
  ~ ~ like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01tzi47fhfc ) ? ~ ~ it seems it is fake . 
  make agreement with lebanon to take them . 
  fund lebanon camps more . 
  deport them to camps . 
  just follow australian model . 
  they ca n't sent them away . 
  you ca n't send people to japan and say - `` hey , take them . 
  we do n't want them '' . 
  eu needs to start following the laws and simply do n't grant refugee status if they enter illegally . 
  the only chance to get into eu as refugee should be from syria bordering countries camps . 
  so if swedes wants 1m refugees - they take them from camp instead of creating mess on the route to promised lands . 
  well , few years ago it was 2 % or 3 % ( + fixed connection fee ) for small shops in lithuania . 
  so i 'm not sure if it is eu thing . 
  maybe euro `` thing '' . 
  i have no idea how much it costs now . 
  yes , latest navigation [ gear ] ( http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/these-russian-attack-jets-use-walmart-grade-gps-systems-1703048443 ) ... 
  except plane did n't flight straight and did multiple loops in turkey airspace . 
  and probably pilot was warned before entering turkey . 
  otherwise there is no way turkey f-16 could catch russian plane in 5s time like you write . 
  why police did n't return stolen coffee to the owner ? 
  they knew about the robbery so owner is known . 
  i write the same . 
  except initial line is longer and finishing at bottom left . 
  latvia salary is after taxes it seems . 
  there is no way we are earning twice than them . 
  it would be interesting to see this chart with taxes subtracted from earnings . 
  there is no point to go to greece for asylum . 
  that country ca n't give anything more than camps at syrian border . 
  and migrants know that . 
  so long as there are rich countries supporting illegal migration over europe people will do that . 
  lithuanians opinion : poland is friendly 53 % in 2006 , poland is friendly 13 % ( 24 % hostile ) in 2014 . 
  poll questions might be slightly different but still those numbers does n't look good . 
  it seems tomaszewski uses minorities well . 
  it was way higher for poland earlier . 
  do n't know how well j\u00f3n gnarr did , but lithuanian parliament was awful at that time . 
  that party members consisted from not the brightest minds , but clowns literally ( with few exceptions ) . 
  in 2008 15 % of voters in lithuania voted for `` national resurrection party '' . 
  that party consisted from various tv `` stars '' . 
  can you imagine government run by clowns ? 
  meaning - fugitive ( refugee ) . 
  probably like 30 persons if camp is well funded . 
  just think how many people could be supported with resources some countries are going to use locally ( $ 40bn could support at least 40 million of people ) . 
  source ? 
  refugee camp budget in jordan is 400m $ for one million people . 
  but according unhcr they have less than half needed money . 
  it is from lagoon side as sea side is almost straight . 
  plays mostly electronic and indie music . 
  no ads and no biebers . 
  this week our delegation failed to find a single syrian family for relocation from greece . 
  nobody wants to go here . 
  you have to motivate them . 
  [ lithuanian pm : we need to ` motivate ' refugees to choose lithuania ] ( http://en.delfi.lt/lithuania/foreign-affairs/lithuanian-pm-we-need-to-motivate-refugees-to-choose-lithuania.d?id=69217892 ), 
  countries agreed to distribute x amount of people and not for mandatory quota distribution . 
  we even negotiated to have our own selection criteria . 
  yes you are missing a point - more efficient diesel engine leads to more nox polution . 
  to counter that you can decrease efficiency or use [ nox absorber ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nox_adsorber ) more often ( not sure about absorber changes as i did n't fully understand if it is active in current cars ) . 
  in both cases fuel economy goes down . 
  it is not lithuanian and not typical . 
  there are no penalties in brell ring agreement . 
  notification period for termination of agreement is 6 months . 
  russians wanted to increase that to 10 years , but that did n't happen . 
  it is not sketchy as `` sekmas '' means seven in old lithuanian . 
  and it is in lithuanian vocabulary . 
  yes , they do . 
  especially latvia ( 40-60 % higher ) . 
  ah , you are statistics guy !, 
  that 's right if person makes more than 260 $ he is not in poverty ( according our statistics department ) . 
  too bad for him because that money gives living place without utilities and food . 
  are you telling me that people earning 380 $ are not living in poverty ? 
  to rent apartment with utilities costs 300-400 $ . 
  is it enough ? 
  food , transportation and basic good are not needed ?
