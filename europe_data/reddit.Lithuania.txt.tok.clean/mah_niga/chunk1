dat question in / r/europe, 
  how drunk are you that you think land has feelings ? 
  but yeah , i agree . 
  crimea should be part of ukraine . 
  it will come from norway , but the problem with us is not in distance . 
  there is no free trade agreement between us and eu . 
  and exporters of lng from us need license ( or smth like that ) to export it to countries without agreement . 
  actually i 'm not . 
  i do n't know why , but like 90 % of stories about poland in one of the biggest newspaper that we are subscribed to involves religion . 
  it 's like your joke of the day section in newspaper . 
  i hope it 's not intentional , but it kinda looks like it . 
  the other times that we can read about poland is when polish government fucks up or simply there is some scandal . 
  it 's not a shitty joke . 
  it 's just that people who identify themselves as polish hardly speak it . 
  younger generation do n't know polish ( exception is if they went to polish school ) . 
  then there are those old , old ones that speak a mix of polish/russian/lithuanian and in middle we have the soviet era where they speak russian . 
   catholic like there 's any other way in poland :d, 
   there is no sizeable russian minority in lithuania [ but just look at this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/poles_in_lithuania_barry_kent.png ) we have quite a lot of them . 
  lol . 
  good luck speaking to them in polish :d, 
  nice one . 
  did n't see this one before . 
  indeed it does . 
  and i see it ( poles in vilnius ) being said by poles quite a lot , but i tend to think that lithuanians are offended not only by that annexation , but because it happened literally two days after signing agreement of our borders . 
  it 's just like a knife into your back . 
   because the suwa\u0142ki treaty was harmful and against poles . 
  after polish-soviet war everything have changed oh yes , indeed . 
  everything has changed in two days . 
   poles were forcibly lithuanized in kaunas ( kowno ) which before lithuanian independence had only 20 % of lithuanians ( vilnius/wilno had only 3 % ) well after independence a lot of people moved from villages to cities . 
  i do n't think they were forcibly lithuanized , but some probably were to some extent . 
  like first poland 's president was a lithuanian , while his brother was one of the guys who signed lithuania 's independence act . 
   lithuanian government declared lithuanian as the only language of lithuania forbidings usage of any nonlithuanian language . 
  well this just sounds like bullshit . 
   generally inhabiants were happy that they belong to poland , the hell became with lithuanian occupation of 1939 [ lithuanian scholars being forcibly removed from their dormitory by polish officials ] ( http://kernius.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/lietuviai-vilnius-1926.jpg )  wile\u0144szczyzna wtf is this shit ? 
   lithuanian nazi squads well that 's some new shit . 
  please tell me more . 
   poles want our old lands back . 
  please tell me when have poland held vilnius before braking suwalki agreement ( two days after signing it ) ? 
   we should n't fight . 
  no hate , but as you said :  you need to take some historical facts, 
   ukraine  recognizing false referendum-occupation lel, 
  yes , we do . 
  what ? 
  you should feel like a shitposter, 
  i get what you are planning . 
  shitpost everywhere and get points, 
  hm ... and i thought erasmus was about studies . 
  why ? 
  why should i support it ? 
  why should working people support it ? 
  why should educated people with well payed jobs support it ? 
  why should small countries like baltics support it ? 
  why should uk support it ? 
  why ? 
  gt8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8, 
  have to agree . 
  i always go to kaunas from vilnius and other way round with train . 
  i think they could be more filled . 
  busses can be nice , but i find trains much more comfortable . 
  also , i consider some destinations like vilnius -  trakai or vilnius -  ignalina in summer quite nice . 
   that said , all of my posts itt just got down by five points . 
  there are some people on this subreddit that are really obsessed with what at first seems to be a minor issue . 
  well you wanting belarussian opposition to look like nazies is not so minor issue, 
  yeah . 
  spent few weeks there . 
  it was n't too interesting, 
  [ mercedes-benz museum ] ( http://www.mercedes-benz-classic.com/content/classic/mpc/mpc_classic_website/en/mpc_home/mbc/home/museum/home.flash.html ) in stuttgart . 
  it 's really amazing and if you are into cars you can spend whole opening hours there . 
  i 'm not so into cars , but i still managed to spend 4-5 hours there . 
  [ porsche museum ] ( http://www.porsche.com/international/aboutporsche/porschemuseum/ ) is also nice , but for the same price i 'd preffer to go to mercedes-benz museum . 
  why does this shit even get posted here ? 
  yeah , i understand and i wo n't be using it . 
  still i appreciate the effort put in . 
  i 'm not excited on this . 
  i mean it just got filtered because it is a main problem/topic in europe now . 
  i do n't think we should be filtering out main problems and live in our imaginary world . 
  i see you had put that as your flair text . 
  although , there was no heterosexual in your comment . 
  yeah , i mean there quite a lot of personnel and other stuff . 
  also russia has quite a lot . 
  and latvia is not even in eastern europe, 
  `` smart comment '', 
  as much as being the largest in europe - does n't hurt . 
  indeed . 
  that 's why first poland 's president was a lithuanian - he was not smart enough to stay in lithuania , but stupid enough to become poland 's president, 
  tagged as `` stupid polish '' . 
  still hanging on it . 
  well i do n't think small countries should spend a lot more on defense compared to bigger countries , unless they were alone . 
  it would just be a start to military dictatorship . 
  all major parties in lithuania agreed and signed something like a deal or memorandum to increase defence budget . 
  and we actually made progress now . 
  ^ we ^ passed ^ 1 %, 
  well top of my head : fertilizers , vegetables , grain , textile , refined petroleum . 
  [ here 's a treemap of export ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/hs/export/ltu/all/show/2012/ ), 
  yay . 
  lithuania flag on the map xd, 
  because it 's insane, 
  yeah , i expected something like that, 
  i do n't really think , you would like to test that . 
  yeah , but even i , a lithuanian , that strongly opposes russia think that this is insane .
