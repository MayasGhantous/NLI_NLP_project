  * in the world, 
  one can be both nationalist and pro-eu . 
  a wee different eu though ... 
  we got reasons for suicide for far more than 7 days . . , 
  biggest to smallest . 
  for me , it 's more natural to say february 5th rather than 5th of february . 
  year there is just to keep consistent . 
  anyhow , i 'd tolerate day/month/year if there was n't month/day/year . 
  see https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/52vcxx/names_of_weekdays_in_various_european_languages/d7nmqvk, 
  except for 4/6/7 ? 
  and 1/2/3 / 5 seems to be off by 1 day :|, 
  unless you practice a lot with \u0160e\u0161ios \u017e\u0105sys su \u0161e\u0161iais \u017e\u0105sy\u010diais or pakopa po pakopos , pakopa po pakopos , 
  well , sepmadienis would technically make sense . 
  it 's just not natural to pronounce . 
  fuck you , we 'll just count the damn days \\ - latvia and lithuania, 
  we also have this sekmin\u0117s thing . 
  which is on 7th week after easter . 
  `` sepmadienis '' would sound super weird and unnatural . 
  so it evolved p -  k to `` sekmadienis '' . 
  i hear they have pretty good military infrastructure already . 
  looks good !, 
   geographically pretty much in the centre of the continent so [ vilnius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_midpoint_of_europe ) then ? 
  might not be that far from a potential front line though . . 
  you could change countries in your post to more western and it 'd sound as convincing . 
  dude ... 
  i said that * some * people are cunts . 
  i did n't say that britons are not to blame either . 
  i 'm glad you 're good person and do n't talk shit . 
  too bad some people i 've met are not as sweet . 
  well , they had a good excuse why they did n't defend ukraine . 
  there 's no excuse to not defend baltic states . 
  if they did n't defend them , even if some show-off troops were stationed , nobody would believe regroup , 
  the best example is ukraine . 
  even though it was n't nato member , whole eastern europe freaked out . 
  there in lithuania , pro-russian voices got a lot stronger , saying that nato would n't defend us . 
  let 's warm up to russia . 
  and they received some public support . 
  it looks like that was the case throughout ee . 
  usa is now putting a lot of resources over there to keep us calm . 
  and people still are worrisome . 
  i could only imagine what would happen if a full nato member was attacked or even annexed . 
  and if it was n't defended by nato as a whole . 
  why do you think so ? 
  once one member is touched and not defended , other small members will get cold feet too . 
  sure , usa/uk/fr / de will be bffs in foreseeable future . 
  but that 's not what nato is . 
  nato is primarily a political tool to ensure small member 's security . 
  once nato stops doing that , insecure nations will flock to whomever can defend them . 
  because everybody 's line who is important and who is not would be different . 
  if baltic states can be taken and nato does nothing , maybe poland or finland is not important enough too ? 
  bulgaria ? 
  once touching some members is ok , touching any member becomes ok . 
  i did n't mean to say that this is very common . 
  but messed up bulbs do exist . 
  it 's sad to hear `` those fat lazy pigs do n't deserve their wealth '' from immigrants . 
  those fucktards usually failed back at home thanks to this mindset and then emigrated . 
  so it 's not pointed towards locals specifically . 
  they 're just angry at everybody . 
  now pair it with a pint or two and a bar full of chavs . . 
  just to play devil 's advocate there ... 
  some lithuanian immigrants in the uk ( as well as in other we countries ) are total cunts . 
  they talk shit about locals and laugh at them all the time . 
  i assume some poles act similarly . 
  i would n't be surprised if the pole dude said stupid things and englishmen got offended . 
  20:1 ai n't nice in any case . 
  as well as any violence . 
  on top of that , some regions in lithuania have rates twice that . 
  the record is set by kupi\u0161kis region - 71.9 . 
  remember girls , down the road , not across the street . . 
  no they wo n't what ? 
  are you saying that people immigrating to rather homogenous country is the same as different people coming to a new place at the same time ? 
  huh ? 
  awesome argument . 
  if migration would involve paperwork/visas/permits / etc , it 'd would be significantly lower . 
  people who really want to move would do it . 
  people who do n't care that much , would n't . 
  language , family , customs and overall moving to a different place concerns will still be there . 
  it will take several generations to make it vanish , if ever . 
  depends on what kind of globalisation . 
  i 'm all for global trade , sharing science stuff and so on . 
  but i do n't like the `` centralisation '' bit , which means overcrowded megacities and vanishing differences of cultures . 
  i 'd prefer globalisation that means working together . 
  rather than moving in together . 
  sure , some expats do come back and start businesses . 
  but it 's mostly people who would start business one way or the other . 
  but most of the `` investing '' is just buying real estate for retirement/parents/etc . 
  which adds up to real estate prices inflation , wether this is good or bad . 
  we do have various problems . 
  but if people who have problems just get up and leave , that does n't solve the problems . 
  and some infrastructure problems just get bigger . 
  for example , rural health care and education . 
   and after that poland and romania will attract british , spanish or french too there 're already quite a few expats from the west . 
  they come due to lower costs though . 
  which , as you said , is getting less and less lower . 
  i do n't think we 'll ever see as massive numbers west -  east migration as we have the other way . 
  what should happen to make a common man have an incentive to make such a move ? 
   in the internet era globalization is a fact , but it will still take some time before everyone accepts it . 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  but i 'm saying that , imo , this fact is not good long-term . 
   because intraeu immigration is a good concept .
