  or mostly towards , as you said , non-brits . 
  by this measure , literally any country in the world is bad . 
  no country accepts everybody from any country without any conditions . 
  which kinda makes sense imo . 
  which of these is a race ? 
  far-right = = nazis/fascists/etc in my books . 
  there 's a big distance between being on the right of spectrum and being `` far-right '' . 
  as i said , being anti immigration is being strict on work permits . 
  if they 're profiled by race , then it 's racist . 
  if they 're profiled by sex , then it 's sexist . 
  if they 're profiled by employment/careers/etc , then it 's careerist i guess . 
  may does not want to deport `` black doctors '' or smth like that , thus it 's not racist . 
  or is `` eu citizen '' a race now ? 
  most of what you listed is much much more than being just `` anti immigrant '' , which would be just being more strict on giving new work permits . 
  i do n't see anything even remotely `` far right '' in what may said about doctors too . 
  i 'm saying that if far-right bar is that low today , how low is communism bar ? 
  by your standards , it looks like anything off the center-left is far-right . 
  so being anti-immigration is literally a nazi now ? 
  is any kind of welfare worse than communism too ? 
  v\u0117darai is traditional lithuanian food too . 
  no idea wether we or belarussians came up first or just happened at the same time . 
  we have [ blood + cereal version ] ( http://www.delfi.lt/1000receptu/receptai/zemaitiskai-kraujiniai-vedarai.d?id=67067828 ) as well, 
  germany : give us 10 turns to prepare, 
  1274 never forget, 
  i 'm surprised latvians do n't join us :(, 
  the pro-migrant people sometimes look like latent racists . 
  they think their culture/country/race / whatever is so superior that anybody just given opportunity will follow their way and become just like them . 
  people with resources are not necessarily the educated/smart ones . 
  sure , some smart people do come . 
  but proportionally much more opportunist scum joins them . 
  while educated people are held back by their families and stuff . 
  yes i did . 
  after first few fails , i do n't bother with the rest with similar ingredients . 
  although i 'd like to support local/smaller manufacturers , nutella it is ... 
  which , to be fair , is pretty good . 
  peanut butter is a problem too . 
  most grocery shops carry only crappy ones . 
  fortunately there 're some places to get hold of the real thing . 
  the core issue may be that chocolate/peanut/etc spreads are not common over there . 
  traditionally there 're all kinds of meat/veggie/cheese spreads . 
  chocolate/peanut spreads were n't a thing until recently . 
  there 's not much market for them , people do n't know how it 's supposed to taste and there 's no local mass production . 
  i do n't care about brand , all i want is damn spread . 
  over there , there 're no non-nutella but not-shitty-cheap spreads . 
  i tried most of them and they 're sugary as fuck . 
  it 's not just `` different taste '' . 
  and boutique stuff is not just `` premium spread '' ( which would be nice ) , but the whole `` made by 105 y/o nana off the grid bla bla bla '' bullshit . 
  which is whole next level of food idolising . 
  in the end , nutella , even if it 's not the original thing ( tm ) , is the only ok-ish option . 
  which kinda sucks . 
  but you 're right , it does n't suck that much . 
  2nd world problems i guess ? 
  there 're already some shops doing that . 
  they seem to import mostly laundry stuff and cookies ( which are great ) . 
  hope they 'll start doing nutella or overall on-request stuff too . 
  taste buds do n't help if thing is good enough-ish and you do n't compare side-by-side . 
  what else should i do if i want nutella-like spread ? 
  over there , there 're some super shitty alternatives , would n't buy them ever . 
  the only other nutella alternative is making one at home . 
  which is both messy and expensive in small quantities . 
  there may be some boutique-store-home-made-premium stuff but paying literally 10x for `` fair trade eco '' alternative is not my thing . . 
  thus nutella it is . 
  lindt masterrace !, 
  probably one of very few mass produced chocolates that are good . 
  then you guys should fix your platform from inside and remove assholes . 
  or let 's build a new platform that 'd be for fairness and equality . 
  and anybody with tumblr account would be banned  i hope feminism/social justice can get back to it 's core . 
  but so far . . it looks worse and worse year after year . 
  yea , he should just head home . 
  fuckin brasilians occupying portugal and forcing their language . 
  looking at recent us election and stuff , it looks like those things i kinda opposites these days : /, 
  their `` equality '' seems to have turned to preferential treatment these days . 
  i 'm strongly against any kind of affirmative action or quotas . 
  a lot of their `` equality '' seem to end up establishing x-only days/festivals/etc . 
  i 'm also for all-goes freedom of speech . 
  i want you to have a right to offend me . 
  these people seem to prefer a very complicated kind of `` freedom of speech '' which involves a lot of no-nos what is ok and what is not . 
  latest example - lithuania 's independence was announced by men-only committee . 
  given that it was 1918 , it 's kinda . . natural . 
  women were given a right to vote in constitution compiled by the same committee though , back in 1918 . 
  now some feminists/sjws say that independence day is `` men 's day '' and they want separate `` women 's independence day '' . 
  i kid you not . 
  and this is not some lone 15y/o tumbler . 
  this shit was on national tv and everything . 
  sorry , but i do n't see how this platform goes for `` equality '' . 
  and the platform sucks . 
  it 's tall pyramid and it 's set up to fight for x/y/z , but not for universal equality and freedom of speech . 
  it 'd take a shitload of work to override this . 
  i do n't feel like working for a platform that i do n't agree with for the sake of fundamentally changing it . 
  i think he means people are bored by social justice as the current platform . 
  at least from sidelines , it looks to be highly geared towards name-any-minority . 
  turning the wave to fight for the true equality seem to be next to impossible . 
  why bother ? 
  we love georgians there . 
  armenians are ok too . 
  funny thing is , there 's a lot of money spent on all kinds of social programmes . 
  how much of it is spent on making having kids easy & fancy ? 
  if there was as much political will to make people have babies instead of pushing { insert identity politics issue here } we could solve the birth rate thing in a generation or two . 
  what about `` humanitarian superpower '' aka sweden ? 
  their mainstream parties seem to be kinda keen on immigration .
