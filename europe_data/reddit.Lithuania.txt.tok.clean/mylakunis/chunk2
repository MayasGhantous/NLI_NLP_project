  maybe you think being sent away to siberia when you 're a 14 year old girl is a fun experience then yes the soviets were very nice people . 
  nobody said nazis were good , but they sure were better to my granparents , and to my boyfriends grandparents , i 'm just speaking from personal experience . 
  perfect example of an ignorant russian ladies and gentlemen . 
  i mean how low can you go ? 
  damn you are brainwashed as fuck , just like russians here in lithuania . 
  ukrainians should deport every single ethnic russian back to motherland and problem solved . 
  in my mind they are . 
  soviets did more harm than anyone else to my family so yeah . 
   check . 
  um so donetsk is in russia now ? 
  by saying nazis fighting nazis i mean the german nazis fighting the soviets . 
  it 's not the same in donetsk . 
  donetsk is in ukraine and is a part of ukraine and ethnic russians are causing chaos and occupying administrations . 
  forest brothers were lithuanias , estonias , latvians fighting on ** their ** soil and for ** their ** freedom . 
  so do n't compare them . 
  did anyone leave the eu ? 
  the only country that wants to leave the eu is england and it 's understandable . 
  why would i apologize for nazis fighting nazis ? 
  and do n't forget about the [ forest brothers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_brothers ) , these guys were good and did their job well . 
  and also the maidan activists that were trained in lithuania ? 
  [ okay ] ( http://iphone-mods.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/dmitrii_medvedev_s_iphone.jpg ), 
  all those non-important countries have a rising economy , and people are getting a better quality of life and education . 
  unlike you , you probably still have a carpet on your wall and a picture of putin . 
  lithuania admits and acknowledges these events . 
  there is no question about it . 
  germany acknowledges , admits and apologized for their atrocities in ww2 . 
  [ russia denies ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4517683.stm ) the occupation of baltic states and does not apologize . 
  the same thing happened in crimea , and you are dumb enough to believe that everything is legal , and you just took back something that belonged to you afterall . 
  history is repeating itself . 
  ah yes it does , glorious times . 
  but you are forgetting a couple fo things , we did n't try to exterminate russians and the russian language , we did n't send anyone to gulags , we did n't destroy russian schools , and forbid to speak in russian . 
  we did n't try to destroy your culture . 
  in other words we did not do a genocide , unlike you . 
  so ... why are you calling us `` pizdanutyje pribalty '' ? 
  i do n't get it ? 
  what did we ever do to russia ? 
  im not quoting you , i 'm speaking of russians in general . 
  i have many russian friends ( and some of them are no longer my friends just because they were ignorant ) . 
  and they all blamed america for everything . 
  do n't you watch russian tv ? 
  all they do is blame the west . 
  that 's funny because you blame everything on america . 
  people wrote hundreds of replies here of why we blame russia , and you still do n't get it , this just shows how ignorant you are . 
  how would you feel if russian soldiers came to your house one day , raided your house , put you in your basement and dropped a grenade ? 
  you tried to exterminate every intelligent person by sending them to gulags . 
  and so many years later there 's not even a fucking apology for the atrocities that you 've done , instead you fucking celebrate `` den pobedy '' , like you 're heroes or some shit . 
  fuck that . 
  yeah , just googled it , basically we import petroleum , process it and then export it . 
  lithuania 21 % unclassified transactions ? 
  can someone explain this to me . 
  it 's not that cold to be honest , the cold starts only in northern norway . 
  and i agree on canada . 
  nope , never . 
  healthcare seems to be very weak , and too much crime in some areas . 
  i would love to visit however . 
  this propaganda is shown on russian tv channels every single fucking day . 
  i watched a couple of shows myself , and i nearly vomited at the amount of bullshit that was shown there . 
  and actually , one russian channel in particular was banned in lithuania for 3 months . 
  the guy that is handing the oscar says that it is dedicated to this tv channel and a tv-show host dmitri kisilev . 
  [ the show is called `` vesti nedeli '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tmgrwwr1mi ) and was full of russian propaganda and misinformation about the current events in ukraine . 
  smooth criminal . 
  but vitia , these 2 videos are completely different . 
  in the main video the guys were just standing , peacefully , and the berkut guy slapped something from his hand , started yelling at them and then the beating began ... for no apparent reason . 
  but in the video that you showed us the protesters were extremely violent . 
  so i do n't see a reason to beat someone up , just arrest the guys . 
  end of story . 
  ca n't say that they are related , just some similarities . 
  oh i remember trying to learn finnish , pronunciation was very easy for me as it has some similarities to lithuanian . 
  but the grammar ... damn . 
  btw , the word `` laiva '' ( ship ) is `` laivas '' in lithuanian . 
  you actually do n't make sense in that comment , and many users pointed out why including me . 
  but you fail to see that you provided a bunch of made up arguments and crappy sources . 
  this is exactly what i am talking about . 
  the programme `` law and order '' and the channel pbk got banned for 3 months . 
  oh , and by the way the host of this tv-show , he is sitting in [ duma ] ( http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2,_%d0%90%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%b9_%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%ba%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%87#.d0.9f.d0.be.d0.bb.d0.b8.d1.82.d0.b8.d1.87.d0.b5.d1.81.d0.ba.d0.b0.d1.8f_.d0.b4.d0.b5.d1.8f.d1.82.d0.b5.d0.bb.d1.8c.d0.bd.d0.be.d1.81.d1.82.d1.8c ) , coincidence ? 
  some points you mentioned like russians are saying that lithuanian aras was shooting from the roofs . 
  okay , lets analyze : several victims with multiple gunshot wounds ( 5 shots , 3 shots , etc. 
  ) , several victims with shots to the head . 
  do n't forget it 's nightime , and they are shooting from roofs . 
  sounds realistic . 
  next , you mention the victim [ loreta asanavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 ] ( http://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/loreta_asanavi%c4%8di%c5%abt%c4%97 ) . 
  her legs got run over by a tank , [ here is video footage of her in the hospital ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls23l7eqswi#t=105 ) ( nsfw ) . 
  i recommend watching [ this footage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebtgkqrd8y ) without any commentaries , so you can see everything that happened . 
  paleckis is spreading the same propaganda that `` law and order '' is spreading , and yes what he said to the press is slander . 
  it 's his opinion though , so he can keep it to himself . 
  and yes , there is a law that can put you to jail if you are found guilty . 
  as the wiki article says :  `` viktor viktorovich shatskikh ( b. 
  1961 ) -- lieutenant group ` a ' service office mto 7 of the kgb . 
  mortally wounded by a bullet 5.45 mm passing through the slit in body armor ( died from a ricochet bullet shot by a fellow soldier inside the lithuanian national radio and television building ) . 
  he was awarded the order of red banner ( posthumously ) . '', 
  yes accidents happen when you shoot blindly at 3am . 
  he was one of the victims just like the other 12 . 
  do n't really get the part where you said that nazi symbols are paraded . 
  swastika is banned in all public places . 
  just like the soviet symbols . 
  and there was an [ investigation ] ( http://www.prokuraturos.lt/pirmaspuslapis/rezonansin%c4%97sbylos/itd%c4%97l19910113%c4%afvyki%c5%b3lietuvoje/tabid/485/default.aspx ) of the events of january 13th . 
  all of these events are proven and were investigated . 
  people saw it with their own eyes . 
  this wall of text that you wrote just shows you that you were brainwashed by russian media . 
  not sure if there are any candidates for president right now .
