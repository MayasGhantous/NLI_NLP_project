yes , this our mp is of the same kind of right wing conformist gays . 
  he 's like this not because of self-hatred . 
  he has got a quite clever political agenda . 
   however now , 12 years later , 60 euros can buy way fewer stuff than 10.000 pesetas used to . 
  first of all , euro was introduced in spain at midnight on 1 january 1999 , which was not 12 , but almost 16 years ago . 
  but it does n't really matter . 
  what matters is that : * total consumer prices inflation since euro adoption in spain was 46.1 % . 
  * which means a whopping 2.1719 % per year on average . 
  * which is normal .

  are you from vilnius ? 
  vilnia ( or viln ** e ** l\u0117 ) is not on the other side of the cathedral , it is on this side . 
  the confluence of neris and vilnia would be actually visible in this very picture , if the haze would n't be that thick . 
  the two rivers meet a bit to the left from the white building , the arsenal . 
  that is all . 
  nothing else of any importance happened in the uk this week . 
  i suggest not wasting too much time to combat these trolls . 
  my guess is that these informational warfare operatives are constantly monitoring threads based on keywords in the titles . 
  it 's almost like this is their job or something . 
  crazy , i know !, 
  i hate to repeat myself , but i was writing about rumours that  fsru independence will be guarded what would mean  lithuanian ship sailing in a formation with an american missile destroyer . 
  now please stop trolling . 
  also , your remarks about lithuania being a country people do n't know about does n't put you in a flattering light . 
  do n't know if you 're serious . 
  however , the idea is that nobody would ever try to do anything even remotely stupid to a lithuanian ship sailing in a formation with an american [ missile destroyer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_ross_\\ ( ddg-71 \\ ) ) carrying a crew of 280 , also some other ships . 
  again , it 's only a rumour that i read on facebook . 
  it might sound crazy , but i think that you actually have a point . 
  there are some rumours that fsru independence will be guarded by ships of the us navy on the final leg of her journey to the baltic sea . 
  what happened two years ago ? 
   those things happened in many east european countries , such as lithuania . 
  what incident in lithuania are you referring to ? 
  it 's not that lithuania is a perfectly tolerant country , but i 'm not quite sure what you have in mind by saying ` those things ' . 
  do you know in which other country the international chocolate mafia is actively operating ? 
  what is the capital of belgium ? 
  brussels . 
  where are the headquarters of nato and the eu located ? 
  brussels . 
  mind . 
  exploded . 
  you forgot the illuminati and also ukrainian-swiss chocolate mafia . 
  this is not dumb , it is simply an evolutionary instinct for males ( and some females ) to resist an enemy invasion . 
  people will at least try to defend their homeland , even if the enemy is much stronger . 
  such behavior is programmed into our genes . 
  what makes you think so ? 
  ca n't speak about latvia and estonia . 
  but in lithuania the chain even had several superlong branches . 
  the longest of them was on kaunas-daugavpils highway , i think . 
  lots of participants were unable to reach the main route , there were simply too many people . 
   the dramatic drop in 2011 , when populations in kaunus , riga and vilnius fell by between 4 and 9 per cent , is likely due to the global financial crisis , which hit the baltic states harder than the rest of europe . 
  ca n't comment on latvia , but sharp drop in population figures in lithuania during those years was triggered not as much by a sudden increase in emigration , but by a new regulation which motivated lithuanians who were living and working abroad for quite some time to officially declare that they were not living in lithuania anymore . 
  by not declaring they were not living in lithuania , people would have been double-taxed for their healthcare . 
  in my opinion , this new regulation was an extremely good thing , as we were finally able to know the exact emigration figures . 
  correct spelling for the second-largest city of lithuania is kaunas , goddamnit . 
  yes , we used to have [ ignalina npp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignalina_nuclear_power_plant ) with reactors of the same type as ones in chernobyl . 
  the power plant is undergoing a long decommissioning process , which is part of the deal of our accession to the eu . 
  it used to provide up to 80 percent of electricity in lithuania , which meant that we used to be among world leaders in usage of nuclear power . 
  it is likely that a new [ visaginas npp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visaginas_nuclear_power_plant ) with a japanese reactor will be built at the same location in the next decade or so . 
  yeah , right . 
   they said the exact same thing ... all official speeches of us presidents are documented in written form . 
  give a link to such statement , or stop bothering me . 
  source ? 
  i think , if i were ukrainian , i would give an arm and a leg for the existence of such quote . 
  this . 
  while a situation of russian invasion into the baltics is very improbable , it is still better to be safe than sorry . 
  for this exact reason , we have hung this plaque on the wall of vilnius city hall : http://i.imgur.com/ekoshzu.jpg . 
  so we can point a finger to it if something very wrong happens . 
  there is absolutely no problem as long as gazprom obeys international trade law while asking particular countries to ` pay retail ' , whatever it may mean . 
  as i am not an expert on anti-competition law , i would feel more comfortable to wait until international court of arbitration settles current disputes . 
  if i may remind you , lithuania is asking $ 2 billion from gazprom as a compensation for unfair pricing . 
  besides simply being a business , gazprom is also an arm of the russian government . 
  which means that their pricing is suited to accomplish two things : to maximize profits , and to reinforce russian foreign policy . 
  the latter often being more important than the first . 
  i 'm not sure if you are joking or not , but that berlin pic is fake . 
  i think , the only real tall building in it is the tv tower . 
   holy shit , i never saw the first picture angle ? 
  where it 's taken from ? 
  i 'm not 100 percent sure , but it could very well be some upper floor room of holiday inn . 
  i like this skyline pic of vilnius a lot : http://i.imgur.com/udyszwv.jpg . 
  t-market brand was created by maxima group . 
  first they had a discount store chain called taupa . 
  it was later rebranded as t-market , and after that as saulut\u0117 . 
  finally , discount chain was closed and all stores reopened as maximas . 
  it seems , maxima group keeps using t-market brand in bulgaria . 
  brutalism still makes a lot sense to me , i do like it a lot and i often feel like a lonely soul in this regard . 
  but frankly speaking , our parliament is not a stellar example of brutalist architecture . 
  most sittings of the polish-lithuanian parliament took place in the houses of parliament which are located inside the [ royal castle of warsaw ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/warszawa-zamek_kr%c3%b3lewski.jpg/1024px-warszawa-zamek_kr%c3%b3lewski.jpg ) . 
  in lithuania we have a parliamentary ( seimas ) tradition from 1569 , but due to historical circumstances we have no ( old ) historic parliament building . 
  * between 1569-1795 we had a joint seimas/sejm of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth , which resided in warsaw . 
  * between 1795-1918 we were occupied by the tsardom of russia with no local parliament under operation . 
  * between 1919-1939 when vilnius was occupied by poland , the seimas operated from kaunas . 
  with some interruptions while we were experimenting with an authoritarian regime . 
  * in 1940 soviets established the supreme soviet of lithuanian ssr which acted as sort of a phony one-party parliament . 
  current bulding of the seimas was built in 1980 for the supreme council . 
  the building may not look very pretty to some , but it holds a very special place in the hearts of many lithuanians . 
  lithuanian state was reestablished there in 1990 . 
  in 1991 huge masses of people gathered around the building , ready to protect it with bare hands when ussr was using military force during its last seizures . 
  i actually like it a lot , and i do not think it sounds like a clich\u00e9 . 
  every word bears a meaning that is very strongly related to our modern values . 
  it does remind the french * libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 * though . 
  but * liberty , unity , prosperity * ( or * freedom , unity , well-being * ) is a spot on roadmap for 20th-21st century lithuania .
