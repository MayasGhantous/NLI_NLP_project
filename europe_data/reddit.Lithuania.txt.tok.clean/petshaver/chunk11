  * iceland used to be * very * expensive , now it is only * somewhat * expensive due to devaluation of the currency during the crisis . 
  seems like good reason to visit it finally , as i expect iceland to be something out of this world . 
  rubber ( pre-latex era ) condoms actually were reusable too . 
  and latex was * invented * only in 1920 . 
  sorry , but this is an overgeneralisation . 
  situation is different on a per country basis . 
  you probably have customs union ( and ultimately eurasian union ) in mind . 
  ukraine has been a de facto member of cis since 1991 . 
  while i agree with your general idea that ukraine is doing the right thing by integrating into europe , i do n't think it 's realistic for ukraine to ever become free of russian influence . 
  these countries have always been interconnected in many ways . 
  if ukraine eventually becomes a member of eu , russian influence will become weaker , no questions about it . 
  but i would n't expect russians to lose all leverages they have . 
  i expect them to try to use their financial and political resources in ukraine to the max for many years to come . 
  montenegrin trains are classy as fuck ... in 007 casino royale . 
  [ i love this scene so much . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5c7lmowyyc ) it was actually shot on a czech railways train . 
  mostly by extensions of territorial waters , and also by exploration history , i suppose . 
  here 's the list for ** ` most evil and egoistic governments on our planet ' ** , as based on territorial claims in [ the arctic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_claims_in_the_arctic ) and [ antarctica ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_claims_in_antarctica ) : * argentina * australia * canada * chile * denmark * france * norway * russia * uk * usa, 
  upvote for vanishing waves . 
  i 'm glad that we finally acquired capabilities to produce a decent sci-fi flick . 
  lithuanian filmmakers have yet to break out abroad , most they usually get is some limited screenings in festivals . 
  however , first lithuanian movie , intended for wide international distribution , is currently in production and features a british-lithuanian cast . 
  it 's due to be out next year , but a trailer has been released already . 
  at least to me it looks like some strange hybrid of ritchie , tarantino and kusturica films . 
  i hope , it turns out good . 
  check it out : [ ** redirected ** \\ ( 2014 \\ ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inkmg9cckqw ) . 
  it would be just fabulous if putin met westerwelle on some occasion . 
  lukashenko has once directly suggested him to lead a more normal life during a meeting , wonder if putin could top that . 
  without making any further assumptions on who might be responsible for the attack , i would like to point out that the victim was not caught in the crossfire . 
  attack was carried out on two marked eulex vehicles from an ambush . 
  it was condemned as a cowardly act of violence both by belgrade and pristina . 
  it 's quite clear , that a purely criminal nature of the assault can be ruled out . 
  in my opinion , that statement would n't make any sense at all , even if it was accurate and not derogatory . 
  forgive my uneducated guess , but is n't it * more likely * that the crime was commited by ethinc serbs ? 
  assault happened in mitrovica area and , as i understand , serbs have more reasons to be displeased with eulex forces administering kosovo border . 
  well , any figures that are given before enough exploration wells are drilled , are simply guesstimates . 
  even after commercial drilling starts , there can be huge drops in output . 
  that 's why i would take any numbers with a grain of salt , as commercial production has not even started in europe . 
  that being said , energy companies know that with great risk comes great reward . 
  conocophilips has started extraction a few weeks ago . 
  it 's not on a commercially viable scale yet , but still it 's the first such operation in europe . 
  it 's true however , that initial estimations of huge reserves are proving to be overly optimistic . 
  lithuanian media has confirmed that the victim is 35 y/o customs officer from klaipeda , lithuania . 
  time has come for a reggae-flavoured nordic cross . 
  lifeboat dilemma is a choice between morality and self gain , so it does n't apply here . 
  while trying to pull post-soviet states into european sphere of influence might be ` moral ' in a sense , real reason is different . 
  what baltics are doing here , is trying to stop russia from creating an important power centre on the world arena once again , as it is a matter of security for the baltic states themselves . 
  that 's right , it 's called bad kerning . 
   could you expend on what 's actually restricted . 
  all of lithuanian trucks , or trucks carrying lithuanian goods , are being held for extra lengthy checks at the customs . 
  now it got to the point , that trucks currently at the border have been there since thursday morning , that means the checks are taking more than 5 days . 
  among other stuff , lithuania exports quite a lot of food to russia , mostly dairy products . 
  lithuanian businesses are experiencing millions worth of losses every day . 
  popular explanation is punishment for lithuanian involvement in european integration of ukraine and moldova . 
  also , there are * speculations * that it 's being done to force lithuania into long-term russian gas deal . 
  russia has yet to provide their reasoning . 
  it 's been on lithuanian media since last week . 
  today shit has hit the fan , as eu is involving , and [ story is starting to be run at last ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/17/us-lithuania-russia-idusbre98g0xy20130917 ) . 
  [ that picture ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2013/09/blogs/prospero/20130921_bkp504.jpg ) from the article is seriously bugging me . 
  why did they have to choose a completely different sans-serif font for the greek signboard of the ep ? 
  a different alphabet is not an excuse . 
  wonder how the bulgarian one looks like . 
  ** lithuania ** under current lithuanian law , bilingual * street ( address ) * signs are not allowed at all . 
  however , in some municipalities with significant polish minority , there are quite many bilingual makeshift street signs . 
  these are often made by residents , and are in fact illegal . 
  new laws are currently under preparation . 
  it 's likely that such street signs will be allowed where at least ** 25 % ** of population belongs to a certain national minority . 
  it 's a different matter for signboards that are located next to entrances to municipalities and other government institutions ( i mean a different thing than street signs here ) . 
  these are bilingual in areas with significant minorities . 
  as far as i know , it 's for the institution to decide if a bilingual signboard is needed . 
  all i want to say is that i am simply raising eyebrows here , as all what i see is a biased wikipedia article complaining about biased wikipedia articles . 
  not good if croatian wiki editors are biased against minorities , or if their nationalism is preventing from being objective . 
  however , while i 'm not really familiar with situation , my guess is that 's just one side of the story . 
  just look at this sentence from the linked article :  the issue was reported by croatia 's daily jutarnji list and even made its print edition front page on 11 september 2013 . 
  that 's far from encyclopedia worthy material . 
  that 's simply opinionated writing of someone not familiar with how one should objectively present facts on wikipedia . 
  just look at this : ' ... and * even * made it ... ' . 
  that 's simply a flamewar , and i do n't have time to try to find out which side is right in this particular case . 
  comments are forbidden for this post . 
  that 's a nice approach to have that card with consolidated identification capabilities for online use , but other countries , especially in our region , are not exactly backwards . 
  i remember that during my visit to helsinki around 10 years ago , paying via sms for public transport was already widespread among locals . 
  i think , that qualified as an electronic ticket even then . 
  we do n't have such card in lithuania , but government institutions use gateways of online banking systems to check identification . 
  that means that the most popular way to login is to use passwords of one of several larger private bank systems . 
  if it 's some simple service with no possible threat to privacy , such as booking a doctor appointment , usually just a personal id number is enough . 
  nothing to kill or die for and no religion too ( j.l. ), 
  no need to downvote this . 
  it 's true that romans were first , but their constitution was not similar to anything we have today . 
  poland-lithuania had the first codified constitution of modern europe . 
  it was second in the world of its kind , as it came into effect just three years after the us constitution . 
  both of them were not dissimilar , as they were a product of the age of enlightenment . 
  edit : just noticed that / u/tepuiner already mentioned most of what i had to say . 
   the views of lech poznan pseudo supporters are most definitely not representative of general populaion 's views . 
  absolutely agree . 
  it 's no secret , that some groups of die-hard football fans overlap with right-wing extremist gangs . 
  i was following this recent scandal quite closely and while it managed to cause a stir in the media ( especially in poland ) , general population hold totally different views on these matters . 
  furthermore , there were even informal acts of showing good intentions on [ social media ] ( https://www.facebook.com/pages/lithuania-loves-poland/546543435412183 ) and elsewhere , [ such as these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dek0768.jpg ) , to ridicule those poor skinhead schmucks and play down the tensions . 
  oh yes , we could have become a single nation . 
  this is a historical what if of colossal proportion to both lithuania and latvia . 
  there was no exploitation from either side , union was not enforced , and mostly beneficial for both parties .
