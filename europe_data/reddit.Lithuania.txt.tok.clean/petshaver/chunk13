  however , it seems that it 's not that simple , as businessmen are complaining about the level of corruption and also organised crime . 
  they say that in this respect bulgaria is similar to 1990s lithuania . 
  i 'm absolutely sure , that this situation is temporary , but you better be quick to deal with it . 
  * there is a very special connection between lithuania and bulgaria . 
  arguably , the most famous lithuanian of late 19th and early 20th century was jonas basanavicius ( [ this guy ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/50_litai_%282003%29.jpg ) ) . 
  he was more or less the leader of the lithuanian national revival movement , that makes him directly responsible for lithuanian independence . 
  so , mr basanavicius actually spent many years in coastal bulgarian city of varna . 
  he held a bulgarian citizenship and was also elected to the city council . 
  * lastly , * varna * means ` crow ' in lithuania ( lithuanian * varna * is related to slavic * vorona * , by the way ) , that makes it a very funny name for a city . 
  i 'm pretty sure that paris has excellent chances . 
  paris lost bids to barcelona , shanghai * and very narrowly to london . 
  the last bid was extremely well prepared , and it 's been stated that they 'd like to try once again for the 2024 games . 
  edit : * beijing , the games were in beijing , goddammit . 
  i was not clear enough to write that spanish/castilian is ( usually ) not your mother tongue , therefore you are absolutely right , 
  because this particular article is a piece of news about madrid . 
  i see various flairs representing regions , unrecognised countries , historical states and other strange entities over here . 
  i believe that you are absolutely free to ask the mods for some specific flag to be added , if you do n't find one you can identify with . 
  edit : / u/perropirata was quicker . 
  glad that we absolutely agree . 
  why the downvotes ? 
  catalan issues aside , barcelona and madrid were and * still are * in the same state . 
  28 years is a quite short time span for an olympic cycle , so i do see a point here . 
  on a completely different note , i believe that barcelona olympics had a huge impact on general knowledge about catalonia . 
  millions and millions of people found out that there are these proud catalan people who actually do n't speak spanish ( gasp ) . 
  edit : by * do n't speak spanish * i obviously mean * do n't use spanish as the main language * . 
  it 's about time . 
  not many europeans know this , but it 's a well known fact in lithuania , as the [ largest retailer in the baltics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maxima_group ) is largely run via its dutch subsidiaries while being a lithuanian company . 
  oh shit , looks like you 're right . 
  so you 're telling , let 's just scrape off everything ? 
  no more free movement of people , capital and goods ? 
  perhaps , we might as well stop free trade with switzerland and also reintroduce border controls between all countries ? 
  let 's just let our laws become incompatible and then start everything over again . 
  yeah , this * eu 2.0 * would surely be much better , as the original union was anything but a disaster . 
  / sarcasm edit : i have probably misunderstood parent comment , thinking that it suggests all european integration should be reversed . 
  / u/aega100 , could you clarify , please ? 
  the swiss moved from confederation to federation in 1848 with [ swiss federal constitution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_federal_constitution ) . 
  swiss confederation is just an official name , which has been left unchanged . 
  * democracy is a political system where citizens * participate in the law making process * , mostly by representation via elected individuals . 
  it does not mean that any groups of people can do whatever they like if they decide so . 
  * you are mentioning self-determination . 
  this principle states that nations * or * peoples are free to choose their sovereignty , ` peoples ' meaning population of the entire non self-governing territorial unit . 
  that means that popular opinion of a single county would mean nothing according to international law . 
  * in * some * other cases , question of defining ` unit size ' for self-governing is more valid . 
  for example , not only french-speaking canadians live in vast territories of quebec . 
  the cree , who oppose quebec sovereignty movement , argue that if quebec has the right to leave canada then the cree people have the right to choose to keep their territory in canada . 
  back in the day there were european companies , such as olivetti ( italy ) , or bull ( france ) that produced quite a lot of computers and other electronics in europe . 
  but they were not quick enough to move their production to asia , when it became economically sound to do it . 
  asia won this race because of their successful investment to research and development and lower production cost because of relatively low wages . 
  american computer manufacturers were quicker to realise the situation . 
  they actually produce ( and often design ) most of their stuff in asia now . 
  some of american producers chose to sell out , just like packard bell . 
  for example ibm sold their notebook business to chinese manufacturer lenovo . 
  cue shoe bang . 
  ** [ streisand effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect ) ** : the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide , remove , or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely , usually facilitated by the internet . 
  named after american entertainer barbra streisand . 
  `` it 's a nice little country you have . 
  it would be a shame if anything happened to it ... '' yeah , i 'm exaggerating here a bit . 
  but i actually find this kind of diplomatic tone very funny . 
  i 'm going to hell for this ... 
   the countries in question will usually try to spin this in way that russia threatens them russian deputy pm rogozin on his recent address to moldovan government : [ `` energy supplies are important in the run-up to winter . 
  i hope you wo n't freeze . 
  '' ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/03/us-moldova-russia-idusbre9820vi20130903 ) if this is not a threat , i do n't know what is . 
  it 's not the first time , that i read speculations about zhirinovsky being temperate and reserved person , and doing his political stuff in a carefully planned manner . 
  according to that rumour , it 's not actually a conspiracy by the ruling elite , but a successful act of his own . 
  while it 's an interesting theory , i doubt if it holds much truth . 
  however , i do agree that he is n't doing much harm to kremlin , furthermore , sometimes he might be useful for the ruling party . 
  well , that went not as expected . 
  your team was clearly better tonight . 
  in other news , [ yerevan says association agreement with eu still possible ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/armenia-eu-customs-union/25095145.html ) . 
  or , to put it another way , armenian president says it 's possible to ride two horses at once ... 
  it will probably end up another frozen territorial conflict like northern cyprus . 
  russian deputy pm rogozin :  energy supplies are important in the run-up to winter . 
  i hope you wo n't freeze . 
  haha , that sounds like some mean shit a james bond movie villain would say . 
  what 's it about ? 
  well , that 's true that they have a few serious problems , such as poor political stability , lousy economics and transnistria . 
  however , 20 years is a bit too much , in my opinion 10 would be closer to the truth . 
  that being said , i 'll believe it 's happening only when it will be clearly stated that they will sign the association agreement with the eu . 
  i suspect that russians still might have something up their sleeves . 
  there 's [ plenty of coverage ] ( https://news.google.com/news/story?pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=croatian+cyrillic&amp;ncl=drvxe0utujsv1omvqgpybg8vq3_cm&amp;cf=all ) . 
  so , after ukraine chose to side with eu , and armenia with russia , it only leaves moldova 's future yet to be decided . 
  scramble for europe soon will be over . 
  swedish thrillers are really popular all over the world , including lithuania . 
  it means that either lithuanian publishers are buying into the hype created by american publishing industry , or the swedish are exceptionally good with their thrillers . 
  my bet is on the second option . 
  also , there is jonas jonasson with his [ hugely successful bestseller ] ( http://www.amazon.com/100-year-old-man-climbed-window-disappeared/dp/1401324649/ ) , which is not a thriller at all . 
  my point is that if a book is really great , and if foreign people might find it interesting and/or relevant , most likely it will get translated and * successfully * published abroad . 
  it is hard to hide a true gem . 
  as for * the witcher * , i 've heard that it 's very popular in poland . 
  but english books failed to become a success , so i do n't see a point here . 
  i know jackshit about hungarian literature , so i might come off as ignorant or rude . 
  also , by all means it 's subjective what * very good fiction * is . 
  however , do n't you think there 's a reason why these books are not getting translated to other languages ? 
  no , we do n't , and it 's a shame . 
  while there definitely are good books that might interest * some * people , there are no works of lithuanian literature that received serious interest abroad . 
  the closest you can get is [ between shades of gray ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/between_shades_of_gray ) , ( not to be confused with '50 shades of gray ' , heh ) . 
  it 's a teen bestseller which is about lithuania and lithuanians , as the author is lithuanian-american . 
  novel was a huge hit a couple of years ago , so perhaps it 's worth a mention , but it 's still a piece of teenager literature . 
  that being said , i really wish someone wrote a first true lithuanian bestseller . 
  you got a couple of things wrong with [ that lithuanian offer ] ( http://meganet.lt/internetas/sviesolaidinis-internetas/planai/ ) : * this is a promotional price , not a regular one .
