  * 300/100 mbps is not download/upload speed , but bandwidth for lithuanian/international traffic nevertheless , isps are doing great job in lithuania , fiber is available in most places , and prices are low , indeed .

   the house of the blackheads eew . 
   now , more than two decades after the berlin wall fell , that identity is rapidly disappearing . 
  east germany is almost completely gone . 
  good . 
  you 've missed charlie . 
  i think , i 'm done with this lunacy . 
  i kindly suggest you to move the discussion of possible involvement of armed lithuanian freedom fighters in january events to / r/conspiracy . 
   do the russians have one definition of power ? 
  it seems this always means in a military sense . 
  having power means having influence abroad and being stable enough within its borders . 
  strong military force is an important , but by no means the only factor . 
  so , i agree . 
   you ca n't question the party line , mmmmkay ? 
  read first paragraphs of my previous reply once again , please . 
  i hate to be redundant . 
   it would be amazing if you could question the best friend of the west - mr.gorby about those events in vilnius gorby is not a good pal of lithuania , as opposed to elsewhere in the west , particularly because of the january events . 
   it would be a bit embarassing if it turns out that they were killed by the same freedom fighters . 
  ooops ... 
  i 'd like to help you to present your inconvenient questions in a clear non-trolling manner . 
  i will also provide unbiased answers : ** q : ** is there proof that soviet army killed civilians ? 
  ** a : ** yes . 
  events were well documented and witnessed by numerous foreign reporters . 
  ** q : ** is it possible , that some victims were killed by lithuanian freedom fighters ? 
  ** a : ** no . 
  there was no such thing as armed freedom fighters at the events . 
  the main principle of the singing revolution was peaceful resistance . 
  ** q : ** could one get in legal trouble in lithuania by stating that soviets did not kill people during the january events ? 
  ** a : ** yes , it would be punishable by law . 
  ** q : ** is that fair ? 
  does n't it infringe freedom of speech ? 
  ** a : ** there are [ different opinions on similar matters ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial#overview_and_commentary ) . 
   it seems like russia is just settling at its natural state . 
  this kind of stance seems to be where russia feels most comfortable . 
  i do n't really think it 's easy to tell what this * natural state * of russia is . 
  i think , russia is still in transitional phase of searching for its identity and ` true form ' . 
  one thing for sure , russia wants be powerful . 
  also , economic prosperity would be nice . 
  other features are still quite in the dark . 
   i do n't see any discussion here around prosecuting the person who dare to question the party line . 
  you provided links to three articles , do n't expect discussion on every single point . 
  yet , if you 're interested in comments on mr paleckis trial , i 'll be glad to share some insights . 
  to begin with , let me correct you that he was n't exactly * questioning the party line * , whatever ` party line ' may mean in a multi-party state . 
  according to lithuanian law , public denial of nazi and soviet crimes against residents of lithuania is forbidden . 
  as you know , paleckis was sentenced to pay fine of $ 3,000 for stating that it was not soviet army , but secret lithuanian snipers who were responsible for civilian deaths during the [ vilnius massacre in 1991 ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4059000/4059959.stm ) . 
  this law is similar to [ laws against holocaust denial ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial ) , which are effective in 17 european states . 
  in lithuania , besides nazi crimes , it also covers soviet attrocities . 
  such laws regarding repressive regimes are not uncommon , for example there are several countries , where denial of armenian genocide is forbidden . 
  by the way , i agree that there is no definitive answer if such laws are justifiable . 
  is it ok , that i can tell whatever lies i want , * except some * certain lies ? 
  i 'm going to refrain from digging into this , as it would be a very broad and lengthy discussion . 
  and frankly , i 'm not sure i know the answer . 
  however , i must set one more thing straight . 
  mr paleckis is far from a respectable journalist/politician/diplomat , in contrast with what your article says . 
  he 's a leader of an extreme far-left movement and his reputation is extremely dubious . 
  all parliamentarian parties ( both right - and left - wing ) try to stay as far from him as possible . 
  paleckis comes from an influential political dynasty , however his father , an european mp , and his brother , a journalist , were forced to distance themselves from him . 
  this case also seems to have spoiled their family relationship . 
  edit : grammar, 
  let me try to comment on that quote as objectively as i can :  the courts rehabilitate swastika and lithuania for the lithuanians kind of slogans . 
  nazi insignia , swastika included , is forbidden by law in lithuania . 
  the article is referring to a court decision in 2010 , when a group of neo-nazis were accused of displaying a banner with a swastika-like ` mythological/historical ' symbol . 
  the court determined that a picture of a 13th century lithuanian engraving was used , meaning that the symbol can not be considered a nazi swastika . 
  so , it 's quite clear that neo-nazis managed to circumvent the law . 
  court decision stirred a lot of discussion and was especially heavily criticised by left-wing groups . 
  afaik , after that there were no more attempts to publicly display swastikas in demonstrations . 
   yearly the self-government authorities permit nazi marches to mark major state holidays . 
  neo-nazi that serve in the armed forces are proud to take part in them . 
  discrimination on ethnic basis and hate speech are forbidden by law . 
  however , the right of peaceful meetings is guaranteed by the constitution . 
  this creates a situation , similar to one in other western democracies , where far-right groups have freedom to freely walk down the street in an organised manner , however they must refrain from hate speech . 
  unfortunately , it 's not always the case . 
  neo-nazi groups usually try to use public demonstrations taking place on the day of restoration of independence in main cities to pursue their agenda . 
  on several occasions , situation got out of hand , most serious case was in 2008 . 
  that year court prosecuted skinheads for displaying swastikas in the centre of vilnius and chanting things like ` lithuania without russians ' , ` down with jews ' , etc. 
  the current situation is that this annual demonstration attracts a lot of public attention , as people are interested if the skinheads are going ` to cross the line this time ' . 
  there are also people who are supportive of ` patriotic youth celebrating the independence , as long as they behave ' . 
  as for members of armed forces taking part in demonstrations , there have been a couple publicly known instances of such things . 
  obviously , soldiers did n't participate while dressed in uniforms . 
  the armed forces have stated they condemn these actions . 
   regularly the graves of soviet soldiers and holocaust victims are desecrated . 
  every year the hitler 's birthday is marked with nazi flags and signs . 
  nobody has ever been brought to justice for such actions ... '' such things really happen every year on hitler 's birthday in several places in largest cities . 
  usually neo-nazis hang a flag or paint graffiti on bridges , walls , abandoned buildings . 
  most disturbing case was a couple of years ago when a severed pig 's head was found in a jewish cemetery in kaunas . 
  all these flags and graffiti ( and in that particular case , a pig 's head ) are swiftly removed . 
  general opinion is extremely negative towards such things . 
  police start investigations , but i do n't remember anyone being arrested or fined . 
  to be honest , i do n't think that 's an easy task , as it 's quite easy to commit such crime uncaught . 
  as for desecrating graves of soviet soldiers , while i 'm not saying it ca n't be true , i do n't know anything about it and i 'd be happy to be provided with references . 
  in general , these graves are taken care of by the state , as far as i know , their condition is way better than in russia . 
  now it 's up to you to make conclusions about any bias that article may ( or may not ) have . 
  do n't think so . 
  most likely , the person who wrote the captions does n't know how foundation of a postcommie style apartment building is supposed to look like . 
  check picture # 9 :  a teenage roma girl is sitting on a balcony of one of lunik ix 's abandoned flats . 
  the garbage thrown out of the window has already reached the first floor . 
  girl is obviously sitting in a balcony of the ground floor , it 's not the first floor . 
  there is only a feet or two of garbage on the ground , it has n't ` reached ' anything ... yet . 
  nevertheless , that shit looks nasty , and the smell must be just wonderful .
