  it 's there , at the bottom of the first picture . 
  as if this alone was n't delirious enough , mr alexandrov is also suggesting that :  before the crisis , russia should withdraw from the nuclear test ban treaty and to conduct demonstrative nuclear explosion in the new earth . 
  this will show the west the seriousness of our intentions and willingness , if necessary , to use nuclear weapons . 
  [ note : poor translation , * new earth * actually means [ novaya zemlya ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novaya_zemlya ) ] it 's obvious that all these talks are plain crazy and should n't be treated seriously , however , media in the baltics was quick to catch it . 
  and it 's not surprising at all , as he 's not a random person , the guy is representing a serious think tank , which was [ founded by official russian institutions ] ( http://www.materik.ru/institute/about/ ) ( link in russian ) . 
  what the fuck ? 
   roma kids play in the back of one of lunik ix 's apartment buildings next to a several meter thick layer of garbage . 
  sensationalist media distorting facts , as usual . 
  that ditch obviously * is not * several meters deep . 
  maybe a feet or so of garbage , not a biggie . 
  sarcasm aside , it was an extremely bad idea to concentrate all those people in a single block . 
  i 'm not saying the government is responsible of the pathetic state of that community , but now this ghetto is a bomb waiting to explode . 
  it probably would be a good idea to try to relocate these people in smaller groups and to demolish the buildings . 
  * moldovans have been using cyrillic alphabet under russian/soviet rule . 
  latin alphabet has been reintroduced after independence . 
  also , country 's name has been changed from moldavia to moldova . 
  * state language is moldovan , as stated in the constitution , but it 's officially called romanian in the school curriculum . 
  of course , it 's the same language . 
  * was very famous for its wine in the entire ussr !, 
  true . 
  however , my point was n't that usa would n't serve as a suitable model for federal governance . 
  my point was that there are a lot of europeans who [ do n't think fondly of usa ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1kzvlv/we_eurozoners_must_create_a_united_state_of_europe/cbudju7 ) . 
  therefore , it would be wise not to throw the term * united states of europe * around too much , because it often causes a knee-jerk reaction . 
   that is surprising news . 
  in fact , this has been brewing for some time already . 
  the article mentions an association agreement about to be signed by eu and ukraine in november . 
  well , it has been in preparation for a while now . 
  it 's just only during past few weeks they started giving some real indications that they are signing it . 
  today 's speech by yanukovich makes it quite clear that ukraine is clearly stating she 's ready for the fourth base . 
  looks like russia is about to enter economic recession . 
  this might be * one * of the reasons . 
  yes , very much so . 
  however , you have to be prepared for constant flamewars between pro-western and pro-russian camps . 
  the swiss federation has worked , because the center has been respectful of the autonomy of the cantons ( which were never anxious to hand over their authority ) and careful not to abuse its powers . 
  all powers not specifically delegated to the federal government by the swiss constitution , moreover , continue to be held by the cantons . 
  ( as told by former swiss diplomat jakob kellenberger ), 
  the article also states that ` since then , two new eu member states have been accepted in the forms of romania and bulgaria . ', 
  they 've missed poor croats , although their accession is mentioned in other section of the article . 
  somebody 's done a poor job . 
  reported the mistakes , hope someone will correct that . 
   armenia joining is such a far-away prospect that it 's barely worth talking about at this moment . 
  actually , a high level chess game is currently being played between eu and russia in determining their influence in the future of europe . 
  there are at least three countries , that are balancing on the edge and now is a good time both for russia and for eu to try to pull them to their sides . 
  most important piece in this game is ukraine , with other two being armenia and moldova . 
  as russia is entering economic recession , and europe is climbing out of it , these three countries are very tempted to declare intentions of european integration , even if the membership would a very long-term goal . 
  it 's much wiser to use switzerland as an example when pitching federalization of eu , as lots of europeans have a knee-jerk reaction for anything usa . 
  it 's mostly a matter of relativity : the good guy ( usa ) does n't look that well , when the bad guy ( ussr ) is not around anymore . 
  also , switzerland is really relevant , as they have managed to create a successful union of different cultures and religions . 
  this is a very nice article on the matter : [ the next europe - toward a federal union ] ( http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139461/nicolas-berggruen-and-nathan-gardels/the-next-europe?page=show ) . 
   ha-ha . 
  yes . 
  i 've driven on these roads that are basically like train tracks . 
  [ i know what you mean ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jiwpccg.jpg ), 
  [ here 's a current map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s3cbvsv.jpg ) of pavement conditions on polish roads . 
  and [ this is your itinerary ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/5d0vd ) of the polish leg of your trip ( according to google maps ) . 
  while you 're right that there are many bad roads in poland , * most * of them are in good condition , and * this * was my point . 
  please also have in mind that you were driving almost exclusively on local roads , and not using international trunk routes while travelling through poland . 
  lithuania still holds the position as region 's leader in terms of road quality and network efficiency . 
  however , if poland continues investment to their infrastructure on such a tremendous scale , we will be overtaken in a decade or so . 
  and you do n't even want to know how bad the situation was in poland 10-15 years ago . 
  your picture is quite interesting by the way , because this is a nice example of a historical cobblestone road , and it looks like it has been taken care of . 
  we also have some short sections like this on secondary roads in lithuania , provided that there are alternative routes in area , or the road connects nothing else besides some small village . 
  the reason for this is that these roads actually have heritage value , as most of them were built more than a century ago , in times of the occupation of tsarist russia . 
  never heard anyone saying such thing . 
  on the contrary , people have complained about terrible pavement quality and high traffic intensity on polish roads for years . 
  and [ this road sign ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:znak_t-13.svg ) * ( koleiny ) * is notoriously familiar to lithuanian drivers . 
  fortunately , the situation has changed drastically during past several years . 
  nowadays , most polish roads are absolutely ok , and the new motorways are among the best in europe . 
  edit : grammar, 
  if anyone 's curious why basketball makes such huge part of lithuanian identity , i recommend watching [ the other dream team ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606829/ ) , one of the best sports documentaries of recent years ( 7.7 on imdb ) . 
  it 's actually a story about the concept of freedom ( both in personal and national sense of the word ) , as much as it is about sports . 
  this is probably the reason the movie was so succesfull . 
  i 'm glad this film was produced in usa and caters to an american audience , as the result is very watchable , there is a good dose of tongue in cheek humour , and no * lithuania big * awkwardness . 
  trailer : http://youtu.be/pdukslazyje the movie is currently trending on netflix , but most of us do n't have it in our countries . 
  luckily , full version is currrently also on youtube , although i expect it to be taken down sooner or later : http://youtu.be/odbv9c01daa ( edit : it seems that this version is ripped from a lithuanian release , so the interview parts are untranslated . 
  i kindly suggest to use your favourite torrent search engine if you do n't feel like buying the movie . 
  or just buy it , for heaven 's sake . 
  i also think it 's up for rent on itunes . ), 
  baseball is the most popular sport in puerto rico ( assuming you can call it a country ) . 
  however , basketball is the most popular sport in the philippines . 
  afaik , the only such case besides lithuania . 
  wow , that 's interesting . 
  it 's the same everywhere , / u/koleye has corrected his/her post . 
  actually , the partition of poland-lithuania took place in 1772-1795 , so you 're off by a century . 
  everything else is correct . 
  cheers !, 
  sounds quite right !, 
  let 's hope that poles do just like you say ... and that you do n't happen to be wrong , 
   but never in that reply did i saw that any of those points are caused by the video we 're discussing . 
  it 's like you just have some thoughts about rt , but the video does n't prove any of your points . 
  that 's right , we 're having quite broad discussion about rt here . 
  i was the one to point to the censorship issue which actually * was * what the reporter spoke about . 
  and on my second reply i elaborated more on this issue , as i believed you were asking me to . 
   additionally you 're from lithuania , so together with my previous point it leads me into believing that you 're biased against russia , would that be reasonable ? 
  no , such assumption would be incorrect . 
  it would be far from truth to call me admirer of mr putin 's policies though . 
  currently there are no strong opposition figures in russia for a proper comparison , but would you say that e.g. 
  garry kasparov is biased against russia ? 
  i hold similar views on many things , in a sense that i admire governments that are able to secure human rights , the rule of law , democratic elections and transfer of power , also division of powers besides other important things . 
  i could go on , but that 's a very wide topic .
