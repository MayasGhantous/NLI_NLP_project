  much less egalitarian than french motto , much more similar to the good old american dream . 
  very rational , yet also spiritual and uplifting . 
  could n't think anything better for putting on money . 
  i think , lithuanian bank did a great job by choosing this phrase . 
  this is roughly the same number as the notoriously overblown budget of sochi olympics . 
  in other words , an insane amount of money . 
  i do not think that it will create problems . 
  we had mandatory ethnicity records in documents during soviet times , and it did not create any tensions or anything like that . 
  but i do agree that this is a bad idea . 
  the whole concept is not relevant in our times . 
  we should not base nationality on ethnicity . 
  why taint ? 
  we also have a classic rivalry between two largest cities . 
  a lot of people from vilnius look down on people from kaunas . 
  and vice versa , lots of kaunians look down on vilnians . 
  latin * homo * is a pretty straightforward derivative from a proto-indo-european word for earthling/human . 
  it is one of the essential words that can be traced all the way back to proto-indo-european hypothetical * d\u02b0\u00e9\u01f5\u02b0\u014dm * ( accusative : * \u01f5\u02b0em-m \u0325 * ) . 
  it found its way to latin * ( humus ) * , persian * ( zami ) * and many [ other languages ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:proto-indo-european/d%ca%b0%c3%a9%c7%b5%ca%b0%c5%8dm ) . 
  it is also related to latin * homo * , english * human * , etc. 
  well , borowitz report * is * a satire column ... 
  it is viewed that euro may be beneficial in boosting foreign investment . 
  one of the positive effects would be assuring investors that the risk of unpegging litas and devaluating their assets equals zero . 
  actually , [ fitch has upgraded lithuanian credit rating ] ( http://online.wsj.com/articles/fitch-upgrades-lithuania-on-planned-euro-adoption-1403729155 ) this week citing the eu 's decision to let lithuania have euro :  `` it will reduce credit risks associated with foreign currency exposures on the sovereign 's balance sheet and in the banking system , as well the country 's still high level of net external debt . '', 
  also , economic and political integration into the core of europe is being viewed as a mean of minimizing threats to national security . 
  no government institutions will close in relation to euro adoption . 
  bank of lithuania will keep working . 
  they actually will have more power now , as they will be able to participate in decisions of european monetary policy . 
  * strong approval : 11 percent * moderate approval : 29 percent * disapproval : 40 percent * undecided : 20 percent typical person who strongly approves accession of euro is a 23-35 y/o city resident who mostly uses electronic means of payment . 
  people who disapprove the euro tend to be residents of rural areas who mostly handle cash and are younger than 22 or older than 60 . 
  data is from february by swedbank/tns lt. 
  ** lithuania ** * lithuania gets eu 's final approval for euro accession from january 1st . 
  * the supreme court of lithuania rules that lithuanian art museum must return 2 paintings worth $ 580k to germany . 
  they have disappeared from berlin and potsdam during ww2 . 
  * lithuanian president likens territorial expansion tactics of putin to stalin 's and hitler 's . 
  this sparks a significant russian reaction . 
  * referendum on extending ban of sale of agricultural land to foreigners is taking place ( on sunday ) . 
  turnout is very low which means that the ban will be lifted . 
  russia does not oppose france for building their warships despite opposition from other nato countries , you know ... 
  dear estonians , calm down . 
  sneaky fingers only made an innocent joke !, 
  downvoting it looks kinda butthurtish . 
  both are correct . 
  vlad is a shortened form of the name , while vova is a diminutive . 
  vladimir-vlad-vova would roughly correspond to , say , leonard-leon-lenny . 
  ** fetish ** * ( noun ) * * ** feti\u0161as ** * ( lithuanian ) * * ** feti\u0161s ** * ( latvian ) * * ** kinnism\u00f5te ** * ( estonian ) * guess who 's got the strangest fetish . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  i hear you . 
  however , workforce with lower skills and lower pay are contributors in a healthy economy in terms of both gdp * and * gdp per capita . 
  57 per cent of residents are not producing anything in lithuania . 
  these are children , the unemployed , students , elderdly people and the ones unable to work . 
  this means that the remaining 43 per cent have to produce all stuff . 
  another thing is that it is no longer true that people who leave are the ones who ca n't find a decent job . 
  there are plenty of decent jobs and lots of people go abroad simply because of cultural reasons or because they are hungry for opportunities , not because of poverty or anything like that . 
   less people , as much capital . 
  sorry , but this is incorrect in economical terms . 
  and i 'm not really familiar with the * capital per laborer * indicator . 
  hello , 2014 calling . 
  numbers of people leaving the country and coming to it have almost equalized . 
   if even more people emigrate , it will increase even more , hurray !, 
  do you want to say that if most of the workforce leaves , the remaining people will generate more produce per person ? 
  this is not how economics work . 
  [ empti - saloje ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbfnlvcrayi ) ( * on an island * ) , a quintessential lithuanian summer track from 1999 . 
  yes , these are results after a run-off . 
  it would be considered a landslide victory in many other countries , where two candidates are competing for two major parties . 
  however , lithuania has a multi-party system with some candidates often running ( and winning ) independently . 
  two rounds are usually needed and fluctuations in public opinion are much larger . 
  by lithuanian standards this victory is ` convincing ' . 
  landslide would be something like 70-30 . 
  the turnout was 47.31 % . 
  that 's not far from an average election in lithuania . 
  well , you are not too far from being correct . 
  the runner-up indeed often demonstrated a certain * do n't give a fuck * attitude . 
  yet ... grybauskaite was seen as a strong favourite , but not as an obvious winner . 
  her final result of 58 percent against her opponent 's 40 percent is far from being a landslide victory . 
  this kind of electoral split does leave some room for hopes and surprises . 
  i would disagree that the runner-up did not want to win . 
  he did a lot of work to consolidate voters whose preferred candidates dropped out after the first round . 
  he was also a lot more agressive before the run-off than he was before the first round . 
  that 's right . 
  in political , social and military contexts russian term * provokatsiya * indeed has a bit more narrow meaning than english * provocation * . 
   * provokatsiya * simply means taking control of your enemies in secret and encouraging them to do things that discredit them and help you .

  i 'm a dog . 
  i do understand that our military is tiny in comparison with the uk . 
  but would you care to elaborate why we are shitty allies ? 
  ** lithuania ** * the us deploy 150 paratroopers to lithuania in response to the situation in ukraine * a large forest fire destroys up to 1 sq km of seaside forest in the curonian spit national park * over 200 thousand participate in an annual outdoor cleanup campaign on saturday, 
  / r/europics, 
   could it be expected that lithuania will soon be on the lookout for new fighter jets ? 
  no fighter jets , at least not in the short term . 
  surface to air missile systems , akin to patriot are likely to be among the first costly purchases . 
  we are about to make a large order for wheeled apcs , but this plan was already in the pipeline before deciding to increase the spending . 
  also , we 're about to buy some polish grom man-portable missiles . 
  it is expected that the infantry should be modernised . 
  i do n't know what will be done next . 
  however , minister of defence explicitly told that there currently are no plans to buy planes . 
  lithuania is opening a lng import terminal later this year , first on the baltic shores , i think . 
  other countries that have ability to import lng would be able to benefit from this new legislation too . 
  however , our energy sector is heavily dependent on russian gas , and we are forced to overpay for it by about 30 % , so this request is very much ours . 
  yeah , that was quite emotional for a senate hearing . 
  but not oprah-emotional , more like reagan-emotional .
