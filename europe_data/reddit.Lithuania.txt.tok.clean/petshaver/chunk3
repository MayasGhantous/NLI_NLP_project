   i am also here to plead with you and your colleagues to do everything within your power to help us achieve that objective by expediting the release of some of your abundant natural gas resources into the world market , especially to those nations beholden to a monopolistic supplier .

  ** lithuania ** * lithuania celebrates 10 year anniversary of joining nato . 
  * 7 parliamentary parties sign a commitment to gradually increase the defence spending ( from current 0.8 % ) to 2 % of gdp in 2020 . 
  * at the us senate hearing , lithuanian energy minister urges lawmakers to allow nato allies to buy american liquefied natural gas . 
  * lithuania may host 20 to 30 tatar refugees from crimea . 
   it was a petition asking eu regulators to block construction on grounds it was unfair competition . 
  it 's beyond ridiculous . 
  we 're talking about a ship which is being built in south korea . 
  this is a fsru , a floating terminal which will be moored in a port . 
  sure , some part of the infrastructure is on shore , but the terminal itself is on a fucking ship . 
  i 'd like to see that petition . 
  actually , lithuania is currently suing gazprom for 1.5 billion euro in stockholm international arbitrage , the reason being unfair competition , i.e. 
  illegal pricing schemes . 
  i have not heard about any legal action from the russian side trying to stop the fsru , but this project met some ressistance in our own parliament . 
  there were rumours that the russians used their influence in trying to stop the project . 
  gladly , everything is going according to the plan . 
  [ lithuanian fsru ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tbeqlxp.jpg ) , called independence ( a brilliant choice for a name , if you ask me ) , a floating lng terminal which is mounted on a ship , is arriving later this year . 
  as far as i know , there currently are no serious proposals for a lng terminal in riga . 
  however , estonia and finland are competing for a regional lng terminal funded by the eu . 
  latvia will use it as well . 
  i think , the netherlands is buying money from russia . 
   the uk stop the war coalition were pretty vocal regarding syria but have been very quiet over ukraine . 
  in a statement here [ 1 ] they seem to blame the ukraine situation on the uk , us , eu and nato . 
  i have nothing against pacifism , but why do pacifists need to be so dumb so fucking often . 
  edit : ok , so after a quick googling , it became apparent that this organisation has a stable tendency to oppose western powers . 
  fighting for peace seems to be their secondary objective . 
  this whole thing seems a bit fishy . 
  yes , the eu can reach concensus on russia . 
  however , i am afraid that at least several thousand will have to die for this to happen . 
  i was not a huge fan of the idea of kosovar independence , but it had to be done . 
  i kind of get the sentiment of kosovo being a cultural cradle of serbia , but milosevic fucked everything up big time . 
  now crimea is a different case because there are no ethnic tensions or anything of that sort . 
  mr putin is blatantly lying that russian speakers are in some kind of trouble . 
  this applies to other parts of ukraine too . 
  saying that transnistrian authorities should be assumed as pro-russian would be a severe oversimplification . 
  they are a criminal smuggling gang and it is russia which supports them because they are a pain in the ass for moldova . 
   also , if they think they can get rid of the uk they 're sorely mistaken , maintaining the balance of power in europe is our thing and has been since the 1600s . 
  we wo n't let any one country take over the continent militarily or politically . 
  this is precisely why the notorious russia today channel is so supportive of the scottish national party . 
  road quality is mostly perfect outside municipality limits , and this is where most fatal accidents happen . 
  overall network is really well developed , it 's better than in any neighbouring country . 
  there are a couple of problematic transit roads which are considered unsafe and need to be upgraded , but they alone do not have very much influence on overall fatality numbers . 
  of course , i agree that further development of roads would help to combat the fatalities to some extent . 
  sadly , road police are still somewhat corrupt . 
  i guess that it would be quite difficult to escape punishment when caught drunk driving , it 's way more serious than , say speeding . 
  but i agree that police corruption might be a contributing factor to the unsafety of roads . 
   also what the hell lithuania ? 
  lots and lots of factors , but most important are these : * drunk driving still seems to be culturally accepted in some parts of society . 
  * we import quite a lot of older second hand cars . 
  they are not too good safety-wise . 
   you forgot that after the personality change russia took krokodil and attacked poland with a rusty shiv . 
  this happened after finland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland and ukraine used the opportunity of russia being unconscious and managed to sneak out from the cellar of the pub where russia was keeping them . 
  right after escaping , besides trying to dodge russian knife , poland got into a fight with lithuania over a girl from vilnius who was half jewish . 
  then ukraine who had a multiple personality disorder , started hitting his head to the wall . 
  russia then attacked ukraine with the same rusty chiv and pushed him back to the cellar . 
  this is extremely interesting . 
  can anyone explain why the headlines are cautious ? 
  i understand that commercial production of graphene would be a huge breakthrough , but is it possible that something is fishy about this story ? 
  ** lithuania ** * president grybauskaite announced her plans to run for a second term in an election in may . 
  will run independently , but with a backing by two main right wing parties . 
  grybauskaite is a leader in opinion polls , likely to win the election . 
  * dmitry bulatov , leader of ukrainian automaidan who was tortured for more than a week fled ukraine and arrived in vilnius where he was provided with treatment by lithuanian government . 
  * lithuania assumed rotating one month presidency of the un security council on monday . 
  syria , central african republic and south sudan are on agenda . 
  * african swine fever arrives in lithuania from belarus . 
  a hunted wild boar tested positive to the disease . 
  in worst case scenario , this may lead to a substantial hit to the agrarian sector . 
  russia about to stop pork imports from the whole eu . 
  targeting whole eu instead of affected regions may or may not be related to the situation in ukraine . 
  * russia stops embargo for dairy product imports for all lithuanian companies . 
  trade about to resume . 
  * 9 lithuanian athletes are competing in the sochi olympics . 
  as usual , no medals are expected in winter olympics . 
  however , there is a lot of attention to the games . 
   and \u0160koda train  these are really comfy !, 
  currently our most modern trains until they build a high speed railway connecting the baltic states . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , we have 8 , and 2 more still to be delivered by skoda . 
  dozens !, 
  there are dozens of us !, 
  it is important to understand that there is not much that can be done in order to punish the leaders without hurting the general population . 
  this is why the possible sanctions work best as a deterrent . 
  yanukovich knows that if he moves forward with a crackdown , eu would impose sanctions targeted to the regime and the oligarchs . 
  by no means this is a sure way to stop him from violence , but it may have some influence . 
  eu is , as you put , it in an expansion phase for many years already , and there currently are no signs that it is coming to a halt . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_the_european_union#timeline everything is going according to the plan . 
  we are building a future superpower here . 
  chillax . 
  do n't see this plan working out , to be honest ;(, 
  bbc world service radio ran a 9 minute feature on vilnius january events yesterday . 
  i think , it turned out really well : http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01p2pd0, 
   you are a strange lithuanian , but you are an impressive example of confirmation bias if you are from the russian minority . 
  what we are dealing with here is not someone with a heavy confirmation bias , but a very real example of a propaganda drone . 
  this account was purposely created to make pro-kremlin comments on lithuania-related ( and similar ) topics and is supported by several other shadow accounts . 
  this is not the first case of this phenomenon on reddit . 
  please check out / u/eult and notice recurring patterns . 
  this is a very common thing on lithuanian-speaking web . 
  our news websites are infested with anti-lithuanian comments , which are spread using semi-automated means . 
  also , networks of sock-puppet accounts that are not corresponding to real people are spreading similar information on facebook .
