  what you are seeing is a far extending arm of the same system . 
  needless to say , it is worthless to spend much time when dealing with these things . 
  debunk propaganda by simply downvoting . 
  use factual data and appropriate sources if there is a real risk that people would fall for false information . 
  we 're experiencing a gradual cultural shift on how we present ourselves in public . 
  it 's quite slow and hard to notice from the inside , but foreigners who are visiting say once every 10 years tell that people smile a lot more now . 
  actually , this is what we like to think about ourselves , so the change may be not so big as we are led to believe , i do n't really know . 
  customer service is a whole different story . 
  you ca n't even imagine how it has improved . 
  20 years ago it was a quite ordinary thing for staff members in stores to be extremely rude with customers . 
  when the free market kicked in and shop assistants started using simple phrases like hello , thank you and goodbye , it was something completely out of this world . 
  it felt very unnatural at first . 
  i agree absolutely . 
  there are many pieces in this puzzle . 
  gdr also had all these kinky magazines and mixed nude beaches , while such things were a no-no in soviet union . 
  communist world was not culturally monolithic . 
  give us some time , i hope we will catch up . 
  we are already miles beyond some certain countries in this regard . 
  russia buying huge amounts of iranian oil ? 
  i need to wrap my head around it somehow . 
  federal * europe, 
  to anyone who wonders what has happened in this thread . 
  i was consoling ( as i suspect ) a moderately drunk estonian , who was very upset . 
  this happened very late on a friday night . 
  i know , i know . 
  anti-baltic ( and anti-western in general ) evangelism has been running cranked up to 11 on russian media recently . 
  some things are quite harsh and can really hurt sometimes . 
  it 's true that some people with a quite strange agenda who constantly bash our countries appeared here . 
  but i do n't think it 's much of a problem . 
  while the hive-mind of reddit tends to have certain political angles you might agree or not agree with ( especially on some larger subreddits ) , factual errors and blatant lies on / r/europe are quickly debunked . 
  that was quick : http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/1uxar6/a_big_day_for_lithuania/, 
  well , op 's posting history aside , this is the actual title of the article . 
  what a horribly misleading title . 
  latvian and estonian waffen-ss units were not nazi . 
  yes , it may seem strange , even disturbing for some , as baltic legions were wearing the same dreadful ss insignia . 
  however these units were cleared of all charges by the allies . 
  moreover , latvian ss soldiers were even guarding nazi war criminals during nuremberg trials , and after that , hq of the usa army . 
  you are welcome to read more [ on the matter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_legion#after_world_war_ii ) . 
  and of course , the red army , which occupied the baltic states was the principal enemy of the baltic legions . 
  problem ? 
  i think , lithuania and poland should build a joint space station called the commonwealth . 
  well , kudos to estonians . 
  they will also be the first baltic country to become [ a full member of esa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_the_european_space_agency#current_progress ) . 
  we have to agree that estonians were the first of us to develop a certain achiever mentality . 
  i 'm actually sure that this race of the baltic countries in various areas is having a considerable impact on our quick development . 
  russkies took most of the bees from the baltics and finland !, 
  it 's because bees are [ not available in russia ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/72159000/jpg/_72159367_beemap1.jpg ) . 
  i think that one can ridicule and be confused , but no one has the right to approve or disapprove anyone 's polishnness . 
   but how polish can you be if you do n't know the language ? 
  so , there is [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_j._shiller ) who won the nobel prize in economics last year . 
  he happens to be an american of lithuanian descent , but his name does not remind a lithuanian name . 
  of course , almost everyone including the media was oblivious to the fact that he is lithuanian , until he himself was like ` hey , guys !, 
  i think i 'm the first ethnic lithuanian to win a nobel ! ', 
  of course , after this he got an award from lithuanian president and lots of media attention . 
  he also gave some lectures for lithuanian students and the public . 
  in english , of course . 
  because he does not speak lithuanian , or as he said himself ' i can only speak baby lithuanian ' . 
  but he identifies with his lithuanian ancestry , and considers himself a lithuanian . 
  does it make him one or not ? 
  i 'm sure it does . 
  self-identification is * the * definitive cut-off line . 
  are you trying to imply that standard of living in greece right now is somehow comparable to one of ussr from several decades ago ? 
  you are completely delusional . 
  the term racism can be and often is used to refer to ethnic discrimination which is not based on skin colour . 
  moreover :  according to the united nations convention , there is no distinction between the terms racial discrimination and ethnic discrimination . 
  ( [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism ) ) . 
  seems like a good reason to at least try to get rich then . 
  we 're making a bet that shit is not hitting the fan anytime soon . 
  it 's a good bet in my opinion . 
  just do n't steal anything . 
  so , this got me thinking : who 's bigger legend , michael schumacher or ayrton senna ? 
  my guess is that most of this ` foreign investment ' money is not really foreign after all . 
  it 's russian money stashed in tax havens abroad . 
  main lithuanian export at 21 % is petroleum and oil products . 
  no idea why it 's ` unclassified ' in op 's source . 
   if i was the baltic states , i would not export shit to the assholes in the east !, 
  businesses are free to do as they wish , and russia is a highly profitable , albeit ( as we 're witnessing right now ) unpredictable market , which happens to be next-door . 
  around 15 % of exports from the baltic states go to russia . 
  not as much as in the past , but still quite a lot . 
  if you 're suggesting that governments of the baltic states should impose an embargo for exports to russia , that would hurt businesses , and would also stand against fair practice of international trade . 
  actually , our policies would become much more reminiscent of kremlin style of running things . 
  i was just pulling your leg . 
  national stereotypes , you know ... 
  an english-speaking frenchman ? 
  impossible !, 
  vilnius had the needed critical mass to break out , it has been always attracting most of the skilled workforce from all lithuania . 
  also , the largest airport is located here . 
  it 's quite possible that kaunas and klaipeda both have potential to achieve more significance on international level , but so far vilnius is the clear leader . 
  shameless plug for my city , vilnius : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpo4tbv4uhk, 
  i 'm not actually able to follow your point . 
  please elaborate . 
  in what particular situation lithuania is lacking ability to stand up against russia ? 
  i 'm not saying it 's not true or anything , i just do n't get what exactly you mean . 
  when and how , according to you , this should change ? 
  what these different reactions should be ? 
  flag of [ ukrainian insurgent army ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army ) ( 1942-1956 ), 
   businesses have only been doing this for 30 years or so . 
  you probably think that legally binding digital signature is the same thing as some document sent by email . 
  it is not . 
  something like that , only russian is used mostly for curses .
