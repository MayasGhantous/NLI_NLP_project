  we use [ russian mat ` language ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mat_\\ ( russian_profanity \\ ) ) , which is slightly adapted to work better with lithuanian grammar . 
  yeah . 
  well , i hear quite a lot of * fucks * and * shits * . 
  also some occasional * bitches * and * motherfuckers * . 
  we swear using a mix of russian , lithuanian and english curses with a pinch of polish added for flavour . 
  i agree that a picture of a drug den is not highly representative of lithuania . 
  period . 
  i will also copy-paste my another comment from down below :  it was n't actually supposed to be some sort of a showcase on how each country is doing . 
  each of these pictures is telling some sort of a story . 
  if the photographer was interested in shady places and dirty stuff , i 'm good with it , as long as the pictures are good . 
  and they are good . 
   it 's funny how some people see pro-russian , while others see anti-russian propaganda here . 
  in my opinion , it 's neither . 
  but it 's definitely not what 's it like to live in former republics of the ussr . 
  the problem is the title , which has been chosen by the russian website that snitched the pics . 
   he 's not even lithuanian this is not relevant at all . 
   this is a terrible showcase . 
  correct .

  relax dude , jesus died for you . 
  afaik , * krokodil * is not being used over here . 
  perhaps , chronic use of low quality heroin could do that ? 
  sadly , there is no back story to that picture . 
  edit : i found photographer 's [ website ] ( http://www.nickhannes.be/flash.html ) . 
  description of the pic : andre tashkunas , a 22 year old russian junk , lies in his bed with heavily infected legs . 
  vilnius , lithuania , july 15 , 2008 . 
  poor fuck is probably dead by now . 
  a capital city with an undeniably hip vibe ( ny times ) . 
  the album was published yesterday on a popular russian picture blog [ big picture ] ( http://bigpicture.ru/?p=402019 ) . 
  since most of you ca n't read russian , i 've taken the liberty and reuploaded pics to imgur . 
  this way i was able to add english captions . 
  this post , in particular the choice of a [ picture for representing life in vilnius ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j3rh6ac.jpg ) , has attracted some attention from lithuanian media and has caused a slight stir on facebook . 
  anyway , it 's an interesting , albeit peculiar gallery . 
  please enjoy . 
  * * * edit : since this post is getting traction , i 'm adding translation for dramatic introductory text from the [ original source ] ( http://bigpicture.ru/?p=402019 ) . 
  no more information is provided , not even the name of the photographer . 
   all pictures taken during one year of travel around former soviet republics . 
  efforts in defining national identity of newly found states after the collapse of the communist empire can be seen in the pictures . 
  a land of contrasts , full of wealth and poverty . 
  rapid development of cities sharply contrasts with deprivation of surrounding neighbourhoods . 
  gold plated images of new dictators in the background of fading power . 
  * * * edit 2 : so , i got an idea of running a reverse image search , and it paid off !, 
  pictures are from a book * red journey * by belgian photographer nick hannes . 
  taken in 2008 ... 
  there are many more pictures from the series on photographer 's website . 
  no direct link , since it 's an old flash website : http://www.nickhannes.be/flash.html  red journey  view album . 
  as far as i know , many younger residents actually like to call the city koenig , which is a nickname derived from k\u00f6nigsberg . 
  also , some businesses and organisations incorporate koenig/k \u00f6nigsberg into their names . 
  all this german legacy has became a quite hip thing recently . 
  this was n't the case a couple of decades ago , so i believe that some of the elderly residents might not be not as enthusiastic . 
  just do n't overdo it , do n't suggest any ideas that kaliningrad should not belong to russians , and you 'll be fine . 
  as for sightseeing , you should probably check lonely planet , wikivoyage and the likes . 
  we should n't even think about redrawing borders in europe , except when adhering to the right of self determination . 
  telling that a particular territory should belong to some another country is a baaaad idea , at least in my opinion . 
  it would be best if anyone from kaliningrad could comment on this . 
  nevertheless , i will add my two cents to the discussion . 
  citizens of kaliningrad have formed a slightly distinct identity from the mainland russians after the collapse of ussr , and the differences are only increasing . 
  people tend to identify with europe , many of the youngsters have n't actually visited russia proper , as opposed to other european countries . 
  citizens of kaliningrad have also started to embrace the german legacy of the city they are living in , while the german city is no more , as almost everything has been destroyed . 
  a quite peculiar situation , if you ask me . 
  in my opinion , it 's quite likely that support of pro-western movement in ukraine is higher in kaliningrad than elsewhere in russia . 
  but it 's not likely at all that anything like euromaidan could happen in kaliningrad . 
  moscow would never allow it . 
  i 'm not using a hyperbole here . 
  some people are literally asking for military intervention :  we , people of ukraine ( ... ) taking into account the decision role of the united states of america in a worldwide policy and reputation of the usa , as a defender of democratic rights and freedoms in the whole world , we ask you , as a commander-in-chief by the armed forces of the usa , to enter military intervention to ukraine . 
  ( signed by  9,000 people ) https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/enter-military-intervention-ukraine/px9f3jxv my point is that i disagree with you , as i do n't think that us should ` butt out ' . 
  while this petition is bollocks , my point is that the image of us in ukraine is just about perfect in comparison with russia nowadays . 
  americans are the good guys to the ukrainians . 
  kerry is acting wisely by expressing support for pro-western course of ukraine . 
  he 's being listened to in ukraine , and his words do matter to the people . 
   not helping at all - i really think the us should ` butt out ' on this one . 
  it might look this way judging from good old anti-american point of view . 
  if you think that american foreign policy is somewhat evil , it 's understandable to think that american support only does harm . 
  now it 's a whole different story for ukrainians . 
  more than half of population are trying to push the country closer to the west ( to europe * and * the states ) . 
  the alternative would be to be caught in the russian sphere of influence . 
  kerry does n't seem such a bad guy in this context . 
  ukrainians have been flooding the website of the white house en masse , signing various petitions and asking americans to involve . 
  some of the petitions were quite silly , people were basically asking for american armed forces to come over . 
   how could they think that it was ever a good idea ? 
  playground in the middle of a lawn on top of supermarket is a brilliant idea . 
  as are roof gardens or any other kind of [ green roofs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_roof ) . 
  and rooftop pools . 
  and so on . 
  provided these things are * done right * . 
  sorry , but you just fail to identify the problem correctly here . 
  well , latvians have been extraordinarily active in that usa today online poll , that 's for sure . 
  still , riga is quite beautiful . 
  not ` prettiest in europe ' beautiful , but definitely very nice .
