  explain . 
  so you 're telling me that visa requirements for citizens of all eu countries must be identical ? 
  that all governments must have either a visa free regime with all eu countries , or with none of them ? 
  that 's something very new to me . 
  do romanian citizens have a ** right ** to have an equal visa regime to citizens of other eu countries ? 
  i 'm terribly sorry if there is such principle in international law , but it is unknown to me . 
  you must provide me with some sources or references in order to prove your point . 
  if there is such a right , than romanian government should have demands to other countries too , not just canada !, 
  for example , south africa has a visa free regime with czech republic , but not with romania . 
  there are many , many more examples like this . 
  and what would be the basis for * demanding * the same visa regime as the czech republic ? 
  or any other country ? 
   it truly was hooliganism . 
  you ca n't just walk in on a critical industrial installation , hope to damage stuff and sabotage because-well-fuck-you-we-dont-like-modern-technology and expect nobody bats an eye : / i 'm struggling to find a good explanation on why hooliganism has to be legally defined as a crime or some kind of misbehaviour . 
  it 's just such a vague umbrella term . 
  during soviet times , young people displaying some attributes of counter culture , like wearing atypical clothing , long hair etc. 
  were often punished for ` hooliganism ' . 
  seems , that even now in russia it is a suitable excuse to punish for almost anything . 
  why do n't they get rid of this anachronism and instead use proper laws and punish for trespassing , vandalism , industrial sabotage , public drunkenness , unsanctioned protests , noise , etc. 
  whatever is actually suitable . 
   romania has threatened not to ratify a recently signed eu-canada free trade deal unless ottawa lifts visa requirements for romanians . 
  romania , please do n't . 
  i suppose , visa free regimes are not very often based on blackmail . 
   the largest party received 46.6 % in the last election . 
  ( pro-russia ) i disagree that the ruling party can be considered pro-russian , at least not anymore . 
  they are clearly pro-european now . 
  current government is about to sign association agreement with eu and to move the country westwards . 
  this is a blow of colossal proportions to russia .

  true , except that polish occupation of vilnius took place not during wwii , but right after wwi . 
  the fact kaunas * was on the original map * before being replaced by kernave in an * updated version * , means that op has made a mistake making the original map . 
  * it is widely accepted that the first known capital of lithuania is kernav\u0117 , mentioned in 1279 . 
  * modern lithuania * officially * keeps continuity of historical lithuania . 
  our current constitution states the legal basis of the codification of the 16th century in the very first sentences . 
  * historical lithuania was not always called grand duchy of lithuania . 
  the name and its legal status was not consistent . 
  * the act of independence of lithuania ( february 16 , 1918 ) was signed in vilnius by the council of lithuania with vilnius as its capital . 
  on 1 january 1919 occupying german army withdrew from vilnius turning the city over to polish . 
  lithuanian government evacuated and moved to kaunas , which became the temporary capital of lithuania . 
  except that it 's nothing like interwar map . 
  it 's an up to date political map of europe with current countries and their boundaries . 
   asked if the drill is designed to show russia that nato is serious about defending its former communist and former soviet members , the nato official said : `` this exercise is about the nato response force , and making sure that it is able to defend any ally , deploy anywhere and deal with any threat . 
  it is based on a fictional scenario , including a fictional opposing country . '', 
  translation of diplomatic lingo : yes . 
   reuters sent photographer maxim shemetov to document the scene in sochi as construction continues why the fuck they decided not to show a single olympic venue or some pictures of larger construction sites ? 
  i get it , corruption is rampant , there are severe delays in the works , and many other problems . 
  i 'm sure , that photographer did n't have to search too hard for opportunities to snap pictures of broken windows , stray dogs , etc. 
  but judging from this picture set , sochi is some dodgy 3rd world town , which is not exactly the case . 
  location of kernav\u0117 , lithuania is off by 50 km or so . 
  sorry , but i have to disagree . 
  ** [ kernav\u0117 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kernav%c4%97 ) ** is the first known capital of lithuania ( mentioned in 1279 ) . 
  this historical fact is widely accepted , being taught in schools , etc. 
  there possibly were castles before kernav\u0117 , that served as capitals . 
  [ voruta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voruta ) was briefly mentioned around 1251 . 
  there are some people , who think that voruta could be considered the first capital , but we known nothing about this castle , not even its location . 
  vilnius was not purposely built as the capital . 
  the settlement is much older , and archaeological data confirms it . 
  a castle complex was purposely built there and that was how vilnius became capital ( first mentioned in 1323 ) . 
  there was no such thing as a * de jure * capital in medieval lithuania . 
  important castle where the ruler resides equals capital in a modern sense . 
  for example , trakai was lithuanian capital for some time ( from around 1375 ) . 
  i do n't think it 's anything besides pure demagogy . 
  if i wanted to start an agricultural business in bulgaria , i would simply start a bulgarian company and buy some land . 
  this would be the preferable way to operate a business even if the ban was lifted . 
  we have a similar ban until next year . 
  and we also have some populist politicians telling we should extend it . 
  funnily , at the same time , there are foreign companies that are successfully operating via lithuanian subsidiaries . 
  this does not seem to be a problem at all . 
  correct , the purpose of the lng terminal in lithuania , is not only additional import capability , but also putting us into a position where we can start bargaining with gazprom . 
  lng demand is also on the rise , import terminals are under construction in many places , besides the baltic shores . 
  also , it seems that the world is finally getting rid of the remaining dependency on coal and switching to gas where possible . 
  i 'm not sure if it is insightful to expect this ` super cheap ' gas . 
  however , cheaper gas is possible , and indeed would be great . 
  as for lithuanian lng imports , norway , usa , qatar and malaysia are among first possible suppliers , according to the media . 
  i 'm sorry , but this is a load of crap . 
  * we still do n't know how much shale gas we have , and if it 's economically sound to produce it . 
  exploration has not yet started . 
  therefore , it is unknown if the economic boost would be slight , significant , huge , or non-existent altogether . 
  * what desolate wasteland are you talking about ? 
  do you even have a slightest idea how a gas rig looks like ? 
  i will help you , [ this is the first shale gas rig ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gegpb8w.jpg ) , that has recently started operating in poland . 
  * water contamination might be an issue in some rare cases , but do you have an idea how much fracking is currently done in the states ? 
  do you know that 22 horizontal wells have been drilled by using hydraulic fracking in the last 12 years in lithuania ? 
  were there any cases of water contamination ? 
  * i do n't even know what to tell about the oak connection part . 
  i do n't even ... is this / r/trees ? 
  edit : pardon me for my harshness , as i have missed fascinating suggestion made by / u/muupeerd , that we should chop down the forests and use wood for our energy demands . 
  i misunderstood your comment about desolate wasteland , as being about effect of gas production . 
  where does this this ` super cheap ' prediction come from ? 
  i certainly hope that you 're right , but short-term and mid-term predictions are not that good , at least from what i 've heard . 
  the thing is that the japanese have shut all their nuclear plants because of fukushima , and started to buy lots of gas for their energy needs . 
  this has ended oversupply of lng and lifted up the prices by quite a bit . 
  lithuanian lng terminal , mentioned in this article , will be ready next year . 
  now the government is looking for lng suppliers . 
  there were recent reports in the media , that the gas price will probably not be as good as we hoped for , at least for as long as japanese will keep running on gas . 
  however , the situation will still be much better than having to buy overpriced gas from the sole supplier . 
  ** lithuania ** * lithuania gets a non-permanent seat in the un security council for the next two years . 
  * tensions with russia at highest point since the break up of the soviet union . 
  lithuanian dairy import ban still in place . 
  * government resurrects plans for a new japanese-built nuclear power plant .
