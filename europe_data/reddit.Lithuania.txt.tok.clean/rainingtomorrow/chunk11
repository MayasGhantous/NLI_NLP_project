  just like anywhere , they are free to post whatever gets most clicks or views . 
  and these things get a lot of clicks and views does to emotional loading and easy-to-fabricate emotions of the readers . 
  it also helps that immigrants to norway ( or emigrants from lithuania ) are often poorest and least educated part of public that could not make a living here . 
  intelligent , middle class people do not buy this , and in fact , there is a lot of ridicule given to those who believe that `` inbred norwegians ( seriously wtf ) are removing lithuanian children from their parents to increase the quality of their gene pool '' . 
  yup , works the same way here as well . 
  i guess it 's a bit more liberal here than in ` old ' europe . 
  depends on country , but normally you would need to be a resident to open a bank account ( i.e. 
  in finland , i was requred to bring a copy of my registration on kela ( if i am not mistaken , maybe that was vero ) in order to have it ) . 
  i think e-residency may allow you to open a bank account there ( or at least do transactions on already opened one ) , but you will still need to visit [ embassy twice before that ] ( https://e-estonia.com/e-residents/apply-2/ ) . 
  i suggest reading slightly more informative article [ here ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/russian-aggression-nordic-states-extend-their-military-cooperation-7975109.html ) rather than bastartised american version . 
  i agree : it 's kind of good for us . 
  depending on sector , finnish , swedish , other nordic companies generally have relatively high costs of operating due to high prices of services and labour costs . 
  in order to stay competitive , just like anywhere in world , they outsource it . 
  a lot of white ( in some industries also blue , but generally the price is a bit high ) collar work is done from baltics which is quite good for several reasons : it raises wages , it transfers a lot of knowledge , and it attracts other investment and business . 
  in a way , it 's a chain reaction : let 's say swedish company establishes shared service centre in vilnius and hires 400 people . 
  because that 's quite large company , it has contracts with facilities service company , payroll company , accounting company and so on . 
  none of these companies have office in vilnius , but because one of their key clients opened it up - they follow and open office here as well , hiring 20 more people each . 
  now that they are operating with one key client , they may as well offer the services to other already operating companies , then they expand more : now to 40 people each . 
  as these companies need services themselves , local companies providing them ( i.e. 
  it company doing lithuanian payroll systems , cleaning company offering temp cleaners , etc. ), 
  also get new business and thus hire more people , what is very good again . 
  downside of this is that it makes life slightly more difficult for local companies as talented people may choose international ones over higher wages and better career prospects , and also puts country on risk if international company leaves . 
  correct me if i am wrong , but every single eu state has to approve any eu enlargement . 
  this means , that governments responsible for that have to account for such decision to their voters . 
  is it possible , that individual eu state would have referendum whether to let another state in ? 
  in any case , if such process was to take place now , i doubt whether baltic states and poland would be very keen on giving a go on this . 
  it 's not logic , but empirically more likely . 
  if finland and sweden had been in nato , opponents of baltic states ' accession could have used that as an argument against . 
  it sounds completely plausible that if there was an explicit agreement of baltic states defence responsibility guaranteed by finland and sweden , and some kind of nato association agreement , some would say that full membership is unecessary at the time and would annoy russia .

  sorry , that i am laughing but at first i read `` i could n't believe i boned more french than any americans ... '' but that 's at least half-truth when it comes to erasmus . 
  where did you go , by the way ? 
  more than 14 years ago i started playing [ tibia ] ( http://www.tibia.com ) . 
  it 's 2d mmorpg developed in germany . 
  i think i played it for 7-8 years before retiring completely . 
  polish colleagues from here may know what i am talking about , not sure about others , though  . 
  we will not be satisfied till our quality of life reaches the level of our nordic colleagues . 
  i am now actively working on that . 
  okay , this is not the first time , but certainly worth mentioning . 
  i was on my erasmus in finland , going on a tram from my university . 
  some american woman overheard me talking in english and began small talk ( i guess she was desperate because finland ) with me . 
  somehow it was brought up that education is free in finland , to her genuine surprise . 
  she replied semi-ironically `` so you mean i could just go and study in university here for free ? 
  '' , to which i answered `` well , you 're not a citizen of eu , so no '' . 
  i was browsing the gypsy thread and had images from there open as well as this one . 
  i did not notice a change . 
  you guys all have the same colours in your flags . 
  sorry to be combobreaker though . 
  income inequality is one of the issues that certainly have to be addressed . 
  currently , both lithuania , and latvia and estonia have economic models that are fairly biased towards liberalism . 
  obviously this is in order to let the business grow as fast as possible . 
  long-term strategy of lithuania , and i believe of latvia and estonia , is to slowly move to a model more similar to the rest of the nordic countries . 
  as it is described in the strategy i mentioned :  the nordic-baltic orientation does not ignore national specificities , nor does it speak about cultural or historic dependence on the nordic region . 
  on the contrary , different identities and traditions are embraced , emphasizing convergence based on values which lie at the heart of a successful welfare state . 
  i really enjoyed the trilateral meeting part , but i am not sure if i got `` all over tv today '' one . 
  where 's the joke ? 
  no corporate tax for reinvested part of profits . 
  that is why it makes sense a lot to use estonian registered company as a holding company . 
  '' ... a lithuanian woman was killed ... '' no stereotypes at all, 
  we are no longer poor . 
  take that , latvia !, 
  it 's ~ 80m ^ 2 , however it has one bedroom . 
  maybe op has meant one room rather than one bedroom ? 
  if that 's true , it makes vienna especially attractive as a city to live . 
  i live in the center of vilnius and am paying ~ 600 eur a month . 
  he 's protopolish , so he projects . 
  the tractors are well parked . 
  it 's somewhat pleasant to look at . 
  if you feel that a lithuanian is rude to you , they most likely do n't have anything against you . 
  with our directness and fairly strict-sounding accent we may come off as rude quite easily , but mostly it 's just people behaving how they are used to . 
  those who have been here frequently mention horrible service in public places . 
  no excuse for that , but more often than not - it 's nothing personal against you . 
  here 's a [ link ] ( http://kam.lt/download/55077/2016%20aktyviu%20veiksmu%20gaires%20internetui_.pdf ) for you , i am sure you will understand some of it !, 
   the only move poutine could do we could n't counter would be an invasion of baltic states the only thing ... 
  jokes aside it 's not a nice feeling . 
  the story goes fairly simply : 33 syrian and 2 iraqi refugees organise themselves to rent a bus and escape to germany . 
  before this , the refugees were relocated from italy or greece . 
  lithuania already accepted over 200 refugees , however this is not the first time this happens , so the current number of refugees is way lower , albeit unspecified . 
  what 's really interesting is that it 's a second high level resignation that mentions [ ihor kononenko ] ( https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/saakashvili-resigns-accuses-poroshenko-allies-corruption.html ) as someone who prevents reforms . 
  the first was aivaras abromavi\u010dius ( lithuanian national ) , formerly a minister of economy in ukraine who [ resigned in the beginning of the year ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/economic-minister-resignation-ukraine-crisis-aivaras-abromavicius ) . 
  ihor kononenko , currently in parliament , is said to be one of the closest allies of poroshenko . 
  in fact , they are also close business partners . 
  any ukrainians here can share their take on him ? 
  no , they are not particularly green . 
  they are more like `` agriculturalists '' ( e.g. 
  leader being an owner of a massive agricultural business ) . 
  they do absolutely oppose construction of a new nuclear power plant though , and have been doing this since forever . 
  i 'm not the op , but the `` exploitation '' part is not really mainstream and i would n't even be able to tell accurately what exactly it 's about . 
  i believe they 're upset that we do not have a single lithuanian-owned bank right now , while there are 5 nordic ones . 
  we lost it guys :(, 
  it will take time for wages to catch up , unfortunately there is n't an easy fix for that . 
  what can be compared though is everything else that makes up the quality of life : health , education , cities , unemployment and so on . 
  but it is still extremely difficult to do when one has n't lived there in the first place . 
  when thinking about the countries that i lived in or at least am very familiar with , one can simply see that statistics do not convey the real picture . 
  [ real adjusted gross disposable income of households per capita at ppp ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00113 ) is higher in lithuania than it is in greece , but i still find it hard to believe that people have more disposable income . 
  then again , i am not really sure what 's the point of comparing . 
  maybe to measure progress ? 
  maybe to have arguments against the majority of people living here who think that lt is utterly regressive , poor , shitty country with no future . 
  there are of course some differences in perspective .
