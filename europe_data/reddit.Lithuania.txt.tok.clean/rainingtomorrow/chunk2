  shame : /, 
  dutch send help , to serbia , lol, 
  i have mc that is fully debit card . 
  the difference between this and maestro ( which are debit cards ) is that i can still pay on internet for everything . 
  update : gps data shows that the vessel was in international waters throughout the entire time . 
  russian news agency reports that russian coastal guard that took action ( note : coastal guard has no enforcement rights in international waters ) . 
  ship 's crew consists of 3 lithuanians and 25 russians . 
  man , i 've been in rijeka quite recently and i have no idea how could you possibly afford * anything * there with your level of salary . 
  thanks for reply !, 
  makes it clear now . 
  i am going to plan the trip in detail this weekend . 
  we arrive to kutaisi and want to travel as much through georgia as possible , and to pop by armenia as well . 
  we only have one week , so i am not sure if we will make to yerevan , but i am certain we will make it to northern part of the country . 
  i saw haghpat and sanahin being unesco world heritage and that may be the destination in armenia . 
  i would love to visit yerevan too , though . 
  any advice here ? 
  thanks , did n't know this in such detail . 
  because bank was displaying different exchange rate , i assumed it would be a separate currency . 
  why would they need separate `` version '' of pound apart from wanting to have their own picture on it ? 
  sure !, 
  according to op , belarus , for example , is neither politically , nor culturally europe . 
  according to same logic , armenia should not be considered `` cultural europe '' , as it is further away culturally than belarus . 
  i personally disagree with this , but was just pointing out what i perceived as flaws in logic . 
  in any case , i am going to visit armenia in two weeks . 
  i can check it up then with my own eyes  . 
  well , movie tickets are cheaper over there . 
  i think the fair way to talk about prices in international context is in ratios . 
  in estonia movie ticket costs 0.57 % , while in france it is 0.45 % of average net monthly salary . 
  i fully agree . 
  no country looking to be modern should compare itself to india . 
  it 's just really bad headline , even if the article explains it properly . 
  so this lithuanian bank introduced scottish pound with no reason :( [ picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nqn1m3p.jpg ) by the way , i took this picture like half a year ago . 
  45 % is plenty , as it needs only for 2,5 % of population to change their minds . 
  can a referendum happen again in some years time ? 
  edit : embarrassing math mistake , it should have been 5 % . 
  i have my doubts about armenia on this one . 
  also , if you do n't include turkey , then half of cyprus should n't be included . 
  if you include serbs , then serbian parts of bosnia should be included . 
  also northern kosovo . 
  and more ukraine , this map does n't even include kiiv . 
  culturally , belarus is more european than georgia , but pretty good job in overall . 
  i guess it 's easier to lay a massive data cable under a field than under old towns , living districts , commercial districts and so on . 
  oh , that explains `` polska '' , it 's an adjective !, 
  [ can you guess why ? 
  ] ( https://theusindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/chernobyl_theusindependent.jpg ), 
  sure !, 
  admittedly , this is based on several assumptions that may or may not be correct . 
  nato is probably single most important factor in regards to security of baltic states . 
  security of europe in general largely depends on a group of the strongest countries within nato : usa , uk , and france . 
  in turbulent times one does n't want for allies to weaken . 
  assuming that uk will get weaker ( territory , military , money ) , and as * military * cooperation between separate states usually does n't work as synergy , we can assume that `` yes '' outcome weakens nato . 
  also , russia uses separatism as its tool and may take it further in ways only putin knows . 
  if catalonia and some other states begin to separate , chances are , some of them wo n't be joining eu because of many possible reasons . 
  living here , strong eu is also good for us . 
  these are basically the reasons . 
  it would interesting to hear what you think about them too . 
  every . 
  single . 
  thread . 
  and this discussion just keeps repeating itself once someone mentions `` eastern europe '' in any context . 
  getting bored of that kind of . 
  but i will still keep correcting people of proper naming in real life . 
  is this even possible to execute having in mind current state of affairs ? 
  should n't that vastly destabilise local level governance ? 
  i think similarly to you . 
  i see benefits of both positions and will be happy of scots ' choice regardless . 
  prooobably , though , if looking pragmatically solely for self-interest , `` no '' outcome is slightly more advantageous . 
   we learned this lesson of expectations and reality during ussr separation , where every republic was made to believe it would stop feeding others and become rich . 
  in result , local authorities won , and all the people lost in every republic . 
  you hardly can make benefits from separation , whatever it may seem . 
  dear \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e , we invite you to any of the baltic states to come and check how our people ` lost ' after becoming independent from ussr . 
  maybe it would be `` united kingdom of half of great britain and northern ireland '' , makes a great abbreviation : `` ukhgbni '', 
  in most of the country they are good , but kaunas is infamous for its horrible quality roads . 
  i drove there few months ago and could have easily ruined the wheels if i was n't paying attention to holes on the road . 
  it 's like slalom exercise . 
  this is good example of second-largest city syndrome . 
  the only train route that actually makes sense of using is vilnius -  kaunas . 
  anything else is slow and expensive , so no surprises on this one  . 
  but if i was railroad operator , i 'd look closely to this as there is a lot of potential . 
  til !, 
  thank you for replying , this is very interesting, 
  so * svappavaara * is finnish name that is used by swedes , * vaskivuori * is finnish name used by finns , and * veaikevarri * is sami name used by samis . 
  that is quite beautiful . 
  i was about to make a joke that you would probably be the first country to have tri-lingual street signs . 
  just to check-up , i googled that and as the first results i got actually trilingual street signs in [ helsinki : sofiankatu , or sofiegatan , or \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/sofiankatu_street_sign.jpg ) . 
  i do n't know how i did n't notice that walking through this exact street quite a few times . 
  have they been asking for russian language street signs and official recognition of russian in state institutions for all the time since ? 
  i remember you had this referendum to put russian language as second official language . 
  it 's not really producing that much food for export ( although still more ) , or having somewhat better relations with russia than the rest of baltic states . 
  there are simply a lot of businesses here that re-export western production to russia . 
  well , if germany does n't come to latvia 's aid , they will have no military organisations to fight in . 
  / joke, 
  it 's [ akrotiri and dhekelia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akrotiri_and_dhekelia ) , a british territory . 
  they do seem to have nothing better to do as they vigorously post their responses during normal work hours . 
  delfi is the worst here as well . 
  it really seems they are written by kremlin human bots . 
  i refuse to believe there are * that * many of idiots . 
  no one bothers with education in corsica , so it 's easy to skew the percentages when there are 5 men and 3 women with degrees . 
  so women are on average more likely to be educated than men in most of the europe .
