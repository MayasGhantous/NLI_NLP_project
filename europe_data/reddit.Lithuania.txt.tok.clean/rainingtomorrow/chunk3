  i do n't really know what to make of it . 
  should we encourage men to * get educated ? 
  * it 's incredibly complex issue and i have no idea what to do . 
  why am i even posting anything here , then ? 
  nice to see some `` new europe '' having good scores . 
  can you please wait like 25 years ? 
  if by then states that are currently both in eu , and in nato , and with significantly higher standard of living than the rest of former commie colonies are still lumped together , then there is something happening here in europe that is way more problematic than wrong naming . 
  what i mean to say , it will come naturally . 
  it was indeed a good game to watch  . 
  ehh , ca n't win everything , i guess . 
  fun fact # 2 : in last european championship , the final was between france and lithuania . 
  this year in world championship , the same teams fight for bronze . 
  we are going to win , by the way . 
  you are taking a lot of risks by displaying so much information about yourself . 
  i fixed it for you , but be careful next time . 
  serious question : what other flag to you suggest for them to use ? 
  current one is just plain soviet misery . 
  should they simply take [ lithuanian historical flag ] ( http://alkas.lt/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/img_4433-k100-e1383420278775.jpg ) ? 
  make a new one ? 
  thanks !, 
  i already have the tickets , so no luck in choosing the weekend . 
  the reason why i am asking is i am planning to be in constanta , and thought it may be interesting to take day 's trip to varna  . 
  i remember we would have school trips to zakopane . 
  so they put full bus of 13 year olds into a bus , and launch towards a tourist trap . 
  great !, 
  is varna worth a visit at the start of october ? 
  i am still hoping for match like [ this one in olympics ] ( http://youtu.be/bnsetae_12k?t=3m50s ) . 
  just victorious this time , of course . 
  now , europeans , wish us luck against ` murica tomorrow . 
  again ? 
  this is fucked-up . 
  by the way , hungarians , how many consecutive terms can * he * be in power ? 
  it would be interesting to hear why you think so . 
  i do n't remember people hating him * that * much . 
  i am very happy about andrus ansip ( former pm of estonia ) becoming * vice-president for the digital single market * , he has proven that he understands the portfolio of functions that fall under this responsibility well , and hopefully he will be able to use estonia 's experience for entire eu . 
  i am also happy about finland 's former pm jyrki katainen becoming * vice-president for jobs , growth , investment and competitiveness * . 
  my impression of him is that he genuinely cares about progress , future , and growth , and supported many such initiatives in finland . 
  lithuania 's vytenis andriukaitis who takes commissioner 's position for * health and food safety * is a doctor by profession turned politician . 
  i would never vote for him in local elections , but i have witnessed that he is dedicated for actually improving health . 
  also , big tobacco really does n't like him . 
  would love to hear others ' impressions too !, 
  i think he referred to actual [ spine ] ( http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/a00575f01.jpg ), 
  interesting story , thanks for sharing  . 
  i will be facing similar question soon , as my work offers for me to relocate to riga ( from vilnius ) . 
  what were the reasons to choose estonia over , say , one of the nordic countries or uk ? 
   had no family members in estonia i assume now you do , now , right ? 
  would it be possible to volunteer to check on the questions and answers ? 
  i would suggest if we have some people actually doing quantitative research ( not talking about bsc students ) to go through it just so we end up having something more reliable . 
  100k people is not as little , better make it worth . 
  how did you learn estonian ? 
  i imagine unless you live on the very border , or have estonian family members you would have no chance to learn it . 
  because russia may ask for countries that have signed extradition agreement with them to extradite these lithuanian citizens , national security department issued warning not to travel to russia , or any non-eu or non-nato states . 
  this is a bit more than ridiculous request to interrogate own citizens for not serving in soviet military , it actually may pose danger to them in foreign countries . 
  is there anything written how did , and where through they got into russia from estonian territory ? 
  this is how [ the facilities of the checkpoint ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/luhamaa,+65022+v%c3%b5rumaa,+estonia/@57.6415376,27.3707549,3a,75y,61.08h,89.72t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1svgpu8puivdztnb-1_ltktq!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x46ea8a35a4293a2b:0xd4109d647e6c8fcd ) look like from estonian side . 
  in this picture you can see it [ from russian side ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/luhamaa,+65022+v%c3%b5rumaa,+estonia/@57.644522,27.387006,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m5!1e2!3m3!1s21669399!2e1!3e10!4m2!3m1!1s0x46ea8a35a4293a2b:0xd4109d647e6c8fcd ) . 
  this is highly secured area and it is impossible to do something like that without russian officials ' support . 
  in fact , it seems that it can * only * be accomplished * by * russian officials , with mandate from government . 
  waiting for more information , but it looks very serious . 
  i see this joke all the time , but i never get the context . 
  would you care to explain ? 
  there is something so sad listening that couple talking while they are being shelled . 
  conversation of gold . 
  usually you would be right , however in this case money does not go directly to `` ukraine '' , it goes to lithuanian initiative where they simply buy various supplies . 
  it will not change the course of war , but it will help the soldiers to bear those horrid conditions a bit better . 
  here are the pics : [ 1 ] ( http://ukraine.popo.lt/files/2014/08/10636329_10203620114116013_3023722025828333723_n-300x225.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://s1.15cdn.lt/images/photos/623601/big/humanitarine-parama-ukrainai-54054622e3568.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://s1.15cdn.lt/images/photos/623601/big/humanitarine-parama-ukrainai-5405462cba810.jpg ), 
  it 's actually quite ok . because vodka is already quite strong , the taste pepper kind of dissolves in it , while honey makes it all even softer . 
  there are way more scary fish-foods over there in sweden . 
  pampersai means < took a while to remember actual word  diapers . 
  no one says it any other way . 
  here we organise supply collection points and then send stuff ( from food to clothing , sleeping bags , flashlights , batteries , and similar ) by plane . 
  if you have ukrainian friends , you can organise something like that as well . 
  links posted above should be higher . 
  from what i see in the mainstream media combined with other sources , i could say that map is actually closer to reality if you take territories that are under conflict and not fully retaken . 
  op 's map is biased in favour of ukraine , that is unfortunately true . 
  but what we actually need , is to know real situation rather the one we all would want . 
  well , this leaves finland , luxembourg , austria , hungary , switzerland , france , estonia , latvia , and lithuania as cycling heavens . 
  i find that the oddest point . 
  every single country that joined eu wanted to join eu . 
  we wanted eu and we really wanted nato . 
  good job slovenia and silesia . 
  wtf wallonia ? 
  i would assume that good relations between countries are based on cooperation , not by treating another party as a sick psycho that can explode any minute . 
  i like your systematic and fair approach . 
  thank you . 
  i think [ curonian spit ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/47417328.jpg ) would certainly suit the set . 
  it may be formally classified as cultural , but in reality it is both cultural and natural . 
  wait 40 years . 
  if nothing crazy happens in the world , it will be quite integrated region . 
  what i would really encourage everyone , is to always double-check sources . 
  according to israel national news , someone tried to storm it , while according to the source that is quoted , it 's slightly different story :  a veiled woman carried a sign reading `` every synagogue is an israeli embassy '' and waved a palestinian flag on saturday morning , according to the intercommunity coordination against anti-semitism and defamation watchdog organization , or cicad . 
  that is certainly true , dear european internet stranger whom one is able to have a conversation with . 
  you have extremely idealised image of communism which is very far from what we have seen in reality . 
  i am sure you have heard these arguments before , but i will write it here once more , just to be sure . 
  do you really think a worker under communism has more power than in market economy ? 
  that is simply not true , because under communism ( i mean communism in a sense , like actual , real-life , communism ) property is not in the hands of workers , but in hands of government 's elites . 
  workers * are given orders * from the government ( e.g. 
  via lower grade officials and factory administration ) , what they * must * do , according to five year plan made by same government elites . 
  in market economy , workers can actually unite and form labour union , for example , that would actually take their interests forth . 
  they can also leave to competing company for better conditions and salary , what is impossible under communism .
