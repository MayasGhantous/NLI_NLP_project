  it is now maximum 32 km/h . 
  it is assumed that funding comes once agreement is there . 
  while technically not certain , it is extremely likely , as it has been discussed in eu political level for quite a while and there is political support for it . 
  this report is made by organization whose : * board of directors * research committee * leadership * `` international '' advisory council consist entirely of people who are of rich , western countries , vast majority being australians and americans . 
  just sayin ' ... 
  finally !, 
  for those in the rest of europe , that 's why it 's news :  the lithuanians had had the most stipulations , demanding that vilnius , the national capital , also be connected to the line . 
  earlier this year , estonia and lithuania had been close to a diplomatic row over comments made by estonia 's then economy minister regarding the lithuanians ' unbending stance . 
  anyone has a link to original source ( with data ) ? 
  gdp/per capita , that is . 
  if even more people emigrate , it will increase even more , hurray !, 
   the way how i learned to distinguish bulgaria and romania in a map , is that i always remember when crowd yells `` boooooo !!! '' . 
  sometimes crowd points their thumbs down when they are booing somebody , and thus bulgaria = ( boooooo ) lgaria = thumbs down = the one that is down from the two . 
  posted a bit earlier , maybe will help  .

  haha , very well played !, 
  i do n't speak russian , i am not an emigrant , and i am alive . 
  they are stealing * our * jobs in britain as well . 
  it would have been very useful to have line to otaniemi , eh memories , 
  yes . 
  well , here 's the [ leader of llra ( polish electoral action ) ] ( http://s1.15cdn.lt/images/photos/616133/big/minejimas-antakalnio-kapinese-536c9c002935a.jpg ) . 
  due to this and other statements russian minority began voting for them , as shown by recent elections . 
  it sometimes seems that one of the main purposes of llra is to make lithuania-poland relations worse and advance russian interests . 
  okay , it 's latvian , but i am guessing what 's written there in the ending : `` you do n't talk shit , you do n't know , damn idiot . 
  you are dead , shit . '',

  i do n't know how it will really look like 25 years from now on , but i think it is inevitable for people to emigrate . 
  big cities have always been centres of attraction . 
  so were richer countries . 
  just like someone from romanian village goes to study medical sciences in bucharest , so does someone from bucharest moves to study to mannheim in germany , so does a graduate from mannheim moves to london to work in finances . 
  people look for opportunities to prosper . 
  because of that , eastern europe will probably remain as a donor for richer areas . 
  just like some shithole poor louisiana in us is in outskirts , eastern europe will always be in outskirts as well . 
  whether it will be shithole outskirts or rich outskirts ( like finland is , for example ) depends on how well governments will make use of the situation , the free trade in eu , and the free movement : * will government policies support creating value and jobs , or will they inhibit that ? 
  will they attract investors , or will they make obstacles for them ? 
  ( e.g. 
  lithuania is 17th in the world in doing business rating , serbia is 93rd ) * will government innovate to become more effective , will it take best practices to manage country well , will it strive to become more transparent and fight corruption ? 
  ( e.g. 
  estonia , singapore vs hungary , bulgaria ) the closer country gets to the level of `` rich '' center , the less incentive is to move somewhere , simple as that . 
  it really depends on the donor countries themselves , rather than anything what richer countries do . 
  recently in conference in tallinn speaker was arguing that free public transport did not reduce traffic jams or people commuting by car . 
  to the contrary , it actually reduced number of people walking and using bicycles . 
  the main idea was that only increased quality of public transportation can make people transfer from cars to buses and trams . 
  how it actually is ? 
  actually , as english is taught in most ( pretty much all ) of the schools in czech republic , people kind of understand it ( movies , internet adds to that as well ) , but people get those opportunities to use the language relatively rarely , thus are not very keen on speaking it in daily life if encountered , say , by a tourist . 
  when it comes to czech and slovak languages , they are similar enough to be called mutually intelligible ( i.e. 
  when you can communicate with a person using your language while another person uses his/hers ) . 
  so in this case the difference is so small , that one does not need to put much of an effort in communicating . 
  so just to sum up , there are three key points : * czech and slovak languages are mutually intelligible * it makes very little effort to speak the other language * english is taught in every czech school yet only fraction of people have enough of courage ( and opportunity ) to use it in practice hope this helps !, 
  it 's putin downvoting everything .

  exactly . 
  i wonder how different would be results if you changed `` jews '' into `` white people '' in the wording of questions and gave this survey around the world . 
  for those who wonder what questions were , here 's a [ link ] ( http://global100.adl.org/ ) - just scroll down a little . 
  well , it goes according to the whole idea . 
  domain , hehe ... 
  my attempt in explaining this , albeit i do n't know for certain : * car culture . 
  everyone is supposed to have a car . 
  cars are dreamed of by teenagers and it is common when having a choice between moving out of parents and buying a car , buying a car is chosen . 
  students have cards , families have at least two , and seniors have cars as well . 
  most of men are able to fix stuff themselves , cars are often run on natural gas , thus making maintenance and driving cheaper . 
  * car trade . 
  i do n't know exact methodology of the world bank study , but it is a fact that there are shitloads of cars in the country that are meant solely to be sold . 
  lithuanians search and buy well priced used ( and sometimes crashed ) cars in germany and the rest of western europe , then re-sell them in car markets . 
  they may be repaired if needed using cheaper labour here . 
  car markets are mostly targeted at buyers from east : belarus , uzbekistan , kazakhstan and similar countries , although if you visit one you will meet latvians , estonians , poles as well . 
  you can find info here : http://votefederalist.eu/, 
  their reasoning is that it is usually other parts of a drink that bring most of the harm ( taurine etc ) . 
  in all honesty , i believe that criticism is well-deserved and it should always be natural part of society 's discourse . 
  it is also very valuable when coming from other countries as well . 
  in my opinion , even if i see the problem and reasoning behind this legislation , i do not agree that one is able to improve situation by much by banning something . 
  if i was mp , i would have abstained from the vote . 
  this is exact opposite case - lobbyists lobbied for * not * banning energy drinks to minors . 
  think of companies that make them : red bull , pepsico , coca cola and similar are large multinational corporations . 
  the problem here is , also as an answer to / u/bleahbloh , that these drinks have actual harmful effects , and are drank by young schoolchildren , sometimes daily for lunch , few shitty quality ( shit costs like 30 eurocents ) cans a day . 
  this was initial reaction regarding the formulation of the law in media . 
  however , tea and coffee , and similar beverages are excluded from the ban in explanatory legislative documents . 
  thank you , this is actually useful . 
  russian source is writing that `` cigarettes were smuggled * from * lithuania to kaliningrad '' , which is pretty much the same as smuggling heroin from norway to afghanistan . 
  in other words , makes no sense . 
  cigarette prices in russia are four times lower and loads of them are actually smuggled into the eu . 
  but what is not surprising here , that they manage to put that small piece of propaganda even into such seemingly insignificant article . 
  i am pretty sure it has , as provided by municipal transit authority [ here ] ( http://www.vilniausviesasistransportas.lt/eismas/ ) and implemented by third party [ here ] ( http://www.marsrutai.lt/ ) . 
  where exactly the feed is , i do n't know , thought . 
  just out of curiosity , how difficult is to work with gtfs ? 
  that is actually pretty amazing !, 
  of course one always looks for one 's hometown - in my case it 's not there , but data of vilnius ' buses , for example , is available . 
  i am interested what is actual use of it ? 
  is there anything behind plain curiosity ? 
  that 's why it never worked out . 
  no one simply ever agreed who 's making the call . 
  guys , you can make a history here . 
  even if you have hypothetical `` risk free '' voting program , you can not account for these things : * network * every single other program that is running in voter 's computer * for voters and their mistakes themselves * elections officers . 
  and this is what the article is about - it takes one bribed / unfair / stupid election officer and voting results can be adjusted already .
