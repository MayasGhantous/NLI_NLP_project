  online voting is incredibly complex subject and i believe it is unfair to simplify this to `` political game or programmer not interested in making something fool-proof '' . 
  every single research into security holes of such system is extremely valuable as long as it is gives real arguments . 
  you can not simply `` want '' and then make something fool-proof , it has been tried many times , and oh so many times it failed . 
  i admire estonian government for their balls in implementing this despite all the risks , but at this point it is an experiment for everyone to watch and learn , rather than something that could be adopted on a mass scale right away . 
  you 're both looking at annual gdp growth for year 2013 . 
  estonia 's economy has shrinked by 1,9 % for q1 , compared to q1 of 2013 . 
  q1 , 2014 gdp growth compared to q1 , 2013 : * estonia : -1,9 % * latvia : 2,8 % * lithuania : 2,9 % q1 , 2014 gdp growth compared to q4 , 2013 : * estonia : -1,2 % * latvia : 0,7 % * lithuania : 0,6 % numbers are not spectacular for everyone - forecasts made last year for this year will not be met , there is a reason to be worried . 
  no go back to work and ramp up that gdp number . 
  and muslims , i believe , right ? 
  wait a second !, 
  i 've been in this place !, 
  last summer , when travelling through europe , after arriving with a train from maribor . 
  i was walking towards the old town through there . 
  obviously not the fastest route , but then again had no map of the place . 
  you slovenes are the friendliest people i 've met , by the way . 
  in any case , enough of mindfuck for today . 
  i mean ... how ? 
  i looked at this video and i basically had two thoughts in my mind : * music is quite nice , i wonder what 's the title/artist * i wonder where from the street scene is - it looks like it could have been both west and east eu ( my guess was czech rep. though ) reddit , europe , normal people and everything ... 
  hmm . . it seems that some country is missing here . 
  well skalpelis , now we are being self-bashing as we always are . 
  yes , they are most advanced , but it would be so unfair to forget that : * economically all baltic states took off massively : gdp/capita will soon overtake those of portugal , greece , and hungary , and these ones were very rich throughout the history - the are no major differences between baltic states * i am not very well aware of latvia , but when it comes to being tech-savvy , in lithuania we have like 90 % of services via e-government as in estonia , they just market themselves exceptionally well * there are anti-gay shit happening in all states , just like pro-russian shit is stronger in estonia , but these all are slowly vanishing to obscurity not that bad as we like to think of it . 
  thanks !, 
  will keep that in mind  . 
  well , it was very similar and still sometimes is . 
  maybe less shouting , but more ridiculously aggressive driving . 
  is it just me or someone else also does n't understand who are these guys who captured `` terrorists '' , as they do not look like typical ukrainian military , and why they are only two ? 
  going to visit romania this summer with a car , i see already it 's going to be fantastic journey !, 
  i think the power is balanced pretty well by germany being economic powerhouse and de facto most powerful state in eu . 
  that is indeed fun !, 
  does ep use avg . 
  pop . 
  of member state as an addition to balanced weight or is it your idea ? 
  you get beaten up two times instead of one , and then you must thank for that . 
  excellent comment . 
  that is why i love r/europe . 
  i am upvoting this because it provokes genuine discussion and points made on the source are discussable despite the nature of website itself . 
  however , the point is being made based on one sentence that vast majority of sevastopol voted in referendum and assumes that `` vast majority '' means 80 % -99 % . 
  then he makes calculations using sevastopol 's census and comes up that it is impossible that such low turnout of 30 % would be apparent . 
  he estimates that number of votes in favour could be higher . 
  in forbes article it is now clearly written that `` vast majority '' means 50 % -80 % which makes all calculations by the author wrong . 
  no matter what , voting under foreign military presence , obvious pressure to vote `` for '' , not to mention such examples as voting in streets does not give any reason to trust the results . 
  i do still believe that results would probably be somewhere around 60 % in favour if referendum was well executed , but now no one has a way of knowing that . 
  they are amazing and offer some opportunities in form of competitions and similar to see them from closer up , 
  i was n't entirely sure how exactly that was counted either . 
  i pasted it here because i trust the source and assumed that it is either gdp per capita ( ppp ) , or average income ( salary , etc ) per person at ppp , similarly how we count per household nowadays . 
  thank you , op . 
  it 's beautiful !, 
  now have to return to reading it all . 
  you have done it in true german fashion  . 
  i personally would n't mind as in a strict sense that is true . 
  however , despite being very well aware of cultural and historical context , i can not see how the world would switch to baltic in a sense only for balts any time soon . 
  i believe as the years will pass it will be similar situation as to calling finland as part of scandinavia - it 's not technically true but everyone in us gets when you say so . 
  i understand estonia for wanting to disassociate from `` baltic '' label . 
  cultural ties with finland , one of the most advanced countries in the world , is very good point for marketing estonia . 
  it is also a bridge to be considered `` nordic '' , even better label . 
  it 's all very pragmatic , especially knowing how much progress you have made and genuine adoption of many things nordic , sometimes executed even better than they did . 
  okay i admit it , it would feel kind of ... sad :( . 
  it 's tragically , horrendously genius of to starve a country sitting on the vast lands of one of the most fertile soils in the world . 
  i have seen this somewhere as well . 
  for a brief while finland was considered as a baltic state , due to the fact that all 4 states declared independence from russian empire approximately at the same time , and , well , were near baltic sea and had similar level of development . 
  just like three of us at 1991 . 
  i know for a fact that latvia was the richest of baltic states . 
  they had industrialized economy and was leading almost all metrics such as medical doctors per capita , education and so on . 
  problem is that gdp counting was n't used as widely back then so it is difficult to find good numbers that would take massive differences in price levels in countries . 
  income per capita at 1930 m : lithuania : 140 usd latvia -- 221 usd estonia -- 214 usd richest in europe at time : uk - 502 usd switzerland : 492 usd, 
  your idea is excellent !, 
  just reminds me of gdansk pre-wwii . 
  no , but seriously , thanks to media making big deal out of this , some people are already shitting in their pants . 
  thank you for the link !, 
  very interesting read . 
  worst is to get used to it . 
  good point , should have linked it . 
  [ st. petersburg times ] ( http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=100&amp;story_id=38052 ) , [ radio free europe quoting russian sources ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/russias_30_ruble_army/2347318.html ) , [ echo moskvyi ] ( http://echo.msk.ru/programs/albac/41311/ ) , [ freedom of the net report ] ( http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resources/fotn%202013%20summary%20of%20findings.pdf ) and countless of other sources on both russian and english internet .

  biggest news portal delfi.lt have made similar articles to the one op refers to . 
  less credible , but well i have checked analysis of comments made by someone else and have come up with same conclutions on how they possibly could be generated . 
  contrary to what you say , i believe we should discuss about this , and i also believe it is of benefit for all of us to assume that this is really taking place , regardless that russian government keeps this classified . 
  this is very interesting . 
  could you provide more information on anti-fracking efforts ? 
  we had a case here in lithuania when chevron was attempting to look for shale gas . 
  they received all permits needed and came according to all local law . 
  however , massive resistance popped as if out of nowhere , showing russian-made videos to local people of burning water coming from tap and so on . 
  they were quick to receive support from other groups ( greens , anti-eu groups , nationalists and so on ) and eventually government has changed law so there was no longer any business sense to continue looking for shale gas for chevron . 
  they simply left the country . 
  while it is quite obvious it is within russian interests , i would be more than interested to learn if something like that has been taking place on other countries as well . 
  there is an orchestrated campaign run by kremlin that has a goal of influencing public opinion on the internet . 
  it does not make any sense to even discuss it : it is a fact , based on proof coming from inside russia that people are hired for this purpose , based on reports by national security agencies , and if that is not enough , one can always check out those comments by oneself , as they usually remain there under the articles forever . 
  there are few points that i believe everyone should know : * the goal of these comments is to sway public opinion by making people in the west think that much larger part of population supports russian agenda than they think * that means comments must looks as genuine ( and coming from west ) as possible , and as technology behind them improves , they are getting harder to distinguish * dismissing this as conspiracy theory makes one susceptible to this one guy from estonia already wrote about this in the thread that op refers to , but i can add some from my own lithuanian experience . 
  at least some part of this campaign works like this : there is a database of common names , points , words , sentences that are used for these comments . 
  one comment is generated by randomizing name of commenter based on common names ( or sometimes random demoralizing expressions , like `` i am pissed off '' , `` i want to emigrate '' ) from that country , then generating content by combining other parts from database in random way . 
  for example , one comment might be like this `` the goal of eu is to make everyone gay . 
  putin did good job in crimea , he is welcome here too . 
  i shit on our current lithuanian villagers government '' . 
  another , like this : `` putin is welcome here too . 
  idiots on our current lithuanian eu-controlled government . 
  the goal of west is to give world for jews '' . 
  and now imagine thousands of similar comments on various news outlet websites based on similar structure and repeating themes . 
  if you pop to comment section for a short time , you may not even notice that something is off here . 
  well , you get the picture : comments are randomized so they would look more genuine . 
  they often make grammar and style mistakes that human is unlikely to do .
