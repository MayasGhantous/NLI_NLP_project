the events of [ january 13 , 1991 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_\\ ( lithuania \\ ) ) . 
  soviet troops invaded the capital . 
  hundreds of unarmed civilians defended the parliament and tv tower . 
  [ here 's a short video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yltmoftr6bc ) for context . 
  there are still ongoing trials because of this . 
  i do n't know the exact origins but still remember the times when this joke was repeated unironically . 
  it worked on multiple levels : 1 . 
  many years ago there was a hoax that * zirga galva * ( horse 's head ) is the absolute worst insult you could say to a latvian person . 
  it was funny because it 's a kind of a stupid insult . 
  it was mutually understandable ( lith . 
  * zirga galva * ) and the latvian one sounded funny . 
  like an interesting dialect or a speech impediment . 
  * \u017dirgo galva * is an oxymoron . 
  the word for a simple , common horse ( for farm labor , etc. ), 
  in lithuanian is * arklys * . 
  * \u017dirgas * , on the other hand , is n't a simple horse . 
  it 's a strong and elegant animal . 
  you would ride it to battle , participate in a horse rase , enter a competition ... 
  so to try insulting somebody by comparing them with an admirable animal ( e.g. 
  purebreed stallion ) is funny . 
  years later it became clear that this latvian `` insult '' is a hoax . 
  many latvians were n't even aware of this . 
  one can only imagine the confusion of a latvian person in lithuania being called horse 's head everyday for no reason . 
  and now the latvians are finally aware of this `` joke '' , so we can make fun of this stupid thing together . 
  there was an old joke that before joining schengen area , the border guards working on a border with latvia , used to listen to the famous lithuanian opera piece [ a\u0161 papuo\u0161iu * \u017eirgo galv\u0105 * pinavijom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nibsrvzd1e ) loudly multiple times a day . 
  there is nothing theatrical about kgb museum . 
  did you mean the soviet bunker ? 
   museums documenting the oppression we have 3 museums that always get attention from foreign tourists : 1 . 
  [ gr\u016btas park ] ( http://grutoparkas.lt/en_us/ ) is a sculpture [ park ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3941218/back-ussr-grutas-park-stalin-world-bizarre-lithuanian-theme-park-giant-statues-communist-leaders-final-resting-place.html ) . 
  according to lonely planet , it 's one of the `` world 's [ strangest ] ( https://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/the-worlds-strangest-museums/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d277175e ) museums '' . 
  [ 1984 : survival drama ] ( http://sovietbunker.com/en/1984-survival-drama/ ) - if you want something more [ active ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2642999/the-terrifying-soviet-bunker-tourist-attraction-transports-ussr.html ) . 
  the museum of genocide victims a.k.a. 
  [ kgb museum ] ( http://genocid.lt/muziejus/en/ ) is more [ serious ] ( https://jaywaytravel.com/blog/2014/kgb-museum-vilnius/ ) . 
  both his parents were lithuanian . 
  he did n't speak english until he was a teenager . 
  technically he was born already in the usa , but still ... [ karolis bu\u010dinskis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krat1-c7q98 ) was the best action star  all the death wish movies were fun to watch . 
  [ vytautas kernagis - santechnikas i\u0161 ukmerg\u0117s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chvgdjhndhy ) ( jamaica - montego bay ) [ elle g - paslaptinga sala ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vgxiv2mawo ) ( hawaii ) [ vytautas kernagis , neda malunavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 - kalifornija ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63bu85dvuo4 ) ( usa - california , albert hammond cover ) [ pergal\u0117 - sado maso germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv86xeiphbe ) ( sorry ... ), 
  because of my country 's turbulent history , we do n't have any songs that would be both `` old '' and `` patriotic '' . 
  there are old war songs and chants like , for example , [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxktxgi2bz0 ) or [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmszw6f0s_y ) but they are n't `` patriotic '' . 
  patriotic songs start only in the second half of the 19th century ( and we have lots of them , for every historical event ) . 
  the most popular is [ ant kalno m\u016brai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcvkasp-egi ) . 
  sadly , it 's origins are most likely polish or belarusian . 
  the second most popular is arguably [ balnokit , broliai , \u017eirgus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbukfpikwsy ) ( i explained the crappy youtube version [ in this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/63fcxn/does_your_country_have_folktraditional_songs_that/dftx1xb/ ) comment ) . 
  sadly , this one 's origins are most likely ukrainian . 
  my personal choice of `` patriotic '' song would be [ mil\u017ein\u0173 kapai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iobum99etci ) ( medieval setting , 19th century words , 20th century music , currently - official marching song of the national defence volunteer forces ) . 
  my second choice would be [ alyt\u0117 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cjewmh2qx8 ) ( originated during wwi , became popular during resistance period after wwii ) . 
  i love the song . 
  it 's nice , it 's a classic hit . 
  i also like the fact that a song can define a time period in history . 
  and that 's all . 
  it does n't make me feel anything more . 
  now [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kokq20rul0 ) , on the other hand , gives me goosebumps and makes me want to hug a latvian and/or estonian person whenever i listen to it . 
  although the main idea is the same ( changes , awakening ) , it 's older by 2 years ( 1989 ) . 
  the year 1991 ( when the wind of change was released as a single ) in my country is associated with a [ very different song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yltmoftr6bc ) and very different feelings ... 
  a good number of people believe that there is a paedophile ring in lithuania involving politicians and high profile civil servants . 
  it all started with [ this high-profile case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/case_of_dr%c4%85sius_kedys ) . 
  a father gunned down two officials for allegedly molesting his 4-year-old daughter . 
  a lot of people called him hero . 
  and a lot of people called him delusional alcoholic . 
  and then the main people involved in this case ( on both sides ) mysteriously died . 
  and then there was a custody battle between girl 's aunt and her mother . 
  here 's a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxgvaqj-8am ) of a `` simple and smooth '' custody transfer . 
  it all started in 2008 and ended in 2012 . 
  the majority of the public already forgot the case but i still semi-regularly encounter people talking about paedophiles in the government . 
  various conspiracy theories regarding deaths of everybody involved are popular too . 
   how do suvalkie\u010diai feel about suwa\u0142ki ? 
  nobody associates suvalkija with suwalki anymore . 
   plz do n't invade . 
  oh , sorry , but we [ already are ] ( http://www.financialobserver.eu/poland/many-lithuanians-prefer-to-shop-in-poland/ ) invading ... 
   but i actually do n't know if we have any others that became even somewhat popular ? 
  are you serious ? 
   [ saturnus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwl5mlsji4 ) is my second favourite band . 
  and very popular in general . 
  well , at least everybody even remotely interested in doom metal knows [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f1d_x6hfmc ) . 
  also , what about classics - king diamond / mercyful fate ( that 's really something to be proud of ! ) . 
  and do you remember [ this meme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq2pqm6fqvy ) from early 2000 's ? 
  it 's danish band iniquity  a lot of people like illdisposed . 
  and although [ nortt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpnfgprny6k ) are n't particularly popular , quite a lot of people i know like this band too . 
  technically there are [ 5 ethnic regions ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/etnoregionai.png ) , associated with different dialects . 
  lithuania itself has 4 of them . 
  * samogitia * : very stubborn , reserved , introverted , tough character , taciturn , hard-working , slow , patient . 
  * suvalkija * : frugal , miserly , prudent , cautious , smart-ass . 
  * dz\u016bkija * : open , friendly , sincere , hospitable , merry , sensitive , vibrant . 
  in folklore , auk\u0161taitians were associated with openness , lyricism and melancholy . 
  but these stereotypes did n't survive to this day . 
  they 're my favourite band of all time , in any genre !, 
  the best thing about them is that each album is very different . 
  you can get everything from dark pop to black metal and it does n't get boring ( i 've been a fan for 13 years ) . 
  their concerts are awesome too . 
  if i were living in portugal , i 'd probably spend all my money on their shows , 
  pentagram 's [ for those who died alone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np2bnjbtvno ) is one of the most beautiful instrumental songs i 've heard in this genre . 
  what is `` good '' for you ? 
  what 's your favourite subgenre ? 
  i would recommend you give a listen to these : 1 ) [ obtest ] ( https://youtu.be/tr0yv3yxuta?t=651 ) - pagan metal . 
  probably the most well known band outside our country . 
  listening to their records is fun ( if you understand the lyrics ) and i like them a lot . 
  seeing them live ... not so much ... 2 ) [ ghostorm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lfnk8j8c9u ) - technical death metal . 
  they were famous in the 90 's . 
  all the foreigners loved them . 
  i personally could n't get into them , so i 'm linking their only ballad instead , where ** dan swan\u00f6 ** ( !!! ),
