  did the vocals . 
  3 ) [ dissimulation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tag9mnd2sxk ) - thrash / black metal . 
  one of my favourite songs . 
  so much drive . 
  4 ) [ mandragora ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avtrxdnqhkk ) - melodic death metal . 
  they have a lot of catchy tunes . 
  i 'm linking this particular song because of [ this video that went viral ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ycpxxj9ax0 ) some years ago . 
  they were n't able to live it down . 
  5 ) [ meressin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kizdp4xporo&amp;t=37 ) - black / heavy metal . 
  not their best song , but i love their northern samogitian dialect . 
  i am samogitian myself but still ca n't understand the vast majority of the lyrics . 
  they sound somewhat barbaric . 
  and that 's what i like in my pagan metal . 
  6 ) [ ruination ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drwfbxbr95g ) - melodic / gothic metal . 
  i loved their early work . 
  the songs were melodic and the vocals were calming . 
  7 ) [ luctus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jtmbdnhogm ) - black metal . 
  i like them . 
  most of their newer songs have thrash metal influences and a lot of drive . 
  this one is slow and melodic . 
  skip to ~ 6:30 in the song and you 'll hear a lovely vocal part ( about war and death ) done by the frontman 's 6-year-old sister  8 ) [ pergal\u0117 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gys-uxwqag ) - depressive black 'n' roll . 
  this one is not for everyone - only for connoisseurs . 
  they 're a local phenomenon and crowd favourites . 
  they 're fun to listen if you like bands like * lifelover * . 
  [ white stork is official ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_symbols_of_lithuania#birds_and_animals ) national bird ( since 1973 ) . 
  [ forest of the gods ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17372568-forest-of-the-gods ) is the first that comes to mind . 
  but it 's considered a classic and liked by everyone . 
  a more recent work of literature that i enjoyed was [ silva rerum ] ( http://www.sabaliauskaite.com/index.php?page=2 ) series . 
  but it 's translated only to latvian and polish - no english translation yet . 
  a facebook page similar to the polish and czech ones - [ kol\u016bkinis barokas ] ( https://www.facebook.com/kolukinisbarokas/ ) ( `` kolkhoz baroque '' ), 
  i think the most famous serial killer in the true sense of this word was [ antanas varnelis ] ( https://serialkillersoflithuania.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/varnelis2.jpg ) . 
  back in 1992 , during a period of 6 months , travelling on foot , he killed 6 people ( and seriously wounded / attempted to murder 3 more ) in western lithuania . 
  he mostly killed old people in rural areas ( and sometimes slept in their homes afterwards ) . 
  he was caught by local people in one village , when they recognized his tattoos that were described in media . 
  he was sentenced to death by shooting ( back then we still had capital punishment ) . 
  ------------------------------------------ and do hitmen with possible mental disorders fit your bill ? 
  because [ romas zamolskis ] ( http://g1.dcdn.lt/images/pix/romas-zamolskis-68814404.jpg ) to me is one of the most fascinating personalities among contemporary lithuanian criminals . 
  there is n't much info on him in english , i 'll try to give a short summary : - he killed somebody in 1993 . 
  three months later he tried to steal weapons from a police shooting range . 
  he successfully resisted arrest , an officer was wounded in the shootout ; - committed various crimes ( robberies , suspected murders ) until 1994 , when he was arrested in an ambush . 
  after psychiatric evaluation he was announced a schizophrenic and therefore incompenent to stand trial . 
  he spent time in various mental institutions until 2000 ; - committed at least 2 heists , 2 attempted robberies and 3 murders in lithuania in 2001 , wounded at least 4 police officers and 2 security officers in various shootouts , escaped police anti-terrorist operations unit at least one time ( with some hostage drama ) ; - was caught in 2001 , and again , after psychiatric evaluation was diagnosed with mental illness ( he gave ambiguous answers to the doctors and officially denied his illness during the whole process of evaluation ) ; - afterwards he escaped mental hospital using cleverly fabricated documents ; - nobody could find him because , as it turns out , he was an expert in changing his appearance , acquiring fake documents , stealing guns and evading capture ; - there was an investigation in him being the hitman responsible for a murder of a famous lithuanian gang leader in 2001 ( with a stolen sniper rifle ) ; - in 2002 he robbed and wounded somebody in lithuania and then went to russia where he `` worked '' with various gangs for more than 10 years ( heists , roberries , weapon thefts , etc. ) . 
  killed at least 10 people as a hired hitman ; - was regarded in russia as one of the most notorious hitmen . 
  escaped the police numerous times . 
  it is rumored that he carried a grenade on him at all times ; - lived in a rural village in russia with a fake identity and a family ; - in 2011 he escaped an ambush by spetsnaz near his house ( car chase and some knife fighting ) ; - he was finally caught in russia in 2014 . 
  currently he is serving his sentence in a russian prison ; - he now officially claims that he undergoes severe physical torture by other inmates due to him being a lithuanian ( which might or might not be true ) . 
  i would love to have a book or at least a hollywood movie about this guy . 
  books : the count of monte cristo / edmond dant\u00e8s . 
  easy to explain - calm , calculating , intelligent . 
  a good person in general but does n't forget his past or forgive his enemies . 
  tv : for me it 's hands down [ ling ling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwzpnvrwweg&amp;t=34 ) from * drawn together * . 
  and this one i ca n't explain ... 
  i automatically read it in the voice of [ vinnie jones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inkmg9cckqw&amp;t=41 ), 
  i thought it 'll be easy to answer that question , but it was n't ... like latvia and estonia we have rich song festival culture , many folk revival ensembles , etc. 
  but not everyone is into folk music . 
  you asked for songs that * everyone * knows and could recite spontaneously . 
  and such songs are usually remade countless times into cheap pop , a kind of local `` turbofolk '' , mainstream `` metal '' , sports chants and drinking songs . 
  they became so trite and overused that only foreign ensembles and some struggling countryside orchestras still sing them as folk . 
  otherwise they 're just ... 
  i do n't know ... memes or some pop culture phenomenon . 
  so , sorry in advance , none of my links will sound as `` proper '' folk songs ( but believe me , they are , i just could n't find better versions ) : 1 . 
  [ balnokit , broliai , \u017eirgus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbukfpikwsy ) . 
  a war song . 
  extremely popular during sports matches ( usually before the match ) . 
  [ ant kalno m\u016brai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcvkasp-egi ) . 
  another song ( even more ) used by sports fans . 
  everyone knows at least the first 30 seconds of it . 
  it 's often sung if our team wins . 
  a folk song about unrequited love . 
  often sung when older people are drinking / partying ( but almost everyone regardless of age knows the words ) . 
  [ alaus alaus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit1qvo_umu ) . 
  folk song about drinking beer . 
  sometimes sung when younger people are drinking / partying ( made mainstream by the band i linked ) . 
  [ \u017dem\u0117j lietuvos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwh_fvqvnbc&amp;t=39 ) . 
  about our beautiful land . 
  sung by * everyone * in * every * event that has even a slighthest hint of patriotism . 
  [ example 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2oowwbbcuy ) , [ example 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsf4hmbz-ym&amp;t=6 ) , [ example 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n07sn8lnw9k&amp;t=11 ) . 
  our conservative party ( homeland union ) cleverly made it into their official anthem and now gets `` karma points '' everytime . 
  a young new devil starts working his first day in hell . 
  an old devil , his mentor , shows him around . 
  the whole workplace is a huge room full of pots boiling over a hellfire . 
  in each pot there 's a group of people - condemned souls suffering their eternal torment . 
  the old devil explains : `` see this first pot ? 
  you should always give your full attention to it . 
  it 's full of jews - whenever one of them tries to escape and succeeds to climb out , he always helps the other ones to escape as well . '', 
  then he gestures towards a second pot : `` see this one ? 
  you can check on it sometimes , but it does n't require much attention . 
  it 's full of russians . 
  once in a while a random guy climbs out , but he just goes to buy some vodka and comes back in . 
  the rest of the time they 're too drunk to escape . '', 
  then he shows a third pot , far away in the corner : `` and that one - you can just forget it , it 'll be alright . 
  it 's full of lithuanians '' . 
  the newbie asks : `` why , do n't they ever try to escape ? '' . 
  the old one replies : `` well , some are trying all the time . 
  but whenever one of them begins to climb out of the pot , the other ones immediately pull him back in '' . 
  *** according to the survey conducted by the department of statistics of lithuania , six out of ten lithuanians are living in deep depression . 
  and the other four are living in london . 
  it depends of your interpretation of `` non-touristy '' . 
  the first thing that comes to mind is the [ hill of crosses ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kryziu+kalnas&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj9-7rz0phsahvi_swkhwqtb70q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1146&amp;bih=673#tbm=isch&amp;q=hill+of+crosses ) . 
  it constantly makes various internet listicles as one of the `` top 10 most bizarre places in the world '' or something like that .
