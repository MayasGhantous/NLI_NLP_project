  it 's worth visiting , does n't matter if you 're religious or not . 
  but it 's usually well out of the way for most foreign tourists ( with pilgrims being an exeption ) . 
  [ rum\u0161i\u0161k\u0117s ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=rumsiskes&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewierjst1zhsahxcpzokhafxcjuq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1146&amp;bih=673#tbm=isch&amp;q=rumsiskes+buities+muziejus ) is an ethnographic museum with buildings from all the ethnographic regions of lithuania . 
  it holds the best mardi gras celebration in the country . 
  i personally like nature , smaller authentic villages and hill fort mounds , so i prefer hiking / biking in southern and eastern lithuania . 
  very much recommended is driving by car alongside neman river - a historic route , the line of defense at the time of northern crusades . 
  there is a number of [ manors and castles ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=panemunes+pilys+ir+dvarai&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;biw=1146&amp;bih=673&amp;noj=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewikpuw83jhsahwyzpokhsgxdzeq_auiccgb ) to visit on this route . 
  [ one of them ] ( http://www.15min.lt/pasaulis-kiseneje/galerija/panemunes-pilyje-ne-tik-muziejus-bet-ir-viesbutis-93237#galerija/93237/2221919 ) was recently named as one of the best castle-hotels in europe by the independent . 
  still , it lacks foreign visitors . 
  [ `` lithuanian venice '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=minijos+kaimas&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewja28ry3zhsahxlbzokhrhsbz4q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1146&amp;bih=673 ) and [ curonian spit ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=ventes+ragas&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewioybvi3zhsahvevywkhq9fb74q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1146&amp;bih=673#tbm=isch&amp;q=kursiu+nerija ) are often enjoyed by locals but overlooked by foreign tourists . 
  a canoe trip through [ samogitia ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=ventes+ragas&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewioybvi3zhsahvevywkhq9fb74q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1146&amp;bih=673#tbm=isch&amp;q=dubysos+slenis ) could be nice too . 
  or one could ignore it all and take one of the [ beer tours ] ( http://www.alutis.lt/alaus-turizmas/beertourism-en.php?id=full ) in northern lithuania . 
  the problem is , that the average mainstream tourist takes a weekend trip to visit all 3 baltic countries at once , rushes through their capitals and goes home . 
  that 's because a guy won a court case because of it in 2005 . 
  since then it 's illegal to use this name in sample forms . 
  til `` hessisches plusquamperfekt '' is a thing . 
   isch h\u00e4ww es ding schon vor jahre uffn schbeisch\u00e4 geduu gehabbd whatever , i would nail it after 12 beers . 
  as for almost everyone in this thread , the biggest problem for me are the tenses and adjective endings . 
  at first , i hated german tenses with all my heart . 
  then i started learning english and realised that it could be worse  still , i do n't think i ever used plusquamperfekt after finishing secondary school . 
  passiv for me seems fairly easy in english but i struggle with it in german . 
  deutsch war gelernt worden . 
  when i think about these structures , my brain goes [ like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xshp57m86_a ) . 
  when speaking , i can not pronounce some of the sounds ( for example `` r '' in `` richtig '' ) . 
  whenever i try to pull off the `` correct '' pronunciation , the germans do n't understand me at all . 
  i just stopped trying and now speak with a stereotypical eastern european accent ( everybody understands everything just fine that way ) . 
  the other thing is , that germans , upon hearing a strong accent , usually reply in english instead . 
  and that severely hurts my confidence . 
  sometimes , if i have to converse with a german , i use english outright ( that way we both are speaking a fremdsprache ) . 
  the result of this is that i 've lost nearly all my language skills now ( german was my second language back in the day - not anymore ) . 
  i do n't think that i have one favourite song . 
  but if i must pick one , i 'll go with [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh-iytk7ims ) because i 've seen it live countless times and was never disappointed . 
  here is a little summary of our family friendly and politically correct carnival called [ u\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u%c5%begav%c4%97n%c4%97s ) . 
  we dress up as [ gypsies ] ( http://www.tv3.lt/uploads/datawww/02/16/u%c5%begav%c4%97n%c4%97s_px600.jpg ) , [ jews ] ( http://www.diena.lt/sites/default/files/styles/940x000/public/vilniausdiena/vartotoju%20zona/a.smoliene/img667980.jpg?itok=lkovgqk3 ) and [ hungarians ] ( http://www.menufaktura.lt/images/structure/pictures/63531_th_uzga100214d2.jpg ) to beg for money , pancakes or sweets . 
  we [ crossdress ] ( http://alkas.lt/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/uzgavenes-2-12.jpg ) too . 
  also we always cheer at a beating of a [ fat man ] ( http://old.vilkaviskiopasaka.lt/images/uzgavenes%20\\ ( 11 \\ ) . jpg ) . 
  and then we burn [ a woman ] ( http://alkas.lt/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/picture-1196.jpg ) . 
  this year it 's in february , come visit , it 's fun , 
  i know i 'm late but still , i took a challenge to take a look at my playlist and pick one song i listen to the most for every european language ( if i have one ) .

  especially for songs in languages i have n't listed here . 
  my favourite is this one tough [ pony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bdemaitukas ) . 
  one of the oldest breeds in europe , can endure lots of [ crazy stuff ] ( https://2000kmhistory.wordpress.com/2010/10/17/2000-km-of-history-equestrians-let-their-zemaitukai-horses-drink-from-the-black-sea-video/ ) . 
  i guess they know their target audience [ very well ] ( https://polsy.org.uk/stuff/ytrestrict.cgi?ytid=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3d1il3rfk5okw ) . 
  yes , i know what you mean ( and ca n't see the reason why somebody downvoted you for your opinion )  4 years ago she was like a fresh breeze in our pop music scene because we simply did n't have what you call `` typical millenial '' music . 
  but it can get boring pretty quick ( in my subjective opinion , that is ) . 
  still , she 's way better than the majority of our pop artists . 
  but then again , i 'm not a big fan of mainstream pop music in general . 
  i think [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiqr0b7jv2c ) was pretty much the only mainstream pop song from my country that i really liked in the past 5-6 years . 
  according to radio charts , [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ctudtfor0m ) was played the most last week . 
  according to my youtube recommendations , [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sktbnjhkgfu ) is currently trending on youtube ( although the view count begs to differ ) . 
  nice !, 
  it turns out they had something in common after all  i thought she was a simple , typical pop star . 
  it 's illegal to sell [ energy drinks ] ( http://www.nutraingredients.com/regulation-policy/what-if-the-eu-banned-energy-drink-sales-to-under-18s ) to anyone under 18 . 
  traditional : [ k\u016b\u010diukai ] ( http://www.drfoodblog.com/index.php/2011/12/19/lithuanian-christmas-eve-biscuits-kuciukai/ ) soaked in milk of the poppy ( it sounds like something from grrm book , but it 's [ real ] ( http://duonosirzaidimu.lt/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/kuciukai-aguonu-pienas-by-jurgita1.jpg ) ) . 
  it 's not well known outside our country , but [ 35400 results on lt google ] ( https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b&amp;biw=1209&amp;bih=662&amp;noj=1&amp;q=ramus+kaip+belgas&amp;oq=ramus+kaip+belgas&amp;gs_l=serp.12...0.0.0.8123.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.serp..0.0.0.e1cw2yieifs&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=dxiswithi9sv8wep5p7oaq ) should tell you something about its popularity . 
  the most convincing theory i 've heard about this saying is that it originated in the first part of 20th century ( interwar period ) . 
  when western part of the country ( samogitia ) imported a very strong , calm and reliable horse breed from belgium - [ ardennes horse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ardennes_horse ) for heavy work . 
  they gained good reputation very fast and the saying `` calm like a belgian horse '' became `` calm like a belgian '' . 
  yes , that 's exactly what i was trying to say . 
  sometimes i find it more convenient to have two separate words for `` daytime '' and `` 24 hours '' . 
  and if i 'd say `` i slept the whole day '' , would english speaking person first presume that i slept for 24 hours , or just from sunrise till sunset ? 
  i know what you mean . 
  we have the word `` pirkia '' for this `` peasant house '' . 
  it would make sense that finnish `` pirtti '' could be more related to lithuanian `` pirkia '' than `` pirtis '' . 
  but no , according to danish linguist [ vilhelm thomsen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vilhelm_thomsen ) , `` pirtis '' -  `` pirtti '' . 
  it would be interesting to know how , when and why the finns associated baltic sauna to peasants . 
  the obvious one would be [ `` knygne\u0161iai '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) . 
  because of the historical context , this word has no direct translation to any other language . 
  you can translate only the context / description ( `` book smugglers '' ) . 
  the much simpler word that i miss in english often is `` para '' ( day + night , 24 hours ) . 
  i 'm sure that many languages have this [ edit : by `` this '' i mean two separate words for `` daytime '' and `` 24 hours '' ] , but english for some reason does n't ( at least i do n't know it ) . 
  it 's not so convenient to say , for example `` i have n't slept in 24 hours '' ( sounds very official ) , `` it was raining for 3 days straight '' ( but it was raining at nights too !, 
  ) , `` i worked around the clock '' ( could be just one word instead of three ) . 
  i would n't be surprised if it actually is a loanword taken from baltic languages . 
  it makes sense that words for thematically related things have the same source . 
  and linguists are certain that a lithuanian word for `` sauna '' ( `` pirtis '' ) came to finnish language ( `` pirtti '' ? ) . 
  just like lithuanian has a few finnish loanwords that relate to ships and sailing ( `` ship '' = lith . 
  = `` laiva '' ; `` sail '' ( piece of cloth ) = lith . 
  `` bur\u0117 '' , fin . 
  if i must name modern day countries : cultural perspective - [ non-european russia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsna3p-mhxu ) . 
  the far east , different peoples of central and northern asia . 
  and historically at the moment i 'm interested in [ sudan ] ( https://youtu.be/b86xe3tbxg0?t=29 ) . 
  how about some [ special forces ] ( http://www.15min.lt/images/photos/625174/original/lietuviu-aitvarai-paliko-neisdildoma-ispudi-amerikieciu-zurnalistei-5463843aef3ea.jpg ) ? 
  taken [ from an article ] ( http://www.aredrover.com/if-lithuania-entered-the-ukrainian-conflict/ ) by an american military inteligence officer . 
  i love it because of some nice quotes like :  mechanized horsemen of the apocalypse -- where they rode , death would come after and  if the rule was stupid , they did n't follow it . 
  their sense of independence , and unit autonomy drove many an american commander insane . 
  well , as i think about it , we have plenty of `` the slow estonian '' jokes , but no sayings / idioms / proverbs related to this stereotype . 
  probably even the common folk thinks that this stereotype is funny enough to make jokes but is n't based in reality enough to enter the folklore . 
  * p\u016bsti arabus * - `` to blow arabians '' ( `` blow '' as in `` wind blows '' ) . 
  meaning : to tell lies . 
  * rusi\u0161kas biznis * - `` russian business '' . 
  meaning : an unprofitable business transaction , a transaction without any business logic . 
  kaip \u017eydas prie vokie\u010dio * - `` q : [ hey , ] how are you [ doing ] ? 
  a : like a jew under the germans '' . 
  meaning : not very good . 
  meaning : being very calm , unconcerned , relaxed . 
  the saying is so common that even our ex ( impeached ) president used that phrase speaking in a [ foreign press conference ] ( http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=1528222 ) and subsequently had to explain himself to the belgian embassy .
