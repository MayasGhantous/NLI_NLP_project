you do n't . 
  it could lead to serious tongue injury, 
  sz-\u0161 cz-\u010d we had those too until xix century i think, 
  fuck german politicians . 
  blackmailing other countries . 
  i was always pro eu , but if this refugee bullshit is not stoping i think it is best for my country to leave this liberatarian dictatorship, 
  well then they are economical migrants and not refugees . 
  on 23 november 1793 the grodno sejm annulled all the enactments of the great sejm , including the constitution of may 3 , 1791 . 
  [ reciprocal guarantee of two nations 1791 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reciprocal_guarantee_of_two_nations ) * the document defined the * ** federal character of the state ** * and asserted the equality ( equal representation within bodies of state governance ) of its two constituents ( the crown of the kingdom of poland , and the grand duchy of lithuania ) *, 
  i am for the use of bilingual signs with polish majority or large minority , but i do n't think the original spelling in ids could work . 
  it would be really messy . 
  maybe additional line in the passport could solve this . 
  i really do n't understand why seimas could not come with a solution . 
  this was an issue for how long now ? 
  too long probably . 
  when this crap will end ? 
  good job estonia . 
  nice counter to our disgusting photos, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances * respect ukrainian independence and sovereignty and the existing borders . 
  * russia failed to do that, 
  in lithuania there is a ban on soviet and nazi symbol usage , so if anyone are using them , they are breaking the law and will face consequences, 
  the last one is estonian , cause it 's so damn slow, 
  we do n't have any, 
   listen to that crappy 1 hour 90s compilation above it can be used for criminal interrogation, 
  thanks,

  [ lithuanian pm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaxqrxrmxc4 ), 
  lithuania and estonia worse than greece . 
  germoney , please halp ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   we love estonia  those goddamn bastards . . damn them all to hell ... well that escalated quickly, 
  well if want to do that they will have to get some advice from fyrom first, 
  you ca n't win against troll using arguments so just forget about it, 
  we are not nordic , we are baltic . 
  we are observers in nordic council as well as latvia and estonia , but more years and generations are needed to wash away the soviet legacy and mindset of our people , as well as reach their standart of living , share their values with ours etc. 
  the cooperation between us and nordic countries , lets hope , will help us achieve it . 
  estonia is just too slow for live broadcast, 
  it is beautiful, 
  yes , please, 
  after 3rd basketball quarter the score between tallinn kalev and tartu rock is still 0:0, 
  i am frustrated now . 
  did not know such bullshit is going on, 
  manipulaton of polish minority is more likely, 
  i disagree . 
  i welcome you russians . 
  you can not judge the nation by the idiots who shout the loudest ( aka putin and the gang ), 
  and take some germans with you . 
  we need people, 
  do n't forget [ * liberium veto * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberum_veto ), 
  brace yourself , british replies are coming, 
  beautiful language for sure . 
  i would not mind, 
  i see gandalf, 
  [ hitler , referring to lithuania , stated that ' the lithuanians could be racially assimilated . 
  ] ( http://www.lituanus.org/1965/65_1_03_slavenas.html ) , better than slaughtered but still scary and crazy . 
  i do not know if nazis were better or worse for baltics , it is very complicated . 
  sure nazis did not deport more than 10 percent of baltic population however 250 , 000 baltic jews lost their lives . 
  we can all agree that both were the horror of europe, 
  lithuania is celebrating victory day on may 8th with other european officials , respecting all the soldiers and civilians that died in the war . 
  however lithuania is not participating in kremlin military parade , where the flag , of occupied crimea will be beared . 
  and of course lets not forget that for us it was not liberation it was another occupation, 
  it is worth to mention that the same move was made by ukraine and georgia, 
  yes pint is beer of volume 0,568 l people of the finland , what pint means in your language ? 
  i think he meant to say more archaic/conservative, 
  the number of lithuanians living in belgium must be enormous, 
  in lithuania after heavy drinking we experience state called ` autopilot ' . 
  it basically means that you do not need to worry about getting back , because one way or another you will wake up at home altough you wo n't remember how you managed to get there . 
  [ our flag was not supposed to have yellow colour ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vilnius_conference#/media/file:vilnius_conference_1917.jpg ) . 
  i really like your flag . 
  i do not like nordic cross idea , it is not what we were or are nowadays , altough it looks nice if we add our [ green , red and your white ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2741/4459930265_059a66c494.jpg ) . 
  or just lets go with good old vytis/pahonia, 
  our languages make lots of love, 
  lithuanians rejected khrushchev 's offer to place kaliningrad under lithuanian authority for the ethncal reasons . 
  i think it was a big mistake , because now we have a border with russia . 
  both words have letter m , duh, 
  russian people has nothing to do with this . 
  we were both victims of this totalitarian regime . 
  [ russian people showed only support when we needed it the most ] ( http://www.ekspertai.eu/static/uploads/cache/800x600/2013/01/maskva_1991.01.20-990x627.jpg ) by gathering in moscow to protest against violence in vilnius , riga , tallin . 
  he should 've taken him to the restaurant before grabig his crotch . 
  no wonder everyone is so mad . 
  probably yatsenyuk is very popular and there is big rivalry between those who wants to date him . 
  yup . 
  latvians and lithuanians decorated their homes with camouflaged swastikas for centuries http://ethnicshop.lt/media/wysiwyg/zirg4.jpg http://ethnicshop.lt/media/wysiwyg/zirg-255x224_1.jpg . 
  we are all nazis, 
  [ \u0160iauliai ] ( https://flagspot.net/images/l/lt%29sa-si.gif ) it was given to the city on november 9 , 1791 by the last king of the polish-lithuanian state stanis\u0142aw august poniatowski . 
  bear is the coat of arms of [ samogitia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samogitia ) [ the red bull was the symbol of coat of arms of the family of king stanis\u0142aw august poniatowski . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cio%c5%82ek_coat_of_arms ) [ and the eye was ideological symbol of the four year sejm . 
  sexy, 
  same in lithuania . 
  they cant tell the diffrence . 
  i think they are . 
  they are not the ones which come to the foreign country/contitent and demand the establishment of sharia law , refuse to acknowledge government superiority over religion , demand their neighbouring women to wear burkas , because they are too seductive , patroling streets and harassing citizens who does not act according to sharia . 
  hold massive demonstrations against our freedoms , insulting the country and authorities ( f.e. 
  police ) of the country they are living in and so on . 
  these are the problems which we already have with libertardian multiculturalism fairytale . 
  see like the so called refugees are acting when coming to europe . 
  going on the streets breaking everything , throwing out the food and water which are given to them . 
  fighting with police forces , assaulting people on the streets , chanting `` allahu akbar , fuck you '' and other phrases . 
  very civilized . 
  very similar to us .
