  at any time and in any place you could loose your life . 
  it will not get better . 
  politicians need to talk about islamic extremism , the islamic ghetos and about foreign funds to support islam . 
  refuge handling is also sad . 
  you cant accept everyone . 
  let saudis , oman , uae , qatar take some of their religion brothers . 
  europe by helping others is destroying slowly herself . 
  who is the troll with a fresh account afraid to write from his main account ? 
  and you are suddenly some sort of mental health expert ? 
  insulting just because i am acknowledging our history and expresing my point of view ? 
  i will not go any further in this conversation . 
  not worth my time and effort . 
  architecture , literature , music . 
  up until xx century we were basically one nation . 
  you ca n't deny this heritage . 
  it is common for both nations . 
  and a u turn made by our nationalist was absolute mistake . 
  ask anyone about f.e. 
  lithuanian composers . 
  everyone will only mention m.k. 
  this u turn in the interwar made other great our composers such as m.k. 
  history . 
  the union with poland brought to lithuania catholicism which basically meant influx of western culture to this region . 
  poland was our bridge to connect to the west . 
  if not this union we probably would 've been subjugated by russians or germans . 
  union prolonged the existance of grand duchy and made it less russian-like and more polish-like . 
  it is good that nowadays commonwealth heritage is becoming accepted as our own , but more effort is needed to dig out what was buried in the interwar and soviet times . 
  until xx century it was the good part and then mistakes were made from both sides and both countries/nations lost a part of each other . 
  if we disappear , we are draging you with us to hell, 
  i do not like this attitude of our colony .

  was it the only - stan in europe ? 
  somewhere i heard a theory that it may derived from a word [ g\u016bdus ] ( https://translate.google.com/#lt/en/g%c5%abdus ) . 
  there were a lot of forests in that area , and this word could be used to describe them ( g\u016bdus mi\u0161kas ) . 
  need a rope ? 
  all the questions are legit . 
  what the f. . . 
  jesus , estonia , calm down, 
  balto-slavic is a hypothetical same as italo-celtic . 
  there are no general consensus, 
  so why this scheme doesnt have italo-celtic, 
   most language groups are somewhat disputed . 
  f.e. ? 
  i can see clear similarity between latvian , lithuanian or german and swedish or polish and russian . 
  what is here to dispute ? 
   so they should n't both be among ie languages either ? 
  i did not say that . 
  i said that baltic and slavic are two diffrent language groups rather that the one group  no , because they have evolved separately from proto-indo-european , while the balto-slavic group separated before as a single group before it itself separated into the baltic and slavic groups . 
  so the proto-germanic and proto-baltoslavic split from each other around [ 3000 bc . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/indo-european_language_-_yamna-culture_-_3000_bc_-_map.jpg ) and the baltic-slavic split happened [ 2000 bc . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/indo-european_languages_-_expansion_2000_bc_-_map.jpg ) that makes them one group ? 
  pre-celtic and pre-italian is grouped in 3000 bc aswell . 
  this map should also group italo-celtic as one if we group balto-slavic as one  if i am supposed to see different alphabets and different vocabulary , then that 's not how you do linguistics ... then how do you do it ? 
  because italo-celtic is not grouped together, 
  nobody denies , that baltic and slavic share similar features , every ie family share some with one another . 
  they coexisted in the same region for thousands of years . 
  but dont you think that the diffrences are too big to put them in the same family ? 
  [ lithuanian ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/lithuanian/common/ ) [ samogitian ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/samogitian/common/ ) [ latvian ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/latvian/common/ ) [ polish ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/polish/common/ ) [ czech ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/czech/common/ ) [ russian ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/russian/common/ ), 
  i think its the other way around . 
  the grouping of baltic and slavic in the same branch is disputed . 
  you will find much more information about them being seperate language groups rather than the same, 
  it is disputed , it is written in the article . 
  and it is disputed for a good reason . 
  they are not the same group . 
  they are too diffrent . 
  maybe they have some similarities , but so does every ie language . 
  we do not put french and english in the same group lords prayer in slavic and baltic languages . 
  sorry , i do not see the similarities which could group these languages as one language group [ lithuanian ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/lithuanian/common/ ) [ samogitian ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/samogitian/common/ ) [ latvian ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/latvian/common/ ) [ polish ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/polish/common/ ) [ czech ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/czech/common/ ) [ russian ] ( http://www.krassotkin.ru/sites/prayer.su/russian/common/ ), 
  baltic and slavic are diffrent language groups . 
  they should not be branched together . 
  i heard somewhere that you can use that massive 1200 mah to start a diesel engine in the winter or use the flashlight for metal welding, 
   they * were very close friends .
