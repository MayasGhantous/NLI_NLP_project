  tv tower in my city is bigger than tv tower in his . 
  not to mention that finland and sweden are not only both european but also neighbouring countries , cultures are similar , many people speak both languages and it 's not hard to integrate even for the grown ups . 
  was swedish and norwegian but after starting learning swedish norwegian words started looking a bit weird . 
  i would n't call it sudden really , been seeing it for awhile now ... really funny though , at least for lithuania , one moment people try to look up to the nordics as in `` they 're proven to be the happiest people ; the life quality is so good '' and the other `` what i ca n't even slap my own child in sweden ? '', 
  i had a 2 day trip in latvia and expected to hear more latvian in the wild but was hearing so much russian , especially in riga :(, 
  vodka shot in a club in vilnius ~ 1eur m8 , i myself was surprised, 
  more info : you sell these kids to homosexual couples who ca n't have kids . 
  and why lithuanian kids and not roman ? 
  because lithuanians are educated and you want smart kids . 
  my dad actually half believes this shit ... and i 'm glad i left oslo exactly the day before they started protesting or smth because then i 'd maybe say `` poland '' when bartenders ask me where am i from :d, 
   there 's a pedophile lawyer ring controling lithuania 's judicial system . 
  that 's so 2013 . 
  i think there 's difference between inter-europe migration and when people completely unfamiliar to european culture w/o the desire to accept it move here . 
  earth is still overpopulated , mr. 
  single male . 
  lol what a cringey comment, 
   a door holding for a ** women ** and passing them ahead is a sign of good manners  no , it 's special treatment . 
  do it for people of random gender , then it 's polite . 
  and if someone tried to kiss my hand ... wtf seriously . 
  how about a handshake instead ? 
  what did i ruin ? 
  oh i thought you meant scotland and estonia are closer than other baltic countries . 
  my bad . 
  estonia is different from latvia and lithuania tho . 
  it might aswell be southern finland . 
  the northern the better . 
  lithuania is too close to the bible blob of europe to not be affected . 
  it 's not about `` the women '' not being horny enough , it 's probably about you being unattractive and casually sexist . 
  in terms of mentality lithuanians are not even close to the nordic people . 
  i mean sure , living in the nordic would be more than nice but having an article in the magazine about these pedestrian crossing signs in sweden which depict a woman figure crossing as one of the `` crazy feminist things in sweden '' is not how you get closer to the nordic . 
  norway was the first nordic country i 've ever visited . 
  it warmed my heart when none of the waiters in the eating/drinking places assumed that the norwegian guy i was with is paying for me . 
  finally a foreigner who understands !, 
  sweden is the best country in the world with snus , gender equality , k\u00f6ttbullar and all the other good things . 
  the language is so beautiful ( and the rest of the scandinavian languages too ) and the land reminds of my home just has bonus mountains , rocky hills and reindeer . 
  thank you russia for all the great sci-fi written before the 00 's . 
  the first ever real counter-strike : global offensive tournament with a big prize pool is happening in vilnius . 
  at first i was very hyped to go but now it seems pretty disappointing judging from the setup , price , people 's comments on the stream ( have n't seen it myself yet ) , overall quality . 
   all female units would probably would probably be great in certain roles tho , possibly even combat roles . 
  these were present in ww2 and i 'm not saying they 're a bad idea . 
  assuming most of the people are heterosexual it 's pretty clear how having mixed groups in the frontlines would reduce effectiveness . 
  in lithuania conscription applies only to men ( because we are backwards ) . 
  however just because i 'm not going to the military does n't mean i 'll bear kids , i 'd rather just shitpost on reddit for 9 months instead . 
  i 'm sure it applies for women europe-wide - having the ability to have kids does not imply they want to use it . 
  if one is capable or incapable for combat roles , they should get appropriate position regardless of their gender . 
  it 's noticeable but not to the point of being a language barrier . 
  except for samogitians , it kinda sounds like a different language ( they even have samogitian wikipedia and some want that region to be a seperate country lol ) . 
  once i was at a houseparty in plung\u0117 , consisting only of the locals and me . 
  for the first 30mins i felt like `` wtf wtf what am i doing here what are they talking about '' , but then i got familiar . 
  well that 's what i heard from other lithuanians :p i myself would say nicest people in the world are swedes and finns . 
  but i 'm quite a shut in and my socializing consists of coworkers and ~ monthly vacation trips to nordic countries ( as opossed to non-nordic countries ... ), 
  some people think swedes and norwegians have superiority complex but finns are cute , so maybe this . 
  people talk about it being a political statement while it really is n't anything political . 
  if you 're doing statistics of people who died by putting them as men , women and children i think the distinction is pretty easy . 
  same goes for the living . 
  except for the cases where a man has a said disorder , then he 's not a real man because in his head he can not contemplate his own sex . 
  but that 's why it 's a disorder . 
  psychological maturity is not objective . 
   a real man so literally every grown up male who has no gender identity disorder . 
  these are not personality traits and not what 3rd wave feminism is about . 
  pointing them out by itself is not sexist , just as it 's not racist to say that a black girl has a darker skin than me . 
  but making them important or relevant in some situations often turns out sexist . 
  also some of these biological differences that are being pointed out are often in fact not that biological . 
  3rd wave feminism by itself is just a set of ideas that your personality is not defined by your gender . 
  that 's example of how female -  male violence is perceived in the society , everyone . 
  i have n't seen any feminist women putting double standarts on this topic , i 've only seen multiple redditors wanting this to happen . 
  the women who think violence against men is okay are the same women who enjoy gender roles and `` traditional family values '' , not the ones who try to enforce gender equality . 
   we should be teaching women to be adults and ** men to be men ** what a gross expression . 
  everyone who 's a man is a man and everyone who 's a woman is a woman already , there 's nothing to `` learn '' about it . 
  edit : nvm , a peek into your comment history shows you 're a redpillar . 
  so , a lunatic . 
  the problem is that violence initiated by a woman is often laughed off and not taken seriously because `` men are stronger than women '' . 
  it 's socially acceptable to be a victim of violence from a man but not from a woman . 
  i 've done a `` social experiment '' once in a popular lithuanian board . 
  made a topic where i pretended to be a 24yo guy who lives with his girlfriend . 
  wrote a pretty typical `` i 'm being abused ( `` i '' said while arguing `` my '' gf often pushes me , if we 're in a public place she squeezes my hand hard and when `` i '' gave a ride home for a female coworker , she gave me a faceslap ) , is there a way to change it without breaking up '' , happily i did receive some answers like `` break up with her '' but many/most were `` ok so she 's not abusing you '' , `` just be careful to not die from that '' , `` i 'd do the same if my boyfriend was giving rides to some girls lol '' . 
  sexism is sad . 
  you 'll never go wrong by just giving a handshake instead . 
  just curious , why are n't you moving ? 
  it seems pretty common for lithuanians , lots of my friends moved to uk and especially london for their own reasons . 
   certainly seems they are n't too fond of lithuanians coming in if we take an average lithuanian , i 'm not surprised an average scandinavian would not be very welcoming tbh . 
  i do n't care about the 4chan and redddit memes and have a goal to move to sweden within 3 years due to the reason that i 'd really like to live there . 
  goodbye spaceboy :(, 
  not denying your comment but are you saying that mothers and daughters ca n't be nazis ? 
  exactly , the direction should be decrement of this information to women , not increment . 
  probably shitposting redditors . 
  fermented herring ? 
  it 's swedish but nobody eats it everyday . 
  not every swede is a desperate redittor who makes it all about `` the girls '' . 
  studying in romania while being a swede is a nice financial decision . 
  literally any topic can be made into something about the migrants here, 
  encountered that myself when was literally told that i wo n't be hired because they look for guys for that low grade low pay summer job haha . 
  well it should n't be . 
  in my country it 's still ok to discriminate against both . 
   with a caveat - you should be able to segregate based on physical abilities . 
  that 's of course . 
  and that 's the reason everyone is taking the tests . 
  just in some places it 's imo retarded that men and women take different tests - give the same ones and segregate people on that . 
  i 'm sure my mom would turn out a better foot soldier than my boyfriend , for example . 
   also , conscripted people should be used only for defense .
