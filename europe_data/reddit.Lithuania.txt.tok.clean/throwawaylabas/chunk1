i am lithuanian and we made a move to estonia also . 
  strong political will and decisions made in '90s shows results that are unparalleled by anything in the world today . 
  now it is just preposterous to say that we did it for better tax climate and lower wages , because wages are a bit higher in estonia compared to lithuania and difference in taxes is not significantly different in quantity , but quality . 
  it is not socialdemocracy vs neoliberalism , but incredibly smart and effective estonian government that just works . 
  if lithuania one day starts using [ xroad ] ( http://e-estonia.com/ ) we may move there if it is good for our customers and staff . 
  makes sense . 
  have heard this point of view . 
  in london where eastern european oligarch money freely accepted as clean and a toilet cleaner from eastern europe as filthy . 
  worker pays taxes , keeps the country going , corrupt money drives prices up making housing unaffordable , but in public opinion the worker immigrant is the bad one . 
  talk about doublethink . 
  upvote for bristol . 
  hopefully , it will float above all that other folk stuff . 
  diletant translation of mine : when the day comes and the war is over after losing yourself saw down to the very bottom hug me x3 so tender and do not let go hug me x3 your spring let arrive and so my soul puts the weapons down does it really want so much of warm tears ? 
  when you sing in a choire your heartbeat [ tends to syncronize with fellow singers ] ( http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleno/36412/title/choir-singers-synchronize-heartbeats/ ) . 
  not strange that [ big things then happen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singing_revolution ) . 
  also we could add that anti-polish sentiment in the region in that time is largely connected to blunders and major fuck-ups of policy of polish interwar republic : instead of a strong uniting point it became a dividing force . 
  next http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%9awinouj%c5%9bcie_lng_terminal, 
  it did take only vocabulary into account , [ source ] ( http://linguist.univ.kiev.ua/museum/book/index.html ) . 
  well everything you wrote is true for almost every european language except maybe the tatar part . 
  also being linguistically monolithic and isolated was/is a thing for some time in moscow history . 
  i guess this got reflected in the chart . 
  edit : also borrowing from it english is not as massive in russian , as in other european languages , e.g. 
  genius !, 
  i guess wodka is the biggest influence in language evolution here . 
  in methodology they did not include grammar , it is only vocabulary . 
  of course everyday words in romanian and italian are mostly the same , but in those rarely used words , there is wast plains of borrowed words from neighboring languages . 
  i think he meant our mutual unfriendly neighbor . 
  if there is anything that throws a shadow on polish contemporary politics is lack of leadership in region and chronic ignorance of shit their allies are going through . 
  poland is like polandball 's us of eastern europe . 
  / joke, 
   weird for someone speaking polish , educated in poland and consumming polish culture to call himself `` lithuanian '' but if educated in lithuania , speaking polish in kresy dialect , being part of polish literary tradition , consuming and creating polish culture is not weird at all . 
  maybe that is why i did not understand why it was `` fair enough '' . 
  there is no problem in lithuania to get education from kindergarten to masters degree ( with some limitations ) totally in polish . 
  about that ethically centered nation ( like modern poland ) , i do not think that was the original idea not because it was impossible practically , but because i do not see imperial thinking in peasant language oriented national awakening movement ( namely lithuanian ) . 
  thanks for a nice discussion . 
  you really opened my eyes on something . 
  just interesting that six centuries ago polish would be surprised and look down ( maybe with suspicion ) on lithuanian nobility wanting to fraternize with them . 
  five centuries later national revival idea was a lot more inclusive , so the problem just is upside down . 
  funny part that there is a problem , because i did not understand your comment on `` well enough '' . 
   that does n't mean they have felt any connection with some baltic language speaking nation state calling itself `` lithuania '' i am sure we both agree , more ethnically centered republic of lithuania is a result of failure in lietpol relationships , you know , all [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proclamation_to_the_inhabitants_of_the_former_grand_duchy_of_lithuania ) and [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_of_riga#treaty_aftermath ) . 
  also saying , that it was only lithuanian speaking is simply not true as jewish and german input in securing independence can not be overstated . 
  yes , it was built as a capital of a large realm , where jews , germans , tatars , armenians , scottish , french and italians have left their mark . 
  i speak polish and am a lithuanian , so what ? 
  i think that polish being lingua franca and language of culture and education for so long is an achievement already , no need to start arguing who built what . 
  i think what rzeczpospolita can teach us is that strength is in unity and diversity , and weakness is in stupid quarrels over nothing really . 
  very good point . 
  and if one accepts every opinion as equal in value and use it as a way of validating a position , that actually makes one closed minded . 
  closed or open mindedness can not be a criterion of estimation in an argument , because it is connected with truthiness of the very fact of different opinions . 
  we are .

  theodor tyutchev once wrote that [ one is not able to grasp russia with brain ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a3%d0%bc%d0%be%d0%bc_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d1%8e_%d0%bd%d0%b5_%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bd%d1%8f%d1%82%d1%8c ) , a phrase expressing supposed irrationality of `` russian soul '' that now has become a popular maxima , a butt of jokes , overused for propaganda purposes , so has a lot of interpretations like this one : \u041f\u043e\u0440\u0430 , \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 , \u044f\u0434\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c , \u0423\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044e \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c it 's about f ** ing time , my friend , to start understanding russia with brain already . 
  extremally relevant comment !, 
  / s p.s. 
  just for you i made a schema of logic in your conversation : a. 
  who is x ? 
  b. x is a boogieman responsible for all the problems . 
  / s c. x is not responsible for all the problems . 
  x is responsible for \u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b4 . 
  b. x elected the presidents . 
  / s / a sarcasm is a nice way to evade conversation , because you do not have to engage or answer , but stay in self built universe of sarcasm and absurd . 
   no knowledge about the track record he spoke off i thought he was being sarcastic and wanted to drop a british joke about surrender monkeys . 
   at the time the deal was concluded [ somebody ] ( https://www.oxan.com/display.aspx?itemid=db159233 ) told it was a bad idea ( sorry ), 
   we present opportunities for growth if you 're willing to ~ ~ learn our language and respect our nation ~ ~ be respectful to other people as equals . 
  edit : producing quality content in russian that is not propaganda is good enough , benefits everybody and there no need to make it look as ethnic strife with holding grudges ( the undemocratic side does good job on that already ) . 
  language and nation is irrelevant , when russians feel safer living outside russia it shows we are doing something right that russia is n't , better more russians know that . 
  i liked the link , but disagree with your conclusion . 
  should i upvote or downvote ? 
  so did estonian president https://twitter.com/ilvestoomas, 
  i am not sure whether as a perceivably gangster town kaunas is mocked more , that for example panev\u0117\u017eys or \u0160iauliai , but for sure there are a lot of jokes about suvalkija being cheap , and arguably longer and has factually greater cultural weight . 
  sorry , mate , the european military project is pushed by anti-american sentiment and wish to diminish nato ( which is glued by us ) influence in the continent . 
  european military idea comes from french-german projects and is opposed by uk ( as a strongest us ally ) and 2004 enlargement countries ( that are worried about security ), 
  you make an assumption that somebody is discriminated against or does not have the same rights as the rest , it is just factually not true : everybody is equal under the rule of law . 
  another assumption is that you suggest assimilation , which is another scare tactic used when any attempts to facilitate integration are seen as a forceful assimilation . 
  if there are any real ( not imaginary ) problems , then it is the nature of so called russian minority advocates is their asocial tendencies and contempt towards open democratic society with politeness and tolerance , exactly the ideas created by kremlin propaganda . 
  so you suggest ethnic cleansing ? 
  ridiculous btw , during breakup of ussr it was popular to scare russian speaking population with deportation to convince not to support democratic changes . 
  there are no facts that would support claim that they even aimed at military targets . 
  the system was modified to actually hit a commercial air liner . 
  http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/nalyvaychenko-said-that-separatists-intended-to-shoot-down-russian-passenger-plane-359765.html usually military planes do not anounce their flight schedule when going over unsecure region , and the missile was fired at exact first technically possible moment , showing that it was planned to take down a boeing . 
  edit : huello downvote bots !, 
  he is just an opportunist , using putin propaganda to make an opposition to democrats . 
  that way he does not have to do any intellectual work apart repeating kremlin bullshit . 
  their propaganda is of better quality , than anything we have ever seen . 
  there is a great chance you have heard some of that , and believed it . 
  take ukrainian crisis portrayed in the western media ... hardly laughing and having popcorns , but believing and actively spreading further, 
  romans buying amber for fancy golden coins . 
  yeah you just pick a rock up of the ground and get a full sack of gold . 
  yeah guys kept it in big jugs and burried for us to find in a backyard . 
  good job !, 
  the period called the golden age of baltic archeology because of numerous artifacts and seeming progress of culture . 
  also raiding the north for some reason . 
  i do not thin she targeted it specifically on france , but on eu as a whole . 
  today we face an ultimate test of survival of european union as a political body . 
  schr\u00f6der was an example of strategies to jeopardize economic convergence , when selling cutting edge ** attack ** ships is an example of a lack of solidarity in defense . 
  to put it into a perspective , if russia had these ships in 2008 , the war would last 18 hours instead of 5 days . 
  it is important only for a country , that is planing on invasion from sea . 
  not very useful for a country , that wants to defend it 's territorial integrity . 
  interesting part is that lifted iron curtain , not only let peoples from a jail of stalinism , but also gave wealth , power and freedom to evil that was ruling for decades . 
  who could predict this ? 
   not necessarily for the worse thank you for a brilliant response , i need a moment for this to sink in .
