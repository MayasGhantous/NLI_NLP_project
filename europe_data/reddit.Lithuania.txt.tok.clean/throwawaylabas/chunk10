  yes , [ a few ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_karaites#lithuania ), 
  and we are the northerners , right , we are calm and quiet to preserve the energy for the long winter : nobody would argue that somebody stole name of their country , history , flag , coat of arms or anything like macedonia . 
  right ? 
  when estonians called themselves after aestii ( probably batic speaking tribes from modern poland ) everything was chill .

  well , shit then , because only his heart is buried in rasos , the brain was given to vilnius university and disappeared soon after , and the rest of the body is in krak\u00f3w . 
  well , that would make an interesting rescue ... [ relevant on two dimensions ] ( https://xkcd.com/896/ ), 
  you polacy are all : gib gib gib ... daj daj daj mi to ... a my puliaki z wilni mo\u017cemy tyko posiuli\u0107 w mordu albo w rot posasa\u0107 : ddd / sorry jeszcze w\u00f3dka nie skwa\u015bnia\u0142a , p\u00f3ki my \u017cyjemy / sorry again, 
   the baltic states -- lithuania , latvia , and estonia -- officially call their time within the soviet union a `` soviet occupation '' and all have since joined both the european union and nato . 
  `` their time in soviet union '' . 
  i guess some countries were `` doing time '' as in jail of nations . 
  | wilno , grodno , lw\u00f3w has notable polish influences with architecture typical for this region this is the region , that was the centre ( both geographically and economically ) of rzeczpospolita life , that competed with krak\u00f3w warszawa more politically influential core . 
  this was the main reason for paradox of polish identity . 
  constructing modern lithuanian national identity was way easier and still has less hiccups . 
  the architectural influences you were talking about are italian . 
  there is no such thing as polish architecture from the time those cities were built . 
  rzeczpospolita was multicultural polity , that means there is no uniform `` polish '' traits you could identify . 
  warszawa and krakow has more central european ( czech , hungarian ... ) look in architecture , whilst the vilnius-horadnia-lviv core has different war history , differ the peoples that live there , and influences it gets , though the country is the same . 
  so there is no `` polish '' architecture from times we are talking about , because it would be an oxymoron . 
  barnevernet is tinhat staple all over eastern europe . 
  i believe it started in russia and then propagated to other eastern european countries in milder adoptions through pro-russian controlled conspiracy/yellow journalist media outlets . 
  original version is a bit more extreme : after stealing aryan < insert eastern european country name  kids , barnevernet must give them to gays/paedos for adoption to solve demographic crisis and have pure blond genes . 
  this more extreme version works in russia , because there are lots of abandoned kids . 
  some of them get adopted by americans . 
  there has been a number of stories how badly this went . 
  vilnius is located on the edge of lithuania , 30km from belarussian border and portugal being in the furthest part of europe . 
  the connection does not exactly sound intuitive or witty . 
  i do not know why this caught on . 
  bizzare meme . 
  i do not get why every lithuanian meet says e-stonia is just great marketing and good pr , but still envy them . 
  i see estonia as part of the region . 
  one is good at marketing , other at production and we have a good division of labour . 
  i tried reading what is written on the $ pig , that is unhappy with bear flexing muscles and does not have a note sticking out , hoping it is lithuania . 
  would be so in line with their porkpaganda . 
  hi is/was just an opportunist .

  cheepest or not , bought for own money . 
  while russia annexes the dumpster outside . 
  this is site around of xix century fortress , that was taken from the polish during the first month of wwii , then nazis and soviets had a parade together with swastikas and hammers and sickles , then nazis gave it to soviets until next year when they stopped being allies . 
  now it is a symbol of sacrifice of millions . 
  belarus has lost third of it 's population in this affair being in the middle of two gargantuan war machines that changed the sociopolitical , demographic and economic landscape of whole easterneurope beyond recognition , but hopefully not beyond repair . 
  looks like home,

  as the make of \u0420\u0411\u041c\u041a reactor . 
  a product is that majority of ukrainians changed their minds and now wish they had joined nato, 
  me too . 
  this eastern european as second class citizen is bs . 
  i do not think it to be derogatory , racist or insulting . 
  to be honest , i believe there are things to be proud about eastern europe . 
  this playing a victim should cease already . 
  estonia in many ways is more progressive and cool than nordics . 
  actually by area european russia + belarus + ukraine is bigger than eu . 
  you can say world regions have an urge to consolidate around one or other source of power . 
  the difference in opinions is on depth , breadth and the rules of power . 
  your post reminded me [ w.b.

  shit i hope somebody cheated , so i can put my eyes on something that is not embarrassing . 
  i laughed . 
  everybody laughed . 
  it worked methinks . 
  there probably is no direct proof of him working with kgb , but he definitely allied with communists from the getgo and had played many games within the old party to merge it with excommunists and gain more power . 
  and this divide is so visible , they still have words for `` new '' and `` old '' socialdemocrats . 
  it played well for him . 
  let 's face it he is sociopath just as hanibal lecter as you talk to his son you understand what is difficult childhood . 
  thank god there was not enough time as a minister to do more harm with `` back to past '' health reform . 
  i guess a perfect match to farage, 
  andriukaitis sounds as real baddass : growing up in tundra over arctic circle . 
  [ edited trashy journalism ], 
  indeed , the stories are so fucked up in so many levels so often when you look at it . 
   or rode a tank into prague actually , those were from kaunas , lithuanian ssr . 
  first a plane asked for emergency landing , then unmarked gunmen occupied the airport , tanks followed . 
  one of the guy told about the irony when czechs shout in slavic language `` russians go home '' and he would only think `` we are no bloody russians ! '' . 
  so yea , simplistic narrative does not do any justice . 
  no healing occurs , when one imagines martians or moon people committing the atrocities , neither it does when taking defensive positions . 
   recognize the crimes committed the only way that works,

  maybe i am giving too much attention to those points above comments , but the fact , that a response with a thought terminating clich\u00e9 or a copy-paste from wikipedia gets more upvotes is above me . 
  how is it relevant ? 
  if you would like to discuss what socialism is today , we have to have to define what are means of production in service and knowledge economy . 
  empirically , by your definition socialism would be if everybody would be self-employed , or worked in a company that has equity shared amongst employees . 
  hi , i see there is a misunderstanding , so let me try and explain what u/tyeckyech said by giving more context . 
  this user has a latvian flair , that means most probably has lived in a `` socialist '' country , therefore wary of ideologies . 
  btw , as everybody in ee does not believe in ideologies . 
  you can even say , that all ee parties are in a deep ideology crisis , where you can never place a party in a classical left-right political spectrum . 
  from what u/tyeckyech said also you can see , that he/she is aware of socialists in the west , who like to say that sssr is not a socialist , but state capitalist country , or have a discussion in defence of socialism that sssr was `` not real socialism '' . 
   rural kazakhs have much in common with the welsh and the kiwis [ ouch ] ( https://youtu.be/oce28vrfy7k?t=129 ), 
  i agree . 
  i thought about mutual edge of civilisation thing here . 
  plus that grumpy longing for something ... and after traveling through countries like italy , france , spain getting to portugal is like teleporting back home from some crazy party ( for an introvert ) . 
  i just did not know that many portugueses share the same sentiment . 
   and i do n't think poles have much in common with lithuanians . 
  i ca n't find a single thing in common aside from `` the commonwealth '' and sharing a border you must be kidding me . 
  really . 
  i was trying to imagine poland without the lithuanian part . 
  it was like separating brothers narutowicz . 
  taking lithuania out of poland is taking \u017bwirko out and letting wigura fly alone . 
  like what would mickiewicz call his homeland then ? 
  or what exotic language use to invent new names to call beautiful polish women ?
