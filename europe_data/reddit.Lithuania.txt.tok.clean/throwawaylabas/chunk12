  i guess for some following the fashion does work . 
  [ maybe ] ( https://s00.yaplakal.com/pics/pics_original/0/1/9/6964910.jpg ) it got boring when fake and so eagerly pushed ? 
  intuitively you start being repulsed by something , that is shoved down your throat . 
  when somebody with zeal and enthusiasm tries changing your mind for some reason , this is time become suspicious . 
  i will believe whatever i want and respect freedom of conscience of the other . 
  no ( fashionable/overzealous/brutal ) movement will change that . 
  sorry , ancient east slavic language naming and classification have as much baggage of power games and what not to be so confusing , that you can easily mix up two languages half a millennia and 2 thousand miles apart . 
  though it did have influence from old church language , but is not equal to it . 
  fun fact : this language is called so by lithuanian scholars only , the rest of scholars have their own naming conventions that are no less confusing ( because every country tries to make it look primum inter pares , with clear genealogy line ) . 
  english wikipedia called ruthenian , because it is language of ~ ~ ruth ~ ~ rus . 
  if you like diagrams [ here is one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_slavic_languages#/media/file:east_slavic_languages_tree_en.png ) explaining it all . 
  i remember modern belarusians reading statute of gdl and complaining that it is unintelligible and sounds like bad polish written in kirilica . 
  please edit . 
  old church slavonic ( 9th . .11 th century , dialect of old south slavic ) though sounds quite similar is from different language group than old chancellery slavonic ( 14th . .17 th centuries , high register language descended from ( old east slavic 10th . .13 th , native to rus ) ), 
  you must be from xvth century , sir . 
  now it ( russkaja mova ) is called old chancelery slavonic ( by lithuanians ) , old-ukrainian ( by ukrainians ) , old-belarusian ( by belarusians ) . 
  terms old russian and russian eventually got reserved to moscow dialect only and became a touchy subject . 
  thank you for your response . 
  yes , everything so nicely written by you is true and known . 
  but i wanted to ask something different : to clarify what [ u/h2ppyme ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/h2ppyme ) meant by saying :  political system known as `` poland '' was n't annexed i thought annexation was only concerned with territory , not political systems , therefore it sounds like something i have not heard before and may be a blind spot in my knowledge . 
  also it contrasted with language [ used elsewhere ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territories_of_poland_annexed_by_the_soviet_union#cite_ref-wettig47_33-2 ), 
  sovereignity . 
  the main difference . 
  polish peoples republic was an independent country ruled by communist party ( btw with the most freedom in warsaw pact countries ) . 
  oh , are you sure this is how it works . 
  could you please elaborate ? 
  ruble crisis has struck them stronger . 
  baltic countries just changed direction of exports , and they had around one third of [ gdp per capita of 1990 level ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:rus:chn&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:rus:ukr:blr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  except , those parts that are eastern lithuania , western belarus and western ukraine . 
  well it depends on how you look . 
  absolutely crazy, 
  i just know the moment where there was a vote on a law to bar from positions of power all the people with history of involvement in soviet rule . 
  also , i once met an soviet estonian clerk , who now worked as truck driver . 
  in lithuania if you were a kgb agent , you just have to declare it and this can only become a problem if you for some reason tried keeping it a secret , otherwise you are free to become a president or whatever . 
  i feel , that when you read soviets you see russians . 
  especially today , with all this gay thing . 
  but i do not think it has anything to do with russia . 
  originally , homosexuality was seen as communist thing . 
  soviet experience in traditionally orthodox country in quite spectacular fashion gradually transformed it 's social politics from left to right ( remember khrushchev calling abstract sculpture ` pydarasnia ` ? ), 
  as fas as i know , estonia desovietized it 's politics , so they do not have nomenklatura owning everything . 
  saying that something is soviet , makes it sound backwards , therefore shutting down opposition when trying a reform . 
  works with great results in estonia . 
  congratulations to them about that . 
  here we 'll argue for another decade and then try catching up with estonians . 
  again ... , 
   ukrainian are not refugee if they do n't claim the status and they do n't true . 
  because they want to work . 
  i like how your comment eschews the moral side of the question : does claiming for refuge status makes illegal migrant into a refugee ? 
  we had those same kind of `` refugees '' from lithuania how they sneaked into , say uk in 90s , by creating a story that somebody was endangering them at home , and stayed for years in the country , while application was in process , working illegally , odd sometimes criminal jobs , getting the social housing et al. 
  eastern europeans are mostly against this spread ( forceful resetlement ) of illegals , because we know what forces drives it . 
  those same reasons drives me rethink my career decisions . 
  forcefully resettled illegal will not stay in said estonian village , because he will see that life at home in sunny iran or morocco was better , and this seen just a minor setback , motivating to keep on trying reapply for refugee status in rich country . 
  those same reasons worked during migration periods earlier . 
  rule throughout the history : when a tribe of barbarians is not assimilated into social fabric of empire it will be part of the end for the empire . 
  i myself has been of the both sides can tell if you are not try learn and respect the host country you are just making a trouble for yourself and your host . 
  let me say , ukrainians are usually better migrants ( let 's not pretend they do not overstay , claim fake refugee status as everybody ) for precise the same reason . 
  they are ready to fight tooth and nail for european ideals . 
  we have seen them die with eu flags in their hands and here this means not only better standard of living , but rule of law and dignity of human being . 
  but the most important this drives them for a change , to become more european and they put the best into that ideal . 
  conclusion . 
  basically , the question here is how we name it and how we legalize/control/supervise migration in europe . 
  if we do not leave options for a migrant other than ask for refugee status , we are making people lie about their intent of arrival , while not helping neither refugees ( very few ) who are in danger , need active immediate action from state , neither displaced persons , nor migrants who have ( rightful and natural ) wish to have a way to search for a better life . 
  keeping everybody illegal , or calling everybody a refugee does not give justice to anybody . 
  claiming you are refugee when you in fact are not is not justice either . 
  making people call themselves refugees when you lost your house in a war or just do not want to live in luhansk republic is not dignifying . 
  let me give you two examples . 
  both great lads i know . 
  one is of a person my friend 's work . 
  his father being a superrich man in teheran , did not want to see his son working ( for some reason connected with prestige are richness ) , they had a quarrel , and the son after hearing about ` merkel invite ' left for germany , claimed for asylum , works illegally in iranian owned restaurant . 
  other person , whose family still lives in donetsk , he lives in krakow as a programmer , claimed for residence permit and says he is no refugee , because there is nothing stopping him to go home , this is his choice , for anything he likes to be seen as equal . 
  remember back then parts of russia was poland . 
  actually , rzeczpospolita was major exporter of live trained bears . 
  then it was a lavish extravagant choice for securing a palace : chain a bear near entrance , they would only let in people they know and maul anybody else . 
  like this fine exemplar from a [ flag of ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/flag_of_samogitia.png ) duchy of [ samogitia , as we know a part of poland ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ksi\u0119stwo_\u017bmudzkie ) . 
  as one may guess , feeding a bear is super expensive , and you need balls of steal to domesticate animal that can bite your head of , so a tradition did not survive . 
  there is a legend , nicely illustrating extent of this stereotype , that jadwiga before marriage tasked somebody to go to a sauna with jagie\u0142\u0142o and examine a common belief that his body of a bear and head of a human . 
  let me guess ... poland ? 
  now this one :  reigned by : does not matter . 
  [ after closer inspection ] ( https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/penguinsofmadagascar/images/9/95/kowalski_and_whiteboard.png/revision/latest?cb=20161111190954 ) , yes ireland 2009, 
  true , you are right , and yes it did ( in 1953 . .1990 ), 
  let me google that for you https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flags_of_the_soviet_republics#/media/file:flag_of_lithuanian_ssr.svg, 
  but ... upside down and five pointed golden star on bloody red background is just fine ? 
  you want to say you took our flag and put it upside down so you can have a five pointed star in a red background ? 
   reversed because of s. . . plus , scotland , wales and northern ireland as separate countries wow . 
  edit : may the honorable downvoter help out a confused lad , which flag of these is most similar : [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_lithuanian_ssr_ ( 1940-1953 \\ ) . svg ) [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_lithuanian_ssr.svg ) or [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/red_army_flag.svg ) ? 
  when the border we have in between has been the oldest political border ( not a natural one ) between two countries in europe . 
  what makes them stay in lithuania ? 
  usually they leave next day . 
  sadly , baltic countries are good folks in the eyes of brussels , accepting refugees that flee asylum next day , and poland that accepted over a million of actual refugees from actually war torn country are in the wrong , and merkel that invited all kinds of avanturistes without proper negotiation and procedures is somehow a saint . 
  i see how much work has been put into that . 
  the unexpectedness of actual parts of old soviet vehicles brought to life is comic . 
  for me zil already looked anthropomorphic, 
  nice pictures , but  percholate, 
  that may be true . 
  but what can we say about it ? 
  what does it mean ? 
  i do not really see what one gets from it . 
  honestly , i just do not care . 
  it even feels stupid discussing it . 
  i do not know if equal marriage is a good idea .
