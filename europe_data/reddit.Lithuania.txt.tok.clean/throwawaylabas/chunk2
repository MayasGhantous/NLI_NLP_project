   sarcasm not at all , i was surprised to see somebody go such a length just to try local beer , also quality of expression in that blog is outstanding as if that person is a real beer sommelier . 
  i am now even inspired learn some of this tasting art ... 
  personally , the lack of proper classification is the reason i drink belgian beer - it is everywhere , and i know what it is , while in every bar there is at least one local beer , there is such a variety of them , that you have to ask around , if you do not want accidentally to go from stout to ale ... 
   would dig out the german border [ chuckle ] ( http://satwcomic.com/border-control ), 
   sounds like `` chicken penis '' that is some important information here !, 
  i will try to remember this one . 
  wow , that was a great link you gave !, 
  just every time it was written , that somebody did not have a proper menu in english with descriptions , or staff did not speak languages made me die inside a little . 
  all breweries have no marketing strategy and it looks like they do not even try to sell , or explain what is it they are making . 
  imho , there is a need to classify the beers , so there would be some distinction between them , slogans , internet presence , i guess it is time to get to work on this tonight ... 
  nice to hear that . 
  also , there is a factor , that most of crippling effects of soviet rule and constant `` individual survival mode '' had negative effects on civil society , morality , culture , and those places , that suffered the biggest losses of life and infrastructure during and after wwii , later became the centers of support for soviet order , that lingers to this day and effectively is holding back whole countries . 
  i edited the post and added about importance of media : now the west starts to forget it and this is a bad sign , as russia has massive personnel from soviet times , that specializes in media ( `` enlightening of masses '' was single most important factor of stalinist communism ) , and this means , that they are probably acting when something distracting happens e.g. 
  baltic states were occupied the same day hitler took paris , 1991 soviet union tried to militarily keep the break away republics , while all the world was looking at kuvait , and 2008 georgian war started with opening ceremony of beijing olympics ( i was in paris that day myself , and the only reason i find out about this was a couple of my friends , with whom i had to meet there were stranded in tbilisi ) . 
  so it is basically not the weapons , but the eyes of international community , that can deter violence in this case . 
  actually , russia 's influence on european economy and politics is enormous : from [ gas price divide ] ( http://gdb.rferl.org/3dfd9930-33d5-4420-8805-7d9a0c7ae6ed_cx0_cy25_cw0_mw1024_s_n.png ) , enormous money for political bribery , corruption , information warfare ( budget for propaganda purposes in russia is bigger than a gdp of a small eastern european country ) , crippling economic influence of dirty big money from east ( like whole neighborhoods of west london are owned by somebody , driving the price up ) . 
  and it is not only cold war , but also second world war a very relevant and sensitive for present day , as you can see from kremlin mythology about ukraine . 
  about poland , at least in where i live , things changed drastically after [ smolensk plane crash ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash ) , as poland stopped trying to gather politically scattered region and lead it , but instead to join the club of strong and powerful * motors * to lead all europe . 
  that is probably the reason , those projects of european defense force are seen in negative light , as it would lessen importance of nato and ties with us , what is indeed attractive to germany and france , but catastrophic to some eastern european countries . 
  i am sorry , for long post , just wanted to share , the horror of seeing ukraine slowly retreating in the information war . 
  as we saw a fiasco of georgia in 2008 , ukraine showed to be better off for time being , but now the west starts to forget it and this is a bad sign , as russia has massive personnel from soviet times , that specializes in media ( `` enlightening of masses '' was single most important factor of stalinist communism ) , and this means , that they are probably acting when something distracting happens e.g. 
  baltic states were occupied the same day hitler took paris , 1991 soviet union tried to militarily keep the break away republics , while all the world was looking at kuvait , and 2008 georgian war started with opening ceremony of beijing olympics ( i was in paris that day myself , and the only reason i find out about this was a couple of my friends , with whom i had to meet there were stranded in tbilisi ) . 
  strange and eerie attractiveness of soviet project for some people could be maybe explained by lack of attractive alternative : average western european or american obviously do not understand eastern europe , it 's contexts , this war . 
  this is probably best illustrated by western media choosing to report events with far less casualties , or pistorius story ( with half an hour coverage ) proved to be an easy sell , while ukrainian war is probably less spectacular than israel-gaza , syria , football , or a sprinter who probably is easier to relate with for the viewers - hard to tell why , but today , 2014.07.14 there were no news on donbass-luhansk . 
  furthermore , it is far too obvious that sometimes for a western european , eastern europe is as far and exotic as cambodia , congo , south america : not even worth symbolic solidarity , or collective negotiation for gas prices . 
  actually even baltic countries sometimes look as living in different timeframe from point of view of ukrainians . 
  the only alternative i could see would be stronger eastern european collaboration , but it is hard to imagine when countries act myopically and whole situation resembles [ prisoner 's dilemma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prisoner%27s_dillemma ) . 
  i would like to hear your opinion on this topic . 
  do you think it is possible to provide viable , sustainable and culturally attractive project of economical and political collaboration for the borderlands ? 
   interwar l'viv dialect i have heard it from movies only , indeed it sounds familiar . 
   than modern bia\u0142ystok dialect agree with that , as [ wikipedia ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/gwara_bia\u0142ostocka ) says gwara bia\u0142ystocka also dropped verb endings , e.g. 
  by\u0142em , by\u0142e\u015b -  by\u0142 , by\u0142i\u015bmy , by\u0142i\u015bcie -  by\u0142i , but when i was in bia\u0142ystok , could not find anybody to use local dialect or drop the ending , everybody just spoke proper polish . 
  language question is a broad and difficult question . 
  legally , in constitution it is written , that official language is lithuanian . 
  regulation for bilingual signs , names in passport , names of registered companies , etc of course may not use ** only ** official language if there was a decent edition of * law of official language * explaining all this . 
  but in reality it has been pain in the ass , because there is a regulatory body , a government funded `` language commission '' , that has the staff with mentality and education of soviet era , setting rules , vocabulary and whatnot , that are purist , autocratic in their decisions , trying to `` preserve '' the language by meddling in everyday business and figuratively * strangling * it . 
  this all is probably a divide between more liberal and soviet mentality , also involving money , influence , politics , etc. . . 
  language commission is exclusively controlled by the hardliners . 
  especially absurdly looks their ways of action , when in a free country , condemning attempts of change and dissident opinions with soviet style shunning and officiose denunciations , signed not by name , but by `` a collective '' . 
  the problem is more hurting for ordinary language users than famous onion spelling question in france : lithuanians do not have full control of the name , that is written in their passports , because it must follow general rules of lithuanian language , if somebody decides that a name is lithuanian then it has to follow language commission rules ( scientifically absurd , and legally discriminatory ) , what goes for non-lithuanian sounding names ( very specific , huh ? ), 
  they are spared of this curse , except the letters in alphabet is finite , and there can be no x , w , \u0144 , \u017c , \u017a , \u0142 , \u00e4 ,, 
  i just wanted to put it to make it more like what it was like to be in wo\u0142y\u0144 in 1940 . 
  if we wanted any comparisons , it probably only compares to zombie apocalypse . 
  about justification , popular justification of all atrocities , committed by stalin is that it was needed to win the war , what is not logical reasoning , but you can find it so very often . 
  bargaining for lives with future , for some transcendental , ideological meaning . 
  it easily goes to who started fight , who retaliated , who was worse and so on . 
  and it works on many nations all around the world . 
  interesting part is , that before interwar period there was one nation . 
  there must be some reason in transition of identification from compatriots to enemies in two decades , right ? 
   invade others < ...  including taking wilno in 20s i would disagree with this one , because most of soldiers were from dywizja litewsko-bia\u0142oruska , that is they were mostly tutejszy ( substantial part of polish army , fighting bolsheviks were of eastern territories , fighting for their homes , also illustrative that [ odezwa do mieszkanc\u00f3w by\u0142ego ksi\u0119stwa litewskiego ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proclamation_to_the_inhabitants_of_the_former_grand-duchy_of_lithuania ) even got pi\u0142sudski accused of treason ) . 
   anarchism < ...  it was debated many times . 
  i guess you are right . 
  [ just wanted to recommend a book , that i like . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcxmv-4hfxs ) p.s. 
  i am in lt right now , and can say that information about polish minority in lithuania is not reliable ( i.e. 
  no of `` complaints are justifiable '' , and definitely nobody `` feel threatened '' ) . 
  if you wanted to know more , the leader of akcja wyborcza polak\u00f3w na litwie goes to moscow way more often than to warszawa and in all questions agrees with kremlin , uses putin rhetoric about crimea , or even local history , tries to block business development in polish speaking areas to keep it rural and poor ( despite it 's proximity to capital ) , and [ this picture with \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 ] ( http://bendraukime.lrytas.lt/isklausykite/atviras-laiskas-tautieciams-lenkams-man-geda.htm#.u6fpkxz-bov ) is the newest excess . 
  also , polish lithuanians are overrepresented in military and power structures , because of family traditions , and are generally more loyal to the state . 
  these `` complaints '' do not have any content at all , especially when the main complainers are in power . 
  and again we are repeating the same mistake . 
  poles have not changed , nor have ukrainians . 
  just using modern liberal-democratic reasoning when talking about epoch of nationalism , and even more , about wwii is just not a way to go . 
  it does not explain why it happened . 
  tell me why did they kill the innocent ? 
  because they were evil ? 
  is it enough to know that some people killed other group of people just because they were inherently evil ? 
  is that good an answer for you ? 
  not for me . 
  just think for a minute , why would somebody see random women and children as a threat to their security ? 
  there is no justification , or reasoning , no right or wrong , no human rights , or countries to put laws : forget all this , there is you and your life . 
  what do you do ? 
  what drives you ? 
  about justification , i refuse to justify any death , or put a meaning to it , because it puts into a trap . 
  there were just people trying to survive fighting anything they say as threat . 
  just answer me a question how come ukrainian polish citizens became on different side of barricades ? 
  what about jewish polish , belorussian polish ... ? 
  why would anybody see a person of some ethnicity as a threat to their lives ? 
  imagine being an oppressed minority for decades , and being killed , starved , where ( in modern terms ) your state did not provide for your human right for your life , and there comes some other people , who say : now nobody will kill you , take your food , starve you to death , or take you to war if you do not volunteer , you are in charge now , here is working administration , here are just courts ( not seen before ) and working healthcare system for all ( not available for them before ) , of course you will support `` your own '' people and regard them as heroes . 
  it is nothing unnatural about that , poles also do this . 
  just an adage `` he is a son of a bitch , but he is our son of a bitch '' says a lot . 
  i am sorry for the rant , it just hurts so deeply to see , that there is still so many artificial divisions and no trying to even understand what happened . 
  if you just look at history of wwii , you can see bunch of different histories : ukrainian , polish , belorussian , russian , jewish , communist histories , that are all so different , except the fact that they all talk about the same people and happened in the same place . 
  the only common thing that non of them tell any history at all . 
  i do not know if it will get through to you , but it is immensely sad to see the same mistakes of reasoning , that actually caused all the suffering to be repeated in a discussion here . 
  with respect , i hope i put it down the response clearly enough . 
  not to be a dick , but ukrainian insurgency was a product of discrimination of ukrainians in polish republic , and [ betrayal in riga ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_of_riga ) . 
  upa also assassinated moderate politicians to electrify the environment and diminish chances of peaceful reconciliation . 
  just wanted to say that there are no easy decisions or good guys in wwii . 
  arguably , the good guys died or were executed . 
  and one 's liberators usually were the other 's ethnic cleansers . 
  it is important not to forget , that most of atrocities was a product of more than one actor . 
  just to remind that polish nationalism in many ways has to bear a fare share of responsibility of what happened if anybody wants to avoid putting others into a totally unproductive for discussion defensive stance . 
  blaming russians for letting bolsheviks to power is the same as blaming germans for letting nazis to power . 
  also , probably russian nation suffered the most and the longest from that particular evil . 
  the most important is not to defend the evil and whitewash it , because who does not learn from errors will be the one repeating them . 
  when all the nations stop the blame game , reconcile the differences , and give proper homage to the victims , then and only then our societies can start healing . 
  it has been quarter of century . 
  i think it is about time to get to another stage of grief . 
  ukrainians got to anger stage , substantial part of russians are still in denial . 
  it is natural , but if we do not get to accept what happened then it is bound to happen again .
