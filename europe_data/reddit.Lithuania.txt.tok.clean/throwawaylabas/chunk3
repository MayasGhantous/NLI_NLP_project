  well , you have a fair point , that people write books about what interests the society . 
  of course , government funding on those matters is bigger in russia , but it does not change the fact that everywhere everybody try to influence public opinion for commercial or political gain . 
  just do not feed the fanatics , that use flawed argumentation , you are not going to change their minds . 
  there are some people that always see an opportunity to push their opinion , and probably your comment looked defensive , what triggered the reaction . 
  nonetheless , the post for me is relevant and interesting , because you can not make this up , and obviously those book titles is illustration of what russian public sees and is influenced by , which is important for anybody who wants to understand it . 
  in original link in origin section it is explained that liberum veto was the main cause of disorder in sejms , but also the impact of multiple different legal traditions and lack of parliamentary procedures should not underestimated . 
  also we have a some similarity with the eu that has certain decisions to be taken unanimously , and also is a largely divided entity . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliament_ ( expression ), 
  fast forward to [ fact check ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22unrx/russians_protest_in_estonia/cgr8066 ), 
  that is why only united europe can defend it self . 
  the borderlands suffers more in optimistic and also in pessimistic scenario , but it only shows , that if you leave them for themselves they do not have a chance . 
  works for ukraine as well as europe and united states also ( imagine us [ left alaska ] ( https://twitter.com/deibak/status/448783191361720320 ) to deal [ with ] ( https://scontent-b-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/t1.0-9/10154209_667646246629331_342164624_n.jpg ) [ threats ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21tv3b/dont_mess_with_poland_warsaws_military_may_be_the/cgh8hir ) ) . 
  sources for the [ first ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-soldiers-allowed-arms-following-first-death-175641630.html ) [ image ] ( http://bearingarms.com/why-are-russian-soldiers-in-crimea-armed-with-american-rifles ) source for the second [ image ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvvplej8s0&amp;t=50s ) more info : http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/22vxbn/ar15_rifleman_in_crimea_vs_ar15_rifleman_in/, 
  you are right that there is no proof that the pictures were taken where it is claimed it has been taken . 
  on the same sceptical note is there any information about mercenaries other than kremlin claims ? 
   only fuels russian anger actually russians mostly blame gorbachev and call him a traitor , even trying to put him in jail now . 
  strangely , i am even thankful that it cleared out something in domestic landscape . 
  now there is even more proof about who works for whom . 
  like wallonia in western europe, 
   secret tesla experiments he was killed for in this light , pigeon from tesla 's diary [ gets another spin ] ( http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla ), 
   wtf am i even reading sir , what you have read is ... b u l l s h i t. just here we have one teenager with sockpuppets trying to promote an uncritical image that he sees in the map . 
  but those guys like nikonov , zadornov et al. 
  brilliant , popular , well educated men , who know what they are doing are not just idiots , but real danger . 
  of course . 
  no problems about that . 
  i am not a geneticist either , that is why i do not have any far reaching claims here , only what is common knowledge . 
  the problem with this map , that it is not give all the context , and what it does give may be ambiguous for somebody . 
  so problem is not with validity of data , but with possible interpretation . 
  just to be clear what we are talking about : is [ this ] ( http://thegeneticatlas.com/r1a_y-dna.htm ) what you call slavs ? 
  it originated as far as we have info , 18 500 ybp , that means waaaaaaaaaaaay before there was any distinction between slavs ( ~ 1500ybp ) and other indoeuropeans ( ~ 4 . .7 kybp ) or anything we could clearly recognize as anything we know from our historical data . 
  also do not take the percentage as final , for example have you taken the test do you know your haplogroups ? 
  and you know that it is only one ancestor from thousands of generations ... 
  those guys are hilarious !, 
  strangely , sometimes i think parliaments exist for entertainment , not for any constructive purpose . 
  you can even measure the level of being slavic ... wow you must be genius , can you measure percentage of santa clause being american ? 
  u wot m8 ? 
  actually those labels are there just to simplify the picture ; to make the map readable . 
  [ paleogenetics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup_r-m420 ) is an interesting field , just for some dilettantes it induces dreams and illusions of omniscience . 
   it 's [ a third world country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_world ) in the middle of the eu switzerland ? 
   poorer and more corrupt then any of it 's neighbours probably not ... 
  i am confused now . 
   cultural dump now that is a real russian speaking !, 
  yes , he said that moscovites are hostile towards [ inner migrants ] ( http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.thenation.com/article/176956/how-russian-nationalism-fuels-race-riots&amp;sa=u&amp;ei=guq9u-xfo9ky7abp-ihycq&amp;ved=0cdeqfjae&amp;sig2=y24akgq97m0j_1vutfne0q&amp;usg=afqjcnetqhmj1j_rzfwwnxervs7vcolhrg ) who are usually more polite and does work happily and serve better than locals . 
  as a matter of fact , his grand journey spanning all summer , over all major cities and traveling to far east and baikal and caucus to camchatka . 
  he liked siberia the most for the people . 
  thank you for nice words , i used this [ map ] ( http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/pics/geo200/language/spanish.gif ) . 
  if we would try to illustrate invasion of crimea , that would look like mexico invading texas , california and florida . 
  compared to that latvia is like arizona , so not yet possible to invade . 
  and the similarity of us to latvia is that those latino americans as russians in latvia do not even think about supporting foreign invasion ( unlike crimean russians ) . 
  and as a matter of fact in lithuanian military ethnic russians are overrepresented , so if there was an invasion , they would be the first ones to fight , which is also relieving , and shows that all those discussions are by far only a political thing , and hopefully it will stay this way . 
  thank you again , enjoyed talking to you . 
  though , question was not addressed to me , but i have some anecdotic evidence : meet my friend x , ethnic russian , son of 1980 's migrants , gay , when came to see moscow , he learns that he has never felt so alien anywhere ( he has been traveling in north and south americas , europe , even south asia , so he sure knows what is cultural shock ) : the * real * russians are mocking his pronunciation , even grammar , calling him a fascist from a fascist country . 
  i am sure he did not mention his homosexuality there . 
  but still he comes back home . 
  and now he is different . 
  he feels never at home . 
  before his grand trip to russia , he would be proud of his grand russian fatherland , now he says he is like panda : he is not black , not white , not asian . 
  i am sure he would be happier to be sure to come to russia as lithuanian , who just happened to be fluent in russian , than the other way around . 
  the policies are extremely lax in eastern europe , and paradoxically , that breeds the discontent , because the free russians ( from free countries ) can never come back to russian federation , because that is a scary place , and they know it , just the new country is not making them take on new identity , and that possibility of choice leaves them confused , between the two worlds wondering where to go ... and who to be . 
  while in the same time the `` new country '' does not want to repeat what happened in 1941 , or last month in crimea , so distrust is mutual - a good fuel for destabilization . 
  even seemingly simple problem becomes major , having extremely tragic context that is omnipresent in every move . 
  thank you for your reply . 
  it is sure a land of paradoxes , and in us there may be only a few comparable phenomenons worth of mentioning : maybe ... [ money power ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_the_republic_we_must_reclaim ) ? 
   are you certain about that ? 
  from an outsiders perspective , we are getting some serious mixed messages russia is in ruins , maybe only moscow and saint-peters-burg is not , but i took that part from u/stressinsh :  discourse in russian :  fuck ... we are latvian citizens , we do not plan ( have nowhere ) to migrate to russia ( btw who would want to ? ), 
  when we talk about language problem , then most discussion is like that : - will it be bilingual type ( like belgium ) ? 
  - or with highly influential minority ( like finland ) ? 
  - or monolithic country ( like usa ) ? 
  of course the last type is not popular amongst anybody and is called radical-extremist , while the finland model is called discriminatory . 
  but reality is like , imagine you are a latino american , you have never heard english in streets , you finish school , get driver license , everything , even university without bothering to learn a word in english , maybe occasionally on radio or tv , or from your neighbors you could feel the presence of the language , but every time english speaking person finds out that you are a latino , they would switch to spanish instantly not to `` bother '' you and not make you uncomfortable . 
  how would you feel when somebody did not speak spanish and asked you to speak english ? 
  you would say , why do i have to ? 
  spanish is far more common !, 
  i never had to !, 
  you go learn ** my ** language !, 
  those are guttural , natural responses . 
  totally understandable . 
  but unfortunately , that is where we went in quarter of century ... also ethnic russians are far more prosperous in latvia than they would ever be in russia , and the stream of russian citizens immigrating and asking for permit of residence is on the rise . 
  i do not know i cleared anything out or made it even more confusing ... sorry about that . 
   that denied the occupation is that even legal ? 
  do they deny holocaust as well as in soviet times `` fascists killed soviet citizens '' ( without mentioning that it was jews in gas chambers ) . 
  being from lithuania , i have to say , that only russian perspective was not exaggerated or ridiculed . 
  but you are right it is a `` festering sore '' , and it not an ethnic problem only : it has a lot to do with who has power , wealth and how to gain it , when it easy to sell themselves to foreign power to influence your compatriots , be rich in expense of your others , and work to ** destabilize the country ** et al. 
  the same has been done before ww2 , later transnistria , chechnya , georgia , ukraine recently : recipe works and we are bound to hear the same song over and over again ... 
  there is a old good recommended video about the techniques used : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qkf3bajd4 but there is one more thing : russians are happier to be russians in latvia than russians in russia . 
  that speaks volumes for me . 
  talk while you [ can ] ( http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/03/25/after-may-9-it-will-be-punishable-by-5-years-in-russian-prison-to-talk-about-ukrainian-crimea/ ),

  - how ? 
  - ice-crimea, 
  i fully understand your position , just it is not nearly as independent as you think . 
  and russia is not trying to have good relations with any of the neighbors , even belarus has problem , not talking about japan , china , central asia , caucus , ukraine , baltics , that are constantly on-toes economicly , militarily , media-wise , not even talking about sabotage of inner politics ( same as . ua ) . 
  it is not cooperation and never was any cooperation , because even in ussr times relations were exclusively exploitative and exhaustive . 
  let us not pretend that cooperation and neighborhood is in goals of this government . 
  please do , it is an interesting topic , is there any new developments in that field ? 
  this year is 500 years after [ battle of orsha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_orsha ) . 
  with a cliff hanger in the end . 
  i would love to see the questions !,
