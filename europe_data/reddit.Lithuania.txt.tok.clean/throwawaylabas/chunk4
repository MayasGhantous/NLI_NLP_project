  are you somewhere feeling lonely ? 
  guys you are killing me !, 
  indeed . 
  this is like doubling human population of earth orbit . 
  i do not know a lot about space , so appreciate the info . 
  also , would be interesting to see how to launch a peruvian satellite to space by hand  edit : launch a ~ ~ peruvian ~ ~, 
  sorry for off-topic intro , just in the context of current events in europe i would like to say that bullying a redditor because of a flair next to one 's name is really disgusting and not acceptable . 
  even more : one can find a post in self-righteous tone with a flag : fr next to it ( we all heard absurd excuse of `` peaceful '' guns and vessels paris sells to whoever has money ) keeping in mind that in this situation population of russia is a lot less capable to protest . 
  so all those numerous witty threads that jump on any person with a flag : ru is a bigoted and i will downvote them together with all responses to them ( defensive or sarcastic or accusatory ) and invite fellow redditors to do the same . 
  on the other hand we all know soviet type of distraction technique journalism , when major bad news is shown as no big deal ancient history and quickly there are some good news , everything is balanced out and the show goes on as usual . 
  also , playing down gravity of things with jokes , injection of doubt and uncertainty and derailing any thoughtful discussion with absurd comparisons are also known techniques to be aware of and not to tolerate . 
  op , if you could clear it out just a little bit for me , to get the keynote of this article . 
  why do we need to know exact days ( tuesday-wednesday ) in the title ? 
  is it important ? 
  does it convey key information or could be omitted ? 
  keeping in mind , that said `` early morning '' of tomorrow will be evening of today in most of europe [ utc 2117 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soyuz_tma-12m ) and that [ expedition ] ( http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition39/index.html ) was planned for years and is on time . 
  just to understand the train of thoughts in time of posting it and how it is news-worthy to you personally . 
  so if there was a little more context i am sure there would be no place for misunderstandings , speculation and stupid comments [ `` about the war '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfl6lu3xqw0 ) . 
  thank you in advance . 
  kind of like :  remember us ? 
   be afraid . 
  be very afraid . 
  we snatch the locals and traffic them to rule us, 
  good observation , indeed , lithuanian language has nominative endings , like [ latin ] ( http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/haroldus ) , greek , et al. 
  english language has way [ fewer endings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suffix ) left ( to denote plurality , tenses , genitive case ) , but it does not mean the name has changed . 
  yes , he is a hero . 
  timothy snyder with the bloodlands , origin of nations , his talks about wwi , wwii , ukraine are just brilliant . 
  men like timothy snyder and edward lucas are doing a great job in making eastern europe relevant and understood for the world and ourselves . 
  cleaning the wound of soviet legacy of brutality and oblivion . 
  `` memory is not self evident '', 
  it may be my gay-ropean-jew-fascist-ness but i am proud of lithuanian-man . 
  he can compete in handsomeness with the macedonian and by coolness with finish . 
  those are some fine men here . 
  / s also , portuguese man o ' war, 
  central europe is the main way to * get * into europe . 
  throughout centuries all population movements into europe occurred through the same routes ( linear pottery culture , huns , magyars , alans , bulgars , mongols , turks , gypsies , you name it ) . 
  he just exploiting patronising sentiment towards europoor . 
  of course , this was just an excerpt from his interview , and he meant that the generation that is the political elite right now grew up under iron curtain with different worldview . 
  anyways , if you want a stable political system you have to have external borders , institutions that have monopoly of violence and population , europe can either choose faith of [ western roman empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fall_of_the_western_roman_empire ) ( with military , political , economical , ecological , demographic crises that resembles todays europe ) or go on and have `` house divided can not stand '' moment . 
  not bad !, 
  '' ... it 's became apparent eastern europe is so bad even war torn refugees think it sucks '', 
  yea , russians have an enviable option to choose : be european or asian , uk would love to be in a position where they can not be european  you may be right about counting on eu/us , but that position of moral compromises and cynical realpolitik , aggressive coercion is something to be despised in a good company , that is why the west look down on russian point of view , because it looks stubbornly evil and corrupt . 
  as [ u/eisenkatze ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jcu7t/what_do_europeans_think_of_georgians/cuoh02b ) and u/zetzet already touched on the subject that people make history . 
  it was mikheil saakashvili connection with valdas adamkus who tried everything with all his personal influence and connections to support georgia during the war . 
  sadly , less desirable impact in western europe and us , but it did bolster tourism , business connections , now lithuanians see georgia as a great place to spend their vacations or start a business in , and georgians have positive image of lithuanian politicians and diplomats who did their best when it was needed , and even obnoxious tourists from lithuania or changes in political direction of georgia could not change the image . 
  the same was in 1991 , when journalists , politicians from nordic countries ( j\u00f3n baldvin hannibalsson of iceland , swedish journalists , danish politicians , finish businesses ... ) did everything they could to help us get out of ussr , get recognised , accepted to international organisations of the west . 
  the only difference between baltic countries and caucasus is that we have great neighbours on the other side of the sea and your neighbours are not as stable , inspiring , helpful or just ok with each other . 
  though , lithuania needs some more [ khinkali places ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khinkali ) like in ukraine . 
  i like you . 
  that was awesome post, 
  sounds logical . 
  that is the only strategy that works . 
  happy that they succeeded . 
  they could not believe that even nazis could do that . 
  the enormity of event worked against him . 
  nobody fro high officials believed it could be true . 
  no , you got it wrong . 
  the most spanish thing is to hate spain . 
  catalans hate spain the most . 
  therefore they are seen even more spanish by the rest of spain . 
  well from what we know in moldova there were around 3000 soviet partizans only 7 of them were ethnic moldovan . 
  well , of course the creation of song , commissioning , decomissioning , release is a long story with changing political moods , but the girl is another fantasy made as many others during soviet times . 
  you know sometimes myths work better than reality , especially if one has zero real knowledge ( as in su ) . 
  add nice love story to a beautiful moldovan girl , plus catchy tune of ukrainian folk song . 
  voil\u00e0 , soviet heritage , now that is standard russian repertoire . 
  nobody believed in the stupid system neither the elites of nomenclatura . 
  the country was for grabs anyway . 
  imho , 1991 soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt the most important in all of the story . 
  i think estonians would like to keep further from russian border  anyways that would be cool, 
  but you know we are in north . 
  winter is coming . 
  no time for strikes, 
  first : not russian , but red army second : last soldier ( became rf ) to leave lithuania ( iirc the earliest country , earlier than germany e.g. ), 
  in 1993 , the last rf soldier ( they had a base in latvia ) to leave baltics 1999 . 
   increasingly unhappy with lukashenko it is usually told , that he openly hates the guy since forever . 
  well written . 
  especially the part with :  call an army general of their choosing, 
  the first thing on my mind . 
  the haggling game is even bigger than what we see , but what you wrote sums main stuff well enough . 
  oh right , i stand corrected, 
  add books in there too, 
  but admit that one has to be a class a-hole to try to drive after getting a parking ticket . 
  c'mon if you can not stop properly , how can you be so sure that you can drive ? 
  not even talking about disrespect to the officer . 
  well , the very fact that you do not see it as a problem says all . 
  well eu is not consistent in it 's policies that makes it prone to crises . 
  criminals can freely travel in schengen zone , but police , security , anticorruption , taxing institutions have their limits of jurisdiction , and do not cooperate enough to work against international organised crime , international corporations evading taxes , external threats that freely exploit it . 
  secondly , eurozone has special problem of fiscal policy discord , that needs solving . 
  maybe a hint of solution can be higher ratio of [ pro-eu citizens inside eurozone vs outside of eurozone ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/europe-union-brexit-eurobarometer/ ) , where people actually want more europe . 
  thirdly , conflicting digital standarts and no digital common market is another problem , that only exaggerates over time and leaves us hopelessly sluggish [ in the nightmare of asterisks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o37yjbfrrfg ) european union is .
