  in some respects eu has to join the points , because status quo is not always good . 
  if eu could have [ finnish exercise books ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/pupils_in_italy_excel_after_using_finnish_maths_book/7527106 ) , [ estonian e-governement and digital standards ] ( https://e-estonia.com ) , combine the best working solutions , that are easy to implement , then europe will not dwindle into oblivion . 
  also there are big guys out there having relative strength , against whom any eu nation is weak , and only together standing eu would have a chance . 
  wow , this is my favourite . 
  you can clearly hear that dialect has more soft sounds , * s * and of course latgalian vocabulary . 
  definitely amazing . 
  though melodically sounds a little like '90s russian pop music ( not exactly a compliment in this context ) . 
   i have heard them . 
  are they popular in latvia ? 
  wow , that was interesting . 
   except for the title and a quote from `` i fink u freeky '' , the song is in polish i like how he changed his appearance , but his hairstyle is still so polish . 
  wikipedia writes that he stays in uk - confirmed 100 % polishness . 
  gosh those two first are like twelve years old ... shiiiiit though other were more interesting . 
  \u0416\u0430\u043a was really interesting , though lyrics have a lot of very neat fragments , somehow feels interestingly less intense . 
  like a quick improvisation with a lot of very neat stuff . 
  and less sincere , somehow i do not imagine the singer to be a thief , even bad-words somehow do not roll from his mouth naturally - as if intellect and geekiness somehow would shine through . 
  is he popular ? 
  i can see that problem being under solution [ in here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32oerc/europeans_if_your_country_could_unite_with_one/cqd7msg ), 
  they did not do that for moral reasons , but because wanted to have a chance to buy something good for the money an power they had amassed . 
  they is soviet nomenclatura , kgb , party elite . 
  it is all for better life not for global peace . 
  technological and economical dominance of the us was absolutely clear to everyone . 
  it sounds logical , but the events happened almost a year after declaration of independence , there were other `` action '' before that ( e.g. 
  economic blockade ) , secondly , independence was not unexpected : congress of communist party deputies condemned ribentropp-molotov pact therefore admitting all consequences illegal . 
  it was no news . 
  just the countries that did not belong there jumped out of sinking ship first . 
  well , vilnius was poland when the war started ... 
  it is hard to tell where is what country as the borders were redrawn , whole countries ceased to exist ( such as lithuania or poland ) . 
  there were just territories , but there are some patterns that helps to explain what happened and more importantly show the power of ideological propaganda . 
  as a rule you could find collaborators in everywhere where soviets had just ruled before . 
  also percentage of killed jews was greater by order of magnitude if the state ( of which citizens the jews were ) is destroyed . 
  yes , you are right holocaust is riddled with stereotypes that come from the fact that the place where it happened got under iron curtain . 
  communist regimes were exploiting it for their ideological purposes obscuring it . 
  on the other hand the western world did not know a lot about it , so we have nuremberg trial defence strategy ( `` it is not my fault - superior commanded me '' , pointing fingers up until the dead end ) or myth that it was planned all along have become widely accepted as a fact . 
  i recommend you to look at this book to have a clearer look https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcxmv-4hfxs, 
  the official version is that soviet union was attacked by finland . 
  actually soviet nkvd shelled their own border post killing their own troops to serve as casus belli . 
  in an interview of ideologue of russian world told that russia and birch tree are closely connected : where the birch tree grows there is russia , there a russian person feels well ( at home ) . 
  i would vote for the [ swedish vase of shit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/20bxi2/poland_and_sweden_in_the_17th_century/cg1qhso ) . 
  [ no true scotsman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) , huh ? 
   lithuania , which , at that time , controlled lands down to the black sea this is misleading . 
  same as * russia * , the word * lithuania * has a lot of meanings - a confederacy , a military unit , a caste of loyals service to grand duke ( not to local dukes ) , a certain geographic and cultural area . 
  now it mostly means a country within lithuania propria , with mostly baltic lithuanian speaking population . 
  but in different times it had different meaning . 
  lithuania as a geographic term means the lands you mention . 
  grand duchy of lithuania is a multiethnic polity , where not control , but cooperation was key of it 's existence . 
  you can say rus waged half a millennium long civil war , where grand duchy of lithuania on one side meant tolerance , prosperity , european civilisation , multi centric society , and moscow on other side meant autocracy , oprichnina and isolation . 
  saying control implies lithuania conquered those lands , when in fact the very meaning of word lithuania means military confederacy , where the russian cities mostly joined the stronger polity and warred for it 's cause . 
  russian culture , religion not only survived , but developed and prospered in the grand duchy of lithuania . 
  so no . 
  it is not a control . 
  lithuania at that time means russia in the best obvious sense . 
   the kind of people that fight on the russian side in ukraine would n't stop because of worsening economic situation at home , nor is their steady supply of weapons going to dwindle coincidence that after getting `` humanitarian aid '' the attacks resumes , and fizzles out with time until next `` humanitarian aid '' is just a coincidence . 
  i think we ( europe i mean ) have lost the propaganda war when i read such upside down comments . 
  some historical background - lithuania ( without an army , totally dependent on russia in many economic and strategic respects ) negotiated to send red army home before germany did . 
  talking about results of negotiation . 
  talking about realpolitik - nobody respects sell-outs that are so easy to bend over for a penny . 
  this is our mistake . 
  stopping to defend realpolitik is about time as russia has relative strength against any of european nations , but is weak ( especially given it 's size ) in global arena or compared to eu as whole . 
  divide et impera . 
  that is what your view helps - to divide . 
  you said you [ clarification needed ] have no less historical experience dealing with russia than poland . 
  u/herr _ wildow had some concerns about truthfullness and historicity of this sentence . 
  to which you answered that lithuania is not poland . 
  are n't you yourself confused sometimes in your opinion ? 
  yeah , funnily , to russians france and germany have in common hitler and napoleon - two huge failures of european powers on russian turf . 
  - both victorious homeland wars . 
  most of the history with buffer countries ( from finland to israel ) is a respectful hate . 
  they may be week , but are no pussies , a russian in me speaks , different talk about the further-abroad ... 
  exactly my reaction . 
  attack ship to eu ? 
  hate this day . 
  aaah . 
  thank you . 
  a misspelling . 
  sorry , did not get it . 
  well , actually it is an indo-european root , in english a cognate would be * a bulb * , actually the edible part of potato plant is a * bulbous root * , not the poisonous fruit that looks like a little green tomato . 
  \u0431\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0431\u0430 / bul ` ba -  bul ` b\u0117 -  bulv\u0117 is quite a recent development there can be little questions about it that is why you can easily say it is slavic or latin borrowing . 
  we have all the stages of phonetic change ( as seen in other variants : bulva , bulb\u0117 , bulba , bulv\u0117 , bulvis , bulbas , gulba , bulvs ) . 
  feminine ending is more popular ( lat . 
  bulbus -  bulbas , slav . 
  the root cognate of * bulb * in baltic languages is * bumb - * ( \u0435.g . 
  kartupelis , karpelis , kartufelis , pentpelis , kartups , tupelis and other versions come from german kartoffel , a dissimilation from tartoffel , ultimately from italian tartufolo ( vulgar latin * territuberem ) meaning truffle . 
  \u017eemobuolis literally comes from \u017eem\u0117 ( terre ) + obuolys ( pom ) , such as erdapfel , or swedish jordp\u00e4ron , literally earth-pear . 
  patatas , batata , potato is a borrowing from carribian languages . 
  those words are as new as the plant , just couple of hundred years , so you can clearly see the etymology of words . 
  yes , i mean those kartupelis , karpelis , kartufelis , pentpelis , kartups , tupelis and other versions come from german kartoffel , a dissimilation from tartoffel , ultimately from italian tartufolo ( vulgar latin * territuberem ) meaning truffle . 
  bulba , bulv\u0117 , bulvis , gulba , bulvs come from slavic bul ` ba a word cognate of bulbous root , or a bulb .

   encompass both < ...  military triumphs such as starting a world war 2 together with germany , or invading finland and getting a million soldiers killed just not to stop the invasion in shame, 
  actually it is a borrowing from slavic . 
  that should be our name or at least a motto . 
  long live the rzeczpospolita of potato countries , or united potato of europe !, 
  in the manner of this map it would be : bulba , bulv\u0117 , bulvis , rapukas , pumputis , d\u016bl\u0117 , roputis , kartupelis , \u017eemobuolis ( = pomme de terre ) et al. 
  edit : ~ ~ pom ~ ~ pomme de terre , thanks [ u/zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzspaf ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzspaf ) . 
  yea , i get your point and agree with it .
