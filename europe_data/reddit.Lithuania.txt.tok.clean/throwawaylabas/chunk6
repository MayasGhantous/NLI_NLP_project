  just added a little off-topic to your post , sorry . 
  the people were the ones creating the system and keeping it moving ( saying `` it was not the people it was the system responsible '' was a successful ( and now proven wrong ) defensive position during nuremberg trial ) . 
  chose one : * it is not easy to find sacrifices justified , if it 's other people who have to make the sacrifices * it is easy to find sacrifices not justified , if it 's other people who have to make the sacrifices * it is easy to find sacrifices justified , if it 's not other people who have to make the sacrifices * it is easy to find sacrifices justified , if it 's other people who have not to make the sacrifices p.s. 
  or is there another variant ? 
   for jealousy or revenge just another point , plus the power of soulless quotas and stupidity of the system . 
  if you need 100 enemies of the people by monday , the plumber from second floor will be fine . 
  nobody would put their family in said plumbers place , therefore they do it ( having a valid justification - survival ) and the system goes on . 
  in lithuania there is even a hard to translate motivational adage `` nesisuksi negyvensi '' - * you have to ** earn ** your living * , or alternatively * you can only survive by doing crooked things * , there is also double entendre in here , but the root of the first word has the same meaning as a * cheat * or * fraud * as opposed to more natural grammatically and logically * business * . 
  i see this saying as encompassing the brutal soviet mentality in it 's whole . 
  there are many reasons why those dehumanising systems worked even despite being counter productive . 
  i find it interesting to look at the expression of [ good and evil in humans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osfev35twsg ) . 
  sorry for off-topic . 
  i agree with you . 
  an american soldier : - what do you think will there be any protests ? 
  an elderly guy : - what protests ? 
  my dad was waiting for you guys for 70 years . 
  he would be glad to live till this moment to see you . 
  of course i did meant lead lease vehicles because there were ** no other cars ** in soviet union . 
  also red army is made up from the ones marching in front and those with guns in the back that shoots on the ones in front if they do not march forward . 
  the only thing i think you were trying to say * saw combat use * and those things are not mutually exclusive mind you . 
  of course they saw combat use . 
  they were having combat use for a decade after the war ended if you would care about that much detail . 
  why did you post this ? 
  it is general knowledge . 
  [ stalins organs ] ( http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/weapons/palestine/katyusha.jpg ) were built on [ studebackers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/studebaker#/media/file:studebaker_m16_52a_truck_1948.jpg ) . 
  what i wanted to say , that the good stuff went to nkvd , the front line soldiers had little of this . 
  also , those frontline soldiers were usually drafted from occupied countries , not from sowjet union , as a matter of fact . 
  i was arguing the part about `` sowjet war effort '' . 
  without doubt eastern front was something of utmost brutality , just most of it can hardly be called soviet war effort , as soviet historiography was trying ( e.g. 
  jews being killed not because they are jews , but because they are `` soviet citizens '' , though most of the places they were born became soviet union or a socialist state only * after * the war ) . 
  i was trying to argue your position that resembled to me a lot like soviet propaganda , but what you wrote in your reply i imagined is absolutely known to everybody without even mentioning as a prerequisite of understanding even my previous comment . 
  i am not going to go further in that direction , but i have one question : why the fuck success makes somebody less a villain ? 
  some things are amazingly successful that does not make them good . 
  in my view success is irrelevant and in this business ( exterminating peoples ) even undesirable . 
  he did not say end up , but would definitely look like that on the map , with the russians being serbs of it . 
  same as estonians would be overshadowed by ethnic russians in [ baltic federation ] ( http://www.mapijoziai.lt/infografikai-su-zemelapiais/baltijos-salys-o-kodel-ne-vieninga-baltijos-valstybe/ ) . 
  and the history is way different , as religion , work ethics , etc. . . just look at the stance on ukraine , where every country has rather more pragmatic stance , but lithuania , poland and belarus so fiercely defend ukraine , despite having separate directions about pretty much anything . 
  people underestimate the brutality and horrors of eastern front . 
  for example american goods from cars to shiny shoes were reserved to nkvd , not the red army . 
  you know that it means . 
  did i get the reference to [ this ] ( http://cached.newslookup.com/cached.php?ref_id=203&amp;siteid=2170&amp;id=5199968&amp;t=1394710620 ) ? 
  i know , right ? 
  that is how humans works . 
  the interesting thing is that everybody does the same mistake . 
  when you think you get it about other country , remember this moment . 
  http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/65213-briefly-stated-the-gell-mann-amnesia-effect-is-as-follows-you edit : revenge best served cold . 
  last year u/mrstrange15 once wrote something about butthurt eastern europeans in a context that showed general disregard and ignorance of situation in dispute . 
  first i quoted his message ( as i recall it ) , but after 20min edited it be more relevant , so it is not downvoted below threshold . 
  sk\u00f8ll with a can of faxe royal ( my favourite beer ) . 
  actually your comment does make sense as you tell what you meant , not what people can imagine , but we do know that the same armchair experts sometime are we ourselves . 
  that is why stalin got relatively scot-free . 
   international conflicts in baltics/eastern europe are solved by drinking vodka . 
  damn it !, 
  minsk accords got it all wrong !, 
  they would better have a drink together . 
  hey , i * love * how russians are portrayed in hollywood . 
  most of the time they are all good looking badasses . 
  also ko\u015bciuszko 's will left his american estate to be sold to buy the freedom and education of black slaves for independent life and work . 
  none of the money that ko\u015bciuszko had earmarked for the manumission and education of african americans in the united states was ever used for that purpose . 
  filthy ` muricans, 
  which of western european countries do you have in mind exactly : is it in malta , italy , greece ... ? 
  fyi : 53 \u00b0 53 \u2032 48 \u2033 n is southernmost point of lt 53 \u00b0 33 \u2032 18 \u2033 n is northernmost point of nl the more to north you go , the nearer east and west gets . 
  iirc , lithuanian armed forces has the highest percentage of women professional soldiers in nato . 
  well , it 's too late to explain to the guy who made the map . 
  is n't it ? 
  gosh he could be a president of whole eastern europe and make it cool again . 
  https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041f\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0438_ ( \u0441\u0445\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0456 ), 
   rehabilitation programs for people who were affected by the conflict this is absolutely important the most needed help for ukraine right now . 
  difficult to understand for a person sitting on a couch , redditing even understand how war fucks up the minds . 
  the difficult part is that in ukraine it is a hard sell , because of all the soviet views in society , where mental illness is stigmatised , and saying that you are shrink is shameful , and ptsd is soldier 's problem not society 's . 
  lithuania has the same problem , though it is less obvious and manifests in alcohol consumption . 
  well , anecdotal evidence is not the best choice in this case : we have belarusian shelves in our store , because our finance guy decided to go cheap , then wasted half a day trying to put it up . 
   lithuania imports from belarus as much as from e.g. 
  belgium , around 1.5 b$ , exporting a bit more , and tourism from belarus grows around 10 % each year mostly coming for shopping . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/belarus/ products are usually heavy machinery , generators , agricultural products , such as soy for hipsters to make vegan steaks , etc. . . btw , today was a [ lt-by meeting ] ( http://mfa.gov.by/by/press/news_mfa/a12e2cee2a1d2e58.html ), 
  sometimes a flag means a lot . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_belarus if you do not trust cia , there is mfa http://mfa.gov.by/en/foreign_trade/, 
  international treaties are doomed if they are [ discussed openly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/two-level_game_theory ) with ukraine referendum there was no controversy or complicated , specialised issues : just a protest vote against common sense . 
  here , my friend , is actually a real world problem . 
  well from the footage you can clearly see that the plane is not armed with [ the system ] ( ` https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0425\u0438\u0431\u0438\u043d\u044b_` ( \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441_\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e\u044d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e_\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f ) ' ) . 
  do not forget the dollar crash and americans `` living off their fake money '' on the same note . 
   in the end i mean there is possibility that this is not a propoganda , but i am sure it is i totally agree . 
  in the west bad journalism hilarity ensues as a product of laziness , incompetence and sensationalism , in the east it is usually a product of brown-nosing the political establishment , because somehow an aliens-tv shows superpower intellectual abilities when it is about politics ... coincidence ? 
  we are sure it is not . 
  incredibly thoroughly researched guide !, 
  i have had a look at it before , but now i seriously consider purchasing it . . 
  despite being lithuanian , quite often i find myself lost in the multitude of information . 
  hopefully , your guide will help navigate, 
  it is a nice read . 
  fascinating how you can be a geek in almost anything , e.g. 
  a connoisseur of beer and appreciate it as an art critic appreciates art with in depth understanding . 
  you are trying to propose is we submit to americans our security . 
  this is wrong in so many levels . 
  why americans have to wage wars on our doorstep to keep us safe ? 
  pay for our security ? 
  russians are not attacking nato ideals on tv 24/7 for decades , you know ? 
  eu is what makes our continent peaceful this is what putin is afraid . 
  nato is for defence . 
  eu is to keep us out of war . 
  well , you are wrong .
