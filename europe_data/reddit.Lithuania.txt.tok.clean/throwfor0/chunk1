definitely cool / relaxed . 
  in a good way . 
  nobody knows why this stereotype exists , but it 's very popular . 
  are [ belgians ] ( http://www.allmusic.com/song/calm-as-a-belgian-mt0018116262 ) really so [ calm ] ( http://lithuanian.libsyn.com/lithuanian_out_loud_0026_beg_as_lietuvis_i_am_lithuanian ) ? 
  unlawful use of name and moral damage . 
  instead of jonas jonaitis we now use vardenis pavardenis ( ~ mr. name surnameson ) . 
   \u0161\u0137\u0113res looks like a part of the word me\u0161ker\u0117s i 'm almost certain that this is n't the way this funny letter should be pronounced . 
  [ i learned this a couple months ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/530x79/what_are_the_foreign_words_that_sound_misleading/d7p0rqq/ ) . 
  i 'm not even sure that standard english has this sound . 
  wiki tells me that it occurs in english when a scottish person says `` play '' . 
  in standard lithuanian these sounds are ( should be ) very different but nowadays everyone ( especially in the capital ) tends to shorten all the vowels ( most likely english influence ) . 
  and for some reason this annoys me  if a girl introduces herself as [ b\u028atk\u025bvit\u0361\u0283 \u028at\u025b ] i feel more like slaping her instead of asking her out for butchering her own surname , 
  jonas ( john ) and petras ( peter ) . 
  sometimes antanas ( anthony ) . 
  when making jokes about old babushkas then stas\u0117 and zos\u0117 are used often . 
  jonas was so `` stock '' that ~ 10 years ago it was used in all the specimens of various forms and documents , like '' * fill in your name , e.g. 
  jonas jonaitis * ( john johnson ) '' . 
  after numerous complaints ( and some lawsuits ) from people with this name and surname , it was banned from using as an example in documents . 
  also , when making jokes about other nations , we generally use these names : latvian - janis ; english - john ; german - hans , fritz ; russian - ivan , sasha , vasya ; polish - zbigniew , grzegorz . 
  i suck at this ipa thing , but i would say [ b\u028atk\u025bvit\u0361\u0283u\u02d0\u02c8te ] if you want to use standard language ( like on tv ) . 
  and if you 're wondering how to distinguish spoken latvian and lithuanian , just listen to this [ bit in latvian ] ( https://youtu.be/guoosp-lchc?t=25 ) . 
  latvians almost always stress the first part of every word ( while lithuanian is all over the place ) . 
  once you hear it in latvian , you ca n't unhear it . 
  the language has a very different flow . 
  grand duchy of lithuania ( 1561-1569 ) and later polish - lithuanian commonwealth ( 1569-1795 ) had a vassal state in modern day latvia called duchy of courland and semigallia . 
  this state had [ some small colonies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_courland_and_semigallia#colonization ) in africa ( gambia ) and the americas ( tobago ) . 
  so technically , very technically , you can call latvia , lithuania and poland colonial powers , 
  you can find out what the foreigners think about lithuania by googling `` stereotypes about lithuania '' . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.investlithuania.com/news/what-do-foreigners-know-and-think-about-lithuania/ ) one of the results . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2mnej0/you_know_youve_been_in_lithuania_too_long_when/ ) a humoristic approach ( somewhat true , but a bit dated ) . 
  you 'll find many more . 
  but , as one user already mentioned , you should really choose a university ( or even a field of study ) rather than a country . 
  quality of studies in our biggest universities is generally good ( but the quality of a specific field varies depending on which one has the best professors ) . 
  standard of living is probably the lowest among the countries you mentioned , but as a foreign student you 'll probably get a reasonable scholarship and will be happy with lower prices . 
  you can find some true in some of the stereotypes you 'll read but they 're generally about certain groups in our society . 
  as a student , you most likely wo n't have to deal with them ( if i , for example , would plan to study in the us , i would concern myself more with the system of education and less about attitude towards rednecks , gun laws and junk food ) . 
  that being said , the majority of foreign students i 've met , were happy about their life in lithuania . 
  which university did you apply to ? 
  basically any word that because of grammar and various word particles can be translated only as a whole phrase instead of a single word . 
  for example , take the longest lithuanian word `` nebeprisiki\u0161kiakop\u016bsteliaudavome '' . 
  it could be translated something like `` after a certain point ( in the past ) we just could n't gather enough [ wood sorrels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oxalis_acetosella ) anymore ( like we used to many times before that ) '', 
  ** lithuania ** i assume you meant $ 100,000 usd in a year ? 
  we are n't used to count our annual salary , rather our monthly salary , so i 'll explain it like that . 
  let 's say you sign an employment agreement where it is stated that your monthly salary is ( for simpler counting ) 1000 $ . 
  after a month you get your salary and your taxes are : ** income tax ** - 15 % ( the rate is fixed for everyone , but your taxable income is n't . 
  it depends , if you have kids , how many , if it 's your main job or not , etc. 
  it could be that the base of your 15 % income tax will be only 800 $ , or maybe 900 $ but whatever , it 's not important , i 'll calculate it like 15 % for all of your 1000 $ , because all discrepancies in your income tax can be fixed when you fill out your next tax return ) . 
  ** taxes paid to social insurance fund ** - 9 % . 
  these taxes consist of : * old-age pension security and social security tax * - 3 % ( you can choose to pay additional 1 % to your old-age pension security if you want . 
  i assume 3 % in my calculations here ) . 
  * health care tax * - 6 % . 
  so , in the end you get 1000 $ - 15 % - 9 % = 760 $ . 
  that is all for you . 
  your employer calculates and pays these taxes for you but that 's not all what your employer has to do . 
  your employer also pays taxes * on top * of your salary : ** taxes paid to social insurance fund ** - 30,98 % ( can be up to 1 % higher if you do the job of a higher risk to your health / life ) . 
  these taxes consist of : * social security * - 27,98 % * health care tax * - 3 % ** payments to the guarantee fund ** ( paid by all private sector employers , not applicable to the public sector ) - 0.2 % . 
  so , at the end of the month , we have three `` salaries '' : what you earned `` by contract '' - 1000 $ , 2 ) what you actually got after taxes - 760 $ , 3 ) what was your cost to your employer - 1311,80 $ . 
  i assumed here that you work a `` normal '' , regular job for somebody in a private company . 
  if you 're self-employed , the tax rates and calculations can be completely different ( too complicate to explain ) . 
  and finally , to actually answer your question , if you earn $ 100,000 usd in a year `` by contract '' , working for somebody else , you actually get $ 76,000 usd and the rest is your tax burden . 
  ok , vent / throwaway time . 
  1 ) i do n't have a strong opinion on 90 % of things or events . 
  and yes , that 's ok and normal . 
  you can never know all of the facts . 
  2 ) our mainstream media is extremely biased . 
  they favour the conservative party vs. every other party and usa agenda vs. eu agenda . 
  and that 's probably bad ( many people are brainwashed as a result ) . 
  3 ) i do n't discuss with other people my salary , religion or politics . 
  no , i do n't want to hear your opinion about it . 
  4 ) if you express your political views in public , 75 % of people around you will consider you dumb , regardless of your views . 
  so do n't do it . 
  if you have strong and fixed opinion about something , i 'll consider you to be dumb . 
  you can never be sure . 
  read less mainstream media , go read some descartes . 
  5 ) i fucking hate basketball . 
  6 ) there are no inherently good or bad political parties ( only the persons in them ) . 
  yes , even the labour party has some good ideas and good people ( albeit in the bottom of their list ) and even the conservatives or liberals have huge flaws in their politics ( that are often underreported by the media ) . 
  7 ) yes , we live in a zone of danger . 
  no , russia wo n't invade us tomorrow or next week ( and no , goddammit , i 'm no `` vatnik '' - russianlover ) . 
  8 ) i am a patriot and love my country despite numbers 6 and 7 in my list , so shut the fuck up about it , i 'm not a traitor . 
  9 ) and in connection to number 8 - being patriot or nationalist does n't mean being right-wing extremist ( or hating other people 's cultures / orientations / believes ) . 
  10 ) no , we are n't the most corrupt country or the biggest shithole in the world . 
  literally every country has the same problems . 
  so stop whining and read less mainstream media . 
  go read science news or something . 
  11 ) no , taking in 1105 refugees wo n't destroy our country or culture . 
  12 ) a lot of emigrants currently living in uk or ireland were just too lazy to try and work here at home . 
  13 ) bullying is not only children 's problem , it 's the problem of our whole society . 
  if you share a meme about a public person you hate - congratulations , you 're a bully ( how many clinton or trump memes have you shared on facebook today ? ) . 
  14 ) no , we 're not a `` beer country '' . 
  compare us to belgium or germany and you 'll see . 
  ... i could go on for ages ... 
  i saw the name of the director and immediately remembered my favourite polish comedy - [ kolysanka ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1623753 ) . 
  that might be my favourite polish movie ever ( and i 'm a person that does n't usually watch comedies ) . 
  i loved machulski 's sense of humor . 
  definitely will check out seksmisja , thank you for sharing . 
  i do n't usually watch comedies , but i loved [ i kina spiser de hunde ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180748 ) . 
  both [ parts ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246692 ) . 
  i rewatch them regularly - hilarious movies . 
  also can recommend [ pusher ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117407 ) trilogy and [ nordkraft ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403360 ) .
