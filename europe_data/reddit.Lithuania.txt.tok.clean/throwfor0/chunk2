  i have no doubt that there were lots of brave and interesting people that fled the commonwealth in the 18th century . 
  but none of the people from your list ( with the exception of domeiko ) had lithuanian blood . 
  so they may be regarded as heroes in poland but they are rarely ( if ever ) mentioned here in lithuania . 
  domeiko is certainly aknowledged here but scientists in history are often ( sadly ) overshadowed by military people . 
  as is the case with kosciuszko . 
  i would n't name kosciuszko the biggest national hero in lithuania by any means but i feel like he is certainly the one with the most interesting story . 
  but your list is also very interesting . 
  i 've heard about pulaski before but have n't had a chance to read about him . 
  and it 's the first time i hear about jozef bem at all , so thank you for that . 
  would love to get hold of some literature about them . 
  speaking about military commanders , i could write a long list of people who became famous for fighting germans , russians , poles , mongols , swedes , tatars , etc. 
  but i wo n't do that . 
  there are so many of them . 
  i would only like to mention one person that is not even our own national hero . 
  it 's a person we shared with our countrymen from poland and belarus in the time of polish - lithuanian commonwealth . 
  and it 's a person that could be of interest to you as an american . 
  he interests me as a personality . 
  it seems like he 's travelled half of the world joining every military conflict he could and excelled everywhere . 
  he became a national hero in poland , belarus , lithuania and usa . 
  he lived such an interesting life that i get excited just by reading his biography on wikipedia . 
  i would love to see a tv series about him , something similar to [ turn ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543328 ) maybe . 
  thank you for the response . 
  it 's actually an interesting , almost a phylosophical discussion worth of a separate thread - how people in different countries behave regarding cash and e-money . 
  at least in my country , the coins are worth something ( in a cheap place i can eat lunch for 2,50 - 3,00 euro ) , so they are necessary if you carry cash . 
  a lot of older people do n't trust banks and take out the cash from atm on the payday . 
  other people , on the contrary - they use only debit cards in order to better track their spending . 
  a lot of people want to have a little cash to feel safer ( to pay for parking / make small purchases in places where they do n't accept cards / for a day when your card is declined for unknown reasons ) . 
  i personally , need to see physical money in order to track my spending ( especially on a night out , but works everywhere actually ) - i make more calculated decisions on what i have to buy and what 's not actually necessary . 
  now , it 's actually a long time since i 've been in the us ( ~ 8 years ) . 
  but i still remember something that really baffled me - that an overdraft on a debit ( ! ), 
  card is possible without your permission . 
  like , if your ballance is 0,00 and you forget it , you are still able to make purchases . 
  and then your ballance becomes negative and you have to pay huge fees / fines for the bank . 
  and so many people had financial problems just because of this !, 
  would n't it be safer to use more cash for your daily transactions instead of always using a debit card like you do ? 
  or are n't you guys worried about that ? 
  or has something changed in your bank policy regarding this matter ? 
  are you an american ? 
  i 'm curious , because while visiting usa , i was repeatedly told by locals how uncool it is to have coins , ever . 
  and apparently , if you have coins in your wallet , it 's no longer a wallet - it 's a purse . 
  and guys do n't have purses . 
  only credit cards in their wallets ( maybe an occasional 20 $ ) . 
  they get rid of all the spare change throwing them into some kind of jar dedicated to some charity fund or whatever . 
  and a lot of 1 cent coins are just lying around everywhere . 
  i 've never encountered such attitude towards coins anywhere in europe ( yet ) . 
  edit . 
  and if the question was serious , [ this ] ( http://kartu.lt/getimg/620/620/0/24356.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.mylida.lt/get.php?i.691:w.640:h.599 ) is how i imagine a typical wallet ( notice the coin compartment ) . 
  foreign ones : italy x3 , france x2 , germany x1 , belgium x1 . 
  1 : 1 penny from uk ( apparently someone tricked me into taking it because of the similarity to a 5 cent coin ) . 
  2 : [ 2 euro commemorative coin ] ( http://www.lb.lt/n26160/aversas.jpg ) from my country that i never had the chance to lay my hands on yet . 
  so thank you for the question , i guess ( would n't have noticed it otherwise ) . 
  yes , exactly, 
  that poor woman !, 
  all her life she must 've thought that they 're all perverts  by mentioning wartime misunderstandings , you reminded me a joke that a russian guy once told me . 
  to fully understand the wordplay , it should be told entirely in russian , but i find it funny regardless . 
  setting : russia , wwii . 
  the frontline just moved to the next town . 
  everything begins to calm down . 
  in a field there is a badly damaged tank : all broken , smoking etc. 
  near the tank sits a middle-aged soldier and calmly smokes a cigarette . 
  a little boy runs up to the soldier and curiously asks ( in russian ) : `` hey , mister , did you take down this tank ? '', 
  soldier ( calmly ) : `` ja '' ( '' \u044f '' = `` me '' or `` i '' in russian ) boy : `` but mister , this is our , russian tank ! '', 
  soldier ( smiling , happily ) : `` ja , ja '' ( `` yes , yes '' in german ) . 
   suka oh my god , you just evoked a sense of nostalgia to my childhood . 
  when we were little children , everyone new the silly \u017das song based solely on this similarity . 
  we would constantly annoy our parents singing [ `` suka !!!, 
  gyvenimo ratu '' ] ( https://youtu.be/kllpen6uewq?t=59 ) ( `` turning !!, 
  ! , she 's turning !!!, 
  in the wheel of life '' ) . 
  so , is that something you could say to your grandma or on television ? 
  i 'll certainly try a glass of their `` fucking hell '' beer someday !, 
  speaking about names - `` schweinsteiger '' sounds funny to me . 
  i know that `` steigen '' does n't mean `` fuck '' . 
  but man , why else someone would `` climb onto a pig '' ? 
  oh man , [ it 's true ! ] ( https://thefreeonline.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/can-fart.jpg?w=271 ) . 
  i bet they get lots of tourists . 
  awesome !, 
  i cracked up at `` careful , slaves '' . 
  although i 've never heard a polish person say '' \u010dipka '' . 
  i 'm used to hear them say `` pizda '' instead which is universally understood in central and eastern europe . 
  with a lithuanian twist , this [ small pizza + d\u00f6ner place ] ( http://www.dykai.eu/archyvas/data/media/137/pizdon.jpg ) reads `` into the cunt '' . 
  `` chuj-ton '' = `` ton of dick '' ? 
  `` geil '' in german also can be `` horny '' , believe me . 
  many years ago i went to germany for my erasmus . 
  till that point i had been taking german lessons for 14 years ( started in 2nd grade ) . 
  so , i thought i knew the basic vocabulary . 
  but somehow all the time i would say `` geil '' about something ( as in `` cool '' ) , i was looked upon as a some kind of pervert . 
  in the end , i got confused and abandoned the usage of this word alltogether . 
  another german saying that always baffled me was `` das ist mir wurst '' . 
  like , `` this is sausage to me '' . 
  what the hell ? 
  my trail of thought always led me to this path : `` wurst '' = `` sausage '' , `` sausage '' may mean `` dick '' , `` this is dick to me '' may be the equivalent of russian '' \u043f\u043e\u0445\u0443\u0439 '' ( = `` under my dick '' ) , that everyone in eastern europe uses . 
  so maybe it means `` i do n't give a fuck '' ? 
  but is this offensive in german at all ? 
  i could n't fully grasp that . 
   any man who must say `` i am the king '' is no true king . 
  just kidding . 
  everyone has a centre of europe nowadays . 
  but still , you should visit our `` porns '' village .
