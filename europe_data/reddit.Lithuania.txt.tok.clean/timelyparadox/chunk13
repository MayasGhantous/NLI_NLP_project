  we have had 5 million years of cooling before humans showed up . 
  renewable has been cheaper than coal for quite some time now . 
  and they are reliable and has fairly low cost after being built . 
  but you are correct that it would be very hard to only do renewables ( not impossible ) so best course of action would be renewables + nuclear with some fossil fuel plants . 
  but subsidizing fossil fuels is counter intuitive if fossil fuels are cheaper . 
  but we are forgetting that it stopped being about cost . 
  we are not in the time of `` will be '' . 
  millions of people ** are ** dying , billions of infrastructure damage ** is ** happening and civil wars ** have ** started because of climate change . 
   just for the record i do n't give a sh.t about co2 well then you are a horrible human then . 
  no point in arguing with you . 
  they would obviously respond . 
  but probably not with nukes . 
  no sane person actually wants to use them . 
  well since we are not in totalitarian regime now we have far more than just hope . 
  there is plenty of businesses starting up here , heck we are one of the world leaders in laser technology . 
  plenty of people are returning from abroad to work here . 
  most of them educated . 
  our scientist was close to getting nobel prize and he is most likely going to get it next year . 
  life is far better here than it was 10 years ago . 
  well what is the cost ? 
  because i am only seeing benefits . 
  is the cost making putin sore ? 
  but the president has the code thing for the nukes does n't he ? 
  ireland has not voted to leave eu . . heck ireland is one of the key countries which shows how eu can benefit some countries . 
  situation in gb is not clear because the politicians are trying to play it slow , because rushing it would be bad for them , they need to look at what type of deals they can make with other trading blocks without eu support . 
  they also need to hire a lot of people because a lot of this was done by eu . 
  rewriting 40 years of trade deals is complicated so they need to know what options they have before deciding what kind of brexit they will have . 
  they would leave . 
  it would definitely take time because moving things like that is complicated , but they would leave . 
  just no one wants them to . 
  and both latvia and lithuania are increasing their % , it would be a stupid move to rise it instantly to 2 . 
  then again , trump would not know that because he has no idea how running a country works . 
  is n't audi under another scandal now ? 
  well they are taking multiple hits . 
  but they are one of the biggest car companies so i guess they were a bit prepared for shit like that . 
  seems like wv is handling this better than i expected . 
  yes , just when oil prices collapsed and russia started a lot of weird stuff . 
  ouch , stalin out of all the people is looked favorably . 
  pretty crazy . 
  pretty cool that even without our nuclear plant we managed to not fuck up on this . 
  i wonder how different would it look if we did build a new one . 
  you would not get people talking like that anywhere . 
  russia would surely want to connect its boarders . 
  yea but used car markets are huge . 
  `` save me from myself '', 
  maybe it was misspoken , the cancer was the one who was in terminal condition . 
  yes, 
  have you seen those killer abs ? 
  got ta catch them all !, 
  because lithuania is pretty as it is . 
  nah , all the salt mines are in poland , explains pis . 
  * looks at the username *, 
  if you live in latvia then you are expected to learn the language , that is obvious regardless of where you live . 
  but that is just natural . 
  not enforced . 
  wtf are you talking about , pretty sure there are schools which teach in russian . 
  sounds familiar . 
  til this is not popular elsewhere . 
  we are talking about real countries , not fictional . 
  that is a whole workday which is what i meant . 
  i do n't think they do it constantly all day . . 
  seems like a perfect source of material , you do n't need to cut the tree and bark grows back probably sucking more carbon out of atmosphere than normally . 
  you clearly did not count the famous 3 latvian tanks . 
  i never downvote , other people might disagree with you and express it in that way . 
  most of what you want is opposite of what pis wants . 
  if not these people there might not be lithuania . 
  the russification was done to such atrocious level . 
  i mean , you say that and did not mention the name ? 
  you know what they say , broken clock reports non-fake news twice a day . 
  probably it has something to do with russia stealing land from them and waging war in their territory . 
  all of which happened coincidently when ukraine was starting to move towards west quite quickly . 
  pretty progressive for state media to broadcast satirical videos on governmental issues . 
  pretty interesting coming from the guy who jailed those veterans . 
  you sound delusional . 
  just because you think you know better does not mean it is true . 
  no they are not , not even on the same level . . 
  yes green & peasant party is shitty at the job , but they are not undermining democracy . 
  that is what happens when you elect bunch of conspiracy theorists . 
  we have a few big companies having eastern europe centers . 
  heck in vilnius it is hard for bigger businesses to find office space so with the new office buildings recently being built it will hopefully accelerate it . 
  we should send them to africa , they could feed entire villages . 
  not my point , he is definitely dependent on other oligarchs . 
  `` independent '', 
  that is why you dissected his comment . 
  i thought there were tons of police in the city ? 
  how are they doing so little to protect peoples property . . 
  but if they stopped burning cars then the chances of it being on top of sub would be 0 ? 
  depends on why you are there . 
  i dont see any of your mentioned things as bad . 
  is there no california in us ? 
  nope , cuba has made a few advancements in cancer treatment and few other fields . 
  they have so called lung cancer vaccine which looks very promising . 
  well we have a strong healthcare systems all across europe , and cuba is known for having quite a few new and very effective treatment measures . 
  so we both have a lot to learn from each other . 
  i mean , that is a good way to get profitable deals . 
  since you clearly are an expert there is no point in carrying on this discussion . 
  who cares about 1million people ? 
  life is still way better than it was 20 years ago . 
  i know for a fact that people are returning , and most of doom screaming `` economists '' are politicians and not economists . 
  i work in the field where we deal with analytics on stuff like this constantly and i can see that nothing bad is going on .
