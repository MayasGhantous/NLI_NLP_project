  dunno , do n't remember . 
  do n't have one , do n't know anyone who does . 
  i 've only made deep fried food like 5 times in my life and when i did i just used a pot . 
  likewise , it 's the only benefit to be gained from an otherwise not ideal situation, 
  used to be jonas jonaitis , until one jonas jonaitis decided to sue . 
  now it 's literally name/surname, 
  i prefer the german name for us personally . 
  litauen sounds so much better to my ears than lithuania , it 's also closer to what we call ourselves lietuva, 
  honestly ? 
  yes . 
  but i 'm someone who enjoys learning languages , so that 's hardly surprising . 
  traveled to east asia twice . 
  that was the only time i left europe . 
  ** `` so you say , why would a democracy be any better ? 
  because , in order to meet the above problem , a majority would have to favor it . 
  '' ** no it would n't . 
  that 's not the scenario presented . 
  `` the majority must have a position that is against your own '' , is what we are talking about . 
  the difference between the two is as vast as the seas . 
  it would require transporting me to a fucking alternate universe . 
  i currently live in a democracy , where i do n't agree with a lot of it . 
  i would n't trade it for russia , but that 's not the question presented . 
  it 's not `` flawed democracy '' vs `` somewhat benevolent dictatorship '' , it 's functionaly `` you 're a lunatic in the post-apocalypse '' vs. `` you just became best bros with kim jong un '' it 's not a barbaric state because people want it to be barbaric . 
  it 's barbaric because i do n't . 
  yep , and there 's fuck all there . 
  you can not always disagree with a democracy unless you are clinically crazy . 
  you can always disagree with parts of a democracy , specific issues , not believe that a choice is the best one . 
  but you ca n't fucking disagree with everything . 
  deeply think about what you believe in , ** a lot , hell most of it ** is n't a question of party lines . 
  whether you 're a right winger or a left winger , progressive or socialist , there are a lot of things you agree with unless you 're literally to the far far far extreme . 
  a modern conservative and a communist probably both agree that a human life has some value , that 's not really a question that distinguishes both parties . 
  a country that would disagree with me on everything would be fucking mad max , not a country . 
  it 's not asking me whether i 'd live in putin 's russia and be bros with him vs living in say america , who has a lot of policy i do n't agree with . 
  it 's asking whether i 'd be putin 's bro or live in alien logic . 
  if it 's a democracy that always goes against my wishes , it is functionally indistinguishable from an oppressive dictatorship as far as i am concerned , or would more realistically lead to a mind-boggling mix of anarchy/police state as i am a centrist . 
  given the scenario presented , dictatorship no doubt . 
  `` a democracy '' i could not agree on a single point with is not a place i would like to live in . 
  as it so happens i believe in fairness , meritocracy , human rights ... etc. 
  a democracy i do n't agree with would basically end up being the islamic state or some other barbaric/feudal shithole . 
  part of yugoslavia . 
  cool name . 
  sorry , that is all . 
  some russians , some poles . 
  they do . 
  honestly , yes . 
  the needs of `` the greater good '' surpasses the needs of the individual as far as i am concerned . 
  as for my further beliefs on the matter . 
  `` a standard of living must be guaranteed to all citizens '' reflects my economic beliefs , however , that is all . 
  once those needs are met - it 's a free for all . 
  while i do believe in some reallocation of wealth , i do so to a limited extent . 
  a friend invited a syrian refugee when we celebrated his birthday , seemed like a nice chap . 
  he actually knew quite a bit of the language . 
  that is the entirety of my personal experience with middle easterners . 
  german on a permanent slow run . 
  actively - chinese . 
  hmm , i do n't think we have a `` true '' symbolic animal , but the closest ones would be the stork and the bear . 
  i do n't know of many lithuanian fairytales that have a happy ending . 
  they * might * have a happy ending for someone in particular , but in general , shit pretty much goes down as the basic premise . 
  43 $ if you have a month 57 $ if you can only wait 5 business days 71 $ if you need it tomorrow as for time , it lasts 10 years . 
  the knight on horseback . 
  we call it vytis . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_lithuania honestly , i love . 
  it 's a bit unique in the sea of eagles and lions . 
  i also like how simple it is . 
  just a red background with a white knight on a white horse on it . 
  anglija is the default for everything that is n't an official document . 
  in lithuania , there are three options for studying in universities dieninis/vakarinis/neakyvaizdinis ( day/evening/correspondence ) most people out of school go for the day studies . 
  people who work usually go with either evening studies or correspondence studies . 
  the difference is that in the evening studies you still have all of the classwork as do the daytime students , you just do them 6-9pm over a longer period of time , five years for a bachelor 's if i 'm not mistaken . 
  good shows do exist , but they are really heavily underfunded and there 's a large gap between the good ones . 
  it 's not going better , as basically most teenagers-young professionals do n't really watch tv anymore . 
  it already functions on a shoestring budget compared to when i was a kid . 
  honestly , the only thing i know of that people watch on the telly is sports and the news and basically nothing else . 
  as far as i see it vilnius , kaunas and klaip\u0117da are pretty much your only options if you do n't want `` a basic make a town/city work type of job '' like a clerk or a teacher . 
  if you want to do something creative and influential , you 're pretty much stuck to the big 3 , and i 'm not even sure if klaip\u0117da is even that really . 
  generally speaking , the 2md tier regions of lithuania are dying out . 
  places like \u0160iauliai are very much on their death beds as anything but a place you retire to . 
  the demographics are very much negative for all of them . 
  hell , the three cities combined make up a third of our entire population . 
  that 's just the cities , that 's without counting the surrounding areas from which people commute to them too . 
  honestly , most of lithuania . 
  * we * will talk shit about lithuania all the time , but that does n't mean that you get to do that . 
  i do n't believe said event happened yet . 
  2016/07 was n't exactly a long while ago . 
  gun laws are simply not a thing i 've ever thought about , at least where my country is concerned . 
  dunno , never once ate it . 
  n in lithuanian , c2 in english , b1 in german , a2 in mandarin , a1 in french and japanese , cursewords in russian and polish . 
  languages are a bit of a hobby of mine . 
  explain the image , i do n't quite get it . 
  honestly ? 
  i 'd say a lot of it . 
  most major cities/towns , spent time in most regions . 
  tis a tiny tiny country . 
  there 's a joke amongst a lot of my friends , that once we got into schengen , the streets became ** a lot ** safer at night . 
  but in general , it 's the criminals/pseudo-criminals who want to score something . 
  average people who are shit out of luck , they ca n't really survive here doing what they want to do or want some extra money for a project or two . 
  the later usually encompasses some manual labor in say norway for the summer to buy a car or something . 
  and then there 's the `` brain drain '' , which in most cases encompasses people who are dissatisfied , disillusioned with the country and the state it is in . 
  while there are other examples , i 'd probably say that these are the major groups . 
  as for the emigration as a whole , complicated issues .
