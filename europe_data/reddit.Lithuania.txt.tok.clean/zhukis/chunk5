  there points to be made about both sides . 
  please use lithuania and not you , while i understand what you meant to say , it nevertheless feels accusatory . 
  now then , my own beliefs on the matter : yes , poles have a right to be poles . 
  however , ** anyone ** living in the country for more than a few decades , without learning the local language is perceived negatively and as being disrespectful . 
  the russians left from the cccp era , the english businessmen , that goes for everyone , not just the poles exclusively . 
  if you 're no longer a guest , start learning , i do n't care if you 're not fluent but get to at least a conversational level . 
  most lithuanians do not consider that to be optional . 
  as for anything else you said , i honestly have no issues with it . 
  i have very few fucks to give if some sign has a crossed l on it alongside the lithuanian word . 
  i would n't like for that to be made the default system ( polish minorities are very regional and effectively non-existent in say northern lithuania ) , but if a community requests something to be added to specific signs , you 're free to do so . 
  most of the issues with that hail from the lithuanian language committee ( i 'm not sure how they name themselves in english ) , and as a lithuanian , i myself have enough of a beef with them as it is . 
  as a researcher , they are a somewhat persistent nuisance to me as well . 
  not really , no . 
  english has very soft consonants , while lithuanian has very hard ones . 
  speaking lithuanian with an english accent basically sounds like you 've bit your tongue . 
  hitting a rock once damages it a bit , but that 's about it . 
  hitting a rock repeatedly in succession , even with smaller blows , will shatter it . 
  an election by itself ca n't do that , however , an election in the midst of a lot of other shit can . 
  brexit/the refugee crisis/general problems with the mediterean economies combined have shaken the eu quite a bit . 
  if we get another few decades of `` nothing happening '' i 'd say that it would return to the point where the answer would be no . 
  hmm . 
  poland/russia/teutonic order throughout history , that 's about it really . 
  we 're pretty much neutral to poland , if not positive . 
  friendly from the point of a lot of shared history , some antipathy does , however , exist in specific regions due to some 20th-century nonsense and some polish communities who do n't know the adage `` when in rome , do as the romans do '' . 
  but beyond this , i 'd say our position towards them is rather a friendly one . 
  russia , trading partner . 
  that is about all the positives i can say about our relation . 
  our position towards them is pretty much `` the enemy we ca n't do shit about , but grind our teeth and wait for a brighter future and hope that they wo n't fuck with us '' . 
  not exactly friendly . 
  if i 'm being completely honest , russia is basically our boogeyman . 
  i suppose i should take the germans over the teutonic order , as it does n't exist anymore . 
  honestly , ca n't say anything bad about them . 
  the general perception of them is a very positive one . 
  to be fair , different cultures different outlooks . 
  the only reaction i can imagine from the stereotypical lithuanian to a gay pride parade is `` get these perverts off the streets '' . 
  the only thing i can see it doing is making them more isolated . 
  faina/as is used here as well, 
  i did n't do languages in my gymnasium classes . 
  i pretty much went full in into stem . 
  so i ca n't really comment on the final grades . 
  generally speaking , it 's lithuanian authors and european classics , such as don quixote / kafka 's metamorphosis etc. 
  i do n't really think i even remember something from american literature . 
  here are two lists , the first one is a schools required reading list for the gymnasium classes http://www.antakalniovm.vilnius.lm.lt/index.php/pagalba-mokiniui/literaturos-sarasai-5-12-kl the second one is the recommended reading list for grades 5 to 12 . http://www.mindaugo.vilnius.lm.lt/images/2015-2016/dokumentai/rekomenduojam%c3%85%c2%b2_perskaityti_knyg%c3%85%c2%b2_s%c3%84ra%c3%85_as_5-12_kl_.pdf i have no intentions of translating the titles , but you can get a sense from the authors list . 
  ech , i suppose so , i am 26 . 
  that 's a very friendly demographic where `` technophiles '' are concerned . 
  really ? 
  i see flagships a plenty . 
  well , not iphones , but still , the samsu\u016bng s phones are very common . 
  that period is generally referred to as the wild west in here as well . 
  basically , anything goes , no real government regulation to speak of . 
  words are n't static and meanings change from place to place , from era to era . 
  i doubt `` nazi/fascism '' means the same thing to a german and someone brought up in polynesia . 
  it claimed that what it was doing was communism to its citizens , that 's all we need to hate it . 
  to be fair , `` communism '' is viewed by young educated people here in mostly the same way you view `` rape '' , `` manslaughter '' . 
  it is not a term that has * any * positive connotations to us . 
  most societal problems are generally referred to as `` leftovers of communism '', 
  we do n't care . 
  `` communism '' is synonymous with the cccp to us . 
  when discussing communism , we discuss the cccp . 
  siblings - names/nicknames . 
  mom/dad - mom/dad grandmother/grandfather - grandma/grandad kid to older members - maam/uncle adult to adults - name that is if we use pronouns , pronouns , on the whole , can generally be omitted in lithuanian , only a verb is necessary to have a a valid sentence . 
  not rednecks per say but we do have localized gopniks . 
  \u0160iauliai , kaunas ir panev\u0117\u017eys is known as `` gez\u0173 trikampis '' basically the gopnik triangle . 
  other than that , the villages are n't exactly held to high regard . 
  tried some ended up with a lot of `` not available in your region '' and went `` fuck this '' spotify is nice , but i do n't really listen to enough music to have it run permanently . 
  so i had it for a bit over a year and decided that it 's just not worth it . 
  traditional names - yes . 
  all soviet depictions , in public areas , are banned . 
  i grew up in a relatively multicultural environment , so while i 'd like to give a sob story about learning a lesson , the only thing i can say is `` more of the same '' i guess the only real change is that i now think about nations that are more removed from me than i did before . 
  i certainly do n't lean left by ** our ** standards ; if anything , i 'm centre-right . 
  the problem is that what you call `` the right '' is what we refer to as `` the lunatics '' . 
  there 's a joke ( not the actual etymology ) about the lithuanian word for germany - vokietija , where a german is vokietis . 
  if speaking in a dialect , `` vo ans kiets '' or the shorter version `` vo kiets '' basically means `` that one hard '' or equivalently `` that 's a badass '' . 
  so jokingly , we named the germans after some badass . 
  i 'm not actually certain what the real etymology for the word is . 
  i visit them about 5-6 times a year . 
  i call basically every week . 
  that 's the honest answer . 
  while you probably would n't have many issues with the youth in richer/more educated areas , the public *** at large *** is not welcoming . 
  a piece of legislation outlying the rights of an employee vs the rights of the employer . 
  i 'd say lgbt rights . 
  paid education , work codex reform ? 
  i 'm not really sure . 
  grannies and grandpas are economically socialist and socially conservative . 
  the 40 somethings are a bit of a mix economically and are socially conservative . 
  young people are socially liberal , economically socialist if they 're from poor areas and economically liberal if they 're from rich areas . 
  these are my impressions . 
  in general as a 26 year old young specialist living in the capital , most of the people i interact with and my friends are classical liberals . 
  i imagine that position would change quickly if i was living in a dieing little town having nothing to do and no money . 
  to be fair , i do n't imagine sweden having a section of the population that are `` prisoner idolisers '' . 
  the americans have their wannabe gangsters and us post bloc countries have gopniks . 
  generally speaking anything that 's popular with that lot becomes inversely popular with the people that are n't like them . 
  hell , a track suit , if you are n't in a gym or in the middle of a jog is an ideological statement here . 
  and an ** excessive ** amount of tattos is basically associated with the aforementioned groups . 
  honestly my impression is of something like 1/3 fit , 1/3 chubby and 1/3 overweight . 
  basically all three types are common enough to where you do n't really notice them that much . 
  as for the `` i need a scooter to move '' fat , have n't seen one yet . 
  and lastly , as for fat shaming , we fat shame . 
  relatively openly , however most comments are basically in the `` i need to lose some weight '' style of self-deprecating humor by hte fat people themselves . 
  the people you have no connection to will rarely comment on it , unless they 're really drunk or you 've pissed them off .
