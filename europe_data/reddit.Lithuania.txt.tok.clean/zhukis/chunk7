  that 's kind of interesting on its own right . 
  what minority languages ? 
  100/100 , 9eur/mo , cheapest plan available to me without me having to sign a contract . 
  morally terrible , but when it works . 
  it works . 
  if you are wealthy , the american system will provide you with the best care in the world . 
  but ... if shit were to happen , quite frankly , you 're fucked . 
  i prefer a worse overall system to one like yours . 
  you have a lot of pies . 
  you decide to give out vouchers that are worth 1/5th of a pie and your neighbour does the same , he just chooses ti do so with 1/6th . 
  that 's a very simplified view of currency . 
  the pound is larger unit than the euro . 
  it 's like being angry at a centimetre that it 's shorter than an inch . 
  samsung first , cheaper androids like huaweis and then the iphone . 
  not as such . 
  notable individuals throught the centuries exist , but i ca n't think of anyone i 'd call the `` father of the nation '' there are many people who `` could '' fit the bill from our first and only king that united the lands https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mindaugas to the father of our `` modern '' language https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jonas_basanavi%c4%8dius and many an individual between the two . 
  i stopped caring years ago . 
  language is a tool of communication , if i can understand what someone is speaking and if they can understand me . 
  it 's good enough . 
  that said , i do n't mind someone pointing out my mistakes . 
  in general thought , i wo n't correct and ask for clarification unless i 'm asked to do it . 
  tourist with no lithuanian ? 
  no problem . 
  learn labas and a\u010di\u016b , congrats , you 're fine with that . 
  you 've lived here for 10 years ? 
  you either live in a bubble or do n't give a fuck . 
  either of which is n't viewed as respectable . 
  generally , you can go by , but there 's a time limit . 
  if you 're no longer a guest , start learning . 
  we do , the lithuanian version of that is jankiai, 
  is there a place in europe left where you would start learning the language `` old enough to remember '' ? 
  i think . 
  my entire interest in it waned the moment i turned 18 . 
  i 'm old now , shit do n't apply to me . 
  there are like 50 lithuanian redditors , so that 's not likelly to be the case . 
  same here, 
  bottled water for when you want something in the middle of the town and it 's blazzing hot . 
  never at home . 
  do n't remember meeting one in my hometown . 
  not `` that many '' of them in vilnius , but they 're there . 
  the smaller the town / the least `` western '' the town , the less graffiti . 
  it 'd take effort to find a house without any graffiti in say vilnius . 
  the only non-indo european , native european languages that i can think of are the finno-ugrics . 
  i was n't even aware that basque is n't an indo european language . 
  lithuania , hottest it got was around 38 , as far as my memory is concerned . 
  it fucking sucked . 
  functionally non-existant . 
  effectively the same here . 
  `` it 's germany 's problem , not ours . '', 
  the people in question are already dead . 
  but they were glad to see a free lithuania and were hopeful towards the future . 
  when there 's no sun for half the year and you have to deal with -30 c temperatures ... you tend to adapt . 
  well , have fun singing this , but i like it . 
  yes . 
  they suck and are a nuisance/joke as far as most people are concerned . 
  it 's really only the lithuanian majors and the deeply patriotic that approve of the shit they 're pulling . 
  it 's only about 10-20times a year that i exceed 50km in the same day . 
  if i have to spend more than say 4ish hours behind the wheel , imma say fuck it and fly . 
  200 miles is basically my entire country , lengthwise . 
  hmm , yes . 
  the situation they come from sucks . 
  and ? 
  the fuck do i care ? 
  granted i 'm not from calais and i 'm from a country these migrants would n't ever want to go to in the first place , so my position towards that matter is rather distant . 
  it i would imagine close to 100 % , you ca n't really function in it via lithuanian . 
  hell , is n't like 75 % of it knowing how to google and slack ? 
  you 'd be hard pressed to go somewhere without english in that environment . 
  absolutely everything . 
  `` the average joe '' only knows the names of the president , the pm and who the leading party is . 
  that 's about it . 
  i do n't really know how greek names sound , so i ca n't honestly compare . 
  hmm . 
  i see progress . 
  i see a lot of it actually . 
  honestly , in my short conception of time , every year is a bit better than the last . 
  both economically , politically and socially . 
  compared to the shit show i remember from the 90s , this is leagues ahead . 
  however , the question remains whether that progress is enough , and to that , i do n't have a clear cut answer . 
  vardas vardenis is n't really used , the modern one is vardenis pavardenis . 
  still , that term is closer to john doe . 
  a legal term for a person , not an actual person . 
  petras petraitis and jonas jonaitis are actual people with a stereotypical name , i.e. 
  john smith . 
  my sis married an asian , my cousins respectively married a pole and a dutch and a brit . 
  so the answer would likelly be that my family line does n't give a fuck ? 
  honestly ? 
  `` problem '' . 
  granted , that 's very much a question of context . 
  but devoid of it , that 's about it .

  russia and reason do n't really mix . 
  they are an unpredictable lot . 
  1990 after the fall of the soviet union . 
  no disputes that i know of , well perhaps vilnius , but i doubt that even the poles take that one seriously . 
  as far as we are concerned . 
  russia is definitely not european and definitely not asian . 
  russia is russian , it is unique in and of itself . 
  cash is used for dinner and the like , or when exchanging stuff between people . 
  e-money for everything else . 
  it is a concept that is connected entirely with the anglosphere here .
