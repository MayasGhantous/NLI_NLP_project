if you look at the colour of the leaves , most of the pictures are from late september/early october . 
  source : i live here, 
  the suffix is - uk - and - as is the ending , by the way . 
  this is quite sad . 
  i guess everything must come to an end , though . 
   polish is just second hardest language in the world depends on what language you speak . 
  since i speak russian and lithuanian , polish is one of the easier ones to learn . 
  i really hope lithuanian football reaches a higher level and , hopfully , not in expense of basketball . 
  lithuanian : indian summer - bob\u0173 vasara ( summer of ( older ) women ) milky way - pauk\u0161\u010di\u0173 takas ( path of birds ) the sunshower - do n't know if there 's a term for that simultaneous rain and snow - \u0161lapdriba, 
  yeah but he does n't sing about budapest at all, 
  since i 'm new to reddit can someone tell me what they think about my country , lithuania ? 
  i do n't understand what that song has to do with budapest though . 
  lovely city , 
  do the same with '' [ country ] + woman '', 
  you 're right about basketball being huge here , but i did n't think that we 'd get to the final after the poor start . 
  dude , chill . 
  i did n't say he should have hidden anything :d, 
  that 's true but there was definitely no foul in that particular episode . 
  unfortunately , we can not blame him for the loss :d, 
  silver is an amazing and unexpected result for lithuania . 
  spain had a fantastic game , it seemed like every one of their shots went in . 
  gorgeous . 
  also , there are no penguins in the north pole . 
  mcahmed sounds cool, 
  effect *, 
  they did [ change the flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_belarusian_flags#historical_flags ) after independence but in 1995 they brought back the old soviet one ( just without the communist symbols ) . 
  what 's wrong with geneva airport ? 
  the correct word for someone from slovakia is `` slovak '' , i think , 
  why is n't the whole of russia shown ? 
  there 's even a theory that the name suomi itself has baltic origins  more about it here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland#etymology, 
  interesting indeed !, 
  can anyone link to more of these ? 
  sorry , i mean to say that the words that have the ` c ' are not germanic in origin , they mostly come from latin ( e.g. 
  all the words you listed ) . 
  i may be wrong , though . 
  same for lithuanian !, 
  it 's kind of hard to realise that letters like ` h ' and ` f ' ( also , ` ch ' and maybe some other combinations ) can only be found in foreign words . 
  yeah , but are those words dutch in origin ? 
  exactly !, 
  these maps are actually ** really good ** . 
  there 's no need to be butthurt if there are some minor inaccuracies . 
  right !, 
  i remember this word would pop up very often in elementary school . 
  how different is it from estonian ? 
  can you understand it ? 
  this is a really well-done map . 
  that 's basically it . 
  just try not to use too much oil . 
  fried black bread with garlic is heaven if done well . 
  i am confused . 
  you may be right . 
  it would be interesting if this would be proposed in lithuania . 
  is there any particular reason or explanation as to why these measures are in place ? 
  great video !, 
  do people really drive with their headlights on in daylight , though ? 
  i do n't disagree . 
  i think she just wanted to make a comprehensible example . 
  it would be very interesting to see such a map on a european scale . 
  so far it 's really great , 
  * les mis\u00e9rables * by victor hugo, 
  why do all danish soldiers have beards ? 
  i saw some of them a while back in lithuania and all of them had amazing beards . 
  not mutually intelligible . 
  same in lithuania basically . 
  no one i know uses whatsapp here in lithunia . 
  pretty much everyone uses facebook messenger or just regular sms . 
  loved it !, 
  i would definitely like to see something like this done for other countries !, 
  come on , r/europe !, 
  also i forgot to mark malta , which also ends with - a. 
  and also luxembourg , the vatican , san marino , monaco , cyprus and liechtenstein . 
  [ same map for lithuanian . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/jwnpceq ) the uk is either `` jungtin\u0117 karalyst\u0117 '' or `` did\u017eioji britanija '' and the netherlands either `` nyderlandai '' or `` olandija '' . 
  can you elaborate ? 
  also i believe that up north people always pronounce the o 's , whereas normally you would pronounce the unstressed o 's like a 's , e.g. 
  in the north the word \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 would be pronounced g ** o ** l ** o ** va instead of g ** a ** l ** a ** va everywhere else . 
  true . 
  belgium is on the warmer side here . 
  but the further inland you go , [ the colder it gets during the winter ] ( http://web.ornl.gov/sci/knowledgediscovery/wargaming/europe/europe_jantemp2000.jpg ) . 
  in winter it 's actually warmer in iceland than in much of the continent . 
  the russian version of google maps and wikipedia say that it 's called \u041c\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u044b \u041b\u0443\u0438\u0437\u044b ( queen louise bridge ) , too . 
  interesting . 
  in lithuanian , `` nu '' is used in similar ways . 
  you 've also got the driest desert in the world . 
  which is strange because veliky novgorod ( `` great new city '' , litterally ) is one of the oldest cities in russia ( founded in 859 ) . 
  though it should not be mistaken for nizhny novgorod ( `` lower new city '' ) , which was founded in 1221 , and is much larger today . 
  where do people fit their cars ? 
  i would say dorne fits iberia quite well because not all dornish are heavily tanned . 
  look at arthur dayne . 
  i remember reading that the people of dorne are divided into three groups according to geography and they are slightly distinct from each other in their facial features and skin tone . 
  i would put qarth in arabia , probably . 
  it has a certain aladdin feel . 
  should be `` peris '' for lithuanian . 
  looks like the grand canyon or something from the thumbnail . 
  nice , did n't think these sort of landscapes existed in ireland . 
  what 's wrong with german police ? 
  thanks . 
  that does make sense , thanks . 
  this might be off-topic but why is his surname written like that ( halla - ** a ** ho ) ? 
  should n't it be halla - ** a ** ho if it 's a double surname ?
