  i certainly do . 
  i am also have a european passport , of a nation that i 'll leave you guys to guess . 
  i 'm supposed to prove a negative , that russia * did n't * shoot down a plane ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  the commentators in this question have just gone full-retard . 
  he was a spy . 
  a goddamn spy who turned against russia . 
  if we have our senators and congressman in the us calling for the execution or assassination for a hero like snowden , imagine the feelings towards a rat who sells out his country for a nice house and fat paycheque in london ? 
  good . 
  for their stupid haughty revolution that overthrew a democratically elected president that half of the country was against anyway , i say fuck them , they deserve to be buried in their debt for their stupid nato/eusa crusade to stick two fingers to russia . 
  they deserve this , this will be the new reality for biting the imf/eu biscuit , for installing a us-backed dictator without the consent of the people ( i 'm talking about arseniy ` yatz ' yatsenyuk , who to this day remains the most [ powerful unelected leader in ukraine ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2014/02/27/washingtons-man-yatsenyuk-setting-ukraine-up-for-ruin/ ) ) -- welcome to eternal austerity , ukraine !!!, 
  no one deserves it more than you , for no one else has anyone to blame for your ( mis ) fortunes !, 
  you ca n't prove that russia shot down the plane , and not even your nato buddies can . 
  you 're just spouting bs eusa propaganda now . 
  probably because the british hate us with a passion , is that so shocking ? 
  * crickets *, 
  your jokes are n't funny . 
  i 'm saying it does n't matter , unless you happen to be a woman . 
  emotions do n't win wars and do n't build cohesive societies . 
  no , i mean it literally happens all the time , to many countries , not just russia . 
  it does n't mean a declaration of war is imminent , nor does it mean the country has an intent to spy ( how much spying can one do with a bomber anyway ? 
  kinda obvious in my humble opinion ) . 
  it means that people who are flying planes * all by themselves * who are responsible for very powerful machines occasionally go off course . 
  people have made stupider mistakes with less explanation readily available , such as the time switzerland [ accidentally invaded lichtenstein ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/international/story?id=2921407 ) . 
  no one was ` assassinated on the streets of london ' , legally , they ca n't even prove that russia was behind it ( personally i think they were -- but that 's what you get for being a double-agent to your own country , aye ? ), 
   `` we do n't want to fight but by jingo if we do we 've got the ships , we 've got the men , we 've got the money too we 've fought the bear before , and while we 're britons true the russians shall not have constantinople . '', 
  wow , never heard that poem before , and i did n't know british chauvinist hatred of russia literally dated back to the russian-turkish war . 
  as an ethnic irish-russian with both british and american passports , it makes perfect sense why they hate me so much now and look as if they want to pelt fruit at me !, 
  thanks !, 
  my post history does n't suggest anything of the sort . 
  it suggests i have some ( what would be considered in western europe ) extremist views , but i can assure you they are all my own . 
  that 's not the uk , and not your concern . 
  your second example happens all the time . 
  russia got too close to alaska once , it does n't mean they want to declare war on the us . 
  god you 're a dolt . 
  litvenenko was a kgb turned mi6 agent , posing as a journalist . 
  i do n't see innocent britons being targeted , merely people who are obviously asking for it by involving themselves in clandestine intelligence work . 
   `` you can tell the world i hate finland . 
  it 's too cold , there 's no tea , no restaurants , no bars , nobody on the streets , only cars , '' 22-year-old muhammed told afp in tornio , he should go home to ~ ~ bangladesh ~ ~ ~ ~ afghanistan ~ ~ ~ ~ nigeria ~ ~ ~ ~ nepal ~ ~ syria then , where he will be certain to find zero bars ( alcohol being banned in islamic controlled areas ) and will almost certainly find employment as a land-mine clearance agent . 
  because except for wanting to punish the wealthy and the renationalisation schemes , the rest of it is n't that bad or objectionable, 
  i see . 
  now list all the bad things about jeremy corbyn . 
  that 's probably because it is a mexican flag , pea-brain, 
  what does that even mean ? 
  are you drunk ? 
  lay off the sauce , you 're drunk, 
  hungarians do n't want to end up like the palestinians , where they have people from other nations building walls in their homeland to keep them out of their own ancestral birthright . 
  who cares about `` humanising '' ? 
  and the israeli apartheid wall is a different thing altogether , that is a foreign people building a wall in * your * native land -- the hungarian border is meant to keep undesirables out of * their * native land so they do n't end up like the palestinians , yeah ? 
  except of course , putin * is * protecting russian citizens in ukraine . 
  do you see any dead bodies in crimea yet ? 
  why not ? 
  they 're under russian protection !, 
  i always love it when british people call americans fat with a haughty sense of superiority ; since the difference in obesity is mere percentage points ( and britain does n't have a massive ethnic population that greatly contributes to the obesity figures ) , it 's like when the wheelchair guy makes fun of the guy with cerebral palsy at the retard olympics . 
  and in my personal experience anyway , having lived in both , britain is * far * fatter than the united states , though my experience is limited to merseyside and the surrounding area . 
  lol finnish humour !, 
   ~ ~ hungarians ~ ~ i hate americans and their ~ ~ stupid staged propaganda bullshit ~ ~ ability to get all the chicks at my local bar when they appear on holiday fix 'd, 
   ~ ~ hungarians ~ ~ i hate americans and their ~ ~ stupid propaganda ~ ~ clever sense of humour . 
  fix 'd that for ya . 
   , they are actually putting up flag post there . 
  you realise that they 're doing it in the style of an [ iconic american image ] ( http://www.montney.com/marine/iwo.jpg ) , right ? 
  it seems i know more about europe sitting on my cloud in california than you do pretending to live in germany . 
  i 'll just politely file this under * ignore *, 
  it 's almost like the germans * want * the mass third world migration influx, 
  `` european solidarity '' is a pr message manufactured by the european leaders to get everyone on board with the european project ; it never actually existed , as the treatment of greece can demonstrate to you . 
  i agree , it is n't funny . 
  hungary is a nation under siege , and the border is meant to protect the hungarian way of life . 
  serbians are [ not worried ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocw3fbqpqku ) . 
  people do n't want funding , they want the migrants to go home . 
  money does n't make communities more cohesive . 
  this will be amusing . 
  expect no change , because putin is not an emotive dolt who 'll change course because some washed-up 80 's celebrity gives him a harsh tutting . 
  the foreign minister is in the correct completely regarding building the border fence and wanting to keep refugees out ; hungary is a small , unique nation with a unique language , unique culture and history , and * tens of thousands * of refugees coming * daily * is a threat to the cohesiveness of the hungarian nation . 
  also , what the hell is that thing in the interviewer 's nose ? 
  the eu is done for , both as a cohesive free-movement zone , and as an economic co-prosperity sphere . 
  you now have hungarians building a border fence which is slowly leading to the collapse of the schengen zone , zero unity on the refugees/economic migrants pouring into europe by the thousands daily , and increasingly , nations wanting to escape the german hegemony that is bringing misery to europe , especially to her smaller nations . 
  the eu project has failed , i reiterate . 
  good . 
  they can all go home now . 
  trying to abolish the nuclear trident defence is utterly retarded , and something that no one should take seriously . 
  besides , keeping trident also helps prevent scots from claiming that independence will make them a nuclear free zone , since scotland would still be under the nuclear umbrella , exposing the hypocrisy . 
  russia once again leading the way on humanitarian issues , doing the walk ( saying no to bombing the middle east , saying yes to peace with iran , etc. ), 
  and not just talking the talk for the sake of looking good for the cameras . 
  russia is more of a leader than the us or eu ever will be . 
  perhaps she was just pissed at the foreign hordes running over her border . 
  i posted it in seriousness , because the only ones to laugh at are faggots like you -- though i suppose it 'd be funnier if you were n't destroying civilisation 2 . ), 
  why am * i * the `` lonely and pathetic '' one in this ? 
  faggots and trannies are the deranged sickos with the sky-high suicide rates and mental disorders ( aside from their glaringly obvious one ) , so it would be more appropriate to.say someone such as * yourself * is dying without mother 's love ; 3 . ), 
  comment stalking is creepy , and weird . 
  do n't make the obvious any more.glaring . 
   * heavily implying that racism against muslims is n't also motivated by their alien `` foreignness '' and dark skin and what 's wrong with targeting an ethnicity ? 
  charlie hebdo did it with the french ( particularily , algerian ) arabs over and over and over ... 
   we as a society decided that denying deaths of 6 millions of people , whether they were jews , arabs or atheists for the matter is heinous , and should not be allowed . 
  whereas we decided that caricaturing people , fictitious or not , is perfectly fine . 
  lol !, 
  please . 
  ** most of europe ( not to mention israel ) does n't even recognise the genocide committed against armenians by turkish nationalists in the 1910s out of fear of offending the turks , ** and you want me to believe that europe is some altruistic , egalitarian , equal-opportunity society that cares about justice and the accurate depiction of history ? 
  holocaust denial laws are there because of the power , money and influence of the jewish lobby , pure and simple . 
  i am not even going to read the rest of your post . 
  if you could n't get that part right , i highly doubt you have anything else worth saying .
