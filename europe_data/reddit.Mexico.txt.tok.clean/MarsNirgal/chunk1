well , imagine being suicidal alcoholic without free speech ... and on the top of that - someone fcking you in the ass . 
  : / sent to / r/nocontext, 
  there go the estonian aspirations to be nordic ... 
  just for the sake of it , i decided to do this on google mexico , using the structure : `` por qu\u00e9 x es ... '' . 
  here are the suggestions : albania : the poorest country in europe andorra : independent armenia : the first christian country austria : a developed country azerbaijan : the land of fire belarus : no answer ( lol ) belgium : love so cruel . 
  ( this has to do with a song by mexican singer [ ricardo arjona named `` por qu\u00e9 es tan cruel el amor ( why love is so cruel ? ) '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epynkdpqbs0 ) ) . 
  it 's gon na appear a couple more times . 
  bosnia and herzegovina : named like that bulgaria : an underdeveloped country croatia : an underdeveloped country cyprus : divided czech republic : a developed country denmark : the happiest country estonia : africa . 
  ( google is mixing up `` por qu\u00e9 estonia es '' and `` porque esto es africa '' , the spanish lyrics of shakira 's [ waka waka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzsue5ugxf4 ) ) finland : love so cruel . 
  france : target of terrorist attacks georgia : poor germany : a world power . 
  greece : important hungary : good at soccer iceland : the happiest country in the world ireland : a developed country italy : love so cruel . 
  kosovo : no suggestions . 
  latvia : no suggestions . 
  liechtenstein : so rich . 
  lithuania : no suggestions . 
  luxembourg : a rich country . 
  macedonia : made of fruits . 
  ( there is a fruit salad named `` macedonia '' in latin america ) malta : good/harmful/an aromatic drink . 
  ( three top suggestions ) moldova : a poor country monaco : a principality . 
  montenegro : no suggestions . 
  netherlands : called like that . 
  norway : a developed country . 
  poland : europe 's mexico . 
  [ i 'm not kidding . 
  romania : poor . 
  russia : so big . 
  san marino : independent . 
  serbia : not in the european union . 
  slovakia : an undeveloped country . 
  slovenia : an undeveloped country ( second suggestion was `` a developed country '' ) spain : love so cruel . 
  sweden : a developed country . 
  switzerland : neutral . 
  turkey : love so cruel . 
  ukraine : important for russia . 
  united kingdom ( uk ) : a developed country . 
  vatican : said to be a mafia . 
  let 's move latvia to the iberian peninsula . 
  right . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  mexico is only slightly stronger than texas in terms of economy , and i think we might be weaker in military stregth , so it would be a damn bad idea to try that . 
  i guess we could merge , but it would be an entirely different process . 
  quesadillas are a mexican dish that consist in a folded tortilla filled with stuff . 
  in all the country except the capital , the stuff inside must have cheese for it to be considered a quesadilla ( otherwise they 're known as `` dobladita '' ) . 
  in the capital , however , they 're considered quesadillas whether they have cheese or not , and it 's something we 're mocked for in the rest of the country . 
  ( most of the times , like here , it 's done in a quite light spirited way and we all enjoy it ) i am from the capital , but i think the rest of the country has a strong point heres . 
  after all , `` queso '' means cheese , so it seems logical thar quesadillas must have cheese . 
  thanks a lot for your answers !, 
  about the last point : do you think the differences between two individual frenchmen , for example , would matter more or less than de differences between a frenchman ans , say , a german or a greek ? 
  yeah , i know . 
  in mexican spanish we usually call the continent `` america '' as well , and sometimes we get a little uncomfortable with the u.s calling themselves `` america '' . 
  ( it depends a lot on the person . 
  i know many mexicans who have no problem at all with that ), 
  the biggest differences i can think with spain : * where spaniards use `` vosotros '' we use `` ustedes '' . 
  the verb conjugation changes accordingly , they say `` vosotros hac\u00e9is '' and we say `` ustedes hacen '' . 
  * spaniards use a lot more the composite past : `` he hecho '' instead of `` hice '' . 
  ( they reserve simple past for things that are well in the past ) . 
  * one of my favorites : spanish students `` give class '' and the teacher `` takes the class '' , while mexican students `` take class '' and the teacher `` gives the class '' . 
  * there are , of course , words that have different meanings . 
  `` coger '' in spain means just `` to take '' or `` to grab '' , while in mexico it has those meanings , but it also means `` to fuck . '', 
  * spaniards curse a lot more . 
  we use more double entendre . 
  now about music , prepare yourself for a flood of awesome . 
  i 'm gon na give you a lot of artists , each with a whole playlist ( or a loooooong video with a lot of songs ) and then a couple links to my favorite song/s of each artist . 
  because mexican music , that 's what . 
  folk : [ vicente fern\u00e1ndez ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpg2hpobsmw&amp;list=plc91adb8ace3c4e3c ) is one of our most iconic folk singers . 
  here 's [ mujeres divinas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfx0ijwj1mw ) [ pedro infante ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9whpppg0ak ) was an actor and singer and the incarnation of the golden age of mexican cinema . 
  here 's [ b\u00e9same morenita ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ompjonw-y94 ) and a funny duet with [ jorge negrete ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khehw0dtwnw ) [ lucha villa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j4mmybyi6o&amp;list=plee8688c1287b9a25 ) ( i have n't heard that much of her , sadly ) a little less known , but i love her , [ estela n\u00fa\u00f1ez ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amv9x-q69_c ) my favorite song from her is probably [ el sauce y la palma ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kxlgqwjkqe ) [ marco antonio mu\u00f1iz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzn0fvdsn20&amp;list=pl0dzg7zlu-kaewh6mncraeny6tj73_mez ) . 
  my favorite song from him is actually not mexican but puerto rican : [ lamento borincano . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj1925v7hew ) [ tr\u00edo los panchos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37g9om5rnuq ) ( trios are a fixture of mexican folk music , los panchos are the most famous of them ) . 
  here are they singing [ quiz\u00e1s , quiz\u00e1s , quiz\u00e1s . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdj0klj3pmq ) [ alejandro fern\u00e1ndez ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05dcxpp62bq&amp;list=pl3eb848b98a657de0 ) ( he 's kinda modern folk mixed with pop , and he 's in my opinion a great vocalist ) my favorite song from him is , hands down , [ como quien pierde una estrella . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxlwuz_nek0 ) oldies but goodies : [ jos\u00e9 jos\u00e9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2icmnlt8b8 ) , one of the greatest vocalists from mexico . 
  it 's hard to pick a song from him , but i 'd go for [ m\u00e1s . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvoliycefq4 ) [ armando manzanero ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f5mjsfxwig ) . 
  not my favorite song , but i 'm gon na brag that [ somos novios ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clu-0tphxiy ) is the original version of `` it 's impossible '' by perry como . 
  [ luis miguel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-wsjskgoa8 ) ( this is kinda folk/pop , btw ) i like a lot his version of [ mi ciudad . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juq9vyl31gu ) ( yes , he officialy qualifies as `` oldies but goodies '' . 
  no one tell him ) pop : i 've been a lot of touch with mexican pop because i mostly hear european pop ( specifically , eurovision . 
  you do n't know how jealous i am that you guys are in eurovision and we are n't ) , so most of the pop i post will be slightly dated ( or very dated in some cases ) [ gloria trevi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjxbluryhe4&amp;list=plis-nm3fm9amet6qkht596kxq5l3mbwdm ) . 
  she 's an extremely controversial artists by farily good reasons . 
  always since she started her career she pushed the boundaries of political correctness . 
  in the early nineties she released a string of widely successful and polemic discs in which she discussed religion , abortion , sex and a lot of other stuff mexican society was n't comfortable discussing . 
  then in 2000 she was arrested an accused of being part of a ring of child abuse that involved most of her backup singers and dancers . 
  then she got pregnant in prison , she claimed that she was raped while the prison authorities claimed she got smuggled sperm from her manager and faked the abuse . 
  at the end she was released for lack of evidence , and after ten years out of the spotlight , she returned stronger than ever . 
  she 's still quite controversial , with people believing that she was part of the abuse ring , while others believe she was a victim of it . 
  i prefer not to think about it and just enjoy her music . 
  a lot of her more current songs deal with self-reliance and liberation , which is something i like a lot . 
  also , she 's become a gay icon , kinda like the mexican lady gaga ( except she was doing gaga before gaga was doing solid food ) i would be hard-pressed to name a single song of her , so i 'll put several . 
  i hope you enjoy : * [ todos me miran ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7kh2gwl8g ) * [ me r\u00edo de ti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6a-kw41eek ) * [ lo que una chica por amor es capaz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfukpd3ioa ) * [ sabes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scgrh7ibg6k ) * [ no soy un p\u00e1jaro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknnh7u90fa ) ( warning : this song is heavy on double entendres and sexual innuendo . 
  it 's the kind of thing only she would dare to sing ) also , a classic from my childhood is the kid/youth band [ timbiriche . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sc7xgsnhy4&amp;list=pl2e6a9599e3c49158&amp;index=2 ) my favorite song from them is [ si no es ahora . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=covfi2ij39o ) [ ov7 and kabah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmytefifbx0&amp;list=pljmhkrttbctypvnujwskinxgaboeifors ) are a couple bands that were quite succesfful . 
  ( sorry , i found a joint playlist and i 'm feeling kinda lazy ) . 
  ov7 was formed as `` onda vaselina '' a long time ago but then they lost the rights to their name in a dispute with their managers , so now they just go for the initials . 
  my favorite song from them is [ un pie tras otro pie . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=busfo75x3na ) . 
  about kabah i 'm gon na go for what i know and give you a song from a former member , [ no soy una se\u00f1ora ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5t1cyy-s8e ) by mar\u00eda jos\u00e9 . 
  garibaldi is already vintage , ( late eighties , early nineties ) , my favorite songs from them are [ que te la pongo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umdbmstbuls ) y [ tengo una bolita ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfrd9cidujk ) . 
  paulina rubio is quite a successful singer .
