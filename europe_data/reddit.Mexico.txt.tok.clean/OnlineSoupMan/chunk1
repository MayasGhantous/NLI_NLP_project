finally estonia can into happys only thing they need now is to become nordic for maximum happys, 
  yep, 
  they just sometimes annex land by accident !, 
  honest mistake guys !, 
  yeah there would be short term problems , like leaders getting their political careers sorta tarnished , but if it would still somewhat clear out animosity between countries , and allow growth to happen . 
  i do n't know man . 
  this entire situation sucks, 
  nothing much , but it would scare russia from doing stuff, 
  edited, 
  yeah , i know , i 'm just saying that any coup attempts are scary stuff . 
  but a guy said that it was probs fake , so just ignore me, 
  well i guess fuck him ? 
  i do n't know man . 
  yeah i know him , he 's kind off a dick , but it 's still scary shit . 
  i do n't like my president ( pe\u00f1a nieto ) , but if i learned that he could have been assassinated and the government replaced , i would be scared edit : apparently this whole thing might have been orchestrated . 
  nevermind, 
   the plotters were allegedly going to dress in police uniforms to storm the montenegrin parliament in podgorica , shoot the prime minister , milo \u00d0jukanovi\u0107 , and install a pro-moscow party . 
  i hope montenegro joins nato quick , this shit is fucking scary, 
  it 's like belgium . 
  it 's not real !, 
  he lives and breathes shitposts, 
  it 's funny though , because if turkey and erdo actually went and apologized for what the ottoman empire did , it would have a much more positive impact than just denying it all . 
  they could start rebuilding bridges , instead of just sitting around doing nothing . 
  that is a beautiful saying . 
  poetry at its finest !, 
  it 's germany , being efficient is all they know !, 
  ( jokes ), 
  hoy many militant groups are they supporting ? 
  ger ** many !, 
  ** ( it 's just a joke do n't take it seriously ), 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  guess i jumped the gun a bit the did i ? 
  like i said to the other canadian above , it just passed me off that he compared germany to apartheid . 
  it just pisses me off when people say that a country is `` just like apartheid '' it 's just scummy, 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  are you impliyng that just because i 'm from a country that was a former colony , i would admire everything europe does and ignore all racism ? 
  bruh , i 'm literally the first person to complain whenever an european country does something stupid , and if racism happens , i would also be the first to complain . 
  but that does n't even matter because the only reason you said that was so you could dodge actually talking about what you just said , which is comparing apartheid south africa to germany , which is an absolutely ludicrous idea . 
   de facto apartheid state fuck you . 
  germany is * nothing * like apartheid you two bit fucking dumbass . 
  turks in germany are n't fucking killed because of their religion . 
  turks in germany are allowed to go to school , black apartheid south africans could n't do that . 
  turks in germany can get jobs , black apartheid south africans couldnt do that . 
  turks with german citizenship can vote , black apartheid south africans could n't . 
  turks can speak their mind , black south africans could n't . 
  you know nothing about apartheid . 
  do n't you dare compare it to germany . 
  beer ? 
  not wholesome ? 
  in * germany ?!, 
  * that ca n't be true !, 
  so i decided to look at his wikipedia page , and  his personal wealth is around 10.000.000 # , and he is listed among twenty richest world leaders , while source of his wealth is regarded as `` mysterious '' per british independent yup, 
   do n't trust any russian , do n't go to russia voluntarily . 
  mate ya need to chill, 
  that 's a bit extreme innit ? 
  an entire country full of people can not be one monolithic force of bad . 
  the government can be mostly bad , but to claim that everything is bad is plain ridiculous, 
  he even banned google once, 
  [ since this ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9pcybcpkm5c ), 
   something related to russia the comments here are gon na be gold are n't they ? 
  they 've made some nice cars ? 
  idk man, 
   the international court of justice , cleared the republic of serbia of direct involvement in genocide , but found that it had failed to prevent mass killings , rapes , and ethnic cleansing . 
  they were n't involved directly , but they still allowed it to happen [ source ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/02/26/idusl26638724._ch_.2400 ), 
  yeah i know it probably wo n't change his opinion , but there is a slight chance it will , and that 's all that matters, 
  [ a variety of war crimes ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbia_in_the_yugoslav_wars#war_crimes ) and a few genocides [ here ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_genocide ) and [ here ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/srebrenica_massacre ), 
  to be fair it probably sucks , but it probably is n't worthy of tons of guys going in and giving it a 1/10 . 
  it 's springtime for hitler all over again !, 
  we 're talking about poop shades here lad . 
  i 'm pretty sure green people do n't exist, 
  but that does n't excuse what the serbian government did at all . 
  genocide is never a rational response to anything . 
  your current state of being appears to be bean bungled !, 
  do n't forget brazilians mate i can still hear the huehuehues ... 
  how would being rich and gay be a bad thing ? 
  that 's like , the most european thing you can be !, 
  also he needs those face ski masks, 
  yeah , that kinda sucks . 
  that 's actually really clever , i did n't even notice that i thought it was just a vacation add for business men, 
  yeah , but people should be allowed to choose if they want their kid to go to a one gender school or two gender school . 
  as a parent you should be allowed to decide what is best for your kid , even if you are wrong , it 's still your right . 
  these people want to straight up ban mixed schools , which would remove that choice . 
  but that would make sense !, 
  which is why they wo n't do it !, 
  what a time to be alive, 
  eh , what can you do, 
  quick lads !!!, 
  it 's something related to russia !!!, 
  let 's argue loudly on the comments for four hours now !!, 
  i thought it was a potato wonderland, 
  [ basically ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/098/090/747.jpg ), 
  did n't the chinese have a thing where they would pay 50 cents to people so they defended them on the internet ? 
  welcome to / r/europe where arguments are plenty , and logic is mostly forgotten !, 
  actually the closest bit of land on the opposite side of the earth would be [ new zealand ] ( http://www.peakbagger.com/pbgeog/worldrev.aspx ), 
  it 's rather catchy, 
  [ its a meme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgm39cwesj4 ), 
  he has no grace !, 
  th-th-th-this qatar is a fucking disgrace !, 
  dang that sucks, 
  brainwashing !,
