  if that actually happens it would literally be the biggest 3d chess move on earth, 
  i 've eaten mexican food before and i can confirm mexico is delicious, 
  golden hair gold or golden shower gold ? 
  is n't jerusalem disputed and stuff though ? 
  like , they annexed it in 1967 , but no one recognized that annexation . 
  so moving guys to live in disputed land is kinda controversial, 
  yeah if i 'm honest , things are sorta kinda in a way looking up . 
  stuff still suck a lot sometimes , but there is progress being made . 
  oh , well i guess that 's a good reason to use it . 
  i do n't really have any long distance friends , so i find facebook kinda useless, 
  society is sad, 
  so everyone will use a mediocre site just because everyone is using a mediocre site ? 
  that 's kinda sad, 
  i never really understood why facebook is popular . 
  it just seems like a more cumbersome way of getting information or talking with friends , when you could just use other websites or apps that are faster and better, 
  more like mexi ** no **, 
  well , it 's not really a wall . 
  more like a fence, 
  the russian national motto also the mexican one, 
  do they have a spanish version ? 
  i speak braille, 
  nah man , i 'm pretty sure the meme economy has n't recovered after the harambe crash of '16, 
   news story that is negative towards russia fake blyat . 
  is fake western propaganda of europe homogender devil who want to insult glorius rosya / s, 
  holy shit this is actually really inspiring and awesome kudos to the guy, 
  that 's normal man . 
  r/news is n't a good place to actually discuss politics . 
  or anything , really, 
  walls , small hands , and golden shower jokes go right here, 
  [ / u/onlinesoupman has been banned from / r/europe for 100000 years ], 
  i read a lot of polandball, 
  itunes is legit one of the worst music services i 've ever used in my life . 
  i 'm happy that they did n't get bought out, 
  well , to be honest , most mexicans do n't even know the balkans exist, 
  not even that much money to be honest ... 
  i also did nazi that one coming but in all seriousness , berlin is pretty friccin cool . 
  wish i could visit, 
  maybe they ca n't afford it ? 
  well i do n't know , i asume they are thirsty, 
  arguing over who gets to keep a cup full of piss, 
  protest demanding the right to protest for the right to protest the right to protest, 
  i know right ? 
  instead of being reasonable , the serb gov is acting like a petty child , sending paper plane messages filled with insult to a kid they do n't like , and somehow expecting that kid to magically like them again . 
  this is ridiculous, 
  you 're all together in the balkans , the most disfunctional family on earth, 
   oh hey a guy said something slightly negative about russia , better call him a nazi i did `` nazi '' that one coming, 
  because it 's not a simple slip of the toungue . 
  a minister of foreign affairs should n't fuck up what countries he goes to, 
  do n't worry , maybe he works there, 
  it 's genuinely beautiful, 
   ireland : just britain *** 1922 intensifies ***, 
  there is no proofs of airstrickes da ? 
  no proofs blyat !, 
  they even helped influence uk culture a bit , introducing different types of instruments and styles that famous musicians got inspired by , especially jamaica . 
  that 's pretty neat, 
  it 's just a flag , what could go wrong ? 
  dang , well if i happen to pass by some of those places i 'll see if i find anything, 
  do you think they can mail sweets all the way to mexico ? 
  what in your opinion is the best serb sweet ? 
  dang it it makes me sad that i will probably never taste all these balkan chocolates, 
  yo but real talk here is serb chocolate any good ? 
  fuck man , turkey does n't seem to catch a break these days, 
  hey look , erdogan did a good thing for once in his life, 
  no one is * that * desperate for one mate , not even me, 
  yeah , but it 's more amusing to think that boris somehow bumbled his way into the situation somehow . 
  like a british forest gump, 
  charlie chaplin levels of dumb luck, 
   stupidity is pregnant around here and it will have a baby soon that is the strangest way to explain it . 
  but oddly endearing . 
  visible from space !, 
  unhappy !, 
  [ this comment section right now ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/098/090/747.jpg ), 
  anyone who reads the sun and takes what they say at face value should probably reevaluate their life, 
  that 's pretty cool, 
  maybe a mexican immigrant or visitor ? 
  not sure, 
  appease him with fine german beer . 
  make sure its locally made too , they will not accept inferior imitations, 
  i wish i was paid to look good and run around naked in the forest, 
   edi rama is an albanian politician , diplomat , artist , writer and ** former basketball player ** , who has been the prime minister of albania since 2013 . 
  he is also the first serving mayor to become prime minister . 
  that is incredible, 
  and thats why everyone in finland is sad all the time, 
  he looks like a professional basketball player, 
  a mystery that will never be solved, 
  i checked his wikipedia page , and it says that his dad was of portuguese , french , and goan decent . 
  goans are an ethno linguistic group from goa , india , which used to be a portuguese province, 
  he looks like the happiest guy in all of finland, 
  for you, 
  no dude , it does n't . 
  you do n't need to latch on to another persons comment to leave your own unrelated comment . 
  it gives you the opposite of visibility by making you look kinda desperate for a response , or worse , it can make you look like a troll , or as someone trying to bait people . 
  if you want to comment something , just comment . 
  so you replied to a comment with something unrelated to the comment just because it was top post ? 
  that does n't make sense, 
  bruh it 's just a joke chill, 
  how to convince your child that masturbation is evil, 
  because i 'm easy come, 
  which infuriates me , because when the israeli government actually does end up doing something shitty , people hand wave it by saying that all complaints are just anti semitic . 
  because some assholes are anti semitic and try to act like they 're just critiquing israel , suddenly everyone who criticizes israel is anti semitic .
