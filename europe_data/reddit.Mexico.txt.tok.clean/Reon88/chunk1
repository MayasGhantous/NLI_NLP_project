well ... what can i say ? 
  each iteration is showing progress , * it 's something.jpg *, 
  by the time that master plan comes into fruition , spaniards will be extinct and y' all be * espa\u00f1ist\u00e1n * * long live third mexican empire !, 
  he/she/it doesnt need to be spanish ... 99 % of r/mexico will communicate in english if necessary . 
  you can send swedish girls if you mind ... for example . 
  well ... we have experience with that . 
  aka as * d\u00eda de la raza * on this side of the pond . 
  * goes back to lurking mode *, 
  churchception, 
  exactly !, 
  that 's why you make the * illegal one * next to the legal one ... they 'll never suspect ... 
  of course we are ... * starts digging a tunnel under la manche *, 
  chocolate or cajeta ( goat milk candy ) are the best flavros imho, 
  google up micheladas or `` tarros michelados '', 
  well ... you still can try red salsa recipes, 
  as a mexican i find this hilarious and sad at the same time :(, 
  i can share salsa recipes ... they are easy . 
  normally you drink this in the morning , as a breakfast or part of the breakfast . 
  also , this is much more common in central and south m\u00e9xico than in the northern states , we are too ** agringados ** / americanized * sobs in spanglish *, 
  you 'll love original salsa then , the real thing . 
  ahhhhhh but ye have n't had mexican salsa with any of those ... the salsa can be addictive . 
  what kind of desserts ? 
  i 've tried * avocado juice * before , some rumanians offered me while on a work travel . 
  it was ... different . 
  these guys need some real mexican food , not that utter crap called tex mex ... * cringes while typing *, 
  i wan na see brits melting down at 40 \u00b0 c summers with 70 % humidity ... 
  * shruggs in mexican *, 
  * taking notes * so ... this gibraltar ... where do i turn around ? 
  in spain or morocco ? 
  they should get their own food adjective ... we are the taco republic for example , they can be the kebab ( islamic ) republic if they wishs, 
  so ... irish people melting point temperature is around 33 \u00b0 c. . . that 's cute . 
  that 'd be more of a recuperation ^ ^ / s, 
  what can i say ? 
  we can steal your jobs but we would never be able to steal your ~ ~ reich ~ ~ union . 
  now i get it why we have that awful laundrywater here in mexico ... 
  it all arrived like `` we are gon na make heineken here in mexico and give y' all jobs ! '', 
  ironically ... mexico and latinamerica hold the largest o + concentrations . 
  you need mexicans :d, 
  * gives him budlight since he 's a blondie gringou *, 
  speako taco you !, 
  frenchmen are lawful evil after all . 
  i disagree , we take showers daily . 
   for food it would probably be something like : netherlands  france  belgium  switzerland  england  germany where 's spain & italy ? 
  romance countries tend to have the best cuisines in europe . 
  i think we take that a step further with pozole and tamales . 
  as a jam\u00f3n serrano , i vote for m\u00e9xico . 
  we replace them in the map for a couple of weeks ... then we moved back next to their spoiled child . 
  basically proto-muricans . 
  as a mexican , seafood tacos are a common thing in the coasts . 
  mexican tovarisch ... confused boner for trump . 
  i understood that reference . 
  and the immediate twitter from the cheeto overlord . 
  maybe the 10 m2 personal space between them . 
  tex-mex ai n't mexican food . 
  actually , there is a wall/fence already there ... btw , good luck with global warming , dansk will probably disappear * laughs in mexican *, 
  infatti , parlo italiano , le due sono molto simili :d mexican rice is nice , the holy grail of mexican rice comes when you make `` caldo tlalpe\u00f1o '' , google that shit please . 
  no , we hovered back to this side of the pond . 
  i know y' all missed us :d, 
  i 'll jump the wall in the meantime ... 
  i 've seen italians lost their shit while trying mexican food . 
  as a mexican , i 'd rather visit hungary or ukraine than going to italy , spain , france or germany if i 'm on vacations . 
  greece looks like a raisin . 
  or any latin/romance ; you can pin point latin/romances by their voice level and hand gestures almost anywhere . 
  the beef sirloin looks cute and tasty . 
  is that common , normal people , day by day food or fancy , little finger rising food ? 
  that 's why y' all people are always angry !, 
  your food looks angry !, 
   i prefer real spanish food , like tacos , burritos , etc * encabronamiento intensifies *, 
  * laughs in mexican , at 37 \u00b0 c with 62 % humidity *, 
  after leaving parenthood maybe . 
  easy go, 
  i understand the situation for portugal & spain , but can someone eli25 the situation for italy and poland ? 
  we have fire resistance , what can i say ... 
  tacos . 
  los angeles is the branch store of mexico capital city in the us , just saying , there are more mexicans there than in any other city besides the capital . 
  guadalajara , guadalupe , guadalquivir , all of them mean `` river of/from '' + something else . 
  we haven zillion towns with guadalupe in their names over here . 
  not european but if i were , i 'd propose to allow them return to eu only if they beat mexican/italian/french / spanish cuisine with an islander dish ( and by islander i mean their island ) . 
  kinda like a hunger games mixed with master chef trial . 
  that was mostly portrayed to argentina and chile , on this side . 
  blasphemy is not so common in mexico , yet we have a lot of parolacce anche, 
  i just spat my coffee after reading this , thanks for that . 
  i believe this slang word is shared among most of latin america . 
  there are several slangs , the other most common is * paja/pajear ( se ) * . 
  if you say * paja mental * or * chaqueta mental * , almost all the * hispanohablantes * will understand you . 
  at r/mexico we oftenly use * spanglish * terms , but sometimes we translate word by word or coin new phrases : * ** shitpost ** = mierda post , pretty obvious for romance language speakers . 
  * ** upvote ** = arrivoto , * arrivotear * is the infinitive . 
  * ** downvote ** = bajivoto , * bajivotear * is the infinitive . 
  * ** circlejerk ** = `` chaquetas mentales '' or `` c\u00edrculo chaquetero '' , in this case , `` chaquetear '' would be a slang for jerking . 
  * ** hype train ** = `` tren del mame '' or `` tren del meme '' ; `` meme '' is pretty obvious , `` mame '' would be for `` mamar '' which is `` to suck '' , so you can get the idea behind . 
  i 'm gon na steal/copy the clickbait , maybe something like * `` putoclick '' * would do it . 
  lo so , c ' \u00e9 qualchecosa nella sangue latina che ci face cos\u00ed . 
  none of you have ever heard of mexican lovers or cookers apparently . 
  horrible in what sense ? 
  food quality ? 
  i have n't had the chance to visit european countries for more than 2-3 days in hotel and fly back ( or forward to the next destination ) . 
  reading all your comments gave me ideas for a business , a mexican market could/would be a big success when properly planned and executed . 
  i shall consider this as my retire plan ... 
  what about an exclave overseas ? 
  taco bell in general .
