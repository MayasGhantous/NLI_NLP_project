  hence the downvotes . 
  nice to see how a valid impartial question here is `` controversial '' . 
  because censorship of posts questioning the official ideology is not censorship , supposedly .

  georgia and ukraine are independent countries , but chechnya is a russian federation subject . 
  too many `` british '' people like this , and you have to deal with this problem . 
  or better , with the meta-problem , no ? 
  yes , as long as they are not shared with anyone else and are preferably encrypted . 
  i think ukraine has months similar to this . 
  if we go beyond european languages that use the latin script , does vietnamese win ?

  the same . 
  my way is the mirror image of this one ( item-by-item , of course ) . 
  often english teachers in other countries think that the book or their colleagues know better than the native speakers . 
  it 's ridiculous , but it seems to be common in many countries . 
  the baltics too . 
  now london and guatemala city are a short train ride away from each other , nice . 
  `` birra '' is indeed weird , but some people say `` bironga '' , but very jokingly and informally ( and much less commonly than `` chela '' ) .

   ukraine 's participation in eurovision this year was highly provocative and politicized . 
  despite rumors that the song might be disqualified because of its political overtones , the eurovision song contest reference group cleared it for the competition , claiming that neither the title nor the lyrics contained political speech . 
  '' ... that neither the title nor the lyrics conflicted with the official political agenda . '', 
  the proof is right below :  it would have been disastrous if russia had won the contest , a eurovision source told the mirror earlier , revealing that `` feeling is that the european broadcasting union know how unpopular a russia win would be and will do everything possible to help the other favorites to victory .

   do these people walk around at all ? 
  like take a walk outside ? 
  they usually do n't . 
  the emptiness of streets in american cities ( with the exception of nyc and maybe boston ) is astonishing and disturbing . 
  [ land somewhere in the us ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@33.7575896,-84.3667054,3a,75y,247.07h,70.62t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srz_qb2guoq-o7kq4fdwr6q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) on google street view , and the streets will be usually empty . 
  many years ago i was in a mid-sized american city and decided to walk around to get familiar with the place . 
  after walking many blocks on the empty sidewalks , finally a living soul appears in the distance , walking on the same sidewalk towards me . 
  the soul walks closer to me and , when the distance between us was about 30 m. . . steps off the sidewalk , crossed the street and continues walking on the other side !, 
  i did n't know back then that people there were afraid by default , and thought that person did n't like me or something . 
  later my host said to me she was worried about me walking around because `` there are a lot of criminals everywhere '' . 
  i was puzzled : what am i supposed to do , live in constant voluntary imprisonment ? 
  why did i come here then ? 
  a famous russian designer and traveller artemy lebedev has an interesting travel blog with pictures from most countries in the world . 
  he noticed that phenomenon as well , in dallas :  earlier in america it was like everywhere - the riches lived in the center , the servants in the suburbs . 
  after the abolition of serfdom segregation , blacks were allowed to live anywhere , because the separation into blacks and whites had been erased . 
  well of course they began to settle in the center . 
  but to the whites , this situation was not pleasant - it is difficult to get used to that in one day . 
  therefore , whites en masse began buying suburban real estate , moving in in clusters . 
  actually , in the whole country , mixed-race areas are extremely rare , despite all the propaganda . 
   so , in the city centers there were only offices left . 
  therefore , the people on the streets in a typical american city can be seen at the beginning of the working day , at lunch time a little bit , and at the end of the working day . 
  and we must bear in mind that all go only by cars . 
   officially , the us is the third most populous country after china and india . 
  but when you look , it seems like everybody died . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://tema.ru/travel/usa-4/#dallas ) ), 
  are 1 and 5 kopeck coins even used anymore ? 
  i read that they stopped minting them a few years ago .

  the new one is rub . ), 
   vegans are n't humans !, 
  if they imagine animals on the same level as humans , they are n't that far from tacitly making this statement themselves .

  but that 's uncomfortable to the west . 
  therefore , no . 
   but after 6 i feel bad now . 
  i 've had 12 and i have to work in 8 hours . 
  the ability to speak is essential . 
  hard righties and hard lefties have a lot in common ( lack of common sense ) . 
  about # 1 and # 3 , definitely ; as for # 2 , i think drunk people are n't really great at forming sentences . 
  anyway , at least in my experience , the degree of drunkenness is usually about the same for the two ( otherwise it 's not really fun ) , so i think having sex when forming lousy sentences is normal . 
  that 's sick . 
  what kind of human would want so much to ruin one of the most beautiful things ? 
  i would probably get up , dress and do something else after signing . 
  like , moving out somewhere , maybe . 
  drunk sex is not ethical ? 
  [ `` irony of fate '' movie introduction ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9w0gcvpz4e ) ( 1976 ), 
  it 's not exactly the problem with the majority , it 's the fundamental impossibility to apply such an idea . 
  `` murder '' of animals does n't exist , this term is n't used in this meaning , but if it did , would people who accidentally stepped on bugs ( and killed them , of course ) be charged exactly as for involuntary manslaughter ? 
  it would just make your world one big prison then . 
  and people who fish or hunt would be charged for aggravated murder ? 
  let alone the fact that it would be practically impossible to investigate if i really killed that mosquito in my sleep . 
  so , however nice this idea looks from the far , it wo n't work realistically , and i think because it ignores the evidence - life forms are not equal , and many of them kill the lower ones to survive . 
  you would n't charge a cat with murder for killing ( and torturing , if you 've ever seen what cats do ) a mouse , but you would a person ? 
  that simply wo n't work . 
   ideally we would , imo herein lies the big problem . 
  this would either cause massive chaos , or , more probably , simply be impossible to implement . 
   it 's not a fact , it 's just how i feel that is , irrational - what was pretty obvious before . 
  and it is always concerning when people act on irrational ideas - this rarely leads to anything good . 
  but it 's not equal . 
  some life forms are more evolved than others . 
  a rabbit is not equal to a worm ; an amoeba is not equal to an elephant . 
  views and especially decisions based on a misunderstanding are dangerous . 
  for example , according to such views most people , including me , are criminals . 
  i do n't understand if this is fanaticism or some mental issue . 
  why do most of these violent `` animal lovers '' do n't even seem to know what an animal is ? 
  but i wo n't be surprised if some of them really believe that killing a cockroach or a mouse is the same as killing a person .
