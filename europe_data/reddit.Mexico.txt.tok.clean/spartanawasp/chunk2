  while i agree that they should n't have taken crimea by force , i personally believe that if an actual , fair vote had been exercised , crimea would have joined russia anyway, 
  well italy is often compared to a boot while we are compared to a heel so reverse italy might not be that far off .

  can confirm, 
  pretty sure poland/baltics ( previously west germany ) are europe 's first line of defense :p, 
  and the uk is only leaving the eu , not nato, 
  the name mexico comes from the country being named after the city itself , whoch comes from the word * mexica * , another name for the aztecs .

  i know you meant united nations security council , but in the halo series the armed forces of the humans are called [ united nations space command , or unsc :p ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/factions_of_halo#united_nations_space_command ) . 
  what does halo have to do with this though ? 
  1848 worst year of life,

  i believe we are either the first or the second * country with the most tlc/ftas in the world . 
  * that were in use, 
  boggles my mind how hypocritical the spanish are about gibraltar while having ceuta and melilla ... 
  does n't the us have a much lower median wage however ? 
  as opposed to the more comprehensible ` this will happen if we do n't ' ? 
  offer bigger regardless incentives, 
  and i 'm geniunely scared about trump :(, 
  too bad the first one was n't that good and the second one was hot garbage, 
  link 's dead :(, 
  is n't southern italy really underdeveloped or something ? 
  that 's what i 've heard, 
  no flair ?

  wikipedia says nyc metro has 20m and mexico city has 21m . 
  or dictatorships using `` democratic republic of '', 
  actually it 's united mexican states , or * estados unidos mexicanos *, 
  here in mexico we do consider america a single continent too . 
  however , we divide it into north and south as subcontinents and mexico is na . 
  [ central america is a part of north america though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_america ), 
  once again we get excluded out of north america :(, 
  well the eastern thracians are anyway ...
