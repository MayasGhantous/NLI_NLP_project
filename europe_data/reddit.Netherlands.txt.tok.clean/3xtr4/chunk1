yeah definitely , because a foreign minister talking like a kid in a school yard is definitely something you get burnt by . 
  indeed , it 's saddening to read how some people just read a random telegraph ( the telegraph ffs ) article and seem to accept anything it says without question , and bash on things without even watching the whole debate . 
  did he say that ? 
  are you trying ` to make things better ' by whining on reddit ? 
  please man , cut the bullshit . . 
  [ check the flag . 
  op does n't really understand what he 's saying . 
  the best vodka is stolichnaya . 
  you may be correct on that , but the autobahn is in germany . 
  in the netherlands it 's just called a highway . 
  for some reason , i do not doubt that . 
  well then get the fuck out of the eu i would say . 
  and lose all your benefits . 
  you do n't get to receive only the good parts and refuse the bad parts . 
  hey mate , you high ? 
  or just stupid ? 
  it 's funny how some people still ca n't seem to wrap their heads around this , and are saying how bad germany is for profiting of the backs of the greek people , while they have no idea what they 're talking about . 
  in the long run , germany will lose all that money . 
  no they fucking do n't . 
  only if greece were somehow able to pull money out of their ass to pay of their loans , which they wo n't be able to . 
  these loans will be turned into a gift eventually . 
  i 'm just sick of these racists making comments like that and then trying to justify it . 
  i 'm sorry for my outburst , but are you fucking stupid ? 
  do you ooze stupidity out of your pores ? 
  maybe you can think about the journey a bit , on a shitty boat accross the sea , or walking for weeks through eastern europe ? 
  maybe you can imagine how women and children would not be able to travel like that ? 
  that they are too weak , especially if the children are young ? 
  maybe you can think , with that little fucking pea in your head , how these women and children stay in refugee camps while their husbands try to get to a safe country , so they can start the reunification process ? 
  that same process that will give these women and children a plane ticket straight to the country of asylum where their husband has gone to ? 
  so without the perils of traveling for weeks ? 
  nah that is probably too hard for your fucking degenerate brain . 
  ok no worries mate , just wanted to clear that up because recently i 've heard a lot of people from eastern europe say they would be better of w/o europe because they pay more than they receive . 
  and that little retarded fuck is indeed a little retarded fuck . 
  now where does that 200 come from ? 
  edit : and even then , you still receive more than you contribute . 
  it does n't matter if it 's 1 % or 2 % . 
  so just own up to that , that it is bullshit that everything east of germany has a net contribution to the eu . 
  mate , you said you are net contributors to the eu . 
  i 'm not saying anything about a charity case , i 'm just telling you you are completely wrong about being net contributors . 
  you ( as in romania ) receive 4 % of your net gni and contribute about 1 % of that same gni . 
  and by the way 1 % is 1/100 , not 1/50 . 
   kek . 
  except the little fact we 're net contributors to the eu ( except for poland which has a very high absorbtion rate of eu funds ) . 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
   breakdown of romania 's finances with the eu in 2013 :  total eu spending in romania -- $ 5.561 billion  total eu spending as % of romanian gni -- 4.01 %  total romanian contribution to the eu budget -- $ 1.369 billion  romanian contribution to the eu budget as % of its gni -- 0.99 % here is the [ source ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/romania/index_en.htm ) , it 's the eu website . 
  so while i was making my point , i saw you did n't mention romania specifically , but the whole eastern europe . 
  so i looked up another source . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-spending-contributions-european-union ) . 
  every single country east of berlin contributes less than they receive . 
  except for lithuania . 
  get your facts straight . 
  there we go again . . 
  their kids ? 
  your kids ? 
  you argue that they will get 4 kids in 10 years each . 
  no problem right ? 
  that 's kind of dumb . 
  how would someone else get into your country as a refugee ? 
  not every refugee can afford a plane ticket directly to berlin . 
  that law seems kind of not 100 % thought out if the intention was to provide people asylum . 
  according to that logic people celebrating christmas and easter are all christian . 
  do you have a link of that for me ? 
  are you so ignorant you 've never seen political caricature ? 
  well then , go and fucking get hired then . 
  are you serious ? 
  i read it in the beginning of march , when they voted on it . 
  and what the fuck are you even talking about ? 
  the ep voted in april to protect net neutrality . 
  everyon was happy and thought they would be cool and finally the eu will do something sensible concerning the internet . 
  after which they started to draft the text which was adopted by the council of ministers past march . 
  this draft contained lots of very questionable lines which can in no way be explained as protecting net neutrality . 
  that is why it fucks up net neutrality . 
  i never said that this proposal specifically fucks up our privacy or everything basically . 
  there were loads of proposals like sopa , pipa who where intruding on privacy . 
  if you have some trouble with reading comprehension that 's not my problem . 
  so what the fuck are you on about ? 
  you clearly have no fucking idea what you talk about . 
  kindergarten could help you with reading comprehension , instead of screaming like a pussy that i do not understand what i 'm talking about when i link to the full text . 
  idiot . 
  yes , i read the proposal that was drafted in the beginning of march somewhere , why ? 
  edit : if you want to read up yourself here are the important excerpts : [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://edri.org/eu-council-proposals-protecting-open-internet-episode-1-phantom-neutrality/ ) , [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://edri.org/open_internet_clownwars/ ) , [ [ 3 ] ] ( http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2015/april/eu-net-neutrality-proposals-are-incoherent-and-misleading-say-campaigners/ ) . 
  and [ here ] ( https://edri.org/files/nn_roaming_final.pdf ) is the full one if you want . 
   hence the net neutrality rules . 
    i 'm under the impression that they have n't stopped throttling anything untill they have exhausted every option , like suing the fcc ( [ 1 ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/25/technology/tennessee-fcc-internet/ ) , [ 2 ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/24/technology/net-neutrality-telecom-lawsuit/ ) , [ 3 ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/04/technology/att-fcc-letter/ ) , [ 4 ] ( https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0cdaqfjac&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fmoney.cnn.com%2f2015%2f02%2f26%2ftechnology%2fcomcast-net-neutrality%2f&amp;ei=b-wsveefdc_lavfhgnal&amp;usg=afqjcnf1okbgrtxg0nlv0c3pmghnjfe0wg&amp;sig2=3slyobe0jfqx5k4k1am8oa&amp;bvm=bv.90790515,d.d2s&amp;cad=rja ) and i can keep going on ) and awaited the court verdict . 
  please go somewhere else with your misguided optimism , everyone in the world knows what kind of shithole you live in , where even the states sue smaller companies to protect big corporations . 
  nice net neutrality you have , with comcast throttling netflix . 
  jesus christ , not this shit again . 
  i 'm getting sick of all these proposals to fuck up our privacy/net neutrality/everyhing basically . 
  i really do n't understand why people downvote you . 
  do they seriously think any country 's leaders attach any value to the pope 's word ? 
  he 's just a symbol with no significance whatsoever in politics . 
  i do n't understand . 
  this guy embezzled almost 400000 dollars , and he deserves immunity ? 
  the guy should be locked up . 
  no , do n't do that !, 
  what a mess . 
  suggestions which never have been proved . 
  third hand evidence in a biography and a random neurosurgeon . 
  i think the last thing allies of putin would do is go along with lying about his assassination . 
  they would yell this of the rooftops .
