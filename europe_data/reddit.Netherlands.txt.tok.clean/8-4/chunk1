they require some more resources to have a similar pay-off , but it pays off faster . 
  i 'd say it 's more effective , and less efficient . 
  i do n't think it 's a bad long-term solution unless we have a hands-off approach and do n't push them to assimilate . 
  if aging population is a problem , then migrants who are willing and able to work actually are a good short-term solution . 
  i 'd say it 's less prevalent but more blatant when it happens . 
  i do think it 's worse here in the west where we 're not sure how to even aknowledge the problem without going full left or full right . 
  that 's true . 
  still , the black in china get less job offers than white who get less job offers than the actual chinese who get less job offers than pure han chinese who get less job offers than pure han chinese with a party background . 
  it 's simple and lovely, 
  never thought a channel called the hydraulic press channel would be so much fun, 
  a chinese schoolgirl once asked me if we white people were also racist against black people , or if that was just a chinese thing . 
  a bar in the nanjing business district . 
  that first one 's a different religious icon alltogether ( it 's nordic ) . 
  i do n't see a swatsika on the second one . 
  the third and fourth one are mostly standing on their flat end , and are indian rather than japanese . 
  but let 's accept the third and fourth ones as they are . 
  it does not matter . 
  why ? 
  because the japanese guy flat-out told me what his tattoo meant to him . 
  he did not say it was a buddhist symbol of peace and prosperity . 
  no , his tattoo was important to him because he had german friends and really liked germany . 
  if someone tells you they have the [ japanese imperial flag ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/dd/86/f1/dd86f1126b85ccbc03b0a8fbbea2ca05.jpg ) tattood on their arm ( which is [ seen as offensive by koreans and chinese ] ( http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20130425&amp;t=2&amp;i=725760022&amp;w=&amp;fh=545px&amp;fw=&amp;ll=&amp;pl=&amp;sq=&amp;r=cbre93o0m5x00 ) and used by the [ japanese right wing extremists ] ( https://i.imgur.com/yyifn7d.jpg ) ) , you can hardly come to his defence by claiming it is the [ flag of macedonia ] ( http://orig00.deviantart.net/ef26/f/2010/206/a/d/macedonia_waving_flag_by_mak110.jpg ) . 
  that would be silly , since the man just told you it was the japanese imperial flag . 
  he really likes japan , and he really likes the old japanese flag , that 's why has it tattood on his arm . 
  a more solid defence in favor of the person is by stating that the owner of the tattoo is simply not aware of the controversy of the symbol . 
  to him , this symbolizes a country which he likes . 
  nonetheless , it is always good to explore other explanations , especially if they are more favorable to the person we 're talking about . 
  anne frankly i did not see that . 
  you know that the [ buddhist one ] ( http://www.foreigners-in-china.com/images/buddhist-religious-symbols-swastika-on-statue.jpg ) is different from the [ nazi one ] ( http://www.foreigners-in-china.com/images/buddhist-religious-symbols-nazi.jpg ) right ? 
  the former 's clockwise , and laying on it 's flat end , while the latter is counter-clockwise and stands on it 's pointy bit . 
  besides , the japanese know what the nazi symbol looks like , as can be seen by these [ right wing activists ] ( http://40.media.tumblr.com/9f6b965606e6dc45ad7b8c6af35c31e5/tumblr_n4dfwsbuu01stj17bo1_1280.jpg ) carrying it side by side with the imperial flag . 
  yeah , but as i said earlier , there 's a difference between the buddhist swastika and the nazi hakenkreuz . 
  the buddhist swastika lays on the flat end , and turns clockwise . 
  the hakenkreuz points in the opposite direction and stands on the pointy end as can be seen [ here ] ( https://c4.staticflickr.com/5/4071/4525274963_b7d8ea6e7c_m.jpg ) . 
  that guy 's tattoo was counter-clockwise and on it 's pointy end . 
  he said he took the tattoo because he had lots of german friends . 
  it was the nazi symbol . 
  these are great !, 
  dark though . 
  it is also used by the right wing extremist nationaliists who wish to deny war crimes and censor history books . 
  it is also considered a sensitive issue by the koreans and chinese , so that the chinese government warned japanese tourists not to fly it at the beijing olympics . 
  the comparison still stands , if you ask me . 
  it says in the same article that it 's also used by right-wing groups and that the chinese and korean find it offensive and it 's use controversial . 
  so yeah , a symbol that 's considered offensive by those victimized and is used by [ right wing extremists who justify war crimes of wwii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uyoku_dantai ) . 
  at the same time , people who are unfamiliar with the controversy surrounding the symbol , tattoo it on their body . 
  to them , it is associated with a country and culture which they admire . 
  i think the comparison between the rising sun tattoo and the swatsika tattoo is still accurate . 
  nah , he thought germans were cool with it . 
  there are plenty of [ japanese imperial flag tattoos ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=japanese+imperial+flag&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1444&amp;bih=785&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiy7fr_zknmahwrjsakhr0zd2sq_auibigb&amp;dpr=0.9#tbm=isch&amp;tbs=rimg%3acxyzi-hjxwioijgp3j160vcpkammmyd9jgat4igvsfk3bn4z2bz6dusb09ypdonpybuh8oanocjm9swhkofbw8nbcsoscsncnxrrvw-rearxmg0qjpkvkhijqyybip0mbpmr8glzdgbye8mqegniizwwurce3hfz0j5b3rnwyyoscrnzvpp1swhtevpebn9-8itikhij1g92ic_1ifsero8sjesqsjpmqegnyga2gikz1lbhihc_19q6uxdyoscqeq58fbycfxecawtywcnsxg&amp;q=japanese%20imperial%20flag&amp;safe=off ) which is equally offensive . 
  besides , the good luck swatsika of buddhists and the nazi ones point the other way , with the nazi one standing on it 's pointy end and the other one on the long end [ like this ] ( https://c4.staticflickr.com/5/4071/4525274963_b7d8ea6e7c_m.jpg ) so the tattoo was not a good luck buddhist sign , but the racist one . 
  seeing as plenty of weeaboos tattoo the imperial flag on their arm or back because they think japan is cool , i think that japanese man just thought it was a cool symbol of germany . 
  if only we had some more princes to pick up the hot daughters of war criminals ... 
  do n't forget about [ king leopold 's whacky adventures in congo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congo_free_state#death_toll ), 
  i met a japanese guy with a swatsika tattoo once , he said it 's because he has many german friends . 
  the japanese have a very twisted perception of the germans . 
  ^ or ^ of ^ that ^ unfotunate ^ incident ^ in ^ nanjing edit : just to clarify , the tattoo was not the [ clockwise buddhist swatsika laying on the flat end ] ( http://www.foreigners-in-china.com/images/buddhist-religious-symbols-swastika-on-statue.jpg ) , but the [ nazi counterclockwise one standing on it 's pointy end ] ( http://www.foreigners-in-china.com/images/buddhist-religious-symbols-nazi.jpg ) . 
  [ side by side comparison ] ( https://c4.staticflickr.com/5/4071/4525274963_b7d8ea6e7c_m.jpg ), 
  the queen 's hot though . 
  so there 's that . 
  year 2023 : european union , members ( 1 ) : finland . 
  how about the dou ( b ) t ? 
  yeah , that stuff is for sale everywhere here . 
  is it actually a product in bulgaria ? 
  it 's always fun to find european products in china which do n't exist in europe . 
  reminds me of when some british guy did the same map-method using google , and poland 's result is `` why is poland so strong in civ v '', 
  they sound roughly the same ( \u00e9 and \u00e8 ) though , that 's why the second part ( \u6211 ) is the same . 
  true . 
  a lot of americans are proud that the chinese word for america ( mei-guo \u7f8e\u56fd ) means pretty country , because mei means pretty and guo means country . 
  however , it does n't refer to the country . 
  it refers to the continent ( mei-zhou \u7f8e\u6d32 ) , where zhou means continent . 
  so meiguo means america-country . 
  fun fact : ** mei ** - zhou , ** fei-zhou ** , and ** ya ** - zhou refer a ** meri ** ca , a ** fri ** ca and as ** ia ** , but they translate to pretty continent , wrong continent and inferiour continent respectively . 
  i find your comment a little creepy, 
  antwerp will be incorperated in glorious brabant . 
  it is for the good of all . 
  brabant could be unified once more, 
  if it works for pilots , why not for troops ? 
  that does n't even make sense . 
   we 're sorry , if you did n't have a sex toy before 04 february 2004 , you 're shit out of luck . 
  unless you 'll get your hands on someone else 's . 
  it 's a two edged blade however . 
  whoever you dislike , you 're probably not familiar with . 
  so your dislike of teenage moms or racists or jihadists becomes less self-evident . 
  in the end , you 'll hesitate disliking anyone , and it becomes more difficult to project your frustration at anything . 
  you 'll see the world as kurt vonnegut or ray bradbury do , as one with a lot of problems and no villains . 
  unlike most people around you , you 'll no longer get to project your frustration on a specific group or person . 
  you 'll have to face that no person acts bad knowingly , and cope with your annoyance and anger in a different way . 
  maybe it 's better to just not become too familiar with some distant specific niche , and just aim all your agression at radicalized wahabi leaders . 
  it 's not like you will meet any of those any time soon anyway . 
  by using it , do you mean you 'll try to familiarize yourself with others ? 
  if so , you should . 
  it 's a fun thing to do . 
  i think there is a maxim with xenophobe saltiness * familiarity x saltiness = constant if you get more familiar with a group , you 'll be less salty . 
  maximum saltiness is reserved for those who do n't go out of their way to get to know the other . 
  my current roommate is an arab , and getting to know hem really brought my saline levels to a dangerous low , which is also known as `` hey , they 're people just like us '', 
  unfortunately , those statistics come from double-barreled questions . 
  a dutch questionaire asked the following question : do you object to resistance groups such as ( ... ) ( here it noted a bunch of groups , but also is ) fighting against heavy-handed regimes such as assad 's ? 
  of course , only few would object to rebel groups fighting autocratic regimes . 
  however , the sneaky bastards interpreted every positive answer not as `` i do not object to rebels fighting autocrats '' , but instead decided that the correct interpretation was `` i support is '' instead . 
  it takes no genious to see that this twists statistics .
