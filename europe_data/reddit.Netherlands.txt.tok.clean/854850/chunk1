and that 's not happening anyway because of turkey . 
  which is what i do n't understand . 
  turkey and greece are both in the nato , so i do n't think one of them will ever be stupid enough to attack the other . 
  and if one of them does , the whole nato will attack them . 
  the real reason they wo n't cut on military expenses is because of germany and france vetoing it via the imf, 
  theeen my sources were really bad . 
  we pass the croatian-serbian border every year and they are slow as fuck . 
  one time there was a 3 kilometer row for the borders . 
  so that took around 3 hours . 
  the reason we did n't go through hungary was because we thought that would take even longer, 
  how strict are they now at the hungary-serbia customs ? 
  i thought i read or heard somewhere that they were pretty strict already, 
  thanks . 
  until last year is also waited with hearing the songs until the contest itself , wanted do it different this year . 
  i even checked if i typed zeljko correctly , fixed it now, 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll probably do one for the second semi and final too, 
  for me , i do n't mind hearing music from most genres , like punk , but i never deliberately listen to punk . 
  i just really do n't like this song . 
  the fact that they 're mentally disabled does n't change anything for me . 
  thanks !, 
  i did something wrong with formatting the links in a way reddit did n't recognize it , and in a hurry i edited it wrong , will change it now \\* it should work now, 
  oh yes i will add that to the post, 
  in greek ( modern and ancient ) , there is no ` c ' or a similar letter , only an s ( \u03c3 ) or k ( \u03ba ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure the same goes for cyrillic , where also no ` c ' exists ; the s is a * \u0441 * and the k a * \u043a * . 
  so changing one of them would be rather complicated for both countries , and would also not solve the problem and confusion . 
  the final is saturday , tonight is the first semi-final in just a couple of hours the first semi-final of eurovision will start in vienna . 
  in this ` summary ' , i have listed the songs in tonight 's performance order , and added my own thoughts on the songs , being neutral . 
  the links next to the songs wo n't spoil the performances of tonight ( no rehearsals and such ) , abut if available will go to a good-quality live performance ( mostly performances of national finals ) , but you do n't have to see them to understand me . 
  01 moldova : eduard romanyuta - i want your love [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz655avmyyo ) if you watch eurovision and see this as the first song , you will probably think ` what the fuck is this show ' , but do n't worry , this is one-of-a-kind . 
  with this song eurovision goes back 10 years in time . 
  it reminds me a lot of [ dirrty by christina aguilera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rg3sab8id8 ) . 
  but this song is different than all other entries , and maybe that 's why i like it . 
  i would be really surprised though if this will finish top 10 and get through the finals , many people dislike this one 02 armenia : genealogy - face the shadow [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvvvgd0-mu0 ) this is the first of many ballads you 'll hear this eurovision , and definitely not the best one . 
  it 's sung by a group of six singers made for eurovision , who come from 5 different continents , and armenia itself . 
  i 'm afraid however they wo n't sing really good live . 
  if you do n't know what this song is about ( and you have lived under a rock the past ~ ~ 100 ~ ~ 101 years ) , it 's about the armenian genocide , which happened in 1915 . 
  in my opinion , political things like the armenian genocide should n't be discussed on eurovision . 
  it also surprises me that this song is allowed to enter eurovision without any changes , while georgia had to change a song called ` we do n't wan na put in ' ( similar to vladimir putin ^ ( sidenote : this song was first called ` do n't deny ' , but they changed it voluntarily to prevent the connection with _ denying _ the genocide ) 03 belgium : lo\u00efc nottet - rythm inside [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9b3a7a7tbk ) after one of my least favorites , we go to one of my favorites . 
  this `` lorde-y '' song ^ ( no not lordi ) is pretty refreshing in eurovision . 
  the first couple of seconds will make you think you are listening to royals , but after that it just sound like a very good song you could easily hear on a hit station . 
  this will definitely go to the final . 
  04 netherlands : trijntje oosterhuis - walk along [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo1cqzpwrvi ) [ for those who do n't know to pronounce that name , here 's how she pronounces it herself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdapgec7fmm&amp;t=5s ) this year the netherlands has sent one of their more famous artists to eurovision , with a song that has n't any climax or something . 
  this song , written by 2013 participant anouk , could be best described as ` medium ' . 
  it 's not going to end very high , but i think ( and hope ) it will go the finals . 
  there was however a lot discussion about the dress she was about to wear ( looked like someone played on it with a scissor ) , and i hope she wo n't wear that tonight . 
  05 finland : pertti kurikan nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4t - aina mun pit\u00e4\u00e4 [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ephjs-3q068 ) i can assure you , there are n't any worse songs than this one this year . 
  this is the definition of awful . 
  the best thing about this punk song is that it 's the shortest song ever in eurovision : only 90 seconds long , so if you want to do a toilet pause you got to be quick . 
  note that this band was made before eurovision , so they did n't group them for eurovision alone . 
  however , they only reason that this song will get any points is because of the fact they are mentally disabled ( and maybe some bloc-voting ) . 
  but for me , this song is a 1/10 . 
  finland , if you want to win with something _ special _ , you have to make the song at least a bit good . 
  06 greece : maria elena kyriakou - one last breath [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xkmnncvdm ) every year , there are one , maybe two songs that try to repeat the success of the top songs the previous year . 
  greece is one of the examples this year . 
  the main reason this got to eurovision is because all the other participants on the national final sing good . 
  but she had a good voice . 
  a very good voice . 
  talking about voice , she won the voice of greece . 
  the first two minutes of this ballad are a tad boring , but then the song suddenly becomes pretty good . 
  but of all ballads , i think the only ones that can beat her are spain and albania . 
  it 's very likely that this will reach the final . 
  07 estonia : elina born & stig r\u00e4sta - goodbye to yesterday [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnxtxzm0qca ) speaking about repeating successes , this one is the other example . 
  the first thing that came into my mind was calm after the storm , as this also is a country-ish song , but this not a copy or something . 
  i like this song very much , it has hit potential and , more importantly , it has winning potential . 
  for me , the best song of this semi . 
  08 fyr maceodnia : daniel kajmakoski - autumn leaves [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8qct6cjchc ) a pretty good song , sung like it 's a fairytale . 
  however , i 'm very afraid that the live performance will ruin this song and thus result in this song not getting to the final 09 serbia : bojana stamenov - beauty never lies [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjrjvsoqwec ) if you would mix conchita wurst and susan boyle , you 'd hey serbia 's act this year . 
  her voice is astonishing , but there 's is one thing that will probably affect thist song negatively : she 's dressed `` very old-fashioned '' . 
  it really depends on the act for whether she will get to the finals or not 10 hungary : boggie - wars for nothing [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wetxc5z7cng ) can soneone wake me up ? 
  seriously , this song is perfect for letting someone fall asleep . 
  i feel bad for you australians who will have to see this at 4am or something , trying to stay awake . 
  very boring ballad about useless conflicts , which is n't a bad subject but a bit standard ( do n't get why they put ebola on the background though ) nothing special . 
  not the way a ballad should be imo . 
  11 belarus : uzari & maimuna - time [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvv_bmoqpwg ) the beginning of the song strongly reminds me of not alone ( armenia 's song last year ) , but at least this song is more upbeat than all other songs this semi . 
  but overall , this song is very medium , and is one of those song that you would easily forget about . 
  do n't really know what to think about this one 12 russia polina gagarina - a million voices [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbvy7glcd84 ) she looks like a crossing from kate ryan and ellie goulding . 
  ` hopeful ' ballad about humanity , but to me it comes over a bit hypocritical , escpecially with those kids in the clip . 
  this is a song you would hear when having breakfast in a hotel in another country . 
  sorry russia , but this is not my favorite . 
  but because it 's russia , this will be in the final 100 % sure . 
  13 denmark : anti social media - the way you are [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra-a_uve1ss ) like last year , denmark sends a ` poppy ' song . 
  it sounds similar to something , but i do n't know what his voice is n't the best of tonight , and i worry that he will miss some tones tonight . 
  not my favorite . 
  14 albania : elhaida dani - i 'm alive [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzjdwumxxzw ) wow . 
  just wow . 
  this song got me from the first to the last second . 
  just beautiful . 
  her voice , divine . 
  a cheerful upbeat ballad . 
  one of the best songs this year . 
  this must end in the top 5 in the final . 
  if we 're listening to voice alone in this semi , she and greece 's singer are the winners . 
  15 romania : voltaj - de la cap\u0103t [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw6skqbwqom ) what the fuck is this staging in their national final ^ ( ( disclaimer : i do n't know how romania 's performance of tonight will look \\ ) ) . 
  the singer looks like a tv chef , or that person you would see in those telemarketing commercials . 
  but then it changes to a rock song . 
  one of the few song that is not in english , and unfortunately it does n't do this song any good . 
  this will stick in the semis , sorry romania . 
  16 georgia : nina sublatti - warrior [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzrrqsi_pcq ) if you said to me that jessie j sung this song , i would believe it . 
  this ` upbeat ballad ' gives you this feeling of ' i can fight against it ' , which explains the title warrior .
