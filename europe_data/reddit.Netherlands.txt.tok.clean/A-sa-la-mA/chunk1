you have proved yourself dutch . 
  you will probably see more news about this around november/december . 
  the thing is the character [ ` zwarte piet ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwarte_piet ) , meaning black pete , is racist because it has roots of slavery . 
  the tradition had to change to make ` zwarte piet ' not black , because it is racist . 
  zwarte piet is part of sinterklaas , and is the jolly servant of him . 
  zwarte piet is really likeable , and for children ( as far as i know ) it does not matter which skincolor they are . 
  which i think is part of the dilemma . 
  some people say it is racist and has to change the skincolor . 
  i mean do the children care if they have a different skincolor ? 
  others say it is a tradition and we have to keep it black . 
  because the children do not care if zwarte piet is black . 
  even the un said we need to change this tradition . 
  a year ago we had to change zwarte piet into other colors . 
  like stroopwafel piet . 
  ( who is yellow , but * that is n't racist * ) iran also has a character that resembles black pete and most probably also stems from slavery , but no one bats an eye . 
  this is not really a problem in the netherlands . 
  but i hate how we need to change a dutch tradition , because the un says so . 
  ( sinterklaas ) but automatically take over another one , and it is no problem . 
   muh authority ... muh respect as leader ... muh nationalism erdogan 2016, 
   let 's not make that mistake again okay holland ... 
  just to clarify , the line :  the king of spain i have always honoured . 
  is more of an `` eventhough '' statement . 
  william of orange was the [ stadtholder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stadtholder ) and thus subject of phillip ii of spain . 
  ** eventhough ** william of orange always had respected the authority of phillip ii of spain , phillip did not have respect for the dutch people . 
  like prosecuting heathens ( angrying dutch protestants ) , replacing dutch nobles with spanish nobles in the dutch [ council of states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_state_ ( netherlands ) ( angerying dutch nobles ) , sending the [ duke of alva ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fernando_%c3%81lvarez_de_toledo,_3rd_duke_of_alba] ) ( angrying revolters ) , and higher taxes ( angrying the lower - and middleclass ) . 
  thus enough reasons to revolt ... 
   hard hehehe, 
  the united kingdom . 
  brexit was a decoy . 
  you forgot [ gerard joling ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/eurosong-contest/images/6/6a/gerard_joling.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151030124838 ) . 
  he is the biggest meme in the netherlands after our king . 
  esperanto ... it is your time to shine . 
  the small state of luxembourg is a charming reminder of how europe used to be ... plague victims crawl elegantly down its downfilled streets greasing the way with puss from their buboes . 
  while at least two children are burned as the devil in the handsome market square \u2122 . 
  oww wow this is some mandela effect , i have thought my whole life that was a pic with a goedendag , apparently it is a pic is with [ strijdvlegel ( flail ) ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/strijdvlegel ), 
  just you wait ... 
   we should start calling erdogan sultan recep . 
  no need . 
  he probably calls himself that already . 
  [ best photo ] ( http://main-designyoutrust.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/61.jpg?iv=805 ) boris , the man on the left , does not speak much , but if he spoke during this picture he would say : `` you know marriage is kinda like an eye for eye . 
  and let me tell you , mine did not end well . '', 
  very interesting , that could be a concept of alternate history , where caesar 's dynasty lives on in india . 
  * record scratch . 
  freeze frame . 
  * `` you see that guy right there ? 
  yea that 's me . 
  you are probably wondering how i got into this situation . 
  we will have to get a while back . '', 
  * you see erdogan at a lgbt rally in drag * `` wowwoooow not this far back ! '', 
   what 's next ? 
  ban dating ? 
  2 weeks later  erdogan participates in a tv dating show . 
  oops should not have replied to you but the user above you . 
  that he is so obsessed with politics that he goes to the extreme because he wants to succeed , to the point where he is just `` the right dutch populist '' instead of geert wilders . 
   geert does n't have much left in life besides politics . 
  his fortunes hinge on his political success . 
  this really . 
  even though i do not support him . 
  [ wait till you see baarle-nassau/hertog ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/baarle-nassau_-_baarle-hertog-en.svg/365px-baarle-nassau_-_baarle-hertog-en.svg.png ), 
  you . 
  i like you . 
  i feel like we could achieve a lot . 
  noordbrabant is a big technological center because of eindhoven . 
  and belgian brabant would be the cultural centre of the brabants . 
  dude we could be like the two new hollands !, 
  i do n't know how the flemish feel , but i expect not many dutch hating it . 
  especially the south of the netherlands sees the flemish more as brothers , because of cultural similarities . 
  the animosity and distrust you are probably referring to is the banter . 
  never !, 
  winged hussars look so badass !!, 
  the times i hear the netherlands is going to leave the eu , it is always outside the netherlands . 
  yea , but the japanese had [ dutch lessons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rangaku ) . 
  is n't that part of european influence ? 
  [ a bit relevant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dejima ), 
  looks llike you misspelled `` bulgarians '' . 
  bulgaria  austria  spain  all others,

  how a hollander pronounces 's gravenhage : 's ghhhhrrraaahrrvenhaaahrrgen how a brabander pronounces 's hertogenbosch : 's hertogenbos, 
  i love how the citymaps are really small but well detailed . 
  i can already imagine some tourist , from 1644 , using this map to travel through a city . 
  [ my favorite special little potato < 3 ] ( http://www.flowerweb.com/uploads/images/news/88808_flowerwebkingwillemalexander.jpg ), 
  it has nothing to do with misogyny , but the use of burqa . 
  assassin 's creed anyone ?

  land, 
  yes he is even better !, 
  that is probably the most japanese/asian question in this thread . 
  i like it . 
  that the dutch have german accents in movies when `` dutch `` are speaking english .
