a ) , it assumes that all women wearing veils are `` enslaved '' . 
  in reality , many women pro-actively choose to do so on their own initiative . 
  the notion that muslim women have to be `` liberated '' is one of the most fossilised and trite zombie talking points that , no matter how many times it is shot down , somehow keeps springing back to life . 
  thank you . 
  there are so many women that choose to wear a veil , how does this point keep turning up ... 
  it did n't happen . 
  some tv program called argos medialogica stated 2014 that the dutch government had some plan in 2012 to replace the euro with a ** new ** currency called ` florijn ' , but based that statements on their ` own private sources ' . 
  it was never confirmed . 
  kanariepietje states that we ` succeeded in preparing to return to our own currency ' . 
  not true . 
  we do n't have an ` own ' currency , we have the euro and have had the euro for over 15 years . 
  there is no possible way to return to our old currency ( which is the gulden btw , not the florijn ) - it 's just some dumb sentiment here of some people that feed on nostalgia . 
  sounds so humane . 
  yes it is . 
  this . 
  different things . 
  it was . 
  but the reason that uberpop got banned , was because it offered unlicensed drivers the opportunity to work as a taxi driver . 
  there 's a dialogue going on about modernising current taxi-laws , and uberpop was n't really healthy for the discussion . 
  personally , i think it 's dumb that you have to go through so much bureaucratic red tape here to become a licensed taxi driver , but let 's not forget that a lot of people rely on these services for their income - so let 's wait for the dialogue to progress and hopefully it 'll all get looser soon . 
   they `` dealt '' with it by making uber illegal over here . 
  i think we just made uberpop illegal , an uber service that allowed ` normal people ' to sign up their car for uber services . 
  the netherlands is not a dense country , it 's an empty city . 
  that 's not the only thing that makes me happy i live here and not in the us . 
  haha , it 's hard to be unbiased if you live here !, 
  yet , they are n't . 
  they 're literally situated in africa , not on europe . 
  the same argument arises every time : they have been under spanish control for most of their history . 
  same could be said about gibraltar . 
  if spain wants gibraltar back , they should give ceuta and melilla back to morocco . 
  yeah , please source this . 
  but amsterdam is a must-visit on a tour through europe . 
  if you ask me , the best city on the entire globe ^ , 
  why is your flair ` rotten ' ? 
  we do know some spanish right ? 
  have n't you listened to the ` youth of nowadays ' ? 
  he could n't pronounce ` koning ' ( king ) , he pronounced it as ` konijn ' ( bunny ) . 
  all hail king bunny !, 
  more like doing your wife two hours after she comes out of labor . 
  we are a hugely individualistic society . 
  we do n't really identify with collectives , it all comes down to personal choice . 
  even within my family , everyone votes for a different party . 
  they have a shitload of oil and sea that they do n't want to share . 
  so not gon na happen . 
  a little bit of context : as you all know , in the netherlands we can buy marijuana ( at coffeeshops ) and smoke it . 
  but we have this strange regulation where selling weed is allowed under circumstances , but cultivating it is not . 
  so currently coffeeshop owners have to ` magically ' purchase weed , and government officials ` look the other way ' and intentionally do n't ask questions about the origin of purchased marijuana . 
  what this does , is stimulate illegal cultivation ( and thus crime ) , while having no control on the quality of the marijuana or the ( chemical ) substances used to cultivate them . 
  this law means that marijuana can now be cultivated under government control , eliminating crime and weird ` backroom ' trade , while increasing quality and regulation . 
  a nuke , sure , but what about other weapons ? 
  i mean , they shot down a plane full of our citizens ( including three people i knew ) and no one is still really sure what happened ... 
  so first of all , hilarious video . 
  ` how do i get out of here . 
  how do i get out of here ?! ', 
  laughed my ass off . 
  second , of all , i have something to note . 
  we had multiple tv personalities debunk wilders ' and the pvv 's party plan ( arjen lubach here , rob wijnberg did a video before that went viral as well ) - but what is the point really ? 
  we all know his party plan is absolute madness , he probably knows as well . 
  but the fact that it does n't make sense is n't what 's important here . 
  the fact that the pvv has such huge support is n't because the party makes big sense to them in substance , they mainly vote for him because they do n't feel ` heard ' . 
  our answer should n't be to bash them constantly . 
  people that agree with these videos are people that already agreed beforehand that the pvv is shit . 
  nothing changes , they just get it confirmed again . 
  on the other side , the pvv voters get bashed again by our huge progressive left . 
  we won the cultural war , and we ca n't get off our high horse and constantly have to show that to the far-right ( who once were n't far-right , so something pushed them ) . 
  the answer should n't be to focus on what makes the pvv a bad party , the focus should be on what makes other parties good . 
  but i guess that has fewer media worth , so what do i know . 
  it was not the point i was trying to make , so why cite it ? 
  the point i was trying to make is that crime rates keep dropping ** overall ** - statistics change , for us favorably . 
  i was n't trying to discredit the fact that dutch citizens with moroccan descent have are more likely to be suspected of a crime , they are , but it 's still nothing compared to crime rates in , for example , the us . 
  i linked the report for everyone to read , if i was going to cite what you suggest , why not just go ahead and cite the whole article ... 
  note : article from 2014 . 
  [ here is the annual report on integration 2016 , it 's in english . 
  ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/publication/2016/47/annual-report-on-integration-2016 ) in the future , please try to provide information portraying actuality . 
  these things are important because  * over the past decade , however , the overall proportion of suspects among native dutch as well as people with turkish , moroccan , surinamese and antillean backgrounds has almost halved . 
  * stats change . 
  sad populist outcry because he is hemorrhaging in the polls . 
  i guess trump was useful for something at least . 
  stop spreading bs and source yourself, 
   during this period [ islamic golden age ] , the muslims showed a strong interest in assimilating the scientific knowledge of the civilizations that had been conquered . 
  many classic works of antiquity that might otherwise have been lost were translated from greek , persian , indian , chinese , egyptian , and phoenician civilizations into arabic and persian , and later in turn translated into turkish , hebrew , and latin . 
   with a new and easier writing system , and the introduction of paper , information was democratized to the extent that , for probably the first time in history , it became possible to make a living from simply writing and selling books . 
  [ 38 ] the use of paper spread from china into muslim regions in the eighth century , arriving in al-andalus on the iberian peninsula , present-day spain in the 10th century . 
  it was easier to manufacture than parchment , less likely to crack than papyrus , and could absorb ink , making it difficult to erase and ideal for keeping records . 
  islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in europe for centuries . 
  [ 39 ] it was from these countries that the rest of the world learned to make paper from linen . 
  [ 40 ]  ibn rushd and ibn sina played a major role in saving the works of aristotle , whose ideas came to dominate the non-religious thought of the christian and muslim worlds . 
  ibn sina and other philosophers such as al-kindi and al-farabi combined aristotelianism and neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through islam . 
  [ citation needed ] arabic philosophic literature was translated into latin and ladino , contributing to the development of modern european philosophy . 
  i can keep going if you want to ... 
  this is true . 
  this circle jerk , seriously ? 
  ` but meh , look at them , they did this and that so muh ! ', 
  not surprised you 're sporting a limburg flair . 
  true ... 
  to say ` we did n't have slaves because they were n't in our country ' makes no sense . 
  we were practically the biggest slave transporters in history . 
  believe us , it 's pretty racist . 
  i feel like we have n't had a real snow day in ages in amsterdam . 
  for now it 's pretty , in a few days we 're gon na have all that * bruine smurrie * .
