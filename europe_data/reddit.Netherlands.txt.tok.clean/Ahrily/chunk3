  specialty beers , which is a huge trend now ( especially in amsterdam ) , are really good . 
  your ignorance stands progression in the way . 
  stating that ~ ~ immigrants ~ ~ ** refugees ** are illiterate ( not all of them are ) , giving them jobs so that they have something to do ( why do you have a job ? 
  to do ` something ' ? 
  or do you contribute to society -- which is the intention of giving them jobs ? 
  ) , stating they all have 5 kids with reduced iqs through inbreeding ( wtf is wrong with you dude ) , require more unneeded ( very needed ) and unwanted ( probably by you , but what are you even worth in this discussion after all these ignorant comments ) . 
  let me explain it simply for you : 1 . 
  there are refugees now 2 . 
  we spend money on them for housing and nourishment 3 . 
  us spending money on them is an investment 4 . 
  we give them work , so that they contribute to society 5 . 
  money spent on them returns to economy through labor xoxo, 
  ** the challenge of finding jobs for refugees in germany ** months ago , nrw set up 47 specific `` integration point '' centers where refugees can find help with integration classes , guidance counseling , recognition of foreign credentials or finding a kindergarten spot . 
  trained staff who speak several languages , often including arabic and farsi , also help refugees find their way into the german labor market . 
  about one out of three refugees has no formal school diploma , the nrw employment agency told dw in an email , adding that young people with little or no schooling rarely have a chance of finding a trainee position . 
  seventy percent of the refugees in the state 's october unemployment statistics are male , and poorly educated - and the only kind of job they seek is untrained labor . 
  culture is n't the major integration barrier at all , according to a study by the research institute of the federal employment agency , which suggests that refugees who have fled to germany by and large share their host country 's values . 
  br\u00fccker is confident many refugees will find their way into the german workplace . 
  nationwide , the migration expert estimates that between 460,000 and 480,000 refugees wo n't be ready to enter the german job market until the end of 2017 and others even later . 
  it is very important for the member states of the eu to carefully think about what and what not to keep in stand with the uk , as we should not make an ` exit ' favorable and thus encourage other member states to drop out of the eu as well . 
  it should be clear through our decisions that the uk made a mistake . 
  can ours be too ? 
  this news article is bullshit anyway . 
  this is n't even reported about on almost all dutch news outlets , because it ** is n't a burqa ban , it 's a ban for covering your face in public places ** . 
  independent ( bullshit news site ) calls it a burqa ban , because yes - the 100-150 women in the netherlands that wear a burqa can no longer wear one because of this new law . 
  but so do the 50k + bike drivers that wear a forage cap . 
  why not call it a forage cap-ban ? 
  wow , talk for yourself . 
  yes , we stand for liberal values . 
  the liberty to dress yourself to your desires and to what you feel comfortable in . 
  we stand for liberal values , not ignorant bigots . 
  we have an extreme-right religious party called sgp that wants to have the death penalty back in nl . 
  that 's so hypocritical . 
  you condemn them for not sharing our democratic values , while disrespecting our democratic values by not letting people have their own opinion . 
  we are better than that . 
  we 'll just take some land from the sea, 
  people confuse democratic socialism ( se , nl , etc ) with socialism ( ussr ), 
  you should check out the erasmus program , 
  also - you swallow all liquids out, 
  you go down on someone , but like , * really * low, 
  yup, 
  you can recognize them from a mile distance . 
  usually very friendly though . 
  it kind feels fake , because we are a very direct people . 
  we have one on our museum square in amsterdam . 
  it 's highly guarded with thick black fences , and a us flag hanging high . 
  i think it 's an ugly sight for in a beautiful neighbourhood , because it seems so distrusting towards outsiders . 
  check eurolines, 
  plus , americans think we 're germans . 
  japan is a great country , but the thing that 's a real bummer , is that you 'll always be an outsider in their culture . 
  we call 'em wraps as well . 
  it would be soooo weird if we had that ... 
  yeah , literally everyone uses whatsapp here . 
  fun fact : there is a big genetic connection between the sami people of scandinavia and the rif berbers of northern morocco . 
  you should check the party plan . 
  they actually believe global warming is a hoax , made up by the left . 
  and we pinch !, 
  but maltese is right ? 
  oh , good to know , thanks !, 
  probably because it is a semitic language , being in the same category as arabic , hebrew and berber . 
  y u no like our language ^ ^ ^ ^ jk ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ sound ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ egyptian ^ ^ ^ ^ carpet ^ ^ ^ ^ sellers, 
  lol , typical dutch-outside-of-amsterdam-hating-on-amsterdam . 
  no , we are n't . 
  my initial comment was meant to ridicule america , like we mostly do . 
  stop spreading bullshit on reddit . 
  exactly . 
  if you would n't count europe as in mainland europe , but europe as in the tectonic plate it sits on , then morocco could qualify as europe . 
  but i think it 's more from a cultural point of view . 
  ... it does n't end outside of amsterdam ? 
  your language is so fascinating !, 
  it 's also the only european semitic language right ? 
  it means town in arabic , 
  and freedom ^ ^ ^ ^ ` murica !!, 
  definitely expected us to be very low . 
  have asked this question to friends multiple times , everyone said something similar to ` fuck , hell no ' . 
  we 're way too individualistic . 
  okay , so the netherlands is a really progressive , tolerant country . 
  our country 's history is based on tolerance towards minorities , women , homosexuals , etc. 
  most people have this mindset , although you 'll find most people in nl living in the randstad , a chain of the biggest urban areas in the west of nl . 
  this is a highly developed area , where most high-educated people live . 
  amsterdam is a city that has the most nationalities in the world , and you see this immediately if you visit . 
  a lot of cultures blend here , and it works well . 
  but it 's important to realize that the netherlands has a really high population density . 
  our population exceeded 17 million citizens last years ( vs. 10 million in sweden , which is a way , way bigger country ) . 
  there are villages and cities spread out in the entire country , and even outside of the randstad you 'll find a lot of people . 
  in some of these places , like the provinces of limburg , brabant , overijssel and zeeland , there are a lot of ethnic dutch people , but almost no people of migrant origins . 
  so the cities and villages are barely touched by multi-cultural influences . 
  support for the pvv in these provinces is really high . 
  mainly because these are more underdeveloped areas , unemployement is higher here because most jobs are found in the randstad , and the few contacts they have with immigrants are mostly on the news ( e.g. 
  the refugee crisis ) . 
  i get the point of view of your friend . 
  for me in amsterdam , and for everyone i know here , it 's really weird that wilders has so many support . 
  so i get that he refuses to acknowledge that he is somebody . 
  but he is . 
  polls show that he might get up to 30 ( of 150 ) seats in the parliament during the elections this coming march . 
  that 's 1/5th of all voters . 
  so yeah , he has real support . 
  is his party plan reasonable ? 
  no way . 
  but yeah , that 's just my point of view on his politics .
