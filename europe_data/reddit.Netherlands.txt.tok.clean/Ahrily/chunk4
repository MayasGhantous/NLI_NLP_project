  just your basic ` they took our jobszz ' plebs . 
   nothing in the english language makes sense . 
  yes , because using the word ` light bulb ' to describe a bulb that gives light makes no sense at all . 
  / s  the fact that ` anti-semitism ' is your call-to-arms makes me think you have ulterior motives . 
  funny you should mention that . 
  you being so offended by criticizing the term ` anti-semitism ' makes me think you have ulterior motives . 
   / r/europe is just salty as fuck sometimes . 
  proceeds to be * salty as fuck * himself . 
  right ? 
  i literally said ` fuck dit ' after reading two sentences . 
  * gets off high horse to be at equal level * relax dude . 
  you do n't understand my reply apparently . 
  first of all , in my earlier reply where i used the term , i pointed out that the person saw another term , but read it as anti-semitism . 
  * i copied what he said * , there is no other way of me copying what he said than to use his exact term . 
  that 's what quoting is . 
  if i wanted to use the term myself , i would call it ` hatred towards jews ' , because i 'm all about logical use of language . 
  i did n't ` give you shit ' for using the term . 
  i merely pointed out that i think it 's strange that the term is used . 
  the term originates from a time that jews were the only semitic people to be found in europe , so anti-semitism was hatred against jews . 
  now there are other semitic people in europe -- hence why ** it 's my opinion ** that it 's weird this term is still in use . 
  for example : if at one time the only contact with the people of north america was with native-americans , and hatred towards them was defined as anti-americism , it would also be weird if the term was still used this day . 
  oh , you mean when i said that : it was ** funny ** that [ quoting what was originally said ] is being read as [ quoting what was replied to what was originally said ] ? 
   * a quotation is the repetition of one expression as part of another one * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quotation, 
  most muslims are semites . 
  semites being anti-semetic ? 
  weird that people still ( mis ) use this term . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semitic ** edit ** : * throws red herring *, 
  so funny how so many israeli 's see anti-israeli sentiment and immediately read anti-semitism . 
  my response was more emotional than factual , because i 'm absolutely biased on the subject . 
  not trying to be objective on the matter , hence the ` fuck twat of a wilders ' . 
  but thanks for addressing on the points . 
  - vvd : how you describe their voters ( well-off ) , is what i meant with ` rich ' . 
  upper-middle class , mostly concerned with decrease of taxes and spending on social security , as that benefits them . 
  - purposely did n't include cu and sgp because of their small voter base in comparison ( latest polls put cu at 6 seats , sgp at 5 seats , versus 41 seats for vvd ) and their religious position . 
  people vote these parties mainly because of their religion , lesser for their stance on other topics . 
  - agree on that i did n't include d66 on the right because they 're highly progressive . 
  this spectrum i summarize is not entirely based on left-right , but hugely influenced between progressive-conservative . 
  again , thanks for including your reply . 
  i realize that it 's important for readers to have a more factual side on the matter . 
  yes , it does give votes to wilders . 
  there is an anti-eu sentiment here , but it 's mostly only expressed by wilders . 
  a lot of voters who are anti-eu do n't vote for him because of his extreme position on topics like immigration or islam in general , but will probably vote for him if they see that leaving the eu is actually beneficial for the uk . 
  we need co-operation . 
  we are a small country that is very rich because we had a successful history in trade and production , but those times are over . 
  in this day and age we ** can not ** compete with world powers like the us , china or india . 
  we need to stay united in the eu if we want to matter on this world . 
  we have elections in march , and his party is probably going to get the most votes . 
  multiple reasons why , mostly big anti-eu sentiment which is grounded in pathetic nostalgia , and fear for immigration ( and related issues ) . 
  another big reason is that the political left spectrum is hugely divided over a lot of small parties , while the right spectrum is mostly divided in three main parties : - ** pvv ** : wilders ' party - mostly uneducated , poor , ethnically dutch voters who live in neighborhoods that were built post-war , who 've just recently became more influenced by other cultures . 
  people that vote pvv mostly fear that their traditional neighborhoods will go to shit ` cus of the influx of other ethnic groups . 
  hugely populistic , not logical in any way . 
  their plans for government were so small that it consisted of one a4 ( one side of a paper ) . 
  mostly things like : no more mosques , no more muslims , 50 % off all vehicle taxes , no more money to fixing global warming ( because ` it is a lie of the left to steal more money ' ) , etc. 
  you get - get the dumb vote . 
  - ** vvd ** : party led by our pm , mark rutte . 
  mostly rich people vote for this party , as their main points are less taxes for the rich , more security , less immigration . 
  not as hard on this topic as the pvv though . 
  - ** cda ** : mostly conservative . 
  the netherlands remains a mostly leftist country , but the left is just so divided while the right is mostly united in a fewer parties . 
  this is why the pvv will gain a lot of votes . 
  dutch politics work in a way that after the elections , every party has a set amount of seats in parliament , from a total of 150 . 
  parties form a coalition that exceeds half of these seats ( 75 ) to gain a majority in parliament . 
  parties already expressed their concerns about the pvv and almost all parties already stated they will not make a coalition with the pvv . 
  happened before , did n't go well . 
  ** tl ; dr : big chance pvv is going to win big , small chance they 're gon na make it into government . 
  i 'm truly sorry to all you brits for saying this , but i sincerely hope brexit fails miserably . 
  ** really ** do n't want this fuck twat of a wilders gaining any more votes . 
  i still think it 's idiotic that countries are n't legalizing marijuana . 
  we get to buy it and smoke it , and it literally does nothing negative for the population . 
  and it pains me to see that the us , which is in my eyes a backwards , conservative third-world country , is making progression on this matter and european states are not . 
  get the meme bruh, 
  * checks if we are above finland * ^ yaaaaaaay, 
   they make my favourite cookies in the world - ~ ~ speculoos ~ ~ speculaas . 
  thank you ~ ~ belgium ~ ~ the netherlands !, 
  ftfy ~ ~ just kidding we love you baby brother ~ ~, 
  we 're talking about people in ** europe ** here , not the middle-east . 
  not if they marry a jew though . 
  who are you to judge that ? 
  being a muslim is a person 's own choice , you do n't get to decide . 
   which means leaving the religion in the future is a death penalty . 
  since when did the death penalty come back to our country ? 
  and since when did freedom of religion disappear ? 
  ceuta is on the strait of gibraltar . 
  no way spain is going to give that up . 
  it 's funny , because that gives the uk the best excuse . 
  i can not believe this is actually getting upvotes . 
  seems scientifically accurate, 
  it was . 
  most people did n't even know what it was about . 
  it 's almost cute how small it is . 
  that will change soon , though . 
  contractors were n't allowed to build high , because of the close proximity of the zuidas to schiphol airport . 
  buildings higher than 114 meters tall would interfere with flight control . 
  thanks to a new military-grade radar , the law has been scrapped . 
  they 've already started building some impressive skyscrapers . 
  there have n't been any significant gay-bashing incidents here in recent years . 
   gangs of moroccan youths say no more please , do say more . 
  if you 're going to make such accusations , source yourself . 
   pim saw it all coming !, 
  yet , he got killed by an extreme left-wing , ethnic dutch guy .
