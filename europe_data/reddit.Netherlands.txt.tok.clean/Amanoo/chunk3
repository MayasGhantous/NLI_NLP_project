  or how about videla ? 
  you did n't want to be aligned with the political left under him ( or even criticise the government ) . 
  political criticism is n't a good idea in today 's china . 
  and those are just a few out of many examples . 
  it has happened in every continent at some point . 
  perhaps every country . 
  when will humanity learn from the past , and stop trying to turn civilisation into a v for vendetta type society ? 
  because it will inevitably go wrong , just as it always has . 
  is n't this kind of an open door ? 
  a really big one that 's really wide open ? 
  it seems to me that / r/europe is somewhat pro-putin . 
  criticism of the guy is often not accepted . 
  i 'm not entirely sure how they 're viewed exactly in the netherlands . 
  i believe frans bauer ( a famous singer ) has a roma background , so at least that 's positive . 
  my mother has a mistrust of the roma , as they have a tendency to steal according to her , but i 'm not sure if that 's just her attitude , or if it 's more common in the country . 
  it 's possible that she adopted her opinion from hungarians ( we have some hungarian contacts ) . 
  i heard that in hungary , they 're often viewed as thieves and that the general attitude towards the roma there is very negative . 
  well , they 're not a nordic country . 
  they could perform better when it comes to various social policies . 
  the nordic countries know how to do those . 
  they should n't be an example just for ireland , but for every country . 
  i 'm growing more and more suspicious that putin is really a closet gay as the days go on . 
  no one is that much anti-gay , unless they 're really struggling with their own sexuality , and trying to hide it . 
  putin should learn that there 's nothing wrong with being a bit different from the average . 
  everyone is , in one way or another . 
  one might be gay , another might be a bit silly ( which is n't necessarily a bad thing ) , or whatever . 
  there 's no such thing as an average person , so you should just embrace who you are , because there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  if you do n't , you just become a stiff stuck-up person who hates his own kind . 
  and that 's definitely not good . 
  so please , dear putin . 
  accept yourself for who you are . 
  it 's not like the world will end . 
  you might even find it liberating . 
  we just figured out that if we lowered our standards , we could still have a lot of mountains . 
  when your country is as flat as a pancake , every pebble seems to be a hill , and everything bigger is a mountain . 
  ^ ( berg actually means mountain , and not hill , but some things we call mountain really are just small hills . ), 
  well , the uk is practically a colony of the us , these days . 
  it was only to be expected that the uk would import parts of american culture . 
   i doubt de vries or de jong are jewish . 
  they probably were popular with jewish people that wanted to change their name to mix with the local population . 
  that 's pretty much why they 're considered jewish . 
  they 're not hebrew in origin , but were popular among jewish people , and therefore are now considered jewish names . 
  a lot of german and polish names are considered jewish for the same reason . 
  also , you mean naaktgeboren . 
  i 've heard the same story about people picking funny names because they assumed napoleon would leave soon . 
  as far as i know , it 's actually true , though i have only heard other people tell me the same story , so i ca n't say for sure . 
  i ca n't find very good sources for given names ( most deal with the most popular baby names , rather than most common names ) , but here are some surnames . 
  i consider jansen and janssen to be the same name , so i copied 11 surnames , and i added some translations/explanations . 
  ** top 11 dutch surnames : ** 1 de jong ( `` the young '' ) 2 jansen ( `` son of jan '' ) 3 de vries ( `` from frisia '' ) 4 van de berg / van den berg / van der berg ( `` from the hill/mountain '' , the people who came up with these names either lived on a hill or in a town that had the word `` berg '' in its name ) 5 van dijk ( `` from levee/dike '' , these people apparently lived on or near a levee ) 6 bakker ( `` baker '' ) 7 janssen ( `` son of jan '' ) 8 visser ( `` fisherman '' ) 9 smit ( `` smith '' ) 10 meijer / meyer ( `` bailiff/steward '' , i think this name is related to the word mayor , though mayor is not the name 's meaning , according to wikipedia ) 11 de boer ( `` the farmer '' ) ** additional interesting bits ** a lot of these surnames refer to some sort of region or topographical feature , to a given name ( * 's son ) or to some sort of job or position . 
  less common dutch surnames may even refer to very specific cities and towns ( castricum is both a town and a surname , for example ) . 
  this happens quite a bit in dutch surnames . 
  other dutch surnames may refer to animals , and there 's an occasional descriptive surname , such as de witte ( the white ) . 
  there might be other surnames as well , but those others are far less common . 
  a number of names are of jewish origins . 
  these include meijer , de jong and de vries . 
  for some reason , these names are particularly common among jewish families . 
  a lot of dutch sounding names are considered jewish names , and it 's virtually impossible to tell jewish and non-jewish surnames apart . 
  other examples of dutch jewish names include frank , de leeuw , van gelder , van dam , de groot , de lange , and quite a few others . 
  a dutch person would instantly recognise these names as dutch , but they 're considered jewish names as . 
  putin might have noticed that he 's not very popular in europe right now . 
  although considering the size of his ego , it 's very possible he has yet to notice . 
  dutch translation : als je twents kan praten , moet je het om mij niet laten english : if you can speak tweants , you should n't refrain for my sake . 
  i must add that there are many variants of twents . 
  almeloos and enschedees twents are definitely different . 
  germany , stop importing from the us so much . 
  you 're going to give europe a bad name . 
  that 's actually kind of funny . 
  is it ? 
  the current system is n't unaffordable , but it is inefficient . 
  the way i see it , a system based on basic income should n't mean that people suddenly start earning more . 
  if it 's implemented correctly , people should get the same amount of money as they got before . 
  there 's just as much money going around . 
  the way it 's distributed is just more efficient and therefore less costly . 
  it 's not like people who are unemployed but capable of work do n't get any money under the current system . 
  they receive welfare , but are expected to look for jobs . 
  other people might be considered ( partially ) incapable of work , and receive money ( possibly with some strings attached as well . 
  my roommate , for example , receives money under the wajong legislation . 
  the idea is that they 'll still receive money under basic income . 
  regulations such as the wajong will most likely cease to exist . 
  people who earn normal wages will still earn the same wages , but part of it will come from basic income . 
  in essence , the amount of money each person receives will remain largely the same , but you wo n't have a million different institutions for every problem . 
  the regulations and institutions should become less costly , as a result . 
   then they 'd kick back far far more . 
  that 's an assumption . 
  there is a possibility that they would n't really kick back a lot . 
  perhaps they would n't kick back at all . 
  but you 're completely correct in that the incentives are likely to be completely different in this experiment , and that it 's flawed . 
  it 's a temporary bonus . 
  much like yourself , i doubt it 's going to have such reliable results . 
  good point . 
  people will probably have more bargaining power , so employers ca n't get away with everything they can get away with now . 
  i had n't considered that . 
  still , i 'm not sure if wages wo n't get a bit lower . 
  people may be better off when you add the basic income and the wages up , but i 'm not sure about wages staying the same or even going up . 
  then again , it 's not impossible at all . 
  i 'm a bit doubtful . 
  a full experiment seems difficult to do . 
  if these people get a job , they 'll get both the full wage and the basic income , wo n't they ? 
  is n't the idea of basic income that it 's a simplification ? 
  lower wages with 1k , remove most forms of welfare and instead give people 1k , so that their net earnings are about the same as they were before , but with less bureaucracy ?
