  basically i 've skirted around the conventional definition of expat my whole time here , but mostly still get labeled as one as a white-american . 
  maybe it is , this is just what finn always have said to me - when they state how unique and distinct their language , to which i 've always retorted about hungarian/estonian . 
  some have said of course that estonian is * more * similar ( than hungarian ) , but none seemed to ever indicate any exceptional affinity or mutual intelligibility between the two languages . 
  it 's a two way street because of what i described below ( basically western european and anglophones all have some working knowledge of english rather than dutch when they arrive so that 's what they revert to as their lingua franca ) . 
  mena and other non-western immigrants on the other often do n't even know english at all , so it makes more sense for them to learn dutch than english from scratch . 
  that 's why it 's common to find many older mena-originating residents that speak fluent dutch but hardly a hello in english even in amsterdam . 
  but basically dutch people see non-western residents and just expect them to know dutch . 
  whereas if a vanilla-face like me comes up with my * buitenlandse * accent then i have to sit there and stubbornly refuse to respond to them in english before they 'll get the picture ( edit : and even then it often stays at linguistic standoff/pissing contest in which i keep speaking dutch unyielding and they keep speaking in english unyielding ), 
  correct though many individual states do . 
  i know for example that spanish and english share co-official status in new mexico . 
  louisiana ( more in rhetoric than practice ) designates ( cajun ) french alongside english as the official language of the state , i believe . 
  edit : english is n't official at federal level but it is indeed per your own words the * native tongue * of the us . 
  american here , my spanish is ace so i do n't care !, 
  edit : as a dutch resident i 'll chime in `` expats '' ( see also western immigrants ) , typically anglophone or western european who essentially come to amsterdam and speak english their entire tenure here . 
  people that give people like me ( who have taken the time and effort to learn some dutch ) a bad rep. 
  no way they 're closer than german dutch . 
  i 've asked finns and they 're pretty adamant that * both * estonian and hungarian are at best distant uralic relatives . 
  edit : highly doubt there was dialect continuum extant between the two countries ... at least in semi-recent history , like between nl and de, 
  no they 're definitely far more distant than spanish or italian are to one another . 
  language wise they 're vaguely related as far as i know . 
  edit : what about academic exchange between estonia and it 's other fellow baltic countries ? 
  it 's in france ? 
  apolgies , my guiri ass had it mixed up for a neighborhood in barcelona - there 's a neighborhood or at least a damn metro stop called jaume . . i digress in that case you 're absolutely right . 
  better question , is there these `` catalan '' gypsies in catalunya , espaya ? 
  at least in any noticeable numbers ? 
  ok i ask because the `` other spaniards '' seemed to think gitanos their own regions of spain were quite well integrated ( especially in andalusia where they 've contributed extensively to the local culture ) , so i 'm curious to hear what differences you see language aside ? 
  especially since they 're ethnically homogeneous ... 
  prepare yourself , you just opened a big ole canna worms . 
  just this one time i 'll throw a proverbial smoke grenade and lure him away : ( pulls pin ) * visca espanya !, 
  * ( scurries away in the smoke cover ) . 
  edit : are these catalan gypsies you speak of ethnically roma still ( as\u00ed que llegaron hace siglos y siglos ? 
  ) , or just lower-class catalans that decided to be semi-nomadic ? 
  he explained his reasoning above , and for those reasons it would be stupid not to do so , it only opens more potential doors for the future . 
  your beef should n't be him applying for or getting the passport , it should be if/when he arrives in italy ( or other eu country ) and does n't integrate/learn the langage * however * if he does indeed do those things ( entirely in the realm of possibility mind you ) then there is n't much to bitch about . 
  and if he does n't go to the eu at all , then it 's still no skin off your back because stated he ca n't even take advantage of welfare/social programs so he 's not some financial burden on the state . 
  finally be mad about the arbitrary and trivial immigration policies put on place by these governments instead , that 's ultimately what allowed him to get this passport in the first place , that 's what should change . 
  i mean i 'm sure as hell frustrated , as an american with not a drop of italian blood , but speaks fluent fucking italian ( and feels a strong affinity for the society/culture , lived there for a few years and most of my immediate family currently resides there ) , it 's unfair for all practical purposes i 'm more italian than the op , but that does n't make me anymore eligible for italian citizenship unfortunately , but again that 's something which is the fault of poor immigration policy on italy 's behalf not something i fault the op for at all , would do the same in his shoes ( in case i have n't made it obvious , i 'd be over the moon to have dual us-italian citizenship ) !, 
  wellll ... thanks to the dutch g it basically sounds like the word `` gloss '' but with the g making a sorta `` kh '' gutteral throat cancer noise we all love to attribute to dutch . 
  zee would rhyme with way . 
  edit : that 's why zee and glas are very intelligible written but much less so spoken aloud . 
  bij and by are pronounced the same ( mostly , and any difference is lost an english speaker 's ears ) and are used roughly 95 % the same in either language ( their may be some subtle nuances of when it 's appropriate to use in either language ) . 
  edit : it 's the way glas and zee are pronounced that would throw an english speaker off if anything ... 
  that was what i thought to write , but then i reverted back to my english/latin-language thinking mind ha ? 
  even though we say `` of '' in english with out `` van '' it would be more comprehensible to an english speaker without writing `` van '' anyway , because `` van '' and `` of '' do n't look too similar haha !, 
  edit : should read more closely , that is indeed what you said whoops !, 
  the man drinks a glass of seawater by the sea . 
  ( probably bad grammar or het vs de usage but whatever ), 
  well of course contemporary american ones would be : - speak english !, 
  - grab ( isis or other object of hate ) by the pussy !, 
  i 'm personally partial to mexico 's : * viva m\u00e9xico cabrones !, 
  hahaha , mother of god , not sure if serious . 
  on some real shit , do n't expect many positive or serious responses . 
  long story short , that 's a very ** fucking stupid ** idea , '' * stateless * '' in the eyes of the eu ( or more importantly the individual member states who would process affairs concerning asylum/migration ) is a an issue more for people coming from places such as palestine , who definitively lack documentation , a place to call home or even a government to call theirs . 
  a first-world westerner who purposefully renounced his citizenship , on the other hand , would almost assuredly not be taken in on humanitarian grounds . 
  instead rather sent right back to their country of origin , trump 's america - where you having renounced your us citizenship ( and once renounced , there 's ** no ** re-obtaining it ) would of course have no rights , and very likely sit in limbo in a fucked detention center indefinitely !, 
  source : i 'm from the us and have thought about all these crazy scenarios far too many times !, 
  i saw it and was like not hochdeutsche , not bayerisch , looks more like nederlands than standard german , must be plattdeutsche, 
  it was lit fam , there was hella thots there, 
  in amsterdam there 's not much of this however one of the weird niche `` black/grey '' market jobs that 's emerged is south asians taking polaroid pics of groups in bars , this is a regular occurrence and most bars in the city on busy nights , i assume this must be somewhat tolerated because of how prevalent it is . 
  sometimes the south asians sell roses here but i 've only seen that once or twice , although i have noticed it a common job for south asians throughout southern europe as well . 
  a lot of fellas in de wallen ( rld ) often * ( not exclusively or always ) surinamese , antillean and moroccan guys peddle baking powder as coke to unsuspecting and absolutely inebriated brits ( exclusively and always ) '' on stag-do in the red light . 
  sometimes people of no particular nationality sell beer around the vondelpark on hot summer days . 
  that 's amsterdam , and for it 's size and raucous rep , it does n't actually have too much of that culture . 
  by far the largest informal economy aka city with the biggest assortment and tolerance of tricks , trades and hustles done on the street in the name of dodging the ole taxman is ... drum roll si us plau !, 
  everything from squeaky voicebox toys , to tapamantas ( sp ? , they 're the sub-saharans with the purses on blankets with strings on the corners to be yanked up at a moments notice should law enforcement take an interest ) , sewer beers , trap houses where you can score all classes of party drugs , to the `` hey disco party '' , to the promoters for the more shoddy cannabis clubs aimed at tourists , various sarangs and blankets sold on the beach , thai massage ladies , to the guys selling sandwiches in samosas late at night when everyone has drunk munchies , literally the hustlers of barcelona leave no stone unturned . 
  most of these jobs were typical of the local south asian community largely of pakistani origin except for the massage ladies and cannabis club promoters ( oh and the disco promoters ) , i find them to be relatively harmless and often helpful only beef was with the aggressive sub-saharan `` prostitutes '' who would aggressively target drunk men and hound them rubbing up and grinding on them thinking their pickpocket method is slick , they were the most dangerous group in the city imo , once had one try to brazenly snatch my phone out of my hand after i told a group of them off and that i was n't falling for their poorly guised trip . 
  please elaborate how wolves * are `` bad '' , i 'll hang up and listen ... 
  yeah but ( and correct me if i 'm wrong ) i feel like based on what you just described you have to have some dutch blood to count as indo , and most current indos were born in the netherlands ( full blooded indonesians who were born in indonesia is another story ) . 
  anyway i feel like half the `` white '' dutch people i 've spoken to claim to have indo blood . 
  it 's kinda like mexican ancestry in the us , a lot of people have it mixed in , i for example am a quarter mexican so i find it a similar parallel and my point is that no one would ever consider me or people of similar ethnic roots to me , an `` immigrant '' or even `` immigrant group '' . 
  but maybe it 's because you guys have the whole * allechtoon * vs * autotoon * thing and that autotoon and indo are seen as mutually exclusive ? 
  tl ; dr - i do n't think indos can really be seen as an immigrant group . 
  ask a frenchman what he thinks of belgian or swiss french and he 'll concede that they 're mostly the same , mention * qu\u00e9becois * to a frenchman and he 'll wrinkle his nose in disgust and recoil as if having caught a whiff of the world 's most putrid fart . . edit : curious to hear their opinion of french from the francophone former colonies ( caribbean and africa ) edit : * tabernac !, 
  eu family visa , as in blood relatives or a partnership ? 
  basically my trajectory but the partnership visa was n't exactly a cakewalk . . 
  where are you from and which visas were you eligible for out of curiosity ? 
  i ask because as an american i did n't exactly find it easy aside from my initial study visa in the netherlands . 
  though of course i 'm aware ( from what i 'm told ) that the uk and even more so the us are quite restrictive in their immigration processes . 
  hmmm not european , but propagated from european imperialism , so will chime in either way : westward expansion/manifest destiny , revolutionary war ( breaking away from british imperial ties ) , showing up late to the colonial party and deciding to fuck with spain for shits and giggles ( puerto rico and the philippines ) , and then there 's everything with mexico ( which is somewhat tied to spain ) !, 
  edit : some dutchies downplayed the emphasis on their colonial legacy in north america , most specifically the former `` new amsterdam '' ( manhattan ) , however as an american in my experience they ** love ** to bring up said legacy when talking with us yanks as if its catapults them into some relevance , and some retroactive regret that they ever gave that massive slab of granite up !, 
  i also lived and worked there for six months , and feel the same way ... one day i 'll find a way to move back there !, 
  everybody is mixed somewhere down the line !, 
  in barcelona estrella dam and san miguel are often drank and in madrid it seemed like lots of alhambra and mahou . 
  spain ( barcelona ) or italy ( somewhere in the north , reasonably close to the dolomites ) , hands down , i like the people and food and speak both languages fluently . 
  if i could get a good job in one of those areas perhaps i 'd consider leaving amsterdam . 
  if you live anywhere with in convenient reach of amsterdam ( so basically the whole country ) , there 's a language-exchange that 's held weekly between spanish and dutch speakers , it 's free you just need to purchase a drink as it 's usually hosted at a bar ( one on rozengracht ) , if you search intercambio cafe amsterdam on facebook you should find their page !, 
  suces man !, 
  i see , but seems most others agree that it is first and foremost associated with and a symbol of the european union . 
  nonetheless interesting to know either way !, 
  not that i have to validate anything for you , but i actually have studied european linguistics at post-grad level ( hence why i 'm multilingual ) i 'm done going on with this `` dick measuring contest '' because that 's all this has regressed to at this point , so , that 's just what we 'll have to chalk it up to and agree to disagree !, 
  it 's a gradual thing and sure new ones can indeed emerge and evolve , but my own gf is a perfect example she comes from central florida and has a very neutral accent her mother from the same spot has the thickest southern drawl . 
  my mother is born and raised in nyc and bears no accent at all , her parents thick nyc accents , grew up in the same place . 
  it is a generational thing . 
  also you basically admitted that i 've lived in more parts of the country than you ( and places outside as.well ) so i have a broader spectrum to base my observations off of , so may be you should keep your own provincial assumptions to yourself . 
  thanks !, 
  is that national or just amsterdam ? 
  ok again a poster assuming they know my story without actually knowing me , got ta love how rich that is . 
  by the way where exactly are you from ? 
  i sure as hell hope it 's america with that arrogant lip your showing !, 
  lastly know i have a healthy mix , i 've lived everywhere from deep rural louisiana and kansas all the way to urban brooklyn to suburban seattle , to mid-sized cities in the south , midwest , and east coast but thanks for playing better luck next time !,
