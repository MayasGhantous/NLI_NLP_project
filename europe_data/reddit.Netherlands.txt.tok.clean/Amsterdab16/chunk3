  edit : also having lived in the nyc boroughs , suburban new england and the deep south , i 've lived in most regions known for stronger/distinct regional accents ( save for the great lake states ) , so again i think i do have considerable first hand personal experience !, 
  you 're right most of the major brands are indeed represented , however proportionally to one another it may as well be what you described - the ratio of ah to competitors in city is at least 10:1, 
  well my friend take the situation you described and multiply it by about 50 and that describes how it is amsterdam , flikker op naar een andere stad ah , kut !, 
  hmm this is more the inverse i suppose but being in europe , europeans often tend to be semi-shocked that i 'm not a trump-voting , gun-toting , morbidly-obese , who thinks murica is the best goddamned place in the world , and as mentioned in another thread on here , my polyglot abilities almost have some of them almost even refusing to believe i 'm actually american ( this has occurred on multiple occasions ) . 
  hmm amsterdam is the most clich\u00e9 one , i would with barcelona recent burgeoning cannabis when i lived there , some people expected the same level of `` tolerance '' as in amsterdam and the netherlands which in most aspects is not the case ( it 's less tolerated for shops to sell in spain than in nl , but it 's more tolerated for the them to cultivate and supply said shop wholesale in spain than in the netherlands ) , anyway i digress one of the biggest differences is policing of public consumption , which they do care about in bcn !, 
  in italy paper towels are called scotex after the popular brand , much like kleenex for tissue in the us, 
  not quite the same , but with the monopoly that albert heijn seems to have over the amsterdam supermarket sector , albert heijn might as well be the real deal supermarket sponsor/brand of amsterdam . 
  also one british expat was so fed-up with the brand that he created this little diddy [ ah song ] ( https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2yno1z ) , apparently got a lot of angry backlash from the dutchies over this , which i do n't get it 's an alright chain , but has no business having such a monopoly in its market share over the country 's largest metropolis - we want more jumbos and vomars * godverdomme !, 
  that 's mostly what i figured and took it as , but thanks for elaborating . 
  i guess maybe i 'm just embarrassed about our mono-linguistic emphasis ( or apathy ) and do wish that americans ( and anglophones in general ) took more efforts to be at least bi - if not multilingual, 
  thank you kindly . 
  i often do n't know whether to feel proud or offended about `` for an american '' but indeed i do hear that one quite often . 
  hahaha oh boy might wan na nix that part about dutch for for they rain down on you with the fury . 
  though ( and i now i have my own bricks to duck ) i feel that applies even more to the similarities between catalan and spanish . 
  edit : do you think swiss german is just as far from hochdeutsche as dutch then ? 
  italian , spanish , dutch and catalan edit : also german , although both german and catalan are admittedly beyond , rusty from not living in those places anymore ( dutch has also sucked up all my germanic language headspace at this time ) now you , what are yours english , german , french and italian ? 
  well you wording and articulation when saying it was `` neither of our language '' was not properly conveyed , so maybe that 's your english showing its fourth place status in your linguistic arsenal . 
  nonetheless , i measure anecdotally by most admitting on this thread that despite british english being taught in school , most seemed to indicate they erred more on the us side of things . 
  also the prominence of us terminology over british , ( atm vs. cash point for example ) , and also hearing reactions from europeans irl that mostly mirror the responses on this thread concerning the increasing prominence of us english . 
  despite whatever preconceived notions you i 'm not some typical ignorant , asshole , exceptionalist american , there 's a reason i 've lived in europe for quite sometime ... oh english is the first language i learned but the first of five so ... 
  no english is the language of english speakers . 
  in particular native english speakers i 'm not sure if you 're british or not but it is absolutely no more your language than mine , and that was again a beyond fucking ignorant statement on your part . 
  also considering us version * is * ( really is already ) increasingly becoming the standard of international english then that serves as a much better argument than any of the drivel you 're spewing ( already trying to decide my argument one step ahead of me , calling ** my ** mother tongue your own , now that 's ** fucking arrogant ** ) that is closer to `` correct '', 
  you seem to be vastly uninformed about regional accents in america . 
  regional accents are dying out and becoming less and less prominent . 
  the general american accent is by far the most commonly heard in the us ( i would know i 've lived in eight states and all regions of the us ) , and perhaps even takes an absolute majority in percentage of speakers , consider that even in states where regional accents exist strongly , that many speakers ( especially younger ) still speak with a generic american accent . 
  let alone the fact that large states such as california and florida are almost exclusively occupied by general american accented speakers . 
  and my original point was addressing your claim in which you very incorrectly and ignorantly implied that british english was somehow `` more correct '' than us english , which is just absolutely not true !, 
  i 'm from the us and was saying that us english is universally intelligible to english speakers and more so in fact across the board than british english and its sub-varieties ( considering the variety of accents on the whole rather than just the standard general one for either country ) . 
  swiss german , on the other hand is not understood by either austrians or germans ( at least with fluent comprehension ) , hell from i hear even understanding dialects between the cantons can be and issue at times . 
  wrong , at least our version of the language is comprehensible in its own motherland ( unlike schweizdeutsche ) , try again !, 
  also i just remembered what my initial impression of dutch was , coming to visit amsterdam while living in germany at the time - it sounded like someone trying to speak german in a twisted thick scottish accent to me ... how i got that , i do n't know , but that 's my distinct memory of first impressions on the language ... 
  french : lets see how many consonants we can avoid pronouncing - * fin !, 
  hmm i do n't know about the latin bit , i think american english is even more fond of latin languages ( possibly from mexican-spanish influence , this goes two ways ex : us : cell mexico : celular uk : mobile es : m\u00f3vil ) , and definitely more toward euro orthography ex : pasta , taco , tapas ( pronounced in uk vs us accents in all instances us pronounces these food items more or less in their native pronunciation , uk does not `` taaaaahcos '' `` paaahsta '' * cringe * ) . 
  edit : also on the easier to understand bit , please take a journey to the great white north of england and get back to me afterwards !, 
  truth is , as an american to my ears only the top tier of speakers truly develop a distinctive marked accent in either direction . 
  i think since general american tends to be more `` neutral '' ( re : unmarked ) it 's also harder to find late learners that can imitate the accent as well , i 've met many more second-language speakers that have mastered uk accents than us ( obviously not counting those that were either born , or lived in either country for 5 + years ) . 
  anyway , in spite of this as stated because of the prominence of us-english , the general european ( through the own languages typical accent ) tends to indeed err more on the side of us - spoken , but often writing more - british , with word-choice/slang being mixed between the two i 'd say . 
  but for example i 've had many brits come to me and say dutchies speaking english sound just like americans , and to that i respond sure they pronounce aloud in a more us fashion , but if you 're implying that they could almost fool you as a us native ( which some are ) then you must be completely tone-deaf because dutchies definitely have their own distinct accent when speaking english !, 
  haha in the netherlands it 's hard to say . 
  general customer service culture on the commercial side of things - especially restaurants - is severely lacking on the whole . 
  dutch often adopt an attitude of `` if it 's not in my job description , it 's not my problem '' . 
  this attitude tends to seep even into the `` public '' sector ( i.e. 
  gov offices/services/admin . 
  ) , but let so than in the dining industry for example . 
  immigration officials are mostly knowledgeable , friendly , helpful and competent . 
  a big key to getting the most out of dutch service in any sector is to know ** what ** questions to ask , to figure out your parameters in a given interaction . 
  they 'll often be quiet until you ask the right question , and then all the sudden they 're a fountain of information ... other dutch businesses , services , hotlines , ministries aside from the ind ( immigration ) tend to be a bit tricky if you do n't know dutch . 
  despite the `` amsterdam attitude '' - all service-industry employees in the city speaking english by default ( even to other dutchies often ) and often refusing to switch back to dutch if your accent and general proficiency are not on point . 
  anyway despite that , when you have to call these government services , or more day-to-day industries ( health-care providers for example ) they 're much less willing to speak to you in english and more or less expect you to speak dutch , very interesting phenomenom . 
  also this occurs even in amsterdam service industry workplaces if ** you 're ** the one working and thus * serving * the dutch people , they 're attitude 180s and they also expect you to engage with them in dutch , makes sense but also weird contradictory attitude on the whole ... 
  and british `` r '' ? 
  considering general ame is more rhotic than general bre, 
  amsterdam .25 l draft beer at a bar : 2.30-3 $ liter of milk : 1 $ rent for a bedroom in shared apartment : 500-1300 $ per month gram of weed in coffeeshop : 10-18 $ per gram ; outside sources ( non coffeeshop acquaintances ) 6-10 $ per gram eating out sit-down ( with drinks ) : 15-30 $ baguette/bread loaf : 1-3 $ fast food combo meal ( mcd/bk ) : 6.50-8 $ will edit with more later, 
  as someone who 's lived in both countries i constantly seem to flipflop on which is more tolerable on the ear , after nearly 3 years i 'm so used to dutch that i guess it would have to the currently more tolerated language - dus ben ik eens met dat !, 
  well since i hail from the us i think it goes without saying . 
  though i do of have a `` pseudo-general american accent '' that is to say i have a significant distinctly american accent , but also unplaceable even to other americans . 
  that 's because i grew up in eight different states in all regions of the country so my accent picked up features from all over from ny area to the deep south , to the more neutral accented places like washington state . 
  now having spent a substantial amount of time in europe i 've definitely had a hard influence of british seep into my word choice but never my accent or spelling . . vom , the spelling differences are what grate me the most to be frank , those hard `` zs '' in '' - ize '' words ( that 's pronounced `` zee '' not `` zed '' by the way ) would totally kick those wimpy `` ss '' asses ( not arses ) . 
  also occasionally influences of speaking and listening to non-natives have sometimes had slight negative impact on ability to speak 100 % properly/naturally , usually it 's from dumbing down my english when talking to non natives ( to mirror their own off way of speaking ) as a subconscious form of appeasement , not any condescension meant . 
  so you learned american english with british spelling an excess of friendly apologies and a generous sprinkling of `` eh 's '' in there ?!, 
  do you mean non-eu citizens ? 
  as far as i know eu citizenship grants freedom of residence and labor rights to all citizens across and within its borders . 
  non-eu immigrants do have to establish a legitimate purpose of residency in an eu country usually hinging on proving means of financial self-sustainability , but as far as i know here in holland at least if you 're an eu citizen you can reside legally as long as you want , what you do for supporting yourself is not the government 's concern . 
  mena are more likely to speak dutch than eu ( and other western ) migrants , just saying, 
  not my country but until i lived in the netherlands , i was unaware that carice van houten ( the red woman aka melisandre from game of thrones ) was dutch . 
  with fluent castillian spanish and italian it 's largely decipherable , i can half-ass speak it , when i lived there for 6 months was much better , if i had another year or so to spend there , getting fluent would be no problem i think, 
  engels moedertaalspreker hier english native italian and spanish fluent dutch semi-fluent ( close ) german basic knowledge ( can read more now thanks to dutch ) can read quite well and understand at times - catalan , afrikaans , portuguese and a some french, 
  raar in dutch and raro in spanish mean weird/strange , whereas as rare means very uncommon in english . 
  edit : raro in italian also apparently follows the english rare , while `` strano '' is counterpart to strange in english, 
  escobar in spanish is to sweep , in italian scopare can often mean the same , but is more often used to mean `` to fuck '' ( in a sexual way only ) . 
  on that note it even happens between national/regional variants of the same language . 
  for example coger in latin america also means to fuck in a sexual way , but the initial meaning still used in spain is to grab , take or pick up . 
  and do n't get me started on fanny which for us from the us an innocuous term for buttocks ( much the way brits say `` bum '' ) but in the uk it means pussy . 
  yeah but `` haber '' ( avere ) interestingly serves both roles in italian , also it is the shared root word with `` have '' in most latin and germanic languages since hebben in dutch and haben in german are also clearly related, 
  oooh great thread !, 
  not my native tongues but italian and spanish have quite a few . 
  ** tener ** in spanish is to have , but ** tenere ** in italian is to keep or hold . 
  ** salir ** in spanish is to leave or exit , but ** salire ** in italian is to climb . 
  ** molestar ** in spanish is to bother in a more innocuous sense , whereas ** molestare ** has the more perturbed implications of its english counterpart molest . 
  awesome thread , will likely be updating with some more good ones as they come to mind . 
  ** edit : ** also for dutch and german ( was mentioned in another thread ) schoon is clean in the netherlands but in german sch\u00f6n means beautiful ( also in flemish apparently schoon maintains the original meaning from german ) . 
  us - cap and gown italy - laureal wreath, 
  is bacano from brasilero ? 
  both of your two posts sum of my personal experience . 
  white american who as a former `` wigger '' has/had may black friends who would let me say `` n * gga '' but as i 've gotten older i 've come to accept that just because my good black friends are/were cool with me using such a word does n't mean i should . 
  also again as stated in us `` urban '' culture there 's a gaping disparity in the intent behind the `` er '' vs the `` a '' ending of said word . 
  again both of you summed up my feelings and experience perfectly . 
  edit : n * gger is exclusively an offensive slur , be aware of the difference . 
  i know on one hand what you mean , nonetheless in the spirit of conveying the op in a broader more comprehensible manner i opted for such word choice , spoken i would n't use that word , but also again i 'll maintain that your relevance making such a bold claim as non native speaker is a reach at best !, 
  boludo in argentina and cabr\u00f3n in mexico are often used in the same way . 
  in us english asshole or dick can be the same but highly dependent upon the individual to whom you 're speaking and how well you know them, 
  well writing it out spelled with the `` er '' and all is pretty offensive by 21st century anglophone standards and that 's me putting it pretty fucking nicely, 
  ah mola is an important one which i forgot to include . 
  ok sheesh i edited it out already , apologies bitter brits !, 
  well i lived in barcelona , where there 's a lot more spanish influence so it was a bit different , yes everyone ( even the predominantly catalan-speakers i was friends with ) would write `` tio '' ** never ever ** seen `` tiu '' , tio !, 
  i do n't doubt you of course it 's your region of spain but nonetheless in the city as stated the influence of spanish still seeps in hard ( it 's the main language of the city , whether catalans wan na see it or not ; obviously terragona , girona and the like are another story ) . 
  and i 've also seen catalans use xaval yes , are you saying it 's not a thing ? 
  ** round-ii ** english ( us ) : cool , nice , sick , dope , awesome , sweet , wicked , dank , the shit , the tits , tight , lit , clutch , bomb , fire ( this , bomb and dank mostly used for cannabis ) . 
  english ( uk ) : dog 's bollocks , ( bloody ) brilliant castillian spanish : guay , la polla , la leche , de puta madre ( de puta mare in catalan ) , chulo latin spanish : chido , padre , ( bien ) ching\u00f3n - mexico ; barbaro - argentina ; bac\u00e1n - chile and some other countries , they also say bacano as a variant in some other countries ; chevere - colombia/peru/ecuador / venezuela dutch : leuk , lekker ( different depending on the context for which to use ) , also they of course use just oh so lazily as fuck use `` cool '' ( see fb page `` onnodige engelse taal gebruik ) italian : figo , la minchia german : geil,
