  yeah that 's one i 've heard often too , but more referring to females ( pava ) . 
  fam and cuz would fall under us origin the other ones , all yours !, 
  is that related to `` alter '' or stemming from it . 
  i know alter is also used in austria ( despite not being mentioned by any austrians ) because it was taught to me by an austrian rather than a german . 
  edit : maat --  mate ; gast --  guest ; jugne ? 
  really , why 's that ? 
  is it because it 's regarded as too much of a socially stratifying name ? 
  hmm no i 've tried edelwei\u00df wei\u00dfbier and huber i think was the name of it ( from sankt johann ) a few different varieties , and of course a lot of the more commercial ones you 've mentioned . 
  paulaner ? 
  that 's not even austrian alter !, 
  it is indeed bavarian though . 
  anyway it 's not that i think tirolean or austrian beers are bad , but i think i would still have to give the nod to bavarian beers , that said i would much rather live in tyrol than bayern . 
  i really , really love that part of austria/europe - where i learned to snowboard , gorgeous alpine scenery with alpine architecture , good food ( love me some wurst , schnitzel and k\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle ) all things pretty similar with garmisch except the people are much more laid back . 
  i also like that tiroleans at least are adrenaline junkies and have all sorts of cool recreational places ( area 47 springs to mind ) , and innsbruck is definitely in my top-10 most beautiful cities in europe if not the world . 
  if only they had coffeeshops like amterdam ... 
  i hope you 'll accept my apologies , that was certainly one of my poorly-worded , catty `` woke up on the wrong side of the bed posts '' to be fair , you mostly articulated your points in a mature , clear and rational manner so kudos . 
  i do still maintain that you did exemplify quite well this phenomena of euros to deflect a little bit in these situations , but i do n't think it was any sort of intentional malice . 
  i just get annoyed , that europeans ( and in particular dutch ) do seem to think that when they 're compared to americans they 're exempt from this label of racist because they did n't have slavery ( totally not true , because of suriname ) and the current shitshow that is our law enforcement problem in the us . 
  i would like to take my time to address that point now though , as it it seems our policing problem is the new scapegoat to point and cry racism over at the us ( i guess the europeans finally accepted that slavery was over a century ago , and that they also had a large part in propping up the transatlantic trade in the first place ) , anyway the police problem in the us is first and foremost just that , a ** police ** problem , let me asterisk the fuck out of this statement by saying i 'm not downplaying the disadvantage minorities are at , especially when dealing with leos , nonetheless the police problem in the us stems ultimately from a pervasive attitude of brutality , excessive use of force , ego-tripping , control-freaks and lack of instilled deescalation techniques - that is to say ultimately a attitude problem pervading police forces across the country . 
  whites ( not nearly as often ) have also been subjected to some pretty gross displays of police brutality in the us - ex : 20 year drug dealer gets caught in undercover buy as cops rush to his parked car to arrest him he pull out and tries to drive off to which the officer sticks his gun in the window and shoots the kid point-blank killing him , citing to the recording camera bystander that he feared for his safety of being run over ( car was moving from 0 velocity to a reversal speed so not very fast at all ) . 
  case in point the police issue is much bigger than race , though the two have obviously become inextricably linked at this point , it does n't mean that our police problem is exclusively a race problem just to ** reiterate ** , so it should n't always be pointed to as such , as it is something which does affect whites as well . 
  i will say that i do respect dutch cops for the most part ( probably the least intimidating but still competent police i 've seen out of any country i 've been to ) , and think they 're much more competent than their american counterparts , and there is a reason i 'm living in this country after all ( and not in the us ) . 
  groningen also sounds like a cool place , still need to make my way up there sometime . 
  anyway het spijt me for that last post !, 
  have n't spent any significant time in eastern austria ( not even wien , in fact only been to the aforementioned states ) aside from passing through by bus , but i get the vibe from the limited bit i saw , and what i hear/read that the similarities with the central european countries like czech republic ( language aside ) probably are more relevant - nonetheless tirol and bavaria have very , very little differences aside from tiroleans being worse at beer-brewing but better at being chill/laid-back people, 
  addressed this point above , but no way - berlin is distinct out of any of the german-speaking cities world-wide . 
  with tirol and salzburgerland ( both culturally and linguistically - not to mention cuisine - similar to bavaria ) being part of austria , no way is bavaria more similar to berlin . 
  period !, 
  i 'm neither german nor austrian but lived right on the border in deep bayern ( garmish-partenkirchen ) and can confidently say you could n't be more wrong about the bavarians being just as similar to berliners as austrians . 
  bavarian cuisine , dialect and aesthetic are very similar to what 's found in austria ( particularly tirol and salzburgerland ) , mentality is certainly a little different ( tiroleans at least are more laid back than bayerische ) but still far more similar to one another than bavarians are to berliners . 
  bavarians could n't be more different from berliners , and they ( along with a sizeable chunk of the rest of the country ) look at the city as some degenerate capital of their `` federal republic '' . 
  the netherlands does the same ... called an `` orientation year for highly educated migrants '', 
  not the netherlands ... 
  just ask a belgian the meaning of `` poepen '' and you 'll see ... 
  typical european response of semantics and evasive answering . 
  zwarte piet , i 'm just gon na leave that there because at this point every other country is cringing at the ongoing existence of this tradition as you guys blissfully point to your history of tolerance ( and cough suriname ) as an excuse for `` not being racist '' . 
  any nuff said on that !, 
  at least on 3 different separate occasions living here in amsterdam i 've stumbled across a situation with at least 10 + responding police officers ( i.e. 
  at least three law enforcement vehicles on scene ) , to the point it looked like a bomb threat and all three times this mighty mob of politie had come to detain one rogue black man . 
  talk about a sign of a society feeling threatened by black men !, 
  what about that dutch reality tv show where they went to 5 different bars in 5 different dutch towns/cities and had an equally accented/dressed moroccan , african and `` autotoon '' dutch person ( all three nl born and bred ) try to get into the same place , outside of groningen the black and moroccan dutchmen struggled immensely to gain admittance , even in breda where the moroccans managed to get into some bars , blacks where denied to every bar attempted in said town , with one proprietor stating `` the morocccans are fine but the n * gers cause too much problems '' ( he used the dutch translation of the slur with an `` e '' instead of `` i '' after the `` n '' ) case in point , racism is alive and well in holland , that much is true - whether you see it or not , and as immigration increasingly becomes a point of contention in nl and europe the tensions and attitudes will only get worse . 
  is it currently worse in american probably , but the be that as it may , you basically just illustrated the ops point to a tee in your post , brushing off your own problems as nothing and again pointing to the us as fucked up !, 
  had a sneaking suspicion drank en drugs would be mentioned by the nederlanders and lo and behold i was right, 
  iberian spanish - i can on a good day handily fool latinos that i could be spaniard , but spaniards themselves are much tougher to fool with their own accent , though i have managed a few times in shorter conversations , before some slip of the tongue revealed my non-hispanic origins . 
  that 's only living in spain for six months mind you , but i did make a concerted effort to hang out exclusively with spaniards my first year in amsterdam ( after moving here from barcelona ) . 
  italian - i can fool italians abroad with the first few sentences ( but never long-term ) , just because speaking italian outside of italy is much less common than spanish , so if you speak it they just assume by default that you 're italian . 
  also , apparently i have a veneto accent mixed in with the foreign features of my accent in italian , italians even after figuring out that i 'm foreign still guess that i must have learned italian in that region ( which i did ) . 
  which is basically the reaction i get with spanish on a bad day , i do n't always get mistaken for a native speaker , but it 's always evident that i developed my spanish-skills in spain . 
  danish = dutch spoken with helium in the lungs, 
  fun fact , the state 's founders wanted to name it columbia , but opted against in , in fear that it would be confused with the district of columbia ... oh the irony !, 
  i 've worked in service industry jobs in amsterdam , and there 's a lot which do n't even require basic knowledge of nederlands , as long as you 're truly fluent in english they 're content . 
  that said , for exactly the reasons you stated above it is unwise to be working without at decent working knowledge of dutch ( save for de wallen/warmoestraat/dam square parts of town , you can literally get away with purely english in these locales ) . 
  so if somebody stays in switzerland should they learn schweizdeutsche or hochdeutsche ? 
  because the former is the true day to day language in ( german speaking regions ) switzerland , but useless in any other teutonic land . 
  american living in amsterdam here , i can say that even most corporate job announcements ( including those from anglo or multinational parent companies ) have the `` uitstekende beheersing van de nederlandse taal '' under the `` vereisten '' section , so that 's how it is . 
  that 's also specifically in the amsterdam job market , never mind other randstad cities . 
  ca vs co is also a factor , but the subtlety of the spanish j is easier to overlook and harder to master, 
  american here , can confirm that we are taught that norway is the capital of the sweden province in the scandinavian capital of finland . 
  the `` j '' is fricative coming from the bottom of the throat , not unlike a dutch `` g '' '', 
  spare me !, 
  do n't act as if the uk is immune to this phenomenon, 
  i think despite being a germanic language on paper , in practice english falls somewhere between the latin and germanic language groups , meaning that when we actually put in the effort we native english speakers are at an advantageous starting point for learning most western european languages . 
  in other words i find both spanish and dutch quite similar to english but in different ways . 
  in reference to the part about one `` essentially being bavaria '', 
  more than twice that , a half liter/pint of draft pils goes for 4-5 $ in amsterdam , average right at 4.50 $, 
  oh well , i 'm saying your part of the sovereign nation of spain as it stands right now and that is the only sovereign nation of which you are part of , so i clarify again , what 's your thought about the spanish flag , in your region of ** spain ** ? 
  visca espanya ... just kidding , i 'll duck that brick and see myself out now !, 
  side note , the symbolism is something i wo n't delve into , but aesthetic-wise the estelada is perhaps the best looking politico-national flag i 've seen , imho !, 
  topic at hand : well in america i do n't think i even have to explain , even ironic eurotrash and hipsters the world over utilize our flag on t-shirts , towes , and especially bathing suits/shorts !, 
  edit : though , since technically you do still reside in `` el re\u00edno de espa\u00f1a '' , care to weigh in on its `` bandera '' ? 
  a dickhead president and several degrees fahrenheit in annual average temps ? 
  i feel like all these apply to austria 's relationship with germany ( especially tirol ) more than de-ch , except for the part about eu-membership ... 
  hmm this is an interesting phenomena to say the least . 
  i 've noticed it the same with a lot of the me-descended ( mostly moroccan ) dutch nationals here in the amterdam . 
  a lot of them are definitely second generation and speak perfectly fluent dutch , but with the distinctive me-accent , which even i can hear as a non-native dutch speaker - so i can indeed imagine a similar picture forming in dk . 
  anyway , for those of them that do speak english this accent carries over to english as well . 
  however , for whatever reason , maybe anglo culture is more conducive to linguistic-integration , in both the us & uk , in my experience i 've met met many people of middle-eastern descent that speak with a proper american or british accent of their given state/region/city , so not sure what is the cause of that ... 
  what about schengen and freedom of movement , residence and labor rights among eu-citizens ? 
  ma dio can vecio !, 
  sud-tirol maybe would leave because they feel more german , but i think the region still has a lot of italian-speakers so that could put a wrench in things , not to mention what you just said . 
  sicily , they 're an island , and they feel distinct among italians but it 's also the most economically depressed part of italy , they do n't stand to gain much from independence . 
  veneto also has some rumblings of a grassroots movement . 
  they have a distinct dialect ( and relatively well preserved/in-tact by northern italian standards ) , and identity within italy and at least within the country they 're one of the more economically sound regions , so i could see them actually gaining more traction than the other two you mentioned be honest . 
  hmm gon na have to at least partially disagree with that . 
  first of all , in spain the second highest level ( after federal/central ) of governance/administrative regions is an `` autonomous community '' , that 's just the nomenclature they use , just like we say states , canada say provinces , italy says regions , germany also says state . 
  andalusia for example , is also an `` autonomous community '' meaning that it is on the same level of governance as catalonia . 
  it 's like comparing california to new york . 
  catalan is a nationality in the sense that they 've made great strides in more global recognition of their language , identity , culture , etc. 
  but it still like andalusia is an ac ( and still has yet to attain independence ) , furthermore in a more purely physical geographical ( not geopolitical ) sense they both can be considered `` regions '' of spain . 
  anyway , if you 're being purely political in your definition , from an ir standpoint neither scotland or catalonia are true sovereign nation-states , so again that calls that into question how legit your label of nation is based on your very arbitrary criteria for what constitutes a nation or community , but thanks for telling us twice your condescending tone was duly noted . 
  case in point , both scotland & catalonia the the second-highest tier of administrative regions in their respective countries ( sovereign nation-states ) . 
  yeah in the netherlands , which is probably only beat by the scandinavian countries for speaking english as a second language you get the typical dutch response of them immediately switching to english , which can be frustrating . 
  anyway , since the scandos seem to have even better mastery of the language i can imagine that being an expat and wanting to learn a scandinavian language is a struggle for the same reason , perhaps even worse !, 
  hmmm american here , so my results are hardly surprising . 
  interestingly , i did get dutch as one of my potential mother-tongues . 
  furthermore , in the follow-up questions they asked after generating my results it asked about countries i 've lived in for six-months or longer ; as well as where i currently reside ( the netherlands ) , so perhaps they 're on to something . 
  anway my results : our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  american ( standard ) 2 . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics 3 . 
  canadian our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 .
