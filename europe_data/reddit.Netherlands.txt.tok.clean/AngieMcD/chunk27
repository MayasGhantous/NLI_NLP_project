  for the most part these airbnbs are in the same ( popular ) neighborhoods as the hotels . 
  certainly the commercial ones . 
  spurious correlation if i ever saw one . 
  hotels do n't drive up real-estate prices i assume ? 
  there are real problems with airbnb but this is not one of them . 
  our tricolor is older i believe . 
  the oldest extant in fact . 
  it 's not iconic . 
  you 're seriously deluded if you believe that our ` bleeding heart ' refugee policy is for anything other than domestic consumption . 
  the world does n't give a shit . 
  look how trump was welcomed by the arab leaders after his muslim ban . 
  nobody gives a shit beyond the 15min news cycle . 
  that 's something we lack in europe atm . 
  we already have kebab shops when can we expect these particular fruits of the multicultural society ? 
  macron says we need more of this wonderful culture in europe . 
  i wonder if he 's right ... 
  the french flag isnt iconic at all . 
  standard red white blue tricolor . 
  you can recognize the spanish one by the colors alone . 
  same reason why the brazilian one is more iconic than the french . 
  or even the german though that one is hampered by the standard tricolor horizontal template . 
  which is more iconic , the dutch red white blue of our national color orange ? 
  same reason . 
  orange is uniquely ours . 
  hah , pretty depressing for islam then that this is what it takes, 
  real cool . 
  did n't know about this one . 
  guess i wo n't donate to amnesty either then . 
  tally : amnesty , doctors without borders . 
  any others i should know about ? 
  what 's wrong with the current flag ? 
  it 's iconic . 
  moreso than the italian , french or ours anyway . 
  i saw one while snorkeling in tenerife . 
  there 's a spot where the tours go in a little bay , you just swim where they are swimming . . lol, 
  most of the eu has been more progressive than the us for a while . 
  reaganism happened in europe before the us . 
  so did the new populism . 
  maybe it 's more : parts of europe -  us -  rest of europe, 
  well let 's get to work . 
  africa is n't getting a shortage in their supply of unwanted hostiles . 
  surprised russia is so religious . 
  it 's a shit spectrum . 
  a 5 % country looks about the same as a 30 % country . 
  with this gradual shift it looks like they 30 % country is only slightly more atheist . 
  pfff , i used to think we were exceptionally atheist in nl . 
  i mean they are far more westernized if that 's the case . 
  too bad communism is so fucking awful then . 
  might just be the cure the muslim world needs . 
  that 's not saying much at all . 
  there 's a massive difference between drinking , eating pork and celebrating christmas and the muslims in the west . 
  i hope this does n't become a new phonespergout meme . 
  must have something to do with france, 
  if that 's the criteria . 
  should n't the best trolls . 
  be france ? 
  what 's so special about norway . 
  i love how many ppl hate the french, 
  if that 's the criteria . 
  should n't the best trolls .

  just because saudi is bad does n't mean qatar is good . 
  qatar are one of the main sources of islamist support and wahhabi support worldwide . 
  al-jazeer is an islamist propaganda outlet ( mainly the arabic version ) . 
  and mb is no less dangerous than isis ( at least for mena itself ) and should be squashed like the cockroaches they are . 
  why is he not out of a job . 
  username checks out . 
  if this sort of garbage were espoused back in 2015 i could live with it . 
  but this moron is talking in 2017 . 
  what the hell is wrong with germany ? 
  i think it 's kind of silly at this point to call 50 % of the electorate far-right but i see where the convention comes from . 
  then again , i would term van der bellen far-left so i guess it 's fair . 
  but that requires a larger political goal . 
  this savage may simply hate fpo supporters and therefore killed these that he personally knew . 
  because he hated them . 
  maybe the goal was n't to spread fear or achieve some larger political goal . 
  i voted fvd . 
  it 's the same without the demagoguery and therefore no cordon-sanitaire and no social-leprosy ( though still lots of impotent far-left hysteria ) .
