works fine now . 
  and very revealing statistics indeed !, 
  especially the decrease in employment . 
  people fleeing the labour market for various reasons . 
  i did so myself and my motivation was at least half determined by the present economic situation . 
  it 's not a good time to be in your 20s . 
  my attempt at a shitty tutorial , assuming english windows : 1 . 
  click the start button 2 . 
  search `` snipping tool '' 3 . 
  drag the rectangle around the area you want in your image 4 . 
  save the image ( if happy with the result , otherwise click `` new '' to try again ) 5 . 
  click `` upload images '' somewhere near the top 7 . 
  click `` browse your computer '' i got stuck at this step because imgur is blocked here and the vpn does n't work properly . 
  i believe you can select multiple images at this point ( using ctrl ) in case you want to make an album . 
  otherwise just upload and link them one-by-one . 
  just see if you feel like going through the trouble . 
  otherwise this is a good reference for next time . 
  i 'm afraid you ca n't simply copy the urls . 
  perhaps you could post screenhots to imgur ? 
  by your description , it would be relevant to the discussion . 
  now if you could track data later than 2011 you would create a really interesting comparison . 
  geenstijl is great at playing the devil 's advocate role . 
  that makes it refreshing to put it next to the regular channels . 
  king willem-alexander whispering to a mysterious obscured individual . 
   it 's just a giant mess . 
  just like the linked article 's way of presenting data . 
  because it wants to control its frontiers and preferably extend them . 
  they provide buffers to the core territory . 
  there 's relatively little of that in european russia . 
  they also lack natural borders . 
  it 's a difficult territory to defend . 
  edit : the video [ posted by / u/poteott below ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dhqvt/eu_warning_over_russia_land_grab_in_south_ossetia/ct5dum2 ) explains this very well . 
  even more problematic , it leads to perverse strategic voting incentives . 
  there was recently an opinion piece from [ verhofstadt ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3544pn/guy_verhofstadt_an_eu_for_full_members_only/ ) about this as well . 
  i think it 's a great way of starting to address the inherent structural issues causing the dysfunction of the eu . 
  i meant in comparison to a number of earlier generations . 
  i also was mostly thinking of western europe . 
  despite your stab at it , this is actually a serious issue within the affected societies . 
  to be fair , all europe 's youth is going through hard times , just not as hard as greece 's . 
  it 's not a good time to be in your 20 's . 
  seems he really can get the discussion going . 
  i deny everything . 
   hey een nederlander the place is swarming with dutch . 
  might be my first time encountering `` to vituperate '' . 
  sure we have [ big ideas ] ( http://www.diebergkomter.nl/ ) , regardless of feasibility . 
  not sure why you 're getting downvoted , because the relative statistics are indeed the really interesting data . 
  it 's much more related to the carrying capacity . 
  sweden is the real shocker here , almost twice as much as any other eu country . 
  edit : and the relatively low numbers of italy and spain show how much asylum seekers move on the other eu countries . 
  he guessed belgium , but i think you 're dutch . 
  silver lining : the smaller the population the less intimidating ukraine would be as a new eu member . 
  it 's starting to approach poland 's population . 
  this is a serious consideration when regarding turkey . 
  so that would be the vmbo-bb final dutch exam , right ? 
  the 2015 exam is posted [ right here ] ( https://www.examenblad.nl/examen/nederlands-bb-vmbo/2015/vmbo-bb?topparent=vga3db3c9od5 ) . 
  it seems to involve understanding the text and writing a piece . 
  i 've seen it done with pieces of pottery . 
  only 20 ~ 30 % of the original remained , so they reconstructed the pottery using a clean white color for the recreated parts . 
  i think it 's a reasonable approach . 
  it 's better than presenting a few jumbled shards . 
  this is nothing short of bullshit . 
  greece deserves the eu 's support in this crisis . 
  border control and migrant management are something we need to deal with as a union , not something to dump on an already troubled greece ( and to a lesser extend , italy and spain ) . 
  quite . 
  if he acknowledges mistakes have been made , that cautionary visits from the police are intimidating by nature and assures this wo n't happen again , he would n't look like a massive twat . 
   i used to cross two former international borders on my way to work from aachen , crossing limburg into belgium ? 
  just guessing . 
  that one really could n't possibly be correct . 
  so what you 're saying is , now we 're finally * free * ? 
  the data is limited to the 81st barometer because that 's when the question stopped being asked ? 
  quite . 
  i thought it 's generally overrated . 
  now i wonder whether flanders has the dutch rate and wallonia has the french rate . 
   people will kill over those photos . 
  that is very likely . 
  but being willing to kill over these photo 's requires a very twisted mindset . 
  normal people would n't kill over these pictures . 
  it 's just like with the danish mohamed cartoons . 
  lethal consequences of these pictures are symptoms of a societal problem . 
  neither burkini laws nor their enforcement are the root cause . 
  or when visiting a country where squatting toilets are still the norm . 
  just a pun . 
  which would be clickbait since it suggests a crime rather than police officers enforcing the law . 
  yeah , that headline is pretty clear . 
  that 's why i said it 's a misunderstanding . 
  since a 2017 trigger of article 50 means a 2019 brexit . 
  found [ the article ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-date-article-50-eu-referendum-result-europe-theresa-may-a7189851.html ) as well , and i was a bit off . 
  seems the news was that article 50 would be triggered late 2017 instead of early 2017 , so a late 2019 brexit instead of early 2019 . 
  i thought it was a misunderstanding , created by those not carefully reading the news articles . 
  the news was that the uk would ** leave ** in 2019 , i.e. 
  trigger article 50 in 2017 . 
  this was news because theresa may initially stated her intention to trigger it late 2016 , i.e. 
  leave in 2018 . 
   [ folli follie ] ( http://stuffpoint.com/rainbows/image/82839-rainbows-rainbow-spongebob.jpg ) this is going to need some explanation . 
  [ thank god for romania ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thank_god_for_mississippi ), 
  it 's a bit like what happened with the netherlands in 2014 . 
  ended up in [ 5th overall position ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_winter_olympics_medal_table ) with only medals from [ speed skating and short track speed skating ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netherlands_at_the_2014_winter_olympics#medalists ) . 
  the netherlands is in a fairly good position to forge ahead with such proposals . 
  in 2015 , nearly 10 % of cars sales in the netherlands were electric ( either full or hybrid ) .
