  as to surstr\u00f6mming , it 's swedish fermented herring in a can which is under pressure from ongoing fermentation . 
  it 's supposed to smell absolutely rancid with equal taste and there are many videos on youtube of people trying ( and failing ) to eat it due to it 's unappealing nature . 
  [ here 's an example of someone who gets relatively far without throwing up . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgv2imaocao ) there are more extreme reactions in the related section if you so wish . 
  have a good day indeed on the other side of the pond !, 
  did you personally inquire ? 
  then why formulate in a general remark and not a question ? 
  that would have gotten you a completely different response . 
  still , we were only talking about one thing in this whole comment line , i 'm not going to switch subjects out of the blue with someone of whom i know through flair that they 're from another country and language . 
  that to me seems logical , like for you your apparent inquiry was . 
  no reason to get on the high horse or namecalling . 
  we 're already doing a good job with our neighbours , protecting collective airspace and sharing bases together with belgium and there 's the [ dutch-german army corps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i._german/dutch_corps ) . 
  it would be a good thing for them to leave , but it 's their main strategy to stay the nr . 
  1 superpower since they ca n't exert it economically anymore so highly unlikely . 
  that 's also what those free trade agreements like ttip and the likes are for , attempts to keep the ball on ` our ' side of the fence for longer . 
  oh no no it 's exclusively done between peers , but for example , having an academic group project with people you only know from that course , and they already do it after meeting them a few times . 
  where i 'm from it 's only done with close relations and family , and it 's a direct kiss on the cheek , not this ` kissing in the air while touching cheeks ' kind of thing which i 've also encountered there . 
  perhaps because it 's so common for them . 
  the parents on which i commented were on a greeting kissing ritual , if through my discourse on how they do it in france and wallonia with a sudden french phrase in between someone ca n't connect the dots that it 's the subject itself there 's always google . 
  askeurope does n't mean eli5 . 
  kinda hard to make that out if you put in just a single word . 
  do n't roll too much , you might bump your head . 
  when you become 16/17 here you get a letter stating that it 's still possible when decreed but it 's lifted for a professional army . 
  also , what 's your reference nation and target , or the whole of europe has draftphobia ? 
  well okay , so it 's limited to close friends and family , we have that here too especially when congratulating someone . 
  when you pass on into wallonia or france though it becomes a greeting/goodbye like shakings hands here , it 's sooo uneasy when you 're not into the custom and barely know those people . 
  the amount of times to ` faire la bise ' also varies , which can leave you hanging . 
  it is n't systematic genocide to have a system in place where people are tortured and/or executed if they do not bring in the required amount of rubber ? 
  that the goal was economic as to a direct will to have a people go into extinction does n't make it any less genocidal , the congolese were non-human dispensible tools to them if you look at their treatment . 
  the number is anywhere between 1 and 15 million depending on who you ask so it could be better , it could be worse . 
  it is n't ` the belgian people ' who have blood on their hands in leo 's case since congo was his private property , he is directly responsible and therefore has to be buried as a black page in history . 
  as to ` banning ' the us , what do you mean , but looking those politicians in the eye and having the law be over them yes . 
  hilly & billy deserve prison but for some reason justice does n't reach the upper echelons all that well in the us . 
  the same goes for kissinger . 
  if you say europe 's great history is nothing to apologize for or feel bad about that 's willfull ignorance of the dark part of the past . 
  i 've known people who fought in the former dutch indies as conscripts , i pay respects to those young boys who were sent to the other side of the globe without a choice at the nearby memorial . 
  the moment i visit modern indonesia i will also visit their independance memorials to pay due respects with repent for the war crimes commited by the dutch . 
  vicarious shame is n't a bad thing you know , it keeps things from happening again . 
  six million jews and five million others during the holocaust and the whole world reviles the nazi 's and hitler , 10 million africans and leo still sits on his bustes and horses and what have you . 
  it 's a disgrace , he might have developed the country and brought wealth but he should be torn down since the prosperity was brought with rivers of blood and cut off hands . 
  every bullet casing had to be accounted for with a hand to prove the killing was cost effective . 
  seeing that demon 's statue still sit at the beach of oostende baffled me , every time i passed it he recieved a phlegm from the back of the troat . 
  edit : do n't get me wrong here , i also cringe every time i hear a dutchman gloryfying the ` voc mentality ' . 
  trump has been racing down the polls with all the dumb stuff he 's been spouting like asking for someone to shoot hillary , he 's self-destructing just fine . 
  i think there would be enough of a gap there for bernie to make a real chance had he not gone with her . 
  electing hillary is just as much a failure as trump is , and perhaps even more , since instead of blatant ignorance it 's cunning behind closed doors that makes her dangerous . 
  he would get himself impeached quickly ( which could give bernie the chance to run once more concidering his age ) , while she might sit out the ride . 
  trump would be stopped even when elected because he is such a loonie , she would n't . 
  i still hope for some strike of god for bernie to run independently , he would easily beat hilldawg and that orange thing . 
  instead he chose to be muzzled , i just do n't get it , trump would never win anyway and he would have made the us a great place . 
  but yeah , this is best done through official channels , the very best of luck in the process my future compatriot !, 
  a-2 level dutch is doable , especially since it 's really close to english in the language family . 
  the sequence is a1 & 2 , b1 & 2 , c1 & 2 with c2 being mother language , a2 is well within reach in the 5 years you would have to spend here before you could potentially naturalize into a dutch citizen . 
  [ common eu framework of reference for languages wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_european_framework_of_reference_for_languages ) [ immigration and naturalisation service gov ' t page ] ( https://ind.nl/en/individuals/pages/default.aspx ), 
  here you go my man : it was opgezwolle at first between rico and sticks but their dj quit in 2007 , hence they parted . 
  it became the fakkelbrigade with typhoon , a.r.t. 
  and james . 
  they also produce their own music . 
  [ opgezwolle - hoedenplank ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83g5kc-eb28 ) [ opgezwolle - made in nl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy9qmuytduk ) [ opgezwolle - de volle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihaidz3k0iy ) [ opgezwolle - vroeger & nu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0lngjdlm2w ) [ fakkelbrigade - colucci ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_svchrt414 ) [ fakkelbrigade - groen gras ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk88bmteglw ) [ typhoon & co. - zandloper ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jhfnchen3s ) [ typhoon - liefste ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwejvrh3ni8 ) ( not rap , still a good song ) [ rico & a.r.t. 
  - opa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j06fvired80 ) [ sticks & delic - spaanse vlieg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftk7voud9om ) and some old-skool dutch rap , mainly extince who was one of ( or the ) founder of the genre , since it was looked down upon and shunned before . 
  ` rapping in dutch , what would that sound like ? 
  repperdeklep-de-klep-klep-klep ' was said on the radio . 
  brainpower came shortly after .

  - mijn stad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn5cjb2wgqu ), 
  and them together in fakkelbrigade/opgezwolle , or old school master lyricism in the man that is extince or perhaps brainpower . 
  hehehe , you can only handle so much weltherrschaft at a time !, 
  ... have you heard of our lord and saviour , bernie sanders ? 
  hmm , other question then , do you guys also have snorting tobacco ( snuff ) ? 
  it 's of course niche because you look like ( well , are ) a druggo but that still exists in the netherlands . 
  if you add aroma 's to it it becomes chewing tobacco which is also a tobacco-based product but still legal here . 
  the drawings , plans , all that already exist . 
  it 's a proven concept and there have been small test reactors . 
  we just never took it up after going down the uranium path . 
  since the element is 3-4x more common then uranium starting a mining or refining op would n't take much time either . 
  the old paradigm does n't stand with these reactors since they ca n't have a meltdown , you ca n't make weapons from them and their waste half-life is in manageable levels . 
  these are new-style not old , and could be the finishing blow to fossil fuel plants . 
  we should n't lock ourselves in nuclear indeed , but it could be a viable resource during the cross-over period and a good alternative to what we have right now . 
  wait , snus is illegal in the eu ? 
  ... why ? 
  oh boy , the day someone offered it to me and told me explicitly not to swallow the copious amounts of saliva you get from it , i did of course thinking it could never be that bad and near instant puking was the result . 
  strong stuff huh . 
  or we could switch to better forms of nuclear energy instead , like thorium molten salt reactors . 
  this would probably be quicker and more effective then trying to switch to renewables completely , the night-time lows would be taken care of and those reactors are better in many ways . 
  you ca n't realisticly make weapons out of its waste products , they need power/resources to stay on instead of stable like current reactors ( we 're on top of shabby tihange too so this is my nr . 
  1 ) , the half-life of its waste is much more managable and it is such a common element that every nation could be energy-independent . 
  i get what you 're saying , but solar ( although advancing quickly ) wo n't be the sole solution to our biggest threat which is climate change . 
  we still need nuclear to reach the no co2-goal but it would be wise to get rid of uranium reactors . 
  dear mods , please mention ( in small cursive or something ) the location you are currently showing in the header as to avoid constant questions where it is this week , it looks great !, 
  you might have a long national anthem of which only part is sung for practicality , or you can have a musical piece of which only part is official national anthem and the rest of it is n't . 
  immersion learning is the best learning if you 're fond of taking a culture/language bath !, 
  as a linguist all i can say is , the frontier is but yourself . 
  well , then compare nl and de considering the firearm deaths , we have nearly half your rate while our police shot 2x more then yours ( 158 incidents of which 70 warning shots and 4 accidentals ) with a population 4.5 times smaller . 
  police brutality has to be tackled of course , that one you sent me is really bad and there was [ this case ] ( http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/videozone_eng/1.2376275 ) in belgium last year . 
  does n't mean i cherish bad feelings against police , there 's no reason to and it would only be asking for unnecesary trouble while there 's full blown military patting me down to get on a train in brussels . 
  do n't want to be the nervous guy causing an itchy trigger finger even though it does make you uncomfortable , they 're only trying to protect us . 
  i do n't hate a person just doing his job , you should hate the ones that step out of order but not generalize . 
  same with muslims and the terror attacks , ca n't possibly hate 1.6 billion people for the actions of some bad apples . 
  yesterday there was the story of the man who was on his hands and knees begging for his life who got shot five times by us police , our cops are shooting relatively much lately but german cops in total used less bullets in a whole year then us police on one single person ( 86 vs 90 ) abuse of powers or mistakes happen , with nobody with lethal power we 'd be in chaos and with everyone with that power we 'd be in the wild west . 
  does n't mean we should tolerate unlawful killing , but here in nl the moment a cop shoots someone he is considered a criminal until proven lawful and has to leave the scene asap for others to investigate the crime scene and take over .
