they had since march when this shit started to come up with an alternative to `` let 's pay the enemy $ 1.45 billion with no guarantees they 're not going to fuck us over come winter time . '', 
  it 's a buyer 's market . 
  i think his point is : why would you pay the bills to an enemy you 're in open conflict with ? 
  just find another supplier of fuels and let em suffocate on their financial sanctions . 
  a british tourist liberated greece from the nazis ? 
  how have i not heard this story before ? 
  i do n't think the brits were trying to fuck with you rather than make the observation  look on the bright side , we 've all learned something today about our languages . 
  i ca n't wait for the pope to lead the popal-army into syria .

  no , we use our hands .

  well considering our trading companies were also the military and the dutch war-machine on several occasion sank large parts of the english and french fleets ... 
  i 'd say hatred probably is appropriate . 
  it was also common practice to hire and equip pirates to attack vessels of competitors . 
  we also have - [ bokkereyers .

  a more correct title would have been :  all smoke and mirrors : the dutch pension plan, 
  fucking love that stuff .

  i think he means the open borders and more freedom to work in eu countries . 
  i believe that 's what he means by `` turks walking the streets '' . 
  like western europe now has a large eastern european work-force . 
  arabs and north africans have to become nationals first . 
  i think you understand me yes , if i read your first part correctly . 
  i 'll just drive the point home with some more examples :p ** objective phrasing : ** `` president obama yesterday stated in a press conference that hilary clinton broke into the oval office . '', 
  ** non-objective phrasing : ** `` president obama yesterday in a press conference lied about hilary clinton having broken into the oval office . '', 
  ** balanced reporting : ** `` the cia has released a statement saying that a secret drone was captured by russia . 
  the kremlin has denied these allegation in a formal response . '', 
  ** un-balanced reporting : ** `` the cia has released a statement saying that a secret drone was captured by russia . '', 
  what i 'm trying to say is that the difference between the first two statements is far more significant than the difference between the last two . 
  people will perhaps be upset not to hear the kremlin statement in the last one and protest the unbalanced nature of the report but ... the language is objective and still useful whereas the non-objective phrasing will actively poise readers to believe obama is a liar . 
  edit : hence my belief that objectivity is a far better qualifier than balancing and my suspicion of claims of unbalanced reporting because it 's the go-to tool for the oppressive or the bigoted to discredit the independent press . 
  edit2 : this was my favorite line from your post :  if you were a journalist and you tried to portray a particular stance as objectively correct you 'd lose your job ( unless you work at a shit paper ) . 
  i completely agree and i do n't think that would even be possible . 
  since we 're jiving about science : i really enjoyed quantum physics in college because it assumes we * do n't * know certain aspects of a problem where newtonian physics demands us to make assumptions about what we do n't know . 
  as it turned out dealing in * un * certainty and chance ( objective distance let 's say ) yielded better results after all . 
  this step back in the model actually revolutionized the fields of chemistry as well as physics . 
  so instead of * portraying a particular stance as objectively correct * you are * objectively portraying a stance * , correct or not is up to the reader . 
  in case of political parties i 'd prefer in-depth over balanced . 
  if i want to see their political opponents hack away at their political foundations and world-views a public debate would be more suited , or a documentary about general political climate where the political landscape is outlined . 
  imo to get to know a party like ukip there 's no benefit to be had with balance . 
  i think balanced might be a symptom of a lack of trust in viewers to form opinions . 
  as if by only showing one side every viewer would side with them all of a sudden . 
  it 's obviously tempting in that line of thinking to get soundbites from political opponents but i think this just sacrifices depth and is n't even needed . 
  let the other parties have their own 20 minute documentary if you feel the need to blast every conceivable opinion at your viewers . 
   you seem to be saying that if a journalist puts forward a completely one sided point of view , that it can be objective , but a reporter who shows you an array of different material from different sides is somehow not objective , because they 're balanced ? 
  yes that 's what i mean , especially the first part . 
  i 've had a long discussion with folks in r/ukrainianconflict about this so it might help to use the ua conflict as an example . 
  western journalists are not welcome in the dnr . 
  vice 's simon ostrovsky was thrown in a basement and beaten up 3 days straight and lots of reporters have been threatened or actually received similar abuse . 
  needless to say there are no western journalists in dnr . 
  the russian users think that rt is a more reliable news-source because they are balanced in a sense that they can report from both sides unscathed ( and they do ) . 
  they do n't seem to care rt uses language that is * extremely * biased and does n't even pretend to be objective , they just care about balance . 
  i submit to you that the western sources ( albeit scarce and one-sided ) are infinitely more objective and therefor more reliable . 
  i do * not * mean balanced reporting * can not * be objective , it can even be more objective than a one-sided report out of necessity ( and often is ) . 
  i just made a point that when the word ` balanced ' is used to refer to a report it 's usually by a horribly biased , bigoted hate - or conspiracy theorist group to discredit independent journalism . 
   surely if you 're given even an objective piece of reporting which only shows you one side of the argument , that is still subpar because you are not really being given a chance to understand the wider context or any sort of criticism of these ideas . 
  subpar relative to what ? 
  i mean obviously there are a lot of stories where it can be helpful to get a perspective from multiple sides but for objectivity it 's not required and it definitely does n't have to be in the same article . 
  a documentary i think is really cool to illustrate this is ` collapse ' . 
  it 's completely one-sided ; just michael ruppert talking and explaining his world-view over shots of historic and recent events . 
  you wo n't be able to discern the views of the documentary makers because they leave themselves out of it completely . 
  it 's just a really intimate portrait of a man with unusual ideas . 
  whether you end up thinking he 's a genius prophet or a troubled schizophrenic is completely up to the viewer and will be different for everyone . 
  as someone that 's had a lot of chemistry education i can assure you true balance is equally unattainable . 
  furthermore you are absolutely correct objectivity in the purest sense might not even exist but that does not mean the term can not be used . 
   rather than the journalism trying to portray an objectivity , which is only a veneer for their own partiality . 
  this would be kind of insulting to a self-respecting journalist . 
  so much in their careers hinges on separating their opinion from their report that it 's kind of blunt to dismiss their professionalism as ` only a veneer ' . 
  the same tactics are used to discredit climate-scientists even though there is extremely deliberate method from hypothesis to theory to eventual consensus with observable evidence . 
  similar processes and standards for establishing truth are used by for example historians and indeed journalists . 
  choosing balance over objectivity as the next best thing - in the illusion that such a thing is more attainable - means practically dismissing any possibility of establishing truth because of the possibility of imperfection . 
  edit : would you rather have a photograph to see what color a flower is or would you prefer two people shouting red/blue from two sides . 
  the balanced answer will tell you it 's purple while it may actually be green . 
  even a red-biased photograph ( reporter ) will show you it 's yellow , which is closer to green . 
   what kind of qualifier would you put in front of a documentary to assure people of its quality ? 
  `` objective '' . 
  balanced sounds like you have to go look for perceived good or bad aspects to a story to even it out , or like you 're obligated to ask the opposing party for their views . 
  imo an objective piece can be a completely one sided portrait from one side of an issue whereas a balanced piece can still be extremely biased . 
  to me key is the reporter does n't use language that hints at what their own opinion might be and does n't suggest quotes and opinions they gather can be taken on authority . 
  for example the wording to convey what obama said should be the same as the phrasing to convey what an isis-spokesman said . 
  fair enough . 
  it 's just that ` balanced ' leaves an extremely bad taste in my mouth since it 's not the same as ` objective ' and the main slogan used by insane radicals trying to slander independent journalism . 
  balanced to me spells artificial biased shopping until the piece ` balances out ' . 
  objectivity to me is using objective language and reporting on the facts . 
  definitely not ss insignias , tell me at which point in the video those appear . 
  they 're using the wolfsangel and the black sun . 
  both germanic pagan-occult symbols that predate nazism .
