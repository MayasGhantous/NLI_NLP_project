  nice backpaddling . 
   he is no longer , however , a practicing religious jew . 
  he did n't even say that lol . 
   i will no longer justify you with a response . 
  i 'm glad . 
  if i had to listen to more of your moronic self-righteous bullshit i would 've puked . 
  go screw yourself with concertina wire . 
   the artist has said he is not a jew . 
  no he has n't you fucking idiot . 
   fascist pig . 
  ah the insults of a lesser mind . 
  always fun . 
  usually they call me a lefty race-traitor , i suppose this evens it out a bit . 
  forgive me for taking an interest that 's forbidden to goy like me . 
  you 're extremely annoying you know that ? 
  take your westerbork comment and shove it up your self-righteous ass . 
  i 'm serious though , it 's not a religion like islam or christianity . 
  it spans a lot of aspects that contribute to what jews consider being jewish . 
  many jews are secular and do n't even believe in god . 
  that 's coming from jewish scholars . 
  you ca n't stop being jewish . 
  sphere of influence is a bullshit term maintained by russia to justify undermining the autonomy of sovereign nations . 
  we 're about 40 years past that . 
  if they want close ties with their neighbors they should be * good neighbors * , not try to force it at gunpoint . 
  yeah that was totes not a betrayal from france , uk and us nato command / s http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ambassador-muhamed-sacirbey/smoking-gun-on-betrayal-g_b_7745846.html shameful shit . 
  with allies like that who needs enemies ? 
  you mean the same english that were always picking fights with the dutch and got so utterly wrecked they had to go beg the french for help to not get annexed by a tiny republic ? 
  yeah very impressive lot lol . 
  very much this . 
  they probably wo n't flip the table in ukraine until they 've slowly and effectively bled it completely dry . 
  they 're much too comfortable lobbing arty at ua from their side of the border and sneaking materials and forces across to assist the terrorists where necessary . 
  only if i get to be rose in the titanic re-enactment . 
  i think they all want to be on the live stream . 
   by the way i doubt that mein kampf details plans for the formation of the sa - it was established in 1920 . 
  ah yes you 're quite right , my bad !, 
  how about no . 
  you need a history lesson here . 
  hitler wrote his mein kampf in 23-25 in prison after a ** failed coup ** . 
  that book is full of outright ** hate speech and racism ** . 
  it lays out plans for the formation of the ** sturmabteilung ** . 
  there 's no way in hell his party would n't have been outlawed in modern germany or any other civilized european country for that matter . 
  that court case would 've been open and shut . 
  more successfully obfuscating parties are banned by judges all over europe on a yearly basis . 
   so by banning extremists ' parties you force them to take a lesson from the nazis and simply be less open about there goals . 
  there 's no rule that says they get free reign after election so who gives a fuck . 
  let them try . 
  judges are n't retarded . 
  it 's not impossible to get back on your feet but you have to be very lucky to be in the right town , meet the right social workers , manage to deal with your own issues and comply with requirements etc. . . basically when you become homeless you 're pretty much fucked and your outlook is extremely bleak . 
  in theory that 's possible . 
  in practice it 's very complicated . 
  homeless people do n't get welfare . 
  he 's wrong . 
  no they do n't . 
  you need to have an address registered with the city or town you live in to be eligible for any kind of welfare . 
  no home , no income . 
  he 's right you know . 
  the judicial system is supposed to watch over modern democracies and outlaw parties that strive to form undemocratic governments or violate the constitution . 
  these are the lessons we learned from history and that 's why you ca n't compare a modern democracy to germany 's at the time of hitler 's election . 
  yeah but you only have like four seconds to do it so that 's not going to help the swedes . 
  we have different values than the us and our democracies are organized accordingly . 
  any confusion from any side just stems from disinterest . 
  in european countries there 's no ambivalence to the limits of free speech and usually this is clearly outlined in their constitutions . 
  that 's what happened in australia . 
  their biggest porn company is now in amsterdam . 
  thanks australia !, 
   that 's just musing -- i 'm not an international relations guy . 
  it was just a compliment of your comment . 
  i meant that it was well written , 
  nice write-up . 
  you 're making a lot of sense here but i think you 're overlooking a crucial aspect : the ( pro- ) russian side * already thinks * the ` nazi junta ' in ukraine is a puppet regime of the us installed by the us and their narrative is that the us is already engaged with boots on the ground , cia operatives and military hardware . 
  sure russia might react in the way you describe but there 's no way they could explain that reaction to the ( pro- ) russian people because nothing will have changed for their propaganda narrative if the us really does get involved in whatever way . 
  if the opposition already insists you 're doing something then what 's the harm in actually starting to do that thing ? 
  they 've kind of fucked themselves with their own propaganda and that might be an angle to use that against them ... 
  furthermore they 're still denying involvement and denouncing russian casualties . 
  as far as they 're concerned the russian military is not involved so they ca n't officially get hurt by the conflict . 
  anyway , that 's just my two cent addendum ... 
  us does n't have to be involved outside of supplying the javelins and training the missile specialists . 
  would be a very minor and cheap role compared to the role russia plays for the other side . 
  it would however mean that it becomes almost irrelevant how much armor russia sends across the border . 
  and if you look at how extremely effective javelins are . 
  could instantly turn the tide in the conflict . 
  / r/european is calling , they want their hyperbole back . 
   big german corporations are targeted and hurt by this . 
  russian and chinese cyber spying is hurt by this . 
  you understand that western intelligence agencies are protecting western interests right ? 
  for every incident like this with an actual spy tens of thousands of incidents occur because of digital breaches . 
  for the security of our corporations it 's incredibly important our own agencies have access . 
  ah thanks for the explanation . 
  makes sense !, 
  hey guys , quick question : how is this related to / r/europe ? 
  i get that russia can be geographically considered part of europe or whatever but then why is there an eu flag in the banner ? 
  is this sub about eu-europe or about a landmass ? 
  ca n't russia get their own subreddit ? 
  or can we change the banner ? 
  this always confuses the fuck out of me . 
  my thought was that when you get caught with a large amount of an illegal substance and cash money the assumption is that the two are related and both get confiscated . 
  not sure how the law and police guidelines work in norway though . 
  wait , i 'm confused . 
  why would he bring norwegian currency * into norway * ? 
   when cannabis is much worse for you .
