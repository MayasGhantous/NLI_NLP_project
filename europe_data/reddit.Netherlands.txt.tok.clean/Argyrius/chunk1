stupid satnav !, 
  exactly , the dutch merchants for example never used the prinsenvlag , but rather the hollandse vlag . 
  she got plenty of attention in the dutch media , all of a sudden she would pop up everywhere on the telly . 
  danish sounds so close in terms of pronunciation etc , but i can never understand any of it . 
  it feels like i forgot how to speak dutch, 
  * woah dude ... 
  i can smell colours ... *, 
  i kinda like heineken 's ads : [ no subtitles but speaks for itself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gb63dawjuo ) [ rudi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkmm7sokcuk ) [ world cup 2014 ] ( http://adland.tv/commercials/heineken-oranjekoorts-2014-105-netherlands ) ( this one is a bit crazy , could n't find a youtube version ), 
  sssshh , the 2010 world cup was totally cancelled . 
  nothing happened ... 
  it 's a long story , and no one is really sure , but i 'll try to give somewhat simple answer . 
  there was a flag with orange instead of red . 
  when the netherlands became independent there were two flags in use , the one was our current flag ( with a lighter blue ) and the other one with orange instead of red . 
  it is not really clear why , but at one point in the 17th century , the red-white-blue became favoured over the orange-white-blue . 
  later , when the orange-white-blue ( also called the prince 's flag , for the prince of orange , ancestor of our current royals ) became associated with the dutch nazi party before wwii , the red-white-blue was officially established as the sole dutch flag . 
  yes , the colour orange is associated with the king and the royals . 
  while the dutch flag is red-white-blue , the colour that * really * screams `` dutch '' is orange . 
  orange was symbolic for the prince of orange ( an ancestor of our royals ) , who was an important person in the [ 80 years war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eighty_years%27_war ) , when the netherlands became an independent country . 
  for example , most of our sports teams use it , like our [ football team ] ( http://www.omroepwest.nl/sites/default/files/imagecache/cp_main/erasmus/70/2583278.jpg ) . 
  every year the birthday of the monarch is celebrated with lots of beer , parties and nation-wide flea markets , among other things, 
  muh [ king 's day ] ( http://blog.habitatapartments.com/wp-content/upl/kings_day_amsterdam.jpeg ), 
  some men , quite literally , just want to watch the world burn arsons happen every summer in greece, 
   it 's really , really hard to not automatically downvote american posters this says more about you than about those american posters . 
  the fact that people still want punishment when unemployment is at 26 % , youth unemployment at 50 % and 17 % of greeks is unable to meet their daily food needs is shocking . 
  yes there are many things still wrong with the greek state , but you wo n't fix those by punishment . 
  what are you talking about , only syriza does populism / s, 
  no worries mate , i would n't have known it either if i had n't seen that reference pop up in other threads about the netherlands , 
  in case you did n't get the [ reference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj882qyzr-m ), 
  that 246 billion was never given out of goodwill , but out of fear for a spread of the crisis . 
  people love to shit on greece , and have loved to do so for the past 5 years . 
  they 'll take any chance to do it . 
  as far as i know these are not exit polls . 
  that 's important , because calling someone and asking them what they would vote is different than asking people who actually went to vote . 
  a no to the reddit union will mean an exit from the reddit union !, 
  vote yes on the referendum to ensure the stability and prosperity of / r/iama in the reddit union !, 
  vote yes and prevent the disaster of an / r/iamaxit !, 
  according to the council of europe a strawpoll does not conform to the european standards for referendums . 
  i propose google forms . 
  do n't you know ? 
  unless the suicide rate is the highest in the world and the wages are the lowest , greeks are not allowed to complain . 
  / s please people , these things are * not * a race to the bottom . 
  the fact that the suicide rate is not higher than in some other european countries does not make the huge increase in suicides any less worrying . 
  thanks for the translation , that was very interesting !, 
  if there 'd even be another rioter that is ... 
  i guess one could throw rocks at seagulls . 
  * inb4 peta *, 
  it would be interesting to see what a riot on an island like kastellorizo would look like . 
   also those polls are not on the loaded referendum on the eurogroup-proposal ( that does n't exist ) . 
  there 's a big difference . 
  that 's a good point , the polls were conducted between the 24th and the 26th , but these polls can nevertheless be interesting . 
  that 's cool . 
  people of all nations suffered and it would be an insult to all those who lost their homes or even lives to deny that . 
  akardas , i do n't see the big deal . 
  it would have been perfectly understandable if the muhacirs did name the cities after their home cities , but they did n't . 
  why does it bother you that some people did , even calling it dramatic ' ? 
  there is nothing ` dramatic ' about naming something after something that you love and have an attachment to . 
   we did n't call bursa new kyustendil or whatever to make it more dramatic though . 
  bursa ( \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1 ) is a millenia-old city though , of course they did n't name it after cities in the balkans , it already had a name since the 2nd-3rd century bc . 
  greeks did n't rename cities , no one renamed athens or larissa or patras , but they built new neighbourhoods and cities to accomodate the refugees , naming them after what those refugees felt was their true home . 
  there is no ` making it more dramatic ' about it , they had just been forced out of the places where their families had lived for centuries . 
  kazantzidis himself was born in in nea ionia , athens , which is a neighbourhood formed by greeks from turkey after the population exchange , but his parents were from alanya and urdu ( most people with a surname with the - idis suffix have pontic greek roots ) . 
  there are many neighbourhoods like that across greece , often called `` new ( ... ) '' , there are multiple neighbourhoods and cities called nea ionia ( new ionia , named after the region of ionia , present day izmir province ) and nea smyrni ( new smyrna or new izmir ) for example . 
  stratos dionisiou is another very famous greek singer born in greece to greeks from asia minor . 
  or france edit : im an idiot, 
  family issues ? 
   britain as the us of europe like son , like ... father ? 
  syriza mps are telling journalists on greek television that they 'll vote `` no '', 
   french low country [ not again , please ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_french_empire ), 
  welcome to most of the debates about greece, 
  i fell in love with rome when i went there . 
  you could be there for months seeing a new thing every day . 
  pssh it 's obviously li-ces-ter !, 
  rural and touristic are two different things of course . 
  an outsider will not really notice the crisis in places like santorini . 
  my greek family comes from a rural , non-touristic place in greece . 
  the crisis has hit there too , but one of the differences is that my grandmother grows her own tomatoes and stuff and therefore does n't have to buy all the food she eats , for example . 
  also , many people in the rural places own their houses so they do n't have to pay rent for example . 
  but still , my grandparents would n't be able to sustain themselves currently on their pensions , so we send them money from here when they need it . 
  just for fun i 'd like to see us putting fences [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/baarle-nassau_-_baarle-hertog-en.svg/2000px-baarle-nassau_-_baarle-hertog-en.svg.png ) for a day, 
  it 's the british expat pensioners in the south !, 
  i would love it if the netherlands would host something like that , but many of my countrymen seem to disagree, 
  not criticising you , but the nos and rtl7 are not 100 % reliable when it comes to stuff like this , trust me . 
  in the netherlands in my environment the norm is three kisses on the cheek , women kiss women and men kiss women , but never men and men . 
  it always catches me out when i go to my family in greece , where the norm is two . 
  after the first two i awkwardly wait for the third one , and then i realise it wo n't come . 
  it happens the other way around too , when i go back to the netherlands , and i stop at two while the other goes in for the third one . 
  in my greek family men kissing men on the cheek is more normal though , for me mostly older family members . 
  that 's really interesting , that 's the first time that i hear another language use nederland ( except for afrikaans , which does n't really count ) , which is actually the dutch name, 
  i remember when i had to register in greece for something when i got my driver 's license there , and i told them i was born in \u039f\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 . 
  when they gave me the confirmation of the registration i looked at my birthplace and i was surprised to read \u039f\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 ( dutch antilles ) . 
  i went back , asked them about it , and they told me that they could n't find \u039f\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 in the system , and they assumed that \u039f\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 would be ok . 
  they had completely forgotten about \u039a\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9 \u03a7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 ... 
  he 's only one of many , but he is the most famous one . 
  get the champagne out guys !, 
  not just change , they said that they are thinking about the possibility of leaving together with other fas, 
   i will take it upon myself and i want to fix fifa together with you sure you will ... 
  blatter is just a symptom of a much bigger problem . 
  the uefa , which is supporting prince ali is just as bad . 
  platini was one of the people supporting the qatarese world cup bid , his son is now the ceo of a company in qatar . 
  it 's better this way , as you say , this will keep the pressure on .
