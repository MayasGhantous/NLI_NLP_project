  whoa , til, 
  serbia really is abnormally good . 
  i love me some indycar , i always catch those races when i 'm able to . 
  the combination of street circuits , permanent circuits and ovals is nice , good bit of variation . 
  i also like to watch basketball ocassionally , but rarely nba . 
  mostly european basketball because of airing times and coverage . 
  i do n't care about the superbowl . 
  yeah a lot of the time the weather that you guys have comes to the netherlands as well after a day orso , that 's what i noticed when i lived in england for a bit . 
  we get slightly more rain here but our weather is very similar to the south-east of england . 
  average high for february in amsterdam is 6.3 , so it 's not typical , but it can happen sometimes . 
  it 's not too bad . 
  you swedes are probably tired of all the snow but i would love to have some right now ... 
  mild weather today . 
  11.6 degrees celsius and overcast . 
  we had some weeks of frost in january but hardly any snow , i think all in all i 've seen 1cm of snow this winter here where i live ( near amsterdam ) . 
  i 'd love to have some more snow . 
  i support this initiative, 
  lars ' sister ? 
  i think many schools do n't teach it . 
  i think i personally learnt it once in kindergarten . 
   do people think of him as danish ? 
  should n't we ? 
  i think i remember reading somewhere that about half of dutch people do n't know the anthem . 
  many of those who do know it probably learnt it for a football match of oranje , 
  not really , we do have our own [ bible belt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bible_belt_ ( netherlands \\ ) ) , but we do n't have anything like the amish, 
   in the netherlands , i 've not experienced that many fellow anime/manga fans . 
  me neither , i knew no one in my high school that liked it so i had n't had any experience with it myself ( and therefore did n't know what to think about it ) until i got into university . 
  there 's somewhat of a small stigma around it i think , but it 's not like you 'll immediately be a social outcast if you say that you like it . 
  a little bit worse than if you 'd be into marvel comics etc. 
  anime and manga are n't as popular anyway as in some other countries so many people wo n't have any experiences with the medium and wo n't know how to judge it . 
  generally you 'll only encounter the classic weeb stereotype here if you attend conventions . 
  oh and sometimes you encounter them at festivals of the local japanese community that otherwise have nothing to do with otaku culture . 
  that 's exactly what i 'm thinking the vvd ( our right-wing party ) may do . 
  they 're taking the moral high-ground right now , telling people to just ` be normal ' . 
  they 're also saying that the chance they 'd govern together with the pvv is 0.0 % . 
  when the elections are done though i can totally see them go `` we 're forming a coalition with the pvv for the political stability of this country '' , citing the heavily divided political landscape as a reason . 
  there have n't really been major fluctuations in the polls since trump was sworn in , but it 'll be a talking point in the upcoming campaigns for sure . 
  i do think that events like brexit and trump will motivate more people to vote , both voters who support and oppose the recent developments in world politics . 
  if he does n't manage to form a coalition government ( something that right now is looking difficult , but who knows what parties will do after election campaigning is over ) , then indeed as you say , he wo n't be prime minister . 
  might wan na try / r/travel, 
   i ca n't actually ride a bike i 'm afraid that , in accordance with article 57 . b of the cultural conformity law , i 'll have to take away your dutch nationality . 
  there is no specific law in the netherlands that makes burning flags illegal . 
  however , you ca n't just go outside and start a fire or burn anything you like so in that sense it could be as illegal as burning any other random object . 
  too bad you hardly see any subarus here anymore . 
  they just do n't fit the dutch market , which is a shame . 
  a blue subaru impreza is still my guilty pleasure car . 
  i often hear americans on reddit complain about subaru reliability though . 
  ah , i think that 's a good choice then , yeah !, 
  i was gon na suggest looking at the erasmus university too as it 's right up there with the uva for economics , but judging from your other comment you already did that , 
  i think that 's belgium ( would also explain the white number plates on the cars ) , looks like brugge, 
  what subject area are you looking at ? 
  a few examples : for stuff like engineering the tu delft is amazing , for humanities there 's the university of amsterdam ( uva ) , for business studies there 's the erasmus university of rotterdam . 
  all of these have plenty of programmes in english . 
   people might talk about social democracy as far left but it 's not . 
  that 's just left if centre left . 
  not to mention many social democrat parties in europe are nowhere near left-wing anymore, 
   but greece has always been hostile to any name that includes ` macedonia ' . 
  not true , even your own link says that in 2002 greece was on the brink of a deal for ` upper macedonia ' , but then the tetovo crisis happened . 
  people often forget the irredentism part, 
  i think one of the first things you 'll have to look at is language . 
  for example , in the netherlands there is a wide variety of programmes taught in english , but there are countries where this is n't as common . 
   that tries to hide the palace of culture too bad that it 's so disliked , the palace of culture was one of my favourite buildings in warsaw when i visited, 
  most shitposts here are just lazy , they do n't even make an effort . 
  yeah , it 's not that bad in real life . 
  i still do n't like it ( but i prefer traditional architecture anyway ) but it 's not * that * bad . 
  i do like the shard though , it looks sci-fi and evil . 
  wow that 's incredibly similar, 
  hmmm that 's a difficult one . 
  the ` hate ' against the germans in sports started after wwii , so it was not a hate against individual regions , but rather against the country as a whole . 
  if there was a team in western-germany then maybe that team would be disliked a bit less , as that region has most in common with us and there 's a lot of interaction across the border . 
  i guess maybe munich would be bigger rivals , amsterdam has a bit of a history with munich in terms of football . 
  bayern munich famously spoiled johan cruijff 's ( the best player the netherlands ever had ) friendly goodbye-match with ajax amsterdam by beating ajax 0-8 . 
  this feeling may not be present with the rest of the country , but in amsterdam this hurt a lot . 
  yeah as / u/non-rhetorical said i had no knowledge whatsoever of ice hockey ( the sports i follow are mainly football and f1 ) , but as a sports fan this was fun to do nonetheless , just a bit of casual fantasising , 
  i have no knowledge whatsoever of the sport , i do n't know any team apart from maybe the maple leafs , that said , i 'll have a go , should be fun . 
  the team will be based in amsterdam , cause it 's the capital and in a region where a huge part of the dutch population lives ( the [ randstad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/randstad ) ) . 
  the amsterdam-based team will not be representative of just amsterdam , but rather draw in fans from the whole country , as the netherlands does n't seem big enough or good enough in terms of talent to host two big teams . 
  ** team name ** : amsterdam lions ** business : ** as said , amsterdam is located in the randstad , one of the largest metropolitan areas in europe . 
  the population in this area is mostly wealthy for dutch terms , and amsterdam is probably the most expensive dutch city to live in . 
  amsterdam is a big business centre , with a lot of headquarters of big global companies like ing , heineken , kpmg , randstad and many more ( with huge companies like shell and philips elsewhere in the netherlands , if the lions were to represent the whole country ) . 
  should be enough money to support the team if the league can generate interest . 
  ** competitiveness : ** i do n't know about local talent , but the dutch national team is apparently 24th in the world . 
  it will use dutch talent combined with players from the teams of more established leagues like the nhl , much like how european basketball teams fill the gaps in their teams with players from nba and ncaa players . 
  ** potential rivals ** : anyone german ( they are our main rivals in sports , to the point where edgy youths chant about them even at events unrelated to sports ) , or a potential other dutch team if they 're in the league , bonus points if they 're from rotterdam ** aesthetic ** : orange and white colours that represent the whole of the netherlands , a logo along the lines of the [ national dutch football team logo ] ( http://antibarbari.nl/wp-content/uploads/nl-elftal.jpg ) . 
  ** home stadium ** : maybe the jaap edenhal , the stadium which currently hosts the amsterdam-based hockey-team amstel tijgers . 
  currently 4500 seats , could be expanded if the league is successful and popular . 
  another option if the sport gets radically more popular is to move to the [ ziggo dome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ziggo_dome ) , a 17,000-seat indoor concert hall that has already hosted ice hockey matches . 
  [ here 's an overview of recent polls ] ( http://frontbencher.nl/peilingen/ ), 
  that 's currently impossible . 
  referenda can only be held about newly adopted laws and newly signed treaties . 
  referenda are also not binding , and the constitution would have to be changed to allow for binding referenda , and changing the constitution requires a 2/3 vote in favour in parliament . 
  i absolutely love both of those, 
   i personally always use english because it makes googling for help much easier , and also because to translate some terms , you have to use ridiculous neologisms . 
  exactly the same for me , having to google and troubleshoot with the dutch terms is a pain in the ass . 
  it 's unfair really, 
  very big , both the summer and winter olympics . 
  the olympics are always shown on the public broadcasting tv channels and they setup an extensive online streaming platform so people can see all events happening . 
  there are a lot of people who hardly watch any sports but will always watch the olympics . 
  automatics are getting more and more popular here , in part due to the popularity of hybrids etc. 
  the norm here is still a manual transmission ( most models are cheaper with a manual ) , but i 've never really encountered the negative stigma here myself that i hear from other countries , unless you count the occasional boy racers who have watched too many fast and furious movies .
