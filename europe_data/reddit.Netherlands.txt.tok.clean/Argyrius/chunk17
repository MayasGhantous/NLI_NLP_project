  they start at a later age , and they do n't go through the same process in their youth where they 're often exposed to the language they 're learning . 
  now , i ca n't say how it was for other people , but personally i was raised bilingually with dutch and greek ( i got that one for ` free ' because one of my parents is greek ) . 
  combine that with english and i kinda had a trilingual youth . 
  early on this gave me a better understanding of how languages worked . 
  you compare the languages you know and start to understand the general structure of a language better , which helps a lot when you 're learning the grammar of any language . 
  it still takes a lot of effort of course to learn a new language , so then it becomes about how dedicated and interested you are . 
  i 've been in the process of learning japanese for quite some time now , but i 've found it difficult to motivate myself to start learning the grammar rules and all the different characters ( there are fucking 1000s of them ) . 
  so then i tried to go the route of watching tv shows , so i ended up watching anime . 
  this has helped me learn some conversational japanese , and i try to complement that with learning grammar . 
  i 've also had spanish , german and french in school , but because those did n't interest me as much i only still know some basic stuff ( except for spanish i guess , which i really liked and therefore learned rather quickly ) . 
  happens here as well . 
  when it happens consumers should report it and the company can get fined , but the companies know that the consumers wo n't bother anyway . 
  they 're not non-existant , but in politics they 're more common than in media . 
  for example , [ geert wilders ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iesg8giuc0m ) has a regional accent , and [ emile roemer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okz11sq10fi ) , the leader of the socialist party has a regional accent . 
  that said , it 's widely known that people who try to be successful in media , musicals , tv shows , etc , often make an effort to try and learn `` general dutch '' . 
  it 's a bit rare to hear someone on television with a heavy regional accent . 
  they are very favourable in terms of taxes , but i personally do n't know how they are in terms of other regulations , for example relating to employment relationship , etc. 
  edit : i got curious so i went and looked up some indeces that would answer op 's question . 
  the [ index of economic freedom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index_of_economic_freedom ) is one such index . 
  under ` method ' you can see on what factors the index is based , and in my opinion those factors are close to what we 're looking for . 
  the european countries that score the highest on that particular index are , in order , switzerland , ireland , estonia and the united kingdom . 
  really ? 
  where are you from ? 
  i 've never heard dutch people use the english version among themselves . 
  steen-papier-schaar was extremely normal here ( amsterdam metropolitan area ) and i knew it as a kid far before i even spoke a word of english . 
  the uk is one of the most ` laissez-faire ' countries in europe , along with switzerland . 
  its laws also tend to be more employer and investor friendly than other european countries . 
   do you mean toilets rather than places you have a bath ? 
  is n't it common in american english to euphemistically refer to them as bathrooms , even though they do n't have a bath ? 
  steen-papier-schaar , so rock-paper-scissors , 
   but a ) got cut off lol woops i did n't even notice it, 
  nothing surprises me with the vvd, 
   netherlands : https://youtu.be/irfluamkooy the dutch accent in that one is unusally good ( it does sound a bit new yorker though at times ) . 
  the only other person i 've heard do it well is [ bill bailey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu9crxty5lk ) . 
  often people just make it sound like sean connery on steroids or german . 
  there are a lot of parties that have made it clear that he 's so opposed to their political views that they do n't want to work with him . 
  that said , the second-biggest party in the polls has already [ worked with him ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_rutte_cabinet ) in a so-called minority coalition , where he was n't part of the actual coalition ( and thus did n't provide ministers ) , but wilders ' party did support government get the majority . 
  so all-in-all , there is indeed a chance that , should he win , he would still not be in government , but it 's far from certain . 
  the dutch are notorious for driving slowly on the highways in belgium , france and germany with caravans , as portable movable homes . 
  if his party won he gets the first opportunity to form a majority government with other parties ( coalition ) . 
  in that coalition he would become the prime minister . 
  there is a chance that he will not be able to form a government with a majority in the house of parliament , due to other parties not wanting to work with him . 
  then the opportunity would be given to the party who came second in the elections , and then wilders could be left out and have no power . 
  currently there are 11 parties in the house of representatives ( edit : just gon na give the link like this cause reddit does n't like urls with ) at the end https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_representatives_ ( netherlands ) ) , and there are an additional 8 ` independent ' members of parliament , who somewhere after the elections split off from the political party they were elected with . 
  i think there are currently something like 19 parties running in the elections next year, 
  definitely belgium , and they joke about us for example , the [ match thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/5c386j/match_thread_netherlands_vs_belgium_friendlies/ ) over on / r/soccer for the friendly match between the netherlands and belgium was basically just belgians and dutchmen collecting jokes about each other , and it was glorious . 
  ( google translate may be helpful , and a lot of jokes are puns ), 
  to me portuguese from portugal always sounds more monotone and less expressive ( even a bit mumbly sometimes ) than brazilian portuguese , brazilian sounds more melodic , pronounced and clear . 
  not sure which is the most hated one , a lot of it depends on where you 're from and what you 're used to yourself . 
  that said , the accents that i 've heard people hate on a lot are : - [ limburgian accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrektvxj6_c ) - [ twente accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giwh9mb8nf4 ) - [ amsterdam accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swmgqddx31o ) ( the interviewer has a more ` neutral ' accent , gives some context ), 
  it 's more that the colonies were already well established before the various rules of football/rugby were starting to be introduced . 
  that 's why almost every anglo-saxon country ended up with its own variation on football/rugby . 
  american football in the usa , australian football in australia , association football ( ` socccer ' ) and rugby in the uk . 
  in each country the rudimentary form of a ballgame on a pitch evolved into a different game with different rulesets . 
  by the time association football rules were introduced in the uk the various colonies had already established their own forms of the sport and thus there was no interest in it . 
  i used to play for my local amateur club until i was 17 , as a winger and striker , stopped for school stuff . 
  nowadays i 'm a member of the official ajax amsterdam fanclub , which is also my local pro club , but i never had anywhere near the talent to be able to play for them . 
  i 've played against their youth teams sometimes at small tournaments . 
  in 20 minute matches they would annihilate us 12-0 . 
  not at all , it 's pretty much seen as just a little bit more ` exciting ' job these days . 
  that said there is a lot of respect for wwii veterans etc. 
  as you asked especially for high schoolers , in my high school the people who did drugs talked about it very openly . 
  there were n't a lot of people who regularly did weed , pills like mdma and xtc as a party drug at hardstyle and other edm festivals were more common . 
  it was popular within certain subgroups of the school , but generally not widespread . 
  attitudes to people using them varied . 
  many people could n't care less , other people thought it was sad that their friends could n't enjoy parties without popping pills , etc. 
  as for how common talking about them is in youth culture in general , we have actual [ tv programmes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spuiten_en_slikken ) on the public broadcasting tv channels dedicated to all types of different drugs . 
  in the split between ( only ) north and south which op mentioned the uk is totally northern europe . 
  metallica 's latest album . 
  particularly [ spit out the bone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m46z0-hxyso ) and [ halo on fire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbxh5s9_a3m ) ( really love the long outro on that one ) . 
  i 've also been getting into retro wave more and more . 
  if i look at the cars in my street , like 4 out of 10 cars are volkswagen golfs . 
  it 's generally just hatchbacks everywhere . 
  new cars are expensive as fuck here because of emissions taxes , and the netherlands does n't really have many exciting roads to reward you for buying a fun car ( no mountains , straight and well-surfaced roads everywhere , speed traps galore ) , so people just buy economical and affordable cars . 
  the stereotypical businessman car around here seems to be the bmw 3 series . 
  yes , but i believe the uk is more laissez-faire-oriented in other aspects of business than ireland, 
  ... do they ? 
  not really though , english and german ( and dutch , danish etc etc ) share a common ancestor , but english is not derived from german, 
  by doing that it would probably achieve the exact opposite of the populist wave passing . 
  populism already thrives on the feeling of ` us vs the establishment ' . 
  it would get much worse if the establishment would actively start to battle them in that way . 
  close to macdonald 's , stereotypical dutch pronunciation would be ` meckdonnolds ' , or just slang maccie, 
   these are often called `` plastic paddies '' in ireland does n't plastic paddies refer primarily to the people who are many generations removed from their irish ancestors and mistake stereotypes for real irish customs ? 
  like the people that go `` i can drink a lot cause i 'm irish '' . 
  oh my god , it was meant to be !, 
  never watched hetalia so i was curious to see how we 're personified there  initially , netherlands was said to be a strong strategist and ** world-dominating type of man who likes very young women and thinks nothing of using some types of shady drugs ** oh dear ... 
  also downvoting someone who is in discussion with you does n't make your case somehow stronger . 
  edit : and you do it again , hah . 
   2 days since an attack in amsterdam . 
  let 's be honest here , as terrible and reprehensible as it is , you ca n't compare a salafist beating up an old mouaddin with the major terrorist attacks op is talking about . 
   aua the extra - a in german after au always makes me giggle, 
   because there are no hills in denmark we 're flat too . 
  flat is justice !, 
  apart from the southern part of limburg , not at all, 
  funnily enough , the only place i know called ashford was a beautiful town in guild wars, 
  in my experience it 's usually weed questions or johan cruijff and stroopwafels praise, 
  it 's the danish version with the potato in the mouth , 
  dutch / s, 
  unless you 're the generic self-insert male main character , in which case you must have the most generic black/brown hair ever, 
  pepsi usually comes in 1.5 l bottles here , and they cost around $ 1.50 ( excluding discounts ) .
