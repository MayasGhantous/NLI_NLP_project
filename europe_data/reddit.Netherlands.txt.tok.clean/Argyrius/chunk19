  but if your dad is cypriot instead of greek then it may be different , i 'm not familiar with cypriot conscription laws . 
  to my knowledge you can apply for a permanent postponement of your military service as long as you work and live outside of greece . 
  also , no greek goes to military service for two years . 
  it 's 9 months currently . 
   otorhinolaryngologists this word makes sense considering its greek roots , but at first it looks like someone just went dklsafhasjkdfh all over their keyboard :'), 
  i 've had that experience when i heard romanian in a noisy environment . 
  normally i can recognise romanian without having the association of `` ah that sounds like italian '' , but when i heard it during a football match and i could n't quite make out what they were saying it sounded like italian with a slavic accent . 
  [ op escaping ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e1/09/7a/e1097a3a9ab8bcc146185546ea77a935.jpg ), 
  i 'd like to know what you 're smoking, 
  just something that quickly came to mind , but if it truly bothers you and a lot of other people then maybe something like a ` common question ' ( edit : or maybe a different name , something that does n't discourage posters ) flair would be a solution ? 
  that way mods or posters can mark their question as such and then people who are tired of seeing those questions can filter them out with stuff like res . 
  that way people with the common questions still get the answers , and more importantly the interactivity that they want , while it wo n't bother the ` veterans ' of this subreddit who have seen them many times . 
  i do n't know , just something that quickly sprang to mind , but i really do n't think faqs are the solution though . 
  yeah this was what i was trying to say , but you worded it so much clearer and better than i did . 
  interactivity is the perfect word . 
  the feeling that there are people all over the world ( or in our case mostly europe ) reading and answering your question * right now * . 
  an faq would take that away . 
  i do n't think i 'd be a fan of an faq , subreddits like this one and / r/askreddit repeat themselves all the time . 
  it 's how they keep living . 
  hell , reddit repeats itself all the time . 
  there are only so many things people can ask a group of people they do n't know , and common concerns are commonly asked also , you get different answers everytime you ask the same question , reflecting the differences in time , different users in the sub at that time , etc. 
  there will always be new and different answers to the same questions , even if those questions are super common . 
  if you introduce an faq you kind of get a be-all-end-all thread of answers , which i do n't think is desirable . 
  edit : in the end a lot of the questions are about creating a discussion with a group of people . 
  an faq would kinda be like just looking something up on google . 
  as you said , a lot of the time companies will prefer someone who speaks the native language , all else being equal . 
  this depends on the company and their language of communication . 
  that is not something unique to having dual citizenship of course . 
  apart from that , no , if you are an eu citizen then it does n't really matter what your other nationality is , and there are n't any disadvantages other than the obvious stuff like language . 
  i 'm neither a chemical engineer nor an economist , but from what i know the job prospects for both chemical engineering and economics are really good here . 
  eurovision-participant australia is extremely close culturally , but i would n't call them european, 
  you probably ca n't because , at least for the foreseeable future , you 're still an eu citizen and thus you do n't need one . 
  also , no one knows on what terms brexit will happen , so no one has an idea of how immigration will work between eu countries and the uk . 
  by doing that you will only further alienate the frustrated voters that brought him in power . 
  like him or not , he is the guy who through democratic process was elected by the american people , and so we will have to deal with it and hope for the best . 
  the only thing we can do is to cooperate with him like we would with any other american president , and hope that he does well , for the sake of the american people and the world 's economy . 
  with all due respect , to be calling for sanctions and not recognizing him when he is n't even in office yet is ridiculous . 
  do n't feed the troll , people, 
   anyone know if there 's as much focus on international elections in the usa ? 
  never , multiple talkshows here were talking about the us elections almost everyday . 
  yesterday it was literally the only thing dutch television talked about . 
  there is no way that there is the same interest in foreign politics in the usa . 
  the `` how have we come to this '' feeling for me was more that we see this happening everywhere , ukip in the uk , le pen in france , wilders here , and that with dutch elections coming in four months , i can see something similar happening here too . 
  it 's not an american phenomenon , and it did n't make an impact on me just because it was the usa , but rather it was a symptom of a bigger thing . 
  with brexit i had more of an emotional impact as if i was a brit myself , because i 've lived in the uk for a short time . 
  basically you could see it as a variation of an fptp system . 
  to put it simply , there are about 538 electoral votes distributed among the different states , and how many votes a single state gets roughly scales with the population size . 
  for example , california has 55 votes while wyoming has 3 . 
  win in a state , and you get all of the electoral votes that state has . 
  so if you win in california ( no matter what margin ) you get 55 votes . 
  the only exceptions to this ` the winner takes it all ' system are maine and nebraska i think . 
  this is why it was so important for the candidates to win a state like florida , it has a lot of electoral votes while it is not a stronghold of either party , so it is a so-called ` swing-state ' . 
  the candidates do a lot of campaigning in these swing-states , and they focus less on the states they are sure to win . 
  interesting , i never thought of it that way . 
  i was familiar with the system since the first obama election ( the first us election i really paid attention to ) . 
  coming from a country with a proportional representation myself , the results the uk and the us systems produce seem weird and undemocratic to me . 
  imo they are a big cause of ` frustration ' - parties like ukip being so popular . 
  is n't this just a dutch and french thing ? 
  i think it 's just one of those things that happens between neighbours , it 's more of a comical stereotype rather than a real one . 
  well , first off it depends on * where * in europe you 're going . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but it 's not possible for same-sex foreign couples to marry here in the netherlands . 
  there were some calls in the dutch house of representatives to allow it , but the government does n't want to allow it because of the practical and juridical complications it brings . 
   it 's just movies , you guys , it 's not real . 
  but something not being true = / = not understanding why it 's associated with a country in particular . 
  there are a lot of ... * research * materials from the czech republic for example , for my country a stereotype is is that we 're all potheads , and i totally get why it 's associated with us ( amsterdam n stuff ) , but in reality we consume less weed than most of the rest of the western world . 
  choosing between those two is like choosing between typhus and the plague, 
  you know what , i 'm not even surprised . 
  and , honestly , while i do n't agree with the eo 's view on evolution and a lot of other stuff in the world , i can kinda respect the decision to make that part of the documentary ambiguous . 
  they need to satisfy and adapt their target demographic and members somehow , and this way it 's at least not done by putting a 100 % creationist standpoint in there , rather it leaves room for all theories . 
  do they ? 
  that 's funny and sad at the same time ... 
  spoken like a true brit, 
  i never listen to radio so i could be wrong , but does n't 3fm play the occasional christmas song all year round ? 
   cause for people ** in ** schengen i said that in my comment, 
  ** tv : ** npo ( dutch public broadcasting company ) : made up of different individual broadcasters , originating from the times of dutch [ pillarisation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pillarisation ) . 
  some examples of these are ( there are many more than these ) : - vara : originally socialist , used to have heavy ties to the labour party , still retains some left-wing bias . 
  mostly talk shows , quizzes and some investigative reporting on consumer issues . 
  - nos : special broadcaster with a statutory obligation to focus on news coverage . 
  responsible for news coverage and sports . 
  - kro : originally catholic , mirroring its catholic target demographic it has lost most of its focus on religion . 
  - eo : evangelical ( protestant ) , probably the only religious broadcaster to have retained its heavy religious focus . 
  programmes are about god , jesus , god , god , jesus and god . 
  oh , and sometimes they borrow bbc 's nature documentaries , which are awesome . 
  rtl : commercial broadcaster . 
  dutch division of the huge european tv company based in luxembourg . 
  sbs : dutch commercial broadcaster . 
  honestly , i 'd love to give you a target demographic for both rtl and sbs , but i ca n't get you any better than `` targets general tv audience '' . 
  sbs is maaaaybe a little more focused on trying to get in the youth . 
  they both have so many channels that each focus on individual types of consumers ( mostly men vs women , old vs young , etc. 
  ** newspapers : ** de telegraaf : big bold titles , tabloid , newspaper version of clickbait , originally from amsterdam . 
  considered right-wing but imo mostly just populist . 
  credit where credit is due , their sports office is * very * good , non-tabloidy , accurate , and might as well be a different company . 
  ad : same as telegraaf , tabloid , but originally from rotterdam volkskrant : centre-left , used to be catholic . 
  nrc handelsblad : liberal , has a youth version called nrc next trouw : protestant , started by the protestant restistance during wwii this is just a small part of the dutch media , but the comment was getting huge already . 
  have n't even mentioned stuff like radio and internet . 
  completely open borders for who ? 
  everyone in the world ? 
  cause for people in schengen they already are edit : if you mean for everyone in the world , then probably very few people, 
  you can say about the interior of a room `` this is gezellig '' and that would n't necessarily imply that the gezellig is a social thing , rather it gives you a cozy warm feeling . 
  yeah geselligkeit looks close but it 's something different .
