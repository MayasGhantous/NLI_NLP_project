  the summers are mild and the winters are too , and everything in between is just wet and dreary . 
  it rarely snows in winter and it 's very rare to have temperatures over 30 in summer , average highs are about 22 degrees . 
  i could do with some more extremes . 
  some more snow in the winters , a bit more sun and heat in the summer , rather than just 10 months of autumn ... 
  this is the only correct answer, 
  ahhh that 's interesting , la hague/the hague sounds like a disaster for sat nav systems :'), 
   la haye is that the hague/den haag ? 
   op was asking especially for americans , i personally doubt most americans know those things ... except for maaaaybe the colonial past cause new york etc were dutch colonies, 
  italy is the # 4 economy in the eu , # 3 when the uk leaves . 
  for a lot of western europe trade with italy is more important than trade with russia ( and the few eastern european countries that speak some of it ) . 
  bwoah , we 're used to these comments ... :') it 's interesting though cause we are n't the only ones with strong / x / sounds , so there must be more to dutch sounding rough than just the / x /, 
  yuri is hugely talented , but i would n't put him on the same level as the others , he has n't achieved as much ( largely because of his suspension for cocaine use ) , nor do i think that he 's as famous as some of the others , except for maybe ard schenk, 
  oh yeah definitely , the countries are very similar ( we do n't understand a thing of each other 's languages though ) . 
  but most people do n't know enough about us to know that we 're similar , for them it 's mostly cause dutch/danish/denmark sounds like the same thing , and that they 're similarly placed on the map ( bordering the sea , next to germany ) oh , and stroopwafels  fish :d, 
  idk , a 5 maybe ( what would you say ? ) ? 
  people know who we are but that 's about it . 
  some people think we are literally sodom & gomorrah ( what with the gay pride , drugs , prostitution and euthanasia and all ) . 
  other people think we 're the same thing as denmark . 
  i suppose our sports teams ( particularly football ) are reasonably famous worldwide , for the size of our country . 
   alex zanardi - paracyclist and also formula 1 driver and 2x cart champion , 
  there is a small community of preppers in the netherlands . 
  they do the standard stuff , build shelters , collect canned food , power supplies , etc. 
  guns are very hard to get here so the preppers and survivalists who want to collect weapons mostly collect stuff like crossbows and air rifles . 
   better than learning all 15 couplets from the wilhelmus . 
  nah mate we do that for fun, 
  not by heart , no , we would pretty much always have the texts at hand and the questions would be about deeper meanings etc. 
  no parroting . 
  thankfully i never had to learn anything by heart . 
  i needed to understand literature texts and be able to explain it when asked , but no learning by heart . 
  sure , whatever you say . 
  certain places in the us are better than places in europe , and certain european countries are better than places in the us . 
  adding to those : - [ pieter van den hoogenband ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pieter_van_den_hoogenband ) ( triple olympic champion 2000 , 2004 - 100m ( 2x ) and 200m freestyle , swimming ) - [ inge de bruijn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inge_de_bruijn ) ( quadruple olympic champion 2000 , 2004 - 50m ( 2x ) and 100m freestyle , and 100m butterfly ) - [ ard schenk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ard_schenk ) ( triple olympic champion 1972 - speed skating ), 
  currently i 'm playing stellaris . 
  i love the atmosphere , it 's hugely time consuming though and i 'm a total noob . 
  the game i played the most over the last weeks is rfactor , a racing sim . 
  i 'm a big motorsport fan and i 'm trying to learn to race in sims myself . 
  just a suggestion for your survey . 
  you should n't make all the questions mandatory for people who answer that they have never used a dating app , cause the data they give is useless as they have n't got any experience with dating apps . 
  yeah pretty easily , stand in front of the two renaults and look through the windshield . 
  the steering wheels are on the opposite side, 
  man , that 's depressing . 
  like , not that it 's not livable or anything , but with the standard of living and wealth in the uk you 'd think that places like this would be cleaned up, 
  if someone asked me to guess where that is i * never * would have guessed the uk . 
  ... unless i noticed the steering wheel being on the bloody wrong side you crazy brits !, 
  my question to you is , as a tourist what do you do in a country you do n't know ? 
  a lot of people do n't know the local laws , local customs and local traffic situations , and so they 're cautious and they just stick to the ` rules ' . 
  australia or new zealand probably . 
  they are the most similar to us in terms of culture and politics while also having a nice climate and insanely beautiful nature . 
  if i 'd instantly learn the language i 'd probably pick japan instead . 
  it 's much easier to live there if you know the language . 
  beautiful country , a lot of history , and also very modern , a lot of beautiful nature and a very strong industry . 
  climate ranges from snowy cold in the north to very warm on okinawa . 
  the only thing that i 'd be hesitant about is the work culture . 
   netherlands -- indiana/utah so we get the indy 500 ? 
   i have heard about how the netherlands fared during ww2 , but it 's supposed to have an insane nightlife from what i heard did you mean rotterdam ? 
   but to be honest , all three cities you mentioned have insane nightlife . 
  amsterdam is much more touristy and crowded than the other cities , but in terms of beauty and stuff to see it 's at least as good . 
  rotterdam is also the odd one out here , cause it has much more modern architecture ( it was bombed to the ground in wwii ) . 
  if you 're into that kind of thing then rotterdam is an awesome city to visit , i personally like traditional architecture better . 
  really well / natively : dutch , greek , english reasonably okay : spanish enough to survive when in dire straits : italian , german , french learning : japanese, 
  first i wan na tell you that this is probably one of the more interesting questions we 've had recently on this subreddit . 
  other than that , i like reading your reasons for the comparisons between the different countries and states , and i 'd love to give you an answer myself , but i sadly do not know enough about the smaller states of the usa to give you a good answer ... 
  close but not quite , wider amsterdam metropolitan area, 
  straight line distance of about 85km to both belgium and germany , that 's very far for the netherlands, 
  it 's the one direction generation . 
  you can clearly see the spike when one direction got popular [ here ] ( http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/naam/is/liam ) . 
  before that the name was almost non-existent , and suddenly it grew to the # 1 name for newborn babies, 
  that 's amazing, 
  at least the italians are happy to put up with my broken attempted italian in my experience, 
  there are classics like bram ( abraham ) , noah , david and daniel which have been common for a long time , but there are also names like boaz , nathan , seth and jonah . 
  there 's a list with hebrew names in the netherlands [ here ] ( http://www.babybytes.nl/namen/hebreeuwse-jongensnamen ) in the brackets it says how many babies have been born with those names since 2006 . 
  this comment section looks like / r/askthenetherlands or something, 
  i wish i 'd lose pounds as fast as the uk after brexit ... ... yeah i got nothing, 
  haha well your american english is surely better than mine , i 've just got some experience with british slang . 
  at least your only language is the most useful language in the world , so you 've got that going for you !, 
  :d my native languages are dutch and greek ( i 've got one dutch parent and one greek parent ) , so i guess that makes english my third language . 
  i 'm not a brit either , so bear with me , but if i remember correctly from my time in the uk it basically says : when you 're out with the boys , and you 're looking at a jd sports store ( sports apparel etc ) , and you 're considering to have the curry club sandwich at whetherspoons ( common pub chain ) , but then your friend callum , who 's an absolute legend and very good at banter , says `` hey bros , let 's have a nando 's instead '' and you 're like `` awesome , let 's do it '' . 
  cheeky is positive in a mischievous , kinda way , although because english is n't my first language i do n't really know a synonym, 
  it 's a south african chicken restaurant chain very commonly found in the uk . 
  it was pretty decent ( nothing special imo ) in my experience , and a ` cheeky nando 's ' has become a bit of a meme with things like this :  when you 're out with the lads and you 're having a look in jd and you might fancy the curry club at ` spoons but then your mate callum who 's an absolute ledge and the archbishop of banterbury says `` oi brevs let 's have a cheeky nandos instead '' and you 'll think `` top . 
  let 's smash it . '', 
  that quote probably makes zero sense unless you 're a brit or you 've lived there, 
  telling them that there 's a nando 's opening on the other side of town is rumoured to have been successful in the past , but they often do not understand human language, 
  like english `` ya-ree '' . 
  mika ( pronounced like meeka ) is even more popular than jari but they 're generally younger than me , cause hakkinen 's prime was about 5 years later than litmanen , so i do n't really know many of them, 
  in the netherlands people mostly like simple and short names . 
  english , finnish , hebrew , it does n't really matter where they 're from , as long as it sounds good . 
  trend names are also common . 
  for example , in my generation there quite a few people named jari , which is a very un-dutch name , which became popular because of finnish football player jari litmanen , who played for ajax amsterdam . 
  the most popular names until now in 2016 : ** boys : ** daan , noah , sem , lucas , jesse , finn , milan , max , levi , bram , luuk ** girls : ** anna , julia , tess , sophie , emma , sara , mila , evi , zo\u00eb , eva edit : i 've noticed that the one direction trend seems to have died out , liam was number 1 for boys last year , and now it 's not even in the top 10, 
   i also do n't think the eu really likes canada at the moment i 'd say that for the general population it 's mostly about not liking shady isds rules in the trade deals the eu is negotiating . 
  that 's just my impression though , i have n't followed the negotiations closely . 
  i 'm not danish , but i assume that it is somewhat similar to the situation here in the netherlands . 
  if you truly want to integrate in the dutch population ( and not be an eternal expat ) and have equal chances with dutch people on the job market then learning dutch is important . 
  however , it is not a necessity and you 'll be able to survive here all of your life without really needing dutch . 
  arabia is not in africa, 
  i think that , as the uk is not part of schengen , it has the freedom to do whatever it wants . 
  it makes it a little easier for eu/eea citizens though , because the uk is ( at least for the time being ) part of the eu and eu citizens have the right to work in the uk . 
  schengen is what dictates border policies .
