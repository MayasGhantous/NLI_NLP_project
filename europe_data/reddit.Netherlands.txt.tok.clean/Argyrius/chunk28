  for the usa the percentage is almost three times higher than it is for us . 
  i spent 6 months on erasmus exchange in surrey , and the locals would never believe me when i told them that the weather in surrey was much much better than what i was used to back home . 
  swimming , diving , running , archery , fencing , judo , tae-kwon-do , basketball , water polo . 
  i can go on and on . 
  i basically love it all , the olympics are awesome . 
  if i had to pick a favourite though , it would probably be between running , swimming and basketball . 
  funnily enough , i 'm a huge football fan but the football at the olympics rarely has me as excited as the other sports , if at all . 
  we had a second hand orange yaris a few years ago ( like [ this one ] ( https://littlegingerinthebigworld.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ginge.jpg ) ) , it was ... let 's say unique, 
  officially it 's a [ lion ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/state_coat_of_arms_of_the_netherlands.svg/2000px-state_coat_of_arms_of_the_netherlands.svg.png ) ... it 's actually [ cheese ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bvei926iyaio44i.jpg ), 
  my family owns a white car , i 'm triggered !, 
  no but seriously , this is the first time that i 've heard that . 
  data for 2015 grey : 31.8 % black : 24.8 % white : 19 % the first ` real ' colour in popularity is blue with 12 % . 
  the top colours are all very boring imo . 
  if you wan na see the rest : http://www.autoblog.nl/nieuws/top-10-populairste-autokleuren-van-nederland-2015-82467 ( source is in dutch ), 
   as soon as i started a conversation , the dutch would respond back in english i 'm guilty of that too . 
  i need to actively stop myself from speaking english whenever i 'm talking to someone learning dutch . 
  dutch people just do n't have any pride in the dutch language the way french people have pride in the french language , for example . 
  we value practicality and easy communication more . 
  there has always been a cult following of motorsports in the netherlands . 
  the tt at assen always pulls a good crowd and you see a lot of dutch fans at the german and belgian f1 grand prix ' . 
  it was never mainstream popular though until recently when max verstappen started doing well . 
  1.12 million people tuned in to watch max verstappen win the spanish grand prix on ziggo sport earlier this year , which is a lot for a channel behind a paywall . 
  there used to be a lot of critique on motorsports in the past for being harmful to the environment ( incompatible with late 20th century progressive dutch culture ) , and motorsports is also a bit of an aristocratic sport because of the big costs associated with running a race . 
  rich people , or people with enough backing are more likely to get chances in motorsports which does n't appeal to some people , cause we dutchies are an egalitarian bunch . 
  i believe that these two factors are the biggest reasons that motorsports used to be more of a cult-thing here . 
   what is your favorite football club ? 
  how many games do you go to per year ? 
  ajax amsterdam , 5-10 games a year  how heated is your biggest rivalry ? 
  would you feel safe wearing your team 's jersey alone in your rival team 's city/territory ? 
  what about in their stadium ( outside the designated visiting fan section ) ? 
  is football ` hooligan ' culture a big problem in your country ? 
  ajax-feyenoord is the most heated rivalry in the netherlands . 
  it 's a rivalry between the two biggest cities in the netherlands , but also between two classes of society . 
  ajax was traditionally seen as the more aristocratic club from the capital ( snobby and arrogant , priding itself in beautiful football ) , while feyenoord is the working-class club of the dockworkers of rotterdam ( passionate , hard and sometimes dirty football ) . 
  football hooliganism was a big problem in the late 90s , resulting in big battles ( like the [ battle of beverwijk ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_beverwijk ) ) and even deaths . 
  this has since calmed down , but there 's still the occasional fighting . 
  i would n't really feel safe wearing an ajax jersey in rotterdam , much less so in the stadium . 
  in rotterdam i 've seen skinheads wearing `` 100 % anti-ajax '' bomberjacks on public transport on a normal weekday . 
  the hate runs deep for many . 
  edit : one of my favourite chants is probably a traditional dutch christmas song which ajax fans turned into a chant . 
  the shepherds were laying at night they were laying at night in the field there they heard angels singing `` ajax , ajax , ajax '', 
  why are you asking him this ? 
  he is just explaining what he thinks that particular redditor meant , which is something different from that which you understood . 
  the guy you quoted most probably does n't care about korea opening its borders , he cares more about what europe should or should not do ( in his opinion ) . 
  it heavily depends on the country . 
  i think wrc is much more popular in finland ( which has a lot of nature suited to rallying and has produced many drivers ) than in the netherlands for example . 
  i do n't follow wrc closely myself ( i follow other autosports like f1 and indycar closely though ) , but whenever it 's on television i watch it . 
  the netherlands does n't really have prominent rally teams or drivers , but i used to support subaru ( who sadly stopped wrc quite some time ago ) , as my father has always driven subarus . 
  the blue and gold 555 livery is iconic and i still have a bit of a dream of having a blue wrx sti with gold rims . 
  as to why it is n't popular in america , no idea . 
  the same thing could be asked about nascar in europe i guess . 
  it just is n't ingrained in the car culture . 
  a friend of mine studied at northwestern university in chicago last year . 
  i do n't think he had ever seen as much snow in his lifetime as he did there . 
  true , fair point, 
  old ladies will always stare at everyone . 
  in my village in greece they 're always sitting together , looking at the people passing by and gossiping about everyone , especially cause they know most people they see . 
  do n't worry too much about that  it 's common for those old ladies to wear black clothes ( out of mourning when their husband or another family member has passed away or even out of solidarity for other old ladies ) , i too am always baffled how they manage to survive with those long black dresses . 
  i sometimes make the mistake of wearing black jeans in the sun , gets so hot . 
  as with everything , it depends on where in europe of course . 
  in the netherlands the days for shorts , flipflops and sundresses are few and far in between . 
  but when it gets hot people dress for it . 
  today was the first day i wore shorts instead of jeans myself . 
  i 'm half-greek , and in greece it 's common for people ( adults mostly ) to wear long clothes into the summer . 
  people still want to look classy and serious even though it 's hot much of the year . 
  people are also used to the heat , a lot of the time when my family wears a jacket i wear a t-shirt . 
  spaniards and portuguese will not be wearing sundresses and sandals at the end of october . 
  also remember that it 's generally hotter through the year in california than it is in southern europe . 
  southern europe is on approximately the same latitude as northern california . 
  san francisco is quite a bit colder than la for example . 
  honestly i just know about it because i 'm very interested in japanese and trying to learn it haha . 
  would never have known otherwise . 
  yeah , when i said sometimes i was referring to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classification_of_the_japonic_languages#korean_hypothesis ) , 
  yeah that 's true , pretty much only korean is sometimes linked to japanese ... 
  definitely !, 
  for one thing , being multilingual makes it easier for you to understand the general structure of languages . 
  for example , speaking greek since birth , i already knew instinctively what grammatical cases were . 
  dutch does n't have them ( well , technically it does , but you 'll hardly ever encounter it ) , so in school it was much more difficult for my classmates , who only grew up with dutch , to understand grammatical cases in german than it was for me . 
  another thing is that when you know a language in a certain language branch , it 'll make it easier for you to learn the languages related to that language . 
  i had latin in school and it helped me a lot in learning and understanding french , spanish and italian . 
   i 'm working on learning russian now , but it 's slow going . 
  i know how you feel , it 's the same for me with japanese , it 's so new ( with three different alphabets ) and unrelated to any other language i know , that it makes getting even a basic understanding of the language very hard . 
  native : dutch fluent : greek , english basic : spanish enough to survive : italian , french and german learning : japanese within europe i 've always felt comfortable language-wise , and even outside europe i think i 'd survive in most places . 
  language is not really an issue for me when i look at where to go , one way or another you 'll survive . 
  `` i fart in your general direction ! '', 
  my first alcohol was probably somewhere around 9 years old , when i was allowed to taste some of my parents ' red wine . 
  the first time i ordered alcohol myself was probably a beer when i was about 12-13 ? 
  it was in my village in greece so unless you were drinking yourself into a coma the barkeeper did n't really mind , he knew me . 
  people may think you 're joking , but it 's true . 
  dutch guys are notorious for having a tendency to use a lot of ( quite often too much ) gel in their hairstyles , often resulting in a look that is perceived as a bit dirty-looking by foreigners . 
  i have been able to recognize dutch men abroad based on that multiple times . 
  well , i know that in greek switzerland is `` elvetia '', 
  that would make sense , it 's one of those things that would n't really make an impact if i did n't know beforehand what it was . 
  i live close to amsterdam , was there today too so maybe i 'll notice one soon too . 
  never seen them here, 
  was n't able to find the exact case study i had , but there are many others . 
  [ this one ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vsnl3lre1yej:highered.mheducation.com/sites/dl/free/007352994x/862122/case_2_1_the_not_so_wonderful_world_of_eurodisney.pdf+&amp;cd=14&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=nl ) should give you an idea . 
  the formatting looks a bit weird cause it 's a google web cache of a pdf file . 
  i did n't want to give you a link that immediately downloads a pdf file , so this link you can just open and read in your browser . 
  yeah it 's basically that , every new post hits front page and is visible so there 's not a lot of people that bother to upvote threads .
