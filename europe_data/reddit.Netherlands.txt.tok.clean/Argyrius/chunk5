  it 's interesting that even though the irish bouzouki is a pretty ` new ' ( still about half a century ) instrument it has evolved into a very distinctive one . 
  if you would n't know beforehand then you would n't make the connection between the irish and the greek bouzouki . 
  as someone with greek heritage i will have to mention the [ bouzouki ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ddachl76do ) . 
  probably the most recognizable greek instrument . 
  there 's also : * [ pontic lyra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1whcdm48ze ) * [ cretan lyra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsttkrqhxqc ) * [ laouto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ypp7ttq-fi ) * [ baglamas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx6hni4d_xu ) edit : all greek ofcourse, 
  field hockey probably . 
  in high school i used to have a just about even split between classmates playing football and classmates playing field hockey . 
  it 's okay my danish friend , you do n't have to join the brits , join us like you always did in the anglo-dutch wars !, 
  [ invaded ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glorious_revolution ) , you say ? 
  i 'd love to know as well , i 've just spent this season trying to work through some of my backlog ( without much success ), 
  ' \u039b\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf ' is a bit broad , it means ` sausage ' as well . 
  in my experience it 's more common for greeks to say ' \u03c7\u03bf\u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03ba ' when they want to say ` hot dog ' . 
  that sounds awfully similar to dutch university . 
  a winning formula ? 
  those damn finns again, 
  the sub has moved on to a different punching bag, 
  we were shite, 
  yeah why are the guys who invented the thing in the first place in the olympics ?? 
   why is the netherlands not part of the ec ? 
  the germans probably enjoy asking that a lot, 
   remember people to be polite hah ... edit : in all seriousness , i do n't think i 've ever been as excited about an ama as i am about this one, 
   some people hated in sweden the danish ?? 
  this is just the case with any community . 
  do n't get me wrong , it 's shitty sometimes and as someone who 's half-greek i 've dealt with it first-hand for years , but with any big group of people , whether offline or online , norms , values and popular opinions form attracting more people who agree with them and pushing people away who do n't agree with them , thus resulting in an echo chamber . 
  especially on a medium like reddit where the whole purpose of the site is to upvote things you like . 
   i love the banter , i just hate getting downvoted when i say things people do n't agree with , even when i present facts . 
  this literally happens to everyone on reddit , not just brits, 
   i ca n't imagine how greeks and to a lesser extent portuguese and spanish must have felt a few years ago , seeing all that vitriol and hate , those sweeping generalisations and the appalling lack of empathy in so many threads on the financial crisis . 
  this basically made me avoid this subreddit for about a year . 
  the hate on greeks continued with the refugee crisis too, 
  salsa , tequila , corazon , cerveza , [ muy bueno ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77ms1ocidh4 ), 
  used to be like that in greece too until 15 years ago iirc . 
  i mean , look at her , is n't romana * incredibly sexy * ? 
  muh sovereignty, 
  jokes aside , the amount of byzantine treasures on display in venice looted in 1204 is staggering . 
  beautiful golden icons , chalices , plates etc , adorned with gemstones . 
  it really showed how rich the byzantine empire was . 
  this comic connects with me deeply , below sea level, 
  well yeah , that particular st stephen was the first king of hungary . 
  the rest of europe celebrates a different st stephen in december or january . 
  * poldering intensifies *, 
  it 's fake , but miyazaki has repeatedly expressed his dissatisfaction with the state of the modern anime industry . 
  i never actually realised that they were greek , my family owns some folli follie watches and somehow i always assumed they were french or something . 
  if i would ( which i would n't ) , it would be because because that 's the generation that seemed to have it all economically , and still has it best, 
  they 'll probably start taxing the fuck out of them, 
  too ( edit : not two ! ), 
  bad many of us here were only born about two decades ago, 
  the realist in me is saying `` yes , we should '' , but the petrolhead in me is crying `` please no '', 
  i 'm only half-greek so i might not be the correct person to judge , but while in my experience many greeks do indeed feel somewhat distinct from the balkans because of both historical ( cold war ) and ancestral reasons , at the same time they have a lot of shared history , for example the many centuries under the byzantine and later the ottoman empire , and culture , for example eastern orthodox religion and foods . 
  serbians are often considered greece 's closest friends ( or even brothers ) , and some greek neo-nazis and mercenaries even fought alongside the serbs in the yugoslav wars to support their orthodox brothers . 
  milosevic even tried to get talks going for a confederation with greece in 1994 , but no one in greece was interested . 
  to give another example of shared history , in the region in central greece where my family comes from , there are a lot of towns originally settled by slavic peoples during the middle ages , which are often still referred to with their old slavic names ( after that many centuries all slavic peoples have long since assimilated with the local greek population , and thus are indistinguishable ) , even though they 've been renamed to have greek names . 
  cuts have been applied to people currently receiving pensions , sometimes even retroactively . 
  this message was brought to you by the greek ministry of tourism . 
  i got a ptsd attack from you mentioning our bikes getting stolen . 
  yeah this is a bit of a pointless question if it 's just `` fight for your country '' . 
  i 'd sure as hell never fight in an expeditionary war , but if my country was being invaded and my family was in danger then i would most probably fight . 
  there were in the coup though !, 
  he must have been using mods . 
  there are actually quite a lot of 'em in the netherlands !, 
  i think i know about 20 of them myself . 
  so the whole coup was just some random guy standing there with a keyboard in his hands spawning helicopters , tanks and fighter jets ??!!, 
  this is what i remember too . 
  english people told me that i as a dutchman could study in in scotland for free , but english people could n't . 
  * i-it 's not like i wanted to sue you anyway , b-baka !, 
  both work https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rommel#noun, 
  i always chuckle seeing rommel , as it means trash in dutch, 
  what is he gon na do ? 
  bomb the middle-east even more and motivate even more terrorist organisations in the region ? 
  genuine question . 
  in a sense it is , but i dislike it . 
  why not encourage people to keep learning ? 
  for example , i 've finished my bachelor 's degree , and i 'm doing my master 's degree . 
  i 've been introduced to programming this year , and i would be interested to pursue it further to combine it with the things i learned during my first bachelor 's degree when i start working . 
  in another country you 'd just start another bachelor 's programme , computer science , for example . 
  here however i 'm hugely discouraged to continue developing myself , as it means that if i decided that i want to do computer science i will have to pay at least another 30.000 euros to complete that programme . 
  with first study op means the first bachelor and master 's degree you complete . 
  if you 've gotten your first bachelor 's degree , you 're entitled to one master 's degree for 2000 , however if you decide to start a second bachelor 's programme , you will be paying a lot more , depending on the programme . 
  generally this is 10.000 or higher for a bachelor 's degree . 
  yeah it 's aleviet in dutch too , understandable mistake , i thought it was alevite in english too . 
  i do n't know where you are , but stay safe dude , it hurts me to see turkey like this, 
  yes , but / u/xeno87 was probably referring to this https://twitter.com/mhmtslmz/status/754211994585141248, 
  freddo cappuccino is where it 's at mate, 
  a combination of factors including but not limited to : * our lord and saviour arjen robben being injured for most of the qualifying matches * robin van persie being in terrible form for both his club and the nt * half our decent defenders being injured * depay in shit form ever since he went to man utd * switching back from the successful 5-3-2 formation from the world cup with louis van gaal to the more traditional dutch 4-3-3 under guus hiddink and danny blind * scoring own goals in matches that would 've otherwise earned us points * those crazy icelanders having their best team ever in the years that we encounter them in the qualifying stages we were doing well in the friendlies before the euros though , beating poland , austria and england a couple of months earlier , so there 's that i guess . 
  that goes for our whole nt tbh, 
  i am now blaming you for our 2nd place in 2010 , why did you have to bet on us ? 
  i like to think that the pitch was full of venomoth for pok\u00e9mon go players too, 
  it 's ok dude , we share a land border with you in spirit . 
  low countries , bicycle users and ugly languages , we must be brothers separated at birth . 
  yeah , `` nee eu '' does n't make sense . 
  no idea if they wanted to say `` no eu '' ( as in an absence/lack of eu ) which would have to be `` geen eu '' or `` no against the eu '' which would have been `` nee tegen de eu '' . 
  definitely not written by a dutchman . 
  sounds like something you 'd say to a kid when they do something they 're not allowed to , like `` no , johnny !, 
  do n't do that !, 
  i ship it, 
   also interesting that the netherlands hates donald but pvv is polling well . 
  i dont like either of those so i do n't know , but the explanation could be that trump represents everything that 's bad about the us to dutch people ( like loony gun laws ) , which makes wilders pretty tame in comparison . 
  really dude ? 
  yeah he can be very hit-or-miss , but this one was actually funny for the most part, 
  english will most probably stay the main language,
