yeah but when this happens in turkey you all love to bark . 
  damn polish ... * ottoman rage intensifies *, 
  i dont think so . 
  its just that geographical names come and go , calling it armenian higlands is simply inaccurate . 
  same way people stopped calling eastern germany and western poland prussia . 
  the politcally correct modern terminology is infact eastern anatolia , which is simply pretty much all of asian turkey . 
  like i said , its * historic * armenian highlands . 
  the same way most of krg is * historic * assyria . 
  its not that we misinterpreted it as western armenia or any form of pan-ideology . 
  personally i really dont care . 
  i find it absurd how bad our relationship is purelly based on literally one single major issue . 
  now granted we might have different views on what happened in 1915 but who would have thought it will get to the point of having zero diplomatic ties ? 
  all based on one single disagreement . 
  its freaking ridicilous if you think about it . 
  calling it armenian highlands is absurd considering almost no armenians live there anymore . 
  its * historic * armenian higlands , as of today its eastern anatolia and as such is widely recognized as exactly that . 
  not out to start a shit storm or anything but i think thats the reason people are downvoting it . 
  are you high ? 
  under what rock were you living ? 
  every single country is out to spread their influence and turkey is no exception . 
  to use this as an argument for neo-ottomanism is fucking laughable and absurd . 
  whenever a country wants to spread influence ( which all countries do ) it ** has ** to be a neo - and/or pan - ideology orientated ? 
  i also love how you are desperatly trying to point out a non existing status quo by calling it an `` authoritarian '' and `` unstable '' country , showing the bias and childish mindset clear as it can be . 
  neo-ottomanism is a thing the same way neo-nazi 's are a thing . 
  actions speak louder then words , and even with the current conflicts within syria we have no interests in annexing anything . 
  plus the invasion of cyprus was based on legal grounds according to the treaty of guarentee , and even then we initially had no plans for a long establishing any form of state within cyprus . 
  this only happened after talks failed . 
  you really are just barking the same empty rhetorics like the next anti-turkey retard does . 
  what ? 
  expansionists how ? 
  since the republic was formed the only land we annexed to it was the hatay province and that was nearly 80 years ago . 
  that was actually pretty cool . 
  totally made my day . 
  congratulations to our neighbours !, 
  love posts that arent all about the genocide circlejerk whenever armenia is mentioned . 
  moments like these are rare . 
  may the future be bright . 
  coming from a cypriot , how fucking ironic . 
  i was about to say the same thing . 
  playing the victim now after you got your arze handed to you ? 
  lovely , 
  then you sure gave turkey a nice reason to do exactly that . 
  attacking turkish cypriots on a daily bases to the point of them being forced to group together and reinforce their villages against attacks from greek cypriots . 
  its hard for greek cypriots to talk about legitimacy when they breached a treaty that held their entire existence together . 
  stop crying about it loser , you fucked up and now you try to play the victim . 
  boehoeeee turkey invaded cyprus based on an agreement which we signed . 
  whether the junta fell is not even important , they tried enosis and we crushed that little fantasy of theirs . 
  it happened , so the turkish invasion happened . 
  learn from it . 
  why give a base to britain then ? 
  bitch about that for an hour and fuck off . 
  it is for the short/medium terms . 
  there is no confidence among both greek and turkish cypriots and lets be realistic here , turkey would ** never ** allow a strategic asset such as trnc to go to waste after all the international backslash and military internvention . 
  realistically speaking , if you want a unified cyprus you have to show turkey that it wants to cooperate with it , not fight against it . 
  geopolitics isnt about intentions , its about capabilities . 
  and cyprus is still a treath to turkey geopolitically whether they intented as such or not . 
  this can be seen in the many military excerises they do with greece , russia and even with israel shortly after the flotilla incident . 
  the only way to ensure neutrality or cooperation is to offer a permanent military base within cyprus . 
  to ensure geopolitical interests and the safety of turkish cypriots on the long run . 
  the junta fell ** because ** of the turkish invasion . 
  dont go around twisting events around . 
  love your delusion , the greeks were the victims yeah suuuuuure buddy lol . 
  you gon na ignore the mass murders , rapes , occupation of turkish side , ethnic cleansing , appropiated its property , looted its mosques and museums . 
  sure buddy . 
  we also killed millions of native americans and raped their babies to death . 
  dont forget how we chopped them up and made nice crispy bacon bits out of them aswell . 
  because history right ? 
  i am almost glad the russians fucked you . 
  really now ? 
  if we are going to talk about who agreed to what then lets have a lovely dialogue about the treaty of guarantee and how every single party ** agreed ** to it aswell . 
  but ofcourse you love barking about turkish invasion being `` illegal '' while the british military presence is totally not right ? 
  if your military base is legitimate , then the turkish invasion was aswell . 
  like i said , if you can whore your territory off to the brits , then you can to the turks aswell . 
  all for the sake of unifcation right ? 
  then lets just ethnically cleans them because why not ? 
  i suppose we should kill off all non native americans in the us while we are at it . 
  or the brits on the falklands and etc. 
  i support a unified cyprus under several conditions . 
  biggest ones would be autonomy and a permanent turkish base . 
  if you can whore your territory off to the brits then the turks should not be much of a problem aswell . 
  it already is a puppet state . 
  because there are almost non in turkey dumbass . 
  all of those ethnic groups combined wouldnt even make up a single percent of the total population . 
  the biggest ethnic group , the kurds have been a part of the goverment and are always ensured to hold high positions . 
  we ** did ** defend kobani . 
  in the earlier stages of the siege turkey allowed kurdish fighters from iraqi kurdistan to flood into the city via turkish soil and it bombed several isis positions with artillery and jets . 
  infact the ypg leader salih muslim and krg actually thanked turkey for it at one point . 
  i am gon na search for the source hold on . 
  edit : here you go ! ', 
  http://aa.com.tr/en/politics/iraqi-kurdish-leader-thanks-turkey-for-kobani-support/106363 http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/kobane-residents-eye-return-kurdish-group-thanks-turkey.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=77594 the only thing we got in return was suicide bombings and support for the pkk . 
  this two faced organisation is nothing more then an oppurtunistic terrorists organisation that tries to portray itself as something different . 
  that was some fine blitzkrieg . 
  which is probably why denk never truelly opposes erdogan and in many cases even support him . 
  at the end of the day denk like any other political party is just looking out for its self interests . 
  whilst there is definitly some attention given towards denk , no actual promoting is done yet on a main stream level . 
  right from the getgo denk is made out to be this party thats created by/for `` allochtonen '' , people will blindly vote for them even though most of them are probably right wing fanatica in their own way . 
  when the time comes , they will probably vote for denk regardless of their ideology . 
  what a time to be alive indeed ... 
  my answer is more fucked up then you think . 
  they dont even know what denk is , they dont care about dutch politics at all .
