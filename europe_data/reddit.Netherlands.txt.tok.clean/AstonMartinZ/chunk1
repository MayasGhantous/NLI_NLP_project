i hope it does n't cost too much . 
  and mohamed, 
  that 's why i can buy a apartment with a price of a castle ? 
  you know they charge rent for living there and for selling your goods there ? 
  history repeats itself . 
  so a crusade ? 
  not enough spreadsheets . 
  this post i a load of bull . 
  jeez dude your life must be shit . 
  want to talk about it . 
  from your arse ... 
  that 's true . 
  will see how the future will be with uk . 
  lots of things gon na happen than uk out of europe , schotland out of uk . 
  will see . 
  source ? 
  i hope this is gon na be a positive change . 
  no i meant that you are every person living in flanders . 
  you must have a lot of personalities . 
  illuminati man !, 
  probably . 
  you 're a weird dude . 
  that 's pretty scary stuff . 
  your name is incorrect , think of changing it . 
  go play american dumbass somewhere else , thank you . 
  no potatoes sadly . 
  so i should believe russian state owned media ? 
  i think its time for your pills little timmy !, 
  also : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sultanate_of_rum http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_asia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_anatolian_turkish http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oghuz_languages, 
  i still stand with my statment . 
  turkmen migrated with their families and possessions on seljuk campaigns into azerbaijan and anatolia , a process that began the turkification of these areas . 
  from : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_turkmenistan, 
  true it isnt where it all started , i should of said where part of the ancestry started . 
  that was what i was saying . 
  turkisch people have a connection with turkmen . 
  also did your people just fell out of the sky into anatolia and start kicking some byzzies ass ? 
  turkic peoples and related groups migrated west from turkestan and what is now mongolia towards eastern europe , iranian plateau and anatolia and modern turkey in many waves . 
  [ 83 ] the date of the initial expansion remains unknown . 
  after many battles , they established their own state and later created the ottoman empire . 
  [ 84 ] the main migration occurred in medieval times , when they spread across most of asia and into europe and the middle east . 
  [ 63 ] they also participated in the crusades . 
  it is where it started though . 
  yes could be i used the dutch term for it sorry !, 
  they should go back to turkmenistan !, 
  to be honest i dont know what i would have done if i were a soldier in that base . 
  because you 're there to help . 
  this wasnt supposed to be like this . 
  because this was a peace mission . 
  i geuss they forgot to tell the enemy not to bring large weapons . 
  i understand i just wanted to make clear the soldiers where in no position to do something , sadly . 
  but yeah in terms of organisation there where a lot of things wrong . 
  so the dutch soldiers had too shoot at armoud vehicles with there shitty weapons and limited amount of ammo ? 
  wow its legal in turkey ? 
  til, 
  indeed not them . 
  yeah not them of course , they have dudes on their mind . 
  also no a-sexuals . 
  who doesnt . 
  nice one !, 
  stupid immigrants doing work we do n't want to do . 
  he seems like a cool dude who you can drink a beer with . 
  and just as i wanted bring my yacht to australia and make it my home ;(, 
  i know i should have . 
  nice , i 'm happy to hear that . 
  i 'm not an eastern european , but my thought about russia drastically changed in 6 months . 
  russia needs to accepted that there not a great european power anymore , they need to leave eastern europe alone and give crimea back to ukraine and pay back the cost ukraine made . 
  sorry if i went of topic . 
  and a few french words . 
  is a dutch person i dont mind speaking english , because its handy . 
  and also i heard dutch is hard to learn . 
  didnt you know . 
  putin will announce that soon . 
  thats true , didnt really didnt think that one through . 
  and thats why fossil feuls wil be staying for a while . 
  but i expect when batterylife and how fast they charge will bring more '' clean '' cars . 
  and than we still need cleaner energy supplies . 
  come back when i can buy a cheap fossilfeul free car . 
  listen to putin the internet is a instrument of the cia and you shouldnt use it . 
  this gives hope for other eastern european countries . 
  murica !, 
  we are still dependent on a few things with russia . 
  yeah true , that would make sense . 
  than it seems they wont be in the eu if they going to be independent it seems . 
  you re correct i just read overseas french territories and assumed it was for all their territories . 
  did some digging and they belong to a [ special collectivity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overseas_departments_and_territories_of_france#special_collectivity ) . 
  so sorry for that . 
  haha love this bot . 
   but the link you provided actually supports my statement . 
   it became an outermost region and thus part of the eu on 1 january 2014,

  companies are not one person , companies are large structures full of people , and probably conduct business with 100 's of people like him each year . 
  they do n't know what happend to that man . 
  or something like that . 
  [ checks out , i guess ?
