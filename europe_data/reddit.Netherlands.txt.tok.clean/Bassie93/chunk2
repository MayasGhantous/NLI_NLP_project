  i have never heard someone say it in my entire life . 
  diener is not even a word ... 
  probably because they think belgium is the capital of brussels or something . 
  i 'm also not a `` child of rome '' because the area where i 'm from has never even been under roman rule ... 
  i honestly never knew this :o, 
  well . 
  ... * they * started it !, 
  so police * are * allowed to arrest them ? 
  nom . 
  yeah , sorry , i should have said umlaut . 
  well the sound is different but it is still an o. 
  it 's just pronounced differently with an umlaut on it . 
  ... because they do n't have that sound ? 
  are \u00e4 \u00f6 \u00fc separate letters then ? 
  it 's just a , o and u with a diaeresis on them . 
  we have that too . 
  just like the politicians . 
  i knew a guy from sorrento who was that tall . 
  now that was a strange sight . 
  1.74 in the netherlands . 
  thanks dad for being italian ... 
  there are many great european inventions , true . 
  though there are just as many terrible european inventions . 
  and * the * most important and basic inventions of all time come from the middle east . 
  europeans just had the luck of being a particularly warlike people living in a very fertile area of the world . 
  and i disagree that schools teach history as it is . 
  i do n't know how it is where you live , but here they left out all the nasty bits about the netherlands ' history and merely focussed on how awesome a country it always was . 
  as is logical , i think it goes that way in every country . 
  but i 'm fairly certain that in asian and african history lessons europe is not as awesome as it is in the history lessons here . 
  i did n't say it was * the * reason . 
  historical events like that do n't have one sole reason . 
  but do you disagree that a lack of relevance since , like , forever attributed to wanting to be the most powerful nation in europe ? 
  sure they started to conguer some areas at the beginning of the 20th century ( i never knew that btw , but ok ) . 
  but they never were a great naval power , with a vast empire across the globe , like spain , france , england , even the netherlands . 
  i 'm convinced being a relatively young nation with little impressive military history contributed to the rivalry with other european countries . 
  maybe . 
  though civilizations like the chinese or the sumerians did pretty important world changing inventions too  call me cynical , but i still think `` patriottic propaganda '' is a better name for the thing they call history in schools . 
  germany . 
  it 's one of the reasons they tried to conquer europe ( twice ) once they had united . 
  no , you 're right . 
  it 's just , great people are born everywhere . 
  we only hear about the european and some american ones in history class . 
  and you 're right on the white thing , brainfart from my part xd, 
  yeah , i should n't have imposed my `` southern experiences '' on the whole country . 
  i know it 's different in the north . 
  my experience ? 
  oh i absolutely * love * being there . 
  i have n't been for too long , but the times i am in italy i 'm having the time of my life . 
  i love the food , the way of living , the people are amazing . 
  but i 'm also realistic enough to know i 'm looking at it with a foreigners ' holiday perspective . 
  my family and my dad 's old friends who still live there do n't think it 's so amazing . 
  they love their city , but they 'd rather go somewhere else . 
  they envy my father for `` escaping '' ( someone actually said that once ) . 
   there 's a reason almost every great person is born in europe . 
  yeaaah , this is where things get a little too nsdap-like . 
  i think there is a reason white supremacism was born in europe . 
  we 're arrogant douchebags if we do n't mind ourselves . 
  and i think the only reason great people were so predominantly born in europe is because `` we '' genocided and enslaved the rest of the world before they could have great people for themselves . 
  i admit my picture of italy may be kinda biased because all the places i 've been to are mostly in the south . 
  but while i like to exaggerate , things really * can * actually be pretty bad down there . 
  and sure i would still be the same person i am now had i been born in naples , but since my father comes from a pretty poor and chanceless family , i 'd have had more chance of turning out to be just another jobless junkie or drugdealer than the spoiled university student i am now , a thing i am very well aware of . 
  to answer your question : as i have lived here my whole life , and have had more interaction with dutch people and relatives than italian people and relatives ( though i have been said to get pretty `` italian '' after being there a couple of days ) i 'm gon na go with i feel more dutch . 
  and as such i hold to my right to sarcastically yet lovingly spew crap on anything and everything , and not to take things too seriously  i 'm not sure you understand what i meant with the working hard thing . 
  i am sure you are a decent , hard working person and upstanding citizen ( no sarcasm ) . 
  though that was n't what i meant . 
  i always get a little icky when people proudly talk about how `` we '' achieved this and that , especially coming from someone in a country that has n't really been powerful sonce the roman empire , let 's be honest . 
  `` we '' did n't achieve shit . 
  europe has become rich and once powerful because our forefathers where the persons they were , happening to have been born in the places they did . 
  the only thing * our * generation has achieved so far is binge drinking and drug abuse ( not necessarily all bad , it 's something i indulge in myself fairly regularly ) . 
   we had colonies although they were n't as big as british ones . 
  we had libya , somalia and ethiopia . . yeah , i mean like a real empire , not a couple years ' occupation . 
   yeah well so has germany . 
  yes , i know . 
   how ? 
  how are we the mexico of europe ? 
  how ? 
  in what way ? 
  oh i do n't know , completely torn apart by gangs and corruption ? 
   when have i said we ? 
   ** we worked hard to achieve this . 
  do n't get me wrong though , i 'm italian myself . 
  my family moved here 25 years ago . 
  i think it 's a wonderfull , lovely country and people . 
  i 'm just super glad i got to spend my youth in the netherlands and not in the anarchist hell hole that is naples, 
  the more fancy historical ones in my city look like [ this ] ( https://maps.google.nl/maps/myplaces?ll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;spn=0.000373,0.001032&amp;amp;ctz=-120&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=21&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;panoid=jmabt8oynot_rqzlcwdwfq&amp;amp;cbp=12,333.83,,0,1.35 ) . 
  [ these ] ( https://maps.google.nl/maps/myplaces?ll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;spn=0.000373,0.001032&amp;amp;ctz=-120&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=21&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;panoid=jmabt8oynot_rqzlcwdwfq&amp;amp;cbp=12,333.83,,0,1.35 ) are more common historical buildings . 
  [ these ] ( https://maps.google.nl/maps/myplaces?ll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;spn=0.000373,0.001032&amp;amp;ctz=-120&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=21&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;panoid=jmabt8oynot_rqzlcwdwfq&amp;amp;cbp=12,333.83,,0,1.35 ) are typically 60 's / 70 's built `` row houses '' ( rijtjeshuizen ) . 
  i do n't do n't know exactly what time [ this ] ( https://maps.google.nl/maps/myplaces?ll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;spn=0.000373,0.001032&amp;amp;ctz=-120&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=21&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;panoid=jmabt8oynot_rqzlcwdwfq&amp;amp;cbp=12,333.83,,0,1.35 ) is from , i believe they were built before the war , but i 'm not sure . 
  [ this ] ( https://maps.google.nl/maps/myplaces?ll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;spn=0.000373,0.001032&amp;amp;ctz=-120&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=21&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;panoid=jmabt8oynot_rqzlcwdwfq&amp;amp;cbp=12,333.83,,0,1.35 ) is what modern houses look like ( these were built ten years ago ) , and [ this ] ( https://maps.google.nl/maps?hl=nl&amp;tab=wl ) ( older , less rich ) and [ this ] ( https://maps.google.nl/maps/myplaces?ll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;spn=0.000373,0.001032&amp;amp;ctz=-120&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=21&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=51.484521,5.446838&amp;amp;panoid=jmabt8oynot_rqzlcwdwfq&amp;amp;cbp=12,333.83,,0,1.35 ) ( newer , richest ) is where the obscenely rich live . 
  the newest apartments in town i ca n't show you because they were built right after google maps went through the city . 
  but they 're really pretty , way better than those godawful [ 80 's / 90 's style flats ] ( https://maps.google.nl/maps?hl=nl&amp;tab=wl ) ... 
  actually , while a pretty nice country to live in , according to newspapers the netherlands seems to be the only country who * has n't * been doing slightly less shitty over the last couple weeks . 
  not to be that guy , but all this is really ironic coming from one of the two only western european countries who never had colonies , only has existed as a country for a mere 150 years and is basically the mexico of europe . 
  just sayin ' . 
  also , who is `` we '' ? 
  do n't know about you , but the hardest * i * worked in my life was cropping tomatoes in a greenhouse for half a summer . 
  that 's just cute , you guys are such sweethearts in general . 
  dutch really leave nothing untainted when they start swearing . 
  i really do n't get the `` sh '' - thing . 
  that 's not how we pronounce the s :o,
