  and then when pension age kicks in , it 's gon na get better  we just got to hang in there , underground parties are way more fun than `` mainstream '' nightlife anyway , imo . 
   the dutch are a great musical culture . 
  you kidding ? 
  * not * the last couple of years , that 's for sure . 
  well there 's [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqlhazzc2xa ) . 
  though i do n't think it is common for dutch music videos to have lots of scantily dressed ladys in it . 
  and i would n't call that `` porn '' anyway , to be honest . 
  just hang out with a lot of hipsters . 
  suddenly you 'll can into all the nice music . 
  you 're confusing me , i 'm too sleepy for this xd, 
  haha oops , i 'm very bad at internet-irony ... facial expressions help with delivering irony  :o in my defense , i always hear about how we are so `` direct '' and even `` blunt '' , so in that light you could very well have been serious !, 
  we do , we just do n't like it much . 
  irony may come across as sarcasm and/or being hateful . 
  which it usually is ... we do it all the time though xd, 
  i understood his joke about coca cola . 
  it made me giggle , 
  yeah , i commented before i read the other comments . 
  apparently culturally , armenia is pretty generally considered europe . 
  i think it 's strange though , i never really thought of the kaukasus as european . 
  * not european . 
  because it 's not . 
  * hot girl from highschool . 
  * weird alphabet . 
  * system of a down . 
  that 's all i know about armenia/armenians . 
  it 's basically a really big campus . 
  1/3 ( maybe even slightly more ) of the population is student :d, 
  all come to groningen . 
  no wait , not all . 
  only fun people :p, 
  thou art forgiven , 
  yes , i know , that 's what i said . 
  she was canadian ; so obviously , she spoke with a canadian accent . 
  * usually * however , dutch english teachers speak with a british accent . 
  well ours was canadian . 
  so yeah . 
  but usually they speak with a british accent . 
  it 's not the official language , but a lot of philosophical material is written in german . 
  i always had the impression americans did n't do irony . 
  i rarely eat meat , actually . 
  lol, 
  well , i live by myself ; i do n't eat so much ; and there 's an aldi round the corner . 
  well ok , but i manage with a mere $ 50 , - must be doing something right , 
   problay 150 euros on food that 's an unnecessary lot of money if you ask me o_o, 
  i was eight , so i mostly thought `` oeh , shiny ! '' . 
  other than that , i was really psyched with the idea that now we could just go to germany , or belgium , or spain , or whatever , and pay with the * same freaking money * . 
  i thought it was awesome . 
  i come from [ kampen ] ( http://static.nationalgeographic.nl/pictures/genjuserphotopicture/original/22/14/21/kampen-in-de-winter-211422.jpg ) , a small , [ nice ] ( http://www.ervaarhetwaterreijk.nl/nl/images/225 ) and [ peaceful ] ( http://kampen.putten.mijnplaats.net/user_photo/48e879c874b0d2f9c000eb9aa46c8439.jpg ) [ city ] ( http://www.fambeens.nl/cms/data/images/panorama_kampen_nieuws_1280_01.jpg ) in the [ ijsseldelta ] ( http://www.svdwfotografie.nl/stocksjo/news/files/ijsseldelta_6_svdw.jpg ) . 
  yeah , me too . 
  i can understand the ban on minarets . 
  i personally would n't want the area where i live to be stuffed with giant religious symbols either , from any religion . 
  now imagine those symbols also making terrible noise five times a day ... * shudder * the churches every sunday morning are bad enough . 
  i think the writer of this article is confusing tolerance and freedom with doing whatever the hell you want . 
  i think he 's saying it is not extremely violent for parisian standards . 
  and journalists do tend to make more out of it than it is , namely just a few people who are displeased with a new law . 
   unless you 're saying the media is just outright lying come one , you 're american , you should know better . 
  ... why does it have saxon twice ? 
  as was the one about being able to connect to `` the divine '' without the church , yes or no . 
  neither , what `` divine '' ? 
  i 'm swedish ... 
  i would vote for esperanto becoming the official language . 
  not again !, 
  well , just leave us the hell alone this time , 
  no , that 's actually t-shirt weather up here . 
  you 're very right . 
  i 'm sorry , i misunderstood . 
  yeah , i know , that must be mostly it . 
  though even on reddit i 've spoken with people who had quite narrow-minded views . 
  i really love that sub !, 
  it makes me ridiculously happy . 
  why do you bring your country 's history in it ? 
  i think that has little to do with it . 
  we were once the first modern country to kick out their king , yet next week we are all expected to sing a truly horrendous song as the new king sits his ass on the throne . 
  if you ( or your contemporaries ) did n't accomplish it , do n't boast about it . 
  it makes you look like an ass . 
   southern europe is good at enjoying life . 
  northern europe is good at making money in a bit of a puritan , bland way . 
  do n't forget we invented the term `` gezellig '' , 
  you should write tourist manuals . 
   when people hear `` poland '' they immediately think about russia-like country that 's really not true , do n't worry . 
  matter of fact , i hardly ever think of russia when i hear `` eastern europe '' . 
  russia is just ... russia . 
  but . 
  * you 're a slavic people * you speak a slavic language eastern works for me . 
  honestly , anything further east than berlin is eastern europe to me . 
  you shall overcome , 
  i think that 's because people from outside holland who refer to themselves as ` echt hollands '' , actually mean that they 're conservative , stubborn , difficult people . 
  source : my mother . 
  i do n't know , personally i absolutely hate it when women paint every centimeter of their face . 
  doe gewoon normaal , if i wanted a colourful doll i would have bought one . 
  i 'm just asking a question . 
  because i 've met quite a handful of polish people , and only one of them did n't strike me as some conservative douchebag , straight from the 17th century . 
  it could very well be that western europe is just more progressive , right ? 
  we are not ... we do n't ... we have n't ... who am i kidding , no one ever says offensive stuff about us . 
   that 's why if you speak to your child in two languages it will be bilingual that 's not entirely how that works . 
   boys being raised to become feminized men you guys are a little backwards , are n't you ? 
  at least all the polish people i 've met/spoken to on reddit . 
   i 'm not homophobic but in my experience , every homophobic person uses this sentence to open their pledge on why they do n't consider themselves homophobic . 
  i do n't know , i was n't born yet . 
  but there was a ceremony , yes , and probably with musical aid .
