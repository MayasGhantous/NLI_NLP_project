it 's a long story . 
  woodstock festival is absolutely legendary , i went there last summer !, 
  the video does n't quite capture the scale of it though . 
  the lesson i 've learned during my travels as a dutchman abroad , is that people who ask me if i have weed , are always capable of providing it to me . 
  shit yes , i remember the beer crate curling in groningen !, 
  that was awesome . 
  edit : [ found the clip !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgna8yozweg ), 
  you should come visit the north . 
  we 've got decent snow of several days couple times each year . 
  i remember last year just after new year was crazy as well . 
  groningen is beautiful . 
  you do n't have a picture from the hoge & lage der a ? 
  but / r/netherlands literally stole their banner and css from / r/thenetherlands ... 
  true , eventually you 'd have to learn the language . 
  but if you 're very assertive to your dutch friends that you want them to speak dutch to you , then they will . 
  i heard from many brits that studying in the netherlands is a lot cheaper than in uk , so there you go . 
  come to the netherlands . 
  we have a great economy , awesome culture and we speak your language . 
  i hear '' < . .  sound like german '' or `` oh , like in german '' still many times unfortunately ... =(, 
  mikael how have you been doing mate, 
  there is no european culture . 
  the culture of the north differs from the south and the culture from the west differs from the east . 
  if one would try to define something that 's typical european , there 's always a couple of countries who do n't share that value . 
  that 's the beauty of the eu , it 's so diverse . 
  this is actually not just americans , but foreigners often assume i have weed with me , smoked it recently or can get some for them . 
  just a heads up , by european law you are entitled to a re-routing to your final destination or a refund of your flight if it is cancelled . 
  since you 're probably already heading to canada , i suggest to just request the refund . 
  you 're not entitled to an additional compensation however , because the flight was cancelled because of an extraordinary circumstance ( the strike ) .

  `` the low lands '' is kinda more poetic , just kinda . 
  lol , that 's like saying i like america because i like hamburgers . 
  the ratings are about the politics of america . 
  in the netherlands you do have to pay extra for ` statiegeld ' ( ` return money ' ? ), 
  for beer crates and most bottled beer , but you can get that money back by returning the crate with empty beers back to the supermarket to recycle it . 
  it does not apply to canned beer though . 
  the amount of ` statiegeld ' is not listed on the price tag , but is often like 10-25 cents per bottle or 3-4 euro per crate . 
  in the netherlands you commonly find an aisle dedicated to frozen meat that can be fried , like hamburgers , bitterballen , frikandels , krokets , fries or many other fried food you can find in the netherlands . 
  ( we love our fried food . ), 
  furthermore , plenty of supermarkets have a dispenser for a free cup of coffee or tea , or a [ orange juice machine ] ( http://www.pasfruit.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/machinesupermarkt.jpg ) to buy freshly made orange juice . 
  and yes , we also have a lot of different tastes of frozen pizza available . 
  edit : oh , and brand-wise , there is often several different brands available . 
  for example in the supermarket across the street they offer coke from coca cola , pepsi , the supermarket label itself and a very cheap brand . 
  all of them offer both normal and light versions and coca cola also offers zero and that new life taste there . 
  in another supermarket nearby they only offer normal coca cola and another cheap brand . 
  do americans fantasize about having rough sex with an european girl ? 
  no , not specifically ? 
  why ? 
  no , the typical college campus is secretly just a tiny version of the netherlands !, 
  uhm yeah , uhm ... we also got / r/trees ... 
  uhm , [ yeah ] ( http://www.ski-epic.com/amsterdam_bicycles/pm3s_amsterdam_bicycles.jpg ) [ sort off ] ( http://leakynews.s3.amazonaws.com/pub/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/picture1.jpg ) [ i guess ] ( http://www.janhof.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/amsterdam-fietsen-gracht-03.jpg ) ... 
  another fun fact : there are more bicycles in amsterdam than there are people , there is an estimated amount of 1 million bicycles , used by only 700k people . 
  the `` paasvuren '' ( eastern bonfires ) are definitely the best out there . 
  it 's not your typical bonfire . 
  it really depends on what you are looking for . 
  are you looking for lots of culture ? 
  beer drinking ? 
  partying ? 
  good looking girls ? 
  a well listed university ? 
  any interest in learning a specific language or culture ? 
  i 'm sure loads of universities are great places for a student exchange . 
  if you still want just a suggestion for a place : i would recommend utrecht in the netherlands . 
  the netherlands is very open towards foreigners and utrecht is one of the top student cities in the country , plus it 's a very beautiful city and not far away from places like amsterdam . 
  well it shows that the dutch are quite well involved in english media , because it 's not just 90 % because of our education . 
  this thread reminds me of [ this map ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iwantout/comments/3mb4ca/percentage_of_population_in_eu_countries_able_to/ ) , stating that 90 % of the dutch population is capable of holding a conversation in english , highest of all non-english countries in europe . 
  i would guess some people here speak some english . 
  as far as a i 've experienced , the general height `` rule '' for girls when it comes to dating , they prefer `` as long as he is taller than me '' . 
  i have n't seen them care much about it though , but maybe it 's just me ( i 'm 1.93 m , [ which is 6.3 feet or something ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=193+cm+to+feet+and+inches ) ) . 
  to what parks are you going ? 
  in the netherlands you can walk , sit , lay down , picnic , on the grass in pretty much every park . 
  sorry i meant baltics . 
  either way , we have planes . 
  it does n't take more than 2 or 3 hours to get anywhere . 
  amsterdam is a really cool city to go to , but if you think it 's too `` touristy '' , you might wan na check out [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3hhtq1/some_places_in_the_netherlands_you_could_visit/ ) . 
  i 've seen plenty of international students traveling all around europe when they come here . 
  it 's perfectly acceptable to go to the balkans . 
  i 'd never heard of ` wier ' and ` dier ' , i always used ` wiens ' and ` diens ' no matter the gender !, 
   i know so many europeans that can rapidly tell me about x city in europe but as an american i 'm totally clueless . 
  but i may assume that if we ask about something related to american cities , you could answer it rapidly ? 
  right ? 
  i know a lot about european and dutch history ( i 'm dutch ) , but i have never had topics on the american revolution or anything in-depth about america/usa . 
  the only things i had in my classes were dutch involvement in the new world ( founding new york etc ) and the cold war between usa and ussr . 
  oh , and the aztecs were briefly covered as well , which was quite interesting . 
   it 's generally not looked down upon though here , to study history . 
  i 'm not studying it , but i like reading about it . 
  i often like to tell small history stories i know and while i am often afraid that i 'm boring people , they always ask me to keep going . 
  fun fact : people i met in asia told me they liked european history a lot more than asian history , because of all the different and diverse stuff that happened here . 
  in the netherlands , german people always expect you to speak german to them , they also always start conversations in german . 
  it 's rude as fuck . 
  please do n't do it . 
  some germans live in the netherlands for years and still do n't want to learn dutch even in the slightest bit . 
  ( or even english , i 've seen those people too ! ), 
  it makes you guys look very bad . 
  i rarely come to the tourist cities and then again , i live in one of the pickpocket-is-less-common-compared-to-the-rest-of-europe-countries ( the netherlands ) . 
  i do n't have any experience at all with getting robbed . 
  i always put my wallet and my phone in the side pockets of my pants . 
  back pockets are not a good idea , i think . 
  neither are the outside side-pockets of a jacket .
