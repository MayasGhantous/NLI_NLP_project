dutch , englishand and german are easy to follow . 
  i can read french pretty well . 
  i can read afrikaans and probably understand spoken afrikaans as well as long as they talk slowly . 
  and i recently discovered some danish is readable for me . 
  believe me , it 's terrible during tourist seasons . 
  way too crowded and way too hot . 
  despite it being a coastal city there 's no wind at all . 
  maastricht is definitely a great one day visit . 
  well , almost all pop songs use autotune . 
  but in these songs it 's a stylistic choice to make it sound so heavy , a trend that will fade away eventually . 
  ronnie is still really popular , lil kleine has n't really released a lot i think and polska is not really as popular as he used to be . 
  out of those three ronnie is definitely the most popular . 
  i do n't know in what we are ` kept quite ' . 
  freedom is such a broad concept that is really hard to define anyway . 
  i 've never been in the us but i ca n't imagine experiencing more freedom over in the us than i do here in the netherlands . 
  current dutch songs ( or songs with a dutch producer ) in our spotify top 50 , most of them are hiphop/electronic : [ ronnie flex - energie ( feat .

  this just goes to show how much dutch hiphop has changed since 4/5 years ago . 
  not at all representative for the current dutch hip hop scene . 
  still good songs nonetheless . 
  i do n't think russie is much of a threat . 
  i think the biggest threat to europe is turning against eachother ( for example brexit ) and falling apart . 
  that and global warming . 
  no i 've never been to our islands , i do n't think i would want to either . 
  way too hot for me . 
  they 're great danes !, 
  [ my dog and her brother ] ( http://i.imgur.com/edybsah.jpg ), 
  the chinese people at my university keep to themselves most of the time . 
  they only hang with other chinese people and only speak english when they have to ( in class ) . 
  my uni has an association for people from chinese descent as well . 
  children from older generation chinese people are often well integrated and overall really cool people . 
  also tunahan kuzu , famous for being considered to be a puppet of erdoghan . 
  him leaving his party and remaining in the parliament as his own party and some rather strange ideas towards racism . 
  another pretty controversial potentially upcoming politician is sylvana simons , known as a show host of television shows . 
  a lot of wilders supporters despise her and she has received multiple death threats and a lot of racist insults .

  i like the history behind venice , i 've read a lot before i went there . 
  that 's why it was such a let down for me . 
  i really hope they can do something to set the swindlers out of the city , that would definitely help a lot . 
  i 'm 1,76 whitch is pretty small in my country , sadly . 
  i really hate venice , it 's loaded with swindlers , the small streets are filled with tourists in the summer so you 'll move at a crawling pace in the burning heat , the only building worth seeing is the san marco and every restaurant is soooo fucking expensive you 'll have to bring all your grandmothers ' jewelry to pay . 
  on average the cheapest area to live is in noord-oost groningen . 
  the average price is 135.000 euros . 
  examples of ` cities ' are [ bellingwedde ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/gemeente+bellingwedde/@53.0680298,7.0724909,987m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xd93ea5a0e6fc7ed1!8m2!3d53.068966!4d7.0711238 ) , [ oude pekela ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/pekela/@53.1005412,6.9992872,2795m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47b7d56a69822e2b:0x54259bcab9216d5b!8m2!3d53.0852407!4d6.9778815 ) and [ winschoten ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/winschoten/@53.1413313,7.0229097,4690m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47b7d45109d865b5:0x78f240cfdd28f1db!8m2!3d53.1424984!4d7.0367877 ), 
  nope , we do have a lot of fairly big ( and old ) churches though . 
  that 's probably more a trend of rural netherlands i think ? 
  a lot of people have tiled ( ? ), 
  gardens where i live ( randstad ) with little strokes of different kinds of flowers at the sides . 
  there are a some differences between brand . 
  there are really sweet ones that are smooth and much more pleasant to eat ( imo ) and more ` peanutty ' ones . 
  so there might be one you like . 
  i think zwarte piet used to be a demon in the netherlands as well , until we figured the kids would like a friendly helper more . 
  i hate amsterdams and goois , they both sound so arrogant in a totally different way . 
  new album of one of the og dutch rappers ali b. 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqr1qtgu_i ) is an albumsampler , full album is on spotify . 
  i like the vilnius one better , it looks a lot cleaner . 
  both are pretty cool tho . 
  yes, 
  [ well , in the netherlands a lot of old , kinda ` white trash ' women color their hair and cut it short . 
  ] ( http://members.chello.nl/h.kuijpers25/kapsel/rood.jpg ) so it 's not a total strange concept but you will stick out ( just like you do in your own country ) . 
  also for occupying my country . 
  definitely more middle eastern than european . 
  but my opinion might be skewed by the turkish people living in my country who are generally from more conservative families . 
  vienna and prague are great , but i would n't go to venice especially in the summer . 
  it 's really crowded , full of swindlers and pretty boring overall . 
  ljubljana is a really nice city that 's close to croatia as well . 
  yeah , i picked a more popular current one . 
  but zwarte piet is probably the best example of a circlejerk . 
  fireworks will be next . 
  we will see after the march elections , i hope not . 
  with trump winning elections in the us and wilders potentially winning the election in the netherlands in march , the mainstream media debates with politicians if they have lost touch with our ` basket of deplorables ' ( the angry white men ) . 
  politics are n't based on facts anymore but who yells what you want to hear , even if the facts are n't there to prove the point . 
  a lot of elderly people feel that they are being picked on economically because of our retirement age changing ( from 65 to 67 , and will change more in the future , i will probably have to work until my 72nd ) and because they think that they are the poorest group of our society . 
  a lot of middle-aged white people are angry because of our changing traditions ( like zwarte piet ) , they are scared of muslim terrorists , a lot more people are against vaccinations ( including my mother , lol ) . 
  the general concensus is that these people will vote for wilders because he is the only one listening to this large group of people ( and some other parties like our elderly party ) . 
  this is a really popular subject now on television because i get the feeling that mainstream media do n't really want wilders to win this election , which strengthens the feelings of the ` angry white men ' in my opinion . 
  i know very little christians , i think i know more muslims . 
  but most of my friends are n't religious and do n't care about active atheism either . 
  about politicians not understanding the ` angry white men ' . 
  americans really like shitposting in this subreddit . 
  yeah there is a lot of rap , it is n't that mainstream tho . 
  they use a mixture of dutch/arabic/sranan / english/slang/more . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqzl7xmgkmc ) has been one of the most popular and more mainstream songs in the netherlands this summer . 
  waaien is a verb . 
  het waait ( the wind is blowing ( literally : it is blowing ) ) . 
  a breeze would be ` een bries ' . 
  i liked this on that i saw on television last night . 
  dutch has a lot of foreign words in it 's language which actually can make it easy/hard to learn our language : * sl ** oo ** t ( ditch ) * sl ** o ** ten ( ditches ) * crap ** aud ** ( some kind of chair ) * cad ** eau ** ( present ) * ** oi ** sterwijk ( a village in the netherlands ) * dep ** ot ** ( depot ) * s ** ou ** l ( soul ) * sh ** ow ** show ) * pern ** od ** ( a type of liquor ) * b ** oe ** ing ( a type of plane ) * ch ** au ** ffeur ( chauffeur ) * g ** oa ** l ( goal the bold parts are actually pronounced the same , which is kind of weird . 
  [ lets just send badr hari ] ( http://cdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/badr-hari-stance-1.jpg ) , i know he is n't the best anymore but at least he loves punching people . 
  and there is a chance he might not come back and in all honesty i wo n't miss him . 
  good luck badr !,
