i feel like i 'm repeating myself . 
  that 's a strange comparison . 
  wearing a mask somewhere out in the street during a protest is not the same as a large black cloth that does n't follow the body 's profile while in close vicinity to an important public servant , in a public building . 
  edit : and refusing the remove it , after being asked politely to multiple times . 
  it * is * harming someone because it 's setting a precedent . 
  a fully black clad individual is an extreme potential threat . 
  you `` let it slide '' and next week you have 2 of them , the week after that 6 , and the week after that people start realizing that 's a gloriously simple way to get anyone , carrying anything close enough to a mayor to do him harm . 
  maybe they never manage , but the threat of it will cause harm to freedoms more important than a full veil , and that just ca n't be allowed any wiggle room . 
  that 's a strange comparison . 
  getting the ol' chop-chop for within-error-margin speeding is categorically excessive , a 30k fine for compromising the security of a public building the mayor is present in is not . 
  i ca n't argue it 's not excessive , but you ca n't argue that it is . 
  a point ? 
  how do you figure ? 
  this was n't some random broad they picked up off the street to make an example of , she went to a council meeting , with a mayor ( a left-leaning one at that ) who asked her to identify herself . 
  break law -  get punished , no more to this . 
  `` how am i wrong ? '', 
  will be the start of any movement that wants to make it anywhere . 
  starting with an idea of what `` needs to be done '' is a great way to either fail or become what you 're setting out to destroy . 
  `` i 'm never right , just a little less wrong with every person i listen to '' . 
  `` here is my understanding , i challenge you to improve it '' . 
  i would pour heart and soul into a party for which that is the philosophy . 
  there is this amazing documentary called `` the power of myth '' , which discusses religion and myths throughout human history . 
  it really got me to appreciate how much you can learn from something or someone being wrong , never mind what you can get from someone who is right , which is not always you . 
  i know too little about policy to comment on any core needs , so i 'll be quiet on that front . 
  jehovah 's witnesses believe that once the west starts attacking religion , the end is upon us . 
  so if you see anything relating to the downfall of religion ... ... that 's when i 'll be hearing a lecture from my grandma , thoroughly wishing god would actually just smite me . 
  so you do n't have to answer for the committee you assign to oversee it in private . 
  like having your food cooked in front of you . 
  it 's not necessarily so you can judge , but so you 're comfortable in the knowledge that what you 're shoving down your gob was n't spat in . 
  i disagree . 
  i think people are looking at this backwards . 
  this is not * your * money yet . 
  this is not what you decide to do with it but what your customers or employer pay you . 
  that 's at the core . 
  where is this money going and what is it going there for ? 
  i 'd consider that a reasonable question to ask . 
  once the money is in your possession , no public eyes are on it . 
  where it goes from the private citizen 's bank account is nobody 's business unless he makes it so , but how it got there most certainly is . 
  there will be another after this , and another , and another . 
  reddit and twitter fist-shakers do n't have the attention span to care about the same thing for very long , which is why all they do is flick a switch to turn subreddits private or websites black for a day , then call their contribution a grand one , pat themselves on the back , and completely ignore the fact that this is the 19th fucking time they 've done it . 
   how did you come to that conclusion i was more comparing their tendencies to make rubbish claims about supporting democracy and human rights . 
  or well , just rubbish claims that everyone knows are rubbish claims . 
  he 's pretty much kim jong-un , except with leverage . 
  people dismissing turkey as a `` joke '' and claiming it will collapse seem to forget that last bit . 
   they debunk headlines that no-one took at face value anyway  no-one mate . 
  mate . 
  there 's * always * someone . 
  i 'd bet you money that if theguardian , theindependent , thedailymail or whatever garbage outlet published a story about eu legislature passing a law that would allow juncker to come into any british home and demand all the scones on the premises , enough people would take it at face value for clotted cream stock to wobble noticeably . 
  i genuinely wonder what the french think they have that makes them this openly narcissistic and petty . 
  i mean , the whole council is narcissistic and petty , but it always seems like the french are the only ones who believe they do n't have a reason to hide it like good little scummy politicians should . 
  i like that gif . 
  the guy is going mach 3 on a bike lane sandwiched between two rows of hinged steel day-ruiners , obviously he 's going to be dining on glass and asphalt . 
  it 's mostly the responsibility of the person in the vehicle , who is far less visible to the cyclist than the other way around , but it 's not all on them . 
  like if some biological jet-turbine whose quads seem to be so large they 've taken over the blood supply of the part of the brain that controls reason , the dramatic tumble this peddling bi-pedal takes is partly if not massively deserved . 
  i kid . 
  it 's just a part of driving here . 
  bikes are everywhere , so you are careful everywhere . 
  if they 're only sometimes a potential problem , people do n't sometimes care . 
  they never care . 
  anyone who does n't care about bikes in this country has their no-claim fucked right quick to educate them . 
  this is easily one of the best things i 've seen . 
  the most interesting thing i found is the correlation between [ this ] ( http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa-regio2.php?c2=society&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=11&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;button= ) map of church membership and [ this ] ( http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa-regio2.php?c2=society&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=14&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;map%5b%5d=&amp;button= ) one of political party membership . 
  denmark , the netherlands , finland and iceland spike massively in both . 
  when in rome ... 
  i 'm not even certain whether i 'm referring to acting like a tool because i 'm talking to a turk , or because i 'm on the internet . 
  i 'm going with the kuzco-defense . 
  that was too much response to nothing of substance . 
  welcome to the internet , you serious , serious turkey-man . 
   it 's not the first time a member of the government has been caught playing the game in the chamber g-gotta catch 'em all ? 
  \\* * runs away **, 
  wait , what ? 
  this is news ? 
  take a neat-o road trib with ya buds , ak 's in the trunk , allah down your throat , get your stupid ass arrested before you go 20 kilometers . 
  ... or put on raggedy clothes and waddle along with a couple thousand refugees . 
  this is like telling me most people commute to work by four-wheeled vehicle , * not * by going all mole-mode and digging tunnels barehanded . 
  the great connect . 
  i give it 2 days until the mexicans get so fed up with the weather they all waddle over to the coasts and paddle their country back across the atlantic . 
  by then all the brits will have died of heatstroke . 
   do n't waste them on some criminals in another country . 
  [ ... ]  it is ridiculous to ask all of us to invest so much care and attention into the causes of these few violent outliers . 
  [ ... ]  the only reason the public at large cares , is because they are dangerous . 
  [ ... ]  it is unreasonable to demand that we use the time and energy to empathize with them . 
  i do these things because i want to protect my family , not because i want to destroy terrorists . 
  that 's empathy at work , that 's why you 'd be forever running in circles , punishing terrorists with the harm already done , or failing as it does to keep them out with force , as the people you vehemently claim to want to protect keep suffering . 
  feel free to google around , see what effect invading a country ( mostly innocents , by the way . 
  funny how that works , right ? 
  ) , closing borders , punishing terrorists and tearing away at freedoms meant to defend you and me has had . 
  spoiler : it 's gotten worse , apparently on both sides . 
   in a more general sense there is no amount of suffering that can absolve the wrong doer from the harm done to a victim . 
  i never said it could , just that it 's a price paid , and it categorically is . 
   these attackers are such dangerous people , in a way a self immolater is n't . 
  never compared either one 's potential to inflict harm , just the reasoning that leads them to doing what they do . 
   empathy is n't necessary for all problems no , not just all problems , all , period . 
  empathy is why you 're here claiming you do n't need empathy . 
  empathy is why you 're * here * . 
  empathy is why you set your alarm , put on your pants , hose down your garden when it 's hot , pay speeding tickets and lock your door when you leave the house . 
  yet here you are , claiming you do n't need it to resolve a conflict that has half the world * emphatically * screaming and yelling to do what * they * are saying ? 
  please . 
  you are doing exactly what i said you should n't . 
  stop confusing understanding for sympathy .
