  stop implying they 're all psychopaths , they 're not , i know they 're not because they have a reason . 
  it 's a shit reason , it 's a harmful reason , i would even agree it makes them dangerous , but they 're driven by empathy , and claiming you do n't need it is going to make you lose , as evidenced by the number of species who have made it this far without it . 
  i never compared their causes , ideologies , or how righteous their methods , just that their reasoning eventually leads to their concluding that something like bombing a place , setting themselves on fire , hanging themselves from a roof beam , shooting up a school , hunger striking or any of numerous destructive methods are the only ways forward . 
   except they 're not paying the price . 
  instead they 're hiding . 
  that 's a price . 
  i genuinely believe if you look at such individuals like cowards , like they 're just out to intimidate and destroy , like `` animals '' and `` monsters '' , you start distancing yourself from them , losing out on a great aid to understanding . 
  the fact that you 're both human . 
  being a fugitive , being a prisoner , losing contact with family or friends , and ( since i utterly refuse to accept ** every ** one who would do something like this is a heartless psychopath ) a sense of guilt or regret or self-loathing , these * are * prices paid . 
  do not confuse understanding with sympathy ( as so often happens to people who see what they want to see , like how my last paragraph might seem like i feel bad for terrorists , if it were torn out of context ) . 
  you can understand and despise . 
  you do n't have to cuddle isis members and invite them into your home to understand * why * . 
  do not believe like a theist would that understanding the way a non-religious individual functions will somehow make you feel bad for them , like them , want to be similar to them . 
  you end up too far away to understand , never mind combat the aspects of them that are harming you . 
  not going to pretend to understand or call it reasonable , but drawing attention to something is at times the only thing a frustrated individual has the power to do , and he/she will pay any price for it . 
  think self-immolation . 
  and just for the record , `` talk '' , `` discussion '' , debate '' , `` discourse '' whatever you want to call it is not all it 's made out to be . 
  they 're very fancy and expensive tools , currently in the hands of shitflinging amateurs who would prefer to hack and smash their opponents work , rather than improve their own . 
  seeing your vote time and again end up with such parties and people can be extremely frustrating . 
   the 77 to 72 vote , while non-binding ** ha-ha ** !, 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement_referendum,_2016 ) is what happens to `` non-binding '' in the netherlands . 
  we 'll not hear a word about this again until some out-to-prove-himself newspaper intern in 2029 finds an article stashed away somewhere in a brown pile of notes and it gets shoehorned into a 3 panel comic on page 58 . 
  nah , you 're thinking of russel crowe . 
  someone from spain who speaks spanish is `` spanish guy '' , `` person who hates bulls '' or `` dude who sleeps when he should n't '', 
  someone send a spanish guy to communicate our appreciation . 
  spain ... ? 
  `` this shit '' is the vote-winner currently . 
  the discussion is n't going away before the `` shit '' , as it were . 
  amusing to see the countries who proposed this on [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9zlwyep.png ) little chart . 
  `` flexible solidarity '' in essence means `` you , not me '' to these people . 
   unless you 're retarted i 'm ** so ** retarted for you right now , oooh baby . 
  enjoy your little memento moment . 
  this selective memory erasing you do when it turns out your preposterous predictions yet again failed to come true . 
  and yes , that 's me saying neither of those things you said will happen . 
  it 's been a straight line through failures i can probably keep drawing decades into the future . 
  perhaps try finding balance , which , by the way , is what i was mocking , * not * the situations . 
  but reading comprehension is not a skill i 've come to expect from you doomsday proselytizers . 
  oh , and for the record , policy on immigration and refugees throughout europe is terrible and terrible and some more terrible . 
  i know with these extremes you jump to comes the blind projecting of your attitude onto everyone else , so i figured i 'd get ahead of your `` muslim lover '' insult . 
   do what i say otherwise earth will ** explode ** how do you people problem solve in your own lives if all your political solutions amount to `` choose my extreme or the other extreme ( always a complete catastrophe , regardless of which side you ask ) is * guaranteed * to happen '' ? 
  `` damn , i 'm out of food !, 
  i guess i either have to become a pig farmer or starve to death ! '', 
  `` damn , i 'm going over budget this month , i 'd better rob a bank or sell my house ! '', 
  `` damn , i 'm cold , i should move to the equator or set myself on fire ! '', 
   only the hungarians can decide , with whom they want to live together !, 
  yeah , i know , right ? 
  unfortunately you seem to forget that the rest of us also have this privilege ... wonder what 'll eat your country more . 
  refugees or solitude . 
   they can not make a decision over our heads which will influence our future in its core . 
  they can , and they do . 
  they just happen to be decisions that ** benefit ** you . 
  you seem not to have much of a problem with those . 
  please vote no . 
  please . 
  please give us more reason to reconsider this corrupt mess of an `` alliance '' . 
  same as summer food , except with coca cola replaced by coffee . 
  ca n't blame the man . 
  fungi fucking love circle jerks . 
  there would n't have been an issue in the first place without borders . 
  just saying . 
  there would n't have been an issue in the first place without the establishment of nation states . 
  just saying . 
  there would n't have been an issue in the first place without the fucking romans limiting free movement . 
  just saying . 
  there would n't have been an issue in the first place without the development of agriculture . 
  just saying . 
  there would n't have been an issue in the first place without those damn * sponges * and `` brains '' . 
  i think the answer is obvious , brothers , unite against animalia !, 
  unite against brains !, 
  \\* * absorbing of sunlight intensifies **, 
  i , sir , am going to hold to the formula of my life . 
  i 'm going to engage in an activity , and every minute i 'm going to regret that i 'm not doing something of more value , like so :  * self-loathing = ( ( number of times i felt regret ) + 1 ) * i will continue until * `` self-loathing '' * hits a variable * `` sobbing quietly point * '' , and i start contemplating my wasted existence , during which '' * self-loathing * '' grows exponentially until it diverges into * `` tears '' * and * `` anger * '' . 
  then i 'll do something i enjoy . 
  should be in a couple hours , by which time it 's gotten so late that i regret having wasted my time on this shit website , which makes me angrier . 
  my life is regret and anger . 
  [ source that is n't the worst sack of shit news outlet on earth ] ( https://www.westyorkshire.police.uk/news/appeal-after-polish-man-attacked-leeds ) . 
  fuck theguardian and their refusal to link sources . 
  i would n't trust them if they said the sun is coming up tomorrow . 
  [ yeah , europe is such a bastion of free speech ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-16-1937_en.htm ) good thing we have the telegraph to tell us about titty-censorship . 
  certainly focusing on the big issues to warrant that preposterous paywall . 
  i can just imagine the ... ` study ' that come up with this . 
  `` what do you want to bring back ? 
  slavery , or the death penalty ? '', 
  `` that 's , errrr ... that 's a terrible question but the death penalty i guess ? '', 
  `` alright , alright . 
  did you vote for or against brexit ? '', 
  `` i voted for bec ... '' `` breaking news , brexiters want people to die '' do n't think for a second this is beyond the independent . 
   girls at a private islamic school in stockholm are directed to the back door of a school bus while boys use the front door . 
  what ?!, 
  that is preposterous !, 
  how can they allow such inequality in today 's western world !? 
  the back is * objectively * the best half of the bus . 
  i demand they implement a rotation so the oppressed males of this school can get equal access to the comfy as fug backseat . 
  i genuinely hope political cartoons die a quiet death . 
  this comic explains nothing , teaches nothing , and argues , nothing nor does it bother to substantiate its implication . 
  it injects humor where facts should be and stupids everywhere confuse that bloat for substance . 
  these do more harm than good and society is better off without them and similar social commentary . 
  [ social commentary is worthless , manipulative and easy to make seem more legitimate than it is without ever being required to use facts , statistics , or general reason and logic .

  the children are fine , so long as they hand over their stroopwafels without incident .
