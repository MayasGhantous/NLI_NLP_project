  nice job saving face !, 
  `` hey why are we getting so few dutch and german tourists ? '', 
  `` we barred the fascists !, 
  yes !, 
  has nothing to do with the fact that despite turkey having been a massively popular holiday destination in the past , we 've turned into something of a hateful buncha shytes and scared all the stroopwafel chompers and beer guzzling madmen away !, 
  its cuz of sign ! '', 
  yeah , sure , alright . 
  just remember who keeps the rising sea levels out . 
  we 're good enuf wittem dams to flood the lot o ' ya shits . 
  take all of them for free , then pay the french 2.9 bil to come take the crappy part . 
  why is snoop dogg in ours ? 
  we have n't seen that guy since california legalized mj . 
  we keep sending representatives to contact mr. snoop but we get them back 6 months later in cornrows , high as a fucking kite screaming about laying low . 
  when we ask about the snoop visits they keep telling us to ... `` drop it like it 's hot '' . 
  this is a terrible title for a terrible article , and while i 'm not a big fan of censorship or the like it should be scoured from this otherwise good subreddit and condemned for its fallacious populist bullshit . 
  erdogan called the germans nazis and called my little nation `` nazi remnants '' . 
  i do n't care . 
  i 'm not insulted . 
  the man is a fool . 
  i * do * get upset when some absolute blubbery vagina who is supposedly on my side of the fence ( i like to pretend we 're not fools sometimes ... silly me ) starts not only doing the very thing we mocked erdogan for , but takes it a step further and brings up turkey 's history . 
  utterly . 
  irrelevant . 
  the closest i am tied to nazi atrocities is a grandfather with half a hand worth of fingers , so i 'll spare you crocodile tears , but to stoop so low as to use world war 2 era politics for shock value and viewer harvesting is beyond disgusting . 
  fuck this article . 
  if you had any doubts about dutchos keeping out ministers that are trying to gain the loyalty of the very people that you 'll have to worry about when erdogan stops talking and starts doing , this should fucking annihilate that . 
  nice job , erdy , by the way . 
  turks do n't have enough stigma and mistrust tied to them , now you just made every single one of them a question mark . 
  if turks in the eu do n't want their situation to quickly become an extremely uncomfortable one , i recommend they get together and tell erdogan to fuck right off . 
  i do n't want to sound nationalist , or like a fear monger , but at this point they 'll have to decide between expressing loyalty to their current host country , or to turkey , and silence in this particular scenario will make everyone assume - for their own safety - that you chose the latter . 
  i do n't want a transgender leader . 
  a good leader that happens to be transgender ? 
  sure . 
  the type that lets that sort of thing define them , though ? 
  i do n't want a ` transgender leader ' any more than i want a ` heterosexual leader ' . 
  i do n't care . 
  let them discuss sexuality in the tabloids , it does not belong in politics . 
  no heterosexual leader brings up his sexuality , ever . 
  it 's a non-issue . 
  even in political discourse where the theme is sexuality , the sexuality of any party is utterly irrelevant and should not be brought up whatsoever . 
  i know asking for it to just not be known is idealistic , but its about as relevant as whether or not a politician considers pineapples a valid pizza topping , and i 'm not even exaggerating . 
  edit : nice job , finland . 
  give us a workout at least , wouldya ? 
   the full list of the world 's worst tax havens , in order of significance are : ( 1 ) bermuda ( 2 ) the cayman islands ( 3 ) the netherlands it 's nice that they 're so comfy with our tax haven , all the while i 've stopped buying things in this country and have everything [ shipped in from germany and the uk at 2/3 the price ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q81rzpe.jpg ) . 
  yes . 
  i can ship that thing over here for 27 pounds and at the current conversion rate i will save ** two hundred and fifty euros ** . 
  no , this is not some temporary mega-deal . 
  it 's been like this for months . 
  if i start comparing the price of tools here to their * identical * counterparts in the us i generally [ go fetal ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5k8nigj.jpg ) and do n't leave my bed until i 'm dehydrated enough to be incapable of producing lacrimal fluid .

   turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu criticized german and dutch restrictions on such gatherings as undemocratic pot , pls stop . 
  reported for not labeling nsfw picture . 
  that 's good . 
  i 'm the same sex i was before and would n't want to be a criminal in finland or nuthn . 
  i 'm a thirty year old virgin living with my mother . 
  you think i 'm joking . 
  being judged an insecure teenager by someone incapable of forming a single coherent sentence does wonders for my self-image , though . 
  could you explain the toddler-esque reasoning that led you to deduce that from what i wrote ? 
  allowing same-sex marriage is apparently quite an upvote-magnet !, 
  i just want to make it clear that if anyone opts to get same-sex-married in my immediate vicinity , i have the power to stop it , and there 's nobody to keep me from exercising this power , i would most definitely allow it . 
  i 'd allow the fuck out of it . 
  i 'd probably give a little applause , maybe throw some rice if it 's in reach . 
  would slovenia applaud ? 
  shit no . 
  upvote behenk . 
  edit : was n't downplaying the change , mocking the post or whoring . 
  i 'd apologize , but my only failure was assuming reading comprehension here was n't at the level of a third grader at the bad end of the intellectual bell-curve . 
  my sky-beard has ordered me to engage in ritualistic burning of pagan religion 's literature . 
  to condemn me for doing so is to condemn my lord , blasphemy by all relevant standards . 
   for am i now seeking the approval of man , or of sky-beard ? 
  or am i trying to please man ? 
  if i were still trying to please man , i would not be a servant of sky-beard . 
  my recommendation : burn this law . 
  make a new one that excludes multi-millionaires , billionaires and multi-billionaires . 
  i want to see that `` make more money '' lie go away and sink into deep red . 
  well shit . 
  looks like you could make some money then , eh ? 
  i mean , people would be lining up for your superior , imported product . 
  right ? 
  ** right ?!, 
  ** this is a self-solving problem . 
  or it would be , if it was a problem to begin with . 
  i know , right ? 
  by all me downvotes you 'd think this was a massive hole in the market !, 
  irrelevant . 
   they picked various kinds of food , including dairy , meat and fish products , chocolates , baked goods , cheese and drinks . 
  as well as checking the packaging , including information about the composition and weight in grams , they also analysed the colour , flavour and smell . 
  yeah , also half the price . 
  it 's called cost of living and i would be careful what you wish for , unless you suddenly get it and pay twice the price .
