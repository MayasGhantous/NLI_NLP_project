rip in peace unidan . 
  i can only read a little of that : s no offense , but your writing actually reminded me of the paper guy fawkes wrote his signature on , after he was tortured into confessing his crimes . 
  [ here it is . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guy_fawkes#torture ), 
  right now iceland and belarus make up 32 % of the votes ** each ** . 
  something 's fishy . . vatican city : 750 votes , and it has a population of 842 . 
  they 're both correct , but it 's like you said , ` houd ' is more formal , so ` ik hou van je ' is just much more common . 
  but it 's generally safe right ? 
  it 's probably because of increased cooperation and trade . 
  what makes you think they hate the west ? 
  probably california , washington , or one of the smaller northeastern states . 
  am i right in thinking that they seem the most progressive ? 
  it 's just what i learned about the us on reddit and the internet :p first choice would be tough , either new york or california . 
  i like areas and cities with lots of different people ( ethnicities ) . 
  wilders ' popularity mostly ( i hope ) comes from ignorant people who 've never had any contact with foreigners , and base their opinions from watching the news . 
  the recession and people losing their jobs also played a role i think . 
  but in my experience , dutch society shames people who discriminate based on gender , ethnic background , sexual orientation , etc. 
  wilders does make us look bad , but he 's not a representative of all dutch people , he 's just very vocal about his opinions , which he 's allowed to have ( very important ) . 
  well the [ hdi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) of the nl is pretty high up there , and people know that , but you 're right , we do have our internal issues . 
  which countries are we way behind of though ? 
  the us ? 
  we 're still doing pretty good i think . 
  exactly . 
  i think if i was gay and i lived in saudi arabia or pakistan or something , i 'd very much want to live here . 
  there are other countries that are also more lgbt-friendly than most of the world of course , such as germany , scandinavia , france , nz , australia , canada , etc. 
  we 're not there yet , but we 're a big step in the right direction , 
  that it 's a not very religious , highly developed country that pretty much has its shit together . 
  that and weed , prostitutes , and gay rights . 
  the first part is true , but weed and prostitutes are more of a tourist thing than a dutch thing . 
  i 'm proud that this country is one of the most accepting for lgbt people . 
  so if a 2nd generation son of an immigrant was convicted of battery for getting into a fight , he would get deported ? 
  getting deported for a crime a native would get a couple days in jail , a fine , or some community service for , sounds a little extreme to me . 
  where would it stop ? 
  would this count for the grandchildren of an immigrant , who are completely westernized ? 
  what about 2nd/3rd generations who only have one passport ? 
  because i do n't think one can be made stateless . 
  love that stuff . 
  here 's a guy who learned to do it , best part at 1:07 . 
  trying to learn it myself but it 's hard to get the whistling sound :p https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zzaint9v6q, 
   it 's pretty common to be circumcised in america regardless of religion . 
  i 'm not actually sure why . 
  there are a couple reasons . 
  first it was to stop kids from masturbating , and then there 's the myth that it 's cleaner or that it reduces the chance of contracting hiv , and there 's also peer/social pressure . 
  `` i 'm circumcized so so should my son . '', 
  the us is huge though , so it 's different per region . 
  it 's the lowest in the west , and urban areas tend to have lower circumcision rates than rural areas . 
  http://www.circumstitions.com/usa.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_circumcision#united_states, 
  if you 're counting out ancient and medieval times , sure europe was the most powerful . 
  ... ... is this reddit , or stormfront ? 
  he says perkele a lot :p, 
  yeah the second one looks more like a regular photo . 
  sorry i do n't have pics , it looked like [ this ] ( http://cache.entouriste.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/starry-skies-in-the-mingsha-sand-dunes.jpg ) . 
  i do n't think i saw the milky way , but the sky was lit up with stars it was amazing to see . 
  it was from the grasslands btw . 
  it 's very different from my home city where i ca n't even see a single star if i look up :( i miss it now . 
  looks amazing , but are you sure it 's not long exposure or something ? 
  i 've been to a pretty desolate place at night ( inner mongolia , china ) and it looked quite different from that . 
  disagreed . 
  so am i , it 's not like it 's hard to look this stuff up . 
  well you said 6 foot , which is 183cm , which is above average . . 
  [ found this ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/ ) . 
  although it excludes a lot of countries you can still see a big regional gap between the countries that were surveyed , russia being the elephant in the room . 
  views on homosexuality in the balkans is probably similar as in russia , if not worse . 
  if you [ google ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albania-is-the-most-homophobic-country-in-europe-survey-says ) around [ a bit ] ( http://www.yorkvision.co.uk/features/the-hunt-has-begun-death-to-homosexuals/29/05/2012 ) you 'll [ probably ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/valerie-hopkins/lgbt-violence-in-balkans ) get the [ same idea ] ( http://www.balkantravellers.com/en/read/article/643 ) . 
  different per region i 'd say . 
  quite accepting in northern/western/central and southern europe , much less so in eastern europe and the balkans . 
   i 'm 6 foot . 
  i 'm shorter than the average dutch person . 
  taller actually , the average is 181cm ( 5 ' 11 ) , you 're 183cm :p, 
  there 's probably a lot of extra security around the airport :p, 
   the very point that you appear to have missed is that the netherlands is notorious for being well-versed in languages , and offering great sources to learn these languages . 
  no , i got that , and i disagree . 
  i think you 're greatly exaggerating how `` notorious '' the netherlands is , and how well-versed dutch people are in multiple languages . 
  i 'm guessing you 're dutch so there 's probably some bias there . 
  if the dutch are notorious for anything language related , it 's probably [ dunglish ] ( http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2015/04/08/dunglish-27-funny-examples-that-will-make-you-laugh-out-loud/ ) . 
  most if not all developed countries offer great sources to learn languages , that 's not something special . 
   this is not some anecdotal evidence . 
  funny you should say that , considering you said `` i have met plenty of dutch people who are fluent in german or french . '', 
  just before , which is anecdotal evidence . 
   this is something that dutch people are known for . 
  says who ? 
  when i think of countries with many spoken languages , i do n't think of the dutch , i think of india or luxembourg . 
  you can have that opinion though . 
   just because you could say the opposite , does n't erase that fact . 
  you have n't even provided any evidence so far for your claims , so you might want to avoid calling it a fact just yet . 
  and please , nothing self-reported . 
   ` often times ' does mean a lot , but it does n't mean most or all . 
  alright so you do mean a lot , which is also still just what you think , not what you know . 
   even if i replaced it and said , `` a lot of dutch people are also fluent in french and german '' that statement would still be completely valid . 
  yes , because that 's completely vague . 
  `` a lot of dutch people '' can mean 10,000 people and it can mean 10 million . 
   especially in comparison to other countries , the netherlands is a well-versed nation . 
  another vague statement . 
  yes , to `` other countries '' such as the us or uk the netherlands is a well-versed nation , compared to other `` other countries '' it 's not really that special . 
  i did n't say you said every time . 
  often times does sound like a lot , i 'm sure you can see that . 
  the bit i quoted ( that most people are often times fluent in french and german ) is a bit of a vague statement in the first place , but it still sounds like an exaggeration . 
   i have met plenty of dutch people who are fluent in german or french . 
  okay ? 
  i can say the opposite , it does n't prove much .
