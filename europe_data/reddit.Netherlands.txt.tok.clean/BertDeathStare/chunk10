   they do n't even terrorize their state , yet they 're met with violence and discrimination . 
  uwot ?

  i do n't think you 'd like it if someone from china said `` there have never been terrorist attacks by kurds in turkey , yet they 're discriminated against . '', 
  yes , let 's all declare war on the netherlands . . 
  if we 're going down we 're taking belgium down with us !, 
  this test was online and people had to sign up for it , so i think it was mostly done by young people who were confident enough of their english skills to take the test . 
  it does n't really represent the average person . 
  if the entire population was tested , i seriously doubt poland or serbia would score high , among others . 
   just shows how divisive multi-culturalism really is . 
  it 's 100 protestors , you 're blowing it out of proportion . 
  20 far-right `` counterprotestors '' came as well , do we have a problem with the far-right now ? 
  no , we do n't . 
  we have millions of non-ethnic dutch people in the netherlands , the vast majority of whom celebrate sinterklaas without any issues . 
  ah my mistake , sorry . 
  i thought abbadon64 complained about downvotes , but he was quoting raven1005 . 
  or people downvote because maybe sweden has a broader definition of certain crimes , and a higher level of reporting . 
  india has a very low rape rate , now does that mean it 's actually safer for women than sweden , or could there be other reasons ? 
  i think that would be a good way to do it , let them find out themselves ( the topic will probably come up as early as primary school ) and they 'll ask questions if they feel like it . 
  kids are smarter than we give them credit for . 
   would n't you prefer it by that reasoning , if you raised your child well ( according to your system of belief ) then your child could help an unborn kid by marrying a moderate enough religious person ( do n't think they 'd marry a zealot if they 're atheist ) and agreeing not to raise them religiously ( at least 'till a certain age ) well i 'd have no problem with my son/daughter marrying a religious person if they did n't raise the kids religiously . 
  but i feel like we 're stretching the what-ifs a bit far when talking about other people 's unborn children . 
  at the end of the day it 's the choice of the parents how they want to raise them , even though i might disagree with it , or find it plain repulsive ( not saying raising kids religiously is repulsive , but other things like smoking in the house with the kids inside is ) . 
  i think most religious people do raise their kids religiously though , some more strictly than others , so if i was asked the question i 'm not going to have a hard time answering . 
   feels like indoctrination indoctrination archaic : teaching ; instruction it is indoctrination , but hardly anything is n't in the raising of a child . 
  that definition is archaic ( old , outdated ) , a better definition is : [ the process of teaching a person or group to accept a set of beliefs uncritically . 
  ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/indoctrination ) i think there are better ways to teach children about religion . 
  like teaching them about all the major religions and philosophical systems ( they often have similarities ) , what they 're about , how they came to be , etc. 
  but not `` you are x religion , you should believe in this and that , and pray with us at this time '' etc. 
  that 's the big difference between teaching and indoctrinating . 
  also there 's the question of grandchildren . 
  you 'd want the best for them , so if your son/daughter married a religious person , would that person then want to raise them in that religion ? 
  i find it weird to teach a young child `` you are x religion '' for years , feels like indoctrination . 
  they would n't be * my * children of course , but if asked for a preference it 's not a hard choice between religious or non-religious . 
  i think it 's different for jews , pretty much everyone from any european country knows what they 've been through as a group not very long ago . 
  they 're also a tiny minority and not threatening in any way . 
  on the other hand a lot of people do n't know anything about black people/muslims/asians , and only get their knowledge about them from tv . 
  or they misunderstand what asian means , they think pakistan or iran , which they might have a problem with , but not with chinese or koreans . 
  it 's still surprising it 's so low in czechia so much though , because all of this can apply to the rest of europe as well . 
  join us . 
  one of us !, 
  one of us !, 
  to new citizens we give 10 eggs as a welcome present . 
   waste less money and lose less power on the global stage , prevent outside forces from dividing nations against each other . 
  be quicker to prevent parallel policies or divisions disabling our ability to make decisions on important subjects ( like energy , immigration , ecology ) . 
  how would this happen on the scale of a federation ? 
  would we have our own elections for parties or would it come down to a giant federation-wide vote ? 
  because if we have our own elections and votes , how would that be any different from the current situation ? 
  but if we have a giant vote on everything , i think that would leave a lot of people upset with that system , because european countries are quite different from eachother , much more than us states , and more so the farther you go from each country . 
  i do n't think that would be a very stable federation . 
   that last one may seem weird to you as a dutchman , but do n't forget we have member states whose people faced displacement and eradication . 
  i understand that and keep that in mind , but we can protect eachother as eu members , and with nato . 
  there needs to be more cooperation and more spending though . 
   it 's not that i disagree with you , but how do you see this happen ? 
  can you give examples how you imagine this would happen ? 
  well i was thinking through elections , but if we 're going the us style way , what 's the point ? 
  if we 're all basically keeping our own laws and elections , surely what we plan to do as a federation can be accomplished with the eu ? 
  but then what 's the point of the federation ? 
  if we 're going to keep our own laws and local elections , surely what we plan to do inside a federation can be done with the eu ? 
  i 'm very pro-eu and i 'd like to see more cooperation , especially on a military level , but becoming a single nation is too much for me . 
  i like my country the way it is , but we are small and i worry that in a federation the larger provinces/states would influence and change us too much , possibly in a negative way . 
  like how would a federation affect the laws of countries ? 
  some allow gay marriage , others do n't . 
  some have more protection and rights for the media than others . 
  some allow abortion on request , some do n't . 
  if it came down to a federation-wide majority vote , i think that would leave a lot of people frustrated , we 're simply too different . 
  for the foreseeable future i 'd rather stay independent but still work together . 
  nice generalization . . you think his behavior is normal in we ? 
  he 's just an asshole employer , they exist everywhere . 
  if this happened here and it was caught on video he 'd probably be making a public apology the next morning . 
  i was clearly talking about income inequality when i said `` it 's pretty bad in the us '' . 
   i guess the only explanation is that some people earn very much to pull up the numbers of the average , right ? 
  yes , but it 's worse in [ some countries than others ] ( https://data.oecd.org/inequality/income-inequality.htm ) . 
  it 's pretty bad in the us , [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpkkqnijnsm ) explains it well . 
  median is a more accurate portrayal of the whole population imo , it 's also useful to take the living costs into account ( higher education and healthcare is more affordable in denmark than the us ) . 
  the difference in working hours make a substantial difference as well . 
  it 's `` a nonsense '' ? 
  why is that ? 
  they explain the percentages :  this is a list of countries or dependencies by income inequality metrics , including gini coefficients . 
  the gini coefficient is a number between 0 and 1 , where 0 corresponds with perfect equality ( where everyone has the same income ) and 1 corresponds with perfect inequality ( where one person has all the income -- and everyone else has zero income ) . 
  income distribution can vary greatly from wealth distribution in a country ( see list of countries by distribution of wealth ) . 
  want a different source ? 
  https://data.oecd.org/inequality/income-inequality.htm http://www.businessinsider.com/ranked-income-inequality-around-the-world-2015-7?international=true&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t, 
  [ income inequality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) is worse in some countries than others , is n't it understandable to take that into consideration ? 
  average income takes a dive when you switch to median , for some countries more than others . 
  for the us it 's because it has a small percentage of extremely wealthy individuals who pull up the average , but then that average does n't actually paint an accurate picture of how much the vast majority of americans earn . 
  here 's [ median income ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) , also keep in mind that americans [ work more hours ] ( https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=anhrs ) than all the countries above it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income right below denmark even though americans on average [ work a lot more hours ] ( https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=anhrs ) than danes ; 1783 hours a year vs 1410 for denmark . 
  even taking that into consideration , a cat/dog that 's suffering from a painful and uncurable illness can be euthanized , but a human being will not even be given that option in the vast majority of countries . 
  whether you 're rich or poor , or suffering from some painful illness or not , it 's not even a possibility , that 's what bothers me . 
  if a cat or a dog is suffering people have no issues deciding for the pet and putting it down , but if a human being is suffering somehow it 's wrong and they 're not allowed to decide for themselves . 
  what 's left for them is to either keep suffering , or to do the job themselves . 
  when they do it themselves it 's often an undignified and violent death , which sometimes also traumatizes strangers ( like train operators and witnesses ) . 
  we can be critical of the past without self-loathing , especially considering it was not us who did those things . 
  human history is full of horrible things , and i have a negative opinion on a lot of historical figures from many different countries . 
  btw that pic was n't exactly the norm in the americas , the cruelty of the aztecs is one of the main reasons why some native tribes allied with the spanish . 
  xenophobia means having a dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries , and i think it applies to this pretty well because banning every ethnic minority is prejudice . 
  also how is banning ethnic minorities criticism ? 
   i wonder how many people would still be alive if this rule was applied to the bataclan . 
  how would an ethnic minority ban have made any difference ?
