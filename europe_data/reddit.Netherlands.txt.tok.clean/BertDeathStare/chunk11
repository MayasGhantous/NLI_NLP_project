  you think a couple of bouncers would 've stopped armed men ? 
  belarus is surprisingly high . 
  but the children and grandchildren of the religiously conservative can become secular too . 
  the vast majority of french/swedish/dutch / german/british etc were christian before too , but younger generations are more and more likely to identify as agnostic/atheist . 
  well that 's understandable with those mountains and low population density . 
  1600s does sound late though , no roads were built during the middle ages ? 
  if the romans truly wanted to take ireland/scotland/norway they probably could 've , but it was n't worth it to them . 
  these areas had little to offer to them , even taking britain was just a drain on their resources and gave them little in return . 
  their empire was large enough as it was , with much land to control and many borders to protect , but given the political will i do n't doubt they could 've conquered more land than they had . 
  `` barbarians '' rarely gave them trouble in battle anyway , they had far more trouble with `` civilized '' professional armies like the carthaginians or the parthians . 
  not very cold , it says in 2014 the water was 8c , on that 10k beach . 
  well we have [ this ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/nieuwjaarsduik ) every january , in 2014 there were 10k participants on the same beach . 
  somehow we just need to convince them to go naked . 
  how about [ $ 877,255.49 ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejr1h5tf5we&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=14s ), 
  he always looks so grumpy . 
  at 2:54 for a while i thought he was speaking german but the words just sounded similar to dutch , like they often do . 
  pretty cool that he learned dutch , usually it 's the other way around . 
  i never claimed they 're equal . 
  i merely gave you information , which you asked for , that shows that eastern europeans are n't so far behind muslims on their views towards homosexuality , which was what the op said . 
  you first tried to change it to legal status , and now you 're trying to change it to `` worst thing they can do to gays '' , neither of which is what the op said . 
  you asked for evidence , i gave you evidence . 
  you then moved the goalpost to legal status , even though he was clearly talking about social views , and you 're now trying to bullshit your way out by calling it semantics , even though i already explained to you why it 's not semantics . 
  you keep saying you 're not interested in debating it , yet you keep responding . 
  it seems to me that you ca n't actually argue why you think it 's semantics , you 're just calling it that because you 're unwilling to admit eastern europeans are n't so far behind muslims on their views towards homosexuals . 
  talking with you feels a lot [ like this ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/pigeon_chess ) . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  what semantics ? 
  he was clearly talking about the views of muslims towards homosexuals compared to the views of eastern europeans towards homosexuals . . 
  i gave you sources that compare those views . . legal status and social views are different things , it 's not semantics . 
  if he meant legal status he would 've said so . 
  now you 've changed it to the legal status , that 's something different from what he said :  the views of british muslims are n't so far behind those of some eastern europeans in terms of levels of acceptance . 
  i showed you the views of eastern europeans . 
  i 'm not the one you asked , but on social acceptance i could only find this from 2013 : [ ` should society accept homosexuality ? 
  ' ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/ ) they excluded a ton of countries though . 
  the only european country that was surveyed and also scored very low was russia . 
  it 's probably a similar number in belarus , moldova , and ukraine , maybe even lower than russia 's 16 % . 
  i would presume some of the balkan countries to score pretty low too , maybe not as low as russia , but somewhere in between russia and poland maybe . 
  i base that presumption on [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wdokimq.png?1 ) . 
  suddenly it feels much worse when you see their faces , the kids especially . . 
  such a broad statement is rarely accurate for any subject . 
  you 're from the us so let me give you an american example ; the anti-war movement of the [ vietnam war . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opposition_to_united_states_involvement_in_the_vietnam_war#effects ) you do n't think this mass opposition and its protests helped shape public opinion towards the war ? 
  that it did n't put pressure on the us government ? 
  or an example from my country , the [ protests ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/05/amsterdam-bicycle-capital-world-transport-cycling-kindermoord ) against road traffic fatalities , which helped convince the government to create better and safer infrastructure for cycling . 
  protests do n't always work , but to say they 've never led to anything meaningful is wrong . 
  yep , i do n't know whether to laugh at them or feel sad for them . 
   which is why i suggested the army to supplement the overwhelmed police force . 
  or they just get help from police departments of other states . 
  not sure why you think it 's better to send the army anyway , the army is n't trained for riot control like the riot police is . 
  they * do n't even know when they 're allowed to arrest someone or how to do it . 
   when there are national emergencies , it is normal for countries to send in the army to help . 
  ( e.g. 
  earthquake , flood , or in the hilarious case of toronto ... snow ) [ as this person already told you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lsao3/antig20_protests_descend_hamburg_streets_into/djwdw92/ ) the german army can help in case of natural disaster of emergency , but this is neither of that . 
  these are protests and riots , which the riot police are equipped and trained for . 
  if every riot was a national emergency then germany ( and many europeans countries ) would be in a state of emergency all the time because of football hooligans . 
  maybe they 're making their way over ? 
  the police ca n't teleport in front of them , there are logistics involved in getting a large enough police force to a large group of moving rioters . 
  as others [ have said ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lsao3/antig20_protests_descend_hamburg_streets_into/djwe9gb/ ) there are also multiple protests/riots across the city which all need a police presence . 
  in fact the police was so overwhelmed that other states [ had to send backup ] ( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-germany-protests-iduskbn19s1ba?il=0 ) . 
  the german police are clearly doing the best they can as you can see in the [ op video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chxz7d8d-zm ) . 
  an army ? 
  without guns ? 
  from where are they invading ? 
  i find your comment a bit ridiculous tbh . 
  it 's an organized riot , nothing more , and that 's a job for the riot police to deal with . 
  maybe they do ? 
  they 're not going to wear armor and form lines in the streets though , that 's what we have riot police for . 
  riot police have to show up for the far-right too , whether it 's a peaceful protest or a riot . 
  riot police usually deals with them . 
  if they 're not killing people and as long as the police can handle it , the army will stay out of it . 
  if the army had to be called in for every riot you 'd need the army preventatively outside football stadiums all the time , but that 's what the riot police is for . 
  cars do n't really explode outside of movies btw . 
  ok thanks , 
  ok thanks that 's good to hear, 
  is the dutch police officer 's german easily understandable ? 
   the shortest way i always saw that ~  religious `` know '' that there is a god . 
   atheists `` know '' that there is no god . 
   agnostics `` do n't know '' whether there is a god . 
  you can be both though . 
  atheism/theism refers to the belief , agnosticism/gnosticism refers to knowledge . 
  [ helpful chart . 
  ] ( http://www.ben-kay.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jq513f8689.png ) there 's also the [ `` dawkin 's scale '' . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/the_knowledge-belief_chart_and_dawkins'_scale.png ) most atheists are probably a 6 , aka agnostic atheist ; has no belief in god , but does n't claim to know 100 % sure god does n't exist . 
  i just went to a random time and got to 48:05 , that whole scene just made me laugh but the best part was at 49:15 when he grabbed her arm and the music started playing . 
  it it a romance drama series or something ? 
  all these types of series seem to look the same no matter what country they 're from lol . 
  the guy with the red cap , his head looks way too big for his body . 
  in a videogame that building would be a hospital , just needs a helipad ontop with a red + on it . 
  the ghost city stuff is a bit overblown though . 
  some of those cities were photographed before they were completed ( you might call it propaganda ) , and tons of those `` ghost cities '' are highly populated now . 
  it 's better to anticipate the millions that move to urban areas , than do nothing and get slums in existing cities because there are n't enough buildings to house them . 
  german is too similar sometimes . 
  this is so unlucky . 
  i really hope that germany can make renewable resources work really well . 
  gib mountain, 
  lol yeah i 'm sure there are many kinds of leverworst too , i 'm not an expert though , do n't find it very tasty myself :p, 
  ah , [ this ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=leverworst&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewigyty0wnfuahwoy1akhbvoc5kq_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950 ) is leverworst here , pretty much the same as pastei/pat \u00e9 only a bit harder . 
  we have leverpastei/pat \u00e9 too , but it 's the stuff you smear on your bread with a knife . 
   many had anticipated the events and escaped by sea .
