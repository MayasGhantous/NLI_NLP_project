  the ensuing massacre was indiscriminate : neither women nor children were spared , and latin patients lying in hospital beds were murdered . 
  houses , churches , and charities were looted . 
  latin clergymen received special attention , and cardinal john , the papal legate , was beheaded and his head was dragged through the streets at the tail of a dog . 
  brutal reminder what humans are capable of . . 
  these reminders are frequent when reading history . 
  he probably means chemical castration , which some countries use on convicted rapists and/or child molesters . 
  it 's not as bad as it sounds , the dick is n't burned off or anything , it 's just a drug they take that reduces libido . 
  the libido levels return to normal when they stop taking it . 
  some countries do it forcibly and some give the convict a choice ; take it and your sentenced will be reduced , but they probably have to keep taking it after their release . 
  that 's true , though most troops back then were n't very heavily armored . 
  it was used a lot in defensive sieges as well from what i 'm reading . 
  very easy to use and 10 men with a repeating crossbow could fire 100 bolts per minute . 
  40,000 crossbowmen , that 's got ta be terrifying to fight against , just thousands of bolts flying into your direction . 
  i 've read that crossbows back then also packed quite a punch , so much that they could penetrate shields and armor of the time . 
  later when the repeating crossbow was invented they would dip the bolts in aconite poison , making them even more lethal . 
  not that leaving the eu will stop the dm from blaming the eu though . 
  worst part is that their readers will believe it too . 
  maybe there were multiple posts ? 
  there 's one on the front page right now for worldnews : https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/6huv4i/muslim_peace_march_held_in_germany_but_turnout/ does n't explain / r/news though . 
  georgian always reminds me of the emojis \u10da ( \u0ca0\u76ca\u0ca0 ) \u10da, 
  look at his teeth , that 's definitely a romanian . 
  too hot . 
  thought that was a real tweet of his until i saw the url . . 
  all spaniards and portuguese should just go to andorra and wait it out there . 
  might be a little crowded but at least you 'll survive . 
  not at all , considering i said i only provided links for you to read , and did n't want to go through it all myself . 
  you asked for info , i gave you info , be glad i did that instead of just ignoring you like i should have . 
  i was never wrong about anything i said anyway , since i did n't claim every single person in those lists were killed by the kremlin , so it does n't matter whether i read it or not . 
  i just took a quick google and linked it to you , since you were too lazy to do it yourself . 
  not that you did n't know about all the dead journalists and politicians though , you just act ignorant/dumb like all russian nationalists/trolls . 
  you nitpicking one man out of many does n't change much , it 's quite possible he was murdered by the kremlin , just like it 's possible he was murdered by berezovsky , we ca n't know for sure because no one was prosecuted . 
  we do know that russia is still a shithole for journalists and politicians who do n't roll over for putin , and it 's an even bigger shithole for journalists who openly criticize him and politicians who oppose him . 
  the dangerous kind of authoritarian shithole . 
  btw you might not realise this , but i did n't write those links , i just gave you links because you wanted information so you could read up on it yourself . 
  if you have a problem with that particular article then take it up with the writer . 
  i 'm not even going to bother reading your next reply , i already know it 's garbage . 
  go collect your rubles . 
  he may or may not have been murdered by berezovskiy , he did n't * only * report on him . 
   ` klebnikov joined the forbes in 1989 and gained a reputation for investigating murky post-soviet business dealings and corruption . ', 
  corruption runs deep in the kremlin . 
   ` in the same year , klebnikov was chosen to be the first editor of the russian edition of forbes . 
  because his wife and children did not wish to move to russia , klebnikov agreed with them that he would take the post for only one year . 
  the magazine only put out four issues before his death , including an article covering russia 's 100 wealthiest individuals , which some commentators speculate may have been the reason for his death . ', 
  it 's in the wiki link if you bothered to read . 
   surely i am not the one trolling here ? 
  seems like you are tbh . 
  this is just a waste of my time now , this is probably my last response . 
  because it 's usually russian nationalists who act naive and dumbfounded that journalists like klebnikov could be murdered by the kremlin . 
  other europeans are pretty aware of the risk putin critics take , even non-europeans in the us , canada , australia know . 
  i must say you ask a lot of dumb questions , this is why i thought you were joking/trolling . 
  let me guess , your next response will be `` why dumb questions ? '', 
  and then i 'll tell you why . 
  and the one after that : `` what do my dumb questions have to do with my supposed nationality ? '', 
  lol . 
  not sure if serious . 
  because you ask for more info , i give you more info , you react surprised seeing one particular name , and when i give you info on that you act like his criticisms of the kremlin could n't be a reason for his death . 
  so he may have been killed for that . 
  what 's your deal ? 
  why are you trying to get into an argument here ? 
  are you russian or ? 
  where did you see him ? 
  do n't know the exact number , but it 's certainly a lot more dangerous to be a putin critic in russia or a political opponent than in most other european countries . 
  i 'd say the most , but i honestly do n't know enough about the situation in belarus and turkey to say that , though in belarus they probably do n't get to say anything to begin with . 
  i should 've said jailed too , probably more than any are simply [ jailed and/or silenced . 
  ] ( https://rsf.org/en/russia ) you can start looking though , if you read about the people who died and what they did , often enough they were critics of putin or exposing the corruption of the kremlin in some way . 
  note that in the articles below there will be names repeated , but some articles mention names that others do n't have . 
  just do n't want to go through all that myself sorry :p https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:assassinated_russian_politicians http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/heres-a-list-of-all-the-putin-critics-who-wound-up-murdered/news-story/4e2952b107b0c7159887e303062c9694 https://extranewsfeed.com/the-trail-of-dead-russians-da27ee4a2bdc https://www.rte.ie/news/special-reports/2015/0228/683548-list-of-dead-kremlin-critics/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia, 
  the uk is certainly democratic , vastly more so than russia , but i think even the uk [ can improve ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1xuhdfk.jpg ) . 
  i read some of your other comments and i think it 's admirable that you want to change russia for the better , but if you decide to go back it 's good to be careful . 
  i 'm no conspiracy theorist but a lot of russian journalists ( putin critics ) and politicians ( putin opponents ) end up missing or dead . 
  btw do you think putin will run for president next year ? 
  he 's already been president for 8 and 5 years , or more if you think medvedev was under putin 's thumb . 
  seems like a lot if he serves another 6 . 
  sadly most russians are not as informed as you are , and remain supportive of putin . 
  but i see your flair so you 're probably exposed to more diverse news sources than the average russian . 
  i just would n't call a branch of islam that account for ~ 0.5 % of the world 's muslim population `` mainstream '' . 
  going with the meaning of the word ` current thought that is widespread ' , or ` the ideas , attitudes , or activities that are shared by most people and regarded as normal or conventional . ', 
  most muslims are n't wahhabists , it 's not mainstream by definition . 
  [ let me tell you . 
  did n't the nazis destroy most of the city ? 
  probably russians as well . 
  he probably means chinese immigrants . 
  little to no crime , no risk of terrorism , often well educated , employed , high income , 2nd/3rd etc generation is well integrated , etc. 
  basically good immigrants to have . 
  i do n't think poles would have a problem with chinese immigrants . 
  it made me laugh when i read it and scrolled down , it just kept going lol . 
  insane that 40 % still approve , what kind of standards do these people have ... 
   they 're not going to do anything , they 're just going to lie about the numbers like they always do . 
  you ca n't really deny the amount they 've been investing in renewables for years now . 
  [ in 2015 ] ( http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf ) they were responsible for a third of the world 's investments in renewables , more than the us and europe combined . 
  i feel like there are people on reddit who will criticize china no matter what they do . 
  this is something important they 're clearly doing good in , and it affects everyone on earth . 
  [ this comment said it well too . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/6efgnz/indian_prime_minister_narendra_modi_told_german/di9yq34/ ), 
  or eastern europeans are honorary portuguese :p, 
  good to hear young russians are well-integrated . 
  at least you 're in the eu and nato , so russia is far less likely to pull a ukraine on you if things somehow go sour . 
  what is that map at the start ? 
  alternative history ? 
  did n't know you have that many russians , holy shit .
