  the spread of wahhabism ( the most conservative form of islam ) is a fairly recent thing . 
  it was only a small group in saudi arabia at first , and it 's possible they would never have risen to power had it not been for british and american money , weapons , and protection . 
  ever since they got in power they 've been exporting their version of islam , funding wahhabist schools and mosques in other muslim countries . 
  or even in western countries , as most of us know by know . 
  you 're not trolling ? 
  i do n't want to believe that . 
  i think he 's joking/trolling , / u/executivemonkey is a regular here and he 's a bit subtle sometimes that he gets downvoted for it . 
  it does n't help him that there are many hamburgers who could say that and mean it . 
  e berlusconi leave the gun take the cannoli, 
   also , the state grants housing benefit if you study and live on your own this has to be a big reason . 
  if young students in other countries received affordable housing and student benefits ( and if jobs were available ) , i think the average would be lower there . 
  probably not as low as sweden or denmark because of the cultural differences , but lower still . 
  well if i had to choose something i 'd like here , it 's mountains . 
  not having mountains does n't reduce quality of life or anything , but they 're just really pretty to look at . 
  went to austria once and was amazed by the mountains , wanted to take them home with me to set them up next to my home city [ like this .

  what the saudis do also eventually has an effect on europe , with their funding of salafism and all .

  looks pretty unique but i like your current flag more , the pineapple is simply irresistible . 
  with stars is better also .

  yes , i should 've said `` most of them ca n't vote though '' . 
  is it closed off like that to reduce noise pollution ? 
  looks pretty cool, 
  i agree they should 've fought , but the people calling the shots really screwed them by putting them in that situation ( either fight an overwhelming force or abandon civilians ) . 
  i 'm not sure what would 've happened if they fought back , maybe the serbs would 've retreated ? 
  i would imagine killing 370 un / nato soldiers would have some dire consequences . 
  c'mon it 's not like the un is completely useless , they do plenty of good , for example :  [ in 2013 , the wfp reached 80.9 million people in 75 countries and provided 3.1 million tonnes of food , including nutritionally improved products such as plumpy ` sup , plumpy ` doz , and supercereal plus . 
  7.8 million malnourished children received special nutritional support in 2013 , and 18.6 million children received school meals or take-home rations . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_food_programme ) we always hear about bosnia and rwanda on reddit when the un comes up , but the good they do is never mentioned . 
  [ more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_development_group ), 
  probably because the serbs were battle-hardened and better armed . 
  they had tanks , artillery , and 1500 men . 
  compare that to the 370 men with only armored vehicles ( do n't know how many , could be just one ) . 
  it 's not likely they could 've fought the serbs off given the circumstances . 
  mostly as a deterrent i think , which does n't always work . 
  it was just a terrible situation all-around . 
  to my knowledge dutchbat only had some armored vehicles , no tanks or artilly like the serbs did , and they were also outnumbered 4 to 1 . 
  i think dutchbat should 've fought the serbs back ( i realise that 's easy to say with my keyboard ) but not alone , they would 've had no chance in that fight . 
  there should 've been more soldiers and with better equipment , and of course air support . 
  i think another mistake was disarming the bosnians . 
  either disarm both or disarm neither , taking away the weapons of one side makes them vulnerable . 
  if they 're made vulnerable then they should be protected . 
  if they 're to be protected then there should be enough properly armed un soldiers . 
  i 'm just a guy on reddit though , i 'm sure the un has experts that know better , but it seems like they made a lot of bad decisions in the bosnian war . 
  nope , a small percentage of officers are foreign legionnaires who were promoted . 
  about 25 % are of the entire legion is french , so the majority ca n't vote . 
   i think you can be french and in the foreign legion ... 
  most legionnaires are n't french . 
   including for the foreign legion . 
  do n't think they can vote though right ? 
  unless they have citizenship, 
  agreed , it looks like a mix between green and blue , but more green than blue . 
  well at least the pointless tradition of snipping foreskins ends when/if you get kids . 
  what does she mean when she says `` on top of that , they start to remove the wallpaper '' ? 
  is illegal immigrants taking down wallpaper a common issue in france ? 
  sounds like the birth of an urban myth :p, 
   i do n't think there should be legislation against it in the home anyway . 
  it comes down to a matter of independence and the ability to bring your children up how you see fit , which i believe that state should only have limited power over . 
  you 've probably received a bunch of responses already so i 'll keep it short . 
  the `` i turned out fine '' argument does n't work because there are many kids who do suffer long-term negative effects . 
  i happened to make an argument against corporal punishment yesterday [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/livestreamfail/comments/64y5w4/russian_streamer_reads_troll_comments_and_beats/dg6tqb0/?context=3 ) if i can change your mind on this . 
   i do n't think there should be legislation against it in the home anyway . 
  it comes down to a matter of independence and the ability to bring your children up how you see fit , which i believe that state should only have limited power over . 
  i think there should . 
  think about it ; any couple can have kids , and many people are simply unfit to be parents , whether they 're alcoholics , drug addicts , or simply abusive towards their kids . 
  kids need some form of protection from that because they ca n't choose their parents , and you ca n't stop people from having children . 
  yes parents should have the right to raise their kids the way they want to , but there are limits , kids are n't property . 
  yes , hard to learn i 've heard . 
  i also do n't know how they can hear the tonal differences when they speak so fast , i 'm guessing they 're hearing words and then using context to understand sentences . 
  it does make sense yeah , just thought it 's strange that they learn the latin alphabet even before the most basic mandarin characters , it being china and all . 
  i googled a bit myself and ca n't find much about it , i did find some quora answers that say kids learn pinyin in school though . 
  completely forgot about pinyin , that 's the latin system for mandarin afaik . 
  though simply reading it would make little sense for mandarin speakers , with the tonal stuff . 
  people have probably been saying that since early civilization . 
   fun fact : in prc , children learn to read latin alphabet before the chinese characters . 
  any source on that ? 
   it 's terrible for the environment . 
  you can still eat meat and not have a terrible impact on the environment . 
  most people simply enjoy meat too much , telling them to go from eating meat every day to none at all just wo n't work . 
  i eat meat but i mostly eat chicken now , and sometimes fish or pork . 
  lamb and beef are the [ hardest on the environment .
