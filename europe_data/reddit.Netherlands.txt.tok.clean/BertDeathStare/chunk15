  just drive tanks through balkans , what could go wrong ;p, 
  hmm ok , i take it you some fear of water ? 
  drowning seems like the far better choice to me . 
  really ? 
  why ? 
  it can be such a slow and painful death : l, 
  from what i 've read drowning is n't super painful , there 's a lot of panic and gasping for air and then you asphyxiate . 
  when you burn you usually die the same way , by asphyxiation , but not before experiencing extreme pain all over your body . 
  ever burnt your finger on a stove ? 
  imagine that all over your body . 
  fuck that , i choose drown . 
  i did n't say the part to which you 're replying to now , i think you mean to reply to / u/tonygaze . 
  your username fits you well btw :p, 
   i 've posted a link with the pew poll information . 
  you misunderstand . 
  you asked how it 's progressive to feel suicide bombings are `` sometimes justified '' and he directly answered your question . 
  `` it is n't . 
  ( it 's not progressive to feel that way about suicide bombings ) `` i do n't think anyone says so ... '' ( i do n't think anyone says it 's progressive to feel that way about suicide bombings ), 
  these kind of map websites are usually not very accurate , it 's just a map colored in by some random person on the internet ( who may have an agenda ) and there 's rarely any sources . 
  i was skeptical about the us being over 10 % vegetarian and found that it 's 3.4 % . 
  for italy it 's also wrong , it 's 7.1 % . 
  that 's still pretty high though .

  are these tolls frequent ? 
  and do n't they cause congestion ? 
  not everyone pays this tax , it 's a seperate tax for motor vehicle owners . 
  the amount you pay depends on the weight / fuel type / co2 emissions . 
  electric car owners pay the least afaik . 
  it 's not , it 's just paid via taxes . 
  ( did n't downvote you btw ) . 
  seems like it 's the same channel doing this scam in a lot of countries , we [ have them too . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2nseydyvq8 ) in 2008 there was an investigation in this tv channel and it was concluded that they artificially prolonged the waiting and conversation times to milk as much money as possible out of their callers . 
  it sucks that these channels exist , all they do is cheat gullible people out of their money . 
  nothing but snake oil to me . 
   south american languages !, 
  yeah i understand , i think many ( most ? ), 
  people only watch mma through ufc . 
  ufc made mma big that 's for sure . 
  the fat man being beaten and the jew costume reminds me of borat : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a952gcabscq, 
  that 's a company though is n't it ? 
  the sport would be mma , but that 's influenced by a lot of sports from various countries . 
   edit the answers are the funniest sht xd no wonder people say the left is paranoid and dumb . 
  sounding real mature here . 
  http://htwins.net/scale2/ i just ca n't imagine us being alone ; we 're a minuscule speck in the universe . 
   dutch people with turkish decent often say they are not dutch but turks as well . 
  to be fair we call them turks as well , even though they 're dutch citizens . 
  it 's pretty much the same for any minority , even white ones such as poles . 
  we have our shit together pretty well as a country , but we 're not perfect , and this is one thing i 'd like to see change . 
  everyone should be nederlands ( dutch ) . 
  the canadian or australian model seems pretty good ; everyone is canadian/australian . 
  in the us everyone is american too , though they do seem to seperate themselves with ethnic groups ( african american , latino american , asian american , etc ) . 
  never considered that racist at all , east asia is just a region in asia . 
  east asians are people from east asia , no race involved , just geography . 
  is it racist to say north-africans ? 
  or eastern europeans ? 
  i agree that race is outdated and bullshit , but i think we can still use words to describe people from certain regions without any racist or bigoted intentions . 
  do you mean ferdinand ii instead of rudolf ii ? 
  i do n't want to be a dick here but indonesians are from south-east asia . 
  the biggest east asian group would probably be the chinese . 
  if the amount of evidence is not equal in two cases of the same crime , i do n't see the problem with different punishments . 
  in a case of oj ; prison . 
  in the case of video evidence ; death sentence ( for serial killers , not oj ) . 
  it 's just my opinion on this topic and i 'm not a crime/law expert , so do n't take it too seriously . 
  i would n't even know how high to set the bar for what crime deserves life in prison , and what deserves the death sentence . 
  definitely the death sentence for serial killers though . 
  how would you be 95 % certain ? 
  like with oj simpson ? 
  dna evidence , witnesses , motive , but no video evidence ? 
  i 'd say prison , but not execution . 
  the judges/jury would have to decide though . 
  only execution if there 's 100 % certainty . 
  there 's no easy answer to this . 
  well there have been cases of people getting wrongfully executed , so it should only happen if it 's 100 % certain they did it . 
  if they 're innocent , they obviously should n't be executed nor even be in prison . 
  innocent until proven guilty . 
  what if everything was on video ? 
  like a murderer filming himself planning everything , and also the murder itself being on video . 
  i 'm only for it with cases of undeniable evidence , and only with horrible crimes . 
  i would have zero problems with serial killers being executed for example . 
  the world would be better off without them , they 're not even worth the oxygen imo . 
  kind of looks like he has a long beard , wise wizard dog ;p, 
  cool , i thought it was only done in rural areas . 
  maybe i 'll hunt some day too , probably start with a bow and arrow against a grizzly bear or something ( jk ) . 
  did you show op your dog ? 
  show me your dog pls ;p, 
  do n't think it 's a `` mainstream '' hobby , but certainly some people do it . 
  not so much in the netherlands ( too small , not much game ) as in germany/france/spain / scandinavia etc. 
  you could be right but are there that many hunters in the us ? 
  they 're also a great family dog , very safe with children and protective . 
  their intelligence and gentleness is why they 're trained as guide/disability dogs i think . 
  do you have a dog ? 
  i want one but ca n't get one currently :( some day though . 
  here it 's 1 . labs 2 . 
  german shepherd 3 . golden retriever . 
  would n't surprise me if they 're popular in many countries , they 're very sweet and gentle dogs , especially labs and retrievers . 
  those 3 are my favorite breeds as well , but huskies are awesome too . 
  apparently huskies are n't even in the top 10 here , i guess it 's because they 're known to be one of the harder breeds to train , and also needs a lot of exercise . 
  `` go fuck yourself '' . 
  also like `` beauty is in the eye of the beholder '' .
