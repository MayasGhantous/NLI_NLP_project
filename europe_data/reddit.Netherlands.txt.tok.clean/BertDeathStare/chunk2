   most dutch people are fluent in english and often times french and german !, 
  most dutch are often times fluent in french ** and ** german ? 
  you do n't think you 're overestimating the average dutch person 's language capabilities ? 
  i can believe most people being fluent in english , albeit with an accent , but not both french and german . 
  perhaps one of the two languages , and even then i 'd be skeptical when they say they 're `` fluent '' . 
  knowing how to introduce yourself or how to count is not fluent . 
   by ` normally ' you mean not the us ? 
  i think asian meaning indian/pakistani/bangladeshi is mostly a uk thing . 
  thanks , now i 'm going there some day for sure . 
  those tombs look stunning , are you allowed inside to see them ? 
  mmmm pic 4 and 6, 
  you do n't have to be fat to be unattractive . . 
  the face is more important for attraction ( to me anyway ) . 
  i think he 's right , a photographer is more likely to take pictures of attractive people . 
  for russia , more than [ 60 percent ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/who-russians-smoke-the-most/422117.html ) of russian men and almost 22 percent of women smoke . 
  so that makes 41 % total , not nearly 85 , but still a lot . 
  it also says a little below that the average life expectancy of russian men is 62 years old ( 74 for women ) , i had no idea it was that low for men . . why do you think it is ? 
  i 'd guess it 's a result of a heavy drinking culture plus lots of smokers . 
  they should be careful , soon russian troops will accidentally get lost in moldova while on vacation in ukraine . 
  i see , but you have to ride on the road , next to cars ? 
  i have to do that sometimes too , it feels less safe than a lane seperated by pavement , but still pretty safe because drivers are quite used to cyclists . 
  they also know that if there 's an accident between a car and a cyclist , the car driver will almost certainly get the blame , so they 're extra careful :p, 
  could make your cities more bicycle friendly . 
  it would be a huge project though , especially since american cities are pretty large as well afaik , and you have so many of them :p that said , maybe step by step it will happen . 
  i think san francisco is already on the path to becoming more cycling-friendly , maybe la after that . 
  well i like to think people are n't all that nationalistic and would answer honestly and not rate their own countries 10/10 if it does n't deserve it , but i 'm saying the results would be skewed if some people did it several times . 
  you should only be able to vote once per ip address . 
  it 's possible to change your ip but it would be less likely for people to `` cheat '' . 
  are there any countries that recognize the british antarctic territorial claims ? 
  i clicked it again to see if i could see the results , but it just gave me a fresh survey . 
  call me a pessimist but i think this makes your survey vulnerable to \u00fcber-nationalistic people who want to make their country look better , and perhaps make countries they dislike look worse . 
  ah , of course :p well in that case you do have a point , i would rather not have people carrying guns , nor would i want a gun for myself . 
  i do n't feel like i 'm missing on any personal freedom though . 
  perhaps i 'd be pro-gun if i lived in a dangerous area , but there are n't really any dangerous areas here afaik , so the freedom to own a gun is n't on my list of priorities . 
  i also think if it ever came to a vote here , keeping guns illegal would probably get the vast majority of the votes . 
  not sure what personal freedom we do n't have in europe that the us does have though . . 
  i guess it depends on which european country he 's from . 
  no it seems [ it 's 20,7 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_netherlands ) , but i 'm not sure what they mean with multicultural background . 
  does it include those who came from other european countries , such as germans or poles ? 
  guessing they do n't , then it 's just 15 % . 
  [ netherlands 68.98  64.39 finland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ugg32vb.gif ) [ pack it up boys , we 're done here . 
  he 's a maniac . 
  if that blows your mind , look at bangladesh ; 156m people in 147k km2 . 
  for comparison japan has 128m in 378k km2 , and france 64m and 551k km2 . 
  in dutch the baltic countries are letland , litouwen , and estland , you can probably guess which is which :p, 
  he should 've said `` have as many more '' then , half as many really means half :p, 
  then again numbers do n't mean everything , can they even transport them ? 
  there 's also wmd 's , russia has a lot more of them . 
  it 's just a bit strange that i get downvoted so fast on / r/europe at this time for asking a question . 
  alright . 
  not sure if military spending alone concludes that , but as i said , it 's believable . 
  the sheer amount of people they have , their enormous and robust economy and military spending is enough warning for any country not to want conflict with china . 
  a bit weird that you downvoted my question though . . 
  not that it 's not believable , but how do you know that ? 
  [ words ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5ulrkdoq_m ) [ sentences ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxvewjkdy88 ), 
  i like the sound of russian and turkish , if that 's an option . 
  turkey is a leading example for other muslim majority countries , i just hope erdogan is n't going to ruin everything atat\u00fcrk accomplished . 
  belgium and germany , but if i could pick flanders alone then that would probably come first . 
  damn . . 
  the way she killed them is horrifying . 
  she reminds me of [ amelia dyer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amelia_dyer ) , a serial killer from the uk . 
  it 's thought that she has killed hundreds in her lifetime as a `` baby farmer . '', 
  she would take in unwanted babies under the promise that they 'd be well taken care of , but she 'd just let them starve to death . 
  any time the locals got suspicious because of all the babies disappearing under her care , she 'd just use a different alias and move to another city . 
  she was eventually caught and hanged . 
  i chose the uk because i can read/write/understand / speak english , albeit with an accent . 
  if the question was ` which european country other than your own would you want to be born in the most ? ', 
  then i 'd probably pick norway , because it 's super safe , wealthy , has beautiful nature , etc. 
  a lot of other countries are close behind though , like denmark , sweden , germany , the uk , france , austria , and switzerland . 
  seriously wondering why this could be controversial lol . 
  dutch food is not famous like french , italian , or chinese cuisine , but we have some tasty sweet stuff like poffertjes and oliebollen that everyone seems to love , tourists too . 
  our fast food is also pretty good ; bitterballen ( only bitter in name ) , berenhap , kroket , frikandel , kaasouffl\u00e9 , kibbeling , etc. 
  other than that i do n't like any typical dutch foods myself . 
  thankfully people from all over the world brought their cuisines here so we can enjoy that as well . 
  [ here are some pictures ] ( http://blog.thuisbezorgd.nl/typisch-nederlands-eten-gerechten-en-eetwedstrijden/ ) of typical dutch food , especially the 2nd to the 6th pictures . 
  really simple stuff , mostly mixes of vegetable/potato/sausage . 
  this kind of food is probably pretty common in similar cultures , such as germany and scandinavian countries . 
  one of those pictures is called zuurkool , which you probably know as sauerkraut , same thing :p, 
  is nationalism common in poland ? 
  often when i see pictures of demonstrations or gatherings in poland there are a ton of national flags . 
  is this sarcasm ? 
  [ stereotype ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stereotype ) is most frequently now employed to refer to ** an often unfair and untrue belief ** that many people have about all people or things with a particular characteristic . 
  [ a set idea ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stereotype ) that people have about what someone or something is like , ** especially an idea that is wrong ** : [ een stereotype ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/stereotype ) is een overdreven beeld van een groep mensen dat vaak niet ( volledig ) overeenkomt met de werkelijkheid . 
  the weed meme is a prime example of a stereotypical exaggeration ( dutch people smoke a lot of weed ) , not sure how you 're arguing against this . 
  just heavily exaggerated , pretty much removing the `` truth '' bit tbh ; like with the weed meme . 
  yep , stereotypes in a nutshell . 
  http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=420%20blaze%20it weed meme, 
   internationalist mutts well i can already tell where this is going . . 
  thanks . 
   there are government work groups teaching the chinese government how to effectively run a country . 
  where can i read about this ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ixx25s2ip4 that 's voice over , i took it from another user 's comment . 
  sounds really bad imo , you hear two people talking over each other even though only one person is talking . . voice over is a crime against humanity . 
   most of the posters on / r/unitedkingdom ar n't brits . 
  they are europeans who live in britain how do you know that ? 
  great has multiple meanings , in this context great just means large/powerful , not necessarily good . 
  like this : [ a great fire destroyed nearly half the city . 
  ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/great ), 
  well nobody mentioned the us , so nobody said the us is completely innocent either . 
  anytime there 's a thread that puts russia in a bad light there will be whataboutism all over the comments ; `` what about iraq/guantanamo/america .
