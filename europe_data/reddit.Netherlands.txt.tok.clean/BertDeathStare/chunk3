  '' , to deflect criticism of russia . 
  it 's interesting that when there 's a post that criticizes the us ( which there are plenty of on reddit ) you never see `` what about russia !, 
  '' , even when there are thousands of comments . 
  but in this thread , with just over a hundred comments , just look at the amount of deflection . 
  also i ca n't take bingdao 's comment very seriously , guantanamo bay is n't exactly unknown to the average redditor ; this political prisoner though , i 've never even heard of him . 
   so do you think that in the past or in rural areas he would beat children too in the netherelands ? 
  yeah possibly in the past , i think the pieten carried [ this ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=birch&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewidjbfn8vhpahuibmakhzv5b10q_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=birch+whip ) with them , some branches tied together at one end . 
  nowadays it 's mostly telling kids if they misbehave they 'll go in the sack the pieten carry with them , and they 'll be taken to spain with sinterklaas . 
  ( not that spain is some kind of hellhole , but more as in being seperated from mom and dad ) . 
  or they just say if you misbehaved this year , sinterklaas will know by reading from his book , and you 'll get no presents/sweets . 
  i say good riddance to the birch whip ; it 's supposed to be a fun event for them , not a fearful one . 
  the ottomans were pretty tolerant for their time . 
  during the spanish inquisition , jews were told to convert or leave , and those who left were welcomed by the ottomans to settle in their lands . 
  the sultan even sent the navy to safely bring them over . 
  risking his job for a twix , smart guy . 
  beggars ca n't be choosers , the nuns are waiting :p, 
  good to know . 
  i 'm guessing there 's also an age gap so the approval rate will only continue to increase . 
  not true , it was reported the next morning , or technically the same day since it happened on new year 's eve . 
   in an interview with the bbc , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said there was `` nothing to accept or deny '' , as he understood these were preliminary findings . 
   `` we can not accept as final truth of what they say . 
  i bet you have n't seen any proof of what they say , '' he told the hardtalk programme , adding : `` we know the devil is in the detail , and we are still missing lot of the detail . '', 
  where is proofs !? 
  this is homogay dutch provocation !, 
   which just goes to show we are the best at sport in europe . 
  it probably has a lot to do with a good sports infrastructure and funding differences . 
  it 's a bit hard to find info on this for various countries , but for example for the 2012 olympics germany spent [ # 104.4 m ] ( https://www.dosb.de/en/organisation/wir-ueber-uns/dosb-profile/ ) while the uk spent [ # 264m ] ( http://www.uksport.gov.uk/our-work/investing-in-sport/historical-funding-figures ) . 
  olympic spending for the uk went up to [ # 350m ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/sports/olympics/britains-huge-investment-in-summer-olympic-sports-pays-off.html?_r=0 ) in 2016 . 
  apart from funding , keep in mind that there 's also a size difference in national teams ; not many european countries brought as many athletes as the uk did . 
  you would n't be allowed in some places without taking it off though , like a bank or gas station . 
  build a wall around lithuania to protect the milk , and make belgium pay for it !, 
  cool stuff , we also have it on the first monday of the month at 12:00 , also [ audio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agikhls_dls ) . 
  20 + heat plus high humidity sucks , my body is just sticky the whole day , and trying to sleep is even worse . 
  ca n't imagine living in brazil or something , where it 's just hot and humid all the time . 
  the average dutch woman is probably about 1cm shorter than the latvian so i doubt it would matter much . 
  yeah that too . 
  it seems like the prisons want to use the families of inmates to help pay for the costs . 
  it 's all really shady tbh . 
  just an fyi : not only private prisons profit off inmates . 
  private companies or the prisons themselves charge fees for families to send money to inmates . 
  the companies share part of that profit with prison operators . 
  in many prisons inmates also work below minimum wage . 
  inmates then use that money they worked for or received to buy items like toilet paper or snacks from the prison . 
  sources [ one ] ( https://consumerist.com/2014/09/30/transferring-funds-to-prisoners-is-big-business-for-some-financial-companies/ ) / [ two ] ( http://nation.time.com/2013/08/21/welcome-to-prison-will-you-be-paying-cash-or-credit/ ), 
   however , that makes them economic migrant . 
  slice it anyway you want what they are doing is illegal . 
  they are leaving safe countries for economic benefits by crossing borders illegally . 
  it 's understandable , but it makes them economic migrants and not refugees . 
  yes , i was n't arguing they were , i was just giving you an explanation why it might seem like they 're leaving their families behind , even though they are n't . 
   also there 's the problem of misinformation . 
  for instance in my county it 's almost impossible to get the motion to have family members to join you before a 3 year mark or so . 
  they need to go through asylum process that takes month . 
  get employed and show with past income ( i think it 's either a year or six months ) that they can provide for their family by reaching a certain minimum per family member from the income , that that employment is stable and secure and a properly sized home . 
  they need to accomplish this within a certain frame of time after their asylum is approved and then they can start the process for their wife and/or children that are dependent minors . 
  this make a journey and then family can take a ride is a harmful fairytale . 
  well that 's slovenia then , it can be completely different from sweden and germany , where most of them go . 
  even if the families wait in turkey/jordan/lebanon for years , they can still receive money from the men in europe , whether they receive it in the form of welfare or a paid job . 
  i do n't think they just abandon their families , they 're still human . 
  they leave their families behind in safe countries like turkey , lebanon , jordan , which all take in far more refugees than europe . 
  the men then make the journey alone to apply for asylum , and if they receive it their families can join them . 
  perhaps they do it so the men can send money back , and the rest of the family can have a safer and more comfortable journey than the man did . 
   [ last june , men accounted for 73 per cent of those who risked the dangerous sea crossing to europe from turkey , via greece . 
  but according to new figures from the un high commissioner for refugees , they have accounted for just 45 per cent so far this year . 
  at the same time , the proportion of women has nearly doubled from a low of 11 per cent last summer to 21 per cent now . 
  children account for the remaining 34 per cent . 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dff3b5ea-bf99-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2.html ) why they want to go to europe instead of turkey/lebanon/jordan is fairly obvious ; these countries are more developed/wealthy and have better welfare systems . 
  since they 're given the choice , it 's not surprising they choose western/northern europe over the other options . 
  that 's ... dedication . 
  thanks , i guess if it was a goal from his mistake that would 've been bad for his carreer then :p, 
  damn really ? 
  it would 've made so many people ( rightfully ) mad if they scored then . 
  too bad france , well played though . 
  congrats to portugal , a new uefa champion !, 
  does anyone know what would 've happened if the free kick at 106 mins was a goal ? 
  would it have counted since the referee made a mistake ? 
   i cant get gay marriage and adopt kid with other man to , so i have same rights as them . 
  what are these mental gymnastics ? 
  if you 're gay you ca n't marry/adopt , if you 're straight you can ; clearly gay people do n't have the same rights as straight people do , which is discrimination . 
   and no one is discriminated here , they have same rights and laws to obey as i do or any other pole . 
  if they have the same rights , why is n't gay marriage legal and why ca n't lgbt couples adopt ? 
  just two things that came to mind , i 'm sure there are more ways they 're discriminated against . 
  it 's funny how much most poles dislike russia , but in many ways you 're so similar . 
   and they get ridiculed and arrested whereas the muslims in the picture i presented are allowed to have these signs out with no interference . 
  both neo-nazis and extremist muslims are allowed to protest , and both are ridiculed . 
  there 's police presence when either of them demonstrate , but the neo-nazis tend to be in much smaller numbers so they need more protection than the muslims do . 
  people have/had grandparents who fought the nazis or suffered from them , so neo-nazis might hit closer to home and evoke a stronger reaction . 
  muslims demonstrating for sharia law are morons as well , but everyone knows it wo n't happen . 
  alright , that 's good . 
  i think it 's the same with geert wilders ( i think he 's the only one who would want to leave the eu ) , he has some support in the polls but he loses a lot of it when it comes to the actual elections . 
  none of the other large parties want to work with him either so he would need an absolute majority to win and that 's very unlikely . 
  do you think le pen can win the 2017 election ? 
  or is it unlikely ? 
  https://twitter.com/skydata/status/746700869656256512?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw it 's normal that older generations vote more , but it saddens me that the younger generations did n't come outto vote en masse just this once . 
  this is something that will affect them much more than the 65 + . 
  it 's a shame so few of them voted though : l, 
  as if china would just sit idly while the uk does all that . . 
  you guys can be house [ hot pie ] ( http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/hot_pie ) :p, 
  it might sound odd , and i had a hard time believing it too , but it 's serious and quite possible . 
  i will try to explain . 
  you see in the netherlands the vast majority of people use bicycles for transportation , not for exercise or racing , so people do n't go very fast .
