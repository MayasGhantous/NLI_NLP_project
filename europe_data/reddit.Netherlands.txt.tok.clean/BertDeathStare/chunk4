  this kind of [ bike ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=omafiets+imgur&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewinvupd7ejmahvnasakhfmgc4wq_auibygb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979#tbm=isch&amp;q=omafiets ) is the most common , even for kids . 
  slow but pretty comfortable . 
  if you do n't go very fast and you fall , it 's unlikely to get badly injured . 
  also when falling while bicycle it 's very rare to fall on your head , it 's more common to fall to the side , so on your arms and legs , and a helmet is n't going to protect those parts . 
  there was a [ canadian study ] ( http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/11/e008052.full.pdf+html ) on this , they noticed that there were n't more cyclists being hospitalized in areas of the country where it 's illegal to ride without a helmet than in areas where it 's not illegal . 
  not even if they only looked at head injuries . 
  the study concluded that helmets have little to no effect on the rate of cyclist injuries , but other factors do , such as cycling infrastructure ( the netherlands has great cycling infrastructure ) and the number of cyclists . 
  cycling lanes seperated from the road by trees , parking spots , curbs , etc , reduces accident rates . 
  the researchers also think that when drivers constantly see cyclists they will watch out for them more . 
  people here do n't want to wear helmets , it 's inconvenient because no one wants to drag a helmet along every time they go to school , work , the supermarket , anything . 
  even if a law was passed here that enforces a cycling helmet , the law would simply be ignored or people would stop cycling . 
  less cyclists , less safety in numbers . 
  it 's also thought that cyclists ride more agressively when wearing a helmet because they feel more protected , and drivers [ pass closer ] ( http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/2006/9/11/overtaking110906.html ) when overtaking cyclists wearing helmets , than those who do n't . 
  this leads to more accidents . 
  all this is called the [ ` bicycle helmet paradox . 
  ' ] ( http://crag.asn.au/the-paradox-of-bicycle-helmets/ )  this is the paradox of bicycle helmets . 
  people believe their helmets saved them , despite suffering more injuries . 
  the catch is that the helmet saved them from accidents that may not have happened without the helmet . 
  also the laws here are very protective of pedestrians and cyclists , if there 's an accident it 's up to the driver to prove his innocence . 
  if a driver hits a cyclist ( not sure about pedestrians ) aged 14 and under they will always be at fault , even if the kid was cycling recklessly . 
  the law simply says kids are unpredictable , and you should drive accordingly around them . 
  sorry for the wall of text , it requires a bit of typing to explain something that sounds illogical :p, 
  yeah liveleak is pretty bad . 
  whenever any video is about muslims or black people it 's `` niggers '' or `` dindus '' that , and `` mudslimes '' this and `` rapefugees '' that . 
  `` chinks '' gets thrown around a lot too . 
  it 's like stormfront but with videos sometimes . 
  you 'll notice when it 's a video of a white person doing something bad , not a single word is said about him being white , suddenly he becomes an individual . 
  amazing how hypocritical racists can be without them realizing it . 
  worldstarhiphop can also be pretty bad , only the other way around , often the top comments are racist shit against white people . 
  this black guy [ talks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=856yykq14r8 ) about how the comments are always full of shit towards white people . 
  i just stopped reading the comments if i happen to watch a video on either website , it 's just the same echo-chamber garbage every time . 
  the uk has nice rap , i was scrolling a bit and i like this one a lot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rivfcwwvoh8, 
   trianon pact i see , thanks . 
  can i ask why hungary is so disliked ? 
  is it because of wwi and wwii ? 
  do people still hold a grudge for that ? 
  or something else ? 
  in addition to that ; [ 91 % ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wdokimq.png?1 ) of the population supported equal marriage in 2015 , which is a 9 % rise from a [ 2006 survey . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb66/eb66_highlights_en.pdf ) 100 % in 2024 ? 
  :p adoption rights for gay couples was 69 % in 2006 , followed by sweden at 51 % . 
  suck it finland !, 
  because stalin was a lunatic who wanted all power for himself . 
  he did n't want the church to have any power , so he took steps to reduce their influence . 
  worship the state , not god . 
  not sure if you can say it was all done in the name of atheism . 
  i think the lights in your picture are more exaggerated and less realistic than ops version . 
  the owners of the 2nd tallest building should do that too , so they can have a flag-standoff :p, 
  i do n't think many would disagree about the pkk , but what about the other three ? 
  are those considered terrorist organizations too according to erdogan or the turkish people ? 
  the only dutch metal bands i know of are within temptation and heidevolk . 
  most metal fans probably know of within temptation , as for heidevolk this is probably their best-known [ song . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reolelx0q9u ), 
  looks great . 
  were parts of it repaired or rebuilt in recent times , or has it just been well-preserved ? 
  yeah , the dutch royal family house is [ orange-nassau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_orange-nassau ) , orange is of [ french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_of_orange ) origin and nassau [ german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_nassau ) :p, 
  france 's motto is the nicest imo . 
  * further beyond * and * truth prevails * are nice too . 
  few people actually read the article on reddit , if you did n't know that . 
  all it takes for some people to downvote posts is if it puts neo-nazis in a bad light in the title of the post , it seems . 
  if the title had muslims instead of neo-nazis , it would n't have that many downvotes , was my point , and i stand by it . 
  kind of sad that this post has 67 % upvotes . 
  if ` neo-nazi ' was replaced with ` muslim ' it would be in the 90s . 
  makes you wonder what kind of people browse / r/europe . 
  same applies to a lot of european countries though . 
  that 's good but i think it 's only higher because poles here tend to be young men , and the dutch bar includes all ages . 
  that would only make sense if the question was `` will you be better off economically after brexit '' . 
  it 's a pretty straightforward question . 
  it 's amazing that 28.9 % of brits still think brexit will be a good thing for the uk economy . 
  i wonder what their reasoning is . 
  last time this was posted ( ~ one month ago ) and i commented , it went [ a bit like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsdv5lo0uwu ) . 
  i was able to understand everything he said , i 'd say that 's the most important part . 
  it 's good enough to communicate with someone who 's trying to learn english anyway . 
  i have way more trouble understanding many dialects from the uk tbh , and for them it 's their native tongue . 
  sounds good to me , just has a bit of an accent . 
  maybe he practiced with someone from colombia . 
  some people do that , they find people who speak the language they 're trying to learn and they just talk to them for practice . 
  in turn , the colombian person can practice their english with him . 
  ordinary turks who make a living off tourism will suffer the most from this . 
  first generation east asians often have trouble assimilating and form their own communities , but their kids and grandkids etc born here are assimilated very well . 
  remove finland from premises !, 
  if you throw boris , nigel , and may out of an airplane above the sahara desert , we can start talking . 
  also look at other candidates music videos to make it fair, 
  bigly true , believe me , believe me . 
  * eu slaps uk with # 50bn bill * it is all over !, 
  just . 
  like . 
  that !, 
  i 'd be surprised if most people even know we 're a tax haven tbh . 
  bunga bungad his way in between them :p though in some time - maybe 50 years , everyone will have forgotten about berlusconi but most people will still know who those other names are . 
  pretty good , the woman spoke it better imo , the guy sounded more german . 
  i think it 's data missing for turkey , it should probably look something like france or poland . 
  agree , turkey seems rather empty for 75m people too . 
   same way we trade with japan . 
  there 's a fact for you . 
  that happened quite a long time ago , plus japan had no wmds themselves , plus their economy did n't completely rely on trade with the us . 
  apples and oranges , really bad comparison . 
   actually , though , i reject the premise : russia would n't need to use them or threaten to use them . 
  you know they have them . 
  that 's enough to dissuade action . 
  then again some eu members have wmds as well .
