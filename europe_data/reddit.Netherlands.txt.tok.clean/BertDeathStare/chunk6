  there are more variations of this kind of dish but i do n't find most of them tasty , they taste like vegetables to me more than anything . 
  the upside is that it 's filling and probably quite healthy , i guess that 's good for all the kids eating it while growing up . 
  complimenting the netherlands while making fun of belgium ? 
  [ excellent . 
  and the british will pay for it !, 
  also australia and new zealand have about the same standard of living as western/northern europe . 
  well i did n't say `` russia is a really shitty neighbor compared to 1940s nazi germany . '', 
  in the present ; germany is a much better neighbor than russia . 
  actually not even just the present , germany has been a good neighbor for decades now . 
  true , but maybe ukraine would 've taken a completely different path if they somehow joined in 2004 . 
  it also helps to have a friendly neighbor that also happens to be the largest economy in europe , rather than a corrupt authoritarian country that actively tries to corrupt yours . 
  ukraine is n't in the eu though , and russia is a really shitty neighbor compared to germany . 
  that 's pretty dark . 
  they did not fuck around with punishment back then . 
  i can understand why mods are hesitant to remove popular posts ; they 'll get accused of censorship or being power hungry very fast . 
   are you now putting words in my mouth ? 
  how low of you . . 
  which is funny because that 's what you 've been doing a lot in this small back and forth . 
  you even went full [ godwin 's law . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin's_law ) i also did n't put any words in your mouth , you literally said all those things . 
  or did you already forget ? 
  you can always scroll up if you did . 
   well that sounds like something you really believe . 
  nah , i look at facts . 
  europe is [ one of the safest ] ( http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_global_homicide_book_web.pdf ) regions in the world , kind of conflicts with you calling it a `` hellhole '' , does n't it ? 
  you call it that because you believe it 's true , not because of actual data . 
  feels over reals . 
   but do n't be suprised when brexit happens i wo n't , they voted on it . 
   or eu ends . 
  the eu is still going strong , so i 'll believe it when i see it . 
   and you will be saying `` how could this happen , i am so smart , everybody is ignorant '' and it will come full circle . 
  i 'm seeing lots of speculation . 
  i 'm done , this is pointless . 
  you 've dug yourself a hole of alternative facts and there 's no way you 're coming out , no matter how much i try to reason with you or how many facts i show you . 
  enjoy the last word , i know children love that , 
  wow , you sure showed me . 
  europe is such a hellhole full of rape and violence , it 's incredible i even managed to survive so far . 
  if you believe hard enough , it becomes reality ; alternative facts . 
  it 's true , let me tell you , people tell me i have the best alternative facts , smart people . 
   so there is no increase in rape in sweden , good for them . 
  all these official statistics are flawed . 
  not what i said . 
  it 's not as high as in your graph though . 
  or if it is , it 's because they measure it differently than other countries , and reporting is way higher . 
  you do n't actually think india 's rape rate is that low , do you ? 
   there is terrorism you say . 
  who causes it ? 
  terrorists . 
   and how to stop it ? 
  ask some experts . 
  a good first step would be to stop funding and selling weapons to saudi arabia , the country which has been exporting wahhabism for decades and continues to do so . 
   who is more prone to crime ? 
  poor people . 
   who causes majority of terrorists atacks ? 
  islamists . 
  is there a point to all these silly questions ? 
   who does n't share your opinion is ignorant ? 
  never said that . 
  i think many of those who voted leave know very little about the eu though , and think leaving will fix their problems . 
  it wont , however . 
   american democracy is flawed ? 
  definitely . 
  any democracy where you basically have two candidates to choose from is a flawed democracy to me . 
  first past the post is shit too . 
  also the fact that individuals and corporations can donate/influence candidates with their money . 
  you are the brainwashed one :d very mature . 
  how old are you ? 
   trump is literally hitler right ? 
  keep putting words on my mouth , makes your position look so much stronger . 
  forget it , i do n't even know why i bothered , i should n't have expect a reasonable and mature person behind such irrational and ignorant comments . 
  keep believing in your alternative facts , it does n't matter . 
   i prefer to stick to what i see . 
  sounds a lot like feels over reals . 
  the problem with that is that you can see anything you want , and i can see the complete opposite . 
  a third person can see something completely different from what the both of us see . 
  it goes on and on . 
  what then ? 
  i prefer to stick to the facts . 
  brexit was a mistake based on lies by the media and ignorance of the public , and trump winning says more of the us 's flawed democracy than anything . 
  people had the choice of hillary and trump , and people chose trump because they saw her as a corrupt leader , and they wanted to `` drain the swamp '' . 
  now that trump is president , he seems to be filling the swamp more than draining it . 
   2 years of state of emergency in france . 
  army with automatic guns everywhere . 
  why ? 
  when terrorism , rape and murder are just alternative facts ?!, 
  because of terrorism , and because armed soldiers make people feel safer . 
  that 's not the alternative facts i 'm talking about though . 
  for one it 's you proposing sweden has a very high rape rate , and that 's easily refutable . 
  another is your exaggerations , such as `` europe turning into a hellhole '' , while europe is still one of the most developed and safest regions in the world . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19592372' https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4yie7f/do_you_know_that_sweden_has_the_highest_rape_rate/d6o5wib/ you probably already knew all this though , but as a the_donald regular you prefer to stick to your alternative breitbart/infowars facts . 
  sad !, 
  holy shit that 's insane . 
  no wonder their news is state controlled , so much propaganda bullshit . 
  really proud of the romanian people . 
  love it when people come together to stand up for what is right . 
  it 's not really a fair representation of the population 's wealth though , because of the tax haven stuff . 
  median income is more accurate for the general population , without being skewed by tax havens or countries with high inequality . 
  you can see norway and ireland being close to the top in the first link , but ireland drops down a lot with the second . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income, 
  he 's only been president for a very short time , so there 's no telling how well he will do , but based on the things he has said i do think sanders would be a better president .
