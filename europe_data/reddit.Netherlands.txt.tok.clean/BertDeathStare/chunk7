  it 's not just the things he says , it 's also how he says them , the way he speaks is almost condescending . 
  trump does n't `` believe '' in climate change , and is working against renewable energy by electing [ another climate change denier ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/07/trump-scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency ) as head of the environmental protection agency . 
  trump has also said vaccines cause autism . 
  let that sink in , the president of one of the most developed countries in the world is anti-science . 
  mike pence ( his chosen vp ) is [ most likely ] ( http://www.snopes.com/2016/11/13/mike-pence-evolution/ ) a creationist . 
  same goes for his pick for [ secretary of eduation . 
  ] ( https://www.propublica.org/article/devos-education-nominees-code-words-for-creationism-offshoot-raise-concerns ) trump also wants to [ defund planned parenthood ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1357/defund-planned-parenthood/ ) , i happen to think abortion should be a human right . 
  i hope for the us ( and the world ) that he does well , but my expectations are not high . 
  i ca n't think of any reason why sanders would pick such clowns to be by his side , nor can i remember anything sanders has said that made me question his intelligence . 
  if anything , sanders has proven himself to stand by his values , he 's been [ fighting for civil rights ] ( http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/20-examples-bernie-sanders-powerful-record-civil-and-human-rights-1950s ) for half of his life . 
  trump would rather take those rights away by defunding planned abortion . 
  he 'd rather spend money on a pointless wall . 
  yes he was . 
  if they had n't , maybe sanders would 've won . 
  i think he would 've been a much better president not only for the american people , but also as a representative of the country to the rest of the world . 
  makes me sad to think about what you could 've had ( sanders ) , and you end up with trump . 
   i have always believed europeans are not willing to fight for their own countries ( a survey was recently posted on this sub backing that up ) so i do n't really expect europeans to be willing to cross the ocean and die for a country like canada . 
  i do n't know the actual percentage of europeans who would defend canada , but i 'm guessing you 're talking about [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5qfmt4/percentage_of_europeans_who_are_willing_to_fight/ ) ? 
  i would n't take that too seriously , they do n't even specify what kind of war it would be . 
  that 's why the percentage is so high in finland or ukraine , where the people ( justifiably ) assume it would be a defensive war against an invading russian force . 
  the french/dutch/germans / british/italians etc are n't directly threatened by any country , so they probably understand the question as `` would you go to the middle east and and fight isis ? '', 
  or `` would you go to iraq to help occupy it ? '', 
  it 's reasonable to think the percentage for finland and ukraine would be totally different if they were asked to go fight in iraq or syria , and likewise for the rest of europe if they were asked to defend against an aggressor . 
  sure !, 
  ^ ^ ^ step ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ complete , ^ ^ ^ now ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ give ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ belgian ^ ^ ^ troops ^ ^ ^ toy ^ ^ ^ guns ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ send ^ ^ ^ them ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ front ^ ^ ^ lines , ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ belgium ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ ours ^ ^ ^ again !, 
  do n't you do it germany !, 
  good for you , you 're improving . 
  glad i could help . 
  did plenty of thought , as you can see my comments are longer than 3 words . 
  besides , there was more to it than just that , but i see you put as much effort into reading as you put into your responses . 
  i should n't have bothered responding to you , it 's not even worth it . 
  put some effort into your responses or do n't bother . 
  you 're overreacting . 
  the difference is that it 's your anus where the poop goes through , not your hands . 
  you do n't use your anus to shake hands or grab things . 
  it 's pretty much `` closed '' and covered by the buttocks the entire day , and at the end of the day ( or the start ) you shower and clean it properly . 
  toilet paper works fine , get over it . 
   we are way more clean than the rest of the world and we are literally shocked when we realize that people around the world does not use or want bidets . 
  who 's we ? 
  if you consider not using a bidet unclean , then surely you 'd consider not using soap unclean as well . 
  considering your flair , maybe you should take another look at the map . 
  i 'll believe your claim about being way more clean once you back it up with some data . 
  show me some evidence that the rate of diseases that can be contacted from using a toilet is higher in the netherlands than in italy . 
  until then , most of your supposed `` we are way more clean '' is in your head . 
  that said , i would support bidets everywhere because of the environmental impact of toilet paper . 
  plus it sounds easier than wiping . 
  btw bacteria does n't disappear when you use a bidet ; it 's on the toilet seat , on doorhandles , on phones , everywhere . 
  you can even find fecal matter on your toothbrush if it 's in the same room as a toilet . 
  bacteria is n't just on bathroom doors , it 's on any door . 
  do you use your sleeve to open any door , or touch anything that gets touched by other people ? 
  i 'm not watching people open doors , but pretty much every time i 've seen people do it , they used their hands . 
  why do you think your hands get super dirty just from touching your penis ? 
  do n't you shower ? 
  it should n't be that dirty , soap should n't be necessary . 
   this is also why you 'll see signs in restaurant bathrooms in the us stating that employees must wash their hands before returning to work - because bacteria from fecal matter , blood , or whatever else people come in contact with in public bathrooms can make people sick . 
  those rules apply to food workers here as well , that 's just a first world food safety thing , not really special to the us . 
  even if you 're not a food worker and you do n't wash with soap after a piss , you can still wash your hands with soap before touching food . 
  that 'd be smart to do since there are bacteria everywhere . 
  this went from ` do you use soap and water after taking a piss ? ', 
  to ` do you , as a food worker , use soap and water after taking a piss in a public bathroom ? 
   is exactly why the dutch are so dirty . 
  this is the anti-dutch comments i 'm talking about . 
  not using soap after a piss does n't make you more dirty . 
  touching your penis does n't make you dirty . 
  water does the job just fine . 
  you 'd think diseases would be far more common in the netherlands when i read comments like yours , but they 're not . 
  there are far more bacteria on your phone than your penis , if you shower daily that is . 
  stop being so emotional about this and be a little more reasonable . 
  okay . 
  that seems like a better way to clean it , environmentally as well , both toilet paper works fine too . 
  no worries :d if bacteria bothers you a lot i suggest using a wet wipe on your laptop/mouse/keyboard / phone every now on then , a lot of stuff builds up on those things because we use them so much . 
   when opening the door of a public bathroom to exit , you use one of the tissues you save from drying your hands . 
  if they have only that weird rotating towel , than i use my sleeve to open the door handle , assuming i ca n't simply push it . 
  i 've never seen anyone do this . 
  a lot of bathrooms here have electric dryers as well , or those thick paper towels that do n't come off , but you can pull on it for a clean/dry part . 
  then again i 'm not really watching how people open bathroom doors . 
  what about other doors though ? 
  people do n't just get bacteria on their hands from touching bathroom doors , it 's from anything that many people touch . 
  you 're not going to tell me you use your sleeve for every door , are you ? 
  i hope you never touch anyone 's phone either because those are riddled with bacteria , a lot more than your penis is ( i hope for you :p ) . 
   many modern public bathrooms these days have no doors , and hide the activity inside through a simple maze design , which i definitely prefer . 
  i know the maze design you 're talking about , but usually there 's still a door before it in my experience . 
  different countries though . 
   i doubt this is ocd , more like strong ingrained habits . 
  i 'd understand the habit of using soap , but going to a pharmacy just because you did n't have soap for one time ? 
  it sounds excessive to say the least , and an ocd was the first thing that came to my mind when i read that part . 
  some of the comments do n't seem like jokes at all . 
   and i can recount seeing at least 2 of them washing after using the bathroom at work . 
  everyone here washes their hands after using the bathroom , that 's obvious , but the question is if they use soap , which some people do n't , mostly because it 's unnecessary . 
  the question does n't even specify public bathrooms . 
  that makes a difference for me at least , because when i use a public bathroom i use soap , but not when i use the bathroom at home , because i know the bathroom at home is pretty clean . 
  i know my penis is pretty clean too , so a clean bathroom combined with a clean penis leads to me finding it unnecessary to use soap just for a piss . 
  your hand will probably get far more bacteria on them when you open the door to a public bathroom , than when you touch your penis . 
  and you do that when you leave a bathroom too , after washing with soap . 
  this is assuming you shower . 
  it can be the same for your home bathroom , depending how frequently you clean it . 
   i was once in a bathroom stall in the airport that ran out of soap , i had to go to a pharmacy and buy some anti-bacterial wipes , but i still felt dirty and uncomfortable the whole flight . 
  ok , that sounds like an ocd to me . 
  you do you though . 
  you 're overreacting .
