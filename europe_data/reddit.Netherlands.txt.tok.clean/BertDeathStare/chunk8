  what 's disgusting to me is all the anti-dutch comments in this thread . 
  if you came here and shook hands with everyone you met ; nothing would happen , your health would remain the same . 
  cool , we do the same . 
  did n't know italy was that advanced , 
  is your penis that dirty ? 
  ca n't even touch it without needing soap ? 
  do n't people shower ? 
  this is getting blown out of proportion . 
  be careful saying that around here , people do n't like different opinions and they downvote on sight , 
  alright , i shower every day so i 'll be fine , do n't worry about it . 
  in a public bathroom i do use soap , that 's different . 
  at home i use water . 
  we do keep our bathroom clean , if it was dirty like public bathrooms often are i 'd probably use soap . 
  that 's what i do and getting a lot of downvotes for it lol , as is reddit tradition . 
  you 'd think my country would be some kind of disease-ridden shithole when you read the comments here . 
  water for piss , soap for shit , nothing to lose your mind about . 
  not using soap after a piss , world 's worst crime . 
  there 's really no need to soap up every time you go for a piss , water will do just fine . 
  go ahead and stop using soap after a piss from now on , as long as you 're not pissing on your hands you 're not going to get sick . 
  i 've been fine all my life . 
  i really like the name ` novgorod ' , does it sound like that in russian too ? 
  by going to the toilet do they mean a number 1 or a number 2 ? 
  if it includes number 1 's i can understand the percentage , i just wash my hands with water after taking a piss . 
  well there are certain conditions before they can apply for membership : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copenhagen_criteria if it was as easy as `` just let them in '' , turkey would be a member by now . 
  there 's still a lot of [ corruption ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index#2015 ) they have to deal with first , and of course the whole situation with the seperatists and russia . 
  wrong !, 
  sad !, 
  i have the best words . 
  that 's too bad , but even without the us my comment stands . 
  there 's also a huge difference between russia supporting seperatists in ukraine , and attacking a nato member . 
  i think they 'd support us . 
  if they do n't , then it 's pointless for the us to be in nato , and the us becomes an unreliable ally even to non-nato us allies ( japan , sk , taiwan ) . 
  eu countries would also increase military spending if there was a real threat from russia . 
  the eu is also russia 's largest trading partner , their economy would take a big hit . 
  they even import food from the eu , people do n't usually keep supporting their government when their supermarket shelves are empty . 
  our nato allies canada , turkey , and of course the us are also a force to be reckoned with . 
  even with trump as president , i think we can count on the us if it ever comes to it . 
  but i strongly doubt it ever will , there 's simply nothing to gain from war with the eu/nato , and everything to lose . 
  did n't read the whole thing but with ctrl + f ` france ' i did find this :  france 775 points . 
  out of the top 10 after reducing formerly liberal access to specialist services around 2009 . 
   furthermore , even the strong winners of past years ' rankings have been turning to restrictive measures : france , for example , was restraining access in 2007 , which resulted in waiting times , and therefore worse score ( together with not really brilliant results in the e-health sub-discipline ) . 
  a fresh who report would be nice though . 
  yeah i thought he was being salty :p hard to read sarcasm sometimes in text . 
  according to the ehci france ranked first in 2006 , but went down after that while other countries went up . 
  if it changes as much for the who as it did for the ehci , 17 years can make a lot of difference . 
  you can see the timeline on page 33 : http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/ehci_2015/ehci_2015_report.pdf, 
  it 's just friendly banter , do n't take it too seriously . 
  she realises he 's engaging in playground bullying , and she does n't let him or his dog intimidate her . 
  putin could learn some maturity and respect from her . 
  and how exactly does she get her ass kicked ? 
  afaik germany is doing far better economically and it 's just a better country as a whole , not just for its citizens but also for its neighbors . 
  better living standards , better human rights record , better treatment of the press , safer , higher life expectancy , i can go on . 
  why should merkel be afraid of putin ? 
  germany is even a very well-liked country in europe and even globally . 
  can hardly say the same about russia .

  in the end , russia wishes they were germany . 
  there is even a third account in this thread that is 23 days old , and another named `` donaldfuckedhilary '' which is 19 days old . 
  lots of new accounts here in / r/europe . 
  pretty pathetic if people are making several accounts to make it seem like others agree with them . 
  i guess this sub is just a target for some people . 
  quote from merkel about that : [ ' i understand why he has to do this -- to prove he 's a man , ' she told a group of reporters . 
  ` he 's afraid of his own weakness . 
  russia has nothing , no successful politics or economy . 
  all they have is this .

  thanks, 
  thanks, 
  what does your username mean ? 
  for the rest of the world ( national ) : http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_global_homicide_book_web.pdf rates start at page 122 and you can turn it sideways for readability at the top-right corner of the page . 
  generally the safest regions seem to be europe ( minus the baltics and eastern europe ) , east asia , and oceania ( minus papua new guinea ) . 
  most dangerous would be central america ( plus mexico ) , south america , and sub-saharan africa . 
  these rates exclude killings from war . 
  just too cold/depressed there , plus alcohol ? 
   from our point of view , ukrainians are killing each other in a civil war , which started because eu and us funded revolution and support them now . 
  right , all the fault of the west , that 's such a russian perspective indeed . 
  it has nothing to do with the ukrainian people feeling angry at their corrupt president moving away from the eu , and cozying up the russia , despite the people wanting closer relations with the eu . 
  nothing to do with the president [ abusing his power ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1zxxtkn.jpg ) and disregarding human rights . 
  nothing to do with russia starting a trade war with ukraine to stop them from signing the deal with the eu . 
   russia is as responsible as your countries . 
  i do n't think they 're the same , only one country annexed ukrainian territory after all . 
  at first of course russia did n't want to admit it , but soon enough the truth came out . 
  as i see it , the only reason this civil war lasted this long is because of russia . 
  if ukraine did n't border russia , there 'd be no material aid or russian `` tourists '' to help the seperatists . 
  if russia keeps this up they might end up with no friends left in europe , maybe even the dictatorship belarus will turn its cheek some day . 
  after all , everyone else is wrong , russia is just a poor victim . 
  though if belarus one day decides to improve relations with the west , i think russian tourism will ` explode ' there as well . 
  you remind me : friet and patat . 
  friet people should be deported to belgium . 
   til that holl the netherlands have a bible belt . 
  we even had our very own bible belt measles outbreak :d http://i.imgur.com/msh0rwq.png, 
  germoney always welcome here , now gibs more plz, 
  thanks , i hope you will continue making these kind of posts in / r/europe . 
  very interesting . 
  you seem knowledgeable so i have some questions if that 's okay : you mentioned rape was a capital crime , how did they go about proving the guilt of the accused ? 
  were there courts and lawyers ? 
  and did they rely on hard evidence , or would a few witnesses be enough to get someone executed ?
