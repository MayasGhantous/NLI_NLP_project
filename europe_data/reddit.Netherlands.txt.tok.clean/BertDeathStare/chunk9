  how common was petty or violent crime in rome or the roman empire ? 
  who was responsible for arresting suspects or solving crimes ? 
  i 'm thinking a lot of crimes went unpunished , because even today with forensic evidence a lot of murders go unsolved . 
  is this part of the / r/italy cake war ? 
  i remember something like that a while ago . 
   oh really ? 
  tell me more , because you seem to know more about my country than i do . 
  you needed me to tell you that ? 
  are you a serbian living abroad or are you just lying to yourself ? 
  i do n't have to be serbian to know anything about serbia . 
  i do n't have to try to understand it either ; i consider it vile to treat a minority group like this , and i do n't consider putin a man worthy of respect either , he 's an authoritarian oligarch who has no concern for human rights . 
   you also seem to understand serbians ' opinions , ideologies and views better than me by reading news articles online . 
  interesting never claimed i do . 
  but just because you 're serbian does n't automatically mean you can convince me with your opinions . 
  what you 're attempting here is known as an appeal to authority ( fallacy ) . 
  i 'd rather rely on polls , surveys , research , reports , etc. 
  stuff like [ this ] ( http://www.undp.org/content/dam/serbia/publications%20and%20reports/english/undp_srb_ad%20survey_2013.pdf ) . 
  more on the article in his comment . 
  it 's also not really a secret that russophilia is very common in serbia , and that there 's a lot of social stigmatization or downright discrimination towards lgbt people . 
  you replied an awful lot for someone not interested in arguing . 
  okay , remind me of the things i said about serbia . 
  anti-west/eu and pro-russia ? 
  [ they are . 
  ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-s-youth-is-getting-more-eu-sceptic-07-28-2016 ) if they became an eu member , they 'd probably be one of the most anti-west/eu and pro-russian members . 
  what else ? 
  intolerant towards gays ? 
  i 'm sure you 're aware of attitudes towards homosexuals in serbia , but just in case :  the findings lead us to conclude that there is substantial likelihood of discrimination against lgbt people ( 49 percent of those polled agree with the statement that homosexuality is a disease that should be treated ) , [ pdf ] ( http://www.undp.org/content/dam/serbia/publications%20and%20reports/english/undp_srb_ad%20survey_2013.pdf ) what else ? 
  that i was n't sure how good their infrastructure is , but that it would surprise me if it was good as you say ( so good that it stands out to you ) because it 's not that developed as a country . 
  and again , that 's not a claim , it 's just logical reasoning . 
  so i did n't really say `` an awful lot '' about them after all . 
  just 3 things , 2 of which are claims that are accurate . 
  forgive me for not knowing the infrastructure of serbia , that 's just general knowledge . 
  i can talk about things that i do know about serbia , can i not ? 
  i did say i 'm not sure about their infrastructure , so i never claimed it was bad , just that it makes sense that it 's not that good since serbia is n't that developed . 
   but that is exactly what is going to happen . 
  and here i 'm not talking about equal marriage . 
  well yeah , about half of the eu does n't have equal marriage still , and the countries that do have it pushed for it themselves . 
  the eu is n't forcing any country to have equal marriage . 
   i 'm talking about refugees no country is forced to have refugees either . 
  they do however have to abide by international law , which is to accept refugees and process them . 
  whether they 're actually refugees , or whether this law is effective or not is not the fault of the eu . 
  the vast majority of refugees go to neighboring countries like jordan , lebanon , turkey anyway . 
  the refugees that do go to europe mostly go to germany and sweden , countries that allow it themselves . 
   and sanctions against russia . 
  well we 're a political and economic union , if the majority of members vote for sanctions then it 's fair that it goes through . 
   i have said nothing about looking up to serbia . 
  i just like serbia . 
  it 's a nice country with good infrastructure and nice people . 
  okay , not sure if they have good infrastructure though . 
  it would certainly surprise me , as they 're one of the least developed countries in europe . 
  if it was n't a discussion topic there would n't be things like this happening :  [ germany 's 16 states on friday voted in favor of a resolution entitled `` marriage for all - resolution for the completely equal treatment of same-sex couples , '' forwarding the motion to chancellor angela merkel 's coalition and urging them to make it a law in the lower house of parliament . 
  those in favor of the motion , led by lower saxony state , mustered 40 votes in the council chamber - well above a majority threshold of 35 - and demanded an end to discrimination , including law allowing gays to adopt children . 
  ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-upper-house-favors-same-sex-marriage/a-18514008 ) why are there pushes for marriage if it 's just semantics ? 
  why does merkel keep rejecting it if it makes no difference ? 
  clearly it 's more than semantics . 
  sorry but your `` i know gay people '' anecdote is n't convincing . 
  it 's super late and i have to go to bed now . 
  i 'll respond tomorrow if you responded to this . 
  how do you know it does n't make a difference for lgbt germans ? 
  perhaps it does n't make a big enough difference enough to protest for ( though i do n't know if they do or not ) , but there 's a symbolic difference in gay people being unable to marry like straight people can . 
  it 's like saying `` you 're equal to straight people , just not equal enough to get married like them . 
  you get civil partnerships , equal but seperate . '', 
  it 's only a matter of time before it gets changed to marriage . 
  i mean what 's stopping germany now ? 
  merkel not wanting to lose votes ? 
  even out of her voters the majority support legalizing gay marriage . 
  i guess she does n't want to lose support from her older more conservative voters who oppose it . 
  ah ok , thanks . 
  i think for the lgbt people there 's still a difference though , even if only symbolic . 
   in germany adoption is the only thing except name were differences exist . 
  sorry , i do n't understand this sentence . 
   i know a different poll and would have to look it up but i 'm on my mobile okay , yougov is a pretty reliable source though . 
  not necessarily , some countries that legalized gay marriage only legalized lgbt adoption years later . 
  it can even be the other way around ; austria does n't have same-sex marriage , but does allow lgbt adoption . 
  it 's reasonable to think that lgbt adoption has less support than marriage , but even for that there 's [ majority support ] ( https://yougov.de/news/2015/05/29/mehrheit-der-deutschen-fur-ehe-fur-alle/ ) . 
   goes without saying . 
  my point was that there are enough counterweights in the eu already , and it creates enough division as it is . 
   it absolutely is . 
  but rather more divided than more things being pushed through . 
  even though i think equal marriage is a good thing , and i do n't think being divided in a union is something positive , i will agree with you that we should n't force members to change in ways they do n't want to . 
  it should be up to their people . 
  btw you responded to my question but did n't answer it . 
  it 's not exactly a country i 'd look up to myself , that 's why i 'm curious . 
  but there are polls who specify `` same-sex marriage '' and even those get a majority in favor . 
  well not every eu country is like denmark , and to me it feels like the eu is divided enough as it is . 
  i do n't even want to know what russia is , if you consider the eu authoritarian . 
  germany should just get it over with already , the majority already [ support ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_germany#public_opinion ) it . 
  it 's going to happen sooner or later , why stall ? 
  perhaps it would have an impact on austria and switzerland as well , considering there 's a similar level of support for it there . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , what in particular do you like about serbia ? 
  it seems like a polar opposite of denmark ; anti-west/eu , pro-russia , not a very gay-tolerant population , things like that . 
  i was [ surprised in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5hvvis/serbia_on_its_way_to_the_eu_to_open_2_more/db3x19b/ ) that even many young serbians are against eu integration , i thought it would be different for the younger generations . 
  maybe it 's too soon to expect the serbian people to change their hearts towards the west/eu , after all it has n't been that long since the kosovo war . 
  even if the politically correct get what they want , we 'll still have sinterklaas , the pieten will just come in many colors . 
  the kids are n't going to notice or care as long as the presents and candies stay . 
  i have n't seen the movie but i think she was abducted to bulgaria and this scene is where she 's told that :p, 
  [ you are in bulgaria !,
