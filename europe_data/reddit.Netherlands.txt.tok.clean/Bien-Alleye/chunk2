  one little step ? 
  it 's the biggest defeat isis has suffered so far . 
  far from little . 
  what are those abnormalities then ? 
  if you have an y chromosome you are a man . 
  does n't matter how many you have . 
  if you do n't you are a woman , does n't matter how many x chromosomes you have . 
  there are as far as i know no exceptions . 
  but feel free to enlighten me . 
  allow immigration but demand integration would be my guess . 
  left does n't want immigrants to integrate ( that is what multiculturalism means ) , right does n't want immigrants to immigrate ( close all the borders ) . 
  this ; the dutch anthem if fully sung takes about 15mins . 
  generally only the first stanza is sung and the sixth as well . 
  but never fully . 
  translation of the article : ** after the attacks in brussels an european cia is still far away ** `` there needs to be an european cia '' , says the belgian guy verhofstadt , leader of the liberal fraction in the europarlement . 
  `` in such a central intelligence service all information about terrorists has to be bundled . '', 
  after the attacks in brussels the american minister of foreign affairs john kerry also called for `` an more intensive cooperation of intelligence services '' . 
  the belgian political scientist hendrik vos says in the nos radio 1 news that he is also a proponent of an european intelligence service . 
  `` terrorists do n't care about borders . 
  they buy kalasjnikovs in the first country , plan an attack in the second , and then hide in the third . 
  de secret services in the meantime are in their own capital cities , with their own intelligence network . 
  this is not effective . '', 
  ** why is n't information being shared ? 
  ** `` after the attacks in new york , madrid , london , paris , istanbul and now brussels european leaders said the same thing again and again : ` we have to better cooperate , from now on we will start with the systematic sharing of information . ', 
  in practice nothing really happens . 
  the european intelligence service are apparently not willing to shared information with each other on their own initiative . '', 
  ** what is the level of the belgian intelligence service ? 
  ** `` the belgian intelligence services are understaffed . 
  i think there are few intelligence services that relatively employ so few people . 
  that automatically makes it harder to collect and exchange information . 
  after the attacks in paris the belgian intelligence service was of course also blamed for failing to pass information on towards france . '', 
  ** are the attacks in brussels the cause for beter cooperation ? 
  ** `` i think that also now the leap towards a collective european intelligence service will not be made . 
  an european cia is still far away . 
  even so you notice that european leaders are starting to realize that it can not go on like this . 
  more information is being shared then ever before , but it is still too little . '', 
   what germany and the netherlands have been doing is unprecedented in this respect , giving full command over military units away . 
  the netherlands made the decision to sell the jss even before it was completed . 
  after it had done an ebola mission without even being commissioned the decision was made to reverse the sale only and if only an international partner could be found . 
  the kriegsmarine has been asking for ( long range ) amphibious capabilities for years but berlin never wanted to pay for it . 
  both countries found each other where they could keep capabilities on paper , bot not have to pay for it . 
  this is being presented as both countries gaining capabilities and the egg of columbus of cooperation . 
  call me cynical when i do not believe this was done out of any strategic consideration whatsoever . 
  especially if you remember that the jss was originally build to replace our 2 tankers , not to ferry germans . 
  oh and those pledges ? 
  we all pledged to spent 2 % military budget , with an 20 % investment rule , for nato . 
  several times . 
  after the cold war ended . 
  see how that is going . 
  money is the leading factor not strategy . 
  it may be justified by strategy but that does n't mean it is the reason why . 
  look international cooperation and integration is fantastic ( honestly i 'm for an european army , with sovereignty over it at national level ) . 
  but it has to be done for the right reasons , not because it 's cheaper / political convenient . 
  those decisions are not driven by ideology but as an effort to save cost . 
  i.e is done because it 's cheaper not because it 's better . 
  now it may be better as well and it 's an very interesting discussion in itself , how and to what degree should we co-operate , inter-operate , or inter-grate . 
  but that is not happening right now , so i 'm apprehensive about any calls towards an unified defense plan . 
  honestly , southern-limburg is shrinking and shrinking population wise . 
  it could use a new source of revenue . 
  maastricht sees it 's fair share of ( local ) tourists but the rest ... 
  but as long as politicians think only the randstad exist nothing is going to change . 
  seriously amsterdam gets $ 145 , the hague gets $ 81 and rotterdam gets $ 31 per capita on culture . 
  zeeland , brabant and limburg get $ 1,33 per capita .

  not really . 
  ij developed out of the long i ( compare english and respective german/french pronunciation of berlin/paris ) . 
  in ye olde days they did n't put dots on the i and to indicate the long i they would write ii and make the second i a tad longer --  ij . 
  this is also the reason why the unstressed suffix - lijk is pronounced as - lik ( compare mogelijk , gebruikelijk etc. 
  ijsselmeer is a fresh water reserve . 
  draining it further would potentially be desastreus in periods of droughts . 
  it 's a correct estimation . 
  no people hate islam , not muslims . 
  people hate an idea , not the people that hold those ideas . 
  by not differentiating between those you force people to either embrace islam or hate muslims . 
  and if you make people choose between ` us ' or ` them ' its always going to be ` us ' . 
  so by constantly calling ( il ) legitimate criticism or concerns regarding an idea racist ( or whatever ism you like ) you tell people that these ideas are inherent to a people ( like skin color or sex ) and that the people therefore are inherently bad . 
  you are not only legitimizing racism but forcing people to be racist . 
  if the pot at the end of the rainbow is shiny enough people will pursue it , no matter the risk . 
  this is the problem with this referendum , the brexit referendum , [ the 2005 referendum ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv715js9_ta ) etc. 
  the pro-europe side is all about project fear . 
  and people are feeling blackmailed . 
  the amount of nonsense that goes along with this referendum is staggering . 
  not enough money being allocated , the yes side saying nobody should go voting as to not getting to the 30 % . 
  municipalities deciding that there is not enough interest so they cut down on the amount of voting booths ( and putting the money they got in their own pockets ) . 
  and the last in the list was giving voting advise with the voting pass in some municipalities . 
  if you want people to vote yes explain why in positive terms . 
  not why no is such a bad idea . 
  reminds me of the story of the mount everest . 
  i quote from wikipedia :  peak xv ( measured in feet ) was calculated to be exactly 8,839.2 m ( 29,000 ft ) high , but was publicly declared to be 8,839.8 m ( 29,002 ft ) in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 8,839.2 metres ( 29,000 ft ) was nothing more than a rounded estimate ( in feet ) . 
  waugh is therefore wittily credited with being `` the first person to put two feet on top of mount everest '' . 
  the problem with the left is that they think our speech is violence and their violence is speech . 
  [ the chaos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfrsvtsy0d4 ), 
  there used to be a big gas bubble under groningen , very dangerous , very flammable . 
  yet people lived on top of that for thousands of years . 
  nuclear waste storage uses the same logic . 
  stuff it underground where it does n't hurt anyone and it can just sit there for thousands of years . 
  this !, 
  by bitching about merkel doing wrong people take attention away from their own lack of doing right . 
  nothing stops the other 27 states to honor the agreement without hungary participating . 
  it 's a shame , but better to be pragmatic about it .
