  beggars are very uncommon in the netherlands . 
  most people that are have refused every opportunity for help ( due to mental/drug issues ) or are part of an organised begging effort ( often foreign ) . 
  i.e not much reason to have sympathy . 
  now add to that that these are football fans which are a special kind of twat and you get this behavior . 
  despicable . 
  i hope psv identifies them and bans them from ever showing their ugly mugs again in their stadium . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u4iecc3xr0 ) you go . 
   the name is the cultural property of the greek people . 
  and you accuse me of saying american things when you talk about cultural property - . - yes the people living in hellenic macedonia are mostly ethical greeks , and yes the people living in republic macedonia are mostly of slavic origin . 
  this does not mean however that the people in greek macedon are direct descendants of macedon/alex . 
  most of them have emigrated to the region from other parts of greece during the over 2000 years since the incorporation into the roman empire and present day . 
  furthermore these slavs live within the borders of the ancient kingdom of macedon . 
  and for me that gives them enough claim to the name . 
  because i view countries as a geographical thing . 
  honestly i could n't care less about what they call themselves but `` the former yugoslav republic of macedonia '' just sounds stupid . 
  who want to have former in their country name ? 
  further more the name still implies macedonia . 
  federal republic of germany is shortened to germany . 
  kingdom of the netherlands is shortened to the netherlands etc. 
  so why not shorten the former yugoslav republic of macedonia to just macedonia ? 
  macedonia . 
  germany calls itself deutschland even though the dutch do n't live there , grand-duchy of luxembourg can coexist with the belgian province of luxembourg etc. 
  now i do not know to exact history of the region but the greek seem petty to me on this issue . 
  just call one republic macedonia , and the other one hellenic macedonia if you need to make a difference . 
  the term feminist has always been deceptive . 
  a feminist want women to have all the rights men have . 
  now this sounds good , but it does not paint the whole picture . 
  for instance if a woman has a right that a man does n't have then historically feminist have not supported giving that right to men . 
  furthermore feminists have always been opposed to equal duties . 
  and this is important because the rights of men have always been given on the basis of a duty . 
  so for instance in the uk in case of a divorce it used to be the case that the father had the right to the children , this was balanced with the fact that the father had the duty to provide for the family . 
  early feminist protested this stating that it was detrimental to a womans happiness if she was separated from her children and they got the default to change to the children going with the woman . 
  however the duty to provide for the family left with the father and thus alimony was born . 
  in the us for instance the right to vote was balanced with the duty to serve , militarily or civil ( commandeered into a bucket brigade for instance ) . 
  this was confirmed in supreme court as late as 1917 . 
  women had no duty to serve and thus no right to vote . 
  when women got right the vote they did not get the duty serve . 
  even today men have to sign up for the draft to get the right to vote , while women do not . 
  my advise is to stick with your beliefs and not with a label because feminism in essence is n't about ( legal ) equality between men and women and never has been . 
  if you do n't want to force women out of the kitchen does n't automatically mean that you want to do the opposite . 
  if you do n't want to present homosexuality as normal ( it 's natural , not normal ) does n't mean you want to ban it . 
   in this situation it 's much more likely that the man will continue working while the woman stays home and takes care of kids . 
  and why is this a bad thing ? 
  our genes are pretty much the same as they where thousands of years ago . 
  it 's natural behavior for women to prefer their children over their career and it is natural for men to do the opposite . 
  this is not a social construct but how we have evolved . 
  it is important to remember that when you generalize groups of people you can not apply that 1 on 1 to individuals but on average you can make predictions . 
  just like on average men are stronger then women , does n't mean the strongest woman is weaker then the weakest man . 
  we must not make the mistake we made in the past and enforce these gender roles , but we should n't deny them either . 
  i.e we should not force the woman into the kitchen , but we should not force her out either . 
  right now we are doing the latter , and it seems that afd opposes that . 
  i wish [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iaeuwhvi2y ) had an european version :  was ist des deutschen vaterland ? 
  in all seriousness though i think to stay competitive in the world europe needs to present itself as one to the outside otherwise we will be at the mercy of washington/moscow/beijing / ( next superpower ) . 
  and we have even less of a say there than in brussels . 
  i want to be represented in the highest office of this world and be able to dictate our future . 
  my biggest gripe with the eu is that all euro-skeptic parties are hellbent on dismantling the eu . 
  imagine if the opposition in your own country only cared about dismantling your country , and you do n't agree with the ruling party ... yeah , that is how it feels to me . 
  i wish there was a truly european wide nationalist party in the spirit of pvv-ukip-fn that is anti-immigration , anti-globalisation etc. 
  but pro-european . 
  now we are stuck in this limbo where you either hate all immigration or you love all immigration . 
  every european is welcome in my country , our cultures are compatible enough to be considers different races of the same species . 
  and even though there might be some uncomfortable moments we will be able overcome our differences . 
  i however do not believe in a multi-cultural society but i do not mind a multi-colored society . 
  you either become european or you fuck off . 
  it is as simple as that . 
  if your behavior is within the law it is accepted , if it is n't it is n't . 
  no exceptions for religion as they only create double standards . 
  we are all equals before the law . 
  the first line of the wikipedia article you 've linked uses it : ' \u021a\u0103rile de jos ( denumite informal olanda ; \u00een ** neerlandez\u0103 ** nederland , \u00een frizon\u0103 nederl\u00e2n ) [ ... ] . 
  nem\u010dija derives from proto-slavic n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c meaning foreigner ( from adjective n\u011bm\u044a ` mute ' and suffix - \u044cc\u044c ) . 
  honestly the uk ( which is basically england with 84 % pop and 54 % area ) is one country with slightly more autonomous provinces called scotland , wales and northern island attached to it ( plus various bits and bobs around the world of course ) from an outsider perspective . 
  from wikipedia :  constitutionally , the united kingdom is de jure a unitary state with one sovereign parliament and government . 
  however , under a system of devolution ( or home rule ) adopted in the late 1990s three of the four constituent parts of the united kingdom , wales , scotland and northern ireland , voted for limited self-government , subject to the ability of the ** uk parliament in westminster ** , nominally ** at will ** , to amend , change , broaden or ** abolish ** the national governmental systems . 
  as such the national assembly for wales ( cynulliad cenedlaethol cymru ) is not de jure sovereign . 
  meh , i disagree with the \u0444 over \u043f\u0445 , especially since you decide to do a one to one letter conversion for everything else . 
  but i do n't speak bulgarian so what do i know . 
  so how would you go about building such an army in such a way that you do n't have a force like the us ? 
  or is the only difference a political decision to invade made by the governmental body entrusted with that decision , meaning that there is no difference between an offensive and a defensive army . 
  that does n't answer the question what the difference in composition is between a defensive and an offensive army . 
  neither does that enlighten me how you ensure that an invasion of irak is made impossible . 
  nor infact do you enlighten me what defending europe actually entails . 
  what i ask of you is how do you build a defensive army and what differentiates it from building a offensive army . 
  both materially and legaly . 
  what is exactly the difference between an offensive and defensive army ? 
  you need to hit enemy supply lines , factories , military bases etc. 
  to win a defensive war and you need to defend your own factories , bases , supply lines etc. 
  to win a offensive war . 
  we do n't live in napeolonic times where you can just build a fortress and expect it to hold the enemy at bay . 
  so what does your defensive army entail ? 
  and what does it exclude as to not make it an offensive one ? 
  it is the motto of the house of orange . 
  when the netherlands became a monarchie in 1815 the royal motto became the national one aswell . 
  they did n't teach you this at school ? 
  nor do you own a passport ? 
  i guess that goes to show how much your phd is worth . 
  he was n't asked about annexation though . 
  just what brittians reaction was to the fact that gibraltar might fall outside a eu-uk trade deal . 
  no questions of war , falklands etc. 
  netherlands actually has a lower fatality rate then germany has , not higher . 
  the dutch word for patriotism is patriotisme or vaderlandsliefde , literally meaning fatherlandlove .
