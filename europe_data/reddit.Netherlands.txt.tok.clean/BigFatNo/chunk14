  you do n't need a horse when you can ride all the studs with god 's consent . 
  no , it says `` kloook-klok-klok '', 
  it 's also \u0430\u043f\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0438\u043d so apjelsin in russian, 
  well , yes , but you can hardly call it indonesian . 
  it 's more of a dutch spin on east asian food , including indonesian and chinese food . 
  what people fail to realize is how diverse sweden really is . 
  i mean , in one restaurant they put pineapple on their pizza , and in the other they do n't !, 
  i know you 're joking , but it is a serious issue . 
  already before donald barged in on the world stage and started shouting about fake news , there was a lot of discontent with the media and their bias . 
  does that somehow disregard that the british did some fucked up shit in the past ? 
  what 's up with the connection between greek and dutch ? 
  i 'm s000 rand0me !, 
  it 's that [ london look ] ( https://samsquaredartistinaction.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/get-the-london-look1.jpg ), 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  what 's the difference between lead , lead and lead ? 
  why in the name of fuck `` queue '' ? 
  rhythm ? 
  tongue ? 
  necessary ? 
  wednesday ? 
  `` always in the right side of history '' . 
  gunning down zulu , other crimes committed in the colonies , starving india , starving ireland , sending tens of thousands of their own men to their deaths for no reason other than arrogance at gallipoli , mass spying , rampant propaganda ... now do n't get me wrong , the uk is like any other country on the planet . 
  everyone did good things and bad things , so i 'm not saying this out of spite . 
  it 's just that your claim of `` always in the right side of history '' is horribly incorrect and very subjective . 
  he says `` all brits are impolite '' while he is so much more rude and discriminating on top . 
  he did a sweet cruyff turn and then scored during the ec . 
  what a strange title considering the rest of the article . 
  `` far right '' is only mentioned twice : in the title and in the context of `` far-right 's marine le pen '' . 
  this is more of a `` what will this candidate mean for britain and brexit '' piece . 
  is it also oppression that men who hold a lot of power , like presidents , kings etc are forced to wear a suit with tie etc ? 
  is it also oppression that ca n't they just wear a shirt and jeans ? 
  and if it is , is a hijab inherently worse than a three-piece suit ? 
  it 's both gender-oriented , it 's both strict , it both covers up the body . 
  i think this hijab discussion , together with the discussion about sweden and hijabs in iran a while back , is fueled not by the call for gender equality and freedom , but xenophobia . 
  a hijab is different than our customs , therefore it gets treated differently . 
  today we saw / r/europe decide between hating le pen or shitting on freedom-hating countries . 
  send em in , and welcome to the party !, 
  total losers, 
  that 's amazing , i 'm laughing so much ahahaha !, 
  edit : the fucking microphone in the barrel lmao, 
  huntelaar ? 
  it 's unclear whether wilders will win , polls are n't trustworthy enough right now . 
  also no big political parties will form a government with him so the chance of wilders actually winning and being premier is very slim . 
  just google it yourself , lazybums, 
  someone let the dog out and he ate a piece of the %, 
  was it rita skeeter ? 
  yeah , great book . 
  said pretty much singlehandedly started the world history subgenre in the history faculty . 
  i know it was a joke , but islamophobia in europe is as old as islam itself, 
  good idea .

  yeah i know , i played it a lot at release . 
  i just thought it was a funny thing to exclaim . 
  what did / u/berzelus ever do to deserve that ? 
  norman age , norman expansion , norman invasions , norman colonies . 
  amazing, 
  thank mr skeltal, 
  another day , another crackpot comment by / u/xeno87 about russia . 
  i know . 
  train tracks * everywhere *, 
  looks a bit triest to me huehuehue, 
  i will never read `` number one '' normally again , not since 2016 , year of the memes, 
  they 're not wrong . 
  pakistan has been helping insurgents since the soviet war in afghanistan . 
  ca n't beat the danooontje powerrrrrr, 
  relying on the us or uk can be as well . 
  it 's geopolitics , anything goes because human lives do n't matter in the game . 
  arrogance . 
  it 's pure arrogance . 
  sure . 
  there 's a big city centre with tons of cafe 's , restaurants etc , there 's a few public swimming pools and there 's a lot of water people use for a lot of recreation . 
  that 's the official motto of almere : `` yes , but look at lelystad ! '', 
  can confirm . 
  you hear the rasamsterdammers everywhere here . 
  astana looks pretty , but in practice it 's an inefficient city with demographic problems , poverty and not so useful infrastructure . 
  almere is widely regarded as an urban planner 's wet dream . 
  free bus lanes , free bike paths * everywhere * , city planning that encourages biking and discourages car use , little to no congestion in the city itself etc. 
  yes , the centre is ugly because it was built in the 70s and 80s , but there are cool places here and there to be visited . 
  it 's no amsterdam with pretty sights everywhere you look , but it 's a fine city to live in . 
  hey . 
  bear in mind that this was made in 2008/2009 , right before the recession . 
  plans have been altered the past few years , the government and the council are much more careful in granting building rights to building companies and people . 
  there is n't unlimited money anymore . 
  the most notable new plan is something called the `` floriade '' , which is a project that will turn part of the city centre into a huge garden/public park . 
  it should be done in 2022 . 
  also , interesting fact : in the woods nearby me , there 's a small creek . 
  which is strange at first thought because this used to be a completely flat sea floor . 
  turns out the creek streams in an old riverbed , formed before the country flooded about 11000 years ago . 
  it just got preserved under the layer of clay and sand , and now the creek is back . 
  pretty low key , you wo n't see it at first glance , but it 's super fascinating . 
  hahaha , i can certainly imagine them calling you crazy . 
  as for me , i live in almere and i like it because do n't like claustrophobic cities . 
  almere has tons of nature ( compared to the rest of the country ) and there are places were you can actually see the band of the milky way if it 's new moon . 
  you 're lucky to see more than 10 stars in the rest of the western part of the country . 
  there 's plenty of space to be on your own and have time to think . 
  which is a blessing compared to amsterdam , where you have supermarkets `` to go '' everywhere so you can eat your lunch as quickly and as efficiently as you can while you walk , no-one has time , it 's loud , it 's busy , it 's cramped and it 's chaotic . 
  i will never live in amsterdam for those reasons , i just ca n't stand it compared to the quieter , calmer and more spacious almere . 
  also , i 'm in the centre of amsterdam in 40 minutes by train ( i still need to go there ) and in utrecht in 45 minutes so it 's pretty cool . 
  alright . 
  i do n't really have anything to add other than a nitpick : about the russian-japanese war , i said it was the * beginning * of the end , since it showed that european armies could be beaten by a far eastern army for the first time .
