  pretty ironic , since i have you tagged as a racist for [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/32y243/a_boastful_13yearold_boy_has_been_jailed_for_a/cqg3gyq ) comment, 
  brigading is against the redditwide rules . 
  this post is so , so clearly a brigade from another site/subreddit . 
  it should be removed . 
  and calling me a crybaby and a fascist will only make me angry , which is just sad on your part . 
  my idea of a propaganda-account is an account created for the sole purpose of spreading ideas . 
  like / u/migrantproblems . 
  do n't see why you 're worried , i only want / r/european and stormfront people who are here to spread hatespeech and recruit people for their racist ideas gone . 
  which stormfront forum has brigaded us this time ? 
  this is fucking bullshit , ca n't believe the mods have n't removed this obvious brigade from a one-purpose account yet, 
  stop infesting this subreddit with your bullshit propaganda . 
  fuck off to your own forum and stay there, 
  you do know that the reason stormfront is here is to recruit people ? 
  they are here to spread hate , and i 'm all for freedom of speech but not if it 's hatespeech, 
  this kind of comment is easy , high-quality and mentally grown-up . 
  have an upvote . 
  `` more varied insights and experience '' is a very sugarcoated way of saying propaganda , stormfront , racism and circlejerking, 
  you know what i mean . 
  this subreddit has propaganda accounts for all kinds of stuff : stormfront , russia , ukraine mostly . 
  i have n't got you tagged as anything so i do n't see why you 're offended ? 
  well , not most , but yeah there is a part, 
  why are you speaking german ... 
  you win, 
  you meant geography right ? 
  ok i can only take you seriously for so long, 
  i hope so, 
  haha yeah , good night !, 
  hope you 're not serious lmao, 
  thank you , i do n't like it either . 
  have a nice day nonetheless !, 
  sure , i 'll edit that in too, 
  would be a good idea actually , because of the whole timezone thing . 
  you got ta have 24 hour moderation . 
  wo n't work if you mostly have eu moderators, 
  it 's in my edit, 
  well , i do have him tagged as a racist edit : and for this comment :  countless natives suffering so a bunch of bankers can make more money off slave wages for these barbarians edit2 : link to comment : http://np.reddit.com/r/european/comments/32y243/a_boastful_13yearold_boy_has_been_jailed_for_a/cqg3gyq, 
  oh come on . 
  / r/european is an alternative sub . 
  so it does n't attract europeans , it attracts people who want an echo chamber for their ( controversial ) opinions . 
  this includes nazism , islamophobia and racism . 
  the founder of that subredit was even banned from / r/europe for being a nazi, 
  people shitting on the moderators is also really annoying here . 
  it 's founded by people who were banned from / r/europe for various reasons , most of them for being racist , islamophobe and other hatful stuff . 
  yeah . 
  more moderators and an active policy of permabanning propaganda-accounts , / r/european regulars and other trolls/shitstirrers . 
  that would help . 
  ca n't say that this has been good for the quality of the subreddit . 
  what a great map, 
  what , there are actually propaganda-accounts here ? 
  not on / r/europe right ? 
  nooo , that would never happen !, 
  my unpopular opinion ? 
  this subreddit is a fucking trainwreck . 
  people here do n't trust the mods , constant circlejerking over russia , this place is infested with racists , white supremacists and islamophobes and you can all read it in this thread and the stickied . 
  and to add to this : if it 's gon na be big camps , you can make the refugees there work . 
  you can make some farms , make a first aid post , a school , a market etc. 
  make it a bit more self-sufficient so that it is n't as cost heavy for the eu . 
  ok , sure , sorry for `` whitewashing '', 
  jeez calm down , i do n't know everything about it . 
  it was just a proposal by the vvd , they want to work the plan out further . 
  the liberals here in the netherlands had a pretty good solution : make refugee camps in africa and the middle east funded and maintained by the eu . 
  the people can shelter there waiting to go to europe . 
  however the rest of the parties all denied this immediately , i still do n't understand why , i thought it was a pretty good idea . 
  solves the humanitarian crisis happening in the mediterranean . 
  germany . 
  i have german family . 
  they need our rotterdam and we need their cars . 
  they need our bitterballen and we need their wurst . 
  they need our bicycle stuff and we need their baumarkt . 
  they need our robben , we need their lahm . 
  it 's a perfect match . 
  perfect lmao !, 
  yoda is that you ? 
  yes but qualificatie , quantificatie sounds a * little * bit different . 
  it 's the difference between pronouncing it as kw or koe/ku, 
  sure i ignore them , i never said i did n't . 
  i just spoke my opinion . 
  / r/europe , actually only a circlejerk about russia and people arguing over greece . 
  tbh , i only care for the news of another country if it 's juicy or if it 's big news that affects me or my country as well . 
  i do n't want to read about a mayor from hungary ( just an example ) that has been fired , or a car accident in spain . 
  just my 2 cents . 
  ah ok , there 's bitterballen if you 're hungry !, 
  do you want slagroomtaart or chocotaart ? 
  i thought that `` comcast is literally hitler '' ? 
  the all-caps title , huge letters and general screamy look of the site put me off a lot , i must say . 
  is this site safe ? 
  happy cake day !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb0uiq4nts0 ), 
  ottoland sounds like a baumarkt in germany, 
  10/10 i love it !, 
  i 'm not / u/chemicalpleasure [ 1 ] but to me it sounds just as impractical as desalinizing sea water ( i.e. 
  we better develop that technology real soon if we want to mitigate the global warming and ocean acidification ), 
  please . 
  every new technology is hugely expensive and impractical . 
  that 's not the biggest problem at all, 
  step by step of course . 
  i just do n't like the fact that with finding more oil we think `` oh shit now we can continue the same way of living for longer ! '', 
  instead of working hard to ensure that people in 100 years and more can live just as well as we do now, 
  short term/long term thinking, 
  no , that would be very hypocritical .
