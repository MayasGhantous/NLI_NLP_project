  then , let 's get back to that institutionalized torture . 
  because that was very prevalent in europe until the end of the 18th century . 
  monarchs repeatedly had their opponents tortured and killed . 
  jacobins , who were the rulers in france for a brief period of time , were notorious in europe for their `` reign of terror '' , which included torturing and killing their opponents . 
  now , why is isis shunned these days ? 
  partly because they torture and kill their opponents . 
  so you 're projecting something as tolerant and `` civilized '' , but that thing did the same as that which you condemn as intolerant and barbaric . 
  do you see how pointless and wrong your comparison is ? 
  it just does n't make sense , and that 's why you 're putting sentiment before truth here . 
  continiuous empire  colonies here and there . 
  looks cooler on the map . 
  `` muslims are like the barbarians of that time '' oh / r/europe . 
  i weep for you . 
  at times like these it 's worse than your average news site comment sections , and that 's saying something . 
  i saw a cartoon somewhere of two centurions kicking in a door and saying something like `` time to get romanized , * bitch !, 
  noo , it 's * my * history !, 
  his friends call him `` the bulgar-slayer '', 
  resulting in a massive population growth in europe . 
  europeans loved their potatoes then . 
  we still do . 
  read up a bit more about the jacobins and their reign of terror . 
  also institutionalised torture until the end of the 18th century . 
  also slavery . 
  also wars , wars , wars , wars and more wars . 
  pls post more , that was beautiful . 
  i came , i saw , i shared . 
  dude , calling someone a `` naive idiot '' based on one comment ? 
  thank you for your reply !, 
  and there 's the problem of this map . 
  you just ca n't use modern borders to decide wich countries invaded poland in all of human history . 
  so the snow we see in this pic comes from the east ? 
  or did it come from russia ? 
  huh , i did n't know that . 
  interesting , thank you for informing me !, 
  calling this `` slanted news '' is the same as calling horror movies `` based on a true story '' . 
  3v1 and you lost ? 
  pff [ come on ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rampjaar ) . 
  there are so many mistakes on this map , it 's astonishing . 
  like / u/strzeka said : you ca n't use modern borders the way you 're doing now . 
  moldova invading poland ? 
  italy invading poland ? 
  finland * not * invading ? 
  i think the many scary radical islamic factions in syria make the assadi government look good . 
  many people have the opinion that the government is very bad , yes , but compared to isis and al-nusra they 're the lesser of evils . 
  can you imagine being so petty you need to give yourself validation on an internet forum ? 
  making merkel wait for hours is much more remarkable , though . 
  [ willy en max zijn een halve kop groter haha ] ( http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/sites/default/files/styles/landscape_2/public/content/images/2013/11/08/poetin_willem_alexander_maxima_ontmoeting_0.jpg?itok=djjcrh30 ) . 
  first of all , my apologies for the wrong assumption about you being american . 
  as for my reply : i have german family and friends and i travel there regularly . 
  merkel gets plenty of criticism from the people i know . 
  a recent example is the silvester-speech from merkel . 
  my uncle watched it and joked that everyone should be quiet because `` mutti '' was speaking . 
  he was far from serious . 
  germans are different from dutchmen and yes , they are taught to be more obediant than dutchmen , but that 's about it . 
  they 're just like you and me . 
  what you 're saying is vastly exagerrated and based on prejudice , not truth . 
  what is it with americans and the seemingly endless pile of bullshit they believe about germany ? 
  who says i use facebook ? 
  i also do n't watch got . 
  regardless , i can still be annoyed and worried about the fact that facebook forces american values on the whole world . 
  `` random quote because everyone buys into my personality cult . '', 
  churchill, 
  it 's so ridiculous , is n't it . 
  and facebook enforces this prudeness upon the rest of the world too . 
  what do you mean ? 
  yeah , thanks for the clarification !, 
  and i know there are tons of dialects , that 's why i said `` can be '' in my comment . 
  lmao what bullshit . 
  we 're apparently worse off than a country that has descended into tribal wars . 
  yeah it 's kuifje in dutch . 
  but they 're originally in french , so i thought it was more fitting to call them tintin . 
  and thanks for the correction !, 
  adolphe sax invented the saxophone . 
  la chouffe is amazing . 
  flemish accent can be very , very sexy . 
  antwerpen has a highway system where everyone wants to murder one another , but the inner city is lovely . 
  molenbeek , paradise on earth . 
  seperated from us after 1830 due to historical and religious differences and the fact that the dutch state treated them a bit bad . 
  antwerpen got shafted by us lmao . 
  edit : oh and all those cartoons : suske en wiske , ~ ~ tin tin ~ ~ tintin , and all the others i ca n't remember anymore . 
  violence only creates more violence . 
  taking the law into own hands is n't good at all here . 
  be angry at van der steur for underfunding police forces and being incompetent instead . 
  that complex is huge . 
  i love the gardens all around it !, 
  what that means is that there are a lot of people who celebrate carnaval . 
  and [ this is the result of that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqi-ejto5r8 ), 
  i once ate a sandwich from the supermarket that had chicken , lettuce and pesto . 
  shit was nauseating . 
  trust the american to look at it from far away and call for mob violence as a solution . 
  and the dutch lmao weeeeeeed, 
  i do n't see that as arrogance . 
  it 's well-known that german and dutch are very similar , so it 's logical that germans will try to use their mother 's tongue here . 
  yes , because discriminating billions of people based on religion is so enlightened . 
  he says he 'll wait for trump 's actions , and that 's interesting . 
  this puts trump in a tough spot . 
  if he does stand by the dismissing of the diplomats , russia and people who want to mend ties with russia will be angry . 
  if he reverses the dismissal , eveyone else will be angry . 
  yay , politics !, 
  why are you here if you do n't care about it ?
