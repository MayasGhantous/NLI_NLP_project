  and lastly , do you really think people will stop having abortions if it 's not provided in safe hospitals ? 
  of course . 
  just remind them of who 's the better one here . 
  he 's got [ the london look ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/emmanuel_macron_par_claude_truong-ngoc_avril_2015.jpg/266px-emmanuel_macron_par_claude_truong-ngoc_avril_2015.jpg ), 
  he looks like a character from a racing game lol, 
  how can that creepy looking fucker not be ? 
  did it involve pulling steaming passports out of a wall, 
  [ now we 're talking ] ( https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0207/1634/products/bar_towel_boxing_bear_2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1467743706 ), 
  yes but he ca n't look, 
  [ like this one ? 
  ] ( https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/mte4mdazndewnzg5odi4mtew/barack-obama-12782369-1-402.jpg ), 
  look at his arms , he 's holding them in front of him because he ca n't see , and he does n't want to bump into something snout-first, 
  or the knight is gigantic, 
  very interesting , thank you very much for the link !, 
  i 'll definitely try to pick up a book or two about this , i 'm absolutely fascinated by this !, 
  oh , now i want to go back to the c\u00e9vennes !, 
  i liked your input  this is fascinating , i 'd love to find a book collecting these historical mysteries , one that goes further than the standard `` did catherine the great fuck a horse '' . 
  these kinds of tales tread a fine line between historical writing and fiction , and that distinction is very vague anyway ( i say that as a history student , not cynically ) . 
  that 's why i love these types of stories . 
  the muscovite flag is probably the most epic on this map . 
  meanwhile in berlin : a blind walking bear, 
  that 's a very pretty flag . 
  also hovering crown ftw, 
  yes , but you all work in the famous troll factory ( tm ) so is n't it expected from you that you surf this subreddit ? 
  it 's easy to have a universal scapegoat to blame all your country 's problems on , is n't it ? 
  no doubt the su era was destructive and awful , but man up and do n't blame every single problem on it . 
  op , you have been summoned to the comment section . 
  explain your ways . 
  how can you possibly disagree about the scientific advanced of the industrial revolution, 
  erm , ever heard of the steam engine , the train , the periodic table , the evolution theory , aluminium structures , synthetic dyes , etc etc etc. 
  dude , this whole modern world is shaped by the industrial revolution . 
  90 % of the things you own is a product of innovation from that time . 
  i 'd argue that the real difference only came about during the industrial revolution, 
  no , there 's no vvvv sound of air escaping in our w. 
  no , we generally use a w for v 's in slavic loanwords, 
  we say wodka in dutch for some reason . 
  just like the wolga river . 
  assad started the civil war , but it was n't a completely unexpected development . 
  i 'd say the destructive droughts that forced thousands of people into big cities like homs , aleppo and damascus , is at least as important as a cause for the civil war . 
  there was unrest already . 
  assad helped develop it with his brutal reign , and he was the straw that broke the camel 's back in the end . 
  there was never any sign of any unity among the rebels . 
  it 's a universal queen-thing . 
  our previous queen , now princess beatrix , [ had her share of impressive hats too ] ( http://www.modekoninginmaxima.nl/sites/default/files/field/image/hoeden20beatrix2011.jpg ), 
  some parts of south america would be ideal too . 
  places like quito in ecuador have 29c and sun literally every day of the year, 
  that actually sounds pretty idyllic . 
  you know , barring the hellish inferno . 
  yay , good news !, 
  we need that from time to time . 
  you terrorised us with tasty and cheap kebab . 
  oh , the horror !, 
  politicians ca n't possibly be an expert on everything . 
  governments can not run without lobbies . 
  i agree that this kind of corrupt , malicious lobbying needs to be stopped , but banning lobbying outright is never going to happen . 
  you 've got plenty of porto , so you 'll be fine . 
  blame the british for their coal powered engines, 
  france . 
  thanks for the heads-up . 
  i have him tagged now . 
  second ljubljana . 
  fantastic , gorgeous city with really friendly people . 
  did you goo to the ljubanski castle ? 
  we all think the same about our home country , friend . 
  i always wonder why people come to this ultra flat ultra boring and densely populated hole . 
  when i went to hochsauerland with my cousin he was so surprised that his country , germany , could actually be beautiful . 
  `` i thought germany was this really boring , ugly place '' he said . 
  i have n't been to bulgaria yet , but it 's definitely on my bucket list ' !, 
  i 'd love to see the extraordinary nature and beautiful architecture . 
  how can you hate a whole nation ? 
  i 'm sorry to inform you that men are found in every country . 
  best stay in finland and move to a hut on a small lake somewhere . 
  i hope things get better for you < 3, 
  the mexicans ? 
   meritocracy , now . 
  yessur , right away sir, 
  typical reddit responses to this headline in this thread . 
  tread with caution . 
  i think he 's been very dignefied during these elections . 
  there are plenty of nazi 's here on reddit, 
  culture , but i think the history ( power vacuum , rampant corruption and crisis in the 90s ) is a bigger cause for putin . 
  man , why did they separate the village from the sea with that railroad ? 
  seems a bad move , city-planning wise . 
  this marxist titslapper will take your job and then sexually harrass you, 
  love the magic hands in the corner . 
  you ca n't see the y-axis , but that does n't take away that this looks awful . 
  a droopy finish . 
  yeah , but i still cringe at the voc mentaliteit and the meeting between bush and balkenende . 
  the way balkenende behaved himself can only be described as `` onderkruipsel '' . 
  sometimes good , like how he handled the turkey crisis , but mostly he just goes along nicely . 
  my biggest grief with him is that he 's too capitalist , and too trusting that the free market will solve everything . 
  but as far as prime ministers go , we could do a lot worse, 
  it 's a choice you have to make : do you want a witch , or a guy who laughs everything ( no seriously , everything ) off ? 
  hey / u/wearebrics , way to confirm the negative stereotypes about russians here on reddit . 
  you 're only making it worse . 
  no , it 's even better . 
  i got banned because of a comment in / r/subredditdrama . 
  i said the mods were cancer . 
  i asked for an explanation in a message to the mods ( it was a respectful message , i have to add . 
  no swearing , no anger ) , but they never replied .
