  let 's correct that a bit more : math is obsolete and experts are ~ ~ always ~ ~ wrong when it suits the populists . 
  facts are opinions , and opinions are facts . 
   that 's what france wants , and it does n't care if it comes with a racist or fascist package . 
  i 'm sure the other french here love it that you 're speaking for them . 
  ew , france , you 've got some growths there . 
  go see a doctor , please . 
  no u, 
  let 's check their post history , then . 
   does n't matter , france is done . 
  not even 3rd world immigrants want to stay there , lol . 
  just see calais . 
  which makes them extremely malleable for other terrorists . 
  it 's not hard to condition a child into being a soldier : /, 
  remember those news reports about africans storming ceuta ? 
  also here on / r/europe, 
  we do make space cake here . 
  it 's not really powder , but it 'll blow your mind regardless . 
  there you go again . 
  i 'm not in the middle . 
  i do n't condone russian aggression and i like the corruption in russia just as little as everyone else . 
  what i 'm saying is that we should n't forget that there a normal people in russia as well , and i hope we keep in contact with each other so that people know more about russia other than putin and crimea . 
  that 's all . 
  do n't use moral outrage to push me or others into your viewpoint . 
  you know , i 'm so tired of the `` you 're either with us or against us '' mentality . 
  neither / u/snowbattt nor i condone the invasion . 
  you 're putting words in other people 's mouth and it 's tiring . 
  way to omit half the quote . 
   i entirely agree that the way russia took it , is just not the way this kind of thing should be done read before you get outraged . 
  i think this is failed integration showing . 
  capitalists live inside their own segregated bubbles , they only hear capitalist news and they only read capitalist newspapers . 
  i frequent / r/russia as well , and it 's a great sub if you ignore the politics posts and only read the culture and nature posts . 
  the mods there are not good , to say the least . 
  but i fully agree with you that we need to look past the leader and the corruption and see that plenty of russians are the kindest people . 
  unfortunately it 's the corruption and putin that gives russia its face in europe , but i hope people wo n't forget that there are still people like you and me there . 
  it 's not mordor . 
  about being on friendly terms with them : it 's tough . 
  i do agree with the sanctions as a reaction to donbass and crimea , since it 's the logical thing to do . 
  but being on friendly terms from person to person is so , so important . 
  i think in these times , exchange programs are vital . 
  if we ignore each other and only hear about each other through the news , then of course we 're going to see rising tensions . 
  i remember all those staged and fake photos from the donbass area . 
  that person lost family because if franco , and you talk about `` safety '' ? 
  no , spain was not occupied by ussr , but that does n't diminish what franco did . 
  dude , ever heard of the franco dictatorship ? 
  everyone seems to think that there 's a choice to make : either you believe the western media , or you do n't . 
  and those people you talk about take this choice way too seriously . 
  they believe that because the media has an agenda ( which every channel does ) , they are never , ever to be trusted . 
  take the news with a grain of salt , but do n't take that too far . 
  me too . 
  he talks a lot but does nothing , but that does n't take away the fact that he talks well . 
  so of course i 'm going to agree with his context-less quotes . 
  fuck it , let 's name all the months after the weather again . 
  woo rational !, 
  provence is very conservative , especially when you go a bit more in land . 
  i sometimes got to talk politics with villagers in provence , the stuff they said about immigrants was pretty shocking . 
  jihadis from europe get nicknames when they join isis . 
  the al-beljiki part simply means `` the belgian '' . 
  it 's probably isis scum . 
  i like the eloquent `` tyf op/kanker op '' , myself . 
  kus mijn kloten is pretty good as well . 
  why is it called `` the forgotten war '' in the first place ? 
  yemen is a hotbed of action and conflicting interests between regional powers . 
  but the difference between the attention syria is getting versus the attention yemen is getting in western media is staggering . 
  slow down there mr badass, 
  pretending russia is a bastion of fairness and freedom is delusional , yes . 
  but i hope people keep their heads cool . 
  there are quite a few messages here on reddit ( let alone on other internetforums ) advocating for nuking russia off the map , assassining putin , calling for war and others . 
  when the russian government ( or any government ) is acting criminal , it does well to show that you are above such things . 
  no , his name is karel de grote !, 
  i read a lot of history as well and one of the main things about charlemagne is that he was one of the first to envision a united , christian europe . 
  it 's a pretty commonly stated thing . 
  hahaha `` eu takes # 350 million from us every week '' hahaha `` crush the saboteurs '' hahaha `` some fans urinated on our brave cops '' man , good old british dry humour . 
  i think nationalism is a toxic ideology and i hope you can be swayed in your beliefs . 
  ukraine has little more than a third of russias gross national income , though . 
  turks were well-regarded here , until your politicians fucked your shit up . 
  ethiopians , probably . 
  i already posted one comment , but this one deserves another : de nieuwe bibliotheek , almere : outside : [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/de_nieuwe_bibliotheek_-_library_almere_nl_001.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.almerecentrum.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/winkelenalmere.bibliotheek.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( https://prretje.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_3326.jpg ) .

  mm , that looks a lot more pleasant , you 're right . 
  generally , light to slightly darker brown wood is the way to go if you want a hall to be homely . 
  [ library of rijksmuseum , amsterdam ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5611/15315875210_1225e280eb_b.jpg ) . 
  that sein\u00e4joki library instantly gave me a very depressed feeling looking at that . 
  the bald , iron-grey concrete , the cold white lighting and the darkness outside . 
  looks interesting , but i do n't think i 'd want to spend a lot of time in there . 
  bro , chill, 
  depends on the areas , but it 's very dependant on local lighting as well . 
  when i go running at night and it 's a new moon , i can hardly see stars when i start in my block , but once i 'm in the forest a few kms to the east , i can see the band of the milky way . 
  along with a nice dystopian orange hue on the horizon , where the city centre is . 
  you choose , we decide !, 
  i propose a referendum to give the editors more power !,

  the source page is always a good place to explore a bit while doing a research . 
  it 's a good starting point . 
  it would actually be enjoyable if they were n't toying with peoples ' lives . 
  same here , friend . 
  hey , do you remember all those articles about the `` g\u00fclenists '' being jailed ? 
  guess what will happen to them when the death penalty is reinstated . 
  the death penalty in the hands of an authoritarian ruler will always result in innocents dying . 
  trump is a fool . 
  putting any trust in him at all is n't really that smart .
