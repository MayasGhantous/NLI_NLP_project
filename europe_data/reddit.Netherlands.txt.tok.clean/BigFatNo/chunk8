  * vomits *, 
  she looks too much like a plastic barbie doll to me, 
  it was in denmark . 
  they then disected it in front of kids for educational purposes and all the sissies in the western world ganged up to cry about it . 
  [ polonaaaaaiiise !, 
  ] ( https://images.drukwerkdeal.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/doorlopend.png ), 
  no , that 's still cruel . 
  they need to rile up the bull a lot first , and they do that by hurting him . 
  i think this is non-news . 
  '' * trump * says us * may * ... '' it 's all just election talk , speculation and empty words . 
  slut shaming yay, 
  it 's not simply black and white like that , though, 
  / r/ukrainianconflict is n't exactly a bastion of unbiased truth , though . 
  they 're my otp actually !, 
  looking at that areal picture , it looks horrifying . 
  pieces larger than humans are flung * so * far away from the trains itself . 
  did you not take into account i 'm a sophisticated man ? 
  with scotland leaving , they have an advance case of the decapitation blues . 
  maybe there 's a clutch fan among them ? 
  excellent idea !, 
  hello i came here to brag about my french skills . 
  am i in time ? 
  this is so terrible . 
  my thoughts go out to turkey :(, 
  this is not the time for such jokes . 
  you 're being very , very insensitive . 
  vietnam war ? 
  korean war ? 
  there 's rumours about a number of asian companies moving to amsterdam as well . 
  hey come on now . 
  if we get all of london 's wealth we can easily share it all . 
  why all the hate if we can all drive in jaguars handmade by poor , underpaid english workers ? 
  exactly . 
  that 's exactly what i feel too . 
  the arrogance of the politicians in this country , and probably in all of europe , is astonishing . 
  you know , when political parties do bad in the elections here , their first step afterwards is to say : `` apparently the people do n't understand our beliefs enough . 
  we need to explain it better next time . '', 
  it 's never their own fault . 
  they are so far removed from the people , it 's ridiculous . 
  tipping culture should n't be necessary in a well-developed country . 
  even more insulting is that we are just a piechart for * belgium *, 
  they do n't know what they 're missing out on . 
  yeah [ we have that too ] ( https://imagestoreretrieval.mitra.nl/product/front/601826/cd90f243-93e0-4b52-b7d9-740456af2dd9.png?h=350&amp;w=300 ) . 
  translates to `` liquorice shot '' , tastes like shit . 
  sweet vodka is 100 % tastier . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure i saw this post a few days ago somewhere else on reddit, 
  all those buildings built on top of really high cliffs and rocks are so impressive . 
  thanks for this picture !, 
  side note : those ivy plants on the side of the rock are really , really big . 
  that 's really interesting . 
  thanks !, 
  no , norilsk is in the middle of a treeless tundra . 
  it 's further north than the trees can grow , and the ground of the surrounding area is too polluted for any lifeform anyway . 
  it fits into the `` us vs. them '' narrative erdogan likes to use very well . 
  because this map is bullshit in every way . 
  sorry vriend , i ca n't hear you down here in my underground ... never mind , i did n't say that . 
  rule the waves ? 
  hah , do n't make me laugh . 
  yes . 
  yes , you read that wrong . 
  nothing to see here folks , jog on please . 
  hehe . 
  definitely nightwish . 
  the trick in russia is to have the singer be an insanely hot model . 
  metal singers generally are n't . 
  antwerpen is a nice place to visit too, 
  you asking for such responses when you say `` religion is a cancer on humanity '' . 
  wallonia, 
  but spain does n't really have the apocalyptic sprawl that la is known for . 
  oke jongens , can i join in ? 
  [ let 's celebrate this occasion properly ] ( http://www.gifanimaties.nl/files/animaties-gif/proost/animaties-gif-proost-3855348.gif.pagespeed.ce.66bac21pc4.gif ), 
  i think the caribbean territories are part of it as well . 
  especially aruba , being only 24 kms away from a very unstable venezuela . 
  ah right , i just went with the flair . 
  \\* blushes *, 
  shh , let them have their fun for now . 
  they deserve it once in a while . 
  but please do crush them in the euros . 
  i think gr\u00fcezi is more swiss , to be honest . 
  the * killzone * series . 
  farm products too, 
  do you also like grolsch better than belgian beers ? 
  there are only two things i ca n't stand in this world . 
  people who are intolerant of other people 's cultures ... and the dutch lmao seriously . 
  every time the netherlands get mentioned here someone thinks he 's funny and copypastes that . 
  it 's driving me nuts . 
  even i , as a dutchman , am triggered by your arrogance . 
  dude . 
  thank you !, 
  ah , alright . 
  thank you for the explanation !, 
  huh , that 's the first time i 've heard that \u0432\u044b is capitalized . 
  are there any rules for that , or is it just dependent on the context ? 
  we 'll probably never know . 
  remember singing hankiepankie sjanghai with the whole class when you were little ? 
  zorro becomes zazza, 
  * i 'm italying this text *, 
  yeah , good point . 
  the girls from serbia looked like a gang that will beat you up in a dark alley . 
  the post is apparently back now .
