we had language too :  barbarbarbarbarbarbar, 
  the seating lay out does n't look that good , but for standing it appears to be pretty okay . 
  i think they were just designed around standing , not sitting . 
   the dutch government have already accepted responsibility for their failure . 
  because the dutch government * was * responsible for putting soldiers in a hopeless situation . 
  i do n't think the soldiers were . 
  they had the right equipment back home , but the general idea was that mladic would n't attack blue helmets , never mind that they had been testing resolve for a long time and were becoming more aggressive . 
  also , it was either the british or americans ( i forgot who ) who refused to give air support to the dutch soldiers despite requests and obligations to do so , prior to the dutch surrender to serb forces -- this happened for much the same reason the ground soldiers did n't fight back . 
  the most responsible are the un planners who did not dare draw conclusions from the obvious serbian provocations and testing of resolve of un forces , and the ( dutch and un ) politicians who did not want to account for any serious threat . 
  basically the people who oversaw the operation were to blame , not soldiers . 
  the technical term is useful idiot . 
  it was known far in advance and was willingly ignored . 
  nobody is victimised beyond self-victimisation . 
  [ link from 2013 ] ( http://www.energypost.eu/the-real-prospects-for-south-stream-its-all-about-exemption/ ) , a month before euromaidan . 
  this project clearly fails the first and fifth requirement for exemption . 
  the project clearly has no legal leg to stand on ; invading another country means no amount of politicking is going to save the project . 
  to quote the article :  unless we have a clear decision on derogation applied in the south stream case , the project will remain in the sphere of wishful thinking and geopolitical contemplation . 
  so your  interesting how no one ever said this until the ukraine crisis began is without merit . 
  i understand that you are annoyed about the implications for your country . 
  but at the end of the day they willingly took part in a project without legal basis . 
  the one on the right is [ flipped ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27022548 ) , see [ my earlier comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27dl49/nsflnsfw_prorussian_separatists_execute_prisoners/ci04xsf ) . 
  i ca n't read this article , but i think i remember this conflict predating ukraine . 
  something about gazprom not being allowed to own the infrastructure if it 's also delivering the gas . 
  \\* edit : but i 'm not sure . 
  people do n't necessarily have the same earshape on both sides . 
  [ this person certainly does n't ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a8vmpxq.jpg ) . 
  you might recognise this person , [ it 's the same person as the one on the right ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27022548 ) . 
  the picture on the right is flipped , so you 're seeing opposite sides of the face of the two photos . 
  from the [ source video of your right picture ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27022548 ) , we can also totally see that his left and right ear have [ quite different shape ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a8vmpxq.jpg ) . 
  the left picture features a person that has his face turned towards the camera at a 10-20 degree angle . 
  on the left picture you can see , for example , his righter eye socket , while with the right picture the face would have turn by a lot to see the left eye socket ( remember , it is flipped ) . 
  you can also see it by the lips , of which more width is shown in the left picture , the weird shape the left chin has , his face beyond his nose/mustache in the left picture ( absolutely not visible on the right ) and , lastly , in the neck you can also see how he has his head turned . 
  there are moments in the execution video when this person faces the left entirely and is not turned away/towards the camera . 
  why did you not use such a picture ? 
  one of the benefit of using a similar picture is that you can see they share similar nose and chin structure ( in my strictly non-professional opinion ) . 
  it appears that you have made this picture comparison , or are the only one it has been given to , since there appear no copies elsewhere . 
  thus you are entirely aware of these obvious issues but have decided to not let that bother you . 
  none of this conclusively proves that the persons are the same , btw . 
  just that they have the same facial structures , hair colour and eye colour ... in so far as these potato videos allow . 
  this is not a facial fingerprint , a likeness could easily pass as the other in a potato video . 
  i wish that they spent a little bit of that high grade russian military equipment budget on decent video cameras . 
  i doubt he 's as bad as wilders . 
  his party pvv consists of two members . 
  one human , himself . 
  the other member is an entity called stichting groep wilders . 
  it has one leader , wilders . 
  there are no other administrative members and is a very secretive and closed organisation . 
  people can only join as donor and volunteer , not member . 
  i still await the day when kim jung-un non-ironically calls him out as an example of western autocracy . 
  3 % of their export is moscow bound , about 60 % goes to the european economic area . 
  meanwhile , 16 % of their import comes from russia , and about 60 % of import comes from the eea . 
  so joining a russion version of the economic zone would completely wreck their economy .

  dutch police extensively uses [ racial profiling ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/binnenland/article/detail/3534713/2013/10/28/teruglezen-de-getinte-risicoprofielen-van-de-politie.dhtml ) ( dutch article warning , [ here is amnesty international 's english summary ] ( http://www.amnesty.nl/sites/default/files/public/amnesty_stopandsearchpowersposearisktohumanrights.pdf ) ) . 
  it took us a long while to become ` tolerant ' of surinamers and indonesians . 
  it will take us a while to become ` tolerant ' of moroccans and turks . 
  but we 're really not that tolerant , most things were just circumstance , the country 's political degradation is in full swing . 
  wilders recently addressed a crowd by asking if they wanted more or less moroccans . 
  they unsurprisingly chanted `` less !, 
  less !, 
  less ! '' . 
  he started by defining his party as an answer by three question . 
  do you want less or more eu ? 
  crowd : `` less !, 
  less !, 
  less ! '' . 
  he continued by asking if they wanted more , or less labour party ( centre-left party similar to yours ) . 
  `` less !, 
  less !, 
  less ! '' . 
  then he ended with the question if they wanted more or less moroccans . 
  he says things a fucking overt racist ignorant cun would say and people vote for him . 
  the worst thing is that he 's basically just prostituting himself for whatever issue uneducated people care about . 
  when he rose to prominence , muslims were a perceived ` threat ' ( according to a part of society ) and he based everything about how savage the muslims were in his opinion . 
  according to him he was n't racist because he was only attacking religion . 
  then the eu crisis happened , so that suddenly became his issue . 
  then that issue eroded , so he went back to blaming every societal mishap on muslims again . 
  however , society had moved on , turks were no longer perceived as a big problem , so the muslim cover for xenophobia and racism did n't really work anymore . 
  but a large enough portion of people still hated moroccans , which were relatively much more criminal . 
  so he just went all-out racist and now blames most issues on them . 
  the people who vote for him are generally people that are distrustful of the established political parties and have very little education . 
  britain 's ` chav ' subculture is a reasonable analogue . 
  his voters do n't believe in most things he says and do not take his solutions seriously either , but appreciate his willingness to address the ` issue ' they feel other parties do n't address and his language is similar to theirs ( simplistic ) . 
  dutch politics has a representational system that enables a large number of parties , e.g. 
  there are 11 parties in our 150-seat house of representatives , plus 3 independents ( who coincidentally left wilder 's party because of his switch from muslim/eu hatred to ethnic hatred ) . 
  in general i prefer our system , but a main benefit to the british electoral system , in part due to first-past-the-post voting , is that there is very little place beside the two opposing centrist parties . 
  they still exist in their appropriate parties , but the main tone of the parties is ultimately centrists .
