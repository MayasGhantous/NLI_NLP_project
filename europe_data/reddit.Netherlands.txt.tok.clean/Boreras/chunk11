  based syriza policy and negotiating style producing results !, 
  spook the market , wreck the greek economy , reap your reward . 
  tsipras ' election rhetoric initially , his consequential election secondly and his behaviour afterward completely shattered market trust in the country . 
  this is entirely athens ' fault of hardballing . 
   further adversity will be seen as blackmail from those who 've been hurting them , against them and those who are trying to help them . 
  but this is such a falsified narrative . 
  half of greece 's budget in 2009 was unpaid for , so when their bonds ' yield skyrocketed to unsustainable rates , they either needed to * directly half government spending * or find some other emergency funding . 
  the latter happened , and europe covered their bills . 
  current government spending is still way , way above ( 50 % , in fact ) what it would 've been in 2010 had other countries not helped . 
  the troika is not the source of the trouble , the situation they found themselves in around 2009-2010 is the source . 
  the cause of the massive deficit was athens structurally misrepresenting their deficit and debt . 
   blame this temporary measure on the criminal behaviour of the ecb who unilaterally cut off the euro supply [ did n't they just not increase spending , keeping it at a constant level ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2015/html/pr150628.en.html ) ? 
  it 's more the ecb not wasting money on saving greek banks long abandoned by tsipras . 
  the emergency liquidity assistance is just a form of the rest of europe paying for maintaining hollow husks with greek names . 
  also , they can say it is one-to-one , but in reality the value would be much lower . 
  you can try to outlaw not maintaining the prices in the shops , but then the price in euros will just skyrocket with the inflationary ious . 
  pvda has become more centrist the last decade , but that 's more because the dutch electorate made a sharp turn to the right . 
  they are still left centrists though : http://www.pensioenbelangen.nl/phwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/grafische-weergave-door-kieskompas.jpg ( left to right axis is well left versus right , up and down is progressive and conservative ) . 
  their current leader samson became a politician through his involvement in the students ' union and campaigning for greenpeace .

  it would take some time for employment to recover add it lags behind economic growth but the tide had finally stopped rising . 
  but with syriza , greece has decided to go diving . 
  maybe you 'll find treasure , maybe you 'll drown . 
  yeah , obviously , but the origin of that afrikaans word is dutch . 
  non-native speakers are bound to make mistakes and misuse idioms . 
  there could 've been a similar phrase in swedish that was appropriate untranslated . 
  i mean , ( s ) he does say ` in typical american fasion [ sic ] ' . 
  i 'm not neccesarily correct though , only / u/twatbrah knows . 
   if you ca n't speak the language in the country you are living in , and not take any effort to try to learn the language , you have absolutely no right to claim yourself as a dutch citizen . 
  what rubbish , frisians can do whatever they want . 
   i guess you also do n't want to be a citizen in that country . 
  except these people * are * already dutch citizens and * are so by invitation of the dutch * ( ` gastarbeiders ' , followed by permanent residence and dutch citizenship ) . 
  you 're implying being an official dutch citizen is only part of being a dutch citizen -- if you 're not ethnically dutch/white it would somehow be okay to revoke citizenship . 
  these people are now just as ` dutch ' as you are , you are not above them in any way , deal with it . 
  probably that the term is of american origin . 
  white flight is a term even in dutch . 
  it 's okay , we gave you apartheid . 
  nor am i suggesting they would . 
  i 'm struggling to see how you would come to that conclusion based on my post . 
  india is a separate case due to colonial history . 
  there 's still resentment and the statement on the koh-i-noor -- til the name -- was a jocular reference to that . 
  boris being manhandled is serious however . 
  to be fair , you 'd expect them to say the same if they expected britain to negotiate a far better deal too . 
  what 's a penny for the eu , america and china is a month 's wages for britain . 
  you 're merely addressing that all parties have interests , not that they are disproportionate for britain . 
  the former is a strawman . 
  yes , but not as much as it is in britain 's interest . 
  no matter how strong you consider the pull for trading nations to negotiate properly with the foreign office , you must understand britain itself will feel the pull tenfold . 
  imagine new delhi demanding `` its '' priced jewel back as precondition for even sitting down at the negotiation table . 
  modi would manhandle boris . 
  they lost to the dutch in a friendly and by uefalona statues losing to an uefalona member that failed to qualify costs you your ticket . 
  based on the draw denmark will go in england 's place in an effort to reprise glorious 1992 . 
  note that this wo n't affect england 's team in the drunken homeless euros 2016 , which is good news for team captain [ gazza ( pictured hearing the news ) ] ( http://cdn.tvm.com.mt/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cascogoine-2.jpg ) . 
  thanks , the pdf worked for me though . 
  it seems that the dutch authorities were * not * informed . 
  [ this is how ankara announced they were extraditing el-bakraoui ] ( http://content1d.omroep.nl/urishieldv2/l27m489a756909370e180056f42f01000000.b6d45b286fd422bce78c1b634cff70a7/nos/docs/240316_brief_turkije.pdf ) , delivered not even a half hour before he was out on a flight to amsterdam . 
  the dutch appeared to have not been informed on the nature of his extradition . 
  because the subject was n't known to dutch authorities , had no international warrants and was a legitimate belgian citizen he was released . 
  [ turkey deviated from the procedures where the netherlands is usually informed at its ankara police liaison whenever a attention-requiring subject is extraditied ] ( http://nos.nl/video/2095022-we-weten-niet-waarom-onze-politie-in-ankara-niet-is-geinformeerd-over-de-uitzetting.html ) . 
  [ source in dutch ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2095009-kabinet-bevestigt-aanslagpleger-zaventem-was-in-nederland.html ) . 
  it all very much sounds like ankara is trying to clear its name of incompetence . 
   more general surveillance of citizens means less crime so more surveillance must be good , and still more surveillance must be even better . 
  do these people not understand what the ultimate corollary and consequence of this argument is , `` zero crime by total surveillance '' ? 
  the person who does n't understand is you . 
  if i take a small piss now i 'll lose some weight . 
  if i sit down and try to really empty my bladder , i wo n't suddenly end up weightless . 
  just because something decreases as a value goes to zero does n't mean it 'll end up at zero . 
  as a more abstract example , consider y = 1 + x , for x \u2264 0 . 
  as x goes to zero , y goes to one , not zero . 
   but have you seen the hoops a german politician has to jump through to see anything ? 
  that is because negotiations are ongoing . 
  unless the politician is directly involved in the negotiations , his or her role does n't really fully come into play when it gets to a vote . 
  they could read a bit and try to steer the government , but unlike normal laws most of the trade deal is done by bureaucrats , not representatives , their staff , their party etc. 
   i for one have no reason to trust it , not to mention that i am against a free trade agreement to begin with , i dont trust in free trade with a country that has very different regulations on food . 
  that 's a much better criticism , but of course part of the deal would be law harmonisation . 
  the result can vary a lot depending on the priority of the issue to various partners . 
  jeez , that 's one way to retreat from an argument . 
  such bitter grace . 
  it 's hilarious that he 'd use the word republic . 
  in american politics the founding fathers specifically defined the term to oppose monarchy , and where power is only given directly to , or indirectly through , the people . 
  hence this specifically opposes the church of england , the house of lords and the windsor lizard people . 
  seriously ? 
  a meromorphic function is a holomorphic ( = well behaved ) function except for a few points , where the function is ` infinite ' , called ` poles ' ( i.e. 
  1/s is a holomorphic function without s = 0 , and meromorphic if pole s = 0 is included ) . 
  i probably should n't have shitposted obscure trash but my tiredness interferes with proper self censorship . 
  my apologies . 
  we need to remove the british pole . 
  make the eu holomorphic again . 
  turkey is n't joining . 
  the big proponent of ankara in brussels is cameron anyway . 
  thanks for the article and effort . 
  i do n't understand this . 
  migration in general , and calais in particular , is a huge part of the brexit debate . 
  paris ' opinion is extremely relevant on the matter and citizens should be allowed to be informed . 
  not answering this question would be suppressing relevant information . 
  they 're not really threats . 
  when britain exits , parties will negotiate with self-interest in mind . 
  the french minister can pretend there will be no consequence whatsoever and london can negotiate a deal with only positives for britain , but that 'd be lying . 
  all that is being said `` there will be negative consequences for * both * parties '' . 
   mr macron said the eu as a whole would be weakened as a military , diplomatic and economic powerhouse if the uk left .
