  incredibly embarrassing . 
  subreddit / r/murica even celebrated it . 
  yes , but i 'm discussing the claimed difference between muslims/middle east immigrants and other immigrants , particularly those sub saharan , surinam , dutch antilles and aruban immigrants . 
  i do this by contrasting with numbers from european countries that are culturally extremely close and with the culturally very distinct countries from asia . 
  hence i 'm questioning the reasoning that the hatred of muslims and/or moroccans is a consequence of crime statistics , rather than something else . 
  i 've never heard wilders yell for less black people , or how their way of life is incompatible with dutch society . 
  a lot of people here claim all muslim autochtonen ( non-dutch natives ) are overrepresented in crime statistics . 
  but i have an interesting stat for you : practically the same % of people of german background and indonesian background have been suspects ( .9 % versus 1.1 % ) , both which are lower than our southerly neighbours from belgium ( 1.2 % ) , and great britain ( 1.4 % ) . 
  for the dutch it 's .9 % , so barely distinguishable , and certainly not far from europeans people often state integrate easier . 
  in general asians are similar to europeans in crime statistics . 
  also it 's not a muslim thing , people from dutch antilles/aruba are highests , plus sub-saharan countries are similar to middle-east countries . 
  so what gives ? 
  assad 's army is responsible for a large part of the destruction , more so than isis or aq/al-nusra . 
  maybe the kremlin could urge their dear ally to stop mass bombing civilians . 
  [ reference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_syrian_civil_war_barrel_bomb_attacks ) . 
   unlike the west we know that ` integrating ' completely foreign cultures is impossible , even if you spend 600 years doing so . 
  what bullshit , there are tons of well-integrated throughout europe . 
  in my countries surinamese and indonesians faced similar problems , and few complain about them now ( beyond outright racists ) . 
  they 're definitely not statistically indistinguishable , but as a whole they 're pretty well integrated . 
  besides , a lot of people that are now part of the same country were very distinct centuries ago , think of italy with all its warring city states . 
  i 'd rather be there at night than tons of eastern-european countries . 
  i 've been there many times after sundown , for the record . 
  as the article says , that 's only for the boats . 
  for refugees in total :  about a quarter of those seeking refuge in europe this year are children . 
  i 'm not saying you are mad , but people in this thread going  by allah , that 's exactly what 's going on !, 
  a leftist media conspiracy intent on destroying european culture . 
  rather than ,  oh my god i 'm agreeing with a video spouting a mass media conspiracy sourcing info wars . 
  wait do n't tell me ... 
  [ nooo !, 
  ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/im_retarded_quantum_leap.gif ) i do n't particularly care if it turns off the former , claims of peak carotene are unsubstantiated and therefore ignored . 
  if you do n't agree with the former , none of my comments slight you in any way . 
   i think noone will treat you seriously if you will act like that . 
  you may be right about the issue , but you ca n't argue there is a huge room for discussion . 
  yes , because we are talking here about an infowars propaganda video , people are claiming some secret media conspiracy out to destroy western civilisation . 
  that is why people in this thread are not being taken seriously . 
  if you go down that rabbit hole , do n't get mad when people shout in  oi , you 're not a fucking rabbit , what the fuck are you doing ? 
  you ca n't remove anti-immigration shitposting because they 'll throw a fit about being oppressed . 
  it 's understandable though , try putting yourself in the shoes of someone who vehemently agrees with this video . 
  they believe there is this secret war against them , that the devilish media is plotting to wipe out european culture . 
   how is this anti-migrant in a spirit ? 
  it shows they are living in bad conditions , if anything it helps to raise more money . 
  why the hell would the picture need to be anti-migrant in spirit ? 
  what sort of litmus test is that ? 
   it shows they are living in bad conditions , if anything it helps to raise more money . 
  [ ... ] i never said they show pictures of children or women only it was in part a response to the op , where the quote came from . 
   but the picture you posted is taken from a few meters away , you barely see how many men are there . 
  and women and children , which we are supposed to see less of according to the op . 
  also by your early statement , showing * more * people living in bad conditions is ill-advised . 
   it 's also weird you decided to ignore the picture below the one you posted . 
  most focus for an article is going to be on the picture on the main page ( men only ) , and the article header ( men only ) . 
  most wo n't reach the later pictures . 
  that the more striking picture you posted is not selected instead highlights the opposite of the op 's claims . 
  apparently they went out of their way to handpick men-only picture ( well , in the narrative that there is some media conspiracy , in any case ) , while your picture is much more representative , as they do not feature solely men . 
   but do n't you think they should also include the anti-migrant ones ? 
  they did . 
  the article :  rallies against welcoming more refugees and migrants took place in some eastern european countries . 
  about 5,000 people chanting anti-islamic slogans marched in the polish capital warsaw , while a nearby counter-demonstration drew about 1,000 people . 
  in prague , about 800 protesters carried banners reading `` i do not want refugees and islam in czech republic '' and `` protect the borders '' . 
  elsewhere in the city , a smaller counter-demonstration in support of refugees attracted about 200 people , witnesses said . 
  another anti-migrant rally attended by about 1,500 people took place in the slovak capital bratislava . 
  ***  in eastern europe all of these were bigger than the pro ones . 
  but they were smaller than the pro-refugee demonstrations . 
  so less coverage . 
  also , as a british news item , they were obviously centering the item around the * british * pro-immigration demonstration . 
  notice article excludes the pro-immigration demonstration in spain , austria and portugal , despite being larger than the 800 people protesters in prague . 
  seems a little anti-refugee biased . 
   i just do n't like propaganda and this is an example straight out of the books . 
  i agree , i do n't understand how people are upvoting this video . 
  i mean , they 're literally adding music to hand selected videos to create a narrative . 
  if you put your ear to the ground , you can hear riefenstahl 's applause . 
  western civilisation stems from muslim scholars preserving the pre-christian wisdom from the christian extremists opposed to anything that questioned their religion . 
  the islamic efforts were later re-imported only when europe * ended * its absurd obsession with christianity , to replace it with pre-christian classical philosophy . 
  western civilisation stems from the marginalisation of christianity . 
  the rally was much smaller compared to the pro-refugees demonstrations , as shown . 
  if anything it 's odd reuters opens with the polish confluence , rather than the larger british or danish ones . 
  it contains carefully picked footage together with carefully selected with background music . 
  it 's not one sided , it 's propaganda 101 . 
  euronews , tmc ( [ big channel in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_television_stations_in_france ) ) . 
  nope . 
   bbc.co.uk frontpage , centrespread [ features this picture ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/410/cpsprodpb/14303/production/_85519628_85519627.jpg ) . 
  main picture of article itself [ is men sleeping on a train station ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/f4e3/production/_85519626_85519625.jpg ) . 
   yet all of the pictures are of children and women . 
  could n't get passed the first hurdle , shame . 
   one of the main stories are a pro-refugee rallies across europe should they stop covering those rallies ? 
   they were basically non-existent compared to the anti-immigration ones , you really need to have an agenda to ignore that . 
  the anti-migrant rallies were much smaller but are mentioned . 
  earlier anti-immigration rallies have received wide coverage . 
  you * really * need to have an agenda to ignore that . 
  they 're already here . 
  i mean , we 're discussing a video that 's sourcing infowars on false media narrative . 
  hey , i personally sympathise much more with trains than war refugees , give me a break . 
  \\  \\  migrant crisis : the footage the media refuses to broadcast \\  almost exclusively made of media footage . 
  \\  infowars.kek i also basically have seen all of this footage . 
  ^ ^ ^ \\* edit : ^ ^ ^ beside ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ infowars ^ ^ ^ one , ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ swear . 
  not those that i 've met , though quite a few have a dual nationality in their mind . 
  got a source or is it just an anecdote ? 
  i do n't think so , but that does n't mean those involved should be allowed to completely exempt themselves from the consequences . 
  of the three biggest cheerleaders ( usa , uk , france ) , only the latter bears the cost . 
  meanwhile those that were reluctant or uninvolved completely are very negatively affected . 
  a ' solution ' to a problem should include the outfall of the ' solution ' too .
