  iraq / isis is a great example of an half-assed cure being worse than the disease . 
  note that a lot of libya problems is more related to the resulting power vacuum in the east with which no western nation has contact , preventing the kind of cooperation they have with other north african countries that prevents the boat problem . 
  the number of libyan refugees is , as far as i know , not especially high . 
  huh , did n't know that about the jewish diaspora . 
  any reason why they were different ? 
  why 5 % ? 
  why not 37.9 % or . 
  this is just lowbrow fear mongering based on pulling a random , baseless stat out your ass . 
  there are 1.1 billion africans , where are your fabled 55 million asylum seekers ? 
  also in your ass ? 
  you realise they have a right to asylum there , right ? 
  lol , there was a lot of shit about eastern europeans some time ago . 
  our most famous demagogue wilders was on about it for a while before moving back to muslims , then solely moroccans . 
  i 'm sure he 's back to hating all muslims now . 
  it has become increasingly difficult to speak ill of poles in the last decade as it has become clear they strongly contribute to dutch society while drawing very little resources from it . 
  it should be noted that the eyes closing is n't exactly unjustified given how it force all migrants on them . 
  only since 2006 . 
  you realise it 's pretty ill-advised to publicly announce on the internet you 're married to a person all dutch can uniquely identify , right ? 
  i assume this is a reference to the jews ' ` treatment ' , which was death , a forceful conversion to catholicism or relocation to other places , like the venetian ghetto ? 
  the jews that lived there before the reconquista might disagree . 
  this contrasts nicely with the french walking up to our frozen fleet as seen in the most embarrassing thread . 
  not to me , relax a little . 
  the french , brits and americans secretly decided to cancel air support , without ever informing the dutch government or troops on the ground . 
  the latter continued requesting air supported and were even promised just before the bosnian serbs took over positions resulting to the capture of dutch defence posts and its soldiers . 
  the documents this is based on , released by president clinton as part of a wide range of intelligence papers , even show the americans were aware of the ` humanitarian ' risk should enclaves be captured , even highlighting srebrenica . 
  there 's also a strong implication in the body of documents that the nato three were looking for a casus belli , which srebrenica turned out to be . 
  a few months ago there was a documentary about this , large parts are in english so you might be able to watch it . 
  i 'm on mobile now so sourcing is a bit of a pain , i 'll be on a computer in half an hour . 
   documents of the american secret service show the french and britons had ` sold ' srebrenica to rescue 340 british and french hostages held by the bosnian serbs . 
  http://www.elsevier.nl/nederland/achtergrond/2015/6/dit-is-waarom-dutchbatters-geen-luchtsteun-kregen-bij-srebrenica-1784240w/ \\* edit 1 : [ this ] ( http://www.human.nl/2doc/waarom-srebrenica-moest-vallen.html ) is the documentary , i do n't know whether you are legally allowed to view it . 
  it 's also important to note that after the documentary , the dutch government has requested the release of all related documents by the white house . 
  even those made public by the [ bill clinton library ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/clinton-white-house-library-records-103959.html ) feature many redactions that could outline how well informed the intellgence services were on the consequences of their actions and the risks posed in their secret implicit ceding of srebrenica . 
  [ as written in a document seen and signed by president clinton ) [ http://srebrenica.vpro.nl/.imaging/stk/specials/image-100/media/srebrenica/secret-history-of-dayton-p.-5-quote_edit/original/secret%20history%20of%20dayton%20p.%205%20quote_edit.png]:  [ ... ] officials decided to suspend `` quietly '' the use of airstrikes against the serbs for the foreseeable future , as un peacekeepers were just too vulnerable to serb retaliation . 
  this was a position supported by [ france 's president ] chirac as well as [ british prime minister ] major ( as both expressed to the president the day before ) . 
  ( note : in the footnote one american diplomat vehemently disagrees : http://srebrenica.vpro.nl/.imaging/stk/specials/image-100/media/srebrenica/secret-history-of-dayton-voetnoot/original/secret-history-of-dayton-voetnoot.png ) \\* edit 2 : the smoking gun [ on american prescience ] ( http://files.vpro.nl/scenario-editor/projects/srebrenica/project-assets/pdf/lr5-id8_discussiestuk.pdf ) ( p. 3 , highlighted ) :  `` avoid debacle of u.s. / nato-led withdrawal being depicted as precursor to brutal ethnic cleansing '' note that this directly contradicts the american/un/nato mindset that the ethnic cleansing was unexpected and that if prior knowledge was available it could 've been prevented . 
  as an advisor states to clinton , with his approval indicated on [ the document itself ] ( http://files.vpro.nl/scenario-editor/projects/srebrenica/project-assets/pdf/lr5-id9_memorandum.pdf ) ( p. 3 , highlighted , approval at the end , `` i agree as you have set forth '' ) :  we would prefer not to see a withdrawal from the eastern enclaves , with the associated potential for a * humanitarian nightmare * for the civilians in the safe areas currently under the promise of un protection . 
  my entire reading based on a partial reading of the documents and viewing of the documentary ( at the time ) , is that the americans ( and french , british ) willingly yielded unprofor troops , including the dutch troops , and the enclaves without informing them , with foreknowledge of the possible consequence -- at least in washington . 
  as a result , dutch troops were captured and the abandoned dutchmen in turn abandoned the enclave they were supposed to protect , with no indication of prescience on their part of the humanitarian catastrophe that would unfold . 
  the notion of prescience is extremely important because the west has washed its hands of the issue by claiming it was completely unexpected . 
  clearly this was not the case . 
   the french really screwed over the dutch soldiers by refusing air support . 
  plus the british and americans . 
  that 's part of the global interest in the syrian interest , through assad moscow has control over a potential iraq iran pipeline to europe . 
  they also rebuffed an qatar pipeline for russia . 
  thanks for the link . 
  oh that 's simple . 
  we 're basically a monopsy . 
  if the eu decides it together , russia ca n't refuse . 
  factor in the current economy and world petroleum prices , and moscow will fold before the ink has dried . 
  i 've always been in favour of one of the ukraine sanctions including this particular measure , especially given the kremlin 's use of it as a geopolitical tool or threat . 
  hell , i 'm not above mandating sub market price and including kiev in the deal , twisting the knife for good measure . 
  ( if your intentions are truly evil , include ankara , belgrade , etc. 
  in your pact ! ), 
  we should be careful not to also apply the abuse to other petroleum markets though , being a bad actor should only warrant such severe measures . 
  and we should n't increase our exposure to russian energy either , so it should be capped off at current import . 
  it would greatly help the economy of eastern european countries too , finland and greece included . 
  bbc nature . 
  ( and rightly so . ), 
  are they geolocated ? 
  just pictures does n't mean much . 
  source is facebook , ukraine today is just usa today 's section on ukraine . 
  what a terrible article . 
  by outsourcing the opinion to readers , they make no effort to correct their extremely flimsy basis either by improving the arguments or exposing the rubbish that it is . 
  instead they are presented as implying some sort of substance ( again , not found in the article itself because of the shit reading despite the desperate `` we 're not racists , guys '' ) , and then the author finally does contribute with some desperate attempt to pin it all on the current irish governement . 
  drivel . 
  i agree on pretty much everything except the last paragraph . 
  no idea where that suddenly came from . 
  i 'm sure there 's some level of communication between moscow and the ( european ) ultra left / communists , though probably not to the extent of the soviet days . 
  nonetheless i do n't think syriza really acted as kremlin representative , they only had some grandstanding for a russian rescue that was never on the cards . 
  generally their behaviour is significantly more consistent with the notion of left wing populism that had no real game plan other than shouting a lot , and then ultimately cornered itself . 
  they do n't have a point , their article is baseless conjecture built on top of vacuous statements . 
  this article is a perfect example of ' conspiracy prose ' like you 'd find on global research.ca , info wars , truther movies , etc. 
  it makes totally unsubstantiated claims after unexplained leaps of logic with some random , disconnected factoids thrown in . 
  the only difference is the 2edgy4me packaging . 
  look at a thesis of the article : timmermans purposefully flunked the report to get his big eu job . 
  it is never said why one would lead to the other . 
  it is never substantiated that he flunked the report . 
  it is never explained why the rest of the government would allow that , how the other members of government would benefit . 
  it 's just stated as something established . 
  this article , and the background article ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2015/07/geen_onderste_steen.html ) do , however , spend a lot of time calling timmermans names . 
  that 's more important . 
  ( remember , i was never employed as a source in this discussion . 
  and of course , i do substantiate my claims . ), 
  ca n't believe the level of discourse has dropped to the point that someone considered geenstijl as source . 
  for non dutch people , imagine that someone developed an unbelievably complex a.i. 
  capable of recognising the cancer of / b / . 
  then that person used this to funnel only the * cancer * to a site to let it eat into itself for a few years . 
  the resulting stew is geenstijl . 
  just as an indication of what the site / brand stands for , they host a site called dumpert , where they rehost youtube videos with massive , atrocious watermarks . 
  ebaumsworld still lives on . 
  ah man , there are a lot of great russian physicists and mathematicians in the netherlands . 
  i hope that the non spies are n't affected by this . 
  i generally do n't see a lot of use for them , but i guess the fsb . 
  http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4808:nije0v.2.2 not netflix, 
  i 'm pretty sure netflix does n't actually * own * those shows , they just bid on the production of it for certain geographical areas , just like other companies bid on the same show for distribution in other countries . 
  thank god for honest hellenic practices in accounting then . 
  i remember people of elstat ( greek statistics bureau ) complaining that greece would 've been in a better place if only their numbers had been different , which they attributed to the current director of elstat which was not a political appointee or something like that . 
  they also opposed the increasing independence from politics on top of their director , so they were striking . 
  it 's hard to argue any amount of force will ever end corruption in an origination that employs such people and harbours those feelings . 
  portugal is a net receiver from the bailouts .
