  it would be funny if a tulip mania happened because the dutch were angered into buying their own flowers by patriotism . 
  finland has ultimately agreed to help other countries without receiving a bailout themselves , in pretty subpar times for the country too . 
  surely finland would now be * more * deserving of help , especially from those that were helped ( ireland , spain , cyprus , portugal , greece ) ? 
  it would be disgusting if any of those five countries would refuse finland if the roles were reversed , only taking but not giving . 
  participation rate is an important measure for comparing countries , looking at one separately is misleading . 
  coincidentally it does n't seem to be worse than the us [ in this case ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.tlf.cact.zs?order=wbapi_data_value_2013+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=asc ) . 
  99.99999 % chance this is a response to the mh17 un tribunal and/or investigation . 
  absolutely disgusting . 
  you are comparing bonds with different maturities with different non-payment implications ( imf ) ... 
  it 's like comparing apples with weaponised oranges . 
  you 're saying germany is benefiting from converting its own low-risk bonds to super high risk greek bonds and netting the interest difference ? 
  you realise the market price for greek bonds are what they are for a reason , right ? 
  and that you should in economics always think in opportunity cost , which in this case is massive for berlin . 
  because greek banks hold a ton of domestic bonds and use it as collateral for ecb loans ( ela ) . 
  athens ca n't cut debt without having to refinance the banks , which they ca n't afford . 
  think of it like this : japan is famous for having over two times gdp debt . 
  so why not default ? 
  because japanese * own * two times the gdp in government loans . 
   the crazy thing about this was that the eurozone countries with the banks with the most greek debt ( germany and france ) ended up with less debt than they would have had if they had simply bailed out their banks . 
  do you have a source for this ? 
  because i 'm 99 % certain the greek domestic market held the most debt . 
  this is what you 'd generally expect for any country but coincidentally i tried to find how high the exposure of greece itself was to public debt in 2009 . 
  the few found sources were questionably sourced themselves , but the domestic market approached 50 % . 
  also the eurozone countries continued to rack up greek debt post-bailout , which amounted to quite a lot thanks to the massive athens deficit . 
  it should be noted quite a lot of planes flew over east-ukraine . 
  there was a narrative created shortly after the disaster that malaysian airlines was one of the few if not the only company flying there . 
  this was fuelled by companies declaring they had consistently avoided the region , but actual flight data showed a lot of these companies were full of it . 
  it 's pretty disgusting for these companies to provide false insurances . 
  an earlier comment : * * * before the mh17 disaster , an average of 36 commercial planes a day flew over east-ukraine . 
  including : ( russian ) aeroflot , austrian airlines , etihad airlines , qatar airways and singapore airlines . 
  [ source in dutch ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2028733-juist-meer-vluchten-boven-oost-oekraine-voor-mh17-ramp.html ) , [ data ] ( http://app.nos.nl/datavisualisatie/vluchten-over-oost-oekraine/ ) ( in dutch , but you discern the data anyway ) . 
  the cause was mostly the closing of the airspace above crimea , after that many flights chose e-ukraine . 
  the problem is less the hubris of taxing people abroad , but that they were never properly informed of the changes . 
  as a result they never filed their taxes . 
  it 's a government 's duty to inform their citizens . 
  failure to do so should preclude any claims based on the changes . 
  in the netherlands at least it 's a legal requirement . 
  there are people who are american , but have never lived there . 
  they were not informed , warned , etc. , and suddenly find out about big financial claims of washington , forcing the closure of banking accounts , mortgages , etc. 
  the irs is wrecking their life for something that could be avoided . 
  let them drop their american identity , which is a massive pain in the ass currently even without this attempted theft . 
  sounds like a slippery slope that ends in bulgaria . 
  yeah , it seems unlikely . 
  it 's just that if they want to do more they have to create space themselves to do more . 
   2014 is after 5 years of being under the austerity yoke . 
  that 's no longer the responsability of greece , but of the trojka . 
  you realise one of the major complaint of the greeks is the austerity ? 
  the decreased government spending . 
  i 'm saying without the troika , it would 've been worse . 
  the accusation of ` austerity ' towards the troika rings hollow because * without it * , it was worse . 
   2009 was also after the banking crisis ' start and the lack of emergency support of the eurozone , so again , not a greek responsibility . 
  i do n't understand what you 're saying . 
   greece should have defaulted back in 2009 greece had a massive deficit . 
  government spending in 2014 was 50 % higher than it would 've been with a balanced budget in 2009/10 ( according to my rough calculations you can find in my history ) . 
  also , you forget who the greeks owed money . 
  greek people and greek banks , both approximately a quarter each . 
  with no money to bail the latter out ( since athens had to * half * government spending instantly ) , after the first greek bank would 've gone down , the rest of the domestic financial dominoes would 've fallen like a [ house of cards ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfu69_up02y ) . 
  of course , this would 've completely shattered the greek economy with all the money gone , in addition to the massive reduction in government spending . 
  congratulations , everyone is bankrupt . 
  varoufakis seems so keen on stating the bailout for the banks , but he conveniently leaves out which banks needed it the most . 
  also , as the above will tell you , greece itself needed saving to , both its banks and its government . 
  if the other eurozone countries acted out of self-interested they never would 've touched domestic greek debt and covered athens deficit . 
   not that i am against going to the left , modern european neo-liberalism and austarity obviously is n't working . 
  greece is n't getting anything soon save for a grexit or an economic miracle . 
  if they reform enough outside the deals , they might get more room for different policies . 
  dijsselbloem did when varoufakis alleged there were secret negotiations ongoing that would be presented on monday immediately after an ochi/no vote . 
  in pretty much the same breath he alleged the banks would be open by tuesday . 
  ( [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d3xwt/yanis_varoufakis_full_transcript_our_battle_to/ct1lhbh ) . ), 
  assuming your flair implies dutch comprehension , the phrasing was was that his claims were `` uit zijn duim gezogen '' , an idiom for `` made up '' . 
   kept telling it like it is and walked out with his diginity and his integrity intact well ... [ channel 4 ] ( https://www.facebook.com/channel4news/videos/vb.6622931938/10153050793226939/?type=2&amp;theater ) :  varoufakis : let me tell you something which is probably unknown . 
  ever since we declared a referendum and incensed our european partners we had the most , er , interesting proposals coming from brussels . 
  perhaps this referendum and the impasse that it represents concentrated several minds in brussels and we 've had some really good proposals . 
  proposals that we would sign on the dotted line for . 
   paul mason : you have a proposal you would sign on the dotted line for ? 
   varoufakis : yes we do . 
   paul mason : where is it ? 
   varoufakis : i 'm not going to tell you . 
  it 's somewhere in this building . 
  but the of course crucial part of the story is that before this proposal becomes a genuine negotiating document which we can sign off on monday , the greek people have to empower us with a `` no . '', 
  * * * [ ap ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/the-latest-moodys-downgrades-greece-to-caa3/2015/07/01/477bf7fc-2050-11e5-a135-935065bc30d0_story.html ) :  here 's the question all greeks want to know : when will the banks reopen ? 
   greek finance minister yanis varoufakis had an answer for that and other key questions posed to him thursday by reporters ahead of sunday 's referendum on whether greece should accept creditors ' demands for more austerity in exchange for more loans . 
   will the banks reopen ? 
  varoufakis said : `` of course they 'll open !, 
  of course ! ''  when will that be ? 
  he replied : `` on tuesday . ''  will the banks reopen with or without a deal between greece and its creditors ? 
  varoufakis said : `` with a deal , which is a certainty . '' * * * [ bloomberg ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-02/defiant-varoufakis-says-he-ll-quit-if-greeks-endorse-austerity ) :  varoufakis today insisted that greece 's banks will be able to open without difficulty on tuesday , after the planned closure is completed . 
  he blamed creditors for shutting them down and accused them of making up rules as they go along . 
   `` there was a political decision by europe to shut the banks down as a way of effectively pushing us to accept a non-viable agreement , '' varoufakis said . 
  `` once the political crisis is over , after the greek people deliver their verdict , banks will open . '' we 've learned today that a grexit was definitely on the table ( leaked deal earlier in the night ) . 
  i think the opposite is true . 
  varoufakis made promises to the electorate he never could have kept ( and never should have made ) , so he ran before he had to own up . 
  at the end of the day varoufakis barely made an impact beyond vacuous pr , being sidelined for negotiations since [ april ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/27/us-eurozone-greece-varoufakis-iduskbn0ni0vi20150427 ) . 
  seems like the deal is finalising . 
  germany [ has backed de guindos since summer last year ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-priorities-2020/merkel-backs-spains-de-guindos-lead-eurogroup-307951 ) , at the time the result seemed a guaranteed success for madrid . 
  they 've complained ( i have no idea if it 's justified ) that their country has too few top eu jobs . 
  they were the only ones that voted against dijsselbloem last time ( for those reasons ) . 
  since luis de guindos apparently been a proactive reformer in the midst of south european governments accused of being only reactive , he has a lot of useful qualities to break the perception of a north south divide and contrast -- jeroen obviously does n't . 
  however it seems almost inevitable the current drama will influence whatever happens .
