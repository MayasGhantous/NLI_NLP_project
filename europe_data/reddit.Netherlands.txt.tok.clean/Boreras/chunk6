  this cartoon is fine like the others . 
   the programme has a strong focus on social welfare and reducing unemployment . 
  besides , the one-off `` social dividend '' planned for 2014 , efforts have been made to widen the scope of unemployment benefits to the long-term unemployed and to widen access of the uninsured to health services through health passports . 
  in addition , a * minimum income guarantee scheme * is being launched on a pilot basis in two municipalities . 
  it is intended that this scheme will be rolled-out across the country in phased manner , starting in 2015 . 
  it will be a key component of the country 's new strategy for social welfare , which will be based on a comprehensive review , consolidation and better targeting of all existing benefits to ensure a fiscally sustainable , more efficient and effective allocation reaching those most in need . 
   a guaranteed minimum income scheme is being created . 
  it will start on a pilot basis in two areas of the country and a phased-in national roll-out should start in the course of 2015 , depending on the availability of financing . 
  this sequential approach is justified by the need to develop and test the scheme on its various dimensions , ranging from eligibility criteria and selection beneficiaries , to determination of benefits and the activation of the beneficiaries , to setting the administrative infrastructure , including an effective monitoring and controlling mechanism . 
  an integration of the guaranteed minimum income scheme with other social benefits and services is envisaged . 
  before advancing to the national roll-out , the pilot experiences will be evaluated by march 2015 , to fine-tune the design of the scheme . 
  the world bank is assisting the greek authorities in the implementation of the pilots .

  hmm . 
  oddly enough the same source ( maurice de hond peiling ) the same poll a week prior gave grexit majority , as your article states . 
   the majority of the dutch population is against a grexit . 
  nope , 54 % in favour , 30 % against greece leaving euro according to [ a ` rtl nieuws ' poll ] ( http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/sites/default/files/content/documents/2015/07/06/griekenlanduitdeeuro.pdf ) . 
   the ecb legally ca n't loan to greek banks without collateral , which are either loans to the banks guaranteed by the greek government or greek bonds . 
  however athens could n't guarantee loans anymore on account of not paying its own debt , the greek bonds . 
  thus the bonds themselves are obviously now useless too because greece defaulted on loans . 
  there was n't an inch for the ecb to maneuver without breaking the law and consequently destroying the value of , and confidence in , the rules the ecb is bound by . 
   i see you read the ecb 's press release hmm ? 
  actually , the situation is more complex and if there was a political will to work around the issue of collateral , it would have been found . 
  there literally was no time to devise new rules because when athens announced it everyone was caught off guard . 
  also you do n't * will * around the collateral requirements for the reasons i stated above . 
  rules and compliance are necessary for a central bank to operate well . 
   the reality is just simpler : the ecb would prefer to use this tactic of threatening a total banking crisis to get the greek government to back down . 
  in other words , the ecb is choosing sides in this crisis and acting in a partisan way . 
  i think loaning the greek banks money when they are already basically insolvent , living purely on ela , would be choosing sides . 
  breaking the rules like you suggested , it 's picking sides . 
  doing as you are bound by law to do is neutral . 
   why do we even pretend this is a ` european ' central bank in that case if it is very clear that it will act in the interest of certain european governments at the expense of others ? 
  it is absolutely not in the interest of the eighteen other eurozone states to provide more loans to a nation in default . 
  you are approaching this the wrong way in asking it to act in the benefit of one member at the expense of all others , with acts that would be illegal to boot . 
   the correct response from the ecb would have been to ensure the continued operation of the greek banking sector * no matter what * the disagreement between greece and the creditors would be . 
  absolutely not my opinion . 
  if greece decides to default , as they see facto did by not securing the third troika package but rather halting negotiations until after default , they are free to do so , but at their own expense . 
  unilateral actions beget unilateral consequences . 
   you do n't think it would have been better for * all parties * to negotiate a better programme that actually , you know , works ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  syriza explicitly campaigned on non compliance with the troika . 
  i do n't have faith in the greeks ' ability to implement and maintain the necessary changes on both the government 's side , especially with syriza , and the greek people , who have campaigned.to tax dodge any changes from the troika under the we wo n't pay movement ( coincidentally with full syriza support ) . 
  outside the euro however they are their own master and can no longer outsource the blame to the terrorist troika . 
  greece has tried to troika programme for five years . 
  the programme was not implemented like athens promised it would . 
  the troika now is sceptical about new programmes and wonders of the necessity of a new program maybe due to the greek government itself . 
  how is this unreasonable ? 
  it is * really obvious * that the greek implementation has failed , especially with the explicit promises of syriza to undo part of the reforms and stop austerity , while also joining an active campaign to not pay your taxes ( `` we wo n't pay '' ) and simultaneously promising to voters not to pay back the debt to the people they 're currently trying to get a loan from . 
  why the fuck is the troika even negotiating with people that call them terrorists ? 
  the fact that people like you think this entire situation should be about bluffing and fighting with each other and whatever other rubbish you wrote just shows you do n't understand the basic point : the greeks are unwilling and/or unable to implement what they promise . 
  everyone involved should admit that and try to come up with a better programme . 
  have you seen varoufakis or any of these demagogues own up to their bullshit ? 
  are the banks open yet ? 
  no fucking chance . 
  instead they would rather pretend the everything is entirely the troika 's fault because they are evil scheming terrorists determined to humiliate the greeks or whatever . 
  ( i 'll be away from home for a few hours , responses will be late . 
  i 'll preempt a point that 's likely to come up : greek debt * is * actually payable . 
  the interest payments due are ' just ' high , not exceptionally high . 
  in 2014 with 4 % gdp it was smaller than other bailed out eurozone countries , and only 0.4 % gdp below the americans ' 3.6 % . 
  having said that the post is a little bit in jest . ), 
   greece thought they had an economical bomb as a threat but in reality all they ever had was a firecracker . 
  athens did set off an economical bomb , but they had n't bothered to developed proper ballistics . 
  thus the threat was called and the damage self inflicted . 
   the ecb basically acted like mobsters and decided to put the entire greek banking system ( of which all the banks are * solvent * ) at risk of insolvency by refusing to extend reserves to cover cash withdrawals . 
  the ecb legally ca n't loan to greek banks without collateral , which are either loans to the banks guaranteed by the greek government or greek bonds . 
  however athens could n't guarantee loans anymore on account of not paying its own debt , the greek bonds . 
  thus the bonds themselves are obviously now useless too because greece defaulted on loans . 
  there was n't an inch for the ecb to maneuver without breaking the law and consequently destroying the value of , and confidence in , the rules the ecb is bound by . 
  athens itself is at fault for not appreciating this risk . 
   so what could he really do ? 
  referendum before going bankrupt . 
   this has been a disgusting period of politics from the troika and i am ashamed to be european at this point . 
  coincidentally i have the same feelings , only for syriza , not the `` terrorists '' . 
   we basically just witnessed the troika use mafia tactics to get this man ( who i believe is sincerely trying to get a better deal for the people of his country ) to back down . 
  dispicable . 
  i do n't think you understand what mafia tactics constitute . 
  for one , they 're not very partial to loans with * sub * market yields . 
  more appropriate would be threats towards varoufakis environment , but of course yanis has done that already by his own volition . 
   the worst part is that people like schaeuble probably think of themselves as righteous , moral crusaders of economic truth and the similarity of their behaviour to loan sharks over these past months will not even dawn on them . 
  actually loan sharks tend to push loans with incredibly high interest rates , * high * being the keyword here . 
  also note that all behaviour here occurs as greece is trying to secure a new loan , rather than the troika forcibly debt collecting . 
  the troika is the opposite then , something like a distrustful manatee . 
  it goes against everything they campaigned on ( ` we wo n't pay ' , no more austerity , etc ) , reiterating their points with the referendum . 
  there are plenty reasons to dissent for syriza . 
  maybe less for pasok , nd . 
  there 's no certainty it will get support from the other eurozone governments or their parliaments . 
  supporting this has very severe political implications for a lot of the ruling parties in the various countries , in most this will be a bailout against the people 's wishes . 
  many might not want to spend political and literal capital on people who have spoken and negotiated as syriza has . 
   the way he preaches hate in an atricle like this i can only imagine what negotiating with him must be like . 
  he has n't been part of negotiations for a long time , in [ april he derailed eurogroup talks in riga ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/27/us-eurozone-greece-varoufakis-iduskbn0ni0vi20150427 ) . 
  euclid tsakalotos has been the de facto negotiator and finance minister ever since . 
  varoufakis is an empty pr suit spewing rhetoric for the home crowd and appealing to syriza-sympathizers abroad like podemos . 
  [ mandatory reminder that when he came to italy for bailout numero tre , he made a heartfelt appeal ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/08/uk-eurozone-greece-varoufakis-idukkbn0lc0qk20150208 ) :  italian officials , i ca n't tell you from which big institution , approached me to tell me they backed us but they ca n't tell the truth because italy also risks bankruptcy and they are afraid of the reaction from germany . 
  let 's face it , italy 's debt situation is unsustainable . 
  during the referendum varoufakis was also the hardest in his empty demagogy and hatred towards euro partners and institutions . 
  tsipras probably planned to can him a long time ago so they might as well concentrate hatred on the person that they 'll withdraw , or bullshit the greeks on unachievable things the successor ca n't be entirely be blamed for failing ( banks still are n't open , capital control is still in place , despite yanis ' ~ ~ insurances ~ ~ transparent lies ) . 
  the world bank is unrelated to the troika , the third partner is the european commission , though it usually refers to the eurozone version thereof , and with it the eurogroup .
