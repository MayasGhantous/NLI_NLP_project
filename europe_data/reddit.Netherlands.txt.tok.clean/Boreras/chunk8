  i imagine le pen is similarly well positioned to take advantage of debt relief .

  note that this is a review from last year . 
  the most damning would be one more recent , but the policy review due september has n't been done iirc * because * of non compliance . 
  the program has broken down ever since . 
  income tax code . 
  property value assessment and taxation ( meft ( 6 ) ) . 
  revenue administration hiring and staffing policy . 
  hiring of external auditors . 
  i do n't feel like writing down more of them , but the list is pretty long . 
   additionally , keep in mind that whilst the german public and their politicians do n't want to make concessions to greece , most would rather make concessions than have greece leave . 
  i know that in the netherlands apparently the majority wants no more loans , no debt relief , * more * austerity and greece * out * of the euro .

  not if there 's debt relief . 
  the dutch cabinet will get slaughtered politically . 
  the pvda party will only decline further , while tons of vvd voters will flock to wilders . 
   that would be retarded . 
  greece wont receive any money if they do n't implement what they agree on . 
  they 're currently negotiating a deal because they did n't implement what they were supposed to . 
  expecting them to suddenly uphold a much more punitive package is fantastic doggerel . 
  \\* edit , because of the downvote , here 's everyone 's favourite imf report that suggests debt restructuring on * what causes the need for debt restructuring * :  by late summer 2014 , with interest rates having declined further , it appeared that no further debt relief would have been needed under the november 2012 framework , if the program were to have been implemented as agreed . 
  but significant changes in policies since then -- not least , lower primary surpluses and a weak reform effort that will weigh on growth and privatization -- are leading to substantial new financing needs . 
  coming on top of the very high existing debt , these new financing needs render the debt dynamics unsustainable, 
   and no debt relief discussion despite the agreements with the previous governments in 2012 . 
  the other end of the deal involved athens fulfilling their agreements . 
  if greece does n't do their part , do n't expect others to theirs either . 
  the reason debt relief is , and should not be , on the table is hellenic non-compliance . 
  it is neither legal nor possible to pass in many parlementaires . 
  why must so many other ez countries ' parties commit political seppuku just to save tsipras from the mess he created himself ? 
  syriza promised other people 's money . 
  the greeks literally do n't have a plan yet , as of 17:49 cet ( so czech time ) . 
  ( [ source in dutch ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2046077-veel-geruchten-in-athene-maar-nog-geen-concreet-plan.html ) ) \\* edit : well they appear to have a plan now . 
  everyone east of the czech republic , afaik , or of germanic origin . 
  most other ez countries are in a somewhat dubious state , with many of them having previously received a bailout . 
  even france is n't in the best situation , performing poorly post-lehman brothers and being disproportionately exposed . 
  huh , that 's really interesting . 
  thanks . 
   considering they sat on the imf report , i really do n't think it 's such a big deal . 
  greece ca n't really rely too much on a document stating debt relief is necessary because athens * itself * fumbled its obligations . 
  i 'm sure the past two weeks will have done enough damage . 
  the ez would be well advised to just quit this now before they 'll be blamed for the damage athens did to itself , and will , of course , consequently be asked to foot the bill too . 
  that does n't matter , they 'll travel over the balkan instead . 
  it 's cheaper , safer , and easier to get in . 
  people are already travelling that route too . 
  maybe they 're from former british colonies ? 
  that would mean there already is a subculture of theirs integrated into britain , but not in france . 
  the opposite is true , say , for algerians , malians . 
  it would be much safer and easier to gain entry into eu via the balkan . 
  if anything it might make the route through greece easier without eu funded border control . 
  probably different standards and definition of a robbery . 
  well as a political cartoon it tends to play to stereotypes .

  where is the quote from this '24 hour ultimatum ' ? 
  the graph is a bit misleading , y-axis is truncated . 
  previously the greek banks loaned money to themselves with a double digit interest rate . 
  i 'm not kidding . 
  this is entirely worthless , unless someone guarantees these self-loans . 
  that 's what the greek government did . 
  they said to the ecb : ` if the bank does n't fulfil its obligations , we will in its stead ' . 
  i 'd expect the haircut increase is the reflection of the guarantor greece , which ca n't pay its own dues ( imf ) , let alone others . 
  here 's varoufakis on the subject : http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2014/05/11/how-the-greek-banks-secured-an-additional-hidden-e41-billion-bailout-from-european-taxpayers/ ( the article is a bit dated , as it does n't mention he himself and tsipras continued the practice ), 
  the bank need more money to be able to trade , allow account holders to withdraw and pay the money to lenders , etc. 
  it can either get that from outside the bank ( bailout ) , or from inside the bank ( bail-in ) . 
  inside the bank means from people who have deposits in the bank ( depositors ) or people who lent the bank money ( bondholders ) . 
  in some way you can see the bank owes both groups money . 
  if it 's from account holders ( depositors ) , they literally take money from their accounts in the bank ( e.g. 
  they reduce every account by 30 % if it 's over 10k $ ) . 
  so now there is less money on the bank that 's owned by other people . 
  if on the other hand it 's a bondholders bail-in , the bonds ( loans made to the bank ) the bondholders own gets reduced in value . 
  so now the bank owes people less money . 
  with the same assets , they have a net increase in money . 
  having said that , a bail-in can also refer a mix of the bondholders bail-in and creditors bail-in . 
  it 's also used to prepare for a bailout . 
  taxpayers ` take over ' the bank with a bailout , but they are annoyed with the people who loaned the bank money while the bank did not do the right thing , causing the need of a bailout . 
  so the bondholders who lent the bank money get punished by the bondholders bail-in . 
  alternatively you can see the bail-in as a way of saying by the party that bails out the bank ( if it is done together like in cyprus ) : `` the only way there is still money on your account ( depositors ) or your loans to the bank are worth something ( bondholders ) , is by our effort to take over the bank with this bailout . 
  without us , you would have nothing , so you owe us . '', 
  tl ; dr the bank lacks money , so by a ` bail-in ' it reduces the money owed to others . 
  either from the people who have an account there or people who loaned the bank money ( bonds ) . 
  it 's basically a bank defaulting on the people the bank owes money . 
  your reply is pretty much what mine was going to be . 
  i 'd add athens would probably consider their position strengthened since their delegation now in some form represents a government of national unity , at the very least as far as this is concerned . 
  i think it 's not unreasonable that greek euro membership meant accelerated growth , but maybe not quite to the order they had previously . 
  the correction is perhaps a little worse than in should be , but that tends to happen . 
  what sabasnl said , very droll . 
  i do n't think so . 
  all newspapers , including very good ones , had it translated as terrorism . 
  also i have a downvoted response there with 7 greek english translators/dictionaries all unequivocally translating it as terrorism . 
  that 's overwhelming evidence it 's * terrorism * . 
  the argument that it 's not is just someone saying it on the internet . 
  if the markets are glad he is gone , do n't they then consider him a negative influence ? 
  clearly their distrust in him was internalised in the market . 
  \\ - a = good , implies a = bad . 
  also just because i 'm dutch does n't mean i 'm involved with mills . 
  that 's a stereotype . 
  it 's interesting what will happen , if countries will budge .
