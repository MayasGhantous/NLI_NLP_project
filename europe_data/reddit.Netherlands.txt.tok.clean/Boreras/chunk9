  the greeks already had a strong mandate in january when they were elected on the same platform . 
  this might strengthen their mandate , but it does little for others . 
  language in athens was insanely provocative and polarising . 
  the greek economy will have severely weakened this past quarter even without the devastating bank control week , while refusing previously agreed reforms . 
  this makes helping greece respectively more expensive financially and politically . 
  the june 28 deal is worse now than a week ago for the troika . 
  what can prevent a next government , greek or otherwise , to reject standing agreements , to demand its own deal and debt restructuring ? 
  just get a vague mandate by referendum , hellas got its deal , the uncertainty card can not be played twice . 
  the only thing this proves , and changes , is that this government is willing to drive off a cliff to get what it wants . 
  so their threats are more truthful . 
  but is that really a partner to help at extreme political cost ? 
  you 're sending a dead warrant to the political establishment in the other helped countries . 
  the northern countries will , if it even passes , commit political suicide . 
  again i have no idea what will happen , but i do n't see a clear reason this changes anything significant . 
  at best they 'll humour it for a while because it looks bad to ignore a democratic vote , no matter how dubious . 
  this was from january ( check video date ) . 
  negotiations carried on , despite valiant efforts to prevent and sabotage them . 
  my favourite one ? 
  [ when visiting italy to get bailout number three and sweet debt relief ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/08/uk-eurozone-greece-varoufakis-idukkbn0lc0qk20150208 ) :  italian officials , i ca n't tell you from which big institution , approached me to tell me they backed us but they ca n't tell the truth because italy also risks bankruptcy and they are afraid of the reaction from germany . 
  let 's face it , italy 's debt situation is unsustainable . 
  i think the italian response was along the lines of :  sure , here 's your money , no strings attached . 
  you are a very good negotiating partner and speak as if you have our interest at heart . 
  especially good job on increasing market confidence in our fine country and helping the odds parliament would pass your every desire by directly appealing to politician and citizen alike . 
  interesting . 
  a switch to more pin and chip at the same time could perhaps reduce tax evasion too , so if the additional currency was all digital ... 
  eh , it 's not so big a deal , biden is still around after his delightful shoulder massages . 
  dijsselbloem 's statement that the result was ' regrettable for the future of greece ' is n't actually strong language ( imho ) , especially in the context of what athens leadership in general and varoufakis in particular have broadcasted . 
  well the euro is already in a terrible place , there 's no need for a further devaluation . 
  honestly greece 's biggest potential is as trading hub and as access to europe for everything that travels through suez . 
  since most goods will be passing through the country , having a fixed currency for trade would be important . 
  it 's part of why we in the netherlands benefit so much from using the same currency as our eastern neighbours : it lets us easily import stuff german consumers purchase and export their products . 
  if currency exchange was involved , they 'd probably prefer hamburg instead . 
  rotterdam is n't the biggest port in europe by trading our own goods . 
  wait , is varoufakis alberich or siegfried ? 
  i 'd assume the former , as he has clearly stolen das rheingold , even after rhein maiden merkel rejected his advances . 
  i do n't think dijsselbloem really dislikes him or something . 
  he 's never said something other than in response to a varoufakis statement , like that there were negotiations underway with big european concessions ( which the dutchman called a fantasy ) . 
  as far as i know dijsselbloem has n't even responded to varoufakis saying the eurogroup he chairs is practicing terrorism . 
  well until the deus ex machina really . 
  and here was i thinking there would n't be a bailout . 
  yeah , his promises were clear bullshit . 
  better run before he had to face them and explain his statements to voters . 
  i 'm sure his successor will be delighted to fail to meet varoufakis ' fantasies and to be judged on this . 
  greece is a net massive importer . 
  they 'd run out of euros soon before one can say `` this new emmentaler tastes a lot like feta '' . 
  ( i checked this yesterday , there were only a few countries like france , uk and usa with higher net import , source was from 2011 or 2010 . ), 
  from what i 've seen , read , etc. , there 's at least a part of the ochi vote that realises the uncertainty , they embrace it . 
  i hope that the majority know what they 're betting on , it 'd be really sad if they were drawn in by tsipras ' demagogy and fantast varoufakis . 
  not necessary , no ecb money means no greek money , so that 's the real decision . 
  i 'd rather see greece take this step itself , because the few cashless weeks it would have to suffer to invite the inevitable will be terrible ... but the effects will reverberate for ages too . 
  portugal looks to be paying back their share , so formally they might be down on the whole . 
  of course , realistically you ca n't write off the entire loan since these are , at the end of the day , deals far beyond what a market would offer ( so informally it 's free money ) , and the loans came when other countries when they needed it most , so the opportunity cost was severe , whereas the opposite was true in lisbon , where the money could n't have come at a better time . 
  when all is said and done however , the portugal deal might have created a net profit for * all * parties involved . 
  lisbon 's benefit is obvious , while the eurozone countries eliminated dubious bonds from their exposed banks at decent costs , restored market confidence , hopefully a stronger portugal , etc. 
  i 'm not saying it was the best way to insure that for the other eurozone countries per se , just that on whole it was good . 
  i bet there will be a cheeky nation that will ask varoufakis how much of a debt cut he wants . 
  then on the next day announce a referendum on the haircut issue due in a few weeks . 
  it would instantly negate any greek claim of having a mandate to cut debt , since this one will be much clearer . 
  it would probably also be a very popular move in some lender countries , and counteract opposition criticism . 
  varoufakis is a fantast . 
  heh , that 's great, 
  caribbean island saba has mount scenery , which stands nearly a kilometre tall . 
  it counts !, 
  suck it belgium , your name might be shorter to write and does n't require an off-putting definite article , but we have a mountain practically none of us visits . 
  i was responding to someone comparing the academic credentials of finance ministers . 
  stubb is a perfect example of someone in the eurogroup with good credentials , since he got his phd from the london school of economics , a prestigious institutions ( unlike where varoufakis and dijsselbloem studied ) . 
  you 're free to dislike other parts , it 's just offtopic . 
  sadly it is not original . 
  i 'm a fraud !,

  this seems way more consistent with terrorism than scaremongering . 
  i think * your comment * is highly misleading , or is at the very least unsourced i have 7.5 sources . 
  they 're lending extremely far below market rates . 
  from an economic perspective , this is free money . 
   second , this will happen sooner or later , because greek banks are insolvable ( who lends money to insolvable entities ? 
  nobody , not even the ecb ) . 
  this is an important point . 
  in order for banks to get ela , they need collateral . 
  the greek banks do n't have anything , nor will anyone loan them money . 
  so they write a loan to themselves . 
  a worthless piece of paper , until the greek government guaranteed it . 
  so athens puts its signature on the dotted line . 
  of course , with the breakdown of negotiations with the partners sure to the sudden referendum , greece was de facto in default . 
  a country that ca n't pay its own bills ca n't guarantee anyone else 's either . 
  it makes total sense for the ecb to refuse further ela to greek banks until greece is saved again . 
  accepting useless paper sets a destructive precedent . 
  but do n't take my word for it , take it from someone who has been guaranteeing these dubious loans ( despite the strongly disapproving time , he still continued the practice in office ) : http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2014/05/11/how-the-greek-banks-secured-an-additional-hidden-e41-billion-bailout-from-european-taxpayers/, 
  if the eurozone leaders do n't want to go beyond the previous pre-referendum agreement , a rejection means an end to further negotiations . 
  that means that for the foreseeable future , greek banks will not be able to service costumers since they need the ecb for all their money . 
  the ecb wo n't lend to the greek banks , because they were a previously unable to find collateral . 
  to get collateral then they loaned money to themselves and had the government guarantee it . 
  now , however , we find an athens in default , and penniless parties guarantee nothing . 
  no collateral means no ecb loans means no money at greek banks . 
  thus , the entire greek economy implodes . 
  unless they make new money . 
  exit euro , enter drachma 2.0 . 
  at times this does indeed remind me of discworld .
