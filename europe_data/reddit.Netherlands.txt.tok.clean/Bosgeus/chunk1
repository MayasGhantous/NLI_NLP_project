   absolutely . 
  germany , regardless of public opinion , would have zero choice but to aid their allies . 
  it 's not like the nato treaty was a contract with the devil signed by blood and funded by selling ones soul . 
  it 's a treaty , ink on a paper , of course they have a choice . 
   are you saying countries like germany would not be able to weasel out of calling a green men revolution an `` attack '' ? 
  they would be able to weasel out simply by showing that 2 dozen operational aircraft is not going to win a war . 
  do n't even need asymmetrical warfare for that . 
   being attacked in any form , there was n't much response to russian forces crossing the estonian border and kidnapping a border official . 
  it was essentially an attack . 
  regardless , if russians invade the baltics and kill 100 americans while doing so , you 've ensured full military backing from the american public instantly . 
  eventhough 100 americans would never stand a chance that 's a pretty credible deterrent . 
  ca n't really blame citizens for feeling uneasy about a religion that inspires people to kill innocent folk by the dozens in public places in your country . 
  ` killed jews ' , where have i seen this before ... 
  mighty zimbabwe forming an anti-western axis with glorious russia . 
  this must send shivers down the spines of our leaders . 
  ( if they had a spine ), 
   and economy larger than that of the united states , not anymore .

  is supposed to do , but has never proven itself , and would need significant constant presence in fin ; land if they intend to . 
  i think people feel more confident if they can defend themselves , than rely on others . 
   you 're wrong on this one , i 'm afraid not , converting energy into different forms of energy and storage is always less efficient than using it for your purpose right away . 
   most energy in internal combustion engines gets converted to waste heat heat is used to power the pistons as well , there 's waste heat , but the same goes for energy plants . 
   and that number is around 25 % efficiency for icus . 
  for petrol . 
  the thermal efficiency of a modern diesel is around 45 % . 
   even coal plants reach 40 % efficiency . 
  not even close , most operational coal plants are somewhere around 20/25 % . 
  yes . 
  city 's have an additional branche ` toezicht ' ( oversight ) , which are a poor mans police . 
  they 're not really police , and mostly write parking tickets , they do not carry firearms . 
   ... because of good social safety nets , free education ( most of the time ) , and low cost healthcare . 
  a lot has changed for the worse though since 2011/2008 . 
  europe is not what it was anymore . 
  and where in europe might that be ? 
  moscow , belarus , crimea , or maybe switserland ? 
   that would work much better , but for the us at least that would be incredibly expensive . 
   did n't we just hypothetically made 320 billion available ? 
  say you give that to the poorest 20 % of society ( in the form of things i said ) . 
  for the poorest 60 million people in the us , that would be 5333 dollar per person per year . 
  that 's quite significant , without raising an extra penny in taxes . 
  i do n't know , i think the design is good . 
  it 's not colorful , but it looks good . 
  i think the issue is that the design of the flag should be based on something , the danger would be that a new design would be based on one country too much . 
  if somebody would come up with an alternative , i would judge the particular alternative i gues . 
  i have seen some people flying the eu flag on their daily flagposts not the national flag , for me it does not mean much though . 
  it symbolizes european solidarity , cooperation , unity and a common future , but currently this is all hollow to me in the present day europe . 
  therefor i would not wish to display it , and it seems kind of empty , a lie if you will , when i look at it . 
   no , not with our system . 
  colleges and healthcare services would just increase price with more funding . 
  thus more people would be put on aid and we would need an even more tax revenue . 
   then give it to the citizens , not the schools/hospitals . 
  for example we 've healthcare insurance grants if you 're below a certain income , the tax services give you a monthly amount to pay your private healthcare insurance , and study scholarship if you 're below a certain income ( a gift once you graduate ) . 
  they probably feel more confident not being a neighbour of russia . 
  they only have to fear for gotland , for most of the rest they would have to go through finland first , and finland does have an army . 
   equipment , tactics , planning , budget and so on . 
  which is one of the reasons the electorate in finland is n't so happy about nato . 
  many fear joining nato would turn their army into an expeditionary force running errands around the world but not being able to defend their own country . 
  sounds like a pretty good idea from an american point of view . 
  you could slash your defense budget in half and still have the strongest army in the world . 
  that 320 billion dollar per year would do miracles for healthcare and education . 
   or have turkish citizenship aswell . 
  she wants to get rid of her turkish passport . 
  aiding pkk now too is she ? 
   and in the worst case , you get deported . 
  tell that to ebru , she would probably love to be deported now , but is n't allowed to leave the country . 
  they do have logistics aircraft , but this was an intelligence aircraft , not a logistics aircraft . 
  i was speaking from their perspective . 
  but fair enough , i know poles generally are n't very fond of germans . 
  i think there would be more europeans moving to the us then vice versa . 
  americans like to complain , but the us is a better country than 95 % of europe . 
   it 's their own fault they 're willing to pay . 
  it would be kind of nice to , you know , be happy these funds are there and consider that other people pay to improve your life ? 
  then they should make sure more us influence is n't needed . 
  the uk and eu will continue the current relation for the time these negotiations will take . 
  nothing will change short term , the uk would remain for at least 2 years in the eu , in which all people will have time to adapt to a new situation and the details of the new situation are formed . 
  i kind of liked romania do n't get me wrong , but the country is an inhabited garbage dump that 's under construction ( and only projects with eu funding tend to ever get finished ) . 
  russia is just better , roads are better , houses are better , city 's are better and neater etc. 
  turning the energy from combustion directly into movement is on its turn more efficient than converting it to a different form of energy , distributing it , storing it , and then converting it into movement . 
  pretty much annuls that advantage . 
   is the tail rotor also spinning by the airstream [ ... ] i gues so , but without torque from the engine the helicopter does n't have the same tendency to rotate . 
  the same happened , welcome to the euro . 
  so it crashed into the ground at a speed above 252 km/h . 
  i do n't see anyone walking away from that . 
   the other option was dropping like a stone . 
  like a fixed wing aircraft , a helicopter can land without an engine . 
  it 's called autorotation ( engine is decoupled , and the rotor is powered by the airstream created by the descent ) , all single engined helicopters need to be able to do this . 
  in this case it appears the rotor broke , then there 's not much to be done anymore . 
  except it is . 
   by stablizing libya , the problema is solved . 
  ghadafi held the hordes back , there 's no saying a future government will . 
  also stabilizing libya will take years , years in which we will receive millions of illegal immigrants if we do not have a short term solution . 
  as for the rest , there will be no common border zone if there are no borders . 
  wether italy is a founding member , or in agreement with the commission is irrelevant . 
  if we can not control our outer borders , in all likelihood the common ` border ' zone/anarchy will eventually fall apart , possibly into smaller border zones . 
  the words ` mini schengen ' has even already been mentioned by ministers . 
  we 're already quite far down the line , and there 's no patience left for more years of this stuff . 
  that 's nice shakespeare , but in the short term we 're facing mass unbriddled immigration that 's unsustainable . 
   the only solution is to stabilize libya so africans will not come in large numbers .
