  affiliates that you do not want to be affiliated with ? 
  at least it has a better army than poland , and is located in a safer spot and has no overseas territories as well . 
   there 's a difference between being a partner and a serf . 
  like equal contributions towards a relationship for example . 
   and as one of the few members we keep our military spending on the required minimum . 
  only since very recently , poland has n't done that for a long time . 
   first thought was `` now they 'll treat all muslims much worse '' . 
  ` it does n't matter so many innocent people died and had to suffer , now the affiliates of those who did it might get treated worse . ', 
   i remember people talking about how nuts the arabs were with their islam and 15 years later we find turkey in the same box . 
  airbnb works fine though , you rent an entire apartment , no problem doing that with children . 
   you ca n't easily pull down terraces without removing all of them , and when you do you need to move the people living in them into new housing understandible , here we just build around it . 
  most of these terrace blocks are from the '60s and '70s and were build around the city center ( usually just outside the canals of the old fortifications ) after that there were was a population and wealth boom , as well as large migration from rural to city 's and we just build these kind of homes around it . 
  usually the ` two under one roof ' around the terracesses , and the ` free standing ' ones around these again . 
  but i live in a city that was very easy to grow ( around it was practically nothing but farmland ) , though we 're reaching our limits and the new construction sites are going to merge villages . 
   plus , the houses may be small , they may not be new , but they are generally modernised and it 's not bad housing , it 's just small . 
  agreed , would n't want to live in it though . 
  advantage of these larger free standing homes is that there 's all sort of things in between , gardens are usually neat colorful , packed with trees , bushes and plants , the municipality keeps everything else in neat shape , there 's parcs , canals and lakes in between . 
  it 's generally pretty green , lots of birds and animal life . 
  would n't want to swap that ever , i feel like an industrial revolution labourer if i ever had to move to such a sad neighbourhood of square packed stonework . 
  i come from a city and this would be upper-lower class labour city blocks . 
  more common newer neighbourhoods are usually like [ this ] ( http://www.grinthuizen.nl/files/grinthuizen/0_impressies_grinthuizen_rheden/vrijstaande_woningen_type_b_fase_2/type_b_fase_2_grinthuizen_vrijstaande_woning.jpg ) , middle class ` free standing home ' , or [ this ] ( http://www.veerbouw.nl/assets/images/wilp-de-2-1-kap-3d-web.jpg ) ` two under one roof ' lower middle class . 
  i did n't know the uk had such an outdated housing market . 
  large for in central london maybe . 
  but they 're not all bad , the new ones are often pretty nice , like [ these ] ( http://hrtrendinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/rijtjeshuis.jpg ) , or [ these ] ( http://cdn.makeover.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rijtjeshuis-2-nrcreader.jpg ) , or [ these ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dd/7e/2b/dd7e2b702091921dbe9e7a5b02ef9221.jpg ) the older ones can be extremely ugly though , like [ this ] ( http://images.nrc.nl/mexhdh8n3a4zdjzifdzjdqg8uzq=/1280x/s3/static.nrc.nl/images/w1920/2111amstagen.jpg ) more examples [ here ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=rijtjeshuis&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=971&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiru5ny3zxmahwqfjokhzcjdvyq_auibigb#imgrc=rgfyjj_h7haugm%3a ), 
   ... mehmet kaplan ... -----  ... and before that spokesperson for the muslim council of sweden ( 2005 -- 2006 ) and young muslims of sweden ( 2000 -- 2002 ) . 
  he was also a founding member of the organization swedish muslims for peace and justice , a muslim peace movement , as well as a strong supporter of the swedish peace movement . 
  he was a member of the board of the green party between 2003 and 2011 . 
   kaplan was on board the ship to gaza flotilla which tried to send necessities through the israeli embargo of the gaza strip . 
  [ 1 ] the israeli armed forces boarded the flotilla on 31 may 2010 and the clash killed 9 flotilla members in the heat of battle . 
  [ 2 ]  on 1 july 2014 , in a fight racism now seminar held in visby , ** kaplan compared the young muslims from sweden who went to fight for any force in the syrian civil war ( including the islamic state ) with those young swedes who volunteered to fight for finland against russia in the winter war during the second world war . 
  ** kaplan commented that his statements had been misrepresented , but admitted to having chosen his words poorly . 
  [ 3 ]  in a turkish newspaper interview , ** kaplan said that it is natural for sweden to recognize palestine as a state , and that the `` occupied territories will , if allah willing , be freed , and east jerusalem will become the capital of palestine . '', 
  further he said that israel will be forced to a peace agreement . 
  [ 4 ] **  kaplan is the first swedish minister who is a practising muslim . 
  he ** has also been labeled being an islamist ** by various personalities , including the previous mp , nalin pekgul of the swedish social democratic party . 
   in april 2016 kaplan received criticism because ** he had connections to islamists in turkey ** [ 5 ] in particular he ** met the swedish leader ilhan sent\u00fcrk of the turkish nationalist group the grey wolves and on several occations with people from the islamist organization milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs . 
  ** [ 6 ] this has raised questions in sweden about the stance of kaplan concerning extremism . 
  [ 7 ] nice minister you have there sweden . 
   the thing is we simply can not hope to build a sufficient defense to completely deter any offense militarily . 
   i still do not see why the us would want to give up its allies in europe they do n't , it 's just that you can help them pay for it if you 're too cheap to pay for something yourself . 
  pretty fair deal . 
  makes plenty of sense , most of the us presence in germany/italy is logistic/operational/command / intelligence support facilities for us deployments overseas , there 's no practical reason to move that to poland . 
  if you 're afraid of russia , maybe it 's time ireland got an army too and contribute something . 
  a lot of [ these ] ( http://www.vansantvoort.nl/wp-content/uploads/46_rijtjeshuis.large_.jpg ) kind of houses though . 
  but still , better than a flat . 
  i know most poles are cynical and paranoid , look we would n't do it because we think it 's fun . 
  we 've other things our army can do as well , aruba/curacao for example is in more constant danger than poland , better to have as much of our forces ready at home than in poland . 
   with the aid usa provided to philippines in recent south china dispute ( their trade balance with china is orders of magnitude bigger than europe 's with russia , yet they sent huge fleet there ) . 
  the us is pivoting towards asia , they 're also pretty exasperated with europe regarding defense , i expect they 'll bail out of europe more and more if we do n't change . 
   there is a big dutch community in tasmania interesting . 
  it is my experience that pretty much every dutch person has some distant relative in either australia or canada . 
  there was lots of emigration from the netherlands towards canada , australia , new zealand and the us shortly after ww2 . 
  ( one of the reasons was our government supporting that due to overpopulation ) i have distant family in oceania as well . 
  ( and planning to visit it soon as well , possibly emigrating if all things allow it ), 
   every member can act on their own . 
  and as a result not recieve nato support . 
   dunno i live in poland since my birth and i fell free as any other european now and back then ... you are watching and reading too much propaganda those days i asume . 
  perhaps , when i hear a government talking about somebody else as a ` existential threat ' i can only think of north korea . 
  and if they would later complement that with ` poland threatens full nuclear war , warns will turn russia into glass desert dear leader be willing ' the transformation would be complete . 
  maybe they would n't even need to strike . 
  but cyber attacks on facilities , assasinations of all the brains behind the program , sabotage missions etc. 
  nato would probably do nothing in that case . 
  that 's an exaggeration , the point of the government will be the same , some more direct involvement in the government would be something i percieve as positive . 
  because they pay a lot of money towards that army , and we treat that army as our own defense force because we 're to cheap to maintain one ourselves . 
   it surprises me how similar dutch people are to australians australia was discovered by a dutchman after all ( willem janszoon ) , 
  nationstates for neglecting their armed forces too much . 
  european integration is only mentioned because it 's the only way to keep some form of firepower without increasing budgets . 
  though it 's unlikely it would work , all current integrations pretty much end up in failures and disappointment . 
  on the short term there 's really only one option ; invest in defense . 
   we like having a bunch of useless armies and depending on america . 
  apparently yes , because nobody wants to spare a penny for an army . 
  it does n't have to be much , the 2 % would be sufficient if everybody adhered to that . 
  and let 's be honest , 2 % of our annual income is no fortune . 
   and there 's even some doubt if the us wo n't accept a baltic occupation to prevent a nuclear exchange . 
  see the `` nuclear deescalation '' strategy talked about in russia . 
  that 's why i mentioned rapid deployment , this is the only way to defend the baltics . 
  russia should be able to occupy all baltic states within 24 hours , the only way to defend the baltics would be to get a force in there within 24 hours that can at the very least increase that 24 hours to 48 or 96 for more to get in . 
   ut penetrating deep into europe is mission impossible . 
  they can penetrate very deep into europe within days . 
  they could n't hold it though , but they would n't want to either . 
  warsaw should be possible within 3 days for example . 
   i 'd even question their ability to `` mop '' poland as easily as it would seem on paper . 
  they can mop it with 2 hands on their back . 
   its a 40 million nation with much hatred toward russia , and has plenty of armed militias after all . 
  with no credible defense force . 
   anyway , what we can safely assume is also that russia would fail to deliver a striking blow to franco-anglo-german military complex , not to mention italy also being a significant arms exporter . 
  the german army is practically non-existent . 
  they do have some ground troops/equipment in supply , but have only around 40 operational airplanes . 
  the assymetry between an army like that and russia would make the defense of holland in 1940 look like a success . 
  it 's all about who can scale up the fastest and who can keep up , there 's really nobody east of france who could keep up symmetry , therefor it would result in a resounding defeat . 
  then i 'm glad the germans refused the base , and we should n't bother providing any further assurances to poland . 
  they 've got the logistics more than covered . 
  also most of the land mass does n't need a defense , the sheer size , lack of population and infrastructure and harsh climate is a defense on itself . 
  as a matter of fact , i did . 
  ** [ 1 ] ( http://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel265 ) it 's a multiplier , if you click ` vorige ' ( previous ) you can see the articles related to insulting ( art . 
  261-266 criminal code ) insulting a foreign head of state raises the maximum punishment of regular offending with 1/3th . 
  yes , but insulting a foreign head of a friendly state was added in 1980 ( at least according to wikipedia , let me see if i can find the law ), 
  he 's actually violating the law here , his story should probably be seen in light of the discussion sparked by the german comedian about this particular law . 
  the ruling party ( vvd ) and a few others are now busy drafting a proposal to annul the ` majesteitsschennis ' law . 
  erdogan could sue him as well for this .
