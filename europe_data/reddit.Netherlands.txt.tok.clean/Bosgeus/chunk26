  we 'll see , there is n't anything we can do about it . 
  for all it matters , i hope you 're right . 
  i did n't say you did . 
  wether it 's troubling is a matter of perspective , i find it extremely troubling , so much so that i 'm contemplating emigrating out of europe in the future . 
  oh well the occasional airfield or metro exploding , machine gun spraying in a cinema , people cheering for it in city 's like amsterdam and the hague , teachers of elemenatary schools who do n't know how to handle children celebrating and cheering the death of innocent belgians . 
  that sort of thing . 
   these people originate from the rurual areas in eastern turkey . 
  many of them hold conservative views that align with erdogans policies . 
  this does not mean that they stir ethnic uprisings here . 
  it means they 're not integrated though , which is what he/she said . 
   one theory is that they want to divide the people in the countries between muslims and non muslims , there are two basic reasons why this stuff happens . 
  people who blow themselves up in these attacks do n't do it to ` divide people ' , because they would do so without killing themselves . 
  the people who blow themselves up do so because they believe they 'll be rewarded in the after life for killing unbelievers . 
  now those that plan/direct the attacks have different motives . 
  which is probably also why in both recent attacks ( paris , brussels ) they dump their bombs and do n't kill themselves . 
  the flag of the future belgian state ? 
  in the netherlands you can get subsidies if you let your cattle graze freely in the summer/spring . 
  so that happens quite often on farms . 
   edit : oh , and it seems the netherlands already had a herd of 24 in 2013 . who [ knew ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/wisent#wisenten_in_nederland ) , til . 
  apparently they 're creating herds in different spots , still working on it . 
  aw poor turks , wo n't anyone think of the turks . 
  . za stands for zuid-afrika , dutch for south africa . 
  when the abbreviation of the country was made dutch was still an official language in south africa , now it 's ` afrikaans ' , a humorous variant of dutch . 
  in afrikaans it 's ` suid afrika ' . 
  all means of self defense are illegal there , even pepperspray . 
  which is fine as long as authorities function and can and do protect you , the moment they do n't there should be serious discource about means of self defense . 
  that 's what it usually ends up being though , as deportation just does n't work and does n't happen . 
  neither does voluntary emigration , these people do n't leave refugee camps in turkey because they want to temporarily stay in europe . 
  we 're not all like him . 
  ah yes the old ' a muslim killing in the name of islam has nothing to do with islam ' . 
  tell me more . 
  it 's spelled ` vrouw ' in dutch . 
  but you 're right , she 's speaking dutch . 
  belgium has a high state debt and low household debt , the netherlands has a low state debt and high household debt . 
  regardless the guy is just having his panties in a twist and blowing some steam of for some reason , it 's not that interesting to make these simple comparisons , and offtopic here as well . 
  hmm ? 
  on paper , in reality it meant for all of africa , the middle east , and the rest of asia . 
  would 've been for all the other continents as well if they had boarded a vessel en mass . 
  does the washington post have a lot of readers in the us ? 
  it 's funny that they 're , for european standards , a politically left media outlet . 
  never knew that kind of ideology would do well in the us , especially not with low quality journalism in this case . 
   but this is n't a world with open borders where anyone can go wherever they please . 
  it seemed to be exactly that in europe though . 
  i saw an interview of some residents in amsterdam , one of them said brussels pretty much asked for it , the other was understanding to cheering and celebration of the attacks on brussel in some amsterdam neighbourhoods because ` nobody cared about ankara ' . 
  it 's a rude awakening sometimes to see what kind of people there are . 
  for those who understand dutch ; [ 1 ] ( http://www.telegraaf.nl/tv/nieuws/binnenland/25460888/___brussel_lokte_aanslag_uit___.html ), 
  ah that explains a lot , my bad . 
  belgium is poorer on practically all metrics , lower average wages [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) , higher debt [ 2 ] ( https://www.google.nl/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;idim=country:nl:be:de&amp;hl=nl&amp;dl=nl#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:nl:be&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=nl&amp;dl=nl&amp;ind=false ) , lower gdp per capita [ 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita ) [ 4 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita ) and gni [ 5 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gni_ ( nominal , _ atlas_method ) _ per_capita ) our healthcare is better as well . 
  [ 6 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/expat-health/11384780/netherlands-tops-health-care-rankings-with-uk-in-14th-place.html ) still it 's a rich country , and still it 's politically a mess . 
  belgium is still one of the best places on earth to live in . 
  belgium is a good place to live , certainly compared to albania . 
  does n't negate the fact that politically they 're a mess , especially for west european standards . 
   just , fuck off !, 
  ... and of course you 're dutch . 
  god , i hate you guys . 
  i love you too . 
  it was practically one terror attack , just in the form of two bombs . 
  ( locations ), 
  no there are n't , they usually ca n't prove any crimes committed by people who went to syria . 
  most they can do is surveillance , but that 's far from effective as we 've seen . 
   i have no way of really verifying that but lots of things i 've seen here make me believe this is not the case in many aspects . 
  being better functioning than belgium is n't a really high standard . 
   who is we ? 
   and frankly i 'm surprised there has n't been a terrorist attack here could be that the german government functions better as well . 
  we have n't had one either . 
  i understand that , it 's unfortunate . 
  there are only a handful of european countries active on the international stage ( uk , france , netherlands , belgium , denmark ) and there 's just not enough will and capabilities between them to do what sometimes needs to be done . 
  the solution to that is not those countries doing more , but rather everyone doing a fair share . 
  a fair share for ireland is not large at all , and would be perfectly reasonably affordable . 
  and the worst yet is that states that do n't spend on security can keep lower taxes , therefor harming states that do spend on security . 
  it 's a crab-bucket mentality and ultimately only pulling each other down . 
  maybe a european defense budget might be the best solution to that , but i would n't trust the eu handling that . 
  an easier solution is maybe a european defense fund . 
  we create a reference budget ( for example 1,5 % of gdp , which is about average for european nato states ) all countries spending less than 1,5 % pay all that they spend less than 1,5 % into a european fund , that 's than diverted to the military ( s ) doing the task that is deemed necessary by the eu . 
  or it 's used to create a european defense force parallel to national militaries , which could ultimately grow to be the only defense force over the course of time . 
  maybe even better . 
   eh , our naval service is grand although 5 or 6 more ships would be ideal  your naval service is a coast guard . 
  the heaviest weapon they 've is a board gun . 
  you could probably scrap half the fleet of patrol vessels and replace them with 2 or 3 decent frigates . 
  acquiring a fighter jet fleet should n't be too hard either , lots of f16 's for sale soon with the introduction of the f-35 , otherwise gripens are affordable , and saab even offers lease contracts which means it does n't require a large initial investment . 
  you can , by you know , buying some decent planes and a ship or two . 
  the french can do that as well , half the budgets and say ' i wish we could do more , but let the british and italians do more ' . 
  maybe if the brits had n't fucked them up they would 've . 
  ireland does n't want to spend money on defense , so france should do it . 
  that 's basically what he says . 
  the irish are free riders , if anyone needs to do more it 's them . 
  that 's pretty common though , fighterjets are fragile equipment , small deficiencies can make them uncontrollable . 
  they 're not made to be fool proof or safe either . 
   and the big nations like france , germany and spain or even italy should do more . 
  and why should n't ireland do more ? 
  sure . 
  you were talking about europe , not the eu . 
  all of them are in europe . 
  we almost had one in the netherlands as well , right before prinsjesdag ( 15th september 2015 ) the military intelligence managed to stop a jihadist cell that was going to do an attack during prinsjesdag supposedly aimed at the parliament building . 
  it should n't be a problem , just deny them access to the detention facilities and let government agencies do what they were supposed to do . 
  he does n't only consider them trade terms , they * are * trade terms . 
  no common market without freedom of movement . 
  of course you can sign an fta without freedom of movement , but that will have significantly more barriers , and increasingly so - , than the common market . 
   1 ) white house gets repainted red , white and blue . 
   yes , yes ( rubs hands evilly ) , united states becomes the united provinces .
