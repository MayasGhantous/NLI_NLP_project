   i really do n't get how these people even exist !, 
  they 're stimulated and steered by european anarchist/extreme left activists/movements . 
  still are made currently . 
  actually i do n't really care who has the bigger ` dickinson ' , it 's just that your original argument is incorrect . 
   i am talking about large financial institutions that can facilitate international banking . 
  and europe has more of those than the us as well . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_largest_financial_services_companies_by_revenue ), 
  that 's not a list of financial sectors though , just a city were a lot has accumulated . 
  and even then it 's a measurement of competitiveness , not actual size . 
  the two are of course related , but there 's no linear relation between them . 
  a nation with a large sector but evenly distributed around the country would score lower than a nation with a small ( er ) sector that 's concentrated in a single city . 
  that 's probably larger in europe as well . 
  i doubt it , europe probably has a bigger banking sector . 
  just look at the [ top 10 ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hv4iit6t5t4/ufm2x33czki/aaaaaaaabgq/wg4d3oointm/s1600/biggest+bank+world+2013-assets.png ) largest banks in the world for example . 
  only one of them is american , 5 are european . 
  some european countries have a banking sector that holds assets and liabilities in amounts of 500 % of their respective gdp . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/06/banking-system-liabilities-as-percent-of-gdp.png ) [ 2 ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02521/newpic_9855_jpg_2521341a.jpg ), 
  that might very well be the shortest war in history , without armed forces and all that . 
  the ussr already reincarnated into the eu , can we have two neo-ussr 's now ? 
  having had english in school from a young age ( starts in elementary school ) and only subtitles ( no voice overs like the french ) helps . 
  and hearing/reading it everyday on the tv , the radio , videogames etc. 
  that 's nice , but that 's not what he said . 
   but of all we know he just leaked it . 
   i probably disagree with your unspecified definition of racism then . 
  it 's not something that requires your agreement . 
   race and racism are n't simply defined by skin color alone . 
  they 're defined by race . 
   n general speech it is often the same , antisemitism for example is regarded as a form racism regardless of context or skin colour . 
  jews are/were generally considered to be a race , not just a religion . 
  based on the orthodox interpretation that you can only be a jew if your mother was/is one . 
  so that 's comparing apples to peaches . 
   anyway , my argument does n't change if i would have used ` ethnic discrimination ' . 
  actually it does , that 's the only way to phrase it correctly , otherwise your ` argument ' would be bollocks . 
  the euro was likely to collapse around 2011 , eventhough it did n't i wouldn ; t blame those who predicted it . 
  by now we 're in calmer waters , but things are structurally as wobbly as they ever were , and the next shock could very well lead to the previously predicted events . 
  muslims make up a larger voter base , it 's only natural . 
  they 're not searching for a contractor , they already have one . 
   their ethnicity is moroccan . 
  the possible presence of a moroccan passport does not make otherwise racist statements okay . 
  maroccan is not a race , therefor it ca n't be racist . 
   ... and do treat the group as an ethnicity . 
  ethnicity is not a race either . 
   although nuclear power is considered a low carbon power generation source , [ 1 ] its legal inclusion with renewable energy power sources has been a subject of debate and classification . 
  statutory definitions of renewable energy usually exclude many present nuclear energy technologies , with notable exceptions in the states of utah , [ 2 ] and arizona in the united states , [ 3 ] where only a particular implementation of nuclear fission with `` waste '' / fuel recycling meets the state 's criteria . 
  [ 4 ] dictionary sourced definitions of renewable energy technologies often omit or explicitly exclude mention to every nuclear energy source , with an exception made for the natural nuclear decay heat generated within the earth/geothermal energy . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  the most common fuel used in conventional nuclear fission power stations , uranium-235 is `` non-renewable '' according to the energy information administration , the organization however is silent on the recycled fuel of mox . 
  [ 6 ] similarly , the national renewable energy laboratory does not mention nuclear power in its `` energy basics '' definition . 
  [ 7 ]  in 1987 , the world commission on environment and development ( wced ) classified fission reactors that produce more fissile nuclear fuel than they consume ( breeder reactors , and if developed , fusion power ) among conventional renewable energy sources , such as solar and falling water . 
  [ 8 ] the american petroleum institute likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable , but that breeder reactor nuclear fuel is considered renewable and sustainable , and while conventional fission leads to waste streams that remain a concern for millennia , the waste from efficiently burnt up spent fuel requires storage for no more than a thousand years . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] the monitoring and storage of radioactive waste products is also required upon the use of other renewable energy sources , such as geothermal energy . 
  [ 12 ] [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_power_proposed_as_renewable_energy ), 
   it definitely has , still not enough . 
  that 's great , because it will only become cheaper and more efficient . 
   http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/eu-to-raise-minimum-import-price-for-chinese-solar-modules-_100018620/ these measures have been introduced because of state subsidizing/state financed dumping . 
  they 've nothing to do with actual production costs . 
  still not one source , still sucking that thumb i see . 
   wait are you telling me you can produce in germany at the same costs as in china ? 
  they 're [ close ] ( http://www.pv-magazine.com/typo3temp/pics/02012_priceindex_pvi_february_2016_2sp_12c3bc4fae.jpg ) enough . 
   solar panels are extremely expensive even when made in china . 
  that has [ rather changed ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/peterdiamandis/files/2014/09/price-history-silicon1.png ) quite significantly . 
   so expensive they are in no way cost effective . 
  i do n't even [ know ] ( http://www.wholesundesigns.com/uploads/1/2/3/7/12373031/1937316.jpg?420 ) how one person could come up with so much bullshit . 
   the sources of energy used to manufacture components can be critical : `` the same manufacturing process in germany would result in less than half of the total emissions that such a process would entail in china . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/energy/lifecycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-solar-wind-energy ) i propose that the next statement you make will be backed up by a source , that thumb of yours should be nearly empty . 
  it still is n't , moving the goal post does n't change that what you said was wrong . 
  besides , 72 % of the co2 emission from solarpv and wind energy are caused by their production , they can be made much more efficient by moving the industry away from china . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sources-of-renewable-energy-greenhouse-gas-emissions.jpg ), 
   so nuclear is a solution . 
   i do n't know , it 's not on the long term , but it could be on the short term . 
   every recycling proces still produces waste , we 're dealing with a finite resource that 'll last hundred of thousands of years . 
  -----  current usage is about 66,000 tu/yr . 
  thus the world 's present measured resources of uranium ( 5.9 mt ) in the cost category around 1.5 times present spot prices and used only in conventional reactors , are enough to last for about 90 years . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/supply-of-uranium.aspx ) you 're gon na have to back your ` hundred of thousands of years ' . 
   that project has been scrapped as its too expensive , we 'll be adding a third basin to the coo trois ponts plant . 
  -----  not that that is necessarily feasible , but it shows that there might be ways . 
   nuclear is by far the lowest on co2 emissions . 
   no it is n't . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2011/ph241/ali1/images/f1big.gif ), 
   our priority is reducing co2 emissions and air pollution . 
  short term , yes , long term , no . 
   besides a closed fuel cycle is possible with nuclear energy . 
  closed fuel cycle still produces waste , you 're still dealing with a finite resource as well . 
   pumped storage is a mature technology . 
  it is n't , people are still looking into ways of artificial pumped storage . 
  the belgian idea for example with elevated artificial islands of the coast . 
  not that that is necessarily feasible , but it shows that there might be ways . 
   we have no idea what we 're working towards , there 's no way to predict what technologies will be available in 100 years . 
  we do , towards a circular economy . 
  what we have no idea about is exactly how . 
  it 's sad for the other 59 deaths as well . 
  nor if it was leaked or not . 
   co2 capture is considered a solution , yes . 
  a solution to climate change , not a solution to waste production or finite sources . 
  the goal is a circular economy , not brushing all our defects under the carpet . 
   humanity is managing rather than recycling most of its waste . 
  humanity is not an example , the front runners are . 
  and those front runners are recycling most of their waste , not managing it . 
  the goal is a circular economy . 
   well yes the most realistic way to store energy right now is pumped storage , the vast majority of energy storage is just that . 
  its still really expensive , there 's very little capacity compared to our usage and its geographically limited .
