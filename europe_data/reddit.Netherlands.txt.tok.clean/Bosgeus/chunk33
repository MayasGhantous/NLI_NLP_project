  it would be nice to see a developed state join for once . 
  one that does n't require billions of euro 's to develop , or will have tens/hundreds of thousands emigrate . 
  misleading title , the resolution is not binding and it 's up to the government what to do with it . 
  therefor we did n't ban weapon sales . 
  besides , for years we 've had a ` restrictive ' arms export policy to saudi arabia due to their incredibly poor track record regarding human rights . 
  the republic of cyprus is greek , so it 's european culturally and linguestically . 
  southern dutch = flemish . 
  at least the way i meant it , it refered to the language boundaries , not state borders . 
  here let [ me ] ( http://www.vlaamswoordenboek.be/definities/term/poepen ) teach [ you ] ( http://www.woorden.org/woord/poepen ) something . 
  it wo n't disappear , it will never disappear , it just wo n't bother or harm anyone that way . 
  i do n't know about how common the usage of the word is , and in what regions exactly , but it 's [ true ] ( http://www.vlaamswoordenboek.be/definities/term/poepen ) . 
  i just saw a funny addition , apparently ` poepvet ' ( crap grease ) means [ sperm . 
  ] ( http://www.vlaamswoordenboek.be/definities/term/poepvet ), 
  no , no , belgium should give flanders back to us . 
  fighting racism inherently leads to this kind of thinking . 
  which is why racists are best ignored , not fought against . 
  i was not aware you had limited eyesight , my apologies , try using a different scaling in windows or use ctrl + scroll to enlarge the letters . 
  hope it helps . 
  almost there , if you would 've finished reading the sentence you would n't have to make this reply . 
  well the southern dutch word for intercourse is ` poepen ' , which means ` crapping ' / ` pooing ' in central/northern dutch . 
  in the north/central intercourse is just ` sex ' . 
  so when a belgian goes to spend a night with his so he/she says , to the ears of a dutch person , ` let 's go crap together ' . 
  i gues the limburgers are just too belgianized , it must be noted that limburg was the latest region to join the netherlands ( except the german post-ww2 annexed regions ) maybe this is an explanation ? 
  and if not at least it 's a fun fact  . 
   ... swedish ... hmm ? 
   how about an emergency move to a cashless society during a time when banks are discussing negative interest rates on savings ? 
  no thanks , i 'll rather keep cash so i can take it of the bank when they start to charge negative interest rates . 
  i do n't know , one thing he 's right about is the amount of propaganda . 
  it 's impossible to tell right from wrong in modern western media , especially and particularly when it 's about russia . 
  they all lie through their teeth , our national broadcaster , also the largest news broadcaster in the netherlands ( nos ) , was even caught manufacturing footage of putin . 
  through all this i do n't know what or who i can believe , so i 'll just put it simply , people probably died during strikes , that 's what happens in a war unfortunately . 
  just as people died by western strikes . 
  these people however were not targets , and all parties will have tried to avoid making them casualties . 
  i would n't . 
  i do n't think they even happen at all anymore ( at least here ) as i said atm heists are the thing now , banks do n't have a lot of cash/valuables in faults and the cash that 's there probably is n't accessible by the employees . 
  apart from atm 's jewelry robberies are kind of a thing these days , but they 're primarily the work of ` certain demographics ' , a maroccan even died last year when he robbed a jewelry that had a gun . 
   i 'd actually respect them if they just admitted to accidental collateral damage . 
  he did n't deny that , the title and article are just sensationalist . 
  what he said is ;  alexander yakovenko maintained the jets had `` never targeted '' civilians and had actually `` destroyed the infrastructure which supported isis '' . 
  and ;  cn : are you saying not a single civilian has been killed in this entire five month campaign ? 
   ay : not to my knowledge . 
  [ . . ] he 's not denying that civilians might have died , what he 's saying is that they were n't targeted , and that he does n't know about any civilian casualties . 
  ( which does n't sound surprising given he 's ambassador to the uk ), 
  ` just not bothering ' is closer to intentionally killing than unintentionally . 
  weapons export relative to gdp of the us is higher than france . 
  you 're right on russia and sweden though . 
  i think you 've seen too many western movies . 
  bank robberies are very rare , if they even happen at all . 
  what 's more common is atm heists with explosives or cars . 
  i 'm sorry , but when you plan on killing infidels because you feel obligated by your religion to do so you 're not dutch in any meaningful sense of the word . 
  it takes more to be dutch than to hold a dutch passport . 
  it does n't matter where you are born , wether you 're brown , black , yellow , or white , what does matter is wether you 're ` part of the group ' , integrated , proficient in the language , and share the common values . 
  the same shisha lounge where they recently found a body in the basement . 
  i think it 's closed now . 
  relocation is not going to happen . 
  at least not in the sense of the eu , maybe germany will take them voluntarily . 
  i gues a fiesta st is a reasonable option if you 're looking for performance . 
  though the 2016 focus rs has a g - energy label . 
  you generally ca n't lease that ( unless you 're really high up in which case you wo n't be driving a ford ) and 50 % of new car sales are lease , and a large part of that other 50 % that is n't are those really compact-compact tuna cans like peugeot 107 , citro\u00ebn c1 , toyota aygo etc. 
   but for $ 20k that 's a bargain , the focus st basic price is $ 50.000 , - here . 
  people do n't care a lot about speed and horsepower here , especially if you 're leasing you will pay double monthly fees for the same car with a stronger engine , and even then you can only lease cars with environment label d or better , or even only with an a label ( depending on your function in the company ) just your average 1-1 .4 liter mill will be most popular in compact car sales . 
  i gues it 's when it becomes 3 cilinders that some people become weary due to the vibrations ( especially with lighter cars/thinner plate work ) besides even driving a shelby gt350 you would have to be a millionaire , not even because of the fuel and road taxes , but because of every speed camera around the corner that will charge you 35 euro 's for driving 52 where 50 is the limit . 
  ( i wish that 's a joke but no , talking to an experienced 2km/h fine recipant here ) and as a motorcyclist i 'm aware how difficult it is to keep a fast vehicle on certain speeds . 
  my ducati just wo n't cut it , i feel like a parkinsons patient whenever i 'm trying to do 80 . 
  or be so extreme that he makes fn look like the reasonable ones , increasing their votes . 
  i think we 've found our solution , keep them in greece . 
  if we keep that up long enough they 'll eventually stop coming , and then it 's just a matter of seeking a solution for the people stranded in greece that have n't yet returned to turkey/their countries on their own account . 
  i 'm not really a ford fan , especially not their newer ones , and quality wise they 're debatable . 
  there are plenty of good looking compact cars that are non-german though . 
  your rental company probably had the more economical models , deawoo 's and suzuki 's are popular rental cars , they have a high function-above-form spirit . 
  but think about the honda [ civic ] ( http://autoguide.com.vsassets.com/blog/wp-content/gallery/honda-civic-hatchback/honda-civic-hatchback-4.jpg ) for example , or the renault [ megane ] ( http://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/2016-renault-megane-coup-rendered_1.jpg ) , volvo [ c30 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/volvo_c30_rdesign_hres.jpg ) or hyundai [ veloster ] ( http://cdn.boldride.com/hyundai/2014/hyundai-veloster-reflex.2000x1333.feb-07-2014_12.56.15.454555.jpg ) , or renault [ twizy ] ( http://www.topgear.nl/image/popup/renault-twizy-80-technic-full-11062012093016-9474.jpg ) ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  refugee camps in greece are only filled to roughly 50 % of their capacity . 
  if they were hungry , they would go to the camps . 
  not everyone drives bmw/mercedes , but there 's also the japanese and the italians and the french who have alternatives . 
  they 've leverage now , with the balkan route closed the migrant crisis is now a problem of greece and turkey . 
  time for europe to play hard ball with turkey as well . 
  did ... did you just imply british beer is good ? 
  the horror . 
  electronics ; radar , sensors , sonar etc. 
  ( formerly holland signaal , now thales netherlands ) , and ships ( damen schelde group ; anything from coast guard cutters to frigates ) , vehicles ( daf ) , weaponsystems ( like goalkeeper ) as well as just general parts ( stork , fokker etc. ), 
  for airplanes , vehicles and ships . 
  correct , it would limit their suppliers substantially though consequently also their competition resulting in more expensive equipment , not even mentioning it might serve as an example to other western countries as well if the eu does it . 
   no idea why turkish newspapers are trying to portray them as refugees . 
  daily sabah is the propaganda mouthpiece of sultan erdogan . 
  as much as i agree with the stance , this should be done by the eu , not us . 
  we would merely be bringing business to france , the uk and germany . 
  saudi arabia will just need to pick a new supplier of which there are enough . 
  i think it had something to do with tuition fees , he promised to lower them while he helped increase them . 
  ( or something like that ), 
  refugees = roma now ? 
  my god , we 've more refugees than i knew . 
  if you move the immigrants to a different school , than the pupils of that school will have to be moved again . 
  that 's an endless circle , better to segregate schools , many people wanted to have this kind of society , but that does n't mean our children should suffer the consequences at a very young age . 
  of course the children will be faced with this society more so than the creators of it , but at least let them face it when they 're adults so that they have a solid basis and can choose for themselves wether they want to be part of this society or emigrate . 
  at least then they 'll have a solid educaitonal basis to build a life somewhere else . 
  maybe the parents should remove that 5 % from this school and move them to a different school . 
  the only presence of them in turkey is being a statistic , in reality the majority of claimed refugees have left turkey a while ago . 
   they are not ruled by another country . 
  make that the cat wise . 
   turkey recognises kktc as a sovereign state with its own parliament and organs .
