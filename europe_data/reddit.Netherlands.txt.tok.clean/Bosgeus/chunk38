  parliament can vote against the outcome then , but it 's unclear wether there 's a majority for that . 
  it could also lead to a fracture in the coalition . 
  the liberals will ignore the outcome , labour probably not . 
  ( after all it 's mostly their voters voting against , and their polls are horrible already ), 
  actually the outcome does , pretty confident a majority does n't want another beggar state and future source of immigration to join the eu or aspire towards joining . 
  pretty sure a majority would 've said the same had they asked us with the other eastern members ( romania , poland , bulgaria etc. ), 
  as well . 
  as far as the trade argument goes , let 's settle that [ in advance .

  it actually made me quite proud that our pm often takes a bicycle to work . 
  i find this proposal digusting and outrageous , if they want to travel luxurious they have a salary , from that they can buy any car they want/afford and pay for their own expenses like normal people do . 
  could 've been an oscar ii as well , but it could 've been a nato submarine as well indeed . 
   or you just send a basic message as a minimal courtesy communication . 
  you do n't do that if you do n't have to , it would be an open invitation for nato intelligence . 
  for the whole year .

  solved for the turks , not the cypriots . 
   but by that time over 250,000 had already arrived in 2015 alone . 
  she was simply responding to events that had already transpired . 
  if that number is true , then about 750.000 arrived after her speech until new year . 
  you 're only proving his argument . 
  he is still continuing it though . 
  russia returned ( most of ) the ships though . 
   on 8 april 2014 an agreement was reached between russia and ukraine to return captured vessels to ukraine and `` for the withdrawal of an undisclosed number of ukrainian aircraft seized in crimea '' . 
  [ 28 ] at the time russian navy sources claimed the ukrainian ships were `` not operational because they are old , obsolete , and in poor condition '' . 
  [ 28 ] russia returned 35 ships but unilateral suspended the return ukrainian navy materials from crimea to ukraine proper because/after ukraine did not renew its unilaterally declared ceasefire on 1 july 2014 in the war in donbass . 
  [ 29 ] [ 30 ] 16 ships are hence yet to return to ukraine proper . 
  no , it 's a 1940s poster . 
  it says ` holland and dutch indies ( indonesia ) belong to each other . 
  what is centuries connected , will not be separated by ` the jap ' ( a derogatory term for japanese ), 
  it means ` belonging to ' in this context . 
  it 's old grammar , it would be ` horen ' now . 
  attacking a small vessel eliminates the advantage russia has , they 'll probably come in hard , wide and fast .

  it is simply true though , you 'll need currency for international trade , but money gets less important as everything inside the borders gets nationalized/mobilized . 
  that goes for both sides though . 
  nato uses a standard definition , pension payments are included in both the greek as well as turkish numbers . 
   pension payments made directly by the government to retired military and civilian employees of military departments should be included even if these payments are made from other ministries ' budgets . 
  top 7 origins of non-eu migrants in italy for some context ; * morocco 525.000 * albania 503.000 * china 321.000 * ukraine 234.000 * philipines 166.000 * india 160.000 * moldova 150.000 [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_italy ), 
  i just used it for the budgets , if you have more substantial or equalized numbers for military budgets do share them . 
  according to nato greek defense expenditures over 2015 was 4,8 billion dollar , and turkish defense expenditures 11,9 billion .

  national debt is even less relevant . 
   besides , there is no quantitative measurement that could determine victory there is n't , but there are better and more substantial metrics that can determine the odds . 
  being called racist , losing the moral high ground , see a decline in international karma points , fail in moral imperialism , being seen as normal and not as high school edgy progressives ^ ^ tm something like that . 
  i do n't think so , if you 're going for total war money is n't really important . 
  what 's important is having weapon caches , trained reserve personnel and the ability to mobilize quickly . 
  commercial vessels , trucks etc. 
  are important because they 'll be compounded ( war is a matter of logistics ) domestic industry is important ( can you supply your own fuel ? 
  your own bullets , food , tires , parts etc. ? ), 
  greece has both a military trained young adult population ( they have military conscription ) as well as a very large active reserve personnel force ( about 200.000 ) . 
  they also have large amounts of weapon systems the likes we ( netherlands ) for example have n't seen in decades . 
  they can absolutely fight a very brutal war . 
  can they beat the turks ? 
  probably not , but the turks ca n't vice versa either . 
  actually the greeks spend 4,8 billion dollars in 2015 and the turks 11,9 billion dollars . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_01/20160129_160128-pr-2016-11-eng.pdf#page=2 ) regardless comparing military budgets is not all that accurate because we do n't fight with dollars but with weapons , and people operating weapons . 
  edit ; other source, 
  because the eu is too afraid and weak to protect the greek border their only option is to let turkey come up with a solution the turks helped create in the first place . 
  if you say that , war only becomes more likely . 
  perhaps , the greek and turkish military are well matched though . 
  often underestimated , greece has the 3th largest army in nato if you include reserve personnel and one of the most powerful military forces in the eu . 
   that 's like ... the opposite objective  <  not at all , the last time the dutch tried a surprise re-anschluss the french threw soot in the food , this time that should be prevented . 
   and history had shown it is not difficult to surprise attack the french : / true , just let the battle commense shortly after dinner time , the french will be so drunk they 'll probably drift into germany and the north sea . 
  you were only given one choice , i bet that 's a hard one for a cypriot . 
  which do you want ; * republic of southern cyprus * un dmz * dhekelia * akrotiri * turkey, 
  no we should buy some challenger 2 's instead , they come with build in tea facilities , we would only need to paint them orange . 
  you sure ? 
  if you do tihange as well you may able to surprise attack the french . 
  obviously you ca n't form an anglo-dutch empire and march through europe with borrowed tanks from germany . 
  what do you think we are , greece ? 
  i think those microwave weapons are more effective . 
  or we can pull a frigate ashore and tow it over the highway . 
  we might not have a tank left , but an amphibious frigate should do the same trick . 
  they ca n't move though , and can only be detonated inside belgium . 
  but finland has them now . 
  yea no , keep it at austria and france . 
  you know there are certain circumstances under which we can fortify those borders together < 3 . 
  no more neutrality then , i promise . 
  they talk like a belgian being strangled . 
  they may have their bicycles , and be even lower than the netherlands , but this is not enough to offset that . 
  uhm , yes , absolutely . 
  if they stay on hunger strike long enough the problem will fix itself though . 
  you mean they have 7 instead of 5 ? 
  actually i can since i commented on the way you phrased it , not what you phrased . 
   it 's not about the content ,, 
   merkel warned she would not leave brussels until she got a deal . 
  that 's a once in a lifetime opportunity for europe , do n't make a deal , and hold the next meeting in a different city , merkel wo n't be there again . 
  it 's not about the content , it 's the obnoxious political attitude that goes with it . 
  ` we must do as i say , we ca n't do anything different ' .
