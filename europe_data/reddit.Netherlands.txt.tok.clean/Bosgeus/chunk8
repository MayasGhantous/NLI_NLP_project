  it 's ridiculous to bother all parents with this . 
  if some person really struggles with their gender , parents and teachers will notice it and can take due action . 
  the other 99 % should n't be bothered with this , especially not with such a loaded question of what the ` gender identity ' of a 4 year old is . 
  ` oh he sometimes likes to play with dolls as well , maybe he identifies with both genders ? ', 
  i 'll give you on a letter this is the sort of train of thought you 'll get , and the train of thought mentally healthy children should n't be unnecessarily suscepted to if we do n't want to raise a generation of sexually and mentally confused young adults . 
  to import large amounts of poor , uneducated people from the mena region . 
   the survivors included somalis , ethiopians , egyptians and sudanese . 
  fleeing war i see . 
  the question is put forward to all parents . 
  it does yes , but people wanted this so it 's probably a good idea to make it as bearable as possible . 
   it 's only decriminalization , not legalization that 's basically the dutch take as well . 
  it 's not legal , but simply not criminalized . 
   it 's a matter of effort . 
  and that 's where it failed . 
   we should not reward those who somehow fail to put in the effort . 
  and that 's exactly what we 've been doing . 
  and now after 50 years of doing that we have parallel societies ready to take up new-comers ensuring they do not need to put much effort into it all . 
  those who need it can step forward themselves , no need to burden the vast majority who do not need it . 
  correct , and that 's been a thorn in our side for a while . 
  the electorate wants to legalize it ( there 's no good argument against it really ) , but our minister of justice has known people that died because of weed and hash . 
  however the previous one did n't know any such cases , but he did n't want it either . 
  though it 's getting more momentum with the recent legal case of a weed producer who tried to do everything by the book . 
  the judge set a precedent that by attempting to do everything legal , you will not get further prosecuted . 
  we do have coffeeshops and zones where you are allowed to publicly smoke . 
  the problem is that police mostly lack the tools to check for other substances than alcohol . 
  and the mobile tools available for checking thc for example are usually too inaccurate . 
  ( so inaccurate that they 're mostly banned from use by police force ), 
  depends on what you mean by ` drunk ' . 
  drunk as in ` i 'm intoxicated drunk ' or drunk as in ` i 've passed the legal 0,5 promilage and am too drunk to drive . ', 
  cause after two or three beers i have passed the legal alcohol limit , but would certainly be a lot safer to cycle than when i would be when high . 
   there exist children who have a strong gender identity that does n't match their body , even when their parents try to make them conform . 
  they maintain that identity into adulthood . 
   there also exist children who have a strong variant of leukemia . 
  does n't mean we should give chemo treatment to every 4 year old . 
  i do when they 've major issues learning the language . 
  in many cases they never get proficient in the langauge , even after multiple generations . 
   a four year old is not some sexually or gender confused 20ies regressive liberal . 
  they will be if you abuse them like this . 
  because not every language will be spoken by a quarter of our population in the future , or half . 
  montenegro 's independence never made sense to me , so in that i agree with you . 
  then again , it 's their call . 
  at current growth rates that will take around 25 years , quite some time . 
  never heard that , but we do prefer english over german . 
  frisians generally speak/write excellent dutch , they 're bilingual . 
  i 'm guessing by the numbers it 's mostly second/third generation turks/moroccans . 
  immigratrion policies of former and current government . 
  this is as accurate as ut 's going to be , it 's pretty precise . 
  spanish or mandarin serves no purpose . 
  when in the future an increasingly large part of our citizens is of arabic descent it makes no sense to remain monolingual with all the issues that brings . 
   actually they didnt break the law , they did break the law , it was already mentioned in one of my replies here . 
   they just need to acknowledge the referendum and put the subject to review jea no , please read something about the subject before making bold claims . 
  in the future that might be necessary , or at least a bilingual state in both arabic and dutch . 
  for now it 's too early . 
  i really hope that does not get introduced at all for a long time . 
   i asume among those people are many from eu countries - that work and live in netherlands - probably few hundred thousands of people from eu countries . 
   more non-eu migrants probably . 
  even many second and third generation immigrants from marocco and turkey ( the largest immigrant groups in the netherlands ) speak dutch as if they arrived here yesterday . 
  we passed the 17 million just recently . 
  we 're at 17.006.958 currently to be precise . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/visualisaties/bevolkingsteller ), 
  and montenegro apparently never gained independence . 
  i for one welcome our new crown dependency . 
  if they only elect some less corrupt leaders than their fellow royal subjects in the caribbean , it should be fine . 
  i do n't know what book you 've been reading , but the dutch military campaign was a success . 
  in 9 days the belgian army was basically defeated , it was only then when they asked the french for assistance that we decided to withdraw , avoiding combat with france . 
  not much though , and it has served most of its use as well with the eu now doing the same things . 
   and there is no evidence that the belgian independence movement really was ` fostered ` by foreign powers . 
  it was however protected by the french . 
  due to the french the dutch army could not ` restore order ' . 
  i do n't think europe is in need of even more states . 
  ( less would probably be better ) but yes , ultimately people should decide for themselves . 
  though i 'm not sure the catalans actually want that , and right now is a pretty bad timing to hold one . 
  which is also not what was discussed . 
  the point is the thing you missed ;  there are ways to respect the outcome , ** and also respect our partners . 
  i doubt the netherlands has put thousands of people to work for this treaty . 
  regardless , sunk costs are something to consider but not something to be led by . 
   the supposed airspace violations occur in a made up area which only greece recognizes as their airspace . 
  nonsense , oinousses is not disputed . 
  airspace and maritime border violations of turkey happen in non-disputed area 's as well . 
   were n't you guys up in arms when turkey shot down the russian jet for legitimately violating its airspace ? 
  what are these double standards . 
  turkey violated greek airspace 2244 times in one year ( 2014 ) , i believe action is warranted here . 
  russia only violated turkish airspace a handful of times , and this while doing military operations . 
  both can not be compared . 
  the plans are to never allow such a thing . 
  and it would have no point either , the two referendums we had were completely ignored , even if we would have a referendum the outcome would be something our government wipes their bottom with . 
  the only rational explanation for erdogans ' foreign policy would be that ` turkey ' is turkish for ` enemy of everybody else ' . 
  never found that translation in a dictionary though . 
  regardless , it 's quite telling how few friends ( if any - maybe azerbijan ) the turks have , and how many enemies they 've made in their direct vicinity . 
  ( cyprus , greece , russia , armenia , syria ), 
   anyway i understand it , it is the nation which holds the power in a country not politicians . 
  well in any case the power is regulated by law . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://wetten.overheid.nl/bwbr0036443/2015-07-01 ) -------------  article 11 if there is irrevocably determined that a referendum has led to an advisory outcome of rejection , a proposal will be drafted ** as soon as possible ** which ** exclusively aims to reject ** the law . 
  the cabinet chose to ignore this completely . 
   on the other hand , remember that it is you who elected your politicians , you ca n't put the blame on eu for this . 
  i blame the eu for being a vessel of these kind of practices , and preventing us from holding our own politicians accountible . 
  this is actually pretty bad , as it undermines trust in europe even more , and breeds even more resentment . 
  regardless if you 're for or against the treaty , everybody should respect the rule of law and democracy . 
  this referendum should not stop poland from being a friend to ukraine and helping , it should stop us though , or at the very least the legal procedure should 've been followed . 
  there are ways to respect the outcome , and also respect our partners .
