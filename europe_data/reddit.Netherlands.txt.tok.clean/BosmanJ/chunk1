i 'm pretty passionate about stroopwafels and bitterballen . . ok maybe we dutch people are n't the most passionate , i just realized . 
  as usual , we dutchies can [ actually ] ( http://www.pandion.nl/pages/te%20koop/%c2%a9pandion_veluwe_04935.jpg ) [ beat ] ( http://veluwe.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/gb_2007-07-07_0077.jpg ) [ you ] ( http://veluwe.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/kootwijkerzand.jpg ) . 
  we have [ forest fires ] ( https://www.nieuws.nl/media/p0u3wrscpxuwcsu1grjb0t055-w620-h352-q90-f-bececed/bosbrand-1.jpg ) too !, 
  i have to say schwarzw\u00e4lder kirschtorte is one of the best pastries i 've eaten in my entire life . 
  kaiserschmarren is the best , also apfelstr\u00fcdel in vanillasauce and sp\u00e4tzle . 
  different versions are also named * apple spheres * , * raisin spheres * , * pineapple spheres * , etc. 
  take that * zuiderburen * !, 
  i thought that was a circlejerk sub . 
  no joke . 
  definitely my favorite . 
  the color of the building in that ` garden ' like environment do it for me . 
  i do n't know . 
  i have n't heard a supermodel complain yet . 
  meanwhile the netherlands are in crisis ( well not really a crisis , but it 's a really highly debated topic around here ) . 
  i guess it 's that old * handelsgeest * ( trading nature ) dutch people have . 
  we also have that double bus thing in utrecht , the netherlands . 
  they drive from the central station to the uithof , which is an office area where the hogeschool utrecht and university of utrecht are located . 
  busiest , buses . 
  ever . 
  belgium is just a name we gave our defected provinces . 
  i think it was worse in the west . 
  there 's a lot of water in the streets but you can still avoid touching it . 
  the worst thing out here are people 's basements flooding . 
  our * gemeentehuis * is closed i think because the basement were power installations are , is flooded . 
  i myself have no troubles with this storm . 
  it 's also over now . 
  today the water even came from the sky ... 
  jokes aside , i live in the eastern part of the netherlands near a cleaning system thing , so we have delicious drinking water . 
  you can drink all the water around these parts . 
  i am proud of our defected provinces !, 
  jokes aside , i would definitely want to see this some more !, 
  i have even read `` leftist liberal '' for d66 . 
  hahahaha , i would n't say that , but they 're quite moderate , yes . 
   could you tell me about one point on which they completly disagree ? 
  during the recession the vvd wanted to cut a lot in culture , healthcare and education . 
  especially the latter does n't go for d66 . 
  d66 always wanted to invest , look to the future instead of the now . 
  kind of has a charm to it to say the least . 
  i think i made the right voting choice today ( 76,6 % ) . 
   partij van de arbeid ( extreme left wing ) as someone from the netherlands i could n't help but chuckle . 
  wait , that stuff in the plastic bags is supposed to be cannabis ? 
  wow , you wont get any shittier quality than that . . 
  well , they at least have 2 votes !, 
   i was going to vote socialist ( as i consider myself a socialist ) , but their point of view towards the eu really sucks . 
  groenlinks it is then !, 
  wrong mate : gelderland  utrecht  noord brabant  holland  friesland  limburg  fake brabant, 
  oh i know , but at least a quarter of your country is more rural ( compared to only southern limburg and the veluwe ) . 
  i guess that 's not the * only * explanation , but i think it does matter somewhat . 
  sound carries very very far when there 's no hills and only highways . 
  anyway , the cities are * always * noisy . 
  i live in one of the quiter parts of the netherlands , but there 's so much highways etc. 
  you always hear them . 
  the bigger cities are filled with life all the time . 
  most parts of the country just are n't quiet at all . 
  and you think the average dutch person is interested in our trade policy etc ? 
  i agree that there are waaaay more benefits in being part of the eu than costs . 
  most dutch people tend to have something we call an ` onderbuikgevoel ' , which basically means : they think it 's bad because they have the feeling it makes everything worse . 
  it 's the most illogical argument out there , but a lot of people tend to follow their onderbuikgevoel . 
  anti-eu sentiment is pretty big in the netherlands . 
  france has ratatouille , one of the finest recipes in my opinion . 
  the italians have cannelloni , really delicious . 
  but when i 'm going to austria next week , i 'm going to eat a lot of apfelstr\u00fcdel and all kinds of schnitzels , i ca n't wait , 
   great highway network leading to any direction and there we dutchmen are joking about the poor state of belgian roads . 
  you sound like our prime minister : `` there 's no poverty in the netherlands '' , which is complete bullshit . 
  then again , social class is a better predictor , people in lower social classes tend to be more criminal . 
  most lower class people around here are immigrants . 
  why do n't we also kick out [ the french ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balthasar_g%c3%a9rard ) for that matter ? 
  well , as theo maassen once said : `` i was in hell once , it was called almere . '', 
  although i do n't want to defend russia or anything . 
  but a tweet like that is an equally bad source as the russian news . 
  there 's a large ` russian population ' on the crimea though , so it would n't be surprising right ? 
  you mean ancient greek colonists . 
  god this picture hits me hard . 
  i can not even imagine the pain this man must be in . 
  implying that either north korea or venezuela are * true socialist * states . 
  you have me , and i 'm not even irish !, 
  i 'm not really well informed , but is the ukrainian military involved during the conflicts ? 
  it seems like a really bad idea to storm a military base if they are n't . 
  and i believe they are n't because of international law . 
  i do n't know that much about italy , but i 'm guessing northern italy near milan or turin ? 
  that weather though . 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  i do n't know anything about armenia , but it 's cool to know something about your roots . 
  what about the [ posbank ? 
  ] ( http://static.nationalgeographic.nl/pictures/genjuserphotopicture/original/37/03/40/zonsopkomst-posbank-400337.jpg ) or [ kootwijkerzand ? 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jhyr7ujblya/txc37ky3chi/aaaaaaaaa1g/fjhljgkabro/s1600/kootwijkerzand%2b6.jpg ) the veluwe is absolutely beautiful . 
  * arnhem : think they 're better than nijmegen . 
  lots of diverse people . 
  * nijmegen : think they 're better than arnhem . 
  they also have a funny accent . 
  * utrecht ( city ) : seems to be mecca for students . 
  * utrechtse heuvelrug and the veluwe : quite religious , though not as outgoing as staphorst or urk . 
  * ' t gooi : people with way to much money . 
  let 's see what i can do !, 
  light blue with horizontal black lines , light blue with vertical black lines , blue and white with horizontal red lines . 
   1968 : ( . . ) there was also a rumor that one night a couple had sex inside the goat . 
  agreed , heck i even spelled bucharest and copenhagen wrong . . 
  arnhem-nijmegen is such an underrated part of this little country . 
  just north of arnhem , there 's the veluwe , the largest forested area in the netherlands , with the hoge veluwe ( high veluwe ) in it , which is our largest national park . 
  it 's definitely worth taking a walk through both .
