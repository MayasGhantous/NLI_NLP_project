  i should also recommend the utrechtse heuvelrug ( utrecht hillridge ) as a nice place to bike . 
  hey my hometown is mentioned on reddit . 
  [ paleis het loo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/het_loo_palace ) is also quite a nice place around here ( apeldoorn ) . 
  it 's called * little versailles * because the architecture and the garden resemble versailles . 
  you should go grab a beer in utrecht as well . 
  it 's a major dutch town full of students , and one of the best places to be , in my opinion . 
  everyone 's just so ` open ' around there . 
  [ yup . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoza1velioi ), 
  that first one is a * harsh g * overkill in dutch ( note that * ch * is a * harsh g * as well !, 
  a lot of dutch people are scary nationalistic , and most of them do n't even have a reason for being nationalistic or even xenophobic . 
  last week i heard ` well , people of foreign descent often do n't work hard or not at all ' as an argument . 
  the support for the pvv is getting crazy scary . 
  * croque monsieur !, 
  it gets worse every year though . 
  sinterklaas is an old dutch tradition , comparable with christmas in a lot of other countries . 
  santa claus is based on sinterklaas and he gives children gifts on december 5th . 
  he has a lot of helpers to do this , they 're called ` zwarte pieten ' ( black petes ) . 
  some people think zwarte piet refers to slavery and colonialism and this think it 's racist . 
  there are also people who think it 's racist when white people paint themselves black . 
  this has sparked a discussion and now even the united nations are looking into it . 
  i ca n't believe sem , lucas , levi and jayden are * that * popular . 
  then again , people these days want to give their children unique names . 
  which leads to this paradox i guess ? 
  i 'm not buying this ... 
  yes , the * freedom party * is growing quickly , quite scary how people can follow one right-wing extremist so easily . 
  reykjavik seems to have a pretty cool major . 
  oh and beautiful landscapes !, 
   the netherlands does one area with mountains in the far south . 
  we call them * bergen * , mountains , in the netherlands , but in fact they 're only about 300 metres above sea level . 
  ** hertog jan ** !, 
  [ yeah french music !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rriorhf3uus ), 
  dutch frikadellen are best frikadellen !, 
  it 's widely considered to be * the east * , because it lines up well with cities like deventer ( thus overijssel ) and zutphen ( the achterhoek ) . 
  geographically it 's rather close to the center , 20 minutes from amersfoort and 30 minutes to ede . 
  apeldoorn 's a nice place to live by the way , but i 'd rather live in haarlem !, 
  yeah , i live in apeldoorn , study in utrecht and had some friends around veenendaal , so yeah , basically the heart of the netherlands . 
  actually it 's from my grandmothers side . 
  her surname is navasard , which derives from the last name navasardian and that 's a common surname in armenia . 
   lukashenko is quite an autoritarian prime minister . 
  is n't he considered to be the last european dictator ? 
  i am of armenian descent too !, 
  hooray !, 
  wow , i missed that one word . 
  my bad . 
  wait . . 
  there 's an embassy in that place ? 
  i walk there like five times a day and i did n't notice it ... 
  what are you talking about ? 
  frisian girls are * hot * !, 
  but not as hot as over here , right at the heart of the netherlands !, 
  i think the * politionele acties * are the most shameful moment . 
  the actions were bad , but not worse than slavery . 
  what i think is the most shameful about these actions , is the fact ` we ' fought for independence from nazi-germany ( or at least not being a puppet state ) . 
  we though everyone should have the right to be free etc. 
  but when the indonesian people asked for their independence , we started raiding their villages and let them fight each other . 
  wow , with these battle results you 'd almost think they were playing a video game like empire total war . 
  i think the fact we conquered the sea is one of our greatest achievements . 
  we created a whole province out of water , a whole country to be precise . 
  one of our largest export products is our knowledge on water . 
  we build harbors and dykes all over the world and we dig canals with the knowledge we have . 
  heck , at times it was even our defensive system : flooding the country to keep invaders out . 
  without the water , we would n't be who we are . 
  the rest of what i listed , is cool but indeed nothing to be proud off . 
  we built dykes and found a way to create dry land were water was , * ` droogleggen ' * . 
  after 1953 we built the huge structures called [ deltawerken ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delta_works ) , which would protect certain vulnerable parts of the netherlands from floods . 
  * we funded the city which can now be considered one of the greatest cities ever : new york ( or new amsterdam as it was called back then ) . 
  and we found the cape colony , which eventually became south africa . 
  afrikaans is still a language derived from dutch and the * boer people * are farmers of dutch ancestry . 
  we also discovered australia and called it new holland , until the english came and claimed it . 
  edit : bonus points for : * conquering england during the glorious revolution . 
  * capturing a spannish treasure fleet . 
  [ piet hein ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_in_the_bay_of_matanzas ) is considered a national hero ( overrated , but anyway cool ) for capturing the fleet , the treasure 's worth is probably around 11 milion guilders . 
  * creating the first joint-stock company , known as the voc ( vereenigde oost-indische compagnie ) . 
  edit ii : * ending 1st in the 2011 baseball world cup . 
  no dude , totally wrong . 
  most muslims are quite peaceful ( yes i can relate , at my school about 40 % of students is muslim and in that town , 200,000 out of 300,000 utrechters are of non-western descent ) . 
  there are a few rotten apples between them though , and i do n't agree with the teachings of the qur ` an . 
  but they are generally peaceful people and you ca n't deny that . 
  true , but sometimes they are referred to as * negro\u00efde * , or at least i 've seen that occasionally . 
  indeed it is n't . 
  and most media say * van allochtone afkomst * or * of foreign descent * . 
  i 'd say germany . 
  kind of american like malls ( like centr-o ) which are pretty neat !, 
  yeah they are , i 'm from a dutch-indonesian family ( indo 's ) so we all are terribly short . 
  i always look up to everyone :(, 
  meh kinda , at the same time people here envy countries like norway switzerland and even germany , but at the same time a lot of dutch people feel superior to others . 
  after that invade europe and listen to the 1812 ouverture non stop !, 
  i think a lot of people here in the netherlands see you guys as our ` big brother ' country . 
  meaning that we always sort of look up to you guys . 
  it was orange untill the french revolution left a trace all over europe . 
  late 1992 2 . 
  someone who dropped out of college , * twice * , but will probably give it a third run . 
  being surrounded by happy people . 
  [ not really ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2044683-vannacht-was-de-warmste-nacht-ooit.html ) . 
  it was just above 24c and it 's a record . 
  remember we 're talking about * at night *, 
  i feel like it would enable a broader set of options . 
  with yes the coming years would all be the same .
