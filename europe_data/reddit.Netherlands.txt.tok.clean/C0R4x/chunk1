putin wishes he was powerful enough to do so . 
  read this in a german accent , 
  make icecream ? 
  i think it is about time to give the dutch people a notice that their country is being moved soon !, 
  i ( as a dutch person ) have n't heard yet , and i think the netherlands being moved would cause great unrest under the dutch people . 
  [ this is mine ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/printablegraph?ec=-6.12&amp;soc=-5.44 ) . 
  i knew i was going to end up in that corner , but this is a bit more extreme than i had guessed . 
  especially when compared to polquiz.com . 
   the us air force plans to temporarily deploy heavy bombers capable of delivering nuclear weapons to europe deliver nuclear weapons to europe ? 
  or deploy heavy bombers to europe ? 
  lel , does it matter whether they are handicapped ? 
  ( sarcasm transoates badly on the internet ) also , afaik , it 's not only handicapped people , but also old people ( iirc , my grandmother used to go on similar boat tours to germany with the same company ), 
  [ video ] ( http://youtu.be/t8q_l31n6ii ) of the beer bottle bombardment . 
  the interviewer has said he will volunteer for a few days for the organisation that organised the boat trip . 
  what is it now ? 
  some kind of red lion ? 
  microsoft translator ? 
  i like it , 
  not sure if i 've ever heard anyone describe dutchies as `` quiet '' though, 
  hahah i 'm just imagining ; boarding the train but not feeling well , go to the toilet for a bit of privacy , maybe you feel you need to puke . 
  once at the toilet , faint . 
  wake up to barking dogs , aggressively shouting men in black with assault rifles stuck in your face :') that would seriously fuck up your day . 
  what the fuck is happening here ? 
  +1 for truth . 
  some benefits i 've found on the website of the dutch government ; * economical growth , so basically more money * more jobs that 's it . 
  then there 's a list of advantages for corporations : * less costs associated with export * smaller businesses are now able to export to the us ( where this was previously too expensive i assume ) * import of products will be cheaper . 
  this means that a lot of goods that are now semi-manufactured on one side and finished on the other side of the ocean would get a lot cheaper . 
  besides that , ttip also promises to make trade easier , for instance by acknowledging american standards ( for instance car safety , where we now ( apparently ) have a separate european and american testing system ) . 
  personally i think that 's one of the few good items on the ttip agenda , it would make development cheaper and less cumbersome . 
  your last two posts have been wholly dedicated to discrediting me , not a single substantive point has been made . 
  what ? 
  are we reading the same article ? 
  the first case concluded that zwarte piet is too offensive , and that therefore the `` permit '' that 's required to keep the sinterklaas intocht in amsterdam needs to be reviewed . 
  the raad van state said that it is not the task of the amsterdam mayor to think about whether something is racist or not , and that the ** permit for the sinterklaas intocht ** was actually valid . 
   its pretty obvious from the whole article that the previous judgement on the ` offensiveness ' of zwarte piet no longer stands . 
  i ` ts pretty obvious that you did not understand the article , since the article ( and the rvs case ) is only about whether the gemeente ( or mayor ) should take racism into consideration when giving out permits for events that take place in the city . 
  recap : the first case concluded zwarte piet is indeed racist , therefore the permit should be rejected , the rvs case said it is not the task of the gemeente/mayor to take racism into account when giving out permits . 
   you choose to only focus on a caricature . 
  yes , because this is the offensive part . 
   its not like white men all feel ashamed around december because santa claus is fat , hohoho and allways weares the same clothes like a bum . 
  this is a comparison that completely misses the point . 
  if fat white men that shout hohoho and wear red and white clothes at one point in history had been considered a type of intelligent monkey , and had been traded and sold like sheep , there is no doubt in my mind that a lot of white men would not like to be reminded of that period every few weeks around christmas time . 
   no it is a caricature that is black . 
  in the fashion a black person would be ridiculed in the 19th century . 
  large golden earrings , fat red lips . 
   i think the notion that pretending to black is a bad thing , might acutally be racist , like there is something wrong with being black . 
  but pretending to be black , i just ca n't see what is wrong with that . 
  i think there is something wrong with dressing up like a caricature designed to ridicule a whole race that were ( at the time ) considered lesser humans . 
   so if someone makes a connection with something in history everybody else has to stop doing what they do , * eventhough nobody thinks it actually has anything to do with it ? 
  * honestly ? 
  how can you argue that his facial features are anything but an 1800s racial caricature ? 
  if you 're using an article to counter my argument , please read the fucking article . 
  fourth line from the top . 
  this, 
  that 's bullshit . 
  zwarte piet is an obvious caricature of a black person . 
  the denial of this is denial of part of our history , and painful to some people . 
  the fact that you ca n't go outside or switch on the tv / radio for three weeks and be confronted with that nation-wide denial makes some people feel like lesser human beings . 
  which is the reason why the judge ruled that zwarte piet is indeed too offensive in it 's current form , and should not be used anymore . 
  which is ( i think ) also the reason why denying the holocaust is forbidden in the netherlands . 
  then again , the reason for zwarte piet being black could be traced back thousands of years , starting with odin 's ( black ) ravens spying on people through their chimneys . 
  a lot of traditions held in that season have historically had black characters . 
  so no wonder that someone writing a new `` tradition '' ( or christmas story , or whatever it was ment to be in the first place ) around that time would have looked at other stories and try to keep in line with the general story line , but give a modern twist to it ( so black slaves and a saint ) . 
  but there is no way of exactly knowing what the motivations were of course . 
  so i personally disagree with the idea that rainbow-colored or clown zwarte pieten would be a good substitute . 
  i feel that if we want to change this tradition , it would make sense to look at the important parts and try to keep those . 
  and i feel that an important part is the black colour . 
  now that does n't necessarily mean blackface ofc . 
  they could also dress up as those zwarte kousen guys from the bible belt , i 'd personally think that that could be fun , 
  can someone explain to me where the anti - caucasus sentiment in russia comes from ? 
   ie if a husband rapes his wife every day for a year , it 's 365 unique cases well he raped her 365 times , so it makes sense , does n't it ? 
   there were some reports they were n't locals either but hooligans from elsewhere , which would be convenient . 
  i believe that in most cases where there are protests against asylum-seeker-camps ( azc ) , the majority of people are not locals but people from various ( extreme - ) rightist groups , with a certain overlap with football hooligans . 
  not only that , many of these people are born and raised here in the west . 
  they do n't have a country they come from , where would you deport them to ? 
   pepper spray / animal spray does serve a valuable purpose to a lot of people , and the action 's of a few should not impede it 's use . 
  i ca n't think of a viable use tbh . 
  but i guess that 's also the reason that pepperspray is illegal in the netherlands . 
  in hdr mode , yes . 
  the post above however talks about a hdr filter . 
  the asphalt surrounding the stylized bike has a different colour , which is what makes it look shopped ( imo ) . 
  it 's probably because the asphalt was cleaned to paint the bike on it , considering it 's a re-purposed airstrip ( and i assume the bike was n't painted on there when it was an actual airstrip  ) edit : in the first pic you added you can see the same outline . 
  a filter that mimics a hdr effect . 
  or join the netherlands again ? 
  i mean , we 've got a king now ... 
  lol, 
  i think i 'm starting to understand where the `` dumb blonde '' stereotype come from ... 
   it would mean our drivers license is discriminatory , even our toilets would be discriminatory , our healthcare would be discriminatory , and what about our labour laws ? 
  all discriminatory . 
  could you expand on these points ? 
   * discrimination on the grounds of religion , belief , political opinion , * ** race ** * or sex or on any other grounds whatsoever shall not be permitted . 
  * being checked because of skin colour is being treated differently . 
  otoh , being checked because you are a man , or you are within the age group of 18-25 is also being treated differently . 
  ( as theo maassen pointed out ), 
   tempering tampering *, 
   they sell everything besides the filet ... because we buy everything besides the rest who are they , and to whom do they sell everything besides the filet ? 
  and what 's everything besides the rest ? 
  and are we talking about chickens bred for egg-laying or chickens bred for the meat ? 
  aye , but i believe the reason for that is that they gladly buy european `` egg chickens '' , that in europe does n't get sold to consumers since we do n't like the taste . 
  so the chickens they buy are essentially a waste product of our egg industry .
