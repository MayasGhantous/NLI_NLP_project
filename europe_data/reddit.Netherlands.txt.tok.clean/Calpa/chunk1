how is grekenland longer than griekenland ? 
  or use better compression algorithms . 
  it would help the proponents so much if they 'd just stopped using big red lips and golden earrings , with their argument that `` they 're just black from all the chimneys ! '', 
  do they share a sense of community to begin with , or are they simply placed in a certain category by the rest and as such generally flock together ? 
  implying that , apart from their strong preference in names , muslims do have a lot in common ? 
  a muslim from indonesia is pretty different from one from iran or turkey . . 
  which is silly ; as if economic growth is the only way to measure progress , and that if the economy happens to shrink everything in between was pointless effort . 
  in the past decade people have grown , got degrees , innovations were started , political changes were made . . never can a decade be truly lost ; perhaps only to a bankers pocket . 
  imho the netherlands simply is one of the best places in the world to * live * because it 's so darn boring ; everything is damn well maintained and organized . 
  sightseeing ? 
  not so much . . but i 'd say the best places in the world in terms of sights are rarely the best places to live . 
  well then ; suck it finland : http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi, 
  many countries do have their own updated version . 
  right , this is not true . 
  doctors are made to swear ` an ' oath , albeit a slightly different version of the original hippocratic oath . 
  google translate :  i / swear promise i as good as i can will exercise the service of my fellow man . 
  medicine i 'll take care of the sick , promote health and alleviate suffering . 
  i suggest the importance of the patient first and respectful attitudes . 
  i will do no harm to the patient . 
  i listen and will inform him well . 
  i will keep secret what has been entrusted to me . 
  i will promote the medical knowledge of myself and others . 
  i recognize the limits of my abilities . 
  i shall draw open and testable , and i know my responsibility to society . 
  i will promote the availability and accessibility of health care . 
  i do not abuse my medical knowledge , even under pressure . 
  i will uphold the medical profession alive . 
  i promise ( so help me god . ), 
  the verse ` do no harm ' is of course not stated so literal that it prevents doctors from doing surgery or any other form of medicine where one would need to ` first cause harm to then cure ' ; it 's harm in the bigger sense .

  actively looking for one particular group of people negates the point of a survey and its statistical validity . 
  you take a random sample , and look how many of them you 've caught . 
  what * denbts * ? 
  the decline in the netherlands was largely attributable to the very soft winter , so compared to previous winters we ( and those we export gas to ) hardly used any gas .

   because it shows that the people believe less in the losing party and more in the winning party . 
  no , fewer people believe in a particular party then they did before - not that people believe less . 
   if a loses voters and b wins voters , it shows that the voters agree more with b than they did before . 
  thus is it shows that the people agreed less with a than they did before . 
  compared to voters a couple of years before , fewer voted for a particular party . 
  but in the end , most people might still agree with that party , it 's just that a large group jumped ship - why should that devalue the vote of those that stayed ? 
   tl ; dr : it 's all fun and games until a far-left or far-right candidate is voted in as a country 's leader in national elections . . then you start seeing those vetos and weird stuff happening . 
  well , in the netherlands the right-wing populist pvv has gone from 0 to 30 ( out of 75 ) in the polls , but in actuality has seen gains and losses the past elections . 
  right now its anti-establishment and anti-eu sentiment is countered by very popular pro-eu liberal democratic party . 
  there 's not really a trend , other than that the popularity of more populist party on both the left and right end of the political spectrum has risen and fallen in the past decade . 
   and as people tend to vote in favor of the status quo it does n't say too much could n't a similar argument be used for more populist parties ; that ` some people are simply easily swayed by anti-establishment parties ' ? 
  but why is the opinion of the people who changed their minds worth more than that of those that voted the same ? 
  should n't party going from 40 to 20 seats be just as legitimate as one going from 5 to 20 ? 
  what does it matter that the first party ` lost ' , when just as many people voted for its platform ? 
  ... so , debate ? 
  for what it 's worth , the dutch press does n't publish names of suspects or victims , and rarely posts photographs of them ( and they are often censored ) , and with court cases only uses drawings of the suspect . 
  i lived a while in the uk and i was shocked by how open they are with publishing information of both victims and suspects . . so in this case ` free press ' does n't mean just publishing every little detail because you can . 
  there are some interesting anomalies that do n't match up with basic density map . 
  look , for instance at lithuania . 
  those were the ` dutch indies ' for quite some time . 
  denmark ; we 'll beat you guys someday !, 
  there is a very nice docu series called [ ` nederland van boven ' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikr-txpihpc ) , and with the aid of a birds eye view it describes the countries history , infrastructure , people , economy etc. 
  well ; the dt-rule is n't really that difficult from a grammatical perspective . 
  what people have more trouble with is when to use ` de ' or ` het ' - * de huis , het winkel , de glas , het wijn * . 
  well , if you want to live in the 4 big cities you wo n't find much suitable below 200.000 . . but since it 's a small country , many people choose for a longer commute and live in smaller towns with relatively cheaper housing .

  well there are a lot of drama shows that are perhaps worth watching : [ overspel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6owf6jkewau ) and [ penoza ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtfm-qywzi ) are recent ones . . for documentaries i 'd advise [ nederland van boven ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcfayekzgds ) , which covers everything about the netherlands as seen from above . . 
  these were just from the top of my head - for more i 'd have to think about it , 
  what kind of tv shows are you looking for ? 
  well ; it 's a stereotype of all dutch people hating germans - which thankfully is n't true ( anymore ) . 
  in soviet russia , joke 's on you !, 
  [ here are some nice statistics on the numerous 100k + dutch cities .

  yeah . . you should just get a 2nd hand bike for around 50 euro 's , which you can just simply sell again when you leave . 
  [ greece ( greek : \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 [ e\u02c8la\u00f0a ] ell\u00e1da ) , officially the hellenic republic ( \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 [ elini\u02c8ci \u00f0imokra\u02c8ti.a ] ell\u012bnik\u012b\u0301 d\u012bmokrat\u00eda ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greece ) . 
  so from `` ell\u00e1da '' . 
  together we could surpass the economies of indonesia , south korea , mexico and spain !, 
  in the netherlands this only happens when you buy a phone on contract ; you do n't have to present an id when buying a pre-paid phone . 
  what about just recreational boats crisscrossing around the isles ? 
   geotagging ( also written as geotagging ) is the process of adding geographical identification metadata to various media such as a geotagged photograph or video , websites , sms messages , qr codes [ 1 ] or rss feeds and is a form of geospatial metadata . 
  this data usually consists of latitude and longitude coordinates , though they can also include altitude , bearing , distance , accuracy data , and place names . 
  every smartphone these days has gps , and most computers can infer a location using ip hosts - twitter simply embeds that in the tweet meta data . 
  boats ? 
  oh , it 's just that there already are so many people ( mostly from the us of course ) that confuse dutch with german and vice versa , that i just had to jump in . . , 
  but using that same logic , current german is a dialect of the original language from the 4th century . 
  ` german dialect ' simply means something else than * late old high german dialect * ; therefore it 's odd to call dutch a ` german ' dialect . 
  it 's a germanic language ; it never was a * german dialect * . 
  but strangely just the dutch speaking park , netherlands and flanders , and not wallonia and luxembourg, 
  and it will probably make the current smartphone plans even more expensive to cover these losses . 
  you mean the homeless people selling newspapers ? 
  they 're not beggars . 
  i 've lived in london ; the amount of beggars there is astonishing . 
  in the netherlands i got a monthly allowance of $ 270 to cover tuition and housing costs ( and i got something extra because my parents were n't earning enough to support me ) , on top of that i could loan extra at a 1 to 2 % interest rate , i received extra compensation from the government for rent ( $ 100 ) , i had a part time job at university ( a day a week , so $ 450 ) , and a small it job ( about $ 600 ) . . all in all i was able to make it on my own as a 20-year-old boy pretty well . . 
  the dutch royal family is making a lot of money due to business deals with , for instance , japan and several middle-eastern states . 
  they 're simply part of our marketing efforts . 
  is n't it up to cyprus whether it accepts the help and accompanying terms and conditions ? 
  the problem is that you do n't bring any real arguments to the table to demonstrate that ` we are all the same ' , whereas i have brought forth plenty of figures and statements to support my claims that some economies are vastly different in he way they are set up , function and can also subsequently fail .
