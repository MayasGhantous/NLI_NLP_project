  ( i mean , you completely ignored my previous post on the economic impact of rotterdam on the dutch economy ) it seems to me you 're the one in denial here ; this need to generalize every country out there . 
  . . how about everything that is * produced * in the netherlands , and subsequently transported . 
  you know the transport companies do n't get a direct share of the stuff they 're transporting ? 
  everything that is manufactured in the netherlands that does not go to the european mainland will pretty much be shipped somewhere via rotterdam . 
  current export numbers are $ 556.5 billion ( 2012 est. 
  ) , mainly machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels ; foodstuffs , with main export partners : germany 25.4 % , belgium 13.7 % , france 8.9 % , united kingdom 8.8 % , italy 5.2 % . 
  a huge portion of that 556 billion will pass through rotterdam . 
   the economy is noted for stable industrial relations , fairly low unemployment and inflation , a sizable current account surplus , and ** an important role as a european transportation hub ** . 
  industrial activity is predominantly in food processing , chemicals , petroleum refining , and electrical machinery . 
  a highly mechanised agricultural sector employs no more than 2 % of the labour force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports . 
  i do n't even know why were discussing this . . one of the key points here is that the dutch ecomomy is different in the way it is set up from that of spain ( and also norway , for that matter ) ; and export ( for which the port of rotterdam is very import ) is a large contributer to dutch economic growth . 
  our entire country is set-up as a transport hub to europe ; from the ports of rotterdam to the high-grade rail and waterways . 
  with the fact that we have an export economy , how do you think that exporting actually takes place in practice ? 
   do not trust germany ( never again & fuck them everywhere if there is a chance ) you 're talking about germany . . the country that is currently carrying the european economy on its shoulders and bailing out the mediterranean countries left , right and center ? 
  even greece , whose leaders royally fucked up their economy and lied about their internal affairs to eu regulators for decades ? 
  you 're talking about * that * germany ? 
   they are just going through the `` netherlands is n't spain '' phase this is just a ridiculous assesment of my argument . 
  indeed , the netherlands is n't spain because of the simple fact that our economies are nothing alike - just like norway 's economy is totally different from the dutch one , as they possess a massive quantity of oil . . or the fact that you ca n't compare germany to cyprus or monaco . 
  you two are just grasping at straws and subsequently act all surprised when you 're not taken seriously . 
  i 've explained in slight detail why our economies differ , yet both your responses come down to `` yes but they are the same ! '' . . 
  no point in arguing . 
  that statement simply does n't mean anything when you 're talking about totally different economies , since the solution to their problems will also be vastly different . 
  the dutch economy is heavily depedant on foreign trade , and as such a global economy that is slumping will also be reflected internally in the netherlands . . however , an increase in export ( for instance when the german industry is doing better ) will improve economic growth . 
  the fact that the source of dutch economic growth is different from that of spain , also means that when it comes to austerity measures and the current european crisis different measures should be taken in order to minimize debt . 
   feeding from the crumbs that fall from the german table does n't strike me as very wise . 
  that 's a very shortsighted way of describing it - but fine , if you want to describe the situation that way to fit your own narrative , go ahead . 
  in reality the dutch economy does n't resemble spains in any way - sure the dutch have issues , but they are vastly different and far less severe . 
   it 's just that holland is about five to ten years behind spain on the trajectory . 
  that hugely depends on what kind of economy you have . . 
  the dutch have a huge export economy due to them having one of the largest ports in the world ; this pretty much allows them to act as a transport hub for not only their own industry , but also germany 's . 
  you can not just compare two countries whithout looking what actually makes up those economies - they differ greatly . 
  compare this :  the netherlands has a prosperous and open economy , which depends heavily on foreign trade . 
  the economy is noted for stable industrial relations , fairly low unemployment and inflation , a sizable current account surplus , and an important role as a european transportation hub . 
  industrial activity is predominantly in food processing , chemicals , petroleum refining , and electrical machinery . 
  a highly mechanised agricultural sector employs no more than 2 % of the labour force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports . 
  the netherlands , along with 11 of its eu partners , began circulating the euro currency on 1 january 2002 . 
  the country is one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment . 
  . . to the fact that the [ rising spanish economy was largely due to the property bubble ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_spain ) . 
  the dutch economy relies mostly on industry ( 24.4 % ) and services ( 73.7 % ) , whereas the spanish economy relies on industry ( 11.7 % ) , construction ( 10.0 % ) and services ( 66.6 % ) . . the difference in reliance on own industry is important here , and also one must not underestimate the benefit of the netherlands in neighbouring germany - as long as they 're still up on their feet , the dutch will do fine . 
  why the ` six biggest ' , and not the six largest economies . . 
  the dutch economy and especially when it comes to the banking industry is much larger than that of poland ; in addition , there 's the [ double irish with a dutch sandwich ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement ) , which a lot of large multinationals use . 
  odd . 
  just flanders , right , 
   in the 16th century the city surpassed bruge to form the virtual hub of the entire international trade economy , surpassing amsterdam with the voc , `` often considered to have been the first multinational corporation in the world and it was the first company to issue stock . 
  it was also arguably the first megacorporation '' ? 
  `` the 17th century is considered amsterdam 's golden age , during which it became the wealthiest city in the world . 
  ships sailed from amsterdam to the baltic sea , north america , and africa , as well as present-day indonesia , india , sri lanka , and brazil , forming the basis of a worldwide trading network . 
  amsterdam 's merchants had the largest share in both the dutch east india company and the dutch west india company . 
  these companies acquired overseas possessions that later became dutch colonies . 
  amsterdam was europe 's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading financial centre of the world . 
  in 1602 , the amsterdam office of the dutch east india company became the world 's first stock exchange by trading in its own shares . '', 
  ** edit ** : i just now saw that you said 16th . . so i said nothing :p  constructed the continent 's first skyscraper [ really ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/witte_huis ) `` the building is 43 m ( 141 ft ) tall , with 10 floors , and was the tallest in europe at the time it was built . 
  it was also the first hoogbouw ( literally : high-rise building ) in europe . 
  the building is listed as a rijksmonument . '', 
   on top of all that of course the port is one of the most clearly visible signs of the work of man from outer space ( in daytime too ) . 
  i 'd say that the [ delta works ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delta_works ) [ flevoland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flevoland ) , or even the [ port of rotterdam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_rotterdam ) would most certainly top that . 
  `` eastern flevoland ( oostelijk flevoland or oost-flevoland ) and southern flevoland ( zuidelijk flevoland or zuid-flevoland ) , unlike the noordoostpolder , have peripheral lakes between them and the mainland : the veluwemeer and gooimeer respectively , ** making them , together , the world 's largest artificial island ** . '', 
  just rustling your feathers , 
  well , the biggest problem is simply the housing crisis . . and that 's not going to solve itself any time soon . 
  well , i think even the media here has a tendency to stay calm and to not over react . . most people think that it 'll blow over . 
  right now more attention is given to the money we 're spending on bailing out greece and cyprus than our own economic crisis . 
  [ even the most sensationalist newspaper does n't have much on the crisis these days ] ( http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&amp;depth=1&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.telegraaf.nl/&amp;usg=alkjrhjhurxj8f66zcp1pyhsda8ypkmmpw ) . 
  [ this page may give you a good overview of how prominent the crisis is in todays economic news . . this is the economy page of the most popular ` quick ' news site in the netherlands ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nu.nl%2feconomie%2f&amp;act=url ) . 
  i 'd say we 're still pretty calm about it all . . and that 's probably a good thing ( even though there are abviously serious problems with our housing market ) . 
  nothing suddenly happened . . the figures that came out this week where pretty much in line with expectations , and the crisis has been going on for quite a while now . 
  so i hardly see why this is surprising ; it 's also not actually a news article but more of an editorial . 
  and we 're getting a large part of the industrial ruhr area . . economy goes boom . 
  seriously . . ? 
  the amount of people not getting a simple joke here is staggering . 
   i 'm not interested in any amount of fecal matter on my eggs . 
  you eat the shells ? 
  i get the occasional feather or shitstain on them - makes them look authentic . 
  do n't confuse discriminating based on someone 's nationality , citizenship or geographical location with discrimination based on race . 
  yeah . . 
  i do n't quite understand what the guy above is talking about . . 
   people outside germany may not like her is that the case ? 
  i 'm dutch so i do n't really have a good view on that . . over here she 's regarded as a trustworthy and competent leader . . but i suspect the only regions where she 's severely disliked are greece , italy and spain because of the austerity measures . . or are there other reasons as well ? 
  the fact that there are smaller countries that do show greater inequality does not disprove that a more homogeneous and smaller populous helps in sustaining equality . 
  right , but you 'd usually make comparisons with countries with similarities in for instance political systems ( democracies ) , geographical locations ( fertile lands , relatively colder climates ) etc. 
  no point in comparing finland with djibouti . 
  you wait for them to cool down a bit , or bite off a small part of the exterior so the scorching napalm heat can escape . 
   the us has an issue with inequality , but that does n't change the fact that 50 % of the households in the country make more than $ 52k a year , which is very high considering average cost of living . 
  and what percentage lives below the poverty line ? 
   in november 2012 the u.s. census bureau said more than 16 % of the population lived in poverty , including almost 20 % of american children , [ 8 ] up from 14.3 % ( approximately 43.6 million ) in 2009 and to its highest level since 1993 . 
  in 2008 , 13.2 % ( 39.8 million ) americans lived in poverty . 
  [ 9 ] starting in the 1980s , relative poverty rates have consistently exceeded those of other wealthy nations . 
  [ 10 ] california has a poverty rate of 23.5 % , the highest of any state in the country . 
  [ 11 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poverty_in_the_united_states, 
   no , you would have filled an application for federal student loans and they would have paid does ` loan ' over there mean ` get money for free ' ? 
  i do n't understand the connotation mcdonalds or burger king has as being ` cheap ' . 
  i 'd have to pay over 5 euro 's for a simple large cheeseburger . . and i 'm still hungry afterwards . 
  yet numerous people would still say they believe in ` some kind of god or higher power ' , making them theistic . 
  no ; they 're theistic , just not religious . 
  they 're basically not . 
  a lot of non-religious people still say they `` are a spiritual person '' and `` do believe in something , just not a typical god being '' . 
  h&m because they used a model wearing a hijab ? 
  raising someone without such constraints and letting them choose for themselves at a certain age does ` go both ways ' ? 
  a company should target their market with ads ... if young women with hijabs are their market , then it 's not that odd to feature them in your ads . 
  and therefore taxes are higher in denmark .
