  the strike you mentioned was mostly organized by the communist party ( cpn ) with cooperation from resistance leaders , not exactly representative of the population at large . 
  it does n't tell you how society in general thought about rounding up the jews . 
  the last time our government really showed some grit was when mh17 was shot down , most notably frans timmermans who did a great job with handling the situation . 
  so not all that long ago really . 
  [ luckily there were people who tried to make the work of the germans much harder . 
  ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/aanslag_op_het_amsterdams_bevolkingsregister_1943 ) in the end they were n't very succesful , only 15 % of all documents were destroyed and there was an office with duplicates in den haag . 
  their bravery is what counts though . 
  imo a funny example of this is ` grote ' ( bijv . 
  naamwoord/noun ) , they describe the size/dimensions of something . 
  they 're pronounced exactly the same but are obviously used quite differently . 
  dit is absoluut fantastisch, 
  anarchist came as absolutely no surprise, 
  honestly , that is really amazing . 
  for the record , that 'd be like 99 % of the dutch population living in the province of limburg . 
  netherlands is 41543 km ^ 2 large when it comes to area , so : 41543 km ^ 2 * 5,5 % = 2284,9 km ^ 2 [ limburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provinces_of_the_netherlands ) ( without water ) comes close to that . 
  then again , egypt and limburg are rather similar / s, 
   narrow deck ... low taxes ... still a big cargo hold  kinda proves that when it comes to avoiding taxes , people were just as creative then as they are now . 
  i can see the humor in the effort that went in building special ships to do so , unlike through legal/tax law technicalities . 
  a wooden testament to tax avoidance is far more impressive than a pile of paperwork imo . 
  what a beauty , how old is she ? 
  awww, 
  yes , they are the economic power houses along with north brabant, 
  its the same as people calling the netherlands holland , which are only 2 of the 12 provinces ... 
  does n't really matter either way , what matters is the jovial rivalry that grew out of it , 
  iirc it just started as a running joke on / r/thenetherlands and it kinda went from there but i could be wrong . 
  wait , this is on netflix ? 
  edit : holy shit it actually is, 
  tremendous !,

  yeah , i was that guy . '',

  everyone knows benelux is best regional alliance . 
  not again, 
  do n't worry joe , cause you 're the type of guy anybody wants to have drinks and a laugh with . 
  a modified version of the [ `` thanks obama '' ] ( https://youtu.be/uhy9zxv1-oo ) meme should be made , where everytime the uk needs to blame someone obama is replaced with eu . 
  okay i 'm still not convinced but can see where you 're coming from . 
  i guess i interpreted your op as being far more individualist , this comment adds more nuance to your argument imo . 
   what i argue is that the goals of individuals and societal goals have to have an overlap . 
  they can not be two absolutely separate things . 
  there are cases where goals are forced on to people -- those are immoral regimes that do not respect their citizens . 
  i 'm not 100 % in agreement with you here but not because i like authoritarianism . 
  in some sense goals are forced on to you by society but they are n't necessarily bad goals to be exposed to . 
  for example : from the moment you were born it has been society 's goal to eventually make you a person who contributes to society in one way or another , whether you 'll become a scientist , lorry driver , police officer , artist , clergy etc does n't really matter what it is as long as you eventually do something ( this is n't some harsh libertarian/conservative criticism of the unemployed and/or disabled btw , unemployment is a very different matter entirely . 
  i 'm not a libertarian or ableist either , far from it ) . 
  in some sense then , society 's goal has been to provide you with the knowledge and/or training by ways of education . 
  your parents obviously did a large part of raising you as well , but you 'll find that their goal of making you a healthy and intelligent individual was always extremely similar to the goal of society in the first place . 
  a society whose citizens are educated is healthy and usually generates more money and therefore tax revenue . 
  if you want i can try to support my education argument with data/sources but i 've had a long day today so it 'd have to be tomorrow it might be a little optimistic but there 's nothing wrong with that , nothing wrong with working and self sufficiency . 
  the way i see it is that , like you said earlier , goals of individuals can and do shape society 's goals but society 's goals also shape an individual 's goals . 
  this is a nice civil discussion though , good to have for a change . 
   from a more individualist than collectivist perspective , i argue that the goals of society can not be different than the goals of its building blocks , the individuals . 
  so we can not say something is not an individual matter but it is a societal matter , or the other way around . 
  one does not go without the other . 
  i disagree with this sentiment , because it requires an ever present degree of selfishness , but its plain to see that lots of people perform all kinds of selfless acts for the betterment of society and those around them all the time . 
  whether those initiatives are through churches , charity or on their own behalf does n't really matter . 
  they placed the health/well being of others above their own . 
  personal sacrifices oftentimes have to be made to ensure that society 's goals are met ( think of taxes etc ) also the sheer amount of different goals all the individuals in a society have would make catering to those goals and needs an unworkable task . 
  those goals often massively contradict one another as well . 
  [ / r/murica intensifies ] ( http://static.thesuperficial.com/uploads/2014/04/16/freedom-boner.gif ), 
  you could say that the netherlands is somewhat multi-ethnic , with the frisians in the north with their own language and culture/heritage compared to the rest . 
  i 'm probably biased since i used to live in frysl\u00e2n until not too long ago but imho frisian culture is the most distinctly different from ( other ) dutch culture ( s ) at large . 
  it 's very debatable though , because once you open that can of worms groningers , tukkers/twentenaren , limburgers and ( north - ) brabanders will claim their own ethnic/cultural heritage as being distinctly different from general dutch culture as well , and probably rightfully so . 
  what is n't debatable is that we have the [ cutest goddamn flag ever ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/frisian_flag.svg/800px-frisian_flag.svg.png ) with its adorable little hearts/pompebl \u00eaden ( * nuphar lutea * , yellow water lilly ) . 
  no other province comes close , not even you north-brabant . 
  should have been * `` frysl\u00e2n is foar frijers '' * instead of * `` virginia is for lovers '' * .

   fixed fortifications are a monument to the stupidity of man . 
  patton, 
  your own username already tells you what you should n't do , do n't feed the troll . 
  you do know that the vast majority ( except malta ) in all those countries who joined in 2004 supported joining the eu ? 
  its not like the idea of joining the eu was impopular at the time in those countries . 
  laws have to be changed in order to join the eu , but it seems like that was a sacrifice the populace of the countries who joined in 2004 were more than willing to make . 
  you 're not going to convince me that 13,5 million people were paid to vote for joining the eu back when poland held its eu referendum in 2003 . 
  contrary to the past is that eu membership is voluntary , so since they chose to become a member they should abide by the rules as well . 
  not op also not british but dutch , but i loathe our colonial past because it robbed indigenous people of their lives and livelihoods by the thousands . 
  it is a fundamentally racist , oppressive and exploitative institution that only served to enrich ourselves and not the places we colonized . 
  sure we may have gave them european systems like democracy to some extent , but is that really any sort of achievement after slaving them away for centuries ? 
  is that something you want to be proud of ?

  the bit between almere and lelystad are absolutely gorgeous . 
  this is hilarious, 
  we do have politicians who copycat yours tho , sometimes at least . 
  in the netherlands we have jesse klaver , he 's only 30 yo but already the leader of his party groenlinks ( left green/eco progressives , currently 4 seats in parliament ) but seems to take a lot of inspiration from president obama 's campaign speeches . 
  so much so that he thinks that his life 's story is similar to obama 's [ ( it sort of is i guess ) ] ( http://www.elsevier.nl/nederland/achtergrond/2016/09/jesse-klaver-mikpunt-van-spot-ik-lijk-best-op-obama-367128/ ) and he 's been exposed for translating parts of obama 's speeches/slogans and using them for himself . 
  ca n't really give you anything other than dutch sources such as this [ zondag met lubach piece ] ( https://youtu.be/lsvgykmhkkg ) ( arjan lubach is sort of or jon stewart/john oliver ) where klaver was exposed for this . 
  i respect him for his ambition and such , but he 's got to be a bit more creative than stealing someone else 's style . 
  exactly !, 
  your edit is the exact point i was trying to make , could n't really find the right words for it i guess . 
  but yeah , your edit is my opinion, 
  see if i 'd heard arguments along the lines like yours i might have been swayed , but i still believe that banning speech is counterproductive . 
  being very intolerant of holocaust denial is great , show the fascist how disgusting his thoughts/ideas are , but you 'd have to be allowed to talk to the fascist in the first place . 
  i never said i wanted tolerance towards holocaust deniers , i just do n't think opinions should be made illegal .
