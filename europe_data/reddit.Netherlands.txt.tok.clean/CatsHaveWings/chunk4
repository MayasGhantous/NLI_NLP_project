  bash the fash ( verbally/rhetorically/factually ) . 
  as long as you do n't care about being taken seriously by the vast majority of historians though . 
  i do n't really understand what you 're trying to ask . . 
  but anyway , the last conversation i had about holocaust denial with someone was somewhere around june/july , so before the entire topic of fake news came up . 
  it was also never brought up because of trump or anything , it just kinda happened . 
  edit : should 've read the question a couple more times but no i think that for most of them it was about the actual repulsiveness of holocaust denial , not about fake news or alternate/revisionist history . 
  i was most amazed by my sister ( law student ) who thought holocaust denial should be and remain illegal for the time being , but that was her first year of law school , idk what her opinion is now . 
  you 'd be amazed how many people still believe holocaust denial should be illegal/punishable , at least among everyone i 've talked about the topic with , i 'd say about 3/4 people i 've talked to think it should be illegal . 
  most of them do n't really have any arguments why it should be illegal other than the opinion of holocaust denial being repulsive ( or along those lines ) , i completely agree with that sentiment but it is not an argument why it should be illegal . 
  could you perhaps point me to some of those posts on the subs you mentioned ? 
  i thought this analysis was pretty good ( i 've read about 35 pages so far ) , but since this is not my field ( biomedical science ) so i guess i 'm easily persuaded by such reports , at least compared to someone familiar with this sort of analysis .

  for the netherlands : also known as kapoentje in the rotterdam area ( at least where i used to live in voorne-putten ), 
  only to be poldered back into existence by the dutch, 
  i know that , i just thought it was rather fitting in relation to the op i commented on ( with the video ), 
   agreed , but here in europe we 've had several hard filters for the population ( plagues ) - so it 's not a wild theory to postulate that we have a naturally effective immune system . 
  there 's few plagues we 've had here in europe that have n't affected other densely populated parts of the world ( the black death originally came from central asia ) . 
  we do have a very good immune system but the immune system of many sub-saharan populations [ respond better/stronger to infections ] ( http://www.nature.com/news/neanderthal-dna-affects-ethnic-differences-in-immune-response-1.20854 ) ( though they are also more prone to auto-immune diseases ) . 
  it 's been suggested that traces of neanderthal dna in european , asian and middle eastern populations contribute to the fact that our immuneresponse is n't as drastic as in sub-saharan populations , [ and that we 're more prone to allergies ] ( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-01/cp-ngg123015.php ) . 
  i ca n't say for sure whether that 's all true because anthropology is n't my field , i 'd have to ask a friend for that ( archeologist researching neanderthals ) . 
   obviously for the past 100 or so years , we 've taken steps to prevent `` the weak '' ( for lack of a better term ) from dying , but presumably it will take longer than that to bread the resistance out of us ? 
  i 'm afraid i ca n't really answer that , evolutionary biology is not my field either . 
  if i had to take a guess i 'd say that it would indeed take a pretty long time . 
  some say ... 
  i 'm not an immunologist either , just a biomed laboratory analyst ( in the immunology/medical microbiology area though ) . 
  my comment was intended to expand on yours not attack it in any way  and btw , it takes a bigger person to admit what he does n't know . 
  you do n't see that on reddit all that often .

   diseases like sickle cell being an obvious exception another example of increased genetic immunity to disease ( malaria in both cases ) is g6pdh deficiency . 
  a side effect of that is that you ca n't eat certain foods ( fava beans for example ) or take certain drugs . 
   if there are genes which affect how good our immune system is at fighting certain types of diseases , then plagues would be good filters for selecting these . 
  yes there are genes ( that i know of ) that affect the effectiveness of your immune system against pathogens . 
  the diversity of your hla genes is an important factor in combatting certain diseases , a greater hla diversity is generally assumed to result in a better immune system ( but the enormous genetic variations in hla alleles makes investigating this very difficult ) . 
  that 's only one factor though , there 's many more genes involved in the immune system than just hla genes . 
  while the basic premise of your comment is indeed correct it 's not as simple as the baby 's immune system kicking in . 
  the effect of the mother 's breast milk last far longer and have a much larger impact on the infant ( short term and long term ) than you might think . 
  there 's a lot of research going on at the moment about the colonization of a post-natal infant 's gut with bacteria from the mother 's gut and whether those bacteria are transported by immune cells from the gut to the mammary glands ( entero-mammary pathway ) . 
  thusfar the entero-mammary pathway is largely hypothetical as it has n't been subject of much research until quite recently . 
  source : did 6 months of research about exactly this at umc groningen until 2 weeks ago , research there still continues but i 'm going to work somewhere else after summer . 
  we do not have a natural resistance against those diseases because our ancestors survived , we have a slightly increased resistance at best . 
  the ones who survived had a better immune system/health to begin with and were thus able to reproduce more succesfully . 
  genetic components of acquired immunity/resistance are not passed on to the descendants because the gametes do not recombine their dna in response to infection , that is not their function . 
  the only cells whose dna is recombined after infection are b lymphocytes ( vdj recombination and isotype switching ) , viral infections like herpes etc not included . 
  a cell can only duplicate the genetic information it has and gametes are not subject to dna recombination because of infection . 
  it could be that i read your comment completely wrong but i interpret it as if you mean that acquired immunity is passed on from generation to generation which is simply not true . 
  yes , you are correct but there 's more to it .

   no other country , except for france , has a concentration of power , money and population centred on the capital iceland ? 
  not in the eu but definitely in europe and about 1/3 of iceland 's inhabitants live in reykjavik proper ( and 2/3 of the entire population live in the capital region ) . 
  i 'd imagine that would make reykjavik very influential in terms of economy and government .
