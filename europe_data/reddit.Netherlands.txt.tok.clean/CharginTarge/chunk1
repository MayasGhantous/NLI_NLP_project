til heerlen is close to the coast . 
  denmark similarly liberal and open minded , also has a bicycle culture and has good food . 
  on second viewing i found indeed a small occurrence of kapsalon in the belgian picture . 
  \\* high-five \\* so it 's only the germans , the british and the french that disappoint me . 
  i 'm disappointed by the lack of kapsalon . 
  i also know of german cars which start with eu , but the reason is a lot less glamorous . 
  it just means you live near euskirchen . 
  then can someone make a chart that expresses the dependance on russian gas as a percentage of the local heating and/or energy market ? 
  no , but i 'm sure the rest of the country would vote yes . 
  i ca n't imagine why . 
  they 've got a nice ferris wheel and everything !, 
  so do the russians . 
  here 's my secret : ryanair, 
  holy cow , it actually is the browser 's fault . 
  opened the same page on internet explorer \\* shudders \\* and there the missing universities do appear . 
  it 's [ not for me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xspr4pc.jpg ) . 
  icl is missing from the list , that 's my point . 
  of course i checked for double rankings , but many universities are simply not there . 
  why is this list incomplete ? 
  even if i get rid of all filters , there are still plenty of universities missing . 
  for example , the top 10 is missing the universities that are ranked 3rd , 5th and 6th . 
  damn it finland, 
  we should call it neuschweinsteiger . 
  nope , both maps are identical [ old link ] ( https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5489/14489964857_2bd28e9483_o.png ) [ new link ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qkc2lxk.png ), 
  i hate to be that guy , but did n't we have this map already a week ago ? 
  `` here is my country 's vote , but first let me give a speech that you 've already heard 20 times before about how much i liked your show , how excited we all are , how much i like your dress bla bla bla '', 
  * i believe the greek might take issue with this statement . 
  besides , this does n't explain why the [ eurovision contest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_broadcasting_union#history ) is held both english and french despite there being more founding members . 
  * ... or am i ? 
  it reminds me too much of the perceived elitism when viewing broadcasts such as the olympics or the eurovision contest . 
  all the announcements and narrations have to be both in english and french for some backwards reason . 
  all the other countries are fine with having dubs , subtitles or simply listening to english , but for some reason the french absolutely have to have their own announcer on the stage . 
  either stick with one language or add a second one that is better represented in the audience . 
  i guess it 's my bad for equating a reddit fad with the olympics , but for some reason it rubs me the wrong way . 
  since there are virtually no diplomats in this subreddit , i fail to see why we should elevate it here . 
  i do n't like it . 
  partly for practical reason . 
  partly because it plays into the french narrative of their language being the european lingua franca , even though [ it is n't ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_sum_en.pdf ) . 
  * alright , but i think this style is kind of pointless since everyone here already knows english , making the whole translation effort rather superfluous . 
  australia should be excused for the word ` cunt ' . 
  it 's not a swear word to them . 
  so , is this official or just another tinfoil theory ? 
  someone was not amused about that speech : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prmjdek1gky, 
  suddenly selling all our tanks does n't seem too smart in hindsight . 
  did we at least keep the receit ? 
  wodka ? 
  not down here !,

  [ original post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/2ept81/stereotypes_of_the_netherlands_oc_2000x2255/ ), 
   i have difficulties believing that its cheaper than in belgium ( flanders ) . 
  [ it is n't ] ( http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/servicecentra/ssc/administratieenpraktischeservices/toelatingeninschrijving/collegegelden/viercollegegeldtarievenvanaf201320141.htm ), 
  for shits and giggles , we might as well add the german areas intended to be annexed as compensation for ww2 . 
  you 'd figure they 'd pick a place to be kidnapped to that does n't have nice weather , beautiful beaches , good food and gorgeous women ... 
  i 'm assuming that these are only intercity connections ? 
  there are too many routes missing , particularly regional routes , for it to be a complete map . 
  it makes no fucking sense . 
  if it 's worth building and maintaining an eastward connection that stops at all the tiny villages , then why the hell is n't it worth to do the same in the other direction ? 
  also , you 'd figure that sooner or later someone of these idiots would look at a map and say `` hey guys , brussels , leuven , hasselt , maastricht , heerlen , aachen , dueren and cologne lie all almost on a straight line . 
  should n't we build a train or something ? 
  '' , but no . 
  some idiot intern called tyrone instead went `` let 's build a shitty tram instead , lawl !, 
  well , we do have an amsterdam-maastricht intercity , it 's the maastricht-cologne part that 's lacking . 
   on a related note : maastricht is planning to build a connection to hasselt ... [ in the form of a tram ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maastricht#by_tram ) . 
  who on earth wants to travel intercity distances in a bloody tram ? 
  if anything , maastricht needs a normal east-west intercity . 
  traveling to cologne takes twice as long by public transport than going by car . 
  why is it so dirty ? 
  scientific conference . 
  would 've preferred copenhagen , but they were n't the ones organizing it . 
  2.5 hour long commute . 
  who on earth would submit himself to that ? 
  [ still got plenty of places to visit ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kb4wdbm.jpg ), 
  go get your own snowworld . 
  right , now we 're suddenly part of the country . 
  sure , bring your kids into an active warzone ... instead of not allowing them to play bloody call of duty !, 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  neglecting the south seems to be a tradition in this country . 
  never had wi-fi on that intercity . 
  there are plans to add wi-fi and maybe a few trains have it already , but most trains do n't . 
  the american amtrak 's have free wi-fi going for them . 
  i 'd rather have that than a pretty train with no wi-fi . 
  looks to me like it 's a publicity stunt by mercedes . 
  same type of caravan , same type of merc and the german one has a stuttgart license plate ( all mercs in ads have a stuttgart license plate since their hq is located there ) . 
  funny , northrhine-westphalia stays exactly as it is . 
  yea , i was expecting a picture of some debris vaguely resembling a missile . 
  the only recent poll was online by an afrikaans newspaper in 2010 , resulting in a small majority of 56 % . 
  the original source is n't available anymore , so there 's no access to the data . 
  the problem here is that the info in wikipedia lacks essential breakdowns , like the tendencies of white and non-white people . 
  it could very well be that a good chunk of these votes are from non-white people who want to get rid of the whites , meaning that a white majority actually wants to stay . 
  i 'm also for self-determination , but so far the results are inconclusive . 
  the fact that there was only one poll in the past 10 years is also an indication that there is no huge urge for separation . 
  scotland , by comparison , has polls all the time and the separatists there get lower scores than 56 % . 
  why are n't there more polls here ? 
  if anything , there need to be more and larger polls that establish that a separation is a clear and persistent wish among the white demographic . 
  are there any reputable surveys or polls that back up this wish or is this just some crackpot theory ? 
  well they got the expanded [ copa america ] ( http://www.concacaf.com/article/concacaf-and-conmebol-announce-agreement-to-bring-copa-america-2016-to-the-united-states ) to look forward to . 
  well , he has a swedish flair , so i figured he might be rooting for sweden as well . 
  what about the euro cup ? 
   martin van persie yea , he and tyrone robben are really the star strikers of the team . 
  apparently opening up wikipedia was way too much work .
