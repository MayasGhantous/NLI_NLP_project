  all they need is some winter coats , really . 
  www.nu.nl gets a lot of traffic, 
  you guys should really introduce a [ koningsdag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koninginnedag ) . 
  hooray for global warming , maastricht becomes a sea-side resort !, 
  what about the top 50 under 50 universities ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ toally ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ biased, 
  what about the [ university of hull ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okuhyo9tm5a ) ? 
  i think you misunderstood me . 
  i was implying that in big cities the nightlife is usually concentrated in a few areas . 
  the rest of the city , a pretty large area compared the the nightlife areas , is usually pretty empty by nighttime . 
  for instance , i was out clubbing in new york once and while there was a lot of nightlife in soho and greenwich , other areas were pretty lifeless during the night . 
  walking through times square with only a handful of people around was pretty eerie . 
  ca n't we cut a few consonants from ` udolf ' ? 
  then we could put [ this ] ( http://www.udo-lindenberg.de/fm/362/thumbnails/%a9%20tine%20acke%201.jpg.55680.jpg ) guy in charge . 
  the speeches would be hilarious . 
  you 're describing pretty much every big city in the world there . 
  got ta love earning money while doing your phd instead of getting 4 more years of debt . 
  and not in a good way : /, 
  most of my friends agree that their favourite word is ` fingerspitzengef\u00fchl ' . 
  rpg 's are terrible against air targets . 
  a proper surface-to-air missile has some sort of targeting system . 
  try speaking to someone from bocholtz . 
  even though i speak both dutch and german i ca n't make out a word they 're saying . 
   dutch , netherlan ... dish ...   i do n't see any difference between them , but they sound damn hilarious :d to be fair , the difference between these two is ** really ** small . 
  it 's better if someone would just write up the lists and post them here in the comments . 
  now it looks like you went home and took a wrong turn . 
  it 's [ all practically the same thing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_bavaria ) , anyway . 
  now it 's changed . 
  what is this treachery ? 
  thanks , putin !, 
  :( edit : aww , mine stayed the same : /, 
  i think the spanish will want to have a word with you about that . 
  irish phone ? 
  south, 
  i did n't even need to be elected as i was the only running candidate for the post of ~ ~ dictator ~ ~ ~ ~ president ~ ~ spokesperson of limburg . 
  seriously though , i thought this is common sense . 
  heck , i have only been living here for 10 years , so i know that my insight is not that representative of the region and everyone should take it with a grain of salt ( or a piece of vlaai ) . 
  or you could just use your legs to stabilize yourself when motionless instead of falling over like an idiot . 
  should be an easy partitioning this time around . 
  poland gets 100 % of poland and russia gets 0 % . 
  so the uk is just the geopolitical equivalent of these annoying websites that steal content and put their watermark on it . 
  they do have to get rid of that first . 
  ca n't steal a country if they already have a flag . 
  what i do n't understand here is why would russia opt to annex crimea instead of building ports one the coast between sochi and rostov-on-don . 
  they already have plenty of land bordering the black sea , why risk an international conflict or economic sanctions ? 
  eh , it was a tough read anyway , so now at least i do n't have to finish it . 
  [ the title was all i needed ] ( http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/938/1/sinn-pay-as-you-go-system-fertility.pdf ) . 
  cheers , 
  you got a link to the paper ? 
  i 'd be interested to read it . 
  apparently german law enforcement has been outsourced to liam neeson . 
  the german one also says both have 11 seats . 
  a more reasonable land-route would be along the most stable countries of the west coast of africa and crossing the ocean to either fortaleza or recife . 
  castro/cameron , it 's so hard to tell these guys apart . 
  some more good stuff : [ peter fox - alles neu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd0a2plmsva ) [ fettes brot - jein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-53ltszswg ) [ herbert groenemeyer - mensch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sg5a3pyaus ) [ paul van dyk - for an angel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnrmwhaodu8 ) [ scooter - one ( always hardcore ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5pdgyozjte ) [ atb - hold you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av37iuabhni ), 
  dey took our jerbs !, 
   ... leader of the far-right freedom party ( pvv ) that is leading in dutch polls for may 's european parliament elections ... 
  who did they poll ? 
  only pvv voters ? 
  also increasingly a different pronunciation , spelling and vocabulary . 
  they really should re-brand themselves . 
  now they just come across as a one-issue party even though their policies in other areas are also decent . 
  genius !, 
  we already have all the belgian beers here in the pubs . 
  no need to cross the border , 
  was that even up for discussion ? 
  you should start by fixing your coffee machine . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3y0cd2cocs ), 
  itt : grammar nazi 's ruining a michael jackson joke . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=zi_xlobdo_y#t=124 ) is how i imagine it 'll look like . 
  we beat finland again !, 
  was more referring to the dutch cuisine in general . 
  you can get game , cheese and stews everywhere if you hop over the border . 
  we do have vlaai here , but i would n't rate as the most healthy food , or cheapest . 
  thank god they did n't compare local cuisines . 
  i 'm pretty sure we 're only two steps away from frying an old shoe and calling it a meal . 
  similarly , you 'd need to be a microbiologist to know who antonie van leeuwenhoek and a physicist to know who christiaan huygens were . 
  in general , the general public are n't aware of any historically significant scientists unless they for some reason attract huge publicity or their research is taught in school . 
  so , since school material has stayed pretty much the same the past century it 's pretty much a given that you here about more recent significant developments once you decide to make them your career . 
  you should 've dressed it up like a [ wookie ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo6m4ngkrp0 ), 
  we may be lacking lab coats and bunsen burners , but we can still fill up an evil laboratory with robots . 
  so be careful of dissing computer scientists , we may send a robot after you !,

  how about a modern important scientist : [ edsger dijkstra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edsger_w._dijkstra ) ? 
  received a turing award and invented the , appropriately named , [ dijkstra 's algorithm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dijkstra%27s_algorithm ) . 
  coming to theaters near you : * the cloggering *, 
  they 'll probably have to add in a few explosions . 
  traveling a few thousand kilometers just to fill in some paperwork does n't sound all that interesting . 
  [ of course they are all dialects of old germanic . 
  ] ( http://static1.fjcdn.com/comments/4947283+_eb401048c9e0e32681f0125b978dc203.png ) the lower saxon dialect is also heavily influenced by frisian , a region shared by both countries that has it 's own language ( never say that frisian is not a language to a frisian , you 'll end up with stab wounds ) . 
  looking more south , koelsch also has an uncanny resemblance to dutch , though only very few germans will ever admit that . 
  on the flip-side , the limburgians switch out dutch with german words whenever they fancy . 
  so what you end up with is a region with a multitude of dialects which are linguistically identical , which are still completely unintelligible to anyone that is n't a native speaker . 
  maybe it 's german that is a dialect of dutch . 
  they did mention him as the polish entry , though if you believe the [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_in_poland ) entry , it should be something entirely different . 
  right , might as well start writing dates in non-logical order , measure weights and distances using random tangible objects and exchange goods and services by bartering cows or goats . 
  :p ^ ^ i ^ might ^ be ^ overreacting ^ a ^ little, 
  in the age of the guilder , i learned to write my local currency as 10 , - dm , so i still put the $ after the amount out of habit . 
  the spice must flow !, 
  indeed , i 'm used to the other one .
