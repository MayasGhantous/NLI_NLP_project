  even without the human-rights thing i 'd want them removed . 
  they are n't in the eu , nor located on the european continent , so there 's no reason to consider israel part of europe . 
  been there 2 years ago . 
  it was reilly weird . 
  at one point you 're walking through a street devoid of life . 
  then you turn a corner and suddenly there 's a single pub that if overfull to the brim . 
  if you want to do a pubcrawl in ghent , you likely have to be capable of running a marathon , most of it while drunk . 
  even worse , he had only [ 5 days to retirement ] ( http://cornerpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/too-old1.jpg ) . 
  going by how long welsh town names can get , i 'm just going to assume that this directly translates to `` no '' . 
  those big iron-y things that we sold on ebay , remember ? 
  i love all those sidejabs at the bild in the article . 
  `` yea , it 's a slow news day . 
  look what those morons are writing ! '', 
  you 'd be surprised what improper lighting can do to your teeth color . 
  it 's really depressing if you have a bathroom with the wrong kind of light . 
  as if a tourist is ever dumb enough to go there ? 
  * ooh , honey , look at all those factories !, 
  are n't they pretty ? 
  you have to admit , dutch people that can barely speak english attempting to speak english does sound hilarious . 
  great , for some deranged reason that thread was posted a day ago so that it now is on the second page , which i of course did n't expect since on a sunday this thread is supposed to be new . 
  could n't have explained it better myself . 
  i was trying to search youtube for a clip where someone sais the word , but , given the literal meaning , doing so at work might be a bit risky . 
  i know some more creative ones . 
  literally it means ` full pole ' , probably implying that the described person is so stupid that he/she runs straight on into poles . 
  * wixvorlage - masturbation inspiration . 
  used for women with good looks but a dumb/toxic personality * turnbeutelvergesser - looser . 
  literally it means ` gym-bag forgetter ' , originally used for school children who fail at the simple task of remembering to bring their sports stuff to school on gym day . 
  * sitzpinkler - similar to turnbeutelvergesser , but here the implication is that a guy is such a wimp that he voluntarily urinates while sitting down . 
  a lump of vomit , used for describing a guy with toxic personality . 
  i guess the implication is that whatever words come out of his mouth are equivalent to verbal vomit . 
  * backpfeiffengesicht - a bitch-slap face . 
  a person with such an annoying face that it is in dire need of a slap . 
  * hartz 4 empfaenger - social welfare receiver , where hartz 4 is the name of the law regulating unemployment welfare . 
  used for people which you perceive as social leeches , who refuse to work so they can spend other people 's money . 
  * sonntagsfaher - a bad driver . 
  literally it means ` sunday driver ' , implying that the described person only uses the car on sunday for leisure driving . 
  the implcations are that either said person is driving so slowly that he/she annoys everybody else or that , by only driving on sundays , he/she forgot how to drive and is now a menace on the road . 
  now we 'll need a day to find out whether d49a1d852468799cac08 is offended or not . 
  god , i miss those . 
  the dutch definition of bread probably violates the geneva convention . 
  because the game does n't take czechia as an answer , i spent 5 minutes second guessing my spelling of that country 's name . 
  google does n't really count since it is n't really a proper english word , but rather a brand name that became synonymous with the service it provides ( every company 's wet dream ) . 
  you have the same going on in the german language , for instance when someone asks for a ` tempo ' instead of a ` taschentuch ' . 
  otherwise though , i try to avoid pretentious denglish slang as much as possible . 
  same here , i 'm starting to see a trend here ... 
  if you are going to visit all the different places , i 'd recommend you stay at a central location to keep the cost of travelling down . 
  preferably with access to a big airport ( or high-speed railway ) . 
  no way . 
  car makers have their own dealerships all over the place . 
  ** the netherlands ** * mostly international news . 
  turkey/brazil protests , prism and mandela 's health frequent the headlines . 
  newsstations are keeping quiet with regards to the prism thing , given that our government also had access to it . 
  * a bunch of students in rotterdam broke into their school and stole the french test for the final examination . 
  they sold them to other students for up to 250 bucks . 
  everyone involved had to retake the exam . 
  * the new king and queen have been touring around the country as a kind of get-to-know-the-country tour . 
  * lots of mudslinging regarding the fyra debacle ( our high-speed train that falls apart when you look at it funny ) . 
  the makers are now accusing the dutch railway ( ns ) that they did n't maintain the trains like they recommended . 
  a day later they got more blunt and flat out said that ns were incompetent ( i 'd agree with that to be frankly ) . 
  * suicides have reached a new peak since 1984 , with a 10 % increase over last year . 
  going by today 's headlines i might have to move away here myself . 
  probably to germany . 
  funny how germany takes civil rights and privacy far more seriously than the us . 
  nobody would 've said this 60 years ago . 
  though i would have to import all my movies and video games , since germany is a giant killjoy in that aspect by censoring everything . 
  : / that leaves an interesting question though . 
  now that the american dream has officially become a nightmare , which country is now the ` promised land ' of the world ? 
  if we 're abiding the law , then the government has no right to invade our privacy . 
  next they 'll leave the packages at the front door , light them on fire , ring the doorbell and hide in the bushes . 
  most mature campaign , ever . 
  the english pronunciation of that word is hilarious though :d, 
  meanwhile , geert wilders his haircut has achieved sentience and is plotting to take over the world . 
  so everything stays the same , really . 
  you do realize that they build a special [ high speed railway ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/hogesnelheidslijn_schiphol_-_antwerpen ) between amsterdam and brussel for the sole use for a high-speed train ? 
  if they thought that you could get around fast enough with already available options , then they would n't have built this in the first place . 
  just because the fyra 's only practical use is as a low-speed stop-and-go train does n't mean it was intended as such . 
   also , by poking around in [ wikipedia ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/fyra ) , i found out that actually they had offers by the manufacturers of the tgvs and ices , but choose for the fyra because they offered a faster train at a lower price . 
  who would have thought that choosing the cheaper option which promises more features would result in a product of much lower quality ? 
   it 's now become apparent it will remain ** used ** for many years to come . 
  do n't you mean unused ? 
  otherwise this would hardly be news . 
  `` breaking news !, 
  in a stunning turn of events , it turns out that germans are going to keep using the autobahn for many years to come !, 
  and now bob with the weather ! '', 
  anyway , i guess i 'll never undestand why they did n't just buy some french tgvs or german ices and call it a day . 
  so far i 've seen a sjoerd , sietse and femke . 
  that can only mean one thing ... frisians are invading the entire country !, 
   spain , germany team up to fight ** youth employment ** so they 're gon na fire everyone who is under 25 ? 
  if you 're not german , this one [ defies explanation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gqdpeywg5g ) . 
  i 'm guessing the guy with the tools is poland . 
  he has red-white sleeves similar to their flag and their stereotype is that they do everyone 's handywork . 
  armenian host singing obnoxiously : `` should i leave or should i stay tonight ??? '', 
  graham : `` you should leave . '', 
  british bicycle cams are the western equivalent to russian dashcams . 
  really ?

  12 points everywhere guaranteed !,

  what the flying fuck ?
