   this would appear to suggest pakistanis are more racially tolerant than even the germans or the ** dutch ** the dutch were n't even included in the survey . 
  what kind of shitty conclusion is this ? 
  hmm , this story is oddly familiar ... 
  holy moly , just noticed how terrible google is at translating dutch . 
  here 's a translation that does n't cause me to gouge my eyes out :  ** 1 and 2 cent coins must go **  the 1 and 2 eurocent coins can be disposed of . 
  this is one of four proposals made by the eu commission this thursday . 
   the production and distribution of these coins are loss generating and hardly anyone use these coins for their payments . 
   four different scenarios have been proposed , one being the reduction of production costs of the coins by using cheaper materials . 
   another option is getting the coins out of circulation within a short time frame . 
  then , from a set point in time these coins would cease to be legal currency . 
   alternatively the coins can be slowly phased out . 
  after the production of the coins is halted , the coint would then slowly disappear from circulation . 
  the last option would be to do nothing at all . 
   ** preference **  the eu board does not have a preference for any option . 
  the commision will convene with different parties in order to reach a conclusion . 
   currently , the usage of the cent coints differs in each country . 
  in the netherlands every price is rounded to the nearest 5 cent amount , however the coins remain legal currency . 
  in beligum every price is still expressed in their exact value . 
   the dutch retail industry finds the proposal reasonable . 
  `` we try to limit the usage of 1 and 2 cent coins as much as possible , this saves us a lot of hassle . '', 
  sais a representative . 
   this representative thinks that the dutch know a `` charming sollution '' . 
  `` maybe the eu can consider rounding prices to the nearest 5 cents , it is worth looking into . '', 
  it 's the same here , however this is a eu wide initiative and depending on the implemented solution the coins might get completely removed from circulation and from a certain point in time are not legal tender anymore . 
  to give you an idea , there are two frankfurts in germany .

  yeah , that 's the issue . 
  how do you represent a region which , though having a clearly defined border in the past did not have a flag in that time ? 
  i figured you could take some historical liberties to make it work . 
  else someone would have to make a merger of the two flags of some kind . 
  have the two flags side by side is probably not a good idea since they do share the red lion as central theme and having two lions would make the flair unrecognizable . 
  you could for instance recreate the yellow and blue bars behind the belgian lion so you have one flag with elements from the different two in it . 
  i figured we could just use the flag of the [ duchy of limburg ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/flag_of_the_duchy_of_limburg_%2819th_century%29.png ) as a representative of the region .

  last year there was a shortage of road salt after one day of snow . 
  they did n't stock enough because they did n't expect it to snow during the winter ...

   at&t would be able to quickly upgrade network technology and ** introduce more profitable pricing schemes ** which means they want to introduce annoying schemes that nobody wants , like data caps , data usage charges and advertising network speeds that only hold up at 4am or something but slow down to a crawl during peak hours . 
  there 's a reason we do n't have these anymore . 
  nobody bloody wanted them and migrated to other providers that had simple reliable flatrates . 
  it 's completely ludicrous for them to think that after 10 years the same bs will suddenly work again . 
  the only reason they get away with this in the us is the lack of competition . 
  i hope they stay far far away from this continent .
