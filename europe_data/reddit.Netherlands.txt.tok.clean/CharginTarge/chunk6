  getting strong allies is very important anyway , especially if you 're right next to a big empire and want to start your own thing . 
  got ta keep your allies happy though by sending your chancellor there , otherwise they wo n't join your wars . 
  i am . 
  while i am a proponent for harboring refugees in general , i do want things to proceed in an orderly fashion and not the clusterf * ck it is at the moment . 
  particularly , i 'd like a comprehensive approach of weeding out economic migrants and jihadists from the refugee stream , so the former group has to deal with the regular immigration process ( using the county 's immigration policy , i.e. 
  taking into account education , the economy , immigrant quotas yadda yadda yadda ) and the latter gets an all-incusive first-class ticket back to wherever they came from . 
  tl ; dr i want to help people escaping an actual warzone , not people intending to create one and/or benefit spongers, 
  so op 's video is basically the inverse of [ this well known one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xuidrxdmc ), 
  i 'm aware that there are more since google kindly provided a sorted list of mountains when looking for the tallest one in sweden . 
  [ ] yes , become north-east limburg , kebnekaise becomes first official mountain of the netherlands, 
  that 's one way to get into nato ... 
  do n't murder anybody . 
  people from groningen really hate that . 
  surprised to see fdp listed as obscure , given that they were in the government a couple of times . 
  they might be small now , but they 're not obscure as people generally know who they are . 
  the threads dead , so in case you want the answer : [ the battle of castle itter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_for_castle_itter ), 
  nope, 
  well , i remembered a quote about him , `` when alexander saw the breadth of his domain he wept for there were no more worlds to conquer '' , which kind of fit . 
  the battle of thermopylae, 
  the tulip bubble during the dutch golden age . 
  wrong . 
  once enemies , now united against a common foe . 
  also tennis . 
  hint : one ally and the new enemy used to be on the same side hint 2 : during ww2, 
  3 : alexander the great 4 : german invasion of russia, 
  what does the second year number signify ? 
  the year when gdp growth turned positive again ? 
  the year gdp reached pre-default level ? 
  i meant that assuming the intention of sale i 'd rather see them go to a friend who has national security concerns . 
  if it were up to me then we would 've kept them . 
  how can an army not have tanks for defense ? 
  that approach to national defense has been proven to be [ plain stupid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_netherlands#royal_dutch_army ) . 
  i 'm glad our last tanks are going to finland and not just some arbitrary middle eastern country . 
  looking at the map gave me an idea . 
  if you 'd split up your country into hundreds of tiny city states , you could effectively create a super powerful voting bloc that would win every eurovision forever . 
  [ in other news , water is wet .

  dunno if it 's going to be any good , but it looks friggin sweet . 
  pretty much what i was thinking . 
  he has this ` strong man ' - image to protect to keep his popularity up , so he ca n't afford being seen looking sickly . 
  do n't tell that to / r/worldnews though or you 'll interrupt their witch-hunt circlejerk . 
  also , for the first time in 150 years a wild wolf has been spotted in the netherlands . 
  is this the danish version of the onion or is this actually news ? 
  in the south of the netherlands it 's a tossup between germans ( not counting the students here ) and belgians ( specifically wallonians ) . 
  the germans drive up to you in a bmw and ask where nearest coffee shop is while blaring loud music from their speakers . 
  the wallonians drive up to you in a renault to ask for directions in french since they are always lost . 
  attempting to talk to them in dutch/german/english always fails as they speak only french and not a word else . 
  once you get them out of their cars they 're fine . 
  there 's a dutch church that seems to have taken that nomenclature quite [ literally ] ( http://www.breurhenket.com/koepelkerk/koepelkerk2012.jpg ), 
  so now you need scaffolding for the scaffolds ... ^ ^ ^ ^ [ scaffoldception ] ( http://www.starrfmonline.com/kitnes/cache/images/800x/0/1.2013176.png ), 
  because the picture was taken during the 2008 euros , which switzerland and austria hosted . 
  ~ ~ also , the flag on the boat in reality was the [ danish ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/uuf95/so_denmark_won_10_against_the_netherlands_last/c4yno80 ) flag , after they beat the netherlands 1-0 . ~ ~ edit : fair enough , apparently it 's the other way round , which makes the whole thing even more petty as the dutch did n't even play the germans that tournament, 
  i do n't think it 's meant to deter block voting , but rather keeping the vote more exciting . 
  what they 'll do now is first do the jury votes in the usual way . 
  then , one after one they give each country the ** total ** amount of points received through the televote , starting with the lowest scoring country first . 
   69 % would support it if cou ** n ** tries ~ ~ you refuge ~ ~ ** who refuse ** to participate in a joi ** nt ** solution get less money from the eu was confused by that one for a bit . 
  the small correction should make it clearer . 
  dear belgium , you make the best beer in the world . 
  it 's worlds better than the crap we export ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ tell ^ ^ ^ ^ anyone ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ our ^ ^ ^ ^ economy ^ ^ ^ ^ might ^ ^ ^ ^ collapse . 
  top so called gear, 
  and the spaceport will be called europa anyway just to confuse you even more . 
  the mission , codenamed ` operation ryanair ' , is expected to be a complete success . 
  [ relevant satw ] ( http://satwcomic.com/art/border-control.jpg ),

  i 'm thinking that people who wash their hands * without * using soap also tend to click no . 
  what a coincidence , there 's already lectures for that . 
   ... earn 600 euros a month in lithuania ( ... they are afraid we will leave after a year or two ) has nobody so far slapped their ceo 's on the back of their head and shouted `` well duh !, 
  spawn more overlords !, 
  - level 100 : wales, 
  he did , and i bet they have some high profile players on their payroll even today . 
  probably because then the websites themselves would be liable for all the malware and viruses that advertisers are trying to push on unsuspecting users . 
  my job here is done . 
  or you could simply not go to their website . 
  the only thing bild is genuinely good for is their football rumors since they are suprisingly accurate . 
  however , since these are typically picked up by other papers/pages as well i do n't have to go to their actual website to find out . 
  so you 're saying that , given a comparable population size , the amount of participants in the final competition is statistically independent from the amount of medals earned ? 
  maybe it 's you who should pick up a statistics book ... 
  completely disregarding the fact that the eu got to field way more athletes since all countries participated individually . 
  i bet that if all us states got to participate separately as well it would be a lot closer . 
  and much lower recharge times . 
  i do n't want the car trips to holiday destinations to become multi-day affairs . 
   i was quite disappointed to find out that a certain german leader was missing . 
  there 's a mod that swaps out bismarck for him . 
  his unique traits are underwhelming though . 
  warning , it crowd spoiler : http://i.imgur.com/uf1vqab.gif, 
  it 's obviously ` brexpats say no of to no berlin brexit ', 
  fyi , with ballermann they mean [ this ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ballermann_6 ) place in palma de mallorca , which is taken over by german holiday-goers every summer . 
  i 'm surprised the ruhrpott is doing so badly , given that it 's the industrial heart of germany . 
  79 % including some lucky guesses, 
  ... jet fuel ? 
  breaking news !, 
  germans have ` limited contact ' with azerbaijani , north koreans and aliens from mars !, 
  experts believe this stems from the low representation of these demographics within germany [ citation needed ], 
  and now from all the reddit clicks the newspaper will think that this is a massive story that needs 24h coverage . 
  i prefer the revolutionary mega man . 
  it 's more fun to see neighboring and overlapping themes integrate with each other in unique ways . 
  give you something to see which you have n't before . 
  i bet he 'll find a backwards way to ban them too . 
  something like ` non-smoking gay couples with pet allergies who hate musicals ', 
   single parents , workers on low incomes , families with children , pet owners , smokers and single adults are also among those who mr wilson has barred from his properties .
