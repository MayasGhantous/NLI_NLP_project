  i do n't know the outcome of that addition but if vat is 21 % in france too ( as it it here in the nl ) then out of the 25 of the money he has left he has to fork over another 4 % of his income as taxes putting the real amount of tax he pays a lot higher . 
   have you ever in your life played amateur football , or seen what ethnicity the hooligans at professional football ? 
  i guess not . 
  actually yes , for about 15 years now . 
  in rotterdam no less so i have seen * exactly * where the prejudice against moroccans comes from . 
  i have played against teams of only `` white farmers '' without incident ; exclusively turks , again without incident and teams that had one or more moroccan players , often * with incidents * . 
  the players are pricks , the fathers beside the field are pricks too . 
  one of the reasons you could tell this teams apart as `` allochtoon '' is the randomness and the level of violence , always it 's the fights with the moroccan kids that go way too far , most fights between these `` white farmers '' you describe end after one or two swings and a few curse words , i have yet to see one of them kick someone in the face when they 're already down , that requires a special level of depravity . 
   so what exactly are people not publicizing here ? 
  newspapers need to report the relevant facts , and anyone who has spend time in their youth at the field knows that immigrants really are not the exception when it comes to violence . 
  they publish * yet another * incident of extreme behavior by these moroccan kids . 
  had they been surinamese or chinese i doubt it would have been reported . 
  people are just sick of this crap . 
  of course they are , any dutch person reading that sentence mouthed the word . 
  as politically incorrect as it apparently may be the moroccans in the netherlands are a troubled and problematic group in many respects . 
  it 's not * your * language , it ours . 
  you guys chose to be independent , remember ? 
  i hate people like you , you move to amsterdam and project your bs ideas ( which you base entirely on amsterdammers ) on the dutch . 
  if you ca n't be bothered to make an effort to get to know the country you moved to it 'd be nice if you at least had the goddamn common courtesy to shut up about it to others in stead of making us sound bad . 
   please stay at home . 
  you too , i doubt anyone would miss you . 
  hold on , the dutch have always spoken germanic languages but never a `` german dialect '' .

  130 m \u00b2 is not a tiny house ... 
  it 's because our country is so fucking expensive . 
  i 'm always stunned at how fast my money is spent at the end of the month , especially when i compare my income to incomes in the rest of the eu ... 
  i always feel rich when i travel to eastern european countries like the czech republic or greece , 
  you should have seen me in civ4 and civ5 , every game ended with me nuking everybody !, 
  why 's that ? 
  a nato flag , a swastika and a muslim together in one battalion ... 
  i have no idea what to think of this . 
   even fewer want to merge with the netherlands thank god , i 've seen belgium and its people a couple of times now and to be honest i 'm fine with all that being in a different country . 
  the aa is also the first step on the road to integration of ukraine into the eu ... my biggest problem with the aa is that it serves to further an american agenda of expansion towards and possibly eventually * into * russia ( seriously read zbigniew brzezinski 's `` the grand chessboard '' for more ) . 
  the interests of the eu are much better suited with a range of buffer nations between us and russia . 
  as far as i can tell ukraine is a completely corrupt failed state with an equally failed economy . 
  we ca n't even handle trying to get a small country like greece to behave normally so i really ca n't see how we could possibly get ukraine out of the crapper . 
  especially with a neighbor like russia constantly fucking things up . 
  i 'm in favor of a prosperous , well led eu and i think we have a better chance of getting there if we stop letting troubled countries in for a while . 
  we 've all seen over the last decade that the eu has a lot of flaws that need to get fixed and i think that 's hard enough with the countries we already have . 
  i know it 's sad for the people of ukraine who rebelled waving their eu flags but in the end it makes no real difference to any of the things i just wrote . 
  ** the ** hague . 
  the city is called '' ** the ** hague '' . 
  better yet , `` den haag '' . 
  oh please , `` the truth '' my ass . 
  the belgians are a sour people who will take any opportunity to complain about the dutch just to keep people from taking a good look at belgium . 
  nobody cares what you think , this is / r/europe . 
  plenty of people care what one of the most senior members of the ec has to say . 
  crucial is the caveat :  by the ( admittedly low ) standards in my previous post . 
  i 'm by no means denying the man is a despot , it 's obvious that he is . 
  all i 'm saying is that there are far worse dictators out there and this one is n't the worst one we 've sold weapons to . 
   he absolutely is and his record is just as bad as assad 's ** was before the civil war began ** . 
  making your statement pointless in six words . 
  assad inherited his power which means he did n't have to murder thousands to get to power like sisi did . 
  as soon as the civil war began assad murdered people at a rate mubarak ( sisi 's predecessor and a reasonable comparison ) never achieved during the arab spring . 
  like it or not , egypt , with all it 's many flaws , is a * comparitively * stable and `` peaceful '' ( for lack of a better word ) dictatorship compared to the rest of africa and the middle east . 
   mass murdering dictator by the ( admittedly low ) standards of dictators in the middle east i think this is a * bit * of an exaggeration . 
  egypt needs a decent navy because the have a lot of sea and the suez channel to protect from outside threats like human traffickers and israel . 
  think what you will about israel but they can definitely be trouble for a country like egypt which has a right to protect itself like any other country . 
  the fear , at least here in the netherlands , was that if france and germany might unite too much on certain issues they would trump all other nations in europe . 
  at the time spain and italy were not very impressive and the uk was . 
  so to avoid situations of germany and france trampling the rest ( particularly us because we 're caught in the middle ) it seemed wise to have a third power of comparable scale to the `` big two '' in play . 
  the inclusion of the uk means germany and france will not always be working together ( because they could team up with the other power ) and sows a sufficient amount of division that the dreaded `` league of two '' would not come to divide europe between them . 
  even though italy and spain have grown they tend to be politically unstable to such a degree that they rarely make a real fist in the eu which means the power balance between the uk , france and germany still mostly holds true and the uk still needed to prevent germany and france from dictating their will in europe . 
   this is bs . 
  germany has stated several times that they do not want to lead the eu . 
  but when shit hits the fan everyone 's looking at them , waiting for a direction/solution . 
  and afterwards they start complaining how germany `` forcefully grabbed power '' . 
  is it really ? 
  it was n't primarily the german minister of finance who attempted to dictate fiscal policy for greece during the financial crisis ? 
  was n't it the german chancellor who decided europe wanted to shelter hundreds of thousands of refugees ( without first consulting the leaders of the rest of europe ) ? 
  is n't the repeated suggestion to punish eu nations that refuse to give in to german demands for distribution of the refugees * germany invited * coming from germany ? 
  give me a break , germany is absolutely going for control in the eu now that france and the uk sidelined themselves and they 're not being particularly subtle about it either . 
   if the other eu states dont want germany to be the leader they probably should stop sitting on their hands waiting for germany to do something and then complain about it ( while still sitting on their hands ) . 
  [ we 're trying !, 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/netherlands-suggests-only-refugees-registered-near-war-zones-be-relocated-1.2345883 ) but it 's certainly no easier now that german politicians have unilaterally decided what the eu `` needs to do '' . 
  when it was up for debate if the uk should be asked to join the eu , the netherlands was very much in favor of it as a counterbalance to the germans and the french . 
  now france is as good as quiet on all things with a weak , ineffectual president and a faltering economy ; the uk spends its time freaking out about `` threats from abroad '' and looks for an idyllic past that never was and germany grabbed power after an economical quirk of faith put them in a good position at the start of the last crisis . 
  the delicate balance of power in the eu is upset and effects are immediately visible with , for example , germany inviting refugees and then forcing them on everyone else . 
  the combination of germany forcefully grabbing power ( still a sensitive point in much of europe ) and the german attitude to the refugee crisis sounds almost like the perfect storm with regard to a brexit . 
  i ca n't help but wonder if the brexit is the german objective here . 
  i think it 's just the logical progression of reddit in general devolving towards the mean . 
  this subreddit has gone full strormfront ... 
  because we are not the barbaric peoples of the arabian peninsula ? 
  i do n't get why poland wants to play with the big boys if it is n't prepared to play the part . 
  helping refugees is a human obligation because it 's the right fucking thing to do . 
  if you were displaced by violence you would also hope for a place to go and poland is now one of those places for people from syria . 
  it 's time the former soviet countries stopped being so fucking pathetic and took their place among the rich , developed nations . 
  part of that role is definitely helping those in need . 
  i 'm not talking about those left wanting economically , i 'm talking about people who would die in their countries of origin . 
  yeah because when one dickhead in western europe says something nasty he speaks for all of us ... fuck that guy for making such comments and fuck you for making yours . 
  easy there buddy , some german a-hole said this . 
  not all of us !, 
  love from holland . 
  i 'd love a bro punch from juncker !, 
   because of such things eu is perceived more as total failure than the noble saviour , as you seem to believe . 
  i do n't believe the eu is * perceived * as a `` noble savior '' , i believe that 's what it * could be * if people stopped treating it like a fucking cash cow . 
  i hate seeing our only chance at a rich future go to hell because so many people are too short-sighted to see what the eu * could become * in stead of * what it is * . 
  a grant is not a loan , to the best of my knowledge the eu does n't lend money . 
  how does subsidy lead to debt exactly ?
