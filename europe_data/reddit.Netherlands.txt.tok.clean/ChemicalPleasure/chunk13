  the netherlands , 18 for all alcohol . 
  birthdays , football games , fridays ( some thursdays too , fuck it ) , [ koningsdag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koningsdag ) etc. 
  you go out with your mates and drink beer , pilsener to be specific . 
  stupid belgian beersnobs will tell you pilsener is `` water '' and more of such nonsense but in reality after the first two pretty much any reasonable brand pilsener will do . 
  belgian beer is made for `` one or two '' which is for grandpas and pussies , dutch beer is optimized so you can slam it hard all night and only vomit when you get home . 
  on particularly good evenings we will order [ bitterballen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bitterballen ) to go with the beer , bitterballen are small spherical croquettes and quite probably the absolute pinacle of dutch cuisine . 
  many older people drink [ jenever ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jenever ) which is the dutch version of gin . 
  jenever is drunk like belgian beer if you 're old or occasionally in a 1-2 combo with a beer in which case it 's called a `` kopstoot '' which means `` headbutt '' . 
  [ wine ] ( http://www.spoelenmaar.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/french-stereotype.jpg ) is also drunk but more typically with a meal or by women and salonsocalists . 
  so are we , for laughing . 
  thus losing roughly 99.95 % of its appeal . 
   some people would rather let homeless syrian children die than risk not being able to afford the $ 2,000 flat screen tv and having to settle for the $ 1,900 one . 
  [ yeah because that 's the only choice ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/false_dichotomy ) . 
  / s how about we accept that there is suffering in the world without immediately overshooting and giving the shirts off our backs ? 
  i 'm supportive of the notion that we should help others * if we reasonable can * . 
  i 'm not in favor of giving so much away that it hurts us here and considering the numbers we can expect to come from africa and the middle east in the coming decades that might well end up happening . 
  aside from the financial aspect i 'm also deeply distrusting of the refugees we might import . 
  once they get settled in they 'll be just like the other arabic migrants we already have who refuse to integrate and cause decades of trouble . 
  we already made that mistake once and i really do n't see why we should do it a second time . 
  we have a duty to our women , gays , unbelievers etc. 
  to protect them and judging by the stances typically taken by the 2nd and 3rd generations of the previous immigration waves they would be considerably worse off if we let tens of thousands of syrians settle here . 
  downvote simply for the use of the `` word '' `` m8 ' . 
  let 's try to maintain what little standards we have here . 
  in france there are apparently enough farmers to close down and damage highways and to steal and destroy other people 's goods . 
  in fact i can recall that france apparently has so many farmers that the police * ca n't do anything about them when they destroy other people 's stuff !, 
  i think the bet solution for the uk would be to close all borders , leave the eu , put fences and landmines on the beaches , collapse the channel tunnel and just go it alone from now on . 
  / s the tories can have their victorian idyll for all i care . 
  of course i do n't know you but it looks like you may have contributed a bit to your own unhappiness there . 
  that happens of course , i myself am moving across the country by the end of the year . 
  that 's because it 's awesome here . 
  he does n't have to do anything , you asked him for his opinion !, 
   more a ` problem ' the western world in general is having . 
  yeah ... no . 
  none , absolutely none of my dutch friends have left this country because they felt some `` need '' to . 
  disappointingly our royals are * incredibly * popular here . 
  and bullshit , they live lives of luxury . 
  i think it 's more reasonable to say everybody in the eu has contributed to the current situation of political weakness . 
  france is economically losing to germany and will bend the rules to avoid trouble . 
  germany is has a huge trade surplus and will bend the rules to maintain it because it 's economically forced to . 
  eastern and southern europe are too corrupt which makes for a poor investment climate resulting in a constant need for deficit spending beyond the european rules and the uk will try to hamstring any attempt to reign in the financial markets because the city is too important for the british gdp . 
  to limit the relative power of the german economy after reunification france insisted on a currency union which resulted in the euro . 
  not some lofty ideal or some sort of long-term vision which is why we 're now struggling with the resulting mess . 
  it 's high time a few leaders arose that impose policy that includes a long term vision that benefits the entire eu . 
  all alternatives will result in increased poverty and internal and external political instability . 
  it was agreed upon at some point in this sub that since most europeans use some variety of `` europ ** a ** '' it should be what we call the continent rather than `` europ ** e ** '' . 
  think of that what you will . 
  i wish . 
  happened to me too , closest i ever came to punching someone in face on vacation . 
  i have to agree , i 've also been to both and i did n't like turkey at all . 
  the people were unpleasant and clingy and only out for my money . 
  the countryside was pretty but nothing special . 
  food-wise i 'm not crazy about either , both too fat , too much meat . 
  at least the people in greece are nice . 
  [ you might consider this informative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tu_quoque ) . 
  i 've been to the uk and i 've seen you guys , i would n't be surprised if moonburn was a real thing in the uk . 
  and that submarine was built in the netherlands !, 
  there 's no substitute for quality . 
  i rarely upvote a post simply because of the title but this really is a great one . 
  because language is the tool we use to describe reality and reality is a changing evolving thing . 
  the way we observe reality is affected and shaped by the language we use to describe it which means that a changing mood ( a `` zeitgeist '' if you will ) requires co-changing language . 
  essentially its a question of allowing ourselves to have the right tool for the job . 
  the crisis and the resulting advice given out by economists in 2008 show that the combination of economists , other peoples ' money and statistics is probably unwise . 
  often , yes . 
  because we 're not born into some sort of vacuum . 
  we are born into families , peoples , traditions etc. 
  that we can choose to be a part of . 
  it is not strange or illogical to choose to be a part of something greater than ourselves and find pride in it . 
  the achievements of earlier generations of dutch are something i am proud of because i identify as dutch . 
  we should party sometime . 
  there 's always a sourpuss that ca n't be proud of anything . 
  for a country that opposes homosexuality these guys are surprisingly gay . 
  nothing unites like a common enemy , i guess that makes serbia a very useful country . 
  thanks serbia and russia !, 
  ( belarus is just a vassal , they do n't count ) . 
  yeah !, 
  how is it not obvious that the only way out of this crisis is more free money from northern europe ? 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  those things are like heroin ... on crack, 
  considering how many people complained that the policies imposed on greece were `` political and not based in economics '' it sure is fun to see how often economic forecasts turn out to be wrong . 
  back then we were going to order more i believe . 
  also the man who replaced pim fortuyn , a guy called mat herben , immediately made 180 and supported purchasing the f35 . 
  somethin fortuyn was strongly opposed to . 
  after he left politics herben became a full-time lobbyist for the jsf . 
  to make matters even weirder herben is a freemason , obviously this does n't help to dispel any conspiracy theories ... 
  there was a lot of weird shit happening around fortuyn and although i doubt the cia was in on it i do n't doubt many were n't exactly sorry about his murder . 
  aside from the annoyance at the fact that there are now women who can grow better beards than i i really do n't feel anything other than utter , blank apathy . 
  as if some floating village in the sea is * remotely comparable * with a 10m population nation in the eu . 
  yeah fuck them for not just throwing more of their tax payers money into the pit !, 
  how dare they, 
  why the hell should a simple looking watch like that be that expensive ? 
  yes , good chemistry education and an entrepreneurial spirit . 
  so how about we stop sending money from zuid-holland to groningen then ? 
  if that 's how it works !, 
  the eu is outside of turkey and vise versa . 
  let 's keep it that way . 
   a lot more modest , reserved and honest than dutch people . 
  oh please !, 
  the modesty is usually false , the reservation only as long until you walk out and the gossip begins and as for honesty i ca n't even guess where you 're getting that from . 
  it certainly makes little sense to call us outspoken and dishonest at the same time , it 's not a logical match . 
  you just sound like another one of those inexplicably sour belgians to me .
