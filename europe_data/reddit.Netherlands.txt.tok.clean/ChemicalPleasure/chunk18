  how 's polish general opinion on the dutch ? 
  you were doing well enough and then you just made it so obvious . 
  not sure if you 're being facetious ... 
  it does , the provinces north - and south holland ( noord - en zuid-holland ) have a combined population of ~ 6.2 m. 
  the country called `` the netherlands '' ( usually referred to using the * pars pro toto * `` holland '' ) comprised a total population of 16.877.351 ( in 2014 ) . 
  that 's a larger population than belgium , greece , the czech republic , portugal , hungary , sweden , austria , bulgaria , denmark , finland , slovakia , ireland , croatia , lithuania , slovenia , latvia , estonia , cyprus , luxembourg and malta . 
  there are more dutch than the peoples of the last eight countries in that list combined . 
  17 million people is n't tiny . 
  only in proving that a man 's lifelong career of working with both men and women need not necessarily result in him actually learning to work with both men * and women * . 
  men and women are equal but not the same , to try and use the communicative methods that work for men with women is always going to give mixed results at best , just like overly feminine communication works poorly with most men . 
  in fact in the natural sciences it 's pretty much a given for the top-tier professors to also be known as complete assholes . 
  leave it to the belgians to get salty over any dutch achievement . 
  in other news ; the guardian is wrecking english to create title . 
  nope . 
  the term you 're looking for is `` spin-forbidden transitions '' . 
  agreed , looks cool . 
  technically that 's phosphorescence . 
  the basic difference is not entirely straightforward to explain but it comes down to it that fluorescence occurs almost immediately whereas phosphorescence is a much slower process . 
  fluorescence ends pretty much as soon as the excitation source ( typically a uv light ) is removed whereas phosphorescence will continue for minutes or even hours . 
  serbia , helping europe show its bad side since 1914 . 
  seriously , it would be nice to hear something positive about or from serbia for a change . 
   and the states are closer economically to each other than that the member states of the eurozone . 
  [ like hell they are ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_gdp#/media/file:comparison_between_u.s._states_and_countries_by_gdp_in_2012.jpg ) . 
  federal taxes are additional to state taxes , those are still to be determined by the states individually and fiscal transfers are taken care of via federal taxation . 
  the workforce in the eu is effectively equally mobile to that of the usa . 
  why ? 
  the usa is a currency union and their state taxes are left up to the states themselves , works fine for them . 
  the debate is impopular in any european country that does n't want the eu to dictate tax policy on a national level . 
  why should he suddenly change his mind on the subject ? 
  national taxes are a policy area that should remain on a national level which includes the freedom to set taxes as high or low as any individual nation pleases . 
  if this is how greeks do business i can kind of see where the crisis came from . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  train transport is great for business so why the hell would the imf be against it ? 
  in confused , which claims are you talking about ? 
  excellent . 
   ** kanker ** internet easy there . 
  that word really is not to be used lightly . 
  i 'm actually in favor of further integration , i just ca n't stand schulz . 
  if you want a * light * - version of the roma experience you should go to rome or barcelona and see for yourself . 
  you might come away with a certain understanding of the pan-european dislike for the roma . 
  i 'm not saying it 's good but it sure is understandable . 
  you sound like a pleasant person to talk to . 
   5/10 , would rather be in the netherlands . 
  d'aaaaaaaw < 3, 
   `` the other two did not participate much , '' he explained . 
  `` one [ donald tusk , president of the european council ] is not interested , ** and the other [ jeroen dijssoelbloem , president of the eurogroup ] is too afraid to get involved ** , '' he said . 
  god i dislike martin schulz . 
  just because someone refuses to join in an idea ( probably because this idea is n't necessarily in the general interest of countries other than germany and france ) this antidemocrat will sucker punch him in the media . 
  so we can all sit in the fucking cold when the wc happens . 
  that 'll be a blast , rain and sleet outside , shitty overheated football inside . 
   afaik lots of europeans travel to dubai already then you do n't know `` very far '' . 
  i know literally * no * people from europe who traveled to qatar for anything other than work . 
  good reason for that too , it 's not a good place for anything . 
  `` go to the beach '' ?!, 
  seriously ? 
  in a country where the exposure of skin is criminal for women and frowned upon for men ? 
  where alcohol is not served and the sand is hot enough to fry eggs ?!, 
  no thanks . 
  i can shop anywhere ; take a boat on the mediterranean and enjoy arab food pretty much in any large european city or even jordan * before i 'd even * consider * going to qatar . 
  let 's face it , the greek insolvency could have been solved a lot faster if a more cooperative attitude had been adopted in the eurozone . 
  it was a choice of the german government in particular to take a harsh line with greece and to employ rhetoric that the greeks would never accept . 
  this crisis could have been subdued much earlier by a limited degree of quantitative easing but instead it was driven to its extreme . 
  you have to wonder why that was choice was made . 
  now we can see that the `` endgame '' ( in so many words ... ) was to push for further eu integration . 
  such drastic measures would never stand * any * chance without some heat and pressure to make things fluid . 
  now there is a crisis that threatens the eu as a whole and a radical proposal to install the `` embryo '' of a federal eu government , a proposal that , if only successful in the slightest degree , with radically alter the course of the eu . 
  what i referred to hastily as a `` greek debt project '' basically amounts to my feeling that the french and particularly german governments purposefully used the greek crisis to their advantage by carefully letting it evolve to the point we are at today . 
  are you implying politicians are above/incapable of using a crisis to their advantage ? 
  we 'll see about that , the urgency certainly is n't felt the same way here in the netherlands and i have a hunch we 're not the only ones who are less enthusiastic . 
  at least this shows us what the endgame of the inexplicable `` greek debt project '' was . 
  til , so even that is n't the case anymore . 
  thank you . 
  there is . 
  and that 's fine , it keeps the vaccine from spoiling and is in such a low dose that it causes no ill effects to the human body . 
  even if it did it could well be that the effects of the mercury are orders of magnitude less than those of the diseases that are prevented by the vaccines . 
  it is n't even the correct systematic name . 
  for future reference the correct , systematic name of water is * oxidane * . 
  also your views on the relative safety of natural materials and products are fundamentally flawed . 
  you forget that everything in nature can be deconstructed into hundreds of separate pure chemicals , to know the effects of a single chemical is obviously more realistic than to know the effects of the individual components of a natural product . 
  this is especially true for medicines which are studied in extreme depth before they go to market . 
  the same is absolutely not the case for natural products for the reasons i just stated . 
  the simple fact is that even the `` safe '' natural products are often found to be mildly toxic at some point , this goes for everything from wood to tea/coffee and even flame grilled meat ( how natural can you get after all ) . 
  also your ( flawed ) reasoning can be taken as support for a misguided and very dangerous `` popular '' tendency to forgo vaccination . 
  please be mindful of your responsibility , you may have the right to voice your ideas but that does n't mean they have no effects on people . 
  `` yay !, 
  they noticed us ! '', 
  i honestly ca n't tell if you 're joking or just completely unaware of history . 
  judging by your general stance on the eu i 'm going to go with the latter . 
  now there 's something we can all be sad about ... 
  not really , it depends entirely on the cultivar . 
  some are better and some are worse . 
  the varieties are grown with specific purposes in mind and sometimes get used the wrong way . 
  also the beer looks kind of white . 
  my idea is that the word `` witbier '' makes perfect sense . 
  dutch here , german is ok , just archaic dutch really . 
  french on the other hand is fucking * h\u00e4sslich * . 
  orban is being criticized endlessly . 
  also being called a dictator by one one the highest ranking politicians of the eu * on camera * is a pretty big deal !, 
  i love juncker . 
  everybody is making a huge deal out of this and overinterpreting everything like this is america .
