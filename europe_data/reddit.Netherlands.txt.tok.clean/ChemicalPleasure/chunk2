  i 'm dutch and i do n't even like it ... 
  it 's too slow and in the modern era it makes no sense . 
  i know the words used to have a different meaning but to sing that we 're germans who honour the spanish crown is just ridiculous nowadays . 
  yes , by its own police no less . 
  actually this does n't look european at all . 
  the houses look brand new . 
  i love it too but i hate that we always get the lamest pictures of our country . 
  there are things that are much prettier and impressive in the netherlands . 
  also , there are things that are not amsterdam : /, 
  dude !, 
  our time to shine !, 
  oliebollen are clearly the best . 
  that looks much better ... 
  you 'll still be number two at best . 
  the pictures of the dutch examples in these series appear to be universally awful . 
  here are some better pictures of leiden university ... [ law faculty ] ( http://www.studyinholland.co.uk/images/universities/kogsmall_000%20take%20this.jpg ) [ the old academy building where phd 's defend and new professors orate ] ( http://www.roosevelt.nl/topics/roosevelt/about_rsc/network/leiden_university/leiden2.jpg ) [ the medical research facility ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/onderzoeksgebouw_lumc_leiden.jpg ) [ the restored observatory ] ( http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/summerstudents/sumstud2.jpg ) [ and the library where students congregate to drink coffee and flirt ] ( http://www.brandeis.edu/abroad/brandeisprograms/hague/summer/images/bicycles.jpg ) . 
  it 's ridiculous !, 
  op could have used [ this one ] ( http://hollandamericaclub.com/fallstamppot2012/boerenkool.jpg ) , or [ this one ] ( http://www.culinette.nl/wp-images/stamppotsnij.jpg ) , or [ this one ] ( http://a2.att.hudong.com/56/90/19300448802438133145908787637.jpg ) , or [ this one ] ( http://www.refdag.nl/polopoly_fs/stamppot_1_518758!image/3112115306.jpg ) or [ this one ] ( http://www.unox.nl/sites/default/files/imagecache/big_image_user_article/news/foto_bij_ontstaan_van_de_stamppot.jpg ) but in stead he/she chose the one where it 's just slopped on the plate carelessly ... goddamnit op !, 
  i notice someone snuck turkey in as well . 
  it seems like he ordered the downing of mh17 ( as best as we will ever know probably ) . 
  i hope he dies slowly . 
  that sounds wildly inefficient anyway , i think we 'd be better off with wind and tidal power . 
  hopefully also fusion power some day ... 
  afaik it has gas for another decade or two , there is also the issue of people 's houses being damaged because of subsidence in the ground caused by the extraction of the gas . 
  not to mention the fact that the gas terminal could be used to receive and distribute gas while we still have gas of our own , it 's still a profitable trade , especially now . 
  we have a huge one in the port of rotterdam now for when out own gas runs out . 
  in the meantime it would be good if we figured out some way to store energy from solar and wind power . 
  if we can do that we 're pretty much set , we could fill the gaps with gas we ship in from other parts of the world . 
  this is why solar and wind are worth more than just their financial benefits . 
  the less gas we need the sooner we can rid ourselves entirely of the russians . 
  if we make a push for it and install as many panels as possible we can make a huge dent in russian exports . 
  the people who put that flag up do n't seem to realize what tends to happen in europe when bigotry and hate are fed ... we are n't going anywhere good with this . 
  an underclass has been created that consists of the ( children of ) muslim immigrants who feel left out . 
  often that feeling is justified which makes them turn away from society which reinforces the sunning they loathed to begin with . 
  the way things are looking militant islam might well be the `` only way out '' for many of them . 
  like i said , this is n't going anywhere good . 
  oh honestly fuck off !, 
  austerity is not a synonym for fascism . 
  it is the basic concept that you do not spend what you do n't have and that not all luxury is affordable . 
  stop trying to convince people of a lie and face up to the fact that greece fucked up and stop blaming the rest of the world . 
  this is like a heroin addict blaming everyone around him for his problems . 
  you should visit rome . 
  i 'm dutch and i love my country but rome is simply the best capital city in europe imho . 
  you 're right but there are some people in this world for whom conflict is the only way forward . 
  playing nice with the russians evidently does not work . 
  oh wow this looks like the russian sanctions are really going to hurt !, 
  $ 16bn is $ 11.98 bn . 
  that 's not even 0.1 % of our gdp . 
  russia stands to lose much more , they will have to pay more for * their food * now . 
  also there is already a capital flight from russia going on and no such thing is happening in the eu . 
  nor is it likely to happen any time soon . 
  to paraphrase a famous russian : `` we will be there to bury them '' . 
  [ cpi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index ) disagrees with you . 
  having driven on the belgian highways and having seen the state of the overpasses and bridges i 'm pretty sure i 'm not . 
  also i think you underestimate dutch infrastructure . 
  to be honest i really do n't see why we should want flanders . 
  bringing the infrastructure up to dutch standards would cost billions upon billions . 
  not to mention weeding out the corrupt politicians which would take decades and probably sour relations with the flemish long before the end would be in sight . 
  you those occasions when you 're laughing but you should n't be laughing ... 
   never forget . 
  not forgetting is not the same as never shutting up about it . 
  especially against people who have nothing at all to do with it ( hell even their parents had nothing to do with it ) . 
  do us all a favour and join us in the 21st century , please . 
  well there 's always the greek model where you vote for a corrupt politician so that he 'll give you a job or make sure you wo n't ever lose the job you have and he then spends all your money and borrows a bunch more which he also steals . 
  there 's that too . 
  i prefer austerity . 
  no better way to stop piracy than 16 attack helicopters and a control room . 
  bit iffy on the human rights but nobody seems to care about those anymore anyway . . 
  if there 's one stereotype i 'm thoroughly sick of it 's this . 
  the eu+us+c anada represent roughly half of the world 's combined gdp ( 48.7 % according to the imf in 2013 ) . 
  the brics nations represent 21.3 % . 
  russia 's exports are also not equally divided globally ( logically ) , 51.8 % of russian exports go the eu alone while slightly less than 30 % goes to asia and only 2.1 % goes to the usa . 
  in other words european sanctions alone can do massive damage to the russian economy . 
  compared to the 2.1 % of russian exports that go to the usa the eu is essentially doing all of the work which explains why the americans are so eager to impose sanctions while the eu is much more reticent . 
  if only the russians had known how much of a grudge we can carry ... 
  imagine if we would have to listen to the inane comments of the mp 's of all the other european nations as much as we do the uk 's mp 's . 
  this subreddit would drown in the stupidity . 
  any examples ? 
  seems to me like soviet-era material does not constitute `` better equipment '' . 
  probably not which will put extra distance between the kremlin and some of the people with power in russia . 
  divide and rule . 
  yes , yes it is . 
  it would have been nice to see some support from germany but instead merkel just said talking to putin is always the best idea ... his men had just killed an airliner full of civilians ffs !, 
  she makes no effort to support ukraine or the eastern european nation in the face of a dangerous , imperialist russia . 
  the german government and people need to face up to the reality that as the strongest nation they should take the lead in europe . 
  without it the eu is a pointless institution . 
  even germany did nothing to support dutch efforts in the past few days . 
  it 's clear that this union is not as tight knit as we hoped it to be . 
  when even our closest and best neighbor leaves us hanging i think we should take care of ourselves first more often in the future . 
  apparently that 's all the eu really is when it comes down to it . 
  the mayor who said this just explained on tv that he said this after meeting with several families who had lost relatives in mh17 . 
  his excuse was that he 's only human and i agree with him . 
  i knew no-one in mh17 and i 'm furious , i can only imagine how it must feel after spending a day with grieving relatives . 
  the idea is senseless but the emotion is understandable , perhaps we should n't pay too much attention to emotional responses after such an incident . 
  i was wondering why everybody kept harping on about `` russian shills on reddit '' . 
  it 's good to finally see one for real . 
  if mh-17 shows us anything it 's that befriending russia is the wrong way to go . 
  russia must be subdued and democratized through any means possible , the alternative of peaceful cooperation is clearly not viable . 
  to suggest that a nation like germany would ally russia is to suggest the germans are blind to the obvious reality of russian politics . 
  russia is an aspiring empire and not a democratic or humane one either .
