  a good way to go about things is to simply outgrow the americans . 
  there is no chance that we will get by on our own without a solid economic base which we are in the process of forming right now . 
  let the problems surrounding the euro , corruption , democratic representation and common policies for defense , energy and agriculture play out first . 
  by the time we get those things sorted out the newer eu countries will have started developing . 
  look at poland for a nice example of economic dynamism and romania for a good example of a country bettering itself in the face of corruption for instance . 
  while we consolidate our union we 'd do best to accept our role as an american protectorate because it serves us well . 
  please realize that the eu is a relatively young institution , these processes take decades easily and european integration has only just gotten underway . 
  you forgot an s. reich ** s ** plan europa . 
  [ their leader ] ( http://afa.home.xs4all.nl/alert/1_13/plaatjes/duo.jpg ) is comedy gold . 
  bit of good news once in a while . 
  or maybe a region in eastern ukraine meant nothing to use in return for a degree of dominion over the rest of ukraine . 
  russia is not that interesting , it 's a shithole . 
  russia is poor and overly eager to assert itself , they were in a position of power because of the gas and now , because of a particularly fortuitous turn of events in the middle east their power is broken . 
  we 're doing alright and eastern europe ( the bits in the eu , the parts that count for as far as i/we care ) is safer than ever . 
  edit . 
  rambling , i 'm leaving it that way . 
   i think a referendum could end up being good for the uk 's relationship with the eu . 
  yeah right ... let 's hear you spew your gall about the eu for a solid year and see how it improves our relationship . 
  edit . 
  fucking typical , say anything contrary to the uk point of view and the downvotes come instantly . 
  the flowers are nice . 
  unless the uk has an interest to be * all in * i 'd rather see the uk * all out * . 
  this two speed crap is more than annoying , it 's getting in the way of europe 's shot at greatness . 
  we need people willing to go for it in stead of this constant coy-play . 
  if that 's too much for our british friends i 'd be alright with a successful eu with a more or less unaffiliated island neighbor . 
  they were in the sense that there is ( because of a democratic deficit in british politics caused by the fptp system ) a relatively large group of people who feel unheard . 
  leading a life that you feel like you ca n't control is very insecure and leads to tensions . 
  i believe the london riots were a release of tension among the disenfranchised lower class of the uk . 
  obviously these are by nature not politically inclined people but the situation they are in certainly is a consequence of politics . 
  to be honest i do n't think the uk is a country where democracy ever got a proper foothold anyway . 
  of all european nations i think the uk is the most clearly class-oriented which is reflected by a political system that heavily favors power remaining in the hands of a small elite . 
  it gives stability but it costs credibility . 
  i was n't surprised by the london riots a couple of years ago , it seems like a logical thing for the disenfranchised to occasionally burst into violence . 
  that does n't make it right and they were n't very political about things but that there is a large number of people who simply are n't heard in the uk is obvious . 
  people that realistically were n't going to vote conservative anyway . 
  it was a good strategy to follow and it worked . 
  let 's remind them then . 
   no french person ( includes belgians ) should ever live in a country where the dutch are in the majority , the horror !, 
  we fully agree . 
  we do n't want wallonia ( either ? 
  ) , only the dutch part . 
  he 's not really a `` lawmaker '' though . 
  nobody will ever form a coalition with him so he wo n't be making any laws anytime soon . 
  he 's basically a attentionwhoring lunatic , let 's not feed that . 
  / r/circlejerk is somewhere else . 
  if properly trained , equipped and dug in ( they had time ) the city should be almost impossible to take . 
  it 's known that training was supplied from the west , humvees were supplied as well , probably with comms equipment , hopefully with spotting radars and other useful equipment too . 
  we 'll probably never learn the full extent of outside involvement but it 's likely to be substantial . 
  the ceasefire was a beautiful opportunity to quietly funnel weapons into the area from both sides . 
  i hope the russians were n't the only ones to take advantage . 
  let 's call it slovakoczechia this time !, 
  i would n't be surprised if that exact thing has been proposed during the vietnam war . 
   it 's ** pretty much ** never reasonable to nuke a nation . 
  in my mind it 's a bit like a streetfight , there is no excuse for violence until someone attacks you , from that point onward there is no reason , just survival . 
  to attack a nuclear nation is dumb , to attack a nuclear nation while in a pact with another nuclear power is suicidal because your pact raises the stakes to a nuclear level . 
  so , as russia is a nuclear power in a pact ( apparently ) with argentina * against * the uk . 
  does this mean it 's now reasonable to use nuclear weapons against argentina in the event of another invasion ? 
  refusal to be an integral part of the schengen area even though pretty much everyone else considers it to be a cornerstone of european integration ; the rebate ; the insistence on an opt-out clause in the maastricht treaty ; refusal to join the euro ; far above average no-votes in the council of ministers etc. 
  not a single thing passes in the eu without some sort of fuss from the uk . 
  a good example is cameron 's embarrassment of a speech on 23 january 2013 in which he demands of the eu that it becomes an `` a la carte '' union in which countries can form separate little unions on specific issues , in which many of the powers devolved to the eu are returned to the separate nations ; for eu market regulations not to impede trade with non-eu nations and for `` less regulation in general '' ( implying that there is too much eu regulation and that eu regulations are by definition bad ) . 
  these requirements fly directly in the face of further eu integration which is what pretty much every nation in the eu strives for except , as the aforementioned examples show , the uk . 
  so no , your callous dismissal of criticism * vs * . 
  the uk is not `` entire [ sic ] rhetoric '' and is founded on facts . 
   consider that the end of the eu meh , i 'm not convinced that it would be . 
  it would certainly be the end of the eu * in its current form * . 
  reforming the eu would probably pick up speed from both the increased urgency and the lack of a country that constantly runs interference . 
  possibly a few other countries would leave as well , i strongly doubt france would be one of them though . 
  as long as france and germany are unified we 'll be ok . and as long as fr and de are unified the benelux will be part of the same union just because we 're kind of in the middle in every way . 
  the presence of fr , de and benelux will make the block large and powerful enough to be attractive to countries like poland , bulgaria , romania and the baltic nations ( who 's only alternative are the reviled russians ) . 
  in other words , i strongly doubt the logic behind the * end of the eu * . 
  if isds were really anything special ( which it 's not ) you could argue that 0.9 % total additional growth was n't worth it . 
  i think it mostly comes down to people not understanding what isds is for and that their countries are usually already party to a multitude of treaties that include isds . 
  depending on your frame of reference i suppose it could be ... 
  if this shows anything it 's that the noise in the `` signal '' is huge . 
  personally i do n't think the uk would leave , i also think that that 's a real shame . 
  how does that make sense ?!, 
  is the genocide of the armenians by the turks somehow different when it 's called a genocide by other genocidal maniacs ? 
  if this were wikipedia your last statement would get a well deserved [ citation needed ] . 
  a divided europe would be bankrupted and bought one by one by the chinese , americans and russians . 
  there would be no sovereignty then . 
  much better then to realize that the world will consist of a few all-powerful nations/blocks at the end of this century and that europe can be one but it 's separate nations are simply to small and vulnerable . 
  the age of nation states is drawing to a close and if we move now before it 's too late we 'll have a say on our own future , staying locked in an unsustainable go-it-alone mentality is losing everything because you defended everything . 
  their ( in my eyes ) extremely opinionated style of writing . 
  anything european is * by definition * bound to end in abject failure , anything culturally contrary to the anglo-saxon ideal is * by definition * strange or at least slightly iffy and any view on economics that is n't their own brand of particularly libertarian/liberal is * by definition * flawed . 
  i see the economist as an extreme example of the anglo-saxon corporate culture of `` the quantification of all things human '' which in my eyes is poorly applicable to such inherently irrational creatures as human beings . 
  now i 'm no socialist at all but i think they take it way past its optimum . 
  all that being said , i could deal with their and my views occasionally diverging if it were n't for the the air of casual arrogance that suffuses all of their articles . 
  there is a glib smugness about the economist that just annoys the hell out of me . 
  so a less annoying version of the economist ? 
  i might read their work then !, 
  hardly surprising is it ? 
  these are the people who do nothing but regulate everything * ad nauseam * running into a purposefully built wall against excessive regulation . 
  somehow though , the world is still turning , the light still on and the cucumbers still fairly straight . 
  it used to be the case that no or little overlapping regulations existed in the eu and there was much demand for new eu level regulation in order to even out the single market . 
  that period is probably over now , there will always be regulations to streamline but not the glut that existed before . 
  that makes this a good moment to start to slow down the stream of proposed regulations and introduce an element of competition so that only those new proposals that actually have merit will be put forward . 
  tldr : growing pain , they 'll get used to it . 
  this is good for the eu in the long run . 
  2 % quarterly is about 7,5 % annually . 
  that 's fucking huge .
