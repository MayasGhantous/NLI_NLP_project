  as if it 's invalid to try and save our economies so that we have jobs , education , healthcare and defense . 
  it 's not like the drowning africans are n't in the news here . 
  good god !, 
  that 's terrifying !, 
   do n't enter a monetary union with a country like greece . 
  finally something we can all agree upon . 
  toe, 
  a tiny country like the netherlands does n't make policy on that level in the eu though , we only get to choose a side . 
  admittedly we chose it wholeheartedly but to say we 're * as uncompromising * is n't true . 
  as for debt repayment it is but the austerity policies are being criticized here too . 
  not because we do n't believe in austerity but rather because the measures taken seem to be counterproductive . 
   debt relief . 
  is n't happening already because there is no confidence that greece wo n't immediately get back into debt . 
  corruption and poor competitivity do n't exist only because of the debt . 
   reform the euro so that it contains automatic fiscal transfers . 
  plenty of money has flowed into greece in the past and it seems it did little to help the situation . 
  the answer to greece 's problems needs to be found in greece and not simply in more northern taxpayer money going to swiss bank accounts . 
   use the money from the transfers to reform the countries that are lagging behind in the areas that are most critical to make them less reliant on transfers in the future ( ** education ** , ** basic needs welfare ** , improving democratic institutions , ** industry development ** ) why , on god 's green earth , would we need to pay for your education , welfare and industrial development ? 
  ever ? 
  the eu is not a communist plan economy . 
  education and welfare are local issues for local policymakers and industrial development is done by * industry * using their own money . 
  make it sensible for foreign companies to come to greece and set up shop and they will come . 
  all this `` gib monnie ples '' crap needs to end . 
  i do n't get why this is a bad thing . 
  what kind of union would this be if membership were mandatory ? 
  countries realizing they might leave the eurozone might be just the incentive germany needs to stop bullying the poorer parts of the eurozone and just what the poorer parts need to stop acting like there are no consequences to poor policy . 
  ( although that last thing seems to apply mostly to greece which would make the argument a bit crap ... ) anyhow , meh . 
  let them leave if the euro is so bad for them , i 'd love to go on vacation with a cheap drachme . 
  the sooner the better . 
  greece has shown little sign of improvement or even much understanding of their own situation . 
  either we print the money and accept that we have a rotten limb keeping the body sick or we enter a new era in which nations know that presence in the eurozone ( or even the eu ) is not a guarantee . 
  this constant battle against better judgement that is this greek fiasco needs to end . 
  one way , or another . 
  loathe as a i to admit to anything that might support a russian opinion it does strike me that the ukrainian government is pretty awful . 
  the yanukovic ( sp ? ), 
  people who are being murdered , the shelling of cities in the east and the complete idiots ( * including * neonazis ) who fight for ukraine in the east all really do n't make it easier to support ukraine right now . 
  this sort of thing makes my blood boil . 
  sometimes i wonder if incidents like these do n't warrant us quietly sending advanced weapons etc. 
  to ukraine just make sure they kill every last russian when the come again . 
  it would n't necessarily help but it sure would feel nice . 
  in the sense that any proposal that would be nice for the `` dutch '' you guys would go out of your way to complain about it . 
  even if it made no difference to your lives . 
  i just do n't have any confidence that belgian attitudes on politics would suddenly change . 
  i would choose germany , the belgians are too frustrated about everything to ever get politics working . 
  also i think germans are generally prettier and nicer . 
  and she 's right . 
  greece might be our junky cousin but it 's still family and family 's family for as far as i 'm concerned . 
   varoufakis is the man . 
  he has correctly identified the true disease , that eu is not federalized enough . 
  countries like greece are argument no . 
  uno against federalization though . 
  you can rattle off all the usual arguments in favor of european federalization but once the other side mentions greece the whole thing goes out the window . 
  - edit - i honestly do n't understand the downvotes . 
  this * literally * is how discussions about federalization go here . 
   which obviously is not something that is greece 's fault . 
  and thus we can conclude greece 's problems are really not its own fault !, 
  / s i have yet to hear a greek say `` we fucked up '' . 
  why is that ? 
  why always externalize ? 
  why does every discussion have to revolve around greece ? 
   someone might get an impression from your post that it happened because lithuania is small - no , it happened because they played it smart . 
  it was not meant that way . 
  not really but without the prussian flanking manoeuvre the casualties would have been substantially worse . 
  if anything french tactics were simply unsound here , attacking with a smaller force against an enemy on higher ground is pretty bad as it is but to go at it with essentially ones entire forces is setting up for disaster . 
  as the prussians neatly drove home . 
  it 's nice to see a small european nation adopt the euro and through sound fiscal policy put it to good use . 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  everybody happy right ? 
  american 's do n't need to pay for the base and the local economy gets a boost while the entire country gets safer . 
  sounds like a win/win/win . 
  i agree with this guy . 
  i also really do n't see the problem with superficial acceptance . 
  the effect is the same . 
  as if it 's only good enough if people emphatically agree with everyone they encounter in the street . 
  just treat people the way you want them to treat you and stop fussing over things that do n't affect you . 
  when a title is a question the answer is typically * no * . 
  why is it that in france people seem to go on strike every other day ? 
  ca n't you people just sit down like adults and have a discussion once in a while ? 
  somehow that quote always kind of pisses me off ... 
  also i really do n't think this needs to be so expensive . 
  it does ... 
  yes we need plastics and chemicals and we can make them using ...  ** all we need is the carbon atoms and the energy to stick them together ** , the and are ask around us by virtue of us callously burning oil for over a century and the energy is plentiful when we harvest sunlight . 
  in other words , we do need plastics and chemicals and we can make those either by harvesting a finite polluting resource or by harvesting a renewable resource , namely , the carbon dioxide we already put in the air and sunlight . 
  i made the case for the latter . 
  no i 'm not `` one of those environmentalists '' , i just happen to think this short term crap is nothing but postponement of necessary reforms in our energy markets . 
  to say that we 're going to use this oil one way or another need not be true , not at all actually . 
  to make policy on it is nothing other than short term gain with a significant long term cost . 
  especially is moving to renewable energy is a long term process it 's important that we start today , pushing things down the road is not the way to go here . 
  as a chemist i think we should be putting much more effort into carbon capture from the air . 
  if we go back to our industrial carbon dioxide concentrations we can harvest about 50 grams of pure carbon from every cubic meter of air * right now * . 
  on other words , it 's there for the taking and could be a great way of storing solar energy . 
  it could also be used to produce plastics . 
  all we need is the sounds and the energy to stick them together , the and are ask around us by virtue of us callously burning oil for over a century and the energy is plentiful when we harvest sunlight . 
  we really , really need to start putting them together . 
  which is absolutely idiotic . 
  every atom of carbon that stays deep underground is better than one that goes into our atmosphere . 
  we should be ridding ourselves of our dependence on fossil fuels for our energy supply not give up on green energy when the dirty stiff gets cheap again . 
  we 're setting up for disaster right now , in the long run by changing our climate and in the short run by polluting the air we breathe and by giving warlords with oil like putin and the saudi 's a voice they do n't deserve . 
  and its patently nonsensical .
