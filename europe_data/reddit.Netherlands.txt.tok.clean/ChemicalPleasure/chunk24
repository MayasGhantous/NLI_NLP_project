  yes , because it would n't be the disaster you think it would be . 
  and frankly , if the cultures of eastern europe are so easily overwhelmed that a few tens of thousands or even a few hundred thousand syrians might overwhelm them it really would n't be a disaster to lose such weak cultures from the eu . 
  we pretty much do , why else do we go with the americans to any war ( however illegitimate ) ? 
  0.3 % of gni . 
  suck on that uk , we pay more than you do ( per capita ) . 
  considering the money that flows to eastern europe you would think they would be a little more helpful with the refugee crisis . 
  i guess it 's more fun to take than it is to give . 
   that 's such a nonsensical arguments . 
  the netherlands does not give two shits about what happens at the romanian border . 
  it would also be * our border * then you ****** . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's always about corruption . 
  we 've had gypsies in front of our supermarkets for a while , i kind of figured romania was in schengen already . 
  are you telling me it will get worse ? 
  except of course that transport over sea is dirt cheap compared to road or rail . 
  the dutch one is a ridiculous choice . 
  here 's some more representative stuff i found . 
  searching for `` dorpsgezicht '' in google i discovered a site called `` dutchtowns.com '' , how convenient is that ? 
  http://dutchtowns.com/fotos%20dagtrip/maasland/maasland%20dorpsgezicht.jpg https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/dorpsgezicht_schalkwijk..jpg http://dutchtowns.com/fotos%20dagtrip/maarssen/maarssen%20vecht.jpg http://dutchtowns.com/fotos%20dagtrip/geervliet/geervliet%20straatje.jpg that should cover it . 
  french economics : `` it 's not the markets , stupid '' . 
  * ma'am this is starbucks ... * pimpled teenager behind the counter . 
  that would be `` the english approach to being dutch '' . 
  we do it quite differently . 
  i voted `` against '' as well . 
  not because `` it 's not good for ukraine '' or whatever but because it 's not good for us . 
  the `` trade '' portion of the agreement is meaningless because the economy of ukraine is meaningless so that 's a poor reason to associate ourselves with ukraine , especially to the aggravation of our economic future with russia , a much more substantial economy . 
  then there 's `` fighting corruption '' , a part i just do n't believe in . 
  the eu is going to fight corruption in ukraine ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  we ca n't even fight it successfully in greece , italy or bulgaria , all countries that are * in * the eu . 
  then how in gods name are we going to make a dent in ukraine ?!, 
  nonsense . 
  and top it all off we 're going to associate ourselves not just economically but militarily ?!, 
  seriously ?!, 
  ukraine is fucking * at war * , who the hell enters into a military agreement with a country that 's at war ?!, 
  all this for a corrupt , bankrupt `` ally '' at the russian border , whoopee . 
  i do n't even mean this as an insult but i hate hate people like you . 
  such arrogance !, 
  they represent 1.8 % of the population of the eu . 
  i 'd love to see what the rest of the people 's of the eu would have to say about a treaty that includes military cooperation with a country that is at war . 
  as long as you do what germany wants , that seems to be what this union is about lately . 
  well , as it turns out it was n't such a great option was it ? 
  i think a lot of the people who were too arrogant/lazy / `` tactical '' to vote hopefully learned from their mistake . 
  nonsense , people that do n't vote have no voice . 
  all we need to know is that 64 % of dutch people are against the association agreement with ukraine . 
  if you wanted that number to look differently you should have voted in favor . 
  do n't be such a sore loser . 
  corrupt oligarch that proves us right says what ? 
  he 's spanish , no-one in europe cares what the spanish say anyway . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kinda, 
  crude but really this probably sums up  80 % of the `` tegen '' - voters . 
  you guys seem like great people but i 'm not looking to end up in a war zone when i go on holiday . 
  no idea , you tell me . 
  [ one of the posters ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/archives/images/klarelijnkartoengroot.jpg ) i saw today paints a pretty clear picture of the referendum . 
   voted ` ja ' this morning , that makes your vote invalid , the options were `` voor '' or `` tegen '' . 
  jesus this again ? 
  we seem to have gone from once a year to once a month . 
  georgia might be the prettiest country i 'm thrilled not to live in . 
  who cares ? 
  like * anyone * thought putin and his buddies was n't doing this . 
  `` elections '' . 
  both really , i 'm against the association treaty and against the way the eu blithely engages in geopolitics without a proper supporting democracy . 
  well ... banking reforms might be a bit easier to push through once the uk is out . 
  this is like releasing three pigs in a school labeled `` 1 '' , `` 2 '' and `` 4 '' . 
   kremlin puppets jan roos , thierry baudet and bart nijman . 
  right , so anyone not in favor of the association agreement is a `` kremlin puppet '' ... what an incredibly conceited way to view those you disagree with . 
  you do n't have to praise christianity to call culturally ingrained altruism a remnant of our christian past . 
  i 'm seeing that 's what ft believes . 
  according to the british newspaper `` financial times '' . 
  i am . 
  it is now because the uk joined the eu . 
  if that had never fastened things would have been very different . 
  that 's because britons never understood the value of the eu . 
  to you it 's a distant battleground , to us it 's home . 
  expelling the imams already happens , eradicating saudi influence is nearly impossible , changing the faith from within is not something any secular government in the western world should even want to do and boosting surveillance has never proved to make us safer . 
  frankly we already have as good as no privacy left . 
  we should n't post these things , now we 're doing the work of the terrorists for them . 
  you 're wrong . 
  short chain polysacharides are an unavoidable impurity in hfcs . 
  they serve as signal molecules in the human body to signal hunger and make you eat more . 
  ergo , hfcs * is * worse than regular sugar . 
  i do n't believe you . 
  source ? 
  why not just drop a few tens of billions into fusion power ? 
  at least that way we finally get a good way to generate massive amounts of energy without too much radioactive waste . 
  irregardless is a beautiful new word !, 
  might as well just shut up in that case . 
  `` he had to go to the hospital '' , `` which one ? 
  '' , '' * the * hospital '' . 
  in this case way more than the required number signed . 
  once the signatures are there the referendum will be there too . 
  what happens with the outcome of the referendum is less obvious as it not binding . 
  in practice however , to ignore the result would be political suicide for the ruling parties , many people are * still * peeved about the way the eu constitution was weaseled in through the backdoor after we voted no on that . 
  300.000 people need to sign a petition asking for the referendum . 
  i believe ~ 500k actually signed . 
  on a total pop . 
  of 17m . 
   voting no helps putin ( responsible for the death of 193 dutch civilians ) , it hurts the ukrainian people and damages the eu 's reputation and reduces its influence . 
  the russians shot down the plane but i think the people who decided to let an airliner fly there are almost as culpable as the russians were . 
  also to accept a nation like ukraine into the eu ( at whatever rate ) just to spite the russians makes no sense .
