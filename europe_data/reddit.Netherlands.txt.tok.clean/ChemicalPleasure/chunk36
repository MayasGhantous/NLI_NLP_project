  in my opinion a lot is being done to benefit the greeks that is not being acknowledged which is what i 'm speaking against . 
  greece already got debt relief . 
  much of their sovereign debt was replaced by long-term low-interest debt which will cost less than their own value to repay . 
  that 's basically a financial transfer , something many in northern europe were ( and are ) completely against . 
  another thing the north was against its qe , that 's also happening right now . 
  i 'd say greece and the other financially inept nations of southern europe are getting plenty . 
  tackling issues like corruption and poor fiscal policy should be the way forward , not raging at countries that have their stuff sorted out . 
  it does , because it covers up belarus . 
  says the brit ... 
  i hear it all the time . 
  i guess it 's a rather regional one . 
  does n't also mean gps can now be blocked without interfering with galileo service ? 
  for my sense of balance , did the croats and bosnians do horrible things on a similar scale or were the serbs really as awful as they usually seem to be ? 
  if he gets convicted will he still be allowed to migrate to the usa to spend retirement in a `` right-wing think tank '' ? 
  otherwise would israel accept him ? 
  does either country accept convicted felons as immigrants ? 
  * the * hague . 
  the place is called `` the hague '' !, 
  the article states $ 200m per three years . 
  that 's ~ 67m/y . 
  that 's absolutely peanuts on a population of half a billion people . 
  look at the murderous horde ready to invade europe !, 
  he 's the protest vote is n't he ? 
   the greeks had slavery , i 'm not sure they are a great authority is n't how discussions work or logic works either . 
  anatolia is not europe , it 's been asia since roman times . 
  yes , you are . 
  i 've never seen those things happening either in rotterdam , leiden , utrecht or maastricht . 
  the accession treaty was voted down . 
  i 'm pretty sure trade was a part of that . 
  voting against things and being ignored makes you uninterested at some point . 
  as i said , my own personal experience with break ins , thefts , death threats and the dutch police 's responses to each of those suggest the exact opposite . 
  i honestly think the low dutch crimerate has very little to do with the dutch police . 
  considering that every break in me or any of my friends have been a victim of was plainly ignored by the police i have very low expectations of them . 
  not to mention their terrible track record for actually solving crimes that are reported to them . 
  as far as i can tell our police only really get enthusiastic about handing out traffic tickets . 
  the only reason we 're so low is because our police is useless . 
  as long as they work what do you care ? 
  wait what ? 
  why ? 
  is he so wrong ? 
  every time a politician says anything nowadays the press looks for a minor detail to spin into a controversy . 
  i anything politicians should do this more often . 
  having just spent a week in this region of germany i honestly ca n't think of a video that 's more `` german '' than this one . 
  right down to the * slightly * akward dancing or the chubby chick smoking . 
  to describe people like you maybe . 
  yuck ... like actual dutch but soulless and weak ... 
  i never said this tragedy is the fault of the usa , that 's just what you choose to read in my words . 
  what i said is that a particularly cynical fuck-the-poor mindset was once exported to the usa from england and then back again during the reagan/thatcher years . 
  how does that make the current tragedy the fault of the usa ? 
  i clearly suggested it 's the uk 's government that 's at fault based on a mindset that is victorian in origin . 
  too much of the victorian mindset spilled over into the usa and then back into the uk during the reagan/thatcher era . 
  they already had , these are commitments previously entered into . 
  why would anyone make deals with a country that does n't honour its word ? 
  there is such a thing as `` security in obscurity '' . 
  if * everything * is encrypted you 'll spend a lifetime just finding whatever your trying to `` backdoor '' your way into . 
  it 's money greek governments have already spent . 
  if greeks want their country to be taken seriously they 'll have to repay at least what 's left of their debts now . 
  aside from that , if the greek economy grows the percentage of state revenues going to repayment will go down . 
  really now ? 
  such cartoon villains are n't they ? 
  many in `` the 48 % '' were n't big on the eu either , just the economic benefits . 
  after visiting england a few months ago i 've stopped feeling sorry for `` the 48 % '' . 
  considering theresa may 's rhetoric the echr might well be what stands between you having a right to privacy and a protection against unfair trial and you not having those things . 
  to criticize a plot device in order to ignore the plot is not in your best interest . 
  dictatorships generally do n't happen suddenly . 
  i 'm always surprised at how technologically `` backward '' a country like germany is . 
  for instance , you still ca n't pay with a credit/debit card in many places while here in the netherlands we can even pay by tapping our debit card on a reader on flea markets nowadays . 
  i have n't had cash in my wallet for months !, 
  not just a lobby , also the fact that spy equipment is best made in-house . 
  considering the way referenda about eu business are usually ignored here in the netherlands they 'll probably get in just fine . 
  which they 'll pay for once they get rich ? 
  like another greece ? 
  yeah right . 
  you can walk through it on [ google maps !, 
  ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.0803558,4.313947,3a,75y,332.08h,70.05t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjwphx1yxtxznyms6xgwqxa!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  exactly , compared to the germans the french have n't made much of a mark on the eu in recent years which is largely due to fran\u00e7ois hollande who combined a campaign based on not being sarkozy with what appears to be a complete lack of vision . 
  the ** relative ** invisibility of france that resulted is why the `` germany leads the eu '' shtick resonates with so many people . 
  if he 's pissing off all the old guys who let france sink into relative obscurity over the recent years he might be on the right path . 
  you 're wrong . 
  look at the words under the bar . 
  then do n't watch it you sour old man . 
  edit : mulatto ? 
  seriously ? 
  what year is this ? 
   germany will be an islamic state in future , i should have stopped reading sooner ... 
   `` remaining in the eu means that we must accept ** millions ** of refugees '' - probably 90 % of remain voters would say false even though it 's true . 
  ** [ citation needed ] . 
  1672 , never forget !, 
  i once heard an educated estimate that as many as 20 % of all people are really fundamentally intellectually incapable of grasping modern society . 
  i 'll bet you almost all of the `` 14 % '' fall in this category . 
  it 's a problem you ca n't really solve . 
   sambal in particular is a standard addition to a d\u00f6ner sandwich or roll . 
  i literally just told you ... we do n't really eat kebab , we eat d\u00f6ner . 
  on [ rolls ] ( http://angelascatering.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/broodje-doner.png ) and in rolled-up [ `` pizza 's '' ] ( http://dijkhuisandijk.nl/uploads/product/turkse-pizza-doner-kip-3.png ) . 
  we top the meat in either with garlic sauce and sambal . 
  which was our colony which is why we use a lot of their foods and condiments . 
  sambal in particular is a standard addition to a d\u00f6ner sandwich or roll . 
  this culinary tradition is so popular it spread way beyond the netherlands and is also seen in germany , belgium and even turkey . 
  well clearly . 
  they have links to le pen .
