  the english seem to take to american hegemony quite nicely . 
  `` you did n't vote right , try again '' . 
  am i the only one who thinks this flies directly in the face of actual democracy ? 
   like the british in the napoleonic wars , the americans would not fully commit to the fight until the europeans had first bled the soviets dry . 
  from de gaulle 's point of view , this is what the americans had done in world war i and again in world war ii , invading france in mid-1944 to finish off nazi germany . 
  excuse me ? 
  europe did little to `` bleed the germans dry '' , that was the russians . 
  the statement is otherwise perfectly valid of course . 
  ( side note : to those that argue in favor of american domination as opposed to russian domination , * it 's still domination * ) . 
  in the mathematical world of greek statistics there could still be a significant greek contribution . 
  no i mean the current trend in the usa of dwindling civil liberty in the face of a new `` class of nobility '' might well result in a relegation of democracy in favor of actual monarchy/oligarchy . 
  by `` relegation of democracy '' i do n't necessarily mean to imply a king in a royal palace but rather the steady continuation of the present erosion of democracy ( the way companies buy favors from presidential candidates ; rod blagojevich ' corruption ; jeb bush corrupting the vote in favor of his brother ; acta etc. 
  etc. ) . 
  already many americans agree with statements like `` a college education if not an investment '' and `` a billionaire will never be convicted '' ... 
  north of africa , west of asia and east of the first kingdom of north america , 
   seriously i hope that after this whole crisis we ** go back ** to being normal civilized people and doing things with the whole eu involved . 
  you ca n't go back to something that never existed . 
  and apparently not enough common sense either ... 
  yes ... let 's hope so ... 
  are we * still * talking about this ? 
  * slow golf clap * yea the netherlands . 
  a tie between alcohol and caffeine . 
  it does actually lure in quite a few tourists and i think i 'd rather see those tourists than french and german ents . 
  i doubt he 'll ever be in a governing position again , he 's alienated everyone who was even willing to rule with him in the first place and the rest of the parties resented him even before that . 
  the reason dutch law is still strict on the growing of weed is apparently that the eu ( rather : the french ) do n't want the liberal policy to go any further . 
  i do n't know if that is actually true , few discussions on this topic are waged using actual unadulterated facts . 
  more importantly i really do n't care about weed or the childish scene connected to it and to be honest i could do without the german , french and american potheads who come to the netherlands for it . 
  if it 's any consolation to you this policy will probably be reversed after the next elections . 
  i 'm not entirely sure ... 
  i have the feeling that a lot of french only voted/will vote for hollande because he 's * not sarkozy * . 
  from what i 've heard of his political views and plans he 's nothing to get excited about , he sounds like the `` let 's borrow our way out of debt '' - kind of guy and i think we need less of those not more . 
  stay out of our politics germans !, 
  i could not agree more . 
  politically this really is the finest hour of dutch politics , reason and compromise triumphed over facile , infantile populism . 
  especially compared to the childish level of public discourse seen in some south-european nations this makes me proud to be dutch . 
  so calling populism `` populism '' is populism now ?!, 
  i heartily disagree . 
  no , we do n't . 
  maybe you should go back to jacking off . 
  very unlikely , they do n't really fit a niche in the dutch political spectrum and i think people are getting sick of novelty and unknown new little parties doing `` crazy things '' . 
  the liberals ( vvd , though not all that liberal lately , merely conservative ) would * never * form a government with the socialists . 
  even if they did it would last for about an hour before everyone laughs , shrugs and just walks out . 
  we 'll probably see labour grow a fair bit in the months to come , it 's not entirely unlikely that we 'll finally get another purple government . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  how is the situation in any way comparable ? 
  if anyone will suffer it would be the dutch ( as they are now ) , we would have to pay a ton of money to get belgium up to spec ( the roads alone would take a fortune to fix ) . 
  wallonia would cost all the dutch money rather than just the flemish portion as it is now . 
  ideally wallonia would join france and flanders would join the netherlands , one language for one people . 
  if that 's the price i pay it gladly . 
  [ and of course the best one yet  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzrw9nivuum&amp;ob=av2e ) and a [ personal favorite ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykt01h-fl2i ) from a few years ago , 
  1:09 made me laugh hysterically xd, 
  i 'm dutch and to me as a non-danish-speaking person it actually sounds quite ok . 
  it sounds upbeat , i like that . 
  ever been to amsterdam ? 
  do n't bring the mrs. , 
  here 's to another hundred then . 
  just a jibe or an actual choice , care to motivate ? 
  why must the eu keep on expanding the way it does now ?!, 
  much rather i would get to choose for 5 countries to leave the eu . 
  all this bs about communism and fascism in greek political debate spills out into the public domain by actions like this . 
  the fact that people consider this kind of action sensible or useful fits neatly with people firebombing police in the streets and walking around waving communist flags 23 years after the fall of the ussr . 
  to be honest it does n't really change the ideas i had about the childish level of greek political debate . 
  i once spoke to a woman on the train for half an hour who insisted she was canadian and had lived there all her life . 
  her english sounded nothing like canadian english and somewhere in the conversation she stated her father was a republican . 
  i also know that a lot of american students who come for summer internships sow canadian flags to their backpacks , 
  european money no doubt ? ... 
  this is starting to feel like a test ...  how can you characterize the un 's involvement in korea as the us expanding and consolidating its influence when it was the communists that invaded the south and it was the communists that occupied eastern europe ? 
  the communists invaded the south that was * de facto * already `` occupied '' by americans forces after the ussr and the usa divided korea in half after the japanese surrendered . 
  the situation was at an impasse that was deliberately kept unstable in hopes for a chance to unify korea under a single ( capitalist ! ), 
  banner . 
  when the north attacked the usa seized the opportunity and retaliated in force . 
  a plan that was successful until the chinese joined in and drove them back over the 38th parallel and the current stalemate was instated . 
  the communists only occupied eastern europe in the same sense that the americans occupied western europe . 
  do n't forget that anti-communist propaganda in the west was equaled word-for-word in the east . 
   what supporting evidence do you have for the statement the us forces others to join in on their wars ? 
  when did this happen ? 
  remember the irak-war ? 
  how the french refused ? 
  americans still speak of the french as though they are cowards , despite the fact that the french have both fought and won more wars than the usa , go figure !, 
  we 've already touched upon the threat to withhold marshal aid if countries refused to join in the korean war . 
   how can you balance the statement eu had little interest in korea when france fought a war in se asia and the uk as well as the dutch still had holdings that they were willing to defend with force ? 
  would this not equate interests ? 
  if they were not interested , why did nations like turkey and greece commit troops if not concerned about the spread of communism ? 
  us force compelled them ? 
  south-east asia is a long way from korea ... 
  the fact that indochina was once a french colony has no connection whatsoever to korea . 
  the uk and nl had colonies and holdings in indonesia , birma ( then ceylon ) and india , again none of these are even * near * korea , to suggest a link merely based on the geographical fact that all these countries are in asia is ridiculous . 
  turkey and greece were compelled most likely by the inane argument that we hear repeated endlessly nowadays in afghanistan . 
  if all nato members are sending forces the exceptions will be frowned upon , in international relations that can be cause to deny a country a seat in the g-20 , such threats hold a considerable amount of influence . 
  so to answer your last question , yes . 
   what are the parallels btwn the korean war and dutch indonesia ? 
  the imposition of political views out of economical interest . 
  i have read up on the korean war . 
  the korean war is ( arguably ) the first exponent of the domino theory , an ** american ** theory aimed at the consolidation and expansion of ** american ** influence in the world . 
  the interests of european countries in post-war korea were tiny and in no way explained our military intervention in their affairs . 
  only american interests were served by the the korean war . 
  the american threat to withhold marshall aid in the effort to halt the dutch policing actions in indonesia are unrelated in that sense and much more justifiable . 
  especially in light of the - then recent - experiences with nazism/fascism the dutch military bid to recolonize indonesia was disgusting . 
  the korean situation on the other hand revolves around the efforts by kim il-sung ( granddaddy of the current `` monarch '' of korea ) to unify korea under communist rule , not colonization but simply the reconstruction of a state in a different image than pleased the americans so arguably the americans did in korea exactly what they kept the dutch from doing in indonesia . 
  as a chemist i can safely say that i know very few chemists who are not deeply skeptical of the hydrogen economy .
