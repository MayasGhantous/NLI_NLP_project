  they should not feel angry but ashamed in my opinion . 
  and do n't give me that bs argument that most greeks work hard blah blah blah and that it 's only a small political elite screwing everybody over because that 's just not true . 
  how many greek houses have rebar sticking from their top-floor to avoid paying tax ? 
  how many doctors and lawyers said they earned lessthan $ 9000 last year ? 
  how many public officals are there in greece ? 
  tax evasion is a lifestyle for the greeks and it 's high time they got their shit together , it 's been long enough !, 
  again , `` oh piss off '' . 
  oh piss off . 
   exchange germans with european commissioner , does it sound any better ? 
  good , because thats how it would work . 
  yeah right , it was a german idea through and through . 
  also i respectfully disagree with you on the approving/disapproving with greek budget decisions ; not providing actual legislation but only providing the entirely non-democratic yea-or-nae for any legislation is that \u00eds passed is insulting , whether you like it or not the greeks are perfectly within their rights to continually elect inept politicians , that 's democracy for you . 
  also a little paranoia when germans start waving flags seems perfectly justifiable to me ( and i 'm not just talking about 1939-1945 , they also beat us at football in 1978 ) . 
  i 'd like to agree but i do n't . 
  it may appear to make sense that the german chancellor would not be enthusiastic about having to work with a socialist in times of necessary austerity ( at least from a german point of view ) but she knows as well as hollande and sarkozy do that it really wo n't make that much of a difference because french politicians are generally elected when they are closest to the political middle . 
  in the end the electoral result will not cause foreign policy to change too much whoever is elected . 
  it makes more sense that since merkel and sarkozy seem to share their love for imperial-style rule she would hate to lose an ally in favour of a more democratically inclined politician . 
  the more important factor here is the fact that merkel has shown on multiple occasions now that she does not care much for the sovereignty of other european nations . 
  the declaration that `` if greece wo n't take care of business the germans will '' ( i paraphrase of course ) is insulting and freakish , in other settings people would have threatened war for such suggestions !, 
  remember the way the greek and italian governments changed ? 
  these too were strongly influenced by german political interests . 
  to now get herself involved in the electoral business of yet another european nation is beginning to reek of an ( all too german ) sense of superiority over other europeans . 
  i do n't want to godwin this discussion but , to me at least , it seems like that 's what merkel is inadvertently doing herself . 
  after the bizarre suggestion to take over the greek financial sovereignty this is just another sign of the recently rediscovered german sense of superiority . 
  it would be good if the little chancelor got a hold of herself . 
  i think he speaks of the right to bear arms ; freedom of speech and habeas corpus to name but a few . 
  every time an issue comes up the supreme court is eventually forced to make a ruling which slowly but surely delineates the constitution , whether or not this delineation yields the intended outcome ( intended by those who composed the constitution ) is unsure . 
  far better to have a constitution that is set in stone ( or at least as much as possible ) . 
  this !, 
  we need to stop looking across the atlantic for guidance , wwii is a long time ago and the simple politics of the day replaced by a world in turmoil in which european nations should close the ranks and provide not a collection of small ( and thus weak according to `` divide and conquer '' ) feeble nation states . 
  rather form a federal union in which the sovereignty of the member states is protected by the combined military potential of the entire continent . 
  the notion that any european nation needs a military to protect itself from the other european nations should be an inconceivably ridiculous notion thus freeing the way for a shared european military force . 
  of course all this can not be accomplished without proper overarching democratic control !, 
  a bicameral system as proposed by the op with a small number ( ~ 300 ) of directly electable meps from * european parties * . 
  none of this nonsense with parties from all separate countries sending one or two meps , their election is always marred by local bias and local petty strife . 
  if i 'm voting for europe i want european liberals , european conservatives , european socialists , european social democrats , european christian democrats , european greens etc. 
  ideally these would be legally barred from political cooperation across the political strata ( federal , national etc. ), 
  i want to vote for the best european for the job and not be limited by what nitwit had to be `` promoted out of the way '' locally . 
  you wish !, 
  i 'm afraid you might be right but that only makes it worse !, 
  if only lobbying were n't so prevalent in politics we might actually see properly advised politicians !, 
  it worries me enormously sometimes that politicians are apparently this badly informed . 
  typical , there 's no talking to you people ... 
  well ... 
  i 've looked it up and made some comparison with my own country ( the netherlands ) to see how reasonable that statement is and the outcome is that * per capita * the industrial output from the uk actually is n't that fantastic , per person the average dutch citizen produces 1.46 times what the average brit produces . 
  this is not meant as a jibe but rather to indicate that even though the british industrial output is significant in absolute numbers it is not particularly productive when compared to other european nations . 
  a few of the ratios of industrial output * per capita * compared to the uk : * the netherlands 1.46 * germany 1.42 * france 0.98 ( better than the french at least !, 
   ) these examples clearly show that the uk is no longer the industrial power-house it once was which is ( i think ) what profix meant to imply . 
  if you do n't mind my asking ( and this question is not meant to imply judgement of any kind whatsoever !, 
  ) ; do you like living in the uk better than living in the nl ? 
  and if so , what makes the difference for you ? 
  what made you move from nl to the uk ? 
  if this fuken hippie could give a bit more background maybe we could help ... 
  best : ** public transport ** ; a good railway network , buses that go to the middle of nowhere and beyond and good ferry connections . 
  ** healthcare ** ; good hospitals and universal healthcare , even the poorest can go to hospital and get some of the best healthcare in the world . 
  ** working mentality ** , the dutch typically want to stick to the rules and take pride in hard work and honesty ( to the point of rudeness and beyond if required ) . 
  worst : ** feigned tolerance ** , rather than actually tolerating ( or better , accepting ) cultural differences the dutch act butt-hurt pretty much the second someone shows himself to be a little different from what is considered `` normal '' . 
  i think this is the downside of the `` sticking to the rules '' - portion in my * best-of * section . 
  ** a lack of aesthetics ** , many people buy clothes not to look good but simply not to look naked , a bit more flair and style would be nice . 
  again , i think this is part of the `` sticking to the rules '' mentality in which people are careful not to deviate from the norm but overdo it . 
  and finally : ** self-assurance taken to its arrogant extreme ** , the netherlands have gone from the poor backwater of pretty much every large european empire to a small but extremely wealthy and successful trading nation , this has brought a spirit of national ( - ist ? ), 
  self-assurance that is sometimes taken too far into actual condescension towards other nations , a way of thinking that populists can easily exploit ( and do , `` kick those lazy greeks out of the euro '' etc. 
  / r/europe right ? ... 
  i do n't really see the issue here ... airlines make money when they sell tickets to people to fly somewhere , if they do n't sell tickets because they do n't want to for some reason then they ca n't fly there and no profit is made . 
  what choice do they have ? 
  in reality inflation was closer to an average of 3 % which means the total inflation over the last decade comes to ~ 34 % . 
  very few people take into account that their money is now only worth three quarters of what it was worth when the euro was introduced ( besides any effects of incorrect conversion by shopkeepers etc. ), 
  the high inflation rates in spain have a lot to do with the way the spaniards used their money when it flowed freely in the 1990 's . 
  a more austere way of spending would have saved them a lot of trouble . 
  it 's a real shame that the rest of europe has to pay for it . 
  on the other hand , the rest of europe ( the part that 's paying now ) has always reaped much more of the benefits from the common european market so perhaps this * involuntary redistribution of wealth * is not as unfair as it seems . 
  a populist might say that * not working * is the real problem in spain  here in the netherlands we 've seen a small hit in prices but a strong consumer response . 
  for instance a beer used to cost ~ 2,50 guilders ( exchange rate \u01922 ,20371 = $ 1 ) and suddenly cost $ 2,50 so people just stayed at home and got drunk there in stead ( a fact that hotel - and bar owner quickly and falsely attributed to the smoking ban ) . 
  eventually prices in cafe 's lowered ( though still higher than before , a greater increase than inflation can account for ) . 
  the consensus here is that rather than the 2.20371 to 1 conversion rate we should have gotten 2 : 1 , the blame in on the germans who got a great deal at 2dm per euro while our guilder was coupled to the mark , effectively dutch people lost ~ 10 % of their money . 
  on the other hand the price for a beer has n't gone up since years now so slowly but surely things are returning to normal . 
  i think what we 're seeing now is the first evidence of re-equilibration after the markets were perturbed by the introduction of the euro a decade ago . 
  to draw conclusions on the , inevitably tumultuous , first decade of our common currency is akin to declaring a climate-chance after 10 years of data ( unrelated to actual climate change , just for the sake of comparing equally long-term concepts ) . 
  because i say the uk is stuck in the past ? 
  it is . 
  your empire is a thing of the distant past ; your society stratified by such hopelessly obsolete concepts as the working - , middle - and upper-classes ; your economy in the dumps ( industry in the uk is rapidly being overtaken and taken over by foreign companies ) and your government is ` democratically ' elected from a 2 1/2 - party pool of corruption ( expenses-scandal anyone ? ) . 
  when i use hyperbole i did it to gauge the degree to which the redditors from the uk can take a jab ( trolling , yes ) . 
  had i known this place was really just a british circle-jerk i might not have bothered . 
  the fact that you read it as an insult says it all really . 
  ask a german or a frenchman if he thinks it 's as insulting as you think it is . 
  the fact that there seem to be a lot of brits here does not mean you care about the eu . 
  generally you come here to yell derision at the eu and the euro and to shout at the top of your lungs the second someone insults the uk . 
  that much is quite evident from the responses to my trolling . 
  it started out as a big red flag to see if this subreddit is indeed populated by english wankers . 
  turns out the answer is yes . 
  really ? 
  and the english illusions of grandeur are n't ? 
  perhaps it would be best to teach the brits by experience . 
  sever the link between gb and the eu and let them see how well that works out for them . 
  maybe when they see it 's not `` fog over the channel , mainland cut off '' but really `` fog over the channel , gb apparently not missed much ... '' they could finally get over their illusions of the great british empire of the past and join the club . 
  currently the discussion about eu policy and the eurozone revolves mostly around the question of who has what authority . 
  the eu parliament ( ep ) and the european commission ( ec ) want more power to deal with the crisis effectively but the individual nations ( rightfully imho ) are reluctant to concede power to the ec/ep . 
  the ep is a lame duck because it can not write the laws it votes on , this is the sole prerogative of the ec which consists of representatives of all the member states . 
  a single representative for each state in the union . 
  a remnant from a time in which the eu was not a precursor to a federation but simply a transnational institution for the the facilitation of trade and diplomacy .
