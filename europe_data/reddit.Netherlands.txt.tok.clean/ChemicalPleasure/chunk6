  the steamroller approach taken by schulz does n't fit that at all . 
  how depressing that a totalitarian like schultz might get such a position . 
  between him and barosso i do n't think any talent for liberal thought ( or in case of barosso any thought at all really ) is there to be found ... 
  as a liberal democrat , i hope that will not happen . 
  you see this in much of northern europe , historically there were multiple christian parties in all our parliaments ( catholic , protestant and a number of further fringe/subdivision-type christian parties ) . 
  over time religion became less of a factor in northern european parliaments leading to the fusion of the shrinking christian parties . 
  over time the christian aspect has given way to conservatism as a whole with a declining focus on the christian aspect thereof . 
  maybe if greece leaves the euro , or even better if germany would leave the euro . 
  otherwise there is no reason to assume this crisis will get much better for greece in the coming years . 
  so greeks are n't working huh ? 
  assuming turkey is invited to a european party , 
  with what ? 
  this bs again , we get to set our own tax-policies and that 's exactly what we do . 
  there is no morality to this story , just business . 
  just like other nations complaining are only doing it to get a bit of the action . 
  i like how this is quickly turning into a complete embarrassment for the usa , the longer they wait the more impotent they seem and stranger an eventual attack will look . 
  meanwhile assad is n't sitting still so some time soon either the usa will have to attack or it will be too late . 
  i 'm going out for more popcorn . 
  in dutch `` lul '' means dick , so i guess you 're technically correct . 
  all well and good but as a dutch person i 'd love to have a new ( less ridiculous ) anthem . 
  i just made a side note , whether istanbul or tokyo get the olympics is something i could n't care less about . 
  as long as it does n't go to spain , they ca n't afford it right now . 
  `` but the other kids are doing it too ! '', 
  that thing with the armenian genocide is also really bad but not recent , that 's why i chose to mention the journalists . 
  no sudan has oil ... 
   calling turkey `` a huge political mess '' is a bit extreme if you ask me tell that to all the journalists in prisons throughout turkey . 
  japan should have it , let them spend a stupendous amount of money on what is essentially a bauble for nations . 
  people always claim the olympics bring in more money than they cost but i 'm not convinced , it 's not as though there is any way to get honest figures anywhere anyway ... 
  hou do n't seem to grasp the concept of ** private ** debt ... 
  which will never happen , germany might be useful in taking the lead in setting up a sufficiently capable and powerful eu secret service to prevent american espionage . 
  let 's stop complaining and fight back . 
  north or south ? 
  i 'm not so much offended at the fact that the americans are doing everything they can to get ahead as i am offended that the only thing our governments can do is bitch about it . 
  to me it looks like deflection tactics meant to make us ignore that our governments are not sufficiently protecting us . 
  it 's high time we got this eu thing going properly so that we do n't have to take shit from the americans ( if anyone rather they from us ) . 
  i just returned from spain and despite having traveled much of andalusia i ca n't say that i 've seen much of this poverty . 
  i do n't know if perhaps andalusia is a particularly rich part of spain but what i can say for certain is that i 've never seen so many fat children ... 
  belgians ca n`t even solve belgium ` s problems , belgian houses typically look frankenstein switched carreers to be a contractor , if you step down from your ( poorly constructed ) ivory tower you might learn something . 
  you sound like one of the opponents of the industrial revolution . 
  progress sometimes means people will need to move to a different occupation , that ` s just the way it goes . 
  it just vomits class does n't it !, 
  my god ... 
  i always thought the crappy music at the eurovision was meant to be a joke but you guys actually listen to that kind of stuff ? 
  the french use much more cannabis than we do . 
  if you like cannabis you 'd be better off in france . 
  i guess the golden dawn is n't helping greece 's reputation ... 
  i ca n't really think of anything funny about it yet ... 
  it 's just so juvenile ... 
  my image may be skewed by always seeing them in gross places but they do n't look all that clean usually . 
  there 's plenty of profit to be made even if the percentage only goes up by one percent . 
  i wish the eu would subsidize this sort of thing more in stead of subsidizing untenable farming and marinas ... 
  `` they '' ? 
  is greece not eastern europe ? 
  oh so * now * you 're a country are you ? 
  it will be a good day when germany and flanders finally join the netherlands !, 
  my god ... 
  i always kind of thought of bulgaria as a ( pardon me please ) somewhat backward place but this is just shocking ... 
  as a dutch person who is in no way related to the deceased my feelings are dominated by annoyance at the fact that the doctors seem to have made more of an effort for this man than they would have for any other dutch citizen because he was a member of the royal family . 
  i find it shocking that in 2013 a member of the royal family is still valued higher than another person . 
  in rotterdam a lot of them have been closed or converted to other purposes as well ( even mosques i think ) . 
  in maastricht they turned one into a bookstore which is pretty awesome . 
  fascinating , here in the netherlands that 's a sight i 've never seen !, 
  as a dutch person i realize that while this will make my mobile subscription cheaper at the expense of some of the rest of europe . 
  but frankly , yeah !, 
  now the finns are involved too ? 
  how is this not simply a crime ? 
  can i assume the police summoned the shopkeeper to remove the sign and that they fined him ? 
  the answer to the question in the title is * yes * . 
  and the * why * behind it is that for some fucking reason we keep on accepting that by reason of economics fully capable people are not working and producing * anything * but in stead are forced to sit by idly getting older as our elected politicians are failing to resolve the crisis . 
  look at countries like spain and greece , tons of young people who should have jobs are forced to sit still because the money needed to pay them is not there . 
  by now turning on the printing press and jumpstarting things is starting to look like a pretty good option , austerity in times of crisis is folly . 
  so that we could all be poor now ? 
  not this crap again , they represent you because you elect them . 
  this distinction you 're trying to make is fake . 
  to the casual outside observer greek financial policy throughout the 90 's up to 2008 sure presented that image . 
  it 's a large part of why the rest of europe has so little faith in greece right now . 
  can you provide some examples ? 
  was this money meant to end up in the state budget ? 
  ( as this article implies ) iirc the bailout money was only supposed to be a loan to cover the other loans while greece got it 's shit together through privatization of state property and layoffs in the public sector . 
  this money was not a grant to fix all of greece 's problems , i 'm fairly confident that such a thing is not even legal under the maastricht treaty . 
  i 'm from holland ( the southern variety ) and i would love it if the flemish would join us again . 
  we 'd have two stonking great ports , a significantly larger population that is - on average - highly educated , hard working and rich . 
  it just seems so stupid to split our dutch language over two small countries , together we 'd be more influential in europe . 
  this will be an impopular ipionion but to my mind this map shows nicely where the eu should have ended . 
  without so much corruption we would be rich and perfectly comfortable . 
  like now , but with more peace of mind . 
  then fucking do something real about it !, 
  it would really help the eu if we got more tangible short-term benefits from it rather than only articles about corruption and failing crisis management all the time . 
  looks almost arabic . 
  lesson for lagarde : shut the fuck up and stop ruining peoples lives in the eurozone . 
  if anything has become clear it is that christine lagarde is as corrupt as she is inept and that she ( and the imf ) should stop `` informing '' eurozone policy makers , she 's not helping . 
  gas extraction actually . 
  it 's not really a country is it ? 
  i only barely noticed it myself , 
   do n't you have albanians in ** luxembourg ** ? 
  ftfy, 
  you do your name justice . 
  when someone does something right it should be recognized . 
  if i were obama i 'd sit in one of the german police cars just behind all those fancy black cars . 
  i 'd get to practice my german and fool everybody at the same time !,
