   tunisia roughly 6,000 tunisians have left home to join the ranks of isis , the highest per capita rate in the world . 
  cabo verde is great . 
  i have never been there myself , but there 's a large cabo immigrant community in the netherlands . 
  i am acquainted with a couple of cabo-dutch people , and they 're lovely , friendly people . 
  ... i actually cried after losing the 2010 final . 
  i was 14 years old at the time , football was the most important thing in my life back then , and i had hoped we would finally win so , so much . 
  even my parents looked devastated . 
  it 's interesting/funny how such a supposedly `` trivial '' thing like football can emotionally affect me and many others so much . 
  ** per capita **, 
  what did the harassment in liege consist of ? 
   nah , there 's some very cool modern architecture from recent years imo . 
  could you give me some examples ? 
  this seems to be a common theme : the ugly cities that people list in this thread are full of modern architecture : the city was bombed in wwii and was rebuilt , or it is a planned city . 
  either way , it seems like architects and urban planners lost their marbles after , say , the 1950s , and decided to build only ugly buildings . 
  which italian cities have you been to ? 
   i 'd love to see even more diversity in europe damn , this is some hardcore virtue signalling . 
  other pop songs that a considerable amount of dutchmen have probably sung drunkenly at least once : guus meeuwis - het is een nacht ramses shaffy - laat me de kast - in nije dei normaal - oerend hard, 
  i know dutch people are also somewhat guilty of this , but why do so many swedes feel the need to switch to swedish in threads where english is the main language ? 
   the brits always come in drunk groups same thing happens in amsterdam . 
  it 's not bad linguistics . 
  i understand what you 're trying to say . 
  you 're asking which dialect most closely approaches the standardized version of a language . 
  for most languages , that 's going to be the region that the standardized version was based on . 
  the way you phrased it might make a linguist raise an eyebrow , but it 's not necessarily `` bad linguistics '' . 
  i agree with you that the user you replied to is being pedantic , which makes him / r/iamverysmart material . 
  for the netherlands : the catholic south versus the protestant north the highly urbanized megalopolis of the randstad ( which includes amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht , among others ) versus the rest of the country . 
  the frisian speaking part of the country versus the rest of the country . 
  and in an international , language-based context : flemish dutch versus netherlands ' dutch . 
  i am from a town near amsterdam , and i 've never heard someone under the age of 50 use it . 
  i associate ` ga toch heen ' with comics from the 1950s and 1960s , not with modern-day language use . 
  gent is an eastern european city now ? 
  i remember seeing a stereotype map of estonia , in which estonia was divided in three regions : * places where people leave their car unlocked when parked ( the islands ) * places where people leave their car unlocked while driving ( most of the rest of estonia ) * places where people lock their car while driving ( the region in northeastern estonia that you described ) . 
  i 'll see if i can find that map . 
  good god , that is beautiful !, 
  this is a myth . 
  social mobility in the us is worse than in most european countries . 
  you only read about the exceptions . 
  there are lots of self-made millionaires that came from poor backgrounds in germany . 
  eh , ghettoization is a massive problem in the us . 
  take a look at the racial dot map , you 'll see that whole neighborhoods are 99 % white , 99 % black , 99 % hispanic or 99 % asian . 
  the us is not a ` melting pot ' but more like a ` salad bowl ' or ` mosaic ' , with lots of different ingredients or pieces that do n't mix together as much as you 'd like them to . 
  jay-jay okocha : so good they named him twice also , i 'd love a link to the harry potter scam story . 
  true !, 
  i did n't read a lot of smurfs comics , but i loved yakari . 
  i do n't know how i could forget about that one . 
  [ continued ] ** blueberry ** -- gritty comic , also about the american wild west . 
  beautiful art , very serious storywriting , aimed at an older audience . 
  from wikipedia : `` it chronicles the adventures of mike blueberry on his travels through the american old west . 
  blueberry is an atypical western hero ; he is not a wandering lawman who brings evil-doers to justice , nor a handsome cowboy who `` rides into town , saves the ranch , becomes the new sheriff and marries the schoolmarm . '', 
  in any situation , he sees what he thinks needs doing , and he does it . '', 
  most of the comics i just listed are made by french or belgian authors and illustrators . 
  these comics are very popular throughout western and northern europe . 
  donald duck is extremely popular in northern and central europe , as well as italy . 
   italian , spanish  south american languages what the fuck, 
  superhero comics are almost exclusively american . 
  most dutch comic enthuasiasts grew up reading bandes dessinees ( a french word used to refer to franco-belgian comics ) , donald duck comics , and later on graphic novels . 
  the quintessential comics of my youth were : * ** asterix and obelix ** -- french adventure/humor comic about a village of gauls ( the ancient , celtic inhabitants of france ) that resist the occupation of [ gaul ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaul ) by the roman empire . 
  it takes place during the reign of julius caesar , who also features prominently in some stories -- even meeting asterix and obelix , the titular heroes of the comic , on some occassions . 
  the comic is full of historic references and has a very subtle , `` flintstones '' - like vibe in some places : a lot of the jokes in asterix rely on modern anachronisms with an ancient twist . 
  examples of this include a version of the beatles ( but with bards and lyres ) , ox-drawn double-decker buses in londinium ( ancient london ) , parodies of capitalism in the obelix & co. story , helvetians ( ancient swiss ) citizens yelling `` cuckoo '' to remind everyone to turn their hourglasses , an international conference of tribes in geneva , and so on and on . 
  the comic was written by ren\u00e9 goscinny , and drawn by albert uderzo . 
  even though the quality of the later albums slowly deteriorated after the death of goscinny , the series remains one of the most popular -- if not the most popular -- comics in europe . 
  * ** gaston lagaffe ** -- walloon belgian comic that appeared in the franco-belgian comics magazine spirou between 1957 and 1996 . 
  it was originally conceived to fill some empty space in the magazine , but it rapidly became one of the most popular comics in the magazine . 
  the series consists of half-page or page-long gags focusing on the titular hero gaston lagaffe . 
  he works as an office junior at the offices of spirou magazine ( so meta ! ), 
  and is possibly the laziest employee in the world . 
  most of the gags revolve around his attempts to avoid doing office work . 
  this comics is absolutely amazing : lots of nervous characters , bizarre situations , and classic comic tropes . 
  the comic art is defined by an absurd dedication to detail , considering it 's merely a `` simple '' gag comic . 
  * ** les tuniques bleues ** ( literally `` the blue coats '' ) -- walloon belgian comic , called blauwbloezen in dutch . 
  this comic is about the us civil war . 
  the main characters are two northern union cavalrymen : a corporal that constantly tries to avoid battle , and his sergeant . 
  while a lot of the subject matter is [ very serious ] ( http://www.bedetheque.com/media/planches/planches_178.jpg ) and [ historically ] ( https://media.senscritique.com/media/000000040937/source_big/bull_run_les_tuniques_bleues_tome_27.jpg ) [ accurate ] ( http://www.bd-best.com/bgfiles/6131tuni-54-f-01.jpg ) , the comic is drawn in a [ comical style ] ( http://blog.francetvinfo.fr/popup/wp-content/blogs.dir/373/files/2015/07/tuniques-bleues-3-1024x786.jpg ) , and contains a lot of humor . 
  this is one of my personal comics favorites . 
  it 's called bob et bobette in french-speaking parts of europe . 
  this is the defining comic of flanders . 
  the comics are about two tweens , their foster mother , and their friends . 
  together , they embark on bizarre adventures , that take place in every conceivable setting : belgium , foreign countries , the past , the future , outer space , alternate dimensions ... suske and wiske is mostly aimed at kids and tweens , but also has a hardcore adult fanbase for some reason . 
  it was first published in 1945 , and new books continue to be published . 
  while there are some extremely well-written stories , the defining flaw of suske and wiske is that the publishers opt for quantity over quality : as of 2017 , over 360 full-length albums have been published . 
  after the 2000s , this series fell off hard especially , with lots of / r/fellowkids tier stories , and author changes that have caused the series to lack cohesion in style and tone . 
  * ** donald duck ** and all the comics that take place in the so-called `` duckverse '' -- mostly european-made duck comics , usually from italy , denmark , and the netherlands . 
  some us authors like don rosa and barks are also really popular . 
  hundreds of different authors and artists , an extremely fast output , extreme differences in quality , writing , art , themes and story length , all of this makes it very hard to define this comic in a few simple sentences . 
  it 's more a `` brand '' of comics than a series . 
  even though it 's all disney characters , most of the stories are originally published in italian , dutch , danish , german or spanish , and remain untranslated into english . 
  * ** spirou et fantasio ** -- called * robbedoes en kwabbernoot * in dutch , originally franco-belgian . 
  this comic takes place in the same universe as the equally popular gaston lagaffe . 
  ( in fact , gaston lagaffe started out as a spin-off comic from spirou et fantasio ) . 
  spirou is also the mascotte of the eponymous franco-belgian comics magazine . 
  has had multiple authors , but andr\u00e9 franquin developed the strip from single gags and short serials into long adventures with complex plots , and is usually considered as the definitive author of the strip . 
  * ** familie doorzon ** a quintessentially dutch comic . 
  somewhat [ offensive ] ( http://informatiesite.stripaap.nl/images/stories/ouderwetsgoed/201311novemberdoorzon/ouderwets_goed_doorzon_plaatje1.jpg ) comic about the surreal adventures of a dutch suburban middle class family with the surname `` doorzon '' ( literally `` the bigwindows family '' , i 'd loosely translate it to `` the suburbans '' ) . 
  filled to the brim with references to dutch culture , so almost incomprehensible to a non-dutch audience . 
  this series contains a lot of tropes that pushed the limits of mainstream dutch comics . 
  * ** the adventures of tintin ** -- walloon belgian comic drawn by herg\u00e9 ( pen name of georges remi ) . 
  possibly the most important european comic ever made . 
  sold 200 million albums and was translated into 70 languages . 
  nothing tops this , except maaaaybe asterix .
