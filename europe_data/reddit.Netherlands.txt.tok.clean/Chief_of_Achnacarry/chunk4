  the comic is about a young belgian reporter and his best friend captain haddock . 
  together , they embark on very realistic adventures that take place in the mid-20th century . 
  the writing is top-notch , but it has become especially famous for its art , which has been dubbed [ `` ligne claire '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ligne_claire ) ( clear line ) . 
  according to wikipedia : `` it uses clear strong lines all of the same width and no hatching , while contrast is downplayed as well . 
  cast shadows are often illuminate . 
  additionally , the style often features strong colours and a combination of cartoonish characters against a realistic background . '', 
  * ** kiekeboe ** -- belgian comic . 
  very similar to suske and wiske , but it is aimed at a slightly older audience . 
  marcel kiekeboe , the titular hero , is an average joe and an anti-hero . 
  he experiences increasingly implausible adventures , together with his wife and kids . 
  * ** blake and mortimer ** -- the main protagonists of this comic are philip mortimer , a leading british scientist , and his friend captain francis blake of the british secret service agency mi5 . 
  the main antagonist is their sworn enemy , colonel olrik , who has appeared in almost every book . 
  their confrontations take them into the realms of detective investigation and science-fiction , dealing with such themes as time travel , atlantis and espionage . 
  the art style of this comic , although typical of the belgian comics drawings ( called `` clear line '' or `` ligne claire '' ) , is specific in its extensive use of light colors and shots very similar to what can be found in film production . 
  the writing is extremely high quality . 
  one of my favorites . 
  * ** sjors & sjimmie ** -- dutch comic about two boys , one white , one black . 
  started out in 1938 , with the black guy depicted in a really racist , stereotypical manner . 
  it got a rehaul in the 60s , when the original author quit . 
  the racist stereotypes were removed , and the stories took place closer at home and usually in the form of page-long gags or album-long stories - instead of the initial `` paper strips '' that never seemed to end . 
  * ** agent 327 ** -- dutch , whimsical comic about the somewhat incompetent dutch secret service , and their foremost secret agent , agent 327 . 
  he is a cross of a competent bond-like character and an incompetent moron , which makes for some excellent action/comedy crossover fun . 
  dynamic art with influences from herg\u00e9 's `` ligne claire '' , but the caracters have ridiculously cartoony faces and bodies instead of the flat , simple character art of tintin . 
  * ** jan , jans en de kinderen ** -- dutch comic that literally almost every dutch person has read . 
  it 's a slice-of-life bout an average [ dutch middle-class family ] ( http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/jan-jans-en-de-kinderen_6085.jpg ) , it 's a gag comic , with every gag being exactly one page long . 
  it deals with lots of family-oriented themes and is a good example of the dutch ethos of [ `` gezelligheid '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gezelligheid ) . 
  coincidentally , the original author died a few days ago . 
  * ** storm ** ( i am referring to the don lawrence comics , not the american superheroine comics ) -- it 's beautifully drawn/painted sci-fi/fantasy crossover . 
  english/dutch production . 
  not too big of a fan of some of the writing , but it 's worth it for the art alone . 
  * ** lucky luke ** -- belgian comic about the american wild west . 
  full-length stories that rely on humor and elements parodying the western genre . 
  the protagonist is the ` lawful good ' cowboy lucky luke , who often takes on the ` chaotically evil ' dalton bandits .

  then why do you vote for them ? 
  which party is that ? 
  which party did you vote for ? 
  would there be a scenario where you 'd vote for le pen , if she reaches the second round ? 
  and what are your thoughts on macron ? 
  is there any possibility for electoral reform in the uk ? 
  which party did you vote for ? 
  you know , hearing those things changes the situation . 
  good to hear she was fired . 
  i just googled `` swedish minister auschwitz '' , and asa romson popped up . 
  that 's the one right ? 
  i remember her face , is n't she the one who was bawling her eyes out when she had to hold a press conference about rejected asylum seekers or something like that ? 
  you know , it sounds like the press treated her really unfairly . 
  her heart was probably in the good place , she just said two or three slightly clumsy things that have got nothing to do with her capabilities as a minister . 
  of course , i am probably missing out on more serious scandals involving her , so i wo n't judge the situation too quickly . 
  christ dude , knock it off . 
  we do n't care that it is not that serious and intended to make a loved one smile . 
  we are worried that these types of requests are slowly clogging up our subreddits . 
  we 're getting a lot of requests along the lines of `` hey , can you take a picture with a note ' [ name ] 's love is so big it has reached [ place ] '' . 
  it 's getting old really , really fast , and i hope the moderators institute a blanket ban against these spammy requests . 
  you know those love locks on bridges ? 
  mostly american tourists leave those love locks behind on the bridges in my hometown , they clog up the bridge , damage the paint , and it is a serious hassle for the local city government to remove them . 
  these posts remind me of a digital version of those annoying , corny love locks . 
  what was the initial offensive remark about auschwitz ? 
  sometimes we also say ` citroentje twiks ! ', 
  i do n't believe that . 
  literally everyone i know can sing the first part of the wilhelmus ( the part that matters ) . 
  voat is swiss . 
  also , do n't go there , it 's an awful website full of neo-nazis . 
   funny you say that , pvv has thus far always been overestimated in the polls here . 
  that 's not true . 
  the pvv was polling 16-18 seats in the polls in the weeks preceding the 2010 elections , but got 24 seats in the actual elections . 
  the netherlands : ** hilversum ** - the media city . 
  lots of tv and radio broadcasting . 
  most dutch tv and audio studios are situated in this town . 
  from wikipedia : `` the town is often called `` media city '' since it is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the netherlands . 
  radio netherlands , heard worldwide via shortwave radio since the 1920s , is also based here . 
  hilversum is home to an extensive complex of audio and television studios belonging to the national broadcast production company nos ( nederlandse omroep stichting ) , as well as to the studios and offices of all the dutch public broadcasting organisations and many commercial tv production companies . 
  as a result , many old am radio sets in europe had a hilversum dial position marked on their tuning scales ( along with athlone , kalundborg and others ) . 
  the dutch voting in the eurovision song contest usually takes place from hilversum . '', 
  ** the hague ** - the government city . 
  the parliament , most of the ministries , and a whole bunch of other important institutions are located in this city . 
  the city is absolutely bursting at the seams with government agencies , embassies , courts , and a whole ragtag team of ngos and international businesses . 
  ** rotterdam ** - the port of rotterdam is the largest port in europe , and from 1962 to 2004 the largest port in the world . 
  the port itself covers an absolutely massive land area , stretching from the coast to the inland city centre of rotterdam , and beyond . 
  there is nothing like it anywhere else in europe . 
  the economic hinterland is enormous , reaching as far as austria and switzerland . 
  ** delft ** - famous for its technical university . 
  ** eindhoven ** - it and lightbulbs . 
  ** aalsmeer ** - almost everyone in the netherlands is familiar with this town because it is home to the [ aalsmeer flower auction ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/aalsmeer_flower_auction ) , the largest flower auction in the world by far . 
  flowers from all over the world are traded here . 
  from wikipedia : `` the aalsmeer flower auction building is the second-largest building by footprint in the world , covering 518,000 square metres ( 5,580,000 sq ft ; 128 acres ) '' ** hillegom ** - a small town that is the hub of the dutch bollenstreek , which is a region where the majority of tulip bulbs are grown . 
  ** gouda ** - cheese . 
  ** alkmaar ** - well known for its cheese market . 
  a lot of people that do n't live in apeldoorn primarily know this town from the tv advertising slogan `` even apeldoorn bellen '' ( `` got ta call apeldoorn '' ) of the insurance company centraal beheer . 
  they have been broadcasting silly , humorous tv adverts on nationwide tv channels since 1985 , and thus the phrase has become a memetic expression in the netherlands . 
  ** southern limburg ** - used to be known for mining and quarries . 
  those industries died in the mid-20th century though . 
  ** twente ** - used to be home to one of the larger textile industry regions in europe , but this industry has almost died out . 
  nrc handelsblad - smack down in the middle of the dutch political spectrum . 
  secular centrists with an interest in economics form a large share of its readership . 
  trouw - very neutral , high quality reporting , although they have a slight emphasis on religion and theology . 
  christian centrists ( like my mother ) form a large share of its readership . 
   schwangerschaftskonfliktberatung what a beautiful mess of a word . 
   she has already lost in one court , but is backed up financially by american lobbyists if there is one thing that really , really activates my almonds , it 's those fucking american lobby organizations meddling with the political process of european countries . 
  does sweden have laws against foreign lobbying ?
