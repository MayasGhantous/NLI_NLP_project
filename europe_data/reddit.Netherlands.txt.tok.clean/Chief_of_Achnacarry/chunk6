  * virginia : us civil war battle sites . 
  * the carolinas and georgia : it 's all a blur of black people , conservatism , bible belt tropes and stereotypical americanisms to me . 
  * alabama : ... oh boy , where do i start ? 
  the deepest south possible . 
  in the netherlands , alabama is basically shorthand for backwardsness . 
  * mississippi : [ thank god for mississippi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thank_god_for_mississippi ) . 
  * lousiana : good food ( not so dutch ) , high murder rates ( not so dutch ) , floods ( very dutch ) . 
  * florida : the home state of / r/floridaman , this state is full of old people , jews , alligators , shitty prefab architecture , cubans , b-list celebrities , haitians , and tourists . 
  they should rename the florida panhandle to * i ca n't believe it is not alabama * . 
  * west virginia : poor whites in trailers , dying from opoid overdoses . 
  * ohio : prime rust belt territory . 
  gets to pick the president . 
  * michigan : some parts of detroit resemble the bombed-out aftermath of a warzone . 
  the people 's republic of ann arbor would probably vote to become a member of the ussr , if it still existed . 
  flint is an even worse version of detroit . 
  the southwestern part of michigan is full of dutch people . 
  up north , it 's snow mobiling , fourwheeling , trailers and nature , even further north it 's finnish people in the yooper peninsula , and a peculiar island without cars . 
  ( why does this dutch guy know so much about michigan you ask ? 
  well , i 've been all over michigan . 
  it was a really fun state to visit actually , 10/10 would michigan again ) . 
  * indiana : why . 
  * kentucky : it 's a goddamn [ piece of kentucky fried chicken ] ( http://i.imgur.com/php0nhp.png ) !, 
  for the eastern half , see my description of west virginia . 
  * tennessee : country music !, 
  this state is really heartland americana in many , many ways . 
  oh , and because you ai n't a proper us state without a city full of poor , black ghettoes , they decided to include memphis within the borders of tennessee , even though geographically that does not make sense to me at all . 
  ( seriously , why are there so many big us cities right on the borders of states ? ), 
  * illinois : there are two illinoises , really : homicide illinois and corn illinois . 
  like ny state , this state 's politics are absolutely dominated by one city . 
  * wisconsin : i know that milwaukee is supposedly the most racially segregated city in america . 
  other than that , i know relatively little about this state . 
  * minnesota : i have family living here , but weirdly enough i ca n't really think of any stereotypes pertaining to this state right now . 
  * iowa : corn and [ this ] ( http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/citi/images/standard/weblarge/webimg_000347/190741_4104701.jpg ) . 
  * missouri : it really annoys me that kansas city is not in kansas , but in missouri . 
  other than that , i do n't know a lot of stereotypes about this state . 
  * arkansas : bible-thumpers . 
  i always imagine this state is permanently stuck in the 1980s , roughly around the height of the satanic ritual abuse panic . 
  * the dakotas : drunk injuns and lutherans with northern european ancestry . 
  * kansas and nebraska : flat as a board and about as interesting as watching paint dry . 
  these states are so uninteresting that the only tourist attractions are probably things like `` the town with the biggest ball of string in the world '' . 
  * wyoming : unconfirmed reports claim people live here , but i am still full of doubts . 
  * texas : basically the generic us conservative stereotype , but on steroids -- guns , country girls , pickup trucks , and the bible * oklahoma : * great value * version of texas . 
  more injuns . 
  half the state probably claims to be descended from a cherokee princess . 
  * colorado : if reddit were a state ( earthporn , weed and libertarians ) . 
  denver seems like one of the most liveable big cities in the us . 
  * washington and oregon : tree-hugging liberals west of the cascade range , and dry land full of conservatives in the east . 
  portland harbors some of the worst types of hipsters and extreme liberals . 
  supposedly , it always rains in seattle . 
  * utah : mormons * idaho : mormons and potatoes . 
  i heard the northern panhandle is quite beautiful ? 
  * montana : * literally who ? 
  * * arizona : sun belt retirees and navajo indians . 
  ** why is there a city with millions of inhabitants in the middle of the desert , in the scorching heat ? 
  please answer this question , it 's been burning on my mind since forever !, 
  ** * new mexico : false advertising , not part of mexico . 
  * literally who * , until breaking bad was broadcast . 
  a lot of hispanics live here , i think . 
  * california : this state has everything , even though everybody outside california always seems to think the only inhabitants are liberals that are very afraid of gun magazines . 
  there are ultraliberal places , ultraconservative places , and everything inbetween . 
  immense wealth and immense poverty , so many different biomes , and so many different versions of american society here . 
  * alaska : bigger than texas !, 
  the nature and wildlife in this state seems to be incredible , if the photos are to be believed . 
  i wan na hotbox weed here in a log cabin with a couple of lumberjacks . 
  * hawaii : asians , native hawaiians , volcanoes , surfing and tourists . 
   i do n't want to be a dick here but indonesians are from south-east asia . 
  i am very aware of that fact . 
  colonial history is obviously very important in dutch education . 
  i am using `` east asian '' as the modern , socially acceptable shorthand for the now old-fashioned term `` mongoloid race '' used in the ( outdated ) tripartite typological model of race . 
  mostly because that latter name has uncomfortably racist undertones to me . 
  the netherlands has a huge indonesian community of predominantly mixed east asian and dutch ancestry . 
  most of them are descended from the indonesians that associated themselves with the dutch colonial elite . 
  as a result , they are highly educated and -- apart from their physical appearance -- fairly indistinguishable from the native dutch . 
  they form by far the biggest east asian group in my country . 
  we usually call them [ indo 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indo_people ) . 
  the first and second generation of indo 's number about half a million according to official statistics , but the total figure of indo 's is higher according to researchers . 
  estimates vary , but range from 800,000 to 2 million . 
  in my friend group alone , there are several indo 's , including my best friend . 
  the stereotypes pertaining to indo 's are overwhelmingly positive , and jokes about them are relatively good-spirited : - indo grandmothers that cook huge amounts of good food ( [ rijsttafel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rijsttafel ) ) and that want their grandchildren to eat a lot and finish their plate . 
  - references and jokes about rice , peanuts and kroepoek - replacing words with javanese and malaysian slang when speaking dutch ( not common among the younger generations ), 
  i am frisian , and if we 're talking fringe theories pertaining to the origins of an ethnic group , i have got the motherlode for you : the [ oera linda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oera_linda_book ) book , a forgery from the 19th century that is still held in high regard by some neo-nazi groups . 
  it purports to describe ancient european history from 2194 bce to 803 ce , reserving a prominent role for an ancient frisian society that supposedly founded european civilization :  the claim is also made that this frisian civilization possessed an alphabet which was the ancestor of the greek and phoenician alphabets . 
  when the book surfaced in the 1860s , dutch and frisian scholars almost immediately recognized that it was an hoax . 
  however , in the 1930s , some more esoterically minded nazis ( why is it always the goddamn nazis ?? ), 
  took an interest in the book and a `` debate '' regarding its authencity erupted again . 
  one of the main oera linda enthusiasts and defenders of its authenticity was heinrich himmler . 
  when a nazi think tank concluded that it was a falsification , the esoteric nordicist ideologies of himmler and his followers took a huge blow , and the book became a footnote in history again . 
  these days , only the crackiest among crackpots still believe it is genuine . 
  at this point , `` oera linda '' has become a running gag in many frisian families , including mine . 
  basically , if you 're a little * too * proud of your frisian identity , someone will probably quickly respond with something like `` oh , you became a follower of the oera linda book ? '', 
  the gdp of romania is 186 billion though . 
  it is also still not clear exactly how many people died in the crash . 
  it is widely believed that a lot of undocumented immigrants lived in that apartment building , and that many of them perished in the crash . 
  this issue , of course , is not strictly a conspiracy theory , but it is a sad reminder just how many complicating factors there were in this disaster . 
  a democidal maniac that caused the deaths of millions and had a huge country living in fear for a generation . 
  i think life in prison is a worse punishment than the death penalty , so no , i do not support capital punishment . 
  the added benefit of a life sentence is that you can still free wrongfully convicted people , if it ever turns out they are innocent . 
  it depends on the word . 
  my mother still does n't like it if i say * godverdomme * , but she does n't mind if i say * kut * , * tering * , and even sometimes * kanker * in certain contexts . 
  bless her catholic heart .
