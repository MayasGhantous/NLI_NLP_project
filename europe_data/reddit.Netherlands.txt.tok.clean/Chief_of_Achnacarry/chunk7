  my father never minded if i swore . 
  he does n't swear a lot himself , but i ca n't imagine he ever gave a damn if other people do . 
  the most prestigious towns in the netherlands are bloemendaal ( and surrounding villages like aerdenhout and vogelenzang ) , wassenaar , and most of the towns in the [ gooi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gooi ) region . 
  i myself grew up in a small village within the county borders of bloemendaal ( in a normal terraced house , not one of the big villas ) , and i have dealt with a lot of rich snobs throughout my life . 
  there are n't that many foreign snobs over there though . 
  this itinerary is unrealistic . 
  according to my calculations , you 'll waste about one-thirds of your holiday with the time it takes to go from place to place . 
  you 'll be travelling thousands of miles ( almost 3000 miles to be more exact ) in the span of just over two weeks . 
  it 'll wear you out and you wo n't be able to enjoy the cities and places you 'll be visiting properly . 
  you 'll be dealing with four different currencies ( british pound , euro , czech koruna , hungarian forint ) , many different transport systems , language barriers , four culture shocks after each other , and so on . 
  and all of this in the span of just over two weeks !, 
  my advice : pick two or three places that you really want to go to , and that are relatively close to each other . 
  research the crap out of their respective tourist attractions , and then visit those places at a really relaxed , laidback pace . 
  it 'll be much more enjoyable . 
  how about an italy trip ? 
  arrive in rome by plane , then spend five days in rome , then five days on the amalfi coast , and then another eight days somewhere in rural tuscany , from where you 'll be able to take day trips to siena , arezzo , pisa , and best of all : florence . 
  rent a car in/around rome , then drive from destination to destination . 
  at the end of the holiday , you drive back to rome to return the rental car , and then you can take the plane back to the us from there . 
  it is way more enjoyable and relaxed . 
  ( i have visited all those places in italy that i just listed , and i enjoyed it a lot ) . 
  i 'd say a considerable amount of mostly younger people were vaguely aware of his existence , yeah . 
  i highly doubt people like my parents ever heard of him before the elections though . 
  it is hard to define in a few sentences , but if you visit eastern europe it is very noticeable that there is a somewhat different ethos and macroculture . 
   but so is it in austria too [ ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria-hungary ), 
  [ dutch golden age painting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_golden_age_painting ), 
   it 's not as deadly to them , even though they 're the ones smoking . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  smoking is generally very unhealthy , ** especially ** for the smoker . 
  then there is no real point to smoking anymore . 
  yeah . 
  or they offered you one from their own pack and internally you went `` alright , guess this is my life now '' . 
  i feel bad at the thought that , afterwards , i introduced a few friends to smoking in a similar way . 
  i had a discussion about this very topic a week ago with some friends ( we 're in our early 20s now ) , who introduced who to what . 
  i am the one that introduced weed into my friend group , but ironically i barely smoke weed these days , whereas some of the friends i introduced it to are now relatively major potheads . 
  that 's funny , because slovenia is # 6 in the world by number of cigarettes per adult per year . 
   and also a lot of people fall into tobacco addiction because of peer pressure . 
  as you said , in my high school pretty much half the students smoked . 
  yeah this is the story for me and almost all of my friends . 
  i would n't describe it as peer * pressure * though . 
  no one ever gave non-smoking friends shit for it . 
  it was more like , when at parties , a little drunk , thinking `` smoking looks fun '' , saying : `` hey , can i have one ? '', 
  it was definitely a social thing , but more part of experimenting than peer pressure . 
  here it is 18 too nowadays , but it used to be 16 a few years ago . 
  i started smoking at the age of 15 and i usually had little problem finding places that did n't carefully check id . 
  once i was 16 , i usually took purchase orders from 15 y old friends ( i was a few months older than most of them ) . 
  that 's how it went for most of my peers too -- starting at 14-16 , getting smokes through a parent/older sibling/older friend , and so on . 
  that is not an answer to my question . 
  any good anecdotes ? 
   uva is the worst in my experience . 
  why ? 
  no one really thinks about nyenrode . 
  some people do n't even know it exists . 
   besides , their president is basically a nutjob and he 's pumping anti romanian propaganda all the time . 
  why is he doing that ? 
  as my uncle , who works at the vrije universiteit amsterdam , put it : all universities in the netherlands are pretty identical in terms of quality . 
  that being said : thirteen dutch universities are in the top 200 of the * times higher education world university ranking * , which means the netherlands is # 3 behind the us and the uk in terms of amount of universities in the top 200 . 
  no dutch university is among the absolute top though : the top spots are delft university of technology ( # 59 ) , university of amsterdam ( # 63 ) , wageningen university ( # 65 ) , erasmus university ( # 69 ) , leiden university ( # 77 ) , etc. . . etc. . . https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/locations/nl/sort_by/scores_overall/sort_order/asc/cols/stats edit : updated some info, 
  i know , 
   guess i 'm not particularly fond of ... the things that are in our east .

  i went shooting with an ar-15 in the us this summer . 
  i felt very american that day . 
  only in america . . 
  * sikfff * - my dad, 
  yes , but `` ja toch '' / `` niet dan '' is purely ironic . 
  it is not used in a serious manner to indicate interest . 
  oh , i was wondering if it was only popular in leiden . 
  once , in an amsterdam coffeeshop ^ 1 , i struck up conversation with a couple of lads from liverpool , who had an accent so thick and difficult to understand that i had trouble following what they were saying half of the time . 
  -- ^ ( 1 : coffeeshop being a dutch euphemism for a place where you buy weed , not drink coffee ), 
  i have a very specific one . 
  so , a lot of my friends are in college and there is an ironic `` memey '' expression that is popular over there that goes like this : person a : `` ja t\u00f3ch ! '', 
  person b : `` niet dan ! '', 
  it imitates the standard replies lower class middle-aged women from the rotterdam area use during gossip/small talk . 
  it roughly means something like `` is n't it ? '', 
  `` it is ! '', 
  now , you can yell `` ja toch ! '', 
  in a mall and you 'll hear five different people respond `` niet d\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1n ! '' . 
  but people also do this a lot in the middle of group conversations , and they get absolutely derailed by it . 
  the joke has become old and stale in my humble opinion . 
  do you study in leiden ? 
  but [ football ** is ** war ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/rinus_michels ), 
  i got the impression that , despite his arrogance , trump seems to be ( somewhat ) susceptible to outside influences , in particular those of cunning career politicians like mike pence . 
  i mean , trump is completely clueless . 
  he might be arrogant , but he is going to rely on the judgments of his henchmen in difficult decisions . 
  he has always operated that way . 
   i do n't think creationism is taken seriously by any party in europe , in the west at least the dutch [ reformed political party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reformed_political_party ) , which has seats in both the dutch senate and the dutch house of representatives , supports young earth creationism and is opposed to the idea of evolution . 
  economically liberal in the european sense of the word , or the american sense of the word ? 
  because they are most certainly not economically liberal in the american sense of the word . 
   fwiw our newly elected president trump has actually never said he has any problem whatsoever with the lgbtq community and has no intention to meddle with the supreme court decision . 
  however , mike pence will almost certainly try to influence trump 's supreme court picks , in order to force a return towards `` traditional marriage '' . 
  i live about 150 kilometres away from my parents , which in the netherlands means i live almost on the other side of the country . 
  most of my family still lives in friesland , as i am ethnically frisian . 
  some of my more distant family members emigrated to canada a while back . 
  why do you refer to front national as `` alt-right '' ? 
  you do realize that front national was founded in 1972 , and that the le pens have been in french politics for decades now ? 
  way before your 2016 political buzzword was introduced . 
  why is it spelled gymru instead of cymru ? 
  it is exactly the same in the netherlands , but for some reason my teachers in german language class in high school always insisted that germans were much more polite and formal with their use of the word `` sie '' .
