well the same comic could be made about poland right ? 
  yet they 're one of the most religious countries . 
  the only migrants allowed to reside in the netherlands are either people classified as refugees , eu citizens , or people having a special permit . 
  typical irish scene in the background . 
  what do you mean ? 
  no one is allowed in just for work or poor economic circumstances at home . 
  you can only get asylum if you are classified as a refugee according to the geneva convention : `` a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it . . '', 
  in short , because companies wanted cheap labourers . 
  after wwii , unemployment was a major issue in the netherlands , and the government even stimulated people to emigrate . 
  this , combined with a fear for wwiii , massive housing shortages meant that many ( particularly young couples ) decided to seek their future elsewhere , mainly in canada , the us , south africa , australia and new zealand . 
  until 1961 , the dutch population was declining , and as the economy boomed as elsewhere in western europe , there were massive labour shortages . 
  in contrast , turkey had a massive population growth combined with a backwards economy and unemployment . 
  from the 60s , turks started coming to the netherlands , on invitation from companies to work in the netherlands . 
  some also came on own initiative . 
  in 1964 , the dutch government made a ` recruitment agreement ' with the turkish government , giving companies the ability to recruit labourers . 
  this dramatically increased the number of turks coming to the netherlands . 
  this agreement lasted until 1974 . 
  initially , it was thought that turks would only stay in the netherlands temporarily , make some money and return when the economic situation in turkey had improved . 
  however , the wage and cost of living in the netherlands meant that they did not make much , while the turkish economy did not really improve . 
  they brought their families over and stayed mostly . 
  in recent times however , there is a trend of turks returning to turkey . 
  yes i agree , it was rushed and not thought through enough , but turks are here now and we have to deal with it . 
  concluding that it was a mistake does not really help solve current problems . 
  `` we '' do n't . 
  turks can not migrate from turkey to the netherlands , unless they are part of family reunification , which seldom happens anymore . 
  the only turks that came to the netherlands were part of a government scheme of labour migration . 
  turks in the netherlands are all either gastarbeiters or their offspring/family , not turks migrating in recent times . 
  actually , in recent times , there is more turkish emigration than immigration .

  you 'd deport people born and raised here ? 
   shakira law waka waka eh eh, 
  can i ask what you are referring to ? 
  wait what ? 
  yes i know . 
  i really should n't say anything as our one language community just elected 13 different parties to parliament , whereas the belgian federal parliament seats just 12 different ones . 
  no problem . 
  i must say i did not even know all these parties , our neigbours sure have quite the collection of parties along with their collection of 6 governments . 
  [ here 's the wikipedia link . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_next_belgian_federal_election ) ** for wallonia ** red - parti socialiste - social democrats blue - mouvement r\u00e9formateur - ( conservative ) liberals maroon - parti du travail de belgique - leftists green - ecolo - greens orange - centre d\u00e9mocrate humaniste - christiandemocrats purple - parti populaire - right-wing belgian unionists pink - d\u00e9fi - social liberals ** for flanders ** yellow - nieuw vlaamse alliantie - centre-right flemish nationalists orange - christendemocraten & vlaams - christiandemocrats red - socialistische partij anders - social democrats blue - open vld - liberals green - groen - greens brown - vlaams belang - flemish nationalists ( akin to wilders & le pen ) maroon - pvda ( flemish wing of ptb ), 
  a popular election to decide who will become head of state will divide the country before said person is even in office . 
  however much i dislike the birthright and its randomness , it is actually a good thing with regards to a unifying role . 
  first of all i want to state that i am just explaining a sentiment which i do not agree with myself . 
   catholicism was part of their identity so that about as solid a link as there is between islamic terrorism and the general muslim population . 
  well i was n't talking about that link at all . 
  i meant that there is a sentiment that islam could be a threat , not that all muslims are dangerous . 
  the difference is that ira 's terrorism did not have a catholic motive , and was not justified by religious texts for instance , whereas a big chunk of islamic terrorism is . 
   we 'll see what happens with albania and bosnia . 
  i answered this before in this thread : first of all turkey is a lot bigger than any of these countries , with a population that sits only just behind germany , and would thus be the second biggest state in the eu and have massive impact after joining . 
  bosnia and albania would not have remotely the same impact if they were to join , with both countries having a population of roughly 3 million people . 
  furthermore , bosnia ( 3m ) is very multicultural and just about 50 % muslim and albania ( 3m ) is 57 % muslim , whereas turkey is 95 % muslim . 
  also there is the geographical reality that makes it a lot harder to ignore them , despite islam being the dominant religion . 
   why do they need to be seen as caused by islam ? 
  the eu or the reforms of its members were n't seen as caused by catholicism or another religion either . 
  for me they do n't , i was just stating that it might change the sentiment regarding islam . 
  well , i 'll think you 'll find many a person that believes that european-style democracy is actually based on typical `` christian values '' , unfortunately . 
   it just needs to be illustrated that it 's not a barrier , that 's all . 
  as i have been arguing , i really do n't think that is all it takes for turkish membership . 
  the islamic sentiment , their size , the fact they border syria and iraq are just too much to convince enough important people i think . 
   ira , being catholic terrorism the ira 's terrorism was not remotely catholic , they did not have any catholic motives , just the desire to bring about a united ireland . 
   europe is unable to abide by eu standards please do n't put words in my mouth , i did not say that because there is major islamic terrorism ( which i meant in a global , not turkish perspective ) , turkey is unable to abide by eu standards , rather that as long as there is major islamic terrorism , people 's and politician 's opinion would prevent a 95 % muslim country from joining the eu , however much they reform ( and if they do maybe deserve to join the eu )  it does n't need to be seen to be caused by islam , i never said that - do n't put words into my mouth . 
  i never claimed you did . 
  however if reforms were to be seen as being caused by islam , that might actually change the opinion preventing a reformed turkey from joining , but as i said i do n't think potential reforms will ever be seen as caused by islam . 
  first of all turkey is a lot bigger than any of these countries , with a population that sits only just behind germany , and would thus be the second biggest state in the eu and have massive impact after joining . 
  bosnia ( 3m ) is very multicultural and just about 50 % muslim , albania ( 3m ) is 57 % muslim , whereas turkey is 95 % muslim . 
  as for cyprus ( 1m ) , 25 % is muslim , and yes the mostly muslim turkish part is de jure part of the eu , while not de facto . 
  there are muslims living all over the eu , but not in muslim dominated political entities . 
  as for kosovo , i do n't see them joining any time soon , as they are not even recognised by all eu member states , not even considering the problems it would give with fellow eu-candidate serbia . 
  by the way : i am not saying i agree with it , but i do think the claim that an almost completely muslim country would not be let in the union is true . 
  thanks . 
   turks here probably burst into laughter upon reading this . 
  he was fully in bed with the gulenists ( wrote for their paper , probably had other ties as well ) . 
  i am aware of this , hence why i 'm asking so much . 
  i just stated that i got most of my information about turkey from him . 
  however , i guess everyone has their ties and their preferences , and zaman was one of the last papers that was not controlled by pro-erdogan factors . 
  ironically , in the netherlands he is actually sometimes seen as an erdogan apologist , also defending free speech for those turkish ministers that wanted to speech in the netherlands last month . 
  so i think he might be less biased than you think . 
  having been in the greenleft party hardly smells like a biased conservative islamist to me either . 
  from my perspective he always seemed like an intelligent man , however when i read your post he at least associated himself with the islamist surge and i can totally understand where you 're coming from . 
   they -- correctly -- think that any kind of social liberalism backed by the law here would be destructive to their islamist movement this does seem to support the assesment that erdogan might not be an outright dictator , but rather someone that adapts in whatever way to stay in power . 
   the ` democratic reforms ' that people talk about do not concern things like freedom of expression , assembly , press , the law on political parties and such but the structure of the security apparatus , death penalty ah i did not know this , does indeed seem like gesture politics and measures to consolidate power . 
   many conspiracy theories were circulating then ( it was clear us wanted to enter iraq and that government was adamantly against that and would not have helped , for example ) . 
  so what ? 
   election threshold . 
  the other parties on the ` right ' were pushed under % 10 ( one almost got in with 9.8 % or something ) . 
  still the islamists doubled their vote ? 
  wikipedia cites an economic recession . 
  jesus , only now i realise that only \u00b1 53,5 % of the voters actually gained representation in parliament after the 2002 elections , that is ridiculous ... one does question if erdogan ever gained a legitimate mandate to rule ...  he barely crossed 50 % a few times as he barely won the referendum , despite obvious advantage and ( at least partially ) support from the mhp , do you think erdogan might lose the next presidential elections ? 
  an alliance between the chp & mhp seems key i think . 
   the western response was to that bloody coup attempt here and were convinced that if it had succeeded the response from the west would be friendly to the ensuing regime . 
  what do you think of the * west 's * reaction to the coupe ? 
  i think they might be right in saying that the west would not have minded erdogan losing power , to me it also seemed as though many people believed that it was a plot from erdogan to strengthen his position . 
  the statement by bildt does seem ridiculous about a party censoring and jailing people for their opinions , however the charges were anti-secularism , which seem weird from a western perspective . 
  afaik there 's not really a culture of banning parties in the west , except for germany and neo-nazi 's and spain and basque parties supporting the eta . 
   well , echr refused to act on tr vs. refah previously was n't it the turkish court itself that decided not to ban the akp ? 
   oh i do n't think he had that kind of influence . 
  ikr , the claim seemed quite far-stretched to me too . 
  yes . 
  yes . 
  you and i agree 100 % , i even considered typing something along those lines in my original message . 
  however , i think many almost every christian-democrat will disagree .
