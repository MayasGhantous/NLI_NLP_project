there is almost no belgian nationalism in belgium en wie zijn die debiele belgicisten die steeds weer \u00e9\u00e9n of andere maffe demonstratie voeren ? 
  `` necessary education '' ? 
  you mean the required prior levels for being admitted ? 
   and countries keep their sovereignty , are you fucking kidding me ? 
  if this sovereign debt crisis keeps going like this eventually even germany may have to hand over its sovereignty to the eurocrats so they can bail-out the rest of the piigs with a blank check from the north european countries . 
  a couple of weeks ago someone came along asking about groningen in / r/travel ( at least , i * think * it was in / r/travel . 
  you tend to notice , since groningen is n't quite the metropolis of which millions of travelers might ask information about . ), 
  see ... that 's what you get for adding `` in '' in front of `` formateur '' ;-), 
   but if garibaldi 's troops invaded italy today , they would encounter a country in a state of shock and sharply divided -- between north and south i 'm curious , what is the location of this mythical north-south divide ? 
  at least in belgium they have very clearly delineated internal borders , both physical as well as mental . 
  lol !, 
  ... and suddenly half the country will be walking around looking like father time . 
  my first thought when reading this article was about massive inflows of hot investment money . 
  with zirp ruling the roost everywhere in the western world , investors looking for pretty much any kind of return are piling into the so-called emerging markets . 
  god speed turkey !, 
  i wish you the best . 
  just do n't let a dubai happen to you too . 
  you just know when articles like these appear that the subject matter jumped the shark . 
  this is an eu swan song if there ever was one . 
  the continent will be better without it . 
  the eu will implode on itself one way or another . 
  it 'll be ironic , since the original purpose was to prevent wars , that it will be disagreements among the member states induced * because * of centralization of competencies and collectivization of debts ( among other things one-size-fits-all ) that potentially makes us go to war again . 
  i 'm so jealous of you swiss , that you opted to stay the fuck out of this bureaucracy . 
   besides the fact that it ca n't tell the difference between a continent and an undemocratic institution ^ this man understands the concept . 
  the rest of you superstate lovers are just willfully blind to the difference . 
  the eu is n't a country . 
  the eu is n't a continent . 
  the eu is n't even a grain of sand . 
  the cartoon speaks of what * europe * has or has n't done . 
  well , `` europe '' is a misnomer . 
  europe did n't have any role in anything . 
  the eu did . 
  and * that * is my beef with the whole concept of substituting `` europe '' for `` eu '' because it reeks of newspeak . 
  i get that . 
  but nonetheless , in the case of europe , america and usa all are arguably pieces of land , whereas the eu is * not * a piece of land . 
  it is still only an institution whose bureaucrats would * very very much * like to become one big state ( the european superstate . ), 
  that will never happen . 
  we europeans are simply far too different from each other to get along like that in the long term . 
  europe still consists of sovereign countries with separate governments , treasuries , militaries etc. 
  if they take that away then you 'll see how quickly dormant nationalist sentiments boil over !, 
  hell , if anything , just look at the flemish-walloon impasse ; before you know it even belgium might cease to exist before the eu gets its way . 
  i 'll drink to that !, 
  even 3/4 century of soviet rule could n't prevent the whole thing unraveling again into one big warring tangle of constituent countries . 
  the eussr wo n't be any different ; europe 's history is strewn with alliances that broke , mended , broke and mended again only to be broken again . 
  it 's almost destiny . 
  for once thing , people need to stop calling it `` europe '' when they actually mean `` the eu . '', 
  `` europe '' is a continent ( ok , and a band ) not the bureaucratic institution seated in brussels . 
  that fucking shit is called the eu !, 
  the bureacritters really love it that everybody confuses the two . 
  subconsciously gives them more cover and more legitimacy . 
  ^ absolutely true . 
  100 % especially this part :  anyone trying to stand out above the rest becomes a target to be shot down asap . 
  the thing with gdp is that as a country you can add and double-count figures to make it look impressive . 
  simple off-the-cuff example : an identical dental procedure might cost $ 100 in france but cost $ 5000 in the us . 
  the result is the same ( e.g. 
  the patient gets better can get back to work and be more productive ) but \\* bam ! \\* the us gets to add up a higher amount . 
  then there 's also the whole thing about what counts as `` production '' ? 
  or maybe it 's just consumption ? 
  or neither in a country where dental care might be `` free '' ? 
  there 's all kinds of technicalities and each country has it 's own laws and regulations which distort that figure ( which again can be very convenient to an unpopular or inept gov ' t looking for some good news to trumpet around . ), 
  take gdp numbers with a huge bucket of salt . 
  i actually hope their entire economy grinds to a halt so they realize that their constant strikes are n't without consequences . 
  that 's what you get when a huge portion of the population is both nearing retirement * and * part of a public union ... the rest of the `` republic '' gets the shaft . 
  how about some place completely off the beaten path ? 
  pick an island in the baltic like bornholm , oland , gotland , \u00c5land or hiiumaa/saaremaa to discover ex-soviet bunkers and lighthouses . 
  or any of the myriad smaller frisian islands . 
  i 've read that there 's even a recently opened race track on gotland too if you 're into that . 
  no idea if it 's in season though . 
  if you want something balmier there 's always the mediterranean . 
  might be much cheaper now that it 's somewhat out of season . 
   any specific destinations in and around netherlands ( or a neighbouring country ) that may be of interest ? 
  i 'm inclined to say `` any city that was n't bombed to smithereens during wwii '' ;-) those still have the characteristic old streets , quaint plazas and buildings . 
  otherwise : i much prefer to head to flanders ( just to the south ) ... brugge and antwerpen are well worth a day each . 
  if you 're into beers , `` bier restaurant gambrinus de koning '' is my fave spot in brugge . 
  i think they have around 500 beers ready to order there and the food is * made * with the beers . 
  i 've also heard gent is great too but i have n't been there myself . 
  a bit further east from there : luik , maastricht and aachen are also nice * and * student-y . 
  [ edit ] as i replied below : i did n't mean that rotterdam and utrecht are the only two places within the randstad worth a visit . 
  i was just naming those two as preferable to the similar-sized amsterdam . 
  together with the hague these make the four largest dutch cities . 
  leiden and delft are nice too and the bigger towns on the north holland peninsula too . 
  heck , that pretty much makes an arc along the coast from rotterdam to groningen !, 
  heh , i had a feeling after i finished typing that i was gon na catch some flak from leiden and maybe delft . 
  ;-) i was actually thinking that i should mention like one of the bigger ( - ish ) cities . 
  excellent choice . 
  as a dutchman myself , i 'm of the opinion that amsterdam \\*\\* is vastly overrated . 
  to experience something more reminiscent of the stereotypical imagery of `` dutchness '' you ca n't go wrong with groningen . 
  \\*\\* actually , the whole * randstad * agglomeration of which amsterdam is a part is n't much different from concrete jungles elsewhere . 
  except for the occasional very old building here and there for the requisite photo-op . 
  oh ... and more bicycles than humans . 
  if you must go to the randstad region , then rotterdam and/or utrecht are nicer places to visit imo . 
  amsterdam today is a gentrified , nanny-fied , never-ending [ bouwput ] ( http://images.google.com/images?q=bouwput ) with all sorts of stupid rules recently put in place to keep things quiet after a certain hour and you ca n't even drink your beer anymore while standing in front of the pub . 
  you 'll just be tripping over the other tourists and balkan drug traffickers and finding museums closed for renovations . 
   * i hear this argument from the ** eu ** that it 's inherently good . 
  * that is your answer . 
  the eu gov ' t is in most aspects no different than the politburo . 
  i recently saw the * no reservations - istanbul * episode and it was exactly like i imagined it when i first read about the place some years ago . 
  just like the people ; eclectic , beautiful , friendly , pretty much an all-round nice place . 
  now , having said that , i also believe that about 97 % of the rest of the country does n't come close to the modernity and secularism on display in that tv show . 
  unfortunately that modern kind of turk is not what eu countries get through immigration .
