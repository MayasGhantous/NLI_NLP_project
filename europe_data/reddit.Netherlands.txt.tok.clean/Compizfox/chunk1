could you eleborate ? 
  as far as i know , reddit 's formatting does n't consider apostrophes as links . 
  links are made with [ link text ] ( url ) . 
  however , reddit does consider text between two backticks ( ` ) as a code block , like here : ` test `, 
  your use of apostrophes is fine , it 's just that ` is n't an apostrophe  ` is a backtick . 
  it 's not really used as a separate character as far as i know . 
  in some languages it is used as an accent , like in the french word \u00e0 . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grave_accent ) ' is an apostrophe . 
  yep . 
  it lacks a legend though ... 
  oh i get it , you mean a pair ( woman + child ) . 
  i had n't considered that . 
  we did it reddit !, 
  uh , ok , if you want to be * really * specific  in that case `` women and children '' is nonsensical because the intersection of women and children is empty . 
  ( ` women \u2229 children = \u2205 ` ), 
  yeah , i know that 's what op meant . 
  but technically that is the union of women and children ( ` women \u222a children ` ) , which is equivalent to ` women or children ` . 
  ` women and children ` is something else , namely the intersection between women and children ( ` women \u2229 children ` ) . 
  yeah it should be `` women * or * children '' . 
  `` women * and * children '' means female children . 
  absolutely . 
  but do n't ever underestimate the stupidity of the average person . 
  good comparison . 
  and it 's really true , i do n't think dutch people feel that cycling is more dangerous ( as in , fall injury ) than running . 
  and that is because it is n't , as long as you are very confident/proficient in cycling ( like everybody is in the netherlands ) . 
  also we do n't have to cycle on busy roads between cars or something , we have dedicated cycling lanes . 
  we do n't . 
  no but seriously , the risk is just very low . 
  i think i 've only fallen 2 times in my life ( not including early childhood ) and both times it was nothing too serious besides some abrasions on my hands . 
  nobody in the netherlands wears helmets for normal , casual cycling ( you know , to school or to work ) . 
  however , for bicycle racing ( the sport ) , cyclists do wear helmets . 
  i guess that 's because the risk of falling while at high speed on a road is higher than low-speed cycling on a bicycle lane . 
  you 're right , but these governments are n't really visible . 
  not by far as visible as a state is in the us . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/nederlandseprovincieslarge.png ) like / u/obraka already said , the netherlands does n't have states . 
  zeeland ( not to be confused with new zealand ) is a province of the netherlands . 
  it 's not a state , it is nothing more than a region . 
  wait , is that real ? 
  or are the open doors obscuring something ? 
  so , no more online banking in britain ? 
  also british citizens will no longer have access to things like their email since every ( good ) provider forces ssl/starttls for imap/smtp ? 
  david cameron is a fucking idiot . 
  u mad ? 
  we never did . 
  http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/6752749/cccf0868/hans_sloopt_erdogan.html we need english subs on this one ... 
  some weird panorama projection probably . 
  islamism is political islam . 
  sharia law and stuff , but not necessarily terrorism . 
  and this wants into the eu ... 
   it means exactly that . 
  if they had actual proof it would n't be called theory . 
  difference here is that there is someone that did something more than post on forum which could be anything from making two posts to actual research study peer reviewed . 
  that 's absolutely incorrect . 
  in science , * theory * does n't imply that it is unproven . 
  all scientific knowledge is contained in theories . 
  gravity is a theory . 
  relativity is a theory . 
  evolution is a theory . 
  quantum mechanics is a theory . 
  none of these things are `` unproven '' ^ 1 . 
  if you do n't believe me , [ the wikipedia article about scientific theories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientific_theory ) starts of with saying exactly this :  scientific theories are the most reliable , rigorous , and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge . 
  [ 6 ] this is significantly different from the common usage of the word `` theory '' , which implies that something is a conjecture , hypothesis , or guess ( i.e. , unsubstantiated and speculative ) . 
  [ 7 ] 1 : actually , it 's not really correct to talk about `` proven '' in this context because you ca n't really prove * any * scientific theory . 
  scientific theories must be falsifiable , which means that it must be possible to disprove them . 
  but you ca n't conclusively prove any of them , you can only * verify * them by doing experiments that yield results in accordance with the theory . 
   theory is good word here . 
  a * theory * in science does n't mean the same thing as it does in everyday speech . 
   problem is that theory only works when you assume that homosexualism is a feature not a problem . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it provides an evolutionary reason for homosexuality . 
  nothing more than that . 
  ever heard about the [ gay uncle theory ] ( http://www.livescience.com/6106-gay-uncles-pass-genes.html ) ? 
  can confirm . 
  this happens all the time . 
  it 's called a [ contested border ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_territorial_disputes ) . 
  [ google maps even shows borders differently depending on which country you 're visiting from . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/09/economist-explains-1 ), 
  good point , but i think his argument is that the one is ironically more strictly enforced than the other . 
  to be clear , i do n't know if this is really the case , i 'm just paraphrasing baumgartner . 
  funnily enough , that would apply mostly to holland . 
  i 've never seen this or heard about it . 
  ignorant of the fact that not everybody in the world speaks english in daily life . 
  yes , we ( dutchmen ) do speak english pretty well . 
  no , that does n't mean that we speak english instead of dutch when we 're in our own country ( and not speaking to foreigners ) . 
  you 're trolling , right ? 
  are you serious ? 
  yes , most of us speak english , but we 're are n't replacing our native language with it . 
  i really do n't understand why you would expect dutch people to speak english in their own country . 
  are you really that ignorant ? 
  you realise that this is in the netherlands right ? 
  that 's cute . 
  i 've always wondered how these kind of adblock-detectors work . 
  you would think that it should n't be possible to detect these , right ? 
  ca n't the adblocker just not show the ad to the user , but without removing it from the dom ? 
  that 's because it was spelled wrong in dutch . 
  it should be `` ik ken niemand die ze bewust aanlaat . '' . 
  * aanlaten * is one single verb . 
  huh , til . 
  we have fuses and residual-current circuit breakers installed in the meter cupboard ( is that a correct translation ? ) . 
  they protect the whole house at once , so no need for separate fuses inside the plugs .
