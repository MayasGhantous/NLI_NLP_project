  schuko and french plugs/sockets are intercompatible . 
  no they do n't , you 're confusing them with antipsychotics . 
  no , yours do ? 
  i 've never had `` a plug stopped working '' . 
  well , we surrendered before the ultimatum but the nazis got the memo too late or something so they bombed rotterdam anyways . 
  edit : it read up about it and it 's a bit more complicated . 
  negotiations ( between general schmidt and colonel scharroo ) where underway and the ultimatum was postponed . 
  the order was given to abort the bombing of rotterdam . 
  however , this abort order was n't received by the bomber formation for some reason . 
  we will just upgrade our water defenses . 
  this is false , and [ this excellent comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/4bgorq/sky_sports_news_breaking_belgium_national_team/d190y5k ) explains why better than i can . 
  some years ago some ( male ) journalists here put on a burqa and went to vote with a burqa , using a woman 's id . 
  they succeeded , too . 
  i believe they improved it the year after though . 
  not all , wind and solar do n't use steam turbines . 
  dutch article by the professor himself : http://www.nrc.nl/next/2016/05/10/hier-heb-je-mijn-turkse-medaille-terug-erdogan-1617690, 
  they do n't do that in other countries ? 
  do you truly think companies like action produce their products in the netherlands ? 
  hint : they do n't . 
  the stuff they sell is almost always made in china . 
  often i find the exact same product in the action or aldi that i also found on chinese webshops . 
  their suppliers may be based in the netherlands , but they do n't produce it here . 
  that would simply not be profitable . 
  historical reasons , afaik . 
  water is quite an important topic here in the netherlands . 
  the [ water boards ( waterschappen ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_board_%28netherlands%29 ) are also one of the oldest forms of local government here , and to this day we still have elections for it . 
  we do not have elections for other kinds of authorities . 
  all websites that use big ad networks are almost guaranteed to serve malware once in a while . 
  not just sketchy ones . 
  i must have misread/misunderstood that somewhere . 
  or maybe the dutch cookie law was/is different in that regard from the european one ? 
  in any case , why is it that cookie walls always have an excuse in them that the website does n't work without these cookies ? 
  if the law only requires website to inform users about * tracking * cookies that means they are simply lying . 
  and even for purely tracking cookies this law is unhelpful for users that already block ads and trackers : the scripts that place the cookies are not even executed in that case but you still have to accept that stupid warning . 
  ~ ~ the problem is that it does not distinguish between tracking cookies ( from ad networks and analytics ) and functional cookies ( for sessions ) . ~ ~ the result is that basically every website that bothers to comply with this law has this warning . 
  edit : nvm , i was wrong about that . 
  i have that `` prebake '' list in my ublock origin but i often encounter websites where it breaks the entires website : it only displays a blank page or whatever , and i have to disable ublock origin , agree to the cookies and enable it again to use the website . 
  it 's as if instead of blocking the cookie warning it inadvertently blocks the entire website . 
  that 's correct , but ad networks frequently distribute malware . 
  not in the cookies or whatever , but simply as a download . 
  the user has to execute that download of course , there 's no way that can happen without user intervention ( apart from browser exploits , which are not a serious concern if you keep your browser/os up to date and do n't use any legacy plugins such as flash ) . 
  of course . 
  not giving credit to rightful authors is plagiarism , which is distinct from copyright infringement . 
  yes , i see the distinction you 're making . 
  it should be valued , but i do n't think sharing undermines that value . 
  typically it 's not the book authors who are advocating for copyright laws ; it 's the publishers who can preserve their artificial monopoly on distribution that way . 
  authors just want their works to be read , and copyright does not exactly help that . 
  i think all information , books too , should be legal to share freely . 
  no one should be able to control what information other people can or can not share . 
  copyright is an artificial construct originally designed for censorship that should not exist . 
  i swear i can recognise the navy seal copypasta no matter what language it is in . 
  the sentence structure alone is distinctive enough . 
  shot , not killed . 
  the cop is doing fine .

  the germans have dug holes in all of them . 
  i always found the name `` czech republic '' long in english . 
  in dutch it is `` tsjechi\u00eb '' , which is very similar ( in pronunciation ) to `` czechia '' . 
  actually , `` industrial grade potatoes '' do exist . 
  it 's a distinct variety that 's not meant for consumption and it 's used for making starch . 
  that would be mt.

  / r/data _ irl, 
  this is why websites need hsts . 
  he actually ** is ** head of state and the netherlands is a ( constitutional ) monarchy . 
  but he does n't have any real power , the position is mostly ceremonial . 
  we have a [ cabinet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabinet_of_the_netherlands ) headed by our prime minister that has the actual executive power . 
  latin and ancient greek are taught in gymnasium ( highest level secondary education ) but nobody is fluent in them . 
  you only learn to translate from these languages , not to speak them . 
  you donate money after you graduated ? 
  like paying thousands of tuition was not enough ? 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqzkks5shcm ), 
  we just have separate lanes for the different directions ( with separate lights ) for most intersections with traffic lights . 
  if turning right is `` free '' ( not conflicting with other directions that have a green ) the light for the right lane will be green . 
  usually the universities ( here in my country , at least ) want * more * foreign students instead of less because ( non-eu ) foreign students pay much more tuition . 
  of course . 
  very few games have dutch translations in the first place , and the translations of the games that have them are often frankly cringeworthy . 
  i usually play in english with english subtitles on . 
  it 's not that i ca n't understand it without subtitles , but i 'm always afraid that i 'll miss something :p in some cases i play games in the original language if it is not english . 
  for example , i played metro 2033 and metro : last light in russian and the witcher in polish , with english subtitles of course . 
  in these cases it 's just because the original voice acting is much better . 
  yes , we do n't take off our shoes at the doorstep if that 's what you mean . 
  but when i 'm home for a long period i 'll usually take them off . 
  we do n't expect our guests to take their shoes off and doing so would be pretty weird here . 
  well extremes are never good but i do think it 's important that teachers are paid a salary that is competitive with what the business sector pays . 
  if that 's not the case , nobody wants to be a teacher and all the good teachers do something else instead , and schools are forced to hire unqualified teachers because they are not allowed to offer a higher salary . 
  in the netherlands we have the opposite problem and schools are sometimes forced to hire underqualified teachers . 
  actually , yes . 
  inches are used for two specific measurements : screen diagonals and wheel sizes . 
  the website does have a certificate but it appears to be self-signed or signed by a ca that is not in the trust store ( fnmt-rcm ) . 
  if you have some way of verifying the legitimacy of this ca 's root certificate you could always add it manually to your trust store . 
  but only do that if you know what you 're doing . 
   fibre wifi, 
  i 've had dutch , english , french and german in school ( and ancient greek and latin , but those do n't really count ) but i 'm only fluent in english and dutch . 
  i can reasonably understand german ( not in the last place because it is so similar to dutch ; you can almost translate it word-for-word ) but i 'm not comfortable speaking it . 
  i forgot most of the french , i 'm afraid . 
  basically everyone in the netherlands speaks at least english as second language , with german being the second most common i think . 
  / thread, 
  we have more bikes than inhabitants . 
   you can not hear any difference in the spoken language as you can not really hear spaces .
