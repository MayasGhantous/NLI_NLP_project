never expected to find any other ex-erasmianen here on / r/europe !, 
  i flew from schiphol amsterdam to reykjavik to nyc this summer because it was like 10-15 % cheaper than a direct flight , but hey that 's just some anecdotal evidence . 
  we 're still ahead in the human development index , whoo !, 
  take that , finland !,

  not only in the netherlands , but also in for example the us amongst older people . 
  i still wonder who in their right mind would call their son dick in an english speaking country . 
  i 'm not at all versed in the subject but i was afraid you were n't getting the gist of the original comment . 
  it 's kinda late for me to analyse these stats though because my critical thinking skills vanish at around midnight :p / u/donvito should probably chime in with his own opinion sometime later . 
  i 'm guessing / u/donvito was actually sarcastic , since nuclear fission when performed correctly is less polluting and generally bad for the environment than most conventional ways of generating power ( think coal , gass and the likes ) . 
  here is what it 'll look like when crimea becomes part of russia , and it may shock some of you : its color changes from greyish to yellow !, 
  sometimes the comments on here are so horribly simplistic and over the top that it just seems like a markov chain with input from stormfront . 
  the netherlands have a terrace , confirmed for being more gezellig . 
  also , [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a0w8els.png ) never gets old . 
  relentless cynicism is way too often mistaken for wit and intelligence by the cynics themselves . 
  just enjoy the gesture and do n't be such a downer about it . 
  hey there !, 
  to be perfectly clear , i just made this post after seeing some posts from / r/t _ d on / r/all comparing sweden to some third world country while simultaneously showcasing unwavering hyperpatriotism towards the us . 
  hence this post . 
  okay , i 'm getting slightly tired from commenting this over and over again , but here it is . 
  see my parent level comment , where i post the site i used and the sources the site itself uses . 
  you can even tinker around yourself and compare different countries with each other , it 's pretty fun .

  sure thing , just like how the democratic people 's republic of korea is a bastion of democracy !, 
  not a liberal tho . 
  eco-socialism all the way !, 
  sweden was actually neutral during both world wars !, 
  so they were n't occupied at all . 
  not really , for some reason the site i used decided to display it like that so it does require some on-the-go math if you want standardized metrics . 
  expressionism works until you run out of other people 's subjective versions of reality . 
  80 percent of my messages have been `` but what about refugee rape ? '', 
  with some lovely personal attacks sprinkled throughout .

  nah , it 's just mostly in response to your president shit talking countries just to make their base compliant and afraid .

  ivan , i have been foiled again, 
  class divide is calculated with the gini-coefficient . 
  here 's a short excerpt from ifitweremyhome.com itself : `` this index measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of family income in a country . 
  the index is calculated from the lorenz curve , in which cumulative family income is plotted against the number of families arranged from the poorest to the richest . 
  the index is the ratio of ( a ) the area between a country 's lorenz curve and the 45 degree helping line to ( b ) the entire triangular area under the 45 degree line . 
  the more nearly equal a country 's income distribution , the closer its lorenz curve to the 45 degree line and the lower its gini index , e.g. , a scandinavian country with an index of 25 . 
  the more unequal a country 's income distribution , the farther its lorenz curve from the 45 degree line and the higher its gini index , e.g. , a sub-saharan country with an index of 50 . 
  if income were distributed with perfect equality , the lorenz curve would coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero ; if income were distributed with perfect inequality , the lorenz curve would coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis and the index would be 100 .

  since rape statistics seem to be a recurring theme in the comments , i 'd like to clarify that the definition of rape is much wider in sweden than in most other countries , which makes their rape rate bloated and makes comparisons with other countries quite difficult . 
  again , reposting my previous comment .

  in case you 're not beings sarcastic , trump is a major topic over here . 
  especially when he does something unexpected ( pretty often ) or when he talks about a european country . 
  which is sadly really hard to get into and way too expensive for the majority of people . 
  i 'd prefer a solid higher education system like we have over here ( with 3 universities in the global top 100 on a population of 17 million ) that is largely paid for by the state .

  of course pissing matches are useless and promote nationalism , but i made this post in response to the lies of trump and the fear mongering going on over at t_d . 
  just made a new post to be honest . 
  iirc we actually work the shortest work weeks of all of europe , but are more efficient during the few hours we work . 
  live and let live !, 
  if you like the country you were born in , do n't let other people tell you to move . 
  however , i just wanted to respond to the lies of trump from the past month with this post .

  `` with all of / r/t _ d 's talk about how dangerous and unsafe life in sweden is ... '', 
  getting our defence spending back to 2 % of our gdp is actually something i find very important . 
  and of course i wo n't move to america if i do n't like it over there . 
  however , your current president is knowingly ( or just due to incompetence , i do n't know which is worse ) misleading your people using lies about european countries . 
  using lies about an allied nation as a sort of boogeyman is a disgrace , and it should n't come as a surprise that we want to give a counterpoint to these allegations . 
  when mainstream european politicians start shit talking the us and lying about living conditions there , you would want to defend yourselves as well . 
  wow , that sounds like quite a story !, 
  feel like typing it out ?
