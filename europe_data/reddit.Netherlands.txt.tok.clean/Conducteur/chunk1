the second one was a bridge built for a potential new road that was never built ( not as bad as the others , but it fit the comment ) . 
  the third one is a monorail that was never used , i would say that 's pretty bad . 
  however i just found out that that was actually in france ( it was just on the dutch wikipedia page for the term `` grands travaux inutiles '' ( large useless things ) which was originally used to describe large investments in belgium that did n't pay off or were never used ), 
  belgians making a bridge and when it 's built wondering what things it should [ connect ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/spookbrugvarsenare.jpg ) or [ cross ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/brug-herzele.jpg ) ~ ~ or [ what it should be used for ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/foretorleansaran2.jpg ) ~ ~ , which seems to happen [ regularly ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/tuikabelbrug_godsheide.jpg ) in [ belgium ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/viaducinutile.jpg ) , is kind of like creating a problem with a solution . 
  we have it too !, 
  i already thought we did , but i looked it up and [ this dutch wikipedia page ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/wet_op_de_collectieve_arbeidsovereenkomst ) agrees with me . 
  `` kattegat '' means `` cat 's anus '' in dutch . 
  i do n't want to know what you 're gon na close that with or why . 
  that 's worse than the wednesday story . 
  hundreds of thousands have died after they received their pensions . 
  / u/shizly posted this on / r/thenetherlands : https://i.imgur.com/pdbxnla.jpg vertical axis is cyclist fatalities / billion km , horizontal axis is % of cyclists that wear a helmet . 
  so you wear a helmet when you feel it 's ( somewhat ) likely you 'll be in an accident . 
  in the netherlands cycling is so safe that that is not considered likely . 
  i 'm proud of that , so i may have been condescending , but to me `` feeling likely to be in an accident '' and `` feeling unsafe '' are n't all that different . 
  there 's a reason all dutch people in this thread ask the helmet squad why they do n't wear helmets while showering or while walking somewhere . 
  you do n't feel unsafe there , so you do n't wear a helmet . 
  [ some guy on a ted talk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07o-tasvixy ) said that in denmark ( and keep in mind that while cycling is safe there it 's still not as safe as in the nl ) it 's actually more useful to wear a helmet as a pedestrian than as a cyclist . 
  maybe it helps that we have upright bicycles ? 
  i do n't even know how it 's possible to fall on my head from that position . 
  cycle paths here will get ice and snow removed in winter , by the way . 
  often before car roads . 
  that 's just efficiency , a cycle path has a much higher capacity than a road . 
  interesting . 
  yeah , the dutch royal family is nothing like that . 
  if you 're serious about wanting to see the responses , feel free to cross post . 
  era penal . 
  why do people wear them where you 're from ? 
  now i do n't know where you 're from , but i 'm assuming it 's because they feel unsafe on their bicycle . 
  in the netherlands people feel safe on their bicycle , which is an important reason for why it 's so popular . 
  the government wants people to cycle , so they want people to feel safe on their bicycle , so they do n't promote or mandate helmet wearing . 
  they go out of their way to make people feel safer , with [ megameters of separated cycle paths ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i6jh0/the_future_queen_of_the_netherlands_11yearold/cuduy0e ) and good traffic education for everyone on the road ( this starts in primary school ) . 
  luckily , thanks to all this ( and more ) [ head injuries due to cycling are not a major public health issue in the netherlands ] ( http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2010/08/brain-injuries-and-dutch-cyclist.html ) so it 's simply not necessary to wear a helmet . 
  it 's actually the other way around . 
  4700 km of roads with attached bicycle lanes , the rest is separate from roads , so / u/kooienb 's 30300 is correct . 
  35000 km of cycling infrastructure in total . 
  van oranje-nassau is indeed their real last name . 
  the name [ van buren ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/van_buren_%28surname%29#dutch_royal_family ) is also sometimes used because it 's common and does n't stand out ( as much ) . 
  the video was posted this morning [ on the royal family 's facebook page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/hetkoninklijkhuis/videos/vb.280838772065151/528386113977081 ) , with similarly bad quality . 
  i just downloaded it , cropped out the top and bottom , converted it to gif and uploaded it to imgur . 
  i think his majesty just has a potato for a phone . 
  usually it 's age 12 , but primary schools allow smart kids to skip a grade ( like amalia ) and kids falling behind to do the same year twice , so it will vary a little . 
  we start primary school at age 4 , so high school is typically the 9th year for us too . 
  basically the only dutch cyclists that wear helmets are the ones who cycle for sport ( at much higher speeds ) . 
  the dutch government does n't campaign for or mandate helmet wearing because it decreases subjective safety and therefore will have a negative impact on cycling rates ( which , because of safety in numbers might actually cause a decrease in objective safety too ) . 
  [ head injuries due to cycling are not a major public health issue in the netherlands ] ( http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2010/08/brain-injuries-and-dutch-cyclist.html ) . 
  this is a weak excuse . 
  mass cycling wo n't happen without good infrastructure . 
  with a network of good infrastructure cyclists will come , also in hilly cities . 
  most of the netherlands is flat , but we do have hilly areas , mostly in the south . 
  [ people ] ( http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2009/10/effect-of-hills-on-cycling.html ) still [ cycle ] ( http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2009/12/mountains-and-valleys-in-netherlands.html ) there more than anywhere outside the netherlands !, 
  that 's because we still take cyclists into account when we build stuff , everywhere and every time . 
  also [ belgium , switzerland and austria ] ( http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2008/08/pit-canaries.html ) each have decent cycling rates . 
  they 're not exactly flat countries . 
  not from a greek perspective . 
  the point / u/javelinnl is making that there is no ** separate ** cycling culture in the netherlands . 
  in many places it is a separate culture ( subculture ) , and cycling can become part of the identity of a person . 
  that is not at all the case in the netherlands . 
  everybody cycles so nobody cares that you cycle . 
  yeah . 
  i have n't read the interview but i ca n't even imagine what kind of questions there would be . 
  `` how do those broken legs you have feel ? '', 
  `` how do you feel about seeing your parents and brother being burned alive ? '', 
  `` do you want to be famous ? 
  because we 're gon na publish your name so you 'll be reminded of the crash every time people hear your name , for the rest of your life ! '', 
  in the netherlands we have de telegraaf . 
  apart from regularly publishing lies and very opinionated pieces , they are known for some other things . 
  * during world war ii the paper chose the side of the germans and published german propaganda , and articles against the resistance and jews . 
  after the war the paper could n't publish for several years because a judge ruled that the paper had committed treason . 
  * in 2010 [ a plane crashed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afriqiyah_airways_flight_771 ) leaving one survivor : a 9-year-old dutch boy . 
  de telegraaf called him up soon after the crash for an interview and published the interview with the boy 's full name . 
  this was not only in very bad taste but also considered illegal . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwwk64gbzw ), 
  it 's even a two year old post . 
  who was ever going to see that ? 
  we were neutral until those * moffen * attacked and stole our bicycles !, 
  `` do n't bring a car to a bat fight '' ? 
  well in english the regular name for the country is estonia . 
  i was afraid we used some politically incorrect name for the country ( maybe a bit like england or britain for the uk , holland for the netherlands or ivory coast for c\u00f4te d'ivoire ) . 
  is it not ? 
  in dutch this is the regular name for the country . 
  i think it 's the same in german and some scandinavian languages . 
  we have mods reposting now . 
  you ca n't survive without a bicycle . 
  also get a good lock for it if you ever want to leave it outside ( even for a short time ) . 
  learn dutch if you 're gon na stay a long time . 
  everyone speaks english but it 's difficult to make dutch friends in english . 
  even if you stay for a short time it may be useful to learn the days of the week and similar stuff to read some signs , but it 's not really necessary to learn the language . 
  [ cyclist die-in protest , amsterdam , 1979 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rbqqjad.png ) these protests were what started the netherlands getting the best cycling infrastructure in the world . 
  in recent years this type of protest has been repeated , for example in [ london ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/30/article-2516002-19b9f77700000578-896_634x425.jpg ) , [ toronto ] ( http://www.blogto.com/upload/2015/06/20150619-bikedieinatcityhall590-10.jpg ) , [ portland ] ( http://koin.com/2015/05/13/bikers-plan-die-in-at-odot/ ) and [ houston ] ( http://www.wkow.com/story/29399754/2015/06/24/bicyclists-stage-die-in-to-make-statement-on-bike-fatalities ) . 
   and may reduce vehicle traffic throughput a lot a cycle path has a much , much higher capacity ( people moved/hour ) than a road , even better if you consider that most car seats are empty so most cars waste the available capacity for them . 
  there was a big bike culture before cars almost everywhere , much bigger than now in the netherlands . 
  it dropped to very low levels in the first decades that the car was popular here too . 
  we turned it around by separating car and bicycle traffic , whereas almost everywhere else bicycling was ignored . 
  they are , it 's just that you have to make quite a detour ... through russia . 
  `` hier '' is also dutch for `` here '' and since a majority of belgians is dutch speaking and even a larger majority of belgian redditors is dutch speaking he 's probably a dutch speaking belgian . 
  the newspaper linked is more certain than op . 
  `` attentat de daesh '' in the headline means `` attack by is '' . 
  bbc still only [ suspects ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33284937 ) that it 's an islamist attack , at this time . 
  translation : `` save europe , drown a greek '' ( fmi = imf = international monetary fund ), 
  i doubt people named martin/maarten or nicholas/nikolaas are congratulated or have parties for it on those days .
