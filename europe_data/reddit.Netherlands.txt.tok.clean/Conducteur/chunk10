  4 ) i moderate / r/thenetherlands ( people love us there , source : [ askeurope ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5thpcl/what_do_you_think_of_your_countrys_subreddit/ddnaffw/?context=1 ) ) and some tiny subreddits 5 ) never been seriously banned , but there have been joke-bans ( like on / r/cirkeltrek , the dutch circlejerk ) 6 ) i 'm very active here . 
  on days that i 'm busy i check it multiple times a day , and on days that i 'm not i check it continuously ( it 's on my res / r/dashboard which i leave open most of the day ) . 
  8 ) i would love to add a rule against reposts within a certain time period ( maybe something like a month , not too long since answers change ) . 
  it can be quite frustrating to see a question you spent time carefully answering be asked again a few days later by someone who was too lazy to look if it 's been asked recently . 
  i see more and more often that people link to these previous questions , which is good imo but it also means the newer thread does n't add much anymore . 
  a. i would first remove the comment , as insults/verbal attacks are against this subreddit 's rules . 
  i would then discuss with other mods about possible further action to prevent the possibility of a conflict of interest . 
  that would depend a lot on the kind of insult and the context , but it would n't matter to whom it was said . 
  without my green hat on i 'm not a mod . 
  b. i would look at the submission carefully , especially because an opinion in a question seems out of place , but if it does n't break any rules i would leave it up . 
  c. probably still ban him for the coded language . 
  the comment history helps to determine the intention behind the comment , and this person would not get the benefit of the doubt . 
  netherlands has it too , including for mental illness . 
  it has to abide by the same rule as physical illness : only in cases of unbearable suffering with no end in sight . 
  available treatments that have n't been tried yet count as an end in sight so for mental illness it happens only in extreme cases where everything has been tried over the years . 
  i , like most dutch people , think it 's important that euthanasia is available . 
  not everyone would use it even if they did suffer enough to be allowed to , but it 's comforting that there 's a soft way out if you need it . 
  elections are usually on wednesdays , except those for the european parliament which are on thursdays so they 're closer to the elections in other countries . 
  polling stations are open from early morning until the evening though , so work is almost never a problem . 
  they 're also present on the larger train stations to accommodate commuters . 
  if you 're unable to vote on the day there are many other options to cast your vote anyway . 
  i personally like it much better than a weekend day , because it 's very convenient to vote on the way to or from uni/work . 
  our `` please no ads '' stickers on mailboxes are binding . 
  if ignored it is recommended to file a complaint . 
  companies need to give an official response to each complaint , and if there are too many they get a fine . 
  in amsterdam they 're also going to switch from an opt-out to an opt-in system this year , with a `` please give me ads '' sticker instead . 
  many other cities are also considering a system like that . 
  they already are on the forefront . 
  they were an unofficial part of [ the government before the current one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_rutte_cabinet ) . 
  they 've mostly been leading the polls for the last year and a half , and not for the first time . 
  right now they are already considered a major party and serious contender to become the biggest party , and they get all the attention that comes with that . 
  what would change in the dynamic ? 
  you 're right about that , but the dutch main elections are very different from the french or american ones . 
  we are choosing the representation in parliament , not the leader of the country . 
  wilders ' party would need to find majorities to have any real power . 
  the anti-eu-parties together do n't even come close to a majority in the polls . 
  his 26-33 seats do n't mean much if he ca n't cooperate with other parties , because that 's only 17-22 percent of the votes , which is way too small to rule alone . 
  probably . 
  that was what happened when [ queen wilhelmina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wilhelmina_of_the_netherlands ) inherited the crown at the age of 10 . 
  if that child would 've been king he ca n't have siblings ( oldest child gets the crown ) . 
  so the crown would go back up the family tree to ( 1 ) the original king 's oldest living sibling , ( 2 ) then that sibling 's children , ( 3 ) then other siblings and their children , ( 4 ) then the siblings of original king 's parents and their children and grandchildren . 
  ( it 's similar to [ this part of cgp grey 's video about the british royal family ] ( https://youtu.be/buy6hgqyweq?t=163 ) , which shows it a little bit more clearly . 
  other parts of that video differ from the dutch situation , however ), 
  article 26 of our constitution states that if the king dies while the queen is pregnant , for the purposes of determining the next monarch the unborn child is considered already born . 
  so we could theoretically have a king that 's still in the womb . 
  move to gibraltar !, 
  my voice mail message is just me asking to not leave a voice mail but instead to text , email or call back later . 
  in the netherlands it 's pretty normal too , and i doubt those few indoor slopes we have count as ski resorts . 
  most people go to austria . 
  france and germany are also popular . 
  there 's [ a lot of data ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slnl&amp;pa=37282&amp;d1=0,28,30-46,54-65,71-104,121-124,128-130&amp;d2=11-25&amp;hdr=g1&amp;stb=t&amp;vw=t ) on who goes skiing , snowboarding , etc. , including social class . 
  does n't seem like there 's much of a pattern , plenty of people from the lower classes go skiing too . 
  additionally , amsterdam is probably the most prestigious dutch city to foreigners . 
  for a while now there was a trend of an increasing amount of rich foreigners owning property , while not living there . 
  to combat that vacancy , the amsterdam council introduced [ a plan ] ( http://nltimes.nl/2016/09/29/amsterdam-fine-vacant-buildings ) that went into effect in december : the owners of buildings that are vacant for over 6 months with no good reason will be fined , and if that does n't work the city will just find tenants for the buildings without cooperation from the owner . 
  [ there are plenty of those ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_automated_urban_metro_subway_systems ) , mostly light rail lines in urban areas ( where that faster movement is important ) . 
  but rail lines and trains need to be designed for it , and both are n't something that you replace very regularly and they are very expensive to replace , so they 're not yet everywhere . 
  i did n't know him before . 
  had never seen or even heard of those tv shows . 
  this year was the first time i recognized him in home alone 2 . 
  not sicily , but scilly , you silly . 
  dutch sign language , because i 'd love to learn a sign language and that 's probably the only one that i 'd actually be able to use in the netherlands sometimes . 
  in the netherlands there are some public water fountains in cities ( usually parks ) or near touristic cycling routes , but you ca n't really count on that you 'll run into them unless you know where they are . 
  i know the local green party in my current city ( maastricht ) wanted to build a lot of them throughout the city , but i do n't think that plan made it , unfortunately . 
  they 're not really a thing inside buildings , we use faucets inside . 
  verbs ending in t or d is a really consistent set of rules , and almost every language has that sort of rules for verb endings ( and dt is n't a separate ending , it just comes from adding the t onto words consistently , even if they already have a d at the end ) . 
  the difficulty with dutch verbs for foreigners would be between strong and weak verbs ( whether they change vowels or not in the past tense ) . 
  mostly comes intuitively to native speakers , but foreigners have to study and practice to get that right . 
  the subreddit / r/hulpdiensten is dedicated to videos from the dutch ( and belgian ) emergency services . 
  a few videos in which animals are saved : * [ roe deer saved from a canal ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hulpdiensten/comments/4jpy66/brandweer_moergestel_redt_ree_uit_sluis_in/ ) * [ dog from a roof ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hulpdiensten/comments/4jf5un/brandweer_drachten_redt_hond_uit_dakgoot/ ) * [ dog from a car ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hulpdiensten/comments/4j19yn/mijnprmd_hond_uit_auto_gered/ ) * [ duckling from a manhole ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hulpdiensten/comments/4fhlmv/politie_drachten_bevrijdt_eendenkuiken_uit_een_put/ ) the animal ambulance in the hague also summarizes one of their work days every week in a youtube show `` animal ambulance on the road '' : https://www.youtube.com/user/mensendiernederland/videos . 
  it obviously also regularly includes saving animals . 
  i also remember [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/humansbeingbros/comments/41u7jf/dutch_fire_brigade_saves_a_roe_deer_fawn_that/ ) about a roe deer fawn stuck on the ice i posted on / r/humansbeingbros . 
  you might like that subreddit , though it suffers a lot from endless reposts . 
  skik is a local band from my hometown . 
  they mostly sing in dutch low saxon . 
  their song [ op fietse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1byraihts0 ) ( `` on a bicycle '' ) has some national recognition because it 's pretty catchy . 
  another bicycle-related local song i like is [ king of the world ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34fywcutqvw ) by anthony 's putsch . 
  the video that comes with it is also pretty cool .

  depends on what you mean by winning . 
  if [ the latest polls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_dutch_general_election,_2017 ) for the election in march are close to the truth his party will probably be crowned the main winner of the elections because it doubles its amount of seats in parliament and becomes one of the biggest parties . 
  right now it 's the biggest party in the polls . 
  all parties that win seats compared to the previous elections are usually called winners , though , so several of his opponents would also be winners . 
  on the other hand , wilders has very little chance of becoming prime minister . 
  he would need a coalition and the only big party that 's still a serious option for him to cooperate with is the conservative-liberal vvd . 
  together they do n't come close to the 76 seats needed for a majority , and it 's unlikely a minority coalition with wilders at the helm would be approved by a majority of the parliament . 
  there probably are n't any other parties with more than 2 seats that want to cooperate with them . 
  the christian democrats ( cda ) were in an unofficial coalition with them in 2010 , with already a lot of protest inside the party . 
  in 2012 wilders let that coalition burn to the ground , which probably means they also burned the bridge to any future coalitions with the cda . 
  most other big parties are just too different from the pvv to have much chance of a coalition . 
  i 've never heard that in emmen , drenthe . 
  maybe it 's from friends ? 
  in one episode joey uses fire as a move that supposedly beats the standard three . 
  phoebe then says her rock was actually water balloon , extinguishes joey 's fire and wins the game . 
  i think in general my local news provider rtv drenthe is quite okay . 
  unlike those of some other provinces they stick to news about drenthe , though that sometimes extends to things like the dutch national volleyball team because there 's one player from drenthe in it .
