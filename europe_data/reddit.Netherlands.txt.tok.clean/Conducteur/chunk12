  that 's the current word for europe in most countries , so i do n't think that would work . 
  fun fact : the article [ list of dutch inventions and discoveries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_dutch_inventions_and_discoveries ) is [ one of the longest on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special:longpages ) . 
  the list includes not just the cd but [ several generations of digital storage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_dutch_inventions_and_discoveries#communication_and_multimedia ) ( cassette tape , cd , dvd , blu-ray : all dutch inventions thanks to philips ), 
  we invented the traffic enforcement camera you 're welcome !, 
  i 'm not aware of a similar phenomenon here . 
  we even both have a province ^ ( nl ) / region ^ ( dk ) called zealand . 
  well i 've heard plenty of americans confuse the two for some reason , but here 's my reasoning : we 're the two biggest cycling countries in the world ( denmark still has a lot of catching up to do , but they are catching up ) . 
  i think we both have an unconventional mix of progressiveness and conservativeness . 
  both are kingdoms that extend to other continents , but with no real power for the monarchs . 
  main religion is protestantism , but religion is considered a private matter . 
  we have somewhat similar landscapes : flat with a lot of water . 
  we both like wind turbines . 
  languages are both germanic oddballs . 
  there are also differences , but i think it 's the * most * similar country like you asked . 
  belgium was the first country i thought of because ~ 60 % of them speak the same language , but i see a lot more differences . 
  my answer may be biased though : i come from the northeast of the netherlands , the part that 's farthest from belgium and closest to denmark . 
  denmark , i think, 
  it 's nowhere near as common as it used to be , so you may have some difficulty finding a lift ( especially as a lone guy , being or bringing a girl helps , car drivers are a bunch of sexist pigs ) but it 's still done sometimes and very doable and safe if you 're smart about it . 
  stand near gas stations , parking lots or the city provided lifting spots , or at least on a place where it 's safe to be and traffic can easily see you and safely stop . 
  near gas stations or parking lots you could even just ask people . 
  a common hitchhikers ' mistake : walking on motorways is illegal and very dangerous . 
  if the police catches you before you 're run over you get a fine ( which are not insignificant here ) and getting caught is quite likely as many drivers call the police for this . 
  if there 's no other way , walk in the grass behind the guardrails . 
  you may be interested in blablacar by the way , basically hitchhiking with a reservation ( for a small fee ) . 
  or just public transportation , of course , like most people . 
  it 's excellent over here . 
  so errr , broke or plastic-only payer ? 
  well , outside of your wallet is okay too . 
  even people outside eurozone countries must have those left over from travels or something , right ? 
  i just noticed i have n't got a single dutch one right now . 
   the princess of denmark is from australia and met the prince while he was in australia and it was n't until a year later when he told her who he was sounds a lot like the movie [ the prince and me ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_prince_and_me ) . 
  i live alone in a studio apartment in maastricht and pay around $ 400 per month . 
  that price is below average for the city , i know people who pay more for their room in a shared apartment , but i have a longer than average commute to the city center . 
  it 's still only a 10 minute bike ride , so i do n't mind , but it makes a significant difference in price . 
  i regularly see people think it was 9 september or 9 november because of the 9/11 thing . 
  even in this thread tonygaze made that mistake :  9th of september ' 01 . 
  why even have a separate weather presenter if he/she is n't some kind of expert on weather ? 
  * 3 bicycles : one at home ( used almost daily ) , one in each of my parents ' cities ( used whenever i 'm there ) * an electric bicycle , used several times a month for the longer recreational cycling tours . 
  also it 's sometimes used for errands if i 'm feeling particularly lazy . 
  * a kayak , gets used a few times a year * a pair of ice skates , gets used a few times per decade ( we do n't get much natural ice in the winters anymore ), 
  par contre = on the other hand n'oublie pas = do n't forget les espaces = the spaces avant = before les ponctuations doubles = the `` double punctuation marks '' ( with two parts ( !, 
  ) , they get an extra space in french ) futur citoyen !, 
  = future citizen !, 
  really ? 
  i 've never heard that, 
  we say * gezondheid * , dutch for * health * and with obvious similarities to the german word * gesundheit * . 
  it 's quite big in the netherlands . 
  it used to be called `` msn-language '' , but now that msn messenger does n't exist anymore that term has fallen out of use a bit . 
  a lot of english acronoyms are also part of it , but many are dutch . 
  famous ones that even dutch grandmothers know , but are now too tacky to use if you 're over the age of 14 : * * hoest * , literal translation `` howst '' , meaning `` how is it [ going ] ? '', 
  * * ff w88 * = wait a minute * * lama * = never mind ones that people of all ages still use : * * ajb * = please * * gvd * = god damn it * * iig * = anyway/definitely * * idd * = indeed * * mss * = maybe * * wrs * = probably, 
  quad and jetski or waterscooter we use a lot of english loanwords . 
  about 1/5 -1 / 6 of the netherlands is reclaimed land . 
  only a few city states beat us proportionally . 
  in total amount i think the over 7000 km \u00b2 easily beat every other country . 
  if you want to be even more original , go for an underpass under a river ( aquaduct ) something like [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/chqdk1o.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4e/19/05/4e190588120b4d7437e6a7b2da620574.jpg ) , perhaps ? 
  it 's barely celebrated here , and it 's seen as something american . 
  there are some halloween themed parties , that 's about it in my experience . 
  trick-or-treating is n't done , probably because there 's saint martin 's day ( 11 november ) which in the netherlands is mainly celebrated by trick-or-treating , and it would just be too much twice in two weeks . 
  nah , it wo n't bother us . 
  but we might just turn it into a large polder as `` lebensraum '' . 
  i think our border with the north sea is most likely to change . 
  that was abolished , [ females are now also registered ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2016/02/84423-2/ ) , but i ca n't really answer on how it used to work . 
  i believe laws can ignore this article of the constitution in certain circumstances , but what circumstances those are , why they exist or what the fuck the point of the constitution is in that case i do n't know . 
  the equality principle :  all persons in the netherlands are treated equally in equal circumstances . 
  discrimination on the grounds of religion , belief , political opinion , race , sex or on any other grounds whatsoever is not permitted . 
  you ruined an otherwise excellent comment with your nagging about hypothetical downvotes . 
  $ 40/month for fiber-to-the-home internet ( 500 mbps up/down , unlimited ) , interactive tv and phone connection, 
  i agree . 
  i 'll add formula 1 which had live coverage for years and has only gotten more popular now that we have our own driver who 's doing well . 
  swimming and darts tournaments are also often broadcast live , so they must be reasonably popular . 
  common enough that the dutch government has [ an organization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dares ) set up so they can be used in emergency situations if necessary , like restoring communications with large flooded areas . 
  i like the parisian group sexion d'assaut with hits like [ ma direction ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7-vp7tnluy ) , [ d\u00e9sol\u00e9 ] ( https://youtu.be/nlabywkwrfk?t=31 ) and [ avant qu'elle parte ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln2oztznjc0 ) from the netherlands i think without understanding dutch de jeugd van tegenwoordig is still interesting with [ sterrenstof ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnmxskfwflq ) and [ watskeburt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjer3ex948w ) . 
  i also quite like the partysquad with songs like [ stuk ] ( https://youtu.be/-wgm7if4gzg?t=96 ) or [ ik ga hard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvocb-dnwj8 ) . 
  [ this reddit thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/42c18z/german_here_please_teach_me_something_about_dutch/ ) in / r/thenetherlands has many more ( better ) recommendations . 
  honorary mention for the german group 257ers which made a satirical song about `` the greatest city in the world '' : [ holland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drfsxlchrwc ) . 
  netherlands because independence : do n't need your parents to drive you around , just get on your bicycle . 
  the custom that when someone offers you something ( like a present or dinner invite ) you should always refuse to be polite , so they can offer it again and you can refuse it again until you both insist . 
  how would you tell the difference between someone honestly refusing and someone being interested but too polite to say so ? 
  and why drag a simple thing out for so long ? 
  at least a custom in spain , but possibly elsewhere too . 
  in the netherlands it 's customary to offer once and answer truthfully . 
  we do have many of them , we just call them [ student societies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/student_society ) and do n't segregate based on gender . 
  if you want high speed , selecting the maxspeeds option on [openrailwaymap.org ] ( http://www.openrailwaymap.org/ ) may be a more reliable map . 
  it also gives way more normal speed rail lines . 
  for some countries most lines are missing on your map ( e.g. 
  for the netherlands it only shows the three major international lines , but it skipped the dozens of national lines and minor international lines ) your premise about eastern europe barely having high-speed rail seems to be correct , however . 
  to be fair , even dutch people have difficulty deciphering that . 
  i do n't understand every word , though i get the gist . 
  i remember going to an atm just after midnight the night of the introduction of the euro hoping to get my hands on some of the new banknotes , but there were still guilders in there . 
  and even in the netherlands [ it almost never rains ] ( http://www.hetregentbijnanooit.nl/site/it-almost-never-rains-in-english/ ), 
  i like watching hockey . 
  it 's like a fast-paced version of football with a proper video referee . 
  and the netherlands has a real chance to get a medal . 
  the earthing is different in some countries . 
  we have it on the top and bottom of the socket ( type f ) , at least france ( and maybe other countries he visits , type e ) has a pin in the socket above the middle of the two holes . 
  i believe italy has yet another type . 
  not every plug can accommodate all these sockets . 
  so getting a europlug ( without earthing , common for phones anyway ) is the best option . 
  cheapest is to get one or more big suitcases and take a plane or the train , especially if you reserve the ticket ( s ) well in advance .
