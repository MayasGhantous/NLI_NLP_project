  plane would be faster in this case , but trains usually do n't have limits on weight or amount as long as you can carry it yourself . 
  driving it yourself is also possible , but someone would have to bring the car back ( or if it 's a rental car you pay a lot of money for the one-way-fee ) and with all the tolls and fuel it 's probably much more expensive .

  my passport was checked on the train from germany to czechia recently . 
  that last thing we do here too , every 11 november , though with all kinds of candy . 
  it 's traditional to sing songs to get the candy . 
  czechia gets credit for inventing for inventing the most popular beer type at least : according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pilsner ) more than 2/3 of beers produced in the world are pilsners , named after pilsen , czechia . 
  seems you 're right . 
  i remembered hearing something about it and just now googled and picked the first link . 
  but it 's the only source i can find that says it , and it 's would be major news otherwise , so i think you 're probably right . 
  the only thing i can find is accusations of violations of human rights , but that 's very different and almost every country probably gets those sometimes . 
  in 2016 : * theresa may , the now prime minister of the uk , [ proposed plans to leave the human rights convention ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/25/uk-must-leave-european-convention-on-human-rights-theresa-may-eu-referendum ) ( [ though later ditched them to become pm ] ( http://rightsinfo.org/breaking-theresa-may-will-not-try-leave-european-convention-human-rights/ ) ) * ~ ~ [ france withdrew from the human rights charter ] ( https://intlinterest.com/2016/04/06/frances-war-human-rights/ ) ~ ~ edit : seems false * [ turkey suspended the human rights convention ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-to-suspend-european-convention-on-human-rights-coup-recep-tayyip-erdogan-state-emergency/ ) * and extremists in general gaining popularity in many places in europe i must say i agree that it 's not as impossible as i once thought it was . 
  our main rival , especially in football , is germany . 
  outside of football we also jokingly talk about germans having stolen our bicycles . 
  this relates to ww2 when bicycles were taken by nazis and the metals turned into weaponry . 
  while there was some real animosity after the war , it has now turned into a joke . 
  furthermore , we have a slight rivalry with belgium . 
  we joke about them being stupid and their dialect of dutch unintelligible . 
  jokes about annexations to save them from themselves are made regularly . 
  then there 's finland , with whom we have a one-sided rivalry . 
  some comedians have a now famous sketch glorifying how high the netherlands is in many world stats ( e.g. 
  highest freight bicycle density ) , but in the stats that matter ( happiness , education , etc. ), 
  we 're often the number 2 with finland as number 1 . 
  that has continued on the internet so we 're now very happy any time we 're above finland and very sad when they cheated and end up above us . 
  lastly / r/thenetherlands has a mostly one-sided rivalry with / r/sweden about the number of subscribers . 
  the swedes have more now , but they started way before us and we 're catching up !, 
  do people actually play those ? 
  basically every popular tv series , movie or televised event has a drinking game like that , but i 've never heard of people actually playing them . 
  i thought it was just something for / r/funny to point out things that happen often or something . 
  [ beer pong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beer_pong ) , [ kings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kings_\\ ( game \\ ) ) , [ bus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ride_the_bus ) and [ three man ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_man ) are the most popular in my experience . 
  i personally like kings most . 
  i 've never lived there , but from what i understand there is n't anyone monolingual in frisian . 
  outside the cities many people speak frisian in daily life , but everyone is able to speak dutch . 
  in the cities the daily language is dutch . 
  dutch is a mandatory subject in every dutch high school and it has been for a long time so there really is n't any way around learning to speak it even for someone who was raised monolingually . 
  making the case for the netherlands :  language barriers you 'll want to learn dutch in the long term , it does make getting a job and getting locals as friends easier . 
  but considering the high level of english of practically everyone on the short term there 's a very low barrier in the netherlands . 
  in it especially , it 'll be quite easy to get an it job even without speaking a word of dutch . 
  dutch is also one of the easiest languages to learn from english . 
   travel accessibility excellent public transportation here , everything is connected at high frequencies and at affordable ( though not cheap ) prices , especially intra-country travel . 
  connections to other countries are less frequent and the high speed trains use variable pricing , but still very useful . 
  excellent infrastructure for other transport modes too , for everything from bicycles to airplanes and from cars to boats . 
   where is nice to live and visit this entirely depends on your taste . 
  if you want a mountain cabin away from everyone the netherlands ca n't help you , but we do have small villages where everyone knows eachother and large anonymous metropolitan areas and everything in between . 
  even though amsterdam is n't a huge city it still has many of the qualities of a huge city because of its proximity to other cities . 
  culture shock should be very manageable . 
  the netherlands is n't always very credit card friendly since they 're rare here with our strong preference for debit cards , so your experience here may be different from it elsewhere . 
  however , dutch train ticket vending machines do accept credit cards so if it did n't even work there that 's not a good sign for you : you may be right about it being unusable in other countries . 
  richest third-world country, 
  tastes of beer/wine/jenever around 9-10 , my first whole beer was at 14 at a party , and first time drunk at 17 . 
  relevant : [ a recent traffic jam in the netherlands ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7cx5wuv.jpg ), 
  it 's basically hitchhiking with a reservation ( and with payment ) , so you have to be a little flexible with dates and departure + arrival location , but they offer drivers the possibility to say whether they 're okay with animals . 
  most rides appear a few days to a week before the travel date . 
  in czechia \u010dau ( pronounced the same ) can be used for both hello and goodbye . 
  tschau in switzerland too , probably italian influence . 
  `` fuck off and tell the yanks '' i 'm assuming, 
  denmark was the first with registered partnerships ( * registreret partnerskab * ) for same-sex couples in 1989 , so you get credit there , but it was apparently still different from marriage for opposite-sex couples until it was all replaced my gender-neutral marriage in 2012 . 
  if it was n't called marriage and was different from marriage , i 'm not defining it as marriage . 
  it 's uncommon . 
  the elections for the provincial government and for the [ water boards ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_board_\\ ( netherlands \\ ) ) were combined last time , in march 2015 . 
  this was mostly done as an attempt to increase voter turnout for the water boards election . 
  it was quite succesful ( 43.5 % instead of the 22.7 % in 2008 ) , and might therefore be repeated in 2019 . 
  however , there are loud voices in the netherlands to just abolish the whole water board government level or to elect them indirectly , because nobody follows water board politics and it has very little impact on daily life , and people argue that combining elections skews results , so it might have been the last combined election for a while . 
  marriage : yes , since 2001 . 
  we were the first country in the world to allow this in modern times . 
  adopt : yes , also since 2001 . 
  according to wikipedia we were the first * country * with this too , but the spanish region navarra allowed it 9 months before us . 
  it should be noted that some foreign countries make it more difficult for them to adopt children , but there are no limits on the dutch side . 
  serve in the army : yes , since 1973 . 
  perception : most people have no problem with it , but there is some friction every now and then . 
  the smallest religious political parties ( 2 christian and 1 muslim ) still vote against anti-lgbt-discrimination laws if it ever comes up , but they have no real power on their own . 
  the main christian party ( christian-democrats ) and all nonreligious parties usually vote in favour . 
  every now and then there is an act of violence against lgbt people , which is mostly attributed to low education . 
  there have been openly gay people making it far in all kinds of professions : the army , politics , entertainment , sports , etc. 
  just ignore him . 
  euthanasia for mental problems is not illegal in the netherlands , though it 's quite rare with only a handful of cases a year . 
  the requirement of `` unbearable suffering with no end in sight '' is also valid for mental suffering . 
  for mental problems the `` no end in sight '' means years of therapy and all different types of medication must have been tried without success . 
  we even honour dutch emergency services with their own subreddit : / r/hulpdiensten at least we honour the ones who upload videos about their work from their dashcams and/or bodycams . 
  chapter 1 article 1 of the dutch constitution :  everyone in the netherlands will be treated equally in equal cases . 
  discrimination based on religion , beliefs , political disposition , race , sex , or any other ground , is not permitted . 
  fyi : you can bring empty bottles through security and fill them up with tap water afterwards . 
  you can bring the filled up bottle on the plane too ( or at least i never got in trouble for it ), 
  not necessary , that 's instinct for dutch people . 
  maybe this is even true within the uk ... i would say the scottish are more nationalistic than the english , and [ they 're much more pro-eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum#sub-national_polling ) . 
  but it could be that i 'm underestimating english nationalism here . 
  this is exactly how it is in the netherlands , except that the self-driving part can also be done with gps instead of road signs . 
  you 're supposed to practice both , the examiner decides what you get on the exam ( just like with the manoeuvre ) . 
  and that 's not even mentioning the population living in the large cities which do have decent enough alternatives that a car is no longer necessary . 
  who would want a car in nyc ? 
  actually the latest official estimate ( end of 2015 ) says there are 22.7 million bicycles in the netherlands : [ source ] ( http://www.nu.nl/werk-en-prive/4243183/nederland-telt-227-miljoen-fietsen.html ) ( in dutch , but also with a bar graph comparing it to previous years ), 
  you do n't even have to go to amsterdam . 
  most other larger dutch cities have window prostitution too , though of course these red light districts are much smaller than amsterdam 's . 
   i 'd say it 's similar to soldiers you 're speaking to an american . 
  do german prostitutes get everything for free with people coming up to them all the time to thank them for their service ? 
  i was n't arguing against it . 
  i was just curious . 
  if they do n't have their own football associations that 's a pretty clear reason why they do n't participate separately ( though of course they could simply split up the german association should they ever want to join the euros with multiple teams ), 
  do they have their own football associations ? 
  it does n't decide everything though .
