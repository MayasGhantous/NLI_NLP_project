  i think most dutch people feel like `` why not ? 
  health insurance is mandatory for everyone , so it 's logically the most common . 
  vehicle insurance is mandatory for every motor vehicle , at least the liability part . 
  homeowners insurance is n't legally mandatory , but most/all banks require it as part of a mortgage when you buy a house . 
  then a lot of people have contents insurance , personal liability insurance and travel insurance . 
  life insurance and legal expenses insurance are also quite common . 
  apparently [ dutch people like insurance ] ( http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2014/04/09/no-57-insurance-policies/ ) edit : i myself just have health insurance ( free ) and travel insurance , but i 'm a student so i do n't own much stuff . 
  however , my father for example has every single one of these insurances . 
  hares and frogs are common , as are plenty of fish , birds and butterflies . 
  do n't think i 've ever seen a wild owl here , though . 
  swans , tits , chaffinch , sparrows , robins and crows are the most common birds around , i think . 
  in the right season you 'll see these animals weekly , if not daily . 
  you 'll see hedgehogs , squirrels , moles and martens every now and then too , but i think they try to avoid humans more . 
  we have some roe deer , foxes and wild boars too , but you would n't really stumble upon them . 
  you 'd have to go looking for them in the woods . 
  ( answering for drenthe , one of the most rural areas in the netherlands , though it 's probably still suburban by foreign standards ), 
  it 's not the license itself that 's expensive , it 's learning to drive and proving that you can . 
  driving lessons by professionals and a proper examination cost money . 
  without that it 's no wonder that us licenses are cheap , but it 's also no wonder the us has terrible traffic safety . 
  i will decide on my own that nobody in the dorm can hang out with ukraine . 
  i 'll wake everyone up just walking through the hall with my clogs .

  though he 's not `` currently journeying '' as he 's already arrived , / u/teh _ fizz is a syrian refugee in the netherlands and has done two amas . 
  maybe it helps .

  due to recent events there are border checks even within the schengen area . 
  not every car is checked thoroughly , but there 's a lower speed limit near the border so the police can see which cars need the thorough check . 
  [ a little bit of it is on video ] ( https://youtu.be/pyvkjj5_waa?t=15 ), 
  definitely flights from amsterdam to vienna , even on thursday evening ( with klm ) . 
  vienna is very close to bratislava , should be easy to move there . 
  are those flights full or something ? 
  i also see train connections that leave from schiphol/amsterdam on thursday after 17:00 and arrive in bratislava before friday 17:00 . 
  i used bahn.de . 
  it might give you some risky transfers ( 8 minutes transfer time for something this important on such a long journey is not enough imo ) , so i recommend clicking on `` further search options '' and selecting a higher minimum transfer duration . 
  it 's a long ride ( at least 15 hours ) , but if there 's no other option ... 
  well you 'd still have the one-way-fee when driving from the netherlands to france . 
  it will probably be a lower one-way-fee , but still . 
  there are also ferries available to the uk , even from the netherlands . 
  if you can be picked up in the uk that might be a better option . 
  one-way-fee within the same country is definitely cheaper or even absent . 
  rental cars are very expensive with the one-way-fee , but any other method of moving that stuff from nl to uk is probably going to be very expensive too so that might not matter too much . 
  it could be cheaper to rent the car , use it to move your stuff and after a few days you use it for a roadtrip to amsterdam and then take the train back again . 
  of course it 'd be a little bit of a waste of time and a trip to amsterdam is probably not the first thing on your to-do list after a move like that , but it has the added advantage of having a car available the first few days after moving . 
  anyway , make sure you get a rental car that 's allowed to get out of continental europe . 
  not every rental car is . 
  also make sure dogs are allowed . 
  i think most rental car companies allow it , provided you return the car in a clean state , but keep it in mind . 
  with chip and pin you can just go to any atm . 
  they 're almost always free , but if you 're homesick and really want the fees you can use those atms that are not built into a wall . 
  i agree with the others that you 're unlikely to be pickpocketed and if it happens that you 're unlikely to catch them , but if it happens citizen 's arrest is probably the answer to what you want . 
  do n't use more violence than needed , and call for police immediately ( if there 's no officer near you : call 112 ) . 
  most charming : belgium ugliest : belgium, 
  almost every hostel and hotel has wifi nowadays , so you 'd only use it `` on the go '' . 
  and you 're right , a lot of caf\u00e9s , coffee shops , restaurants , etc. 
  offer wifi , and so do some cities themselves ( mostly in places like parks and shopping streets ) . 
  if you 're a student , your university probably has eduroam . 
  it also exists in europe and it 's a great wifi network from almost every building that has anything to do with a university . 
  there are plenty of apps that offer offline maps , so you would n't really need it for that . 
  i do n't know how much of an internet addict you are on vacation , but it 's probably not necessary to get mobile internet . 
  it can even be very relaxing to not get every notification right away and enjoy the view instead . 
  i also often hear that kerosine is relatively very cheap . 
  i 've heard the term `` subsidized '' but i think they just mean that it 's not taxed while for example petrol is . 
  airports , however , are often subsidized . 
  possibly way more than rail tracks are subsidized . 
  `` excuse me sir , you seem to have lost something . '', 
  `` oh , thank you , what is it ?

  we need to get rid of the king 's head and replace it with a bicycle . 
  on the dutch euro coins , i mean . 
  the netherlands does not not , provided the man is the biological father . 
  same for the mother by the way , no opt-out if biological mother . 
  the only exception is third-party reproduction ( sperm/egg donation ) . 
  some reddit threads have made me believe that that exception does n't exist in ( parts of ) the us , though i 'm sure information from reddit threads should be taken with a grain of salt . 
  [ there are many ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_low-cost_airlines#europe ) , and i do n't know where exactly they all fly so i 'd recommend using a flight search engine like google flights or kayak . 
  money margins on the food are generally much smaller than margins on drinks . 
  if everyone would get free tap water many people wourd order fewer drinks or even none at all and the restaurant would n't earn as much money . 
  people here do n't always like it either . 
  [ here 's a map of restaurants in the netherlands serving tap water ] ( https://www.krnwtr.nl/in-de-horeca/de-kraanwaterkaart/ ) , though it 's not necessarily free . 
  sometimes they require you to order another drink or they charge a small amount of money for it . 
  there are high speed trains to barcelona from both paris and lyon and it should be easy to find out how to get to one of those cities from strasbourg . 
  both cities are worth visiting . 
  transfering in paris might require taking the metro , which is not necessary in lyon . 
  to get the cheapest tickets for high speed trains : book early and/or be flexible with the travel time/date . 
  tickets become available about three months in advance . 
  you could also look into budget airlines . 
  both barcelona and london are popular destinations , so with a little bit of luck they 're cheaper . 
  however , take into account that those airlines often charge a lot for checking any luggage and that you still need to travel to and from the airports . 
  i would include iceland and the northern half of fennoscandia and just name it all conductorland or something . 
  well the coalition is trying to help syria sort out its problems so it 's a more attractive place to live . 
  it 's just that the primary problem is daesh . 
  once they 're gone i 'm sure they 'll continue helping with rebuilding the country , teaching the police force , etc. 
  like in other places . 
  you can disagree with the way they 're doing it , but you propose no alternative way to sort out the problems so it 's difficult to take you seriously . 
  do you think we 're bombing the place for fun ? 
  ever heard of daesh/is/isil / isis ? 
  nothing about cheese , bicycles or weed ? 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  what you said is mostly true though . 
  the belgians are stupid , dumb and have a low iq . 
  the flemish are incomprehensible , even though we speak the same language .
