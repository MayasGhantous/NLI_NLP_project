  they 'll just look at you awkwardly or ask if you want a piece of `` cake '' with it . 
  i took the main cinema here in town and only films that were shown in the last 7 days ( according to their website ) , counting different versions ( 2d/3d/subbed / dubbed ) all as one . 
  country | # | % | : -- | : -- | : -- | united states | 21 | 60 % | netherlands | 9 | 26 % | belgium | 2 | 6 % | united kingdom | 1 | 3 % | guatemala | 1 | 3 % | spain | 1 | 3 % | edit : / u/non-rhetorical , now i 'm curious about your own local cinema . 
  i 'm guessing a typical us cinema ( not the artsy/documentary types ) would show over 90 % us films , but that 's nothing more than a guess . 
  one of the nordics or switzerland . 
  if i had to pick one , probably norway . 
  i had to show my passport while crossing a schengen border . 
  my life will never be the same again after this horrific experience . 
  for most people it 's a whole lot of effort , because a lot of stuff has to be arranged and the language barrier and differences in laws make it difficult to do . 
  you notice europe is definitely not one country , even without border controls within schengen . 
  you suddenly need a new health insurance , your pensions get fucked up , taxes get much more difficult ( and you get to fill everything in twice a year now ! ) . 
  not to mention that the cultures can differ significantly , which requires getting used to . 
  it definitely happens , but most people do n't bother . 
  for students , however , it 's very common and financially encouraged with the erasmus scholarship . 
  there 's less of an effort , because the language barrier is less of a problem ( everyone you meet speaks english ) and there 's a lot less to worry about ( just do n't officially register in the foreign country to prevent the whole bureaucratic mess ) . 
  multiple flairs is n't really supported by reddit , go to / r/ideasfortheadmins . 
  text is , of course , but the regular text is very useful for mobile app users ( who do n't see the flag , just the text ) just use the european flag if you do n't want to choose one country and remember to specify the country/ies you talk about when answering questions . 
  or use the french flag if you mostly answer about france , which makes sense if you 've lived there all/most of your life . 
  probably . 
  turns out in dutch we only have one `` william of orange '' and the others have numbers : `` william . . of orange '' . 
  but it says ( in dutch ) [ here ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/willem_van_oranje_%28doorverwijspagina%29 ) :  when the british speak of william of orange they mean this william [ iii of orange ] . 
  now that you 've added a british flair it all makes sense , and we now know we were both right . 
  i think he means the equivalent of `` hero '' in dutch is held at a bit higher regard . 
  not many people would consider everyone they hold in high regard as heroes . 
  but we do have a list of national heroes [ on the dutch language wikipedia ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksheld#nederlandse_helden ) . 
  it 's not on the english wikipedia ( yet ) , but by clicking on the name and then clicking on `` english '' in the left sidebar even those who do n't speak dutch should be able to figure out what they 've done . 
  the only one that you named that 's on this list is william of orange . 
  wait ... there is more than one william of orange ? 
  i really suck at history . 
  our national anthem is sung as if we are him ( in the first person , from his perspective ) , he 's the main reason orange is the national colour of the netherlands and his personal motto became the national motto ( `` je maintiendrai '' / i will maintain ) even though it 's in french . 
  i think as a country we do glorify him a bit . 
  i do get offended when fox news or even a us presidential candidate says that [ we 're massively killing off our elderly involuntarily as budget cuts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v4u0doax3y ) or that [ amsterdam is a mess full of organized crime and drug addicts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpsfisxm3w ) , but that 's not really stereotyping and more just the ignorant conservative americans blabbing nonsense . 
  more common stereotypes do n't really offend me . 
  i mean , we do n't all smoke pot all day either , but that stereotype is still funny and not infuriating . 
  * i think you 're right about the `` well , our taxes are higher , but that 's ok because we get a lot more out of it '' mentality in general . 
  there are always people who feel like they pay too much , but i 'd say in general people do n't really care . 
  not really different from the us , in my experience . 
  there are even some people who say jokingly that they are honoured about paying ( a lot of ) taxes since it means that you 're supporting your country ( and that you have a high enough salary to pay a lot of taxes ) . 
  * we have a system like you describe . 
  [ wikipedia 's graph ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/dutch_education_system-en.svg ) describes it perfectly . 
  wo = scientific education = university , but as you can see there are other forms of tertiary education ( also equivalent to college , or community college ) . 
  [ see the article for more details ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_the_netherlands ) . 
  however , i do n't think it 's to manage costs . 
  i think it 's mostly to make the most use of one 's intelligence . 
  if even tertiary education is the same level for everyone , the smartest people will only get lazy and bored while the least smart people might not be able to keep up . 
  * this is more and more a problem , now the baby boom generation is getting old ( so relatively few working people per old person ) , but i think we 're still managing . 
  they 're now trying to decrease prices for medication by buying it together with other countries so we do n't get screwed over as much for being a small country that buys relatively low amounts . 
  another thing that 's different from many countries is that it 's pretty much impossible to see a specialist without seeing a gp first . 
  the gp works as a filter , so 95 % of cases are never referred to the ( more expensive ) specialists in hospitals . 
  since your main question has been answered for the netherlands , i 'll answer your other one . 
  ibiza is incredibly popular for the nightlife , but if money is tight it 's not a destination for you . 
  clubs have huge entrance fees ( i 've heard up to $ 80 ) and you probably wo n't find drinks in a club for less than $ 10 . 
  in other words : the us ca n't be saved . 
  but ... but ... then there would n't be any western developing countries left . 
  who would we make fun of ? 
  i have n't had any trouble yet , so no . 
  but there have been people who did . 
  there even was a case where some woman actually gave the security codes from that card reader to a scammer over the phone and she was still reimbursed the thousands that were stolen from her . 
  there are different security options . 
  i have enabled that for a payment under $ 25 or $ 50 that day it just requires the separate passwords . 
  for anything above that i need one of those card readers ( which in turn requires card + pin ) . 
  also , the bank will reimburse any fraudulent payments as a guarantee it 's safe on their end , just like is the norm for other types of payments . 
   also a simple practical problem is how do i pay normal people ? 
  a business has card readers and such but should i and everyone else buy one too ? 
  even for small amounts of money ? 
  at least here in the netherlands it 's as easy as opening your bank 's smartphone app , logging in with an extra security code , wiring the money and confirming with yet another security code . 
  takes less than a minute . 
  takes only about 15 seconds if you do it often and the receiver is in your saved account numbers already . 
  in the future maybe you could do something with holding your phones together , filling in the details and confirming with a code or thumbprint or something . 
  most of the other things you name are also already possible to pay with cards and common practice in the netherlands . 
   when you 're buying the paper from the homeless street vendors who unlike the ones in sweden ( according to the ny times article ) have n't started ccarrying around card readers . 
  they 've started in amsterdam 2 years ago ( [ dutch source ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2004713-pinnen-bij-de-straatkrantverkoper.html ) ) , but it might not be very widespread yet . 
   cheques do n't exist anymore in europe they still exist in france . 
  only old people use them though . 
  with 300 million patients they must be overworked themselves . 
  it 's the least first-world first-world-country . 
  there are no taxes or fees for moving goods across eu borders . 
  it 'd probably take a few days to arrive , but it depends on what shipping company you use . 
  even easier would be for him to pay you the money so you can buy the phones yourselves , or for him to order them online and having them shipped directly to you . 
  there may even be a difference in price depending on the country you order it in ( it could be less expensive in bosnia ) . 
  the games that start at 1 pm ny time are still okay . 
  that 's 7 pm here . 
  but it 's never broadcast on tv either , afaik . 
  internet is my only option . 
  i kinda like it . 
  i try to watch the super bowl every year , but it 's difficult with the game usually starting in the middle of the night on a monday morning . 
  i used to sometimes watch other games ( the ny giants ones which started on a watchable hour ) when nfl game passes were still free for europeans , but they stopped this a few years ago , maybe because of americans using vpns . 
  the salute itself is not illegal in the netherlands . 
  however , because it 's generally associated with antisemitism it may in some cases be prosecuted as inciting hatred , especially when combined with other antisemitic stuff ( fighting words ) . 
  according to wikipedia it 's illegal in germany , austria and czechia . 
  is it mandatory anywhere ? 
  hakas are cool , the flag is confusing , it 's very far away ( it 's the antipode of parts of europe ) and i hear it 's a beautiful country . 
  do n't know much else about it to be honest . 
  i 've never been there . 
  apart from milan itself ( obviously ) , turin ( torino ) is closer than most of the cities you named and it 's a beautiful old city with plenty of churches , cathedrals and castles . 
  i do n't know why it was n't on your list , but do n't underestimate it . 
  florence is quite far away , but well accessible with public transportation ( not so much with a car ) , and has very many churches . 
  venice is definitely worth a visit ( especially outside the high season ) . 
  beautiful , very unique . 
  i have n't been there myself , but i heard from multiple people that pisa is n't all that interesting .
