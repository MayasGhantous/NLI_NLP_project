  i know in the netherlands you get a maestro debit card with it and i 've heard it 's the same in several other countries . 
  in my experience these debit cards work practically all over the world ( especially europe ) , but i 've heard that some people have a different experience . 
  still , it will work in most places . 
  it 's not easy ( if possible at all ) to get a bank account in a country in which you 're not legally living , however . 
  i would recommend against moscow if you do n't have a lot of time and want to travel cheaply . 
  moscow is n't in the eu and it 's pretty isolated . 
  it 's 1150 km ( ~ 715 mi , about the distance nyc - chicago , il ) from warsaw , poland ( and even farther away from the more touristy places of poland ) . 
  you will therefore need a separate visa to enter russia and you will have to travel from moscow to your desired destinations . 
  this will probably be another plane if you only have 19 days . 
  if you add the costs of the visa and the extra travel i doubt it 's cheaper . 
  i think you can take a look at [ kayak explore ] ( http://www.kayak.com/explore/ ) ( just select your departure airport ) and [ google flights ] ( https://www.google.com/flights/ ) ( select up to five airports on both departure and arrival ) to find cheaper flights to multiple destinations . 
  you start looking a bit late and you 're traveling in the high season , but if you 're flexible i think there are still affordable flights out there . 
  nyc-london is one of the most flown ( international ) routes in the world . 
  do n't just look for direct flights . 
  iceland air for example can have very affordable flights from north america to europe , but always with a layover in reykjavik . 
   i really do n't want to go too much farther east than russia i strongly advise against going to alaska to travel to europe . 
  if after 2 days or so they still have n't answered you can try pm ` ing them again . 
  i imagine they 're busy and sometimes forget to answer some of them . 
  of course we here ca n't know the details of then ban . 
  it 's / r/askeurope not / r/ask/r / europe . 
  you can [ send a pm to / r/europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/europe ) and it ends up in the mods ' collective mailbox ( modmail ) . 
  if the violation was n't severe and you 've not been warned for it before ( both unlikely as you 'd probably know what the reason for the ban was then ) and you send a polite pm , you have a real chance of getting unbanned . 
  `` ich m\u00f6chte eine medizin gegen fu\u00dfpilz , bitte '' approximate pronunciation ( from english ) : eeg mug-tuh i-nuh may-dee-tseen gay-gun foos-peeltz , beet-uh translation : i would like ( a ) medicine/drug against athlete 's foot , please but as has been said , most of these people will probably speak english . 
  about $ 0.50 dutch lunches are pretty boring compared to lunches in most other countries though . 
  what about a pilgrimage ? 
  i 'm not aware of any places requiring women to wear high heels . 
  first , i have some sources for that statement . 
  1 : [ blog with comparison between western world ] ( http://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/08/20/americas-progress-on-street-safety-is-pathetic/ ) and 2 : [ table comparing data between usa , uk , sweden and the netherlands ] ( http://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/legacy/2013/02/06/safety-table.jpg ) . 
  now , why traffic there is so unsafe is of course very complicated . 
  the main reason i think is that the us is very car-centric , which : * makes them drive more ( but the us is still one of the least safe countries of the western world if corrected for how much they drive as seen in the second source ) * means there 's less willingness to have lower speed limits on local roads , higher speeds = many more fatalities in case of collision * means alternatives do n't get as much money as they should , so pedestrians and bicyclists often have abysmal infrastructure or no infrastructure at all and share the road with cars ( [ which is very dangerous at high speeds ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vq2eb0j.jpg ) ) and of course this only combine that with the almost-absence of ( mandatory ) driving lessons and general lax attitude of many people when it comes to safety of other road users/low amount of police controls ( texting while driving , drunk driving , etc. ), 
  and you get very unsafe traffic . 
  i even read recently that there are a few states where texting while driving is n't illegal . 
  i hardly use my credit card except online so i ca n't really help you , but i just wanted to say that prague/czechia does n't use the euro ( yet ? ) . 
  i hear euros are accepted in some places , but it 's not the official currency . 
  ( i use a debit card , for which you often need to live in the country where the bank is so that 's not really an option for a tourist ), 
  so you already calculated the price of rental vs the price of price of train tickets . 
  if you 're with many people that can indeed soon become an advantage for the car . 
  but you need to add some costs for the car : * tolls , like you said . 
  according to [ viamichelin ] ( http://www.viamichelin.com/web/routes?strstartlocid=31ndi3nxcxmgnore11tnpbek5ett1jtnk0eu5qwxlodz09&amp;strdestlocid=31ndi3nxcxmgnore11tnpbek5ett1jtnk0eu5qwxlodz09&amp;strstep1locid=31ndj2ddmxmgnorgd1t0rvmk9eut1jtwk0ek5urxdodz09&amp;strstep2locid=31m2nrcdewy05uqxvnvev3t1rzpwnpqzqytnprme9rpt0=&amp;strstep3locid=31mzhkedewy05uqxvnrgczt0rfpwnnvff1tkrjd05ewt0=&amp;strstep4locid=31ndmwddixmgnorfv1tkrzek5qtt1jt1m0ee9ez3hndz09&amp;intitinerarytype=1&amp;caravanehidden=false&amp;vh=car&amp;strvehicle=0&amp;itinerarycartype=0&amp;itineraryfueltype=0&amp;isfavoriseautoroute=false&amp;isavoidpeage=false&amp;isavoidvignette=false&amp;isavoidlnr=false&amp;isavoidfrontiers=false&amp;dtmdeparture=06%2f06%2f2015&amp;distance=km&amp;devise=1.0 | eur & indemnite = & carbcost = 1.6 & autoconso = 6.8 & villeconso = 6 & routeconso = 5.6 ) that 's about $ 140 for this trip . 
  of course this depends heavily on the route you take . 
  * fuel . 
  viamichelin estimates it at about $ 370 for a petrol hatchback , but that 's a very rough estimate . 
  prices ( per liter ! ), 
  in the different countries can be found [ here ] ( http://www.fuel-prices-europe.info/ ) . 
  that 's an average and it 'll be a little more expensive for you because you 'll probably stick to the highways and larger cities where fuel prices are often higher than average . 
  * ( perhaps ) extra km driven for the rental car . 
  sometimes there 's a limit on how many km you can drive per day . 
  if you drive more than that they charge you per km . 
  unlimited-km rental cars exist , but they 're obviously more expensive . 
  * parking and travel from the car park to the city centre . 
  you 're probably not going to want to park inside the city centre as that 's where space is scarce and therefore parking is expensive . 
  there 's usually park & rides somewhere outside the centre with a good connection with public transportation , with often ( but not always ) either parking or the transportation free . 
  * maybe navigation or highway/street maps or something for the train you basically only have to add the transportation in the city itself and if you 're young it 's optional as the tourist sites in most cities are perfectly walkable . 
  as you said , most train stations are in the centre . 
  safety is good for both the train and the car . 
  the roads in europe are much safer than in the us ( except belgium 's ) . 
  accidents are unlikely if you drive calmly . 
  per km the train is still a little safer . 
  that 's injuries however , on the train you might be a little more likely to get robbed or something , but i 've never even seen that happen . 
  if you have your belongings in sight ( and with a group that 's even easier ) i do n't think this is a real danger . 
  i do n't know what places on the road you 'd like to visit , but i doubt there 's no public transportation going there . 
  instead of a high speed train you can take another type of train and get out somewhere on the line . 
  the advantage of avoiding border crossing hassles i do n't really get . 
  you 're staying within the schengen zone so apart from some signs and the changing of the lamp post design you might not notice the border by car either . 
  countries are allowed to do random border checks on both trains and cars , but that almost never happens . 
  also keep in mind cars in europe have a manual gearbox unless otherwise specified . 
  if that 's not what you want pay attention when renting the car . 
  if you decide to go with the car i advise you to look up the names of the cities you want to go to in their own language ( and maybe the language of the country before that ) as highway signs are almost exclusively monolingual . 
  i speak french , so i googled around . 
  [ this infographic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pylip6g.jpg ) specifies the growth from 1975 to 2006 ( the top one ) , but only the top 25 of cities of 50 000 inhabitants and over , and not in the form of a list . 
  montpellier seems to be somewhere between 5th and 7th place . 
  [ this website ] ( http://www.toutes-les-villes.com/villes-croissance.html ) ranks the cities by percentage of growth in 10 years . 
  according to it , montpellier is in 191st place ( of 899 ) . 
  however , it does n't specify what years that was in and the numbers do n't seem to be recent ( i 'm thinking 1990-2000 or somewhere close ) . 
  i think the [ french statistics agency insee ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/theme.asp?theme=2&amp;nivgeo=0&amp;type=&amp;produit=ok ) should have the data , but i ca n't find a publication with the data you 're looking for . 
  apart from the options already mentioned , maybe you can buy/rent/loan a [ bicycle carrier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bicycle_carrier ) ( and a car if you do n't have one ) and drive it across the border . 
  another option is to leave your bike in spain ( sell it or stall it ) and buy a new one in france . 
  there 's a separate category for bicycles on [ le bon coin ] ( http://www.leboncoin.fr/velos/offres/ ) ( french ebay ) for example . 
  instead of buying one you could also get a subscription for a bike sharing system , such as v\u00e9lib ' ( paris ) or v\u00e9lo ' v ( lyon ) or [ one of the many others ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_des_syst%c3%a8mes_de_v%c3%a9los_en_libre-service_en_france ) . 
  it 's usually very cheap , but of course it comes with some disadvantages too . 
  if you want to return the rental car in a different country from the one you picked it up , you 'll probably be stuck to the big companies . 
  they often charge a one way fee for returning it elsewhere . 
  it might be very expensive , but sometimes it 's not that expensive if you keep the car for a long time . 
  as far as i know the general rule for rental cars is that they ca n't leave europe , as a continent ( so you can go into turkey , but not the asian part ... and you could n't take it to the canary islands or ceuta even though those areas belong to spain ) . 
  no problem to take it out of schengen , but you 'll have to have a passport and check out if you need visa or something ( probably not , but it depends on where you 're from ) . 
  however , check the rental contract before you sign . 
  every company has ( slightly ) different rules and even the people working there might not know the exact details of what is and is n't allowed . 
  about your destinations : keep in mind there 's some unrest in macedonia at the moment and while it will probably calm down , check travel information before you go . 
  also the relationship between kosovo and serbia is n't great . 
  you will not be able to enter serbia if kosovo stamped your passport . 
  in slovenia you 're passing right by maribor , might be worth the delay checking that out too . 
  i do n't notice any difference using my debit card between the netherlands and another eurozone country . 
  no fees . 
  do n't think i 've ever heard anything like that , and i watch the news very regularly . 
  i listened back to thursday 's news programs of the two major news broadcasters in the netherlands ( when is conquered the syrian city palmyra ) and they said more or less the same thing : * nos : first `` terrorist movement islamic state '' and later `` islamic state '' ( nos is a public , non-commercial broadcaster ) * rtl : both `` terrorist organization islamic state '' and `` islamic state '' ( rtl is a commercial broadcaster ), 
  if you 're female , not a problem at all . 
  if you 're male , still not really a problem but you might have some people looking at you . 
  what do you usually order when you go out to eat in your home country ? 
  and in addition to ordering stuff redditors tell you to order i advise to look up a phrase to tell you 're allergic in the local languages , to be safe . 
  they can always use an ingredient or something that contains lactose even if that 's normally not in it .
