  they are just holidays named after saints . 
  impression of how many emergency vehicles there were ( and of roads getting closed down and people still on it confused ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3turr72qbg for those not aware what this is about : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_airlines_flight_1951, 
  in most countries it is appreciated . 
  especially if you ask `` do you speak english ? '', 
  in the native language before switching . 
  in the netherlands i 'd say it does n't really matter , as long as you 're polite in english . 
  they can do that today without abolishing the 1 and 2 cent coins . 
  they do n't because there 's a reason for having $ 1.99 instead of $ 2 on the price label . 
  that psychological difference is pretty big even if the actual difference that you pay is nothing or almost nothing . 
   their abolition will make the citizen pay between one and four cents more per item , forever of course this would be unpopular . 
  it 's also not how it would go . 
  .01 , .02 , .06 and .07 are rounded down . 
  .03 , .04 , .08 and .09 are rounded up . 
  but you 're not obliged to round up yourself . 
  if you always pay `` passend '' it will save you a cent per trip on average as you can round down when possible and choose not to round up . 
  for most people it will just be 0 cents difference on average . 
  it exists since tomorrow . 
  2015 is the first one . 
  it 's mostly correct , but from the text below ** only the first sentence ** ( non-italic ) is present on the dutch website :  jewish colonists live in illegal west bank settlements and organize demonstrations regularly around and on the road . 
  * these colonists are sometimes violent . 
  at times , these colonists throw stones at palestinians and international vehicles so be alert when traveling around settlements of jewish colonists , especially in the hills around nablus and hebron . 
  * of course the italic part could have been there in the past and have been removed , but if that 's the case it was before january of this year ( when the page was last updated ) . 
  right now the text on both the palestine and [ israel travel advise ] ( http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/reisadviezen/israel ) pages seem very neutral . 
  the only `` blaming '' i can see is in the quoted sentence above with the adjective `` jewish '' . 
  but they 're not saying they 're causing violence , it says that there are demonstrations and tensions sometimes because of the fact that they 're there . 
  it 's true that the whole countries are considered a security risk , as can be seen in the maps below . 
  but that 's the norm for countries in which there is unrest . 
  the whole of ukraine is also considered a security risk ( of course there are areas in the east which are more than that ) , while most people will tell you that it 's safe to go kyiv or lviv . 
  * [ israel ] ( http://roimg.nl/bestanden/afbeeldingen/bz/reisadviezen/i/israel/reisadvies-israel-29-1-2015-620.png ) * [ palestine ] ( http://roimg.nl/bestanden/afbeeldingen/bz/reisadviezen/p/palestijnse-gebieden/reisadvies-palestijnse-gebieden-26-1-2015-620.jpg ) * for comparison : [ ukraine ] ( http://roimg.nl/bestanden/afbeeldingen/bz/reisadviezen/o/oekraine/reisadvies-oekraine-23-1-2015-620.png ) ( for all these : red is `` do n't travel here '' , orange is `` do n't travel here unless necessary '' , yellow is `` attention , security risks '' , green is `` no special security risks '' ) the only country i could find where there were both red and green areas was [ japan ] ( http://roimg.nl/bestanden/afbeeldingen/bz/reisadviezen/j/japan/reisadvies-japan-8-5-2015-620.png ) , where the exclusion zone near fukushima was red but the rest was green . 
  they 're probably just saying that when there 's unrest in one part , pay attention in the other parts of the country . 
  in japan 's case it 's not about unrest , so that does n't count . 
  i count 8 with at least one seat in the danish parliament . 
  people gave him shit ? 
  i thought it was pretty funny ( although i guess it could fit the thread ) [ here 's the clip ] ( https://youtu.be/axgx7vh2pny?t=7m20s ) . 
  he 's doing an interview on a comedy show , so instead of a normal interview he gets an extra task with it . 
  here the task is to include the macarena , the question is what he thinks of the current government . 
  he answers while doing the macarena : `` rutte and samson think they reach out their hand to us , but in reality they 're begging for money and are left with empty hands . 
  i am worried about employment , while diederik samson leans back . 
  ow , it makes me sick to my stomach . '', 
  young people flee ( former ) east germany , probably mostly for work . 
  well you ca n't really have a trade agreement with the us without supporting the us and supporting intercontinental trading . 
  what i named there were downsides of trade agreements in general . 
  you can still be against it , because the us violates human rights ( guantanamo bay is the best example ) and want to make a statement or because you believe in producing everything `` locally '' . 
  me too, 
  this poll would definitely benefit from some nuance . 
  there 's a huge difference between `` i do n't want this trade agreement '' and `` i do n't want any trade agreement '' . 
  gas cooking ? 
  larger house in france ? 
  less well insulated ? 
  it depends on the way the country votes , as one nation or separated : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_to_the_european_parliament#country_by_country, 
  we have something called amber alert too . 
  2 million people , ~ 1/8th of the country , have opted in to receive the alerts on their phones but the alert is broadcast in a lot of other different ways too so that more than 10 million ( ~ 2/3rd ) see the alert . 
  more info : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amber_alert#netherlands, 
  have we hugged it to death ? 
  i hear very bad stories about them . 
  tiny seats . 
  zero customer service . 
  long stops to wait for other passengers , to switch drivers or for what seems like nothing . 
  fat drunks vomiting around you or shitting their pants . 
  i 've met nobody who traveled with them who would do it again ( these people must exist as eurolines is quite large , it 's probably a lot of confirmation bias ) . 
  there are better bus services , but their network is less extensive . 
  you 'll probably always have tiny seats traveling by bus , but okay . 
  there 's megabus , idbus , deutsche bahn ic bus , and probably plenty of others . 
  maybe [ blablacar ] ( https://www.blablacar.com/ ) is a better choice if you 're flexible with dates and want affordable travel . 
  it 's people going from city to city with their own car and letting you go with them for a small fee . 
  make sure you have a working mobile phone so you can call and receive calls in europe if you use this . 
  you wo n't save on hotels , though . 
  the method ilga europe uses is flawed , though . 
  let 's say they want x against homosexuals to be illegal ( x can be discrimination/abuse/etc . ) . 
  if it is illegal in a country , but it 's not separate from the general law against x that does n't specify sexuality , ilga says the country apparently is n't treating them equally . 
  in a case like that ilga is actually considering inequality positive . 
  i bet more european people/redditors can name the prime minister of the uk than the pm/president of slovenia . 
  probably also has something to do with the language . 
  huge news about whatever country is probably available in english very quickly and is often posted , but for smaller things ( like this ) it sometimes takes a day or two before it 's available in english , if that happens at all . 
  that is n't the case for the uk : it 's already in english . 
  and the uk is a big country that most people here know at least something about . 
  i can see it . 
  shape helps . 
  it 's the same color as iceland and norway ( 50-150 ) , in both 2008 and 2010 . 
  yep , netherlands too . 
  it 's a childish version of the word `` ass '' ( not unlike `` bottom '' in english ) . 
  i believe you ~ ~ use ~ ~ misuse our word for `` poo '' ( `` poep '' ) for it . 
  how do we know they used adobe photoshop and not microsoft paint ? 
  it sounds that those languages are in a similar situation as frisian in the netherlands . 
  it 's only official in one province ( frysl\u00e2n ) and not in the whole country . 
  it 's not an official language in the eu . 
  the difference is that the frisians do n't really seem to care . 
  every single one of them speaks dutch too and most of them speak english as well . 
  there is also no serious independence movement , which is probably related to that . 
  ( another difference is that there are about a half million native speakers of frisian , compared to over four million for catalan ... but apparently the number of ( native ) speakers does n't really matter to the eu ), 
  many dutch people will switch to english if you do n't speak dutch fluently . 
  probably paper from trees ( and recycled former trees ) . 
  uk votes on paper , so nature i guess ? 
  can confirm . 
  a black suzuki swift . 
  some people ca n't pronounce the ` th ' ( which does n't exist in dutch ) and prefer the easier `` holland '' for that reason . 
  there are also people who do n't care about the difference , these people are often ( but not always ) from the holland region . 
  in formal contexts always use `` netherlands '' . 
  in informal contexts you can use `` holland '' but some people might get offended or will explain that it 's not the name of the country , so `` netherlands '' is still preferable . 
  andorra and gibraltar are part of iberia too !,
