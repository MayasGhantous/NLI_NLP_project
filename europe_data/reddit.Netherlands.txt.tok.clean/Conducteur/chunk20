  ( my nightmare story as a waiter was when a foreigner pointed out something on the menu and later , while eating , she cried because it turns out there was meat in it ... she was vegetarian but did n't tell me . 
  i still feel horrible about it even though it was n't my fault ) in french you could say `` je suis allergique aux produits laitiers '' [ zyuh-swee ah-lair-zyeek o pro-dwee leh-tyay ] ( i am allergic to dairy products ), 
  or [ one of the many others ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_party ) . 
  i think it 's more the `` how are you ? '', 
  as a greeting , especially to strangers . 
  you could just as well leave out the question mark because an answer is not expected . 
  asking acquaintances how they are is fine , but expect an answer . 
  `` what 's up ? '', 
  might be even worse . 
  what are you even asking ? 
  what 's new in my life ? 
  i 've never met you before so i guess my birth counts !, 
  in cities it 's also not very common to greet strangers on the street in general ( even with normal greetings ) , except maybe when it 's really early or something and there are only a few people on the street . 
  the smaller the town gets , the more common it is to greet strangers on the street , in my experience . 
  it 's basically the same , but in 2012 the wikitravel community `` migrated '' to wikivoyage , because people were unhappy with the host . 
  [ more information about this migration ] ( http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/wikivoyage/migration/faq ), 
  in addition to any answers here you should definitely check [ wikivoyage ] ( https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/main_page ) if you have n't already . 
  i think it 'll be very helpful to you . 
  without specifying your preferences , your budget or how much time you have it 'll be difficult to get any help . 
  the only thing we know now is that you start your travels in july , you live in the uk ( i assume not a native based on the language ) and have family in belgium . 
  my advice : look around on google and wikivoyage to get ideas . 
  -- rule 4 ( see sidebar ) : `` travel related questions must be specific . 
  google exists !, 
  do your research before you ask . '', 
  will you be traveling in multiple countries ? 
  because it will be almost impossible to find something cheap that will work across europe . 
  you will be able to use it in other countries than the one it 's from , but there 's almost always extra fees . 
  the only exception i know of was recently in the news : [ vodafone hungary ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/04/01/vodafone-hungary-abolishes-roaming-charges/ ) . 
  i would recommend to buy something in the first country you arrive in . 
  the country pages of [ wikivoyage ] ( https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/main_page ) usually have a section `` connect '' near the bottom of the page that includes information about the mobile phone providers . 
  if you want more information , specify the country . 
  depending on your plans , i 'd either buy a new sim card for the next country ( if you 'll stay there for a long time ) or continue using the sim card from the first country and pay a little extra ( if you wo n't ) . 
  however , you might not need the data . 
  almost all hotels and hostels have wifi , many cities offer wifi hotspots and if the city you 're in does n't it 'll probably be easy to find a caf\u00e9 that does . 
  and with apps like citymaps2go or google maps you can download maps beforehand to use them offline later , that gps locator thingy will still work without a data plan . 
  spain has plenty of pretty villages and impressive landscapes in large parts of the country . 
  iceland is gorgeous as well and a car is a really good way to explore all of it . 
  and i 've not been there myself ( yet !, 
  ) , but i hear scotland and ireland have beautiful landscapes that are probably best accessible by car . 
  actually , rental cars are available for 21-year-olds . 
  different agencies require different ages , sometimes you can even get one at 18 . 
  in some cases you may rent but it 'll cost more or there are special conditions . 
  some agencies require a minimum amount of years of driving experience instead of age ( which means they look at the date when you got your license ) . 
  i even found that [ sixt espa\u00f1a ] ( http://www.sixt.es/precios-y-reservas/descuentos-para-estudiantes/ ) and [ hertz espa\u00f1a ] ( https://www.hertz.es/rentacar/specialoffers/index.jsp?targetpage=eu_student_car_rental.jsp ) give discounts to students , advertising to 18-year-olds and 19-year-olds-with-at-least-1-year-experience , respectively . 
  it may still be better/cheaper to buy your own car , especially if you 'll want a car for the entire summer , but do n't dismiss renting just yet . 
  ( i do n't know much about buying a car , so i 'll leave those questions unanswered ) most travelers use public transportation in europe to get around . 
  it 's much better than in the usa . 
  if you 'll stick to the bigger cities i 'd definitely check that out . 
  99 % of cities in europe were n't built for cars , so to get the historic/touristic parts you 'll probably take public transportation anyway ( while paying a premium to park your car ) . 
  maybe you can combine the two , if you mostly stick to the bigger cities but also want to go somewhere that 's not ( well ) accessible by public transportation for example . 
  many of the larger train stations have a car rental agency in the same building or just around the corner . 
  also note that your american driver 's license may not be valid in europe ( especially italy ) . 
  i recommend looking into getting an `` international driving permit '' . 
  they 're not that common in most parts of france either , but in some places they are common . 
  most notably the south east of the country near the mediterranean coast in cities like saint tropez , cannes , nice and the country of monaco . 
  that 's probably your best bet . 
  also , paris is pretty huge so i 'm sure you can rent luxury cars somewhere in the city . 
  i found [ europe luxury car hire ] ( https://europeluxurycarhire.com/ ) and [ king rent ] ( http://www.kingrent.com/europe-rental-location/france.html ) with a quick google search . 
  but some common rental companies also rent out this type of car in specific agencies . 
  for example try [ europcar ] ( https://www.europcar.fr/ebe/module/render/vehicules-prestige ) , [ hertz ] ( https://www.hertz.fr/rentacar/vehicleguide/index.jsp?targetpage=vehicleguidehomeview.jsp&amp;countrycode=fr&amp;category=dream%20collection ) or [ sixt ] ( http://www.sixt.fr/vehicules/ ) ( select `` voitures de sport '' and/or `` cabriolet '' ) . 
  i think you can google too . 
  it might help to know some relevant french words : louer = to rent location = rental voiture de luxe = luxury car cabriolet = convertible you are usually expected to contact them personally to get the real price , as the prices on the website may be different ( city specific or low season only or something like that ) . 
  they often require a credit card and a decent deposit so make sure your credit card 's limit is n't too low ( and it ca n't be a prepaid credit card btw ) . 
  at airports within the schengen zone there 's almost always two separate passport controls , one for everyone and a `` fast lane '' for schengen citizens . 
  in my experience , in that `` fast lane '' someone takes two looks at your passport and you 're in the country . 
  i doubt they 'll even read your place of birth and even if they do that 's not a reason to stop you . 
  uk is n't in schengen and i 've never gone from outside europe to the uk so i do n't know how it goes there , but i 'm certain you 'll be able to enter with your portuguese passport . 
  the netherlands can compete : the island of [ rottumerplaat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rottumerplaat ) has 0 people / km \u00b2, 
  we were taught uk english , but us was accepted too as long as you did n't switch between uk and us every other sentence . 
  looks like around 50 usd is indeed what the train costs if you book early . 
  note that if you 're under 26 years old there are some other cheaper tickets ( around 45 usd ) , but the difference is n't that big . 
  if you 're really looking to save money you could try the bus . 
  the ones i know are : [ megabus ] ( http://uk.megabus.com ) ( cheapest i 've found for 22 usd , more commonly 30 usd ) , [ idbus ] ( http://www.idbus.com/ ) ( cheapest i 've found for 22 usd , more commonly 43 usd ) or [ eurolines ] ( http://eurolines.com/en/ ) ( i 've heard bad stories about that one , but have never taken them myself . 
  cheapest i 've found for 40 usd ) another option to save money would be ride sharing . 
  i have many good experiences ( and one bad ) with the biggest one : [ blablacar ] ( https://www.blablacar.co.uk/ride-sharing/london/paris/#?fn=london&amp;fc=51.507351 | -0.127758 & fcc = gb & tn = paris % 2c + france & tc = 48.856614 | 2.352222 & tcc = fr & sort = trip_date & order = asc & limit = 50 & page = 1 ) . 
  it all depends on what you want , but keep in mind where you 're dropped off and check how much it costs ( usually a metro ticket or rer ticket , differences are n't that big then ) or how much time it takes to get from there to your destination . 
  also note that there is no road tunnel between the uk and france , so with bus or ride sharing you 'll be taking a train or boat for crossing the channel anyway ( should be included in the price ) . 
  you can start by fixing the typo in the title of the sub . 
   it says `` debat europe '' instead of `` debate europe '' . 
  ^ ( unless you were going for french , in which case it 's `` d\u00e9bat europe '' , or dutch `` debat europa '' ) not sure about your other questions , i have little experience modding and zero experience starting and popularizing a sub . 
  but i like the idea of the sub and have subscribed . 
  if you get desperate , you can put me on the mod list or try / r/needamod . 
  they are ( more ) conservative on some issues , like abortion and euthanasia . 
  maybe that 's why . 
  the current government has even tried to further limit abortion laws ( but i think they did n't in the end because of protests ) . 
  cities do n't re-enter once they 've won as the point of the fietsstad program is n't to rank the best city and get only a few cities to improve their cycling infrastructure and compete every year , but to improve cycling across the country . 
  copenhagen advertises itself as a huge cycling city , but it is n't all as impressive as they make it out to be : * http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2009/12/truth-about-copenhagen.html * http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2011/01/busiest-cycle-street-in-world.html on the other hand , amsterdam could do better too . 
  there are some other cities in the netherlands which beat both of them easily . 
  a ) and 3 ) check the low cost air lines such as airberlin , germanwings , easyjet , tuifly , ryanair and wizzair . 
  for the high season you have to book early !, 
  b ) that 's a good idea , but it 's possible to combine spain with something in eastern europe with a cheap plane ticket . 
  you could also use the ferries : spain-italy and italy-albania or something . 
  however , i think the ferries vary little in price so it might get pretty expensive , look around !, 
  c ) depends on what you like . 
  there are plenty of season bound activities , but nothing is a must-see for everyone . 
  maybe the keukenhof ( the huge flower fields in the netherlands ) is your cup of tea , which is only open for 2 months per year . 
  maybe you like to go to easter festivities in spain , which are only during one week ( around easter , who would have guessed ? ) . 
  maybe you like to go skiing someplace , which is mostly in winter/early spring . 
  do n't forget the weather plays a major role in what are low and high seasons , so traveling in the low season might be uncomfortably cold or uncomfortably hot . 
  1 ) on the map they definitely cut the majority of stations and even a huge amount of lines .
