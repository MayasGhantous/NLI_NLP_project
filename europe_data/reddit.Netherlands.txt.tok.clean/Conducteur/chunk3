  the royal dutch football association ( knvb ) has taken a stand against blatter , by sending a potential replacement for blatter for the presidential elections this year and publicly supporting him ( michael van praag ) . 
  the [ suriname football association ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/04/26/uk-soccer-fifa-vanpraag-idukkbn0nh0eq20150426 ) publicly promised to vote for him . 
  several famous dutch football players ( including johan cruijff and patrick kluivert ) [ support his candidacy ] ( http://www.michaelvanpraag.com/blog/ ) as well . 
   he 'd get 20 if elections were held now yeah , polls do n't mean much ... especially with wilders ' voters . 
  he 's always doing much better in the polls than in real elections . 
  many people who do n't care about politics say they 'll vote for him but in the end it turns out they do n't care about politics so they do n't want to spend a few minutes cycling to the voting booth . 
  no , the statistics netherlands link above says ( in dutch ) that it 's the average over those five years . 
  both in text ( although not consistently ) and in their interactive graph . 
  the average french worker striked 0.171 days per year . 
  the `` per year '' was n't in the graph itself so i did n't include it in the translation , but i 've now changed that . 
  the per 1000 is probably just to get more legible figures . 
  the online newspaper does have [ this italian striker ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qsglvzo.jpg ) accompanying the graph but that 's the only mention of italy . 
  ** average number of days on strike per 1000 employees per year , between 2009 and 2013 .

  source of the graph : [ volkskrant ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/economie/frankrijk-europees-kampioen-staken~a3991932/ ) ( dutch newspaper ) . 
  euthanasia for children of 12 years and older is legal . 
  younger children can also be `` euthanized '' under special conditions ( laid out in the groningen protocol ) but it 's not called euthanasia because that requires informed consent under dutch law . 
  both are very rare , though . 
  netherlands too : [ one ] ( http://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/images/ro_vw_rw~li.png ) [ two ] ( http://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldontwerp/bld/resources/9dd7e52b-e7a7-4758-9a51-0b49b984ae0e/logo.png ), 
  going ... 
  word for word : greeks ... 
   does n't life imprisonment give society the same protection , albeit at higher costs ? 
  i will immediatly mention that i consider the argument ` the death penalty is cheaper ' extremely immoral and inhumane . 
  life imprisonment has actually been shown to be less expensive than the death penalty ( [ one source ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2011/09/22/death-and-taxes-the-real-cost-of-the-death-penalty/ ) , with google it 's easy to find others though ), 
  the article definitely has a point . 
  but if you 're ( also ) in education you 're by definition not a neet . 
  if a part time job is the only thing ( so no education or training ) it becomes more difficult . 
  maybe for the next chart they could use full time equivalents ( so 2 people working 20hrs/week counts as one employed and one unemployed person ) , so it would be less misleading in this aspect . 
  thank you . 
  if that is indeed the article he 's talking about , ignoring those jobs would n't lower the number in this chart though . 
  the article says those part time jobs by youngsters are for extra money next to studying ( which , for now , still includes a salary for studying : `` study financing '' ) . 
  the chart excludes people in education or training as well as in employment . 
  would you mind providing a source for that ? 
  i ca n't find the research you 're talking about using google , in neither english nor dutch . 
  we may have a crappy score , but we beat finland so we 're happy anyway . 
  on the website of cliniclowns itself there 's also an international bank account number ( iban ) mentioned : nl31ingb0000006640 ( which means the bic is ingbnl2a ) . 
  i 'm not entirely sure , but i think you could just donate directly to that number . 
  no service fees for transfers from anywhere in the eu . 
  i think in german the r at the start of a syllable is pronounced differently than the r at the beginning of the word . 
  in `` radfahrer '' for example ( which has both ) , you might notice this more clearly ( and it demonstrates that it 's not because of the double rr which in spanish has a distinct pronunciation and is sometimes even considered a separate letter ) . 
  furthermore , i think / u/silverionmox meant a report that was in the news recently about someone 's doctorate ( [ university article in dutch ] ( http://nieuws.hum.uu.nl/events/koen-sebregts-promoveert-op-de-vele-r-en-van-het-nederlands/ ) , i was unable to find the report itself but it [ looks like he has participated in several reports about the r before ] ( https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=koen+sebregts+r ) ) . 
  below the map it 's mentioned that the pronunciation of the r has more to do with your local accent than the language you 're speaking . 
  if you feel about religion that strongly you should know the netherlands is the [ 5th ** least ** religious country in the world ] ( http://www.itv.com/news/2015-04-13/uk-among-the-least-religious-countries-in-the-world-a-survey-reveals/ ) , despite those lunatics in the bible belt ( belgium is n't in the top 7 , but where exactly they are is n't specified ), 
  both in norway and the netherlands english is spoken by almost everybody . 
  i think that 's the language they speak with each other . 
  someone said elsewhere in the thread that it 's a conservative party , so i think i know the answer now . 
  are they saying islamism should stop because it 's like nazism or are they saying the nazi-like ideas against islamism should stop ? 
  in other words : are these guys for or against islam ? 
  i could interpret the poster both ways ( i do n't speak danish ) . 
  i think the dutch prisons are n't that different from most nordic ones . 
  because the norwegians do n't have enough cells , [ a few hundred norwegian criminals are in dutch prisons ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2014/09/hundreds_of_norwegian_criminal/ ) . 
  the prisons may not be as modern as their newest ones , because in the netherlands there 's a lot of overcapacity when it comes to prisons so we do n't need to build new ones . 
  i assume new dutch prisons would be more modern as well . 
  they all have a functional democracy and have had one for quite some time . 
  other things that you can reuse also cost money : cradle , clothes , baby bottles , etc. 
  i suppose that last thing could be because of that . 
  like child benefit ? 
  i think that exists in almost every country in europe . 
  [ sartre ] ( http://www.attitudes-roadsafety.eu/index.php?eid=tx_nawsecuredl&amp;u=0&amp;file=uploads/media/sartre-4-booklet.pdf&amp;t=1428956041&amp;hash=2c6cf19562833bd79fdfcc336f5fc61c ) ( pdf-alert , `` social attitudes to road traffic risk in europe '' ) is about europe but does n't include denmark . 
  good luck pronouncing \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u044c or even kr\u00e1snaya pl\u00f3shchad . 
  do n't you think red square is easier ? 
  by the way , if you want to start a new line but not a new paragraph you need to place three or more spaces and the end of the previous line . 
  or you can use a * and a space at the start of every line to make a list . 
  `` hen '' is a female chicken in dutch , but it can also be the gender neutral pronoun `` them '' ( so different from the one in swedish ) . 
  popular to watch are also speed skating and cycling . 
  baseball or softball are played in almost every high school pretty regularly . 
  do n't know if that 's the case in every country , but it could count for something . 
  actually euthanasia for minors above 12yo was legal in the netherlands before euthanasia for ** adults ** was even legal in belgium . 
  it has always been the age limit here . 
  you were the first with legal euthanasia without an age limit , since 2014 . 
  however , in the netherlands euthanasia for minors under 12yo has been tolerated ( technically illegal but not prosecuted ) since 2004 [ under some extra conditions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groningen_protocol ) so you could argue that we were also first with that . 
  once again , belgium is ^ ( almost ) equal to ( netherlands + france ) / 2 only this time it 's because the three are equal to each other . 
  and we had a sea in the middle of the country that 's now a fresh water lake with a lot of artificial land and even cities . 
  / u/citronbleu used the word `` actual '' which used to mean `` current '' / `` at the moment '' . 
  it still does mean that in a lot of other languages including french , but in english it has lost that meaning, 
  [ this is a video from july 2012 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrb8nurnjso ) ( he 's the first one ) . 
  he was captured in november 2011 . 
  just because you do n't follow the news regularly does n't mean 99 % of dutch people do n't . 
  it fits well that `` pot '' can mean toilet in dutch ( similar to `` can '' in english ), 
  not only could data be outdated ( the way i read it is 2010 for albania and 2012 for the other countries ) , but also ... 
  different countries use different ways to calculate unemployment . 
  that means you ca n't compare them to each other . 
  eurostat uses one definition for all countries to be able to compare them , but of course numbers may differ from the ones you hear in your own country . 
  the spoken version of the dutch version ( `` welkom '' ) is on [ wiktionary ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/welkom#dutch ) ( [ direct link ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/nl-welkom.ogg ) ), 
  germans do love their kebab though . 
  [ netherlands and finland are at 29 and 29.7 percent ] ( http://i100.independent.co.uk/image/30780-1wd5qm1.jpg ) respectively , so they fall in the yellow category but barely .
