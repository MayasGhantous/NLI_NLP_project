  with the high speed train it 's [ 19 ] ( http://www.ns.nl/en/journeyplanner/#/reisdetails?vertrek=rotterdam%20centraal&amp;vertrektype=treinstation&amp;aankomst=schiphol%20airport&amp;aankomsttype=treinstation&amp;tijd=2016-11-14t14:05&amp;type=vertrek&amp;hash=1734857430 ) ( thalys ) or [ 25 ] ( http://www.ns.nl/en/journeyplanner/#/reisdetails?vertrek=rotterdam%20centraal&amp;vertrektype=treinstation&amp;aankomst=schiphol%20airport&amp;aankomsttype=treinstation&amp;tijd=2016-11-14t14:05&amp;type=vertrek&amp;hash=1850755973 ) ( intercity direct ) minutes . 
  however , the high speed trains are not going to schiphol this weekend because they 're working on the railways there . 
  our freight trains face fierce competition from the inland ships . 
  ships are slower and very inflexible , but they are chosen because it 's cheapest ( one ship with very few people can carry a huge amount of containers ) . 
  trains are more expensive , but ca n't make up much in terms of flexibility . 
  they 're faster , but most of the containers arriving in rotterdam are probably not bound much by time anyway ( otherwise they would be shipped by air , not maritime ship , in the first place ) . 
  to complete the picture , trucks are the most expensive , but are extremely flexible . 
  on short distances companies just do n't bother putting something on a train or ship , and then having to do the `` last mile '' by truck anyway . 
  most people ( and therefore most freight destinations ) in the netherlands and belgium live within such a `` short distance '' from rotterdam . 
  freight trains are also used much less than in places like north america and russia because [ double stacking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double-stack_rail_transport ) is not possible here due to our electrified railways , and extremely long trains are also not possible ( i believe the legal ** maximum ** in the nl is 650m , the ** average ** in the us is 2km ) because of our population density . 
  if it had to stand still somewhere it would block too many railway crossings , and it 's more difficult to fit in between the [ huge amount of passenger trains ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k6bemiqhdo ) . 
  therefore the price per container for rail is increased by a lot . 
  with the relatively recent [ betuwe route ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betuweroute ) both of these concerns have been addressed , however : there are no railway crossings on the entire line , no passenger trains use the line and tunnels and bridges are high enough for double stacking . 
  this means that the train becomes cheaper and therefore more competitive . 
  from the containers that arrive from a maritime ship in rotterdam : * 34.2 % will go back on another maritime ship * 23.5 % will continue on an inland ship * 35.1 % will continue on trucks * 7.2 % will continue on freight trains ( 2014 data , [ source ] ( https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/files/modal-split-maritieme-containers-2014-2011 ) ), 
  for the numbers that say + x you add x to the posted speed limit . 
  compared to sweden , we may be relatively tolerant to high speeds , but i do n't think we 're extremely tolerant . 
  we have decent fines ( we often tell ourselves they 're among the highest in the world , though they seem pretty average if the info on speedingeurope is correct ) . 
  and i think speed controls may be more common in the netherlands so you 're more likely to get a fine if you speed . 
  the traffic enforcement camera was a dutch invention , as was the average speed control ( where they measure every car 's average speed over a long stretch of motorway and automatically fine you if it 's too high ) . 
  more likelihood to get caught also means fines do n't need to be as high to get the same change in behaviour . 
  but i think you 're right about the innovation regarding transportation . 
  the `` shared space '' that you refer to is also a dutch invention ( though it 's controversial even here ) and we are among the frontrunners in electric driving ( only norway is above us i believe ) . 
  it varies a lot by country and often also depends on the situation , past offenses , etc. 
  speeding fines in the netherlands seem pretty average . 
  far below the nordics . 
  in the netherlands police can use their judgment in exceptional circumstances like that too . 
  i 've seen multiple examples where they just copy down personal details and let the offender go . 
  later they 'll verify if the circumstances were true , maybe look at past offenses and they can decide what ( if any ) punishment there will be . 
  / r/sundayexchange has most of them listed too, 
  i had to pick one : * confusion when comparing the two maps because of different color schemes * confusion about colors because legend includes colors that are n't on the map * awkward legend because of skipping colors * awkward legend because of `` empty '' colors i chose the latter option because it causes the least confusion , even if it is n't the best looking choice . 
  i think so . 
  i know foreign driver 's licenses can be taken by dutch police and i do n't see why it would n't be the same across europe . 
  i considered making a map for fines , but it gets complicated very quickly because there are so many different regulations ( discounts for first offense or paying quickly , increases when there are roadworks or the road is wet ) so it does n't really fit on a map . 
  i do n't think you 're quite at the nordic level , by the way . 
  speedingeurope.com shows them as having espcially high fines . 
  * source : http://www.speedingeurope.com - i 'm not sure how accurate all of it is , but the ones that i could verify were correct . 
  the website has more data too , including things like speeding fines . 
  * i 'll recommend [ this motorway speed limit map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/world_speed_limits.svg/2754px-world_speed_limits.svg.png ) next to it if you want to know the highest speed limit in each country . 
  for people that ca n't into proper metric , that map also has approximate conversions to miles per hour for most of these speeds ( also : 50 km/h = 31 mi/h ) . 
  * germany of course does n't have speed limits on some motorways , so you ca n't lose your license for speeding there . 
  some other motorways have a 130 km/h limit , however , and getting caught speeding 41 km/h or more there will lose you your license , which is what the map shows . 
  * interestingly , getting caught driving the polish motorway speed limit ( 140 km/h ) on a swedish motorway will mean your license is taken away . 
  i do n't know if that helps much against that . 
  there are also examples in dutch , like * poepen * which means * pooping * in the netherlands but * fucking * in flanders . 
  do n't forget vocabulary . 
  quite a few differences in what words are commonly used . 
  most famous confusion of them all probably * coger el bus * ( either `` taking the bus '' or `` fucking the bus '' depending on where you live ) . 
  i do n't speak romanian , but i bet spain 's vocabulary is closer to romanian than mexico 's , and therefore easier to understand for romanians . 
  you 're right . 
  i had hoge raad in my mind , not raad van state . 
  the law accounts for that . 
  if there 's any doubt about the mental state or reading capabilities , a doctor decides if the choice or lack of choice `` counts '' . 
  ( source in dutch : [ 4th paragraph ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2129714-d66-past-donorplan-aan-in-hoop-op-steun-kamer.html ) ), 
  i agree , but it 's quite a controversial topic on / r/thenetherlands ( [ thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/52khjl/tweede_kamer_stemt_verrassend_in_met_donorplan/d7l5v2j?context=3 ) ) . 
  for those who do n't speak dutch : opponents in that thread mostly argue that it 's against our constitutional `` right to inviolability of his person '' . 
  proponents , however , have linked to a supreme court decision from 2013 which says an opt-out donor system does not violate this right . 
  there are also people who think that a government simply should n't actively decide on something like this . 
  [ according to this map ] ( http://www.organdonationrates.org/p/blog-page.html ) , belgium has an opt-out system , like about half of europe . 
  my point was just that it ca n't really be the case that the flemish are at the dutch level and the walloons ( even if we include brussels ) at the french level because then belgium 's level as a whole would be higher . 
  but how do you figure that low population density is a good thing when looking at the us ? 
  the most prosperous parts of the us are the northeast corridor and the cities on the west coast , not exactly rural . 
  same in europe with the blue banana doing very well ( though scandinavia , too , of course ), 
  it 's a bit of a running joke on this subreddit ( or at least it used to be ) , but i 'm having difficulty finding other examples . 
  the equation is true surprisingly often , but of course it 's also regularly not true . 
  probably not , since flanders has a much bigger population . 
  population of belgium is 11.2 million , [ of which ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communities,_regions_and_language_areas_of_belgium#regions ) flanders has 57.5 % , wallonia has 32.0 % and brussels has 10.5 %, 
  once again belgium \u2248 ( netherlands + france ) / 2 works for both the percentage and the ranking : * ( 90.9 +79.2 ) / 2 = 85.1 \u2248 85.3 * ( 3 +20 ) / 2 = 12 \u2248 12, 
  do you know everyone in your `` not big '' town ? 
  or at least all the police officers ? 
  i think / u/veeron 's point is not that reykjavik or iceland is huge , but it 's big enough that you do n't know everyone . 
  he was contradicting that everyone is supposed to know each other ( if not directly , then by extension ) , which makes a lot of sense to me for those population numbers . 
  they did the research . 
  data between 2011 and 2015 for the netherlands : relation of murder victims with their murderer | male victims | female victims | : -- | : -- | : -- | ( ex - ) partner | 6.4 % | 52.0 % | acquaintance or friend | 32.1 % | 12.1 % | parent of the victim | 10.2 % | 8.5 % | other family member | 7.9 % | 9.9 % | related to organized crime | 13.4 % | 2.2 % | no relation | 12.5 % | 9.0 % | other/unknown | 17.5 % | 6.3 % | ( translation of a graph on [ this page ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2016/30/laagste-aantal-moorden-in-20-jaar ) by statistics netherlands ),
