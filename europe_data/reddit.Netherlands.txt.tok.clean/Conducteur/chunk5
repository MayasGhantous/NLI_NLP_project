  we have a very similar system in the netherlands and it always causes several municipalities to have voter participation far above 100 % . 
  they are basically always the same municipalities , though , usually with a low amount of inhabitants and where many people have their second house . 
  did waidhofen have similar results in the past ? 
  or was there some event going on causing so many people to be there on the voting day ? 
  on the official site [ thatmountainwillcome.nl ] ( http://diebergkomter.nl/ ) it does n't say the project is canceled . 
  the last news update from a year ago was still positive , though they were n't sure when they were to start building . 
  the original start date is still on the website , in the graphic : 2012 . 
  so you should take it with more than a grain of salt . 
  enoughtrumpspam is n't on r/popular either so that does n't make sense, 
  the article specifically mentions that the tariffs for consumers remained the same . 
  and that 3.8 million was also government money , so the tax payer pays less for it and the passenger pays the same . 
  however , i agree that it 's a shame that the money that governments saved by these tenders was not used to lower tariffs , but was simply spent elsewhere . 
  it works better than a full monopoly . 
  for example , the first line we tendered in the netherlands was almelo-mari\u00ebnberg , which [ ns made a 3.8 million guilder loss on every year and connexxion could run for less than 1.2 million guilders ] ( https://www.trouw.nl/home/oostnet-gaat-voorlopig-spoorlijn-almelo-marienberg-exploiteren~a3738b92/ ) . 
  ns wanted to cancel the line completely because of the losses , but connexxion and later arriva made it so profitable that prorail thought it was worth upgrading , [ which was done last year . ] ( http://www.railwiki.nl/index.php/spoorlijn_mari%c3%abnberg_-_almelo#wijzigingen ) . 
  many bids are for much longer periods by the way . 
  hence the tendering system we have now in many places outside the region of holland . 
  competition for a temporary monopoly , best of both worlds . 
  cda is open to the idea of leaving it out of the coalition agreement . 
  cu and sgp turned it into a * breekpunt * ( dealbreaker , they wo n't participate in the coalition unless the coalition agreement says the freedom to die wo n't be expanded ) . 
  in the christian parties-debate , cda was attacked on that point by cu and sgp . 
  cda said they are against the expansion but want to keep their options open so they did n't make it a * breekpunt * . 
  i 'm sure the cda would want something in return though . 
   progressive-ish sounding policies that sound good to older voters than tend to get chucked out the moment that they win ( in the latter case , literally within hours ) wilders did that too !, 
  before the 2010 election he made one non-negotiable promise : to not change the standard retirement age . 
  doubled down on that saying it would be treachery to his voters if he let that point go in the negotiations to form a government . 
  the morning after election day , when the results were n't even official yet and no negotiations had started , he let the promise go and denied it was treachery . 
  both of those countries actually had slight majorities in favor if you ignore the people abstaining . 
  and at least in the netherlands free trade is a typical right-wing thing . 
  left-wing parties are often more critical , they voted against here too . 
  right-wing parties have just always had a majority . 
   chocolate rain is that the backdoor equivalent of a golden shower ? 
  [ the horniest city in the world ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drfsxlchrwc ) , even . 
  we have elections in march and it seems possible that the netherlands will move more towards legalization now that the vvd ( conservative liberals ) is more open to it . 
  together with the pvv ( wilders ) and the christian parties they blocked legalization for decades , but the vvd had an internal vote on it recently and they 're now saying there should be `` smarter regulation '' and `` total reform '' of the dutch drugs policy . 
  that means there will probably be a majority to move closer to legalization in a few months . 
  however , the vvd is still not saying they want to fully legalize it , so it 's still unclear what exactly is going to happen . 
  sure !, 
  i do n't know how the exchange will go in terms of language ( afrikaans being a major language in south africa and mutually intelligible with dutch to a degree ) , you might not be able to read everything , but you 're definitely welcome to ask questions . 
  interestingly , / r/thenetherlands will have an exchange with / r/southafrica the same day !, 
  i 'm sure the bruxellois will like that brussels is monolingual in dutch from now on . 
  wait , you do n't know about [ carnaval in the north ] ( https://youtu.be/u7c7emutqzm?t=6 ) ? 
  what surprised me most was portugal , went from having the highest rate in 1960 and 1970 to the lowest from 2012 onwards . 
  the sketch is from new year 's eve 2012 , and in the 2012 world happiness report finland was in 2nd place , netherlands in 4th . 
  ( [ pdf ] ( http://worldhappiness.report/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/04/world_happiness_report_2012.pdf ) , check page 31 ), 
  sorry , failed to copy the last letter . 
  fixed now / here is the right link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaoxw5dzgjk, 
  belgium was too easy to beat so we had to find another country that felt like a real challenge to beat . 
  ( also it 's a reference to [ this dutch comedy sketch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaoxw5dzgjk ) where we beat finland in the important stats like children 's freight bicycle density and royal toilet throwing but finland wins some joke stats like education and happiness ), 
  yeah it 's not complete for the netherlands either . 
  the purple lines are the `` junction network '' and the red lines the `` lf-routes '' ( national cycling routes ) . 
  both for recreational cycling , with a lot of detours to get through the prettiest areas , in many cases actively avoiding cars . 
  there 's a separate network of mostly-straight paths between towns for functional cycling ( though there 's some overlap of course ) . 
  that also explains the apparently huge difference between flanders and wallonia , and small difference between flanders and the netherlands : the junction network was a flemish invention that the netherlands adopted . 
  wallonia is definitely behind in terms of cycling infrastructure , but flanders is also still very much behind the netherlands . 
  similar climate , similar flatness , and at least there will be a small percentage of the required cycle paths already built . 
  the locks are illegal for public pumps in the netherlands . 
  apparently the locks sometimes malfunction ( ed ) causing fire hazards and environmental damage by spilling fuel , and that was considered worse than not having your hands free . 
  not sure if those malfunctions are still a serious problem , but i guess it 's just not a high priority to legalize the locks . 
  i always misread it in my head as idgaf ( i do n't give a fuck ), 
  i 'm not an economist , but i think that would be reflected by [ the median income adjusted for ppp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income#gallup_gross_median_household_income ) , which puts norway ( per capita ) or luxembourg ( per household ) at the top if you 're looking at countries as a whole . 
  it 's mostly false . 
  it 's usually illegal to feed wild animals , it 's definitely not done every winter . 
  it is allowed in special circumstances such as extreme weather or a temporary shortage of natural food that threatens the animal population , but it is strictly monitored that it 's only for maintaining the existing population rather than expanding it . 
  are you sure ping has the right unit ? 
  anyway , 1st is better . 
  great netherlands and greatnetherlandism exist , usually referring to adding flanders to the netherlands , and sometimes combining the whole benelux . 
  there are several politicians in favor of it , but no serious plans are ready afaik . 
  it mostly lives as an annexation joke . 
  after ww ii we also wanted [ to annex some parts of germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_annexation_of_german_territory_after_world_war_ii ) , and a small part of the plan was actually implemented ( though most of the land was returned a decade later ) . 
  nowadays there is n't any serious talk about this anymore , though a lot of jokes are still made . 
  article 1 of the belgian constitution :  belgium is a ** federal ** state composed of communities and regions . 
  i do n't believe spain or the uk are quite as explicit about their federationness . 
  belgium is already a federation , with an increasing amount of power for the three separate regions . 
  spain and the uk also have many properties of a federation , including high levels of self-governance for the autonomous communities/home nations . 
  you made a mistake in the title ( `` celebrities '' is missing ) and this comment seems more appropriate as part of the post ( in the textbox ) . 
  probably an accent or someone exaggerating the harshness of the dutch g/ch-sound for the foreigner . 
  forvo has it : https://forvo.com/word/enschede#nl i do n't think there are other pronunciations in standard dutch ( though in the low saxon dialect it would be '' [ eanske ] ( https://forvo.com/word/nds/eanske/ ) '' , maybe that 's the different pronunciation ? 
  or just the difference between `` soft '' g from the southern part and the `` hard '' g from the rest of the netherlands ? ), 
  it also exists in german , irish , czech , russian and probably many more languages . 
  it might be a majority of european languages . 
  english speakers and french speakers often struggle with it , which might be why many dutch people think it 's a difficult sound , but in my experience most people do n't struggle with it that much . 
  even english speakers seem to pick it up quite quickly with some practice . 
  it would be pronounced the same in dutch . 
  in modern dutch `` uy '' does n't really exist , but i believe it did in older versions because you see it in names like that . 
  there are several that some foreigners find difficult , but in my experience everyone has difficulty with the diphthong '' * [ ui ] ( https://forvo.com/word/ui/#nl ) * '' , even german natives who have an easy time with most other dutch sounds . 
  the language is usually easily understood without the sound though , many just use the english `` ou '' ( e.g. 
  house ) or something similar instead and it works fine . 
  please do some research yourself before asking to be spoonfed everything . 
  just use a journey planner . 
  i love the many pedestrianized areas in the netherlands . 
  without all the noise , wasted space and pollution of so many cars these places become much more pleasant to be . 
  i do n't know norwich , but i do n't see much problem with it . 
  based on the maps in the link it seems quite a small area and they clearly take into account public transport , handicapped people and delivery drivers so it does n't cause problems . 
  all around the pedestrianized area there are car parks , so it ca n't ever be a very long walk to the final destination even if you choose to come by car . 
  is europe a country yet ? 
  several dutch cities do have a europe square . 
  irrelevancy is a valid reason to downvote , and your reply does n't even come close to answering the question . 
  well it depends on a lot of things but you 're not really demanding much so it definitely seems possible . 
  though suburbs do n't really exist here like in the us ( just separate commuter towns , with the proper facilities ) .
