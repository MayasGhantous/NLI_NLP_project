  not sure about e-books , but in the netherlands a system like this does exist for audiobooks : if you 're a library member you get free access to a bunch of audiobooks in the luisterbieb app for phones or tablets . 
  orange , obviously , the national color of the netherlands . 
  after the royal family , the house of orange . 
  the color 's not in our main flag anymore , though an orange `` wimpel '' is often attached [ like this ] ( https://www.mastenenvlaggen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nationale-vlag-ranje-wimpel.jpg ) . 
  well from what i can see it just seems like hockey on natural ice . 
  natural ice is n't that common in the netherlands . 
  you 'll see some most winters , but it 's not always safe to play matches on . 
  the [ dutch marathan on natural ice championship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knsb_dutch_marathon_championships#natural_ice ) is one of the first matches on natural ice that is held as soon as the ice is thick enough anywhere in the netherlands . 
  as indicated on the table there , the last time it was held was in the 2012-2013 winter , so the last 4 winters we have n't seen very thick ice . 
  the legendary [ 11 cities tour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elfstedentocht ) has n't been held since 1996-1997 because the ice has n't been thick enough . 
  i do n't think a sport could gain much popularity in if it can only be played for a week every few years . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/underwater_hockey based on the number of teams that seems to be more popular here than ice hockey , though definitely still niche . 
  and i 've never heard of bandy . 
  to show that the team that 's by far the best of the netherlands , is really not that good at all internationally . 
  even when it 's in a swimming pool or indoor court ? 
  hockey not on ice or underwater . 
  you can play it on a grass field , an indoor court , but it 's usually played on artificial turf . 
  it 's played here and there , but it 's a very niche sport . 
  the best team in the dutch league ( tilburg trappers ) won too much so they started to participate in the ** third ** german league . 
  ice hockey 's low popularity is interesting because regular hockey and speed skating are both popular here . 
  speed skating is sometimes even considered our national sport . 
  you 'd think that the sport that combines the two would do better . 
  quarter pounder is used , but here it refers to the metric pound ( = 500 grams ) . 
  we also use metric ounces ( = 100 grams ) in the netherlands sometimes , but both are n't very common . 
  they are really just leftover words from the old dutch measurement system that were redefined when the metric system was introduced in 1816 . 
  there are some things which are still measured in inches , like computer screen sizes and car rim diameters , but they 're rare and some people might not even know that there 's an actual unit behind them . 
  feet and inches are never used together , and i ca n't think of anywhere where an imperial pound or stone is used . 
  [ beer ] ( https://i.redd.it/tnsl3mmwif4z.png ) is the only one i could think of for the netherlands , but looking around apparently there 's also a sort-of rivalry betwen volkswagen ( northeast ) and opel ( southwest ) for [ the most popular car brand ] ( https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/buurtfacts/verkeer/volkswagen-opel-peugeot-het-populairste-automerk-gemeente ) . 
  not really , though it 's of course subjective . 
  there is one case in recent memory . 
  in 2015 mitch henriquez died as a result of his arrest . 
  the arrest was justified , but 2 of the 5 officers involved are suspected of having used too much violence during the arrest and have to go to court for that . 
  we also got the square mortarboards . 
  and apart from that we wear more formal clothing than usual , but not necessarily suits and gowns here . 
  business casual is also common . 
  dominican republic would be another , but i agree it 's weird . 
  if there 's a better and shorter alternative , why not use it . 
  volkswagen currently . 
  vw touran and vw transporter are the main models . 
  the next generation has been ordered with mercedes and the models will be mostly b-class and vito, 
  a small village is called [ nederland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nederland,_overijssel ) , the same name as the country in dutch . 
  not really an institution , but there 's also the festival [ lowlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lowlands_\\ ( festival \\ ) ) , which can mean netherlands or low countries . 
  there are also several streets named nederlandstraat ( netherlands street ) , in neighborhoods where the streets have a country theme . 
  4 may is our remembrance day . 
  there are ceremonies in many places , and at 20:00 two minutes of silence is held throughout the country . 
  all tv and radio channels go silent , [ trains stop running ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihhyl8j7ce ) , [ planes stop taxiing and are n't allowed to take off or land at airports ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeyki-wzome ) , people park their cars or bikes on the side of the road ( [ as do food delivery people ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/699kex/all_of_the_netherlands_was_silent_for_2_minutes/ ) ) . 
  not specifically for veterans though , it 's for all victims of war . 
  we also have a veterans day the last saturday of june , there are a bunch of ceremonies , but i do n't think most people care much about that or would know what day it is . 
  i 've seen that in prague too . 
  my impression is that it 's a thing for small/cheap apartments , in a lot of countries . 
    i dislike the custom that you 're supposed to refuse a gift or invitation to be polite  do we do this ? 
  really ? 
  i am not aware of it ? 
  hahah well , now that you mention it , it is possibly that we say something like `` it is not necessary '' or `` you do n't need to worry '' or whatever ? 
  hahaha !, 
  is it that ? 
  well that 's it , but maybe it 's stronger/worse in andalusia where i was , or maybe people just liked to exaggerate this custom for the foreigner . 
  what would you say when someone asked you to stay for dinner ? 
  that 's where i noticed it most . 
  i dislike the custom that you 're supposed to refuse a gift or invitation to be polite , and that the offering party must offer it again to show that they were genuinely offering , going back and forth a few times . 
  it means it gets weird when you genuinely refuse ( they think you 're playing the game ) , and of course people not aware of this custom ( like me , at first ) will not offer it again also leading to awkward situations . 
  dutch directness is just clearer and faster for everyone . 
  also , new year 's eve in spain was very underwhelming to me . 
  it 's one of my favourite holidays in the netherlands , with a lot of fireworks , shooting with calcium carbide , comedians looking back on the year and tasty food and drinks . 
  in spain they eat 12 grapes at the 12 bell strikes at midnight and that 's about it . 
  on the other hand , i really like the passion for el cl\u00e1sico !, 
  edit : and your reyes magos story makes way more sense to me than the american santa claus !, 
  i ca n't speak for the germans , but in my experience dutch people agree that dutch is a harsh language . 
  we make jokes about our g/ch sound all the time , try to teach words with that sound to tourists , etc. 
  in this [ recent spanking thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6defa9/were_you_spanked_as_a_child_if_you_misbehaved/ ) a lot of people mentioned their birth year . 
  1980s and 1990s are definitely very well represented here , but exceptions to earlier decades are n't rare either , but i see almost nobody from the 2000s . 
  with that in mind i would estimate the average age to be in the high 20s . 
  never, 
  estland is how we call your country in dutch !, 
  * which is much less catchy in english , it means * well-behaved dog !, 
  around 0:14 lena is saying `` is it a girl ? '', 
  in german and `` boobs ? '', 
  in sign language . 
  i do n't see the judges talking at other moments . 
  bicycle . 
  very satisfied . 
  that 's in the same province ( brabant ) as the two trashy towns i named and the [ tv series you 're referring to ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_kids ) that takes place there is based on the stereotypical bottom-of-the-barrel-brabander . 
  oude pekela is the poorest town in the netherlands . 
  helmond has a reputation for being trashy . 
  rucphen is also quite trashy . 
  i did n't want to spend hours finding the best example . 
  you can see most members of parliament are n't actually participating in the knocking in this case . 
  it 's done in the parliament of the netherlands as well ( [ example ] ( https://youtu.be/j_jkt6yn2si?t=118 ) ) . 
  i have n't seen it anywhere else , though . 
  german efficiency ? 
  applauding with one hand , taking notes with the other ? 
  plenty . 
  most popular are ones about the traffic police . 
  the most famous one is * blik op de weg * ( a pun meaning both `` a look at the road '' and `` metal on the road '' ) . 
  it ran from 1991 to 2015 , all the episodes are now [ on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plufvdogzaz2mejisc02ddfyl9_sd8wdf6 ) . 
  others that i can think of are/were * wegmisbruikers * ( `` abusers of the road '' ) , * op de bon * ( an expression meaning `` fined '' ) , * unit luchtvaartpolitie * ( `` unit aviation police '' ) , * de politiehelikopter * ( `` the police helicopter '' ) , * de meldkamer * ( `` the dispatch center '' ) . 
  on the low budget channels you 'll also see shows which collect clips from these foreign shows ( mostly uk , i think ) and add dutch commentary . 
  in the last few years police departments have taken it upon themselves to film their work with dashcams and bodycams and put videos on youtube . 
  you 'll find many of these on / r/hulpdiensten . 
  how dare you !,
