  drenthe does n't even have proper cities . 
  so how can they be ugly ?

  ( [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/4mc64t/toponymy_common_suffixes_in_dutch_place_names_oc/ ) ), 
  the name [ van gogh ] ( https://forvo.com/word/vincent_van_gogh/ ) is also butchered by most people from outside the netherlands, 
  peter sagan , he brings a lot of entertainment to bicycle racing and not just by being very fast . 
  things like what ? 
  you 're worried you wo n't be issued your renewed passport * within a month * ? 
  how long does it usually take in belgium ? 
  does each of your governments have to sign it separately ? 
  is your infrastructure really so terrible that it has to be delivered on foot ? 
  anyway , you would probably have to apply for an emergency passport . 
  you 're right , i did n't know that . 
  still , my objection to eating it would n't be about the animal , but the method of slaughtering . 
  i 'm sure it 's possible to slaughter dogs without torturing them , like we do with most animals , in which case i would n't be opposed to eating the meat . 
  yep , only in brussels do they use both languages . 
  i think international trains have different rules , they seem to always speak both and usually also english and german . 
  monday . 
  that 's also [ the iso standard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_week_date ) . 
  i 've never eaten it , it 's just not available . 
  many people do n't like eating `` pets '' . 
  i personally would n't be opposed to eating it , though . 
  which is actually owned for 50 % by shell . 
  in my province ( limburg ) it 's [ apparently ] ( https://www.wml.nl/nl-nl/158/5905/waterproductie.aspx ) 3/4 ground water and 1/4 surface water from the river meuse . 
  the ground water is mostly naturally filtered , but an additional filtering process is performed , including a step to reduce the chalk content . 
  the surface water undergoes a more extensive filtering process . 
  it 's difficult to say which of the first three is most common , they 're all used quite regularly . 
  in written or formal language it 's definitely verenigd koninkrijk , and i guess groot-britanni\u00eb would be the most common in daily speech . 
  the abbreviations are less used , but you hear them too . 
  in the last 2 summer olympics hockey was the most watched sport . 
  swimming is usually also very popular . 
  gymnastics did very well last year ( 2nd most watched ) with a promising candidate . 
  in the winter olympics there 's no doubt ( long track ) speed skating is the most popular . 
  it 's sometimes considered the national sport of the netherlands and 95 % of dutch medals in the winter olympics are from speed skating . 
  newly formed eu institutions are already being based further east , like [ berec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/body_of_european_regulators_of_electronic_communications ) in latvia , [ acer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agency_for_the_cooperation_of_energy_regulators ) in slovenia , [ frontex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frontex ) in poland and [ eit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_institute_of_innovation_and_technology ) in hungary . 
  * moving * institutions probably is n't very efficient and therefore not common , but with the brexit coming up some institutions in london will have to move so maybe romania gets lucky this time . 
  otherwise i 'm sure it 'll get some other institution someday . 
  so apparently it 's because that number only includes peanut butter from the us . 
  peanut butter is very popular in several european countries , but we generally do n't import the overly sweetened kind from the us . 
  around 15 degrees here , feels cold after we had a few warmer days last week but it 's nothing extraordinary . 
  does it count as an `` experience '' if you 've been in an earthquake but did n't notice anything at the time ? 
  i just checked the [ register ] ( https://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/seismologie/aardbevingen ) once and found that i was in a town at the time of a very weak earthquake there . 
  * uitmaken * , literally * making out * , but really more like * turning off * . 
  also just * uit elkaar gaan * , like * splitting up * . 
  trying alcohol at quite a young age , i do n't know exactly when . 
  maybe around 6 or 7 years old , but just sips . 
  at 15 i drank my first own bottle of beer . 
  first time that i was drunk was at 17 . 
  ( drinking age for low alcoholic drinks like beer and wine was 16 in the nl at the time , it has since been changed to 18 for all alcohol ), 
  yeah user editing was enabled for a short time , but it was disabled again . 
  it of course has the advantage that people can say they 're from multiple countries or specify what region they 're from without us having to add a lot of flags for all the regions in europe . 
  but it can also reduce clarity if people put jokes there or say their ( obscure ) region without their country , which can be a problem because the flags are n't visible on mobile versions of reddit . 
  since knowing where someone is from is pretty essential for this subreddit , and not every desktop user might realize the flags are n't visible on mobile , we decided to disable it . 
  midden-oosten ( middle east ) nabije oosten ( near east ) exists but the name is no longer in use ( as opposed to verre oosten ( far east ) , which has become uncommon but is still in use ) . 
  voor-azi\u00eb ( fore-asia ) is another historic name . 
  / u/visvis made [ this map ] ( https://gfycat.com/welcomecraftyastrangiacoral ) last year showing the distance to an open supermarket in the netherlands each hour of the week . 
  it 's only the two biggest supermarket chains , but i think it paints a pretty good picture . 
  ( you can pause and move through the week by hand at the bottom of the page ) . 
  from it i conclude that most locations open at 8 and close at 20 or 21 . 
  there are stores open earlier and later , but between midnight and 5 none of them are open . 
  some small stores ( like belonging to gas stations ) do remain open during the night , but i think it 's pretty rare . 
  24/7 has become a little more common in recent years , some larger cities are experimenting with it , but from what i can see it 's not very popular so far . 
  restaurants are often open for longer , especially those for fast food . 
  bars can also stay open to well into the night , and i think a few 24/7 bars exist too but i 'm not sure . 
  no majors either , and for the degrees/courses it depends a lot on how you measure it , categories or specific courses , but i think the broad categories give the best picture . 
  here 's the top 10 categories ( by 1st year students in 2014-2015 , [ cbs ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?vw=t&amp;dm=slnl&amp;pa=70961ned&amp;d1=0&amp;d2=a&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=0-1&amp;d5=0&amp;d6=0&amp;d7=0&amp;d8=\\ ( l-15 \\ ) - l & hd = 160216-1216 & hdr = t , g6 , g5 , g4 , g2 , g1 , g3 & stb = g7 ) ) . 
  1 . business administration 2 . 
  healthcare 3 . 
  teaching 4 . 
  social sciences 5 . 
  technology 6 . 
  social work 7 . 
  computer sciences 8 . 
  law 9 . 
  art 10 . 
  architecture, 
  i think because `` we '' are speaking about our own countries , or the european union and its predecessors . 
  i doubt anyone is claiming that there have n't been any wars in the last 70 years . 
  vrijbuiter , where freebooter also comes from . 
  but this one took a detour via french ( flibustier ) and then spanish ( filibustero ) . 
  use the convenient red footpaths throughout the country !, 
  come on , [ italmostneverrains.nl ] ( https://www.hetregentbijnanooit.nl/site/it-almost-never-rains-in-english/ ), 
  where in europe is that not the case ? 
  it 's a weird combination of legality , illegality and decriminalization . 
  medical weed is always legal but for recreational weed : * legal : consumption * decriminalized : possession , growing for personal use , selling to consumers ( 18 + ) in coffeeshops * illegal : growing for commercial use , selling to coffeeshops , selling outside of a coffeeshop , selling to minors there 's a proposal on the table to decriminalize growing for commercial use and selling to coffeeshops , which seems able to get a majority . 
  several parties are in favor of legalizing that and everything under decriminalized , but not a majority . 
  how is the general opinion about it ? 
  here in the netherlands it comes up every now and then , but we actually seem to be moving away from it now . 
  for example , during our last election polling stations were forbidden from using computers that are connected to the internet during their ( manual ) counting of the ( paper ) ballots , because of the risk of hacking . 
  there was even talk of forbidding computers and calculators altogether so the counters would have to use pen and paper to add up all the votes together . 
  cycle from the north to the south of the country on segregated bicycle paths . 
  also , report them with the report button that you find under posts and comments . 
  there 's an active mod team now and trolling or any other participation in bad faith is against our rules . 
  people from a lot of countries say this about themselves though . 
  i do n't think it 's a particular thing for any country . 
  oh i see my phrasing was a bit ambiguous . 
  i did n't mean that as a generalized statement for the whole eurozone , but rather as a statement for my bank/my country that transfers to the rest of the eurozone are free . 
  transfers up to $ 50 000 to countries within the eurozone are free . 
  other sepa countries get a currency conversion fee .
