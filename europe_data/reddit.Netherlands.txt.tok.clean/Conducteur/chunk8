  not popular at all . 
  i think all of these are only in the news once a year , for some big final or the winner of the league ( the superbowl and similar ) , and maybe an article every now and then if something special happens . 
  baseball is very well known as a sport here , almost everyone plays it in pe , and we do quite well in international events , even won the world cup a few years ago . 
  it 's just not popular to watch , and definitely not foreign leagues . 
  basketball is also very well known , and it 's more popular . 
  the dutch league does get some attention , but that 's about it . 
  ice hockey is known but we prefer regular hockey . 
  it might be surprising because we also like ice skating as a nation . 
  but ice hockey has a bit of a reputation of being more like ice boxing with all the fights . 
  dutch teams will get some attention every now and then though . 
  american football is not played or broadcast here , and apart from the super bowl you 'll rarely hear anything about it . 
  average knowledge about the rules goes about as far as `` it 's like rugby but with body protection '' . 
  fun fact ( that you probably know , but most foreigners will not ) : a few months ago it was voted the 232nd best song of all time by dutch voters ( in a yearly tradition , with a radio broadcast of the entire top 2000 best songs . 
  that takes over a week , finishing at midnight on new year 's eve with ~ ~ queen 's bohemian rhapsody ~ ~ whichever song was voted # 1 that year ) . 
   best european hockey player woah woah woah , the dutch and germans have got you beat there . 
  there has never even been a single czech player nominated for hockeyer of the year : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fih_player_of_the_year_awards#winners, 
  thanks to the enschede treaty the dutch and german police cooperate very well . 
  police from both countries regularly exchange information , and have special permissions in each other 's territories . 
  there are also patrol cars with one german police officer and one dutch police officer around the border . 
  but even before the european union was a thing , things like this happened and were dealt with . 
  check out [ this 1996 police chase ] ( https://youtu.be/5n9t3anjdta?t=273 ) , the chased car illegally crosses the border into germany because they were unable to set up roadblocks in time , but the dutch police just continues following the car , while they 're in contact with the german police . 
  i do n't know how the cooperation with the belgian police is , but i assume it 's similar because it should be even easier to cooperate without the language being an issue . 
  i think everyone knows [ 15 miljoen mensen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8b_et-rfym ) . 
  it describes the dutch ( though the population has since grown to over * 17 million people * ) . 
  the video i linked has a decent english translation . 
  in my region also everybody knows and sings along to [ op fietse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1byraihts0 ) , about a cycle trip through the region . 
  the song is known in the rest of the netherlands but they do n't really understand the lyrics ( in the low saxon dialect ) . 
  [ here 's one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mn6exj5.jpg ) but i feel like the fad has mostly passed . 
  i did n't see anything for the uk two weeks ago either ( though i admit that flag would be too complicated for most buildings anyway , maybe the flag of england then ? ), 
  not in the netherlands . 
  amsterdams is a separate dialect with a lot of influences from yiddish . 
  for a long time the city of haarlem was said to have the dialect closest to standard dutch , but more recent research shows that the northeastern parts of flevoland are now even closer . 
  flevoland is that province in the middle of the country , of 99 % artificial land , so people from all over the netherlands moved there after it was built . 
  they probably mostly spoke standard dutch to each other to be understood , and i guess there has n't been a lot of time to develop a separate dialect , or at least it 's not very different from standard dutch yet . 
  the southwestern parts of flevoland have close ties and close proximity to amsterdam so they basically speak amsterdams as well . 
  from the kung fu moves he used to overpower the mods here i 'm pretty sure he has some years left .

  24 % on average for radio stations in the netherlands . 
  that includes a few radio stations which play only dutch music though ( it 's basically a genre ) , and most radio stations play much less . 
  for national radio stations excluding the dutch-only ones the average is 4.6 % . 
  for regional radio stations that 's 13.5 % .

  i wonder how that works for instrumental tracks or bilingual songs ( like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibxly2k2qti ) which is roughly 50-50 french-english , but you could even argue that that one lady gaga song with a few sentences in french is bilingual ) .

  you 're probably confused because the title `` minister-president '' has only existed since 1945 . 
  however , that 's just the name , the post has existed since 1848 but the prime ministers were called `` voorzitter van de ministerraad '' ( head of the cabinet ) . 
  the more informal `` premier '' also existed back then , and of course still exists now . 
  voting closes wednesday at 21:00 , first exit poll is usually released immediately and an improved one about half an hour later . 
  counting votes also starts immediately . 
  there 's usually a race between the smallest municipalities to be the first with the results , which start rolling in sometimes even before the second exit poll . 
  however , larger cities will come later and i would estimate you 'd need to wait until 2:00 or 3:00 to get a real idea of the results with figures like 90 + % counted . 
  regarding resources , in / r/thenetherlands we 'll post a link to a live interactive map where the results come in around 21:00 ( right now the link is unknown ) . 
  that map is in dutch but if you know the parties it should be understandable . 
  i 'm sure there will be threads in / r/europe following the result as well , maybe with tools more suited for non-dutch speakers .

  in cities and/or during rush hour there are just too many people for it ; the driver is busy then and even if he looked he would barely notice a wave from one person . 
  i do n't find it excessive to have many different types to choose from , neither spreads nor cheese .
