  the tax pressure as a result , seeing as we barely have any natural resources to finance this all , will make most of us extremely uncompetitive . 
  the fact that europe is lagging behind the rest of the world on technology and development will strengthen that dynamic . 
  this will lead to a large scale brain drain to better parts of the world . 
  we also do n't have the population to become a low-income industry for the world . 
  we 'll probably become more of an agricultural society that lives on tourism from asia . 
  as europe keeps declining economically , financially , demographically and politically , it will loose what little there 's left of international influence . 
  this might cause shifts in spheres , maybe russia will march further into europe , maybe china will take a large part of europe , maybe the us will loose much of its interest in an irrelevant europe . 
  seeing as the eu as a whole will be the 3th economy in the world in a year or two this is all not that far away , but maybe some us will manage to remove ourselves from the ez and eu , we 'll see what the future exactly holds .

  no we wo n't keep up , we 've been kept down by the ez for years , and that 's not likely to disappear any time soon . 
  europe is also pretty much a gone era with little future , so there are n't a lot of opportunities in the region . 
  yes we are , and the differences will only increase the coming years . 
  of course it 's our fault , we let them in with their backwards ideology . 
  ironically , it 's ` deeply concerning ' people think like this . 
  only 1 million a year ? 
  why not 10 million while we 're at it . 
  germany seems an awful lot concerned lately . 
  if only they did something with those concerns , perhaps that would prevent others from doing something instead . 
  forgot about dutch , we 're on the same path as britain . 
  if all else fails , emigrate . 
  then join the resistance against the future islamic state . 
  pick the strongest side when the fights break out . 
  it will reach 1:1 perhaps even below that , in a while . 
  no , we still wo n't be allowed to send anyone back , and we will still be facing the illegal entrants in their hundred thousands . 
  watching is all we do , hoping it wo n't bring too much trouble when there are millions of illegals in europe in a few years . 
  there 's no need . 
  convert to islam and you 'll be safe . 
  ah yes good one . 
  but there are still a dozen others . 
  doubt it . 
  we do n't seem to be able to do a lot well lately . 
   the time spent with a politician should be independently allocated and transparently announced on that basis . 
  there where plans of the current commission to make all lobbies transparent ( public ) . 
   ukraine is neither in nato nor eu . 
  there is no obligation to do anything at all then you 're mistaken . 
  but you 're right , we have forsaken the european project before , we do n't really care that much for peace in europe .

  what a great and kind idea . 
   the biggest obstacle is cuban americans . 
  they are staunchly against normalizing relations and are a strong voting bloc , especially in florida . 
  do they really hate cuba that much then ? 
   it seems cuba has been open to mending relations with the us , but i think that amount of debt forgiveness was too much to pass up for them . 
  how large where these debts ? 
   despite recent developments with russia the us seems to be continuing to ease restrictions . 
  let 's see if it continues . 
  well i gues the best way to keep russia out of cuba is to work together with them . 
  maybe the cubans rather choose to improve relations with the us , as they seem to be doing currently . 
  i heard in the news this morning . 
  quite a sensible plan , it can be done on a secretfully small scale to pretend it 's very large scale and it might cause general fear of tax evasion . 
  the idea of `` anyone could be undercover '' would indeed probably have a impact . 
   well , you need to look from perspective . 
  this is how growing economy looks . 
  past growth wo n't yield us anything . 
   also , according to imf , russian gdp ( ppp ) is world 's 6th and is $ 3,491 billions while germany 's is $ 3,512 . 
  so our economy is not so small after all . 
  yet it 's stil economically irrelevant for us besides some gas and oil , maybe the wood and aluminium , things that require as less labour and manufacturing as possible . 
  it should be food for thought when you know czech republic is a larger trade partner than russia . 
  russia 's largest export partner in the world is the netherlands , and you guys sure fucked that relation up . 
  did n't know that , thanks for adding . 
  if you say so . 
  france is also actively hacking the us among others . 
  germany has also been tapping us politicians ( they had a tap on john kerry among others ) the rest is n't as sacred as the pope either . 
  it 's just that the us had a wistleblower . 
   nsa is not made of high school students . 
  neither are european companies and governments . 
   routing traffic through switzerland and netherlands does n't make any difference for them . 
  it makes all the difference . 
   and it 's position was already undermined by nsa . 
  the us has it 's own servers , european traffic goes through switserland and the netherlands to avoid the nsa . 
  [ depends ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/russia-gdp-growth.png?s=rudprqoq&amp;d1=20140101&amp;d2=20151231 ) on your definition of growth . 
  growth is also not exactly expected in 2015 , rather a decline . 
  interestingly , even the czech republic is [ a larger trade partner ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/nationaleconomyenvironment/foreigntrade/tradingpartners/tables/orderrankgermanytradingpartners.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) than russia . 
  both poland and the uk have nothing to say about swift so , it 's really just undermining a commercial company its reliability and continuity , making sure countries like china and india will try to find an alternative to swift in the future . 
  i know , i was joking on the wehrmacht and reichswehr . 
  both sound a lot tougher than ` bundeswehr ' though . 
   economically russia and europe is more connected than europe and the us . 
  [ largest trading partners of the european union  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_european_union ) * 1 united states 444,799.0 * 2 china 428,351.9 * 3 russia 306,776.6 * 4 switzerland 212,876.9, 
   and a big market . 
  the size of italy . 
  do you know that belgium is a larger trade partner of germany than russia ? 
  we ca n't be sure , best be careful , maybe it has rabies . 
  they had enough ammunition , they ran out of precision guided bombes . 
  they could still bomb the living hell out of them , but that would have been very bloody . 
  a few weeks ago the german wehrmacht put a broom on a boxer panzerkampfwagen and painted it black during an exercise , because there where n't any real machine guns to use . 
   it 's not a matter of luck . 
  ooh it is , because previous attempts at `` stabalizing a region '' after bombing away the government have n't been a great succes ( iraq , afghanistan ) and that was with a country that has a multitude of the military , economical , intelligence , technological and financial power of italy . 
  so yea , you 'll need luck for that . 
  because you can bring 100.000 troops into libya if italy could actually sustain that , and still not achieve a damn thing in years . 
  good luck with that . 
  as if that will hold you back from eliminating a threat in libya . 
  has egypt asked for permission of the unsc when they bombed positions in libya a week or two ago ? 
  no they did n't .
