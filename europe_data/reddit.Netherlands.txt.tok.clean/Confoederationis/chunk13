  the royal netherlands navy , with its small force of extremely quiet diesel submarines , has made the u.s. navy eat the proverbial slice of humble pie on more than one occasion . 
  in 1989 , naval analyst norman polmar wrote in naval forces that during nato s exercise northern star , the dutch submarine zwaardvis was the only orange ( enemy ) submarine to successfully stalk and sink a blue ( allied ) aircraft carrier ten years later there were reports that the dutch submarine walrus had been even more successful in the exercise jtfex/tmdi99 . 
   during this exercise the walrus penetrates the u.s. screen and sinks many ships , including the u.s. aircraft carrier theodore roosevelt cvn-71 . 
  the submarine launches two attacks and manages to sneak away . 
  to celebrate the sinking the crew designed a special t - shirt . 
  fittingly , the t-shirt depicted the uss theodore roosevelt impaled on the tusks of a walrus . 
  it was also reported that the walrus also sank many of the roosevelt 's escorts , including the nuclear submarine uss boise , a cruiser , several destroyers and frigates , plus the command ship uss mount whitney . 
  the walrus herself survived the exercise with no damage . 
   not to be outdone by the canadians and dutch , the australian submarine force has also scored many goals against u.s. navy carriers and nuclear submarines . 
  on september 24 2003 , the australian newspaper the age disclosed that australia 's collins class diesel submarines had taught the u.s. navy a few lessons during multinational exercises . 
  by the end of the exercises , australian submarines had destroyed two u.s. navy nuclear attack submarines and an aircraft carrier . 
  according to the article : the americans were wide-eyed , commodore deeks ( commander of the ran submarine group ) said . 
  they realized that another navies knows how to operate submarines . 
  they were quite impressed . 
  it 's the same aircraft carrier . 
  the french are just a little bit late to catch a victory . 
  those who are refused at these offices and embassies will make the illegal journey anyway , the majority wo n't even bother and board the vessels for the illegal journey , and the few that do the legal way will make little difference . 
  the only way is to provide a legal way , and kick all others back over the pond . 
  everything short of that is a waste of time and effort because they 'll keep coming anyway , and the problems just keep growing . 
   i say organise direct democratic elections for the senate - that would politicize it too much , i do n't think it 's really the goal of the first chamber to be a sort of second parliament . 
  they look at the technicalities of the law , not so much at the ideology . 
  and they will if they 're elected . 
  and that 's why i vote local . 
  run outside and bring my bicycle inside , lock it up good , sprint to the hague and hope i can still catch the kings ' plane to london along with the cabinet . 
  europe isn ; t self sufficient . 
  we are dependent on trade , we have far too much people in this continent not to . 
   ( for one example we 'd be well into libyan national territory in order to dock that boat ) . 
  i 'm glad our armies did n't trespass then . 
  we could shoot down the libyan army and what more without concerning ourselves , and now we 're going to whine about the coast guard ? 
  if we can somehow fight a war in libya we can also drop these illegal entrants whereever we please . 
  ( the current problem would n't even be half as big as it is had they not bombed libya )  that would definitely be illegal their entrance was illegal to begin with , so then we 're all illegal . 
  nothing . 
  libya ca n't refuse anything , we leave the boat at the beach and call it a day . 
  they are secret about the negotiations with japan too . 
  that will also include an isds clause , as do probably all the fta 's we currently have . 
  never heard anyone complain about japan . 
  heard a thing or two about ceta , but only when ttip became popular and people started grouping them . 
  have you seen the treaty with new zealand ? 
  pretty secretive too . 
  and what about south korea ? 
   because it is n't necessarily the role of the state they 're leaving from to accept them back . 
  do n't care . 
  i was talking about solutions , not the average `` let 's do nothing because . . '' narrative . 
  ooh well , it 's not the last time the ttip will come by here . 
  some of us . 
  but we must trade in the future too . 
  if we pass on ttip , a chinese deal will be pushed on us which we can only sign and not debate at all . 
  in the course of this year , or the next , the eu as a whole will be the third economy of the world . 
  the difference will only grow as china and the us leap past us . 
  not being a part of the future global economic framework is an existential threat if you 're economically becoming irrelevant , and already are irrelevant in everything else . 
  ttip allows us to form the trade of the future . 
  if we do n't do that , then others will . 
   and do you realize that if a nato member was attacked germany including myself will be out there , too and defend that country like it was my own ? 
  ever heard of nato ? 
  the only problem is that germany has no army that can fight a war , and most probably berlin will be `` very deeply \u00fcber concerned '' and offer an fta if putin stops at slovakia or something . 
   but also the treaty itself will shift power from national parliaments to corporations , mainly by these secret courts . 
  europe already has hundreds of isds clauses , by far the most isds cases are done by european multinationals , europe has also been the driving force behind isds , it 's a german invention after all . 
  the continent that stands most to gain from isds is europe . 
   its time to organise demonstrations and demand an open , democratic discussion about what we want in such a treaty and what not . 
  yeah , let me tell it to you like this . 
  europe is a failed circlejerk . 
  it 's a continent that functions as a semi-colony completely dependent on another , we can not even form an immigration policy , let alone a foreign policy , we 're economically declining , financally half bankrupt , demographically declining , lagging behind in technology and science , we are internationally the laughing stock , we do n't have a military and lack any influence . 
  trade is the last thing europe could actually do , which is a miracle , the last thing short of being a complete mongoloid . 
  yet that is what we stand to loose , ttip is the one and only chance to stay relevant in the global economy . 
  otherwise we 'll loose that too , and with that our last influence . 
  how did it come to this . 
  what formed this public circlejerk ? 
  the last thing europe could actually do - trade - and we 're steering towards the destruction of it . 
  it 's a half attempt , better than nothing , to describe it optimisticly i gues . 
  the solution should be more simple . 
  provide a legal way to immigrate to europe for legit refugees . 
  set up offices , arange boats . 
  kick every and all illegal entrant back over the pond . 
  and it 's solved in a year or 1,5 . 
  now distribute all these refugees that we bring from north africa to europe fairly over all memberstates on some formula including km ^ 2 and population , and we 're all happy . 
   european commission wants to use ** offices and embassies ** outside eu ** to process applications ** for asylum and refugee status ** before migrants reach europe . 
  ** this will not solve anything . 
  it only provides a legal way to immigrate , the rest will still come illegally , we will still not send them back . 
  in france now . 
  aruba , curacao and bonaire are just a few miles of the venezuelan coast . 
  and they occasionally boast their fleet , allthough much less than decades ago . 
  last time was last year . 
  there 's a marine battalion , and a patriot airdefence unit ( 6-patriots ) , as well as a stationship ( usually a holland class ) but our navy is much stronger than venezuela , and we also have littoral capabilities , so currently they would n't burn their fingers on these islands . 
  but i would n't test fate , it happened to the falklands too . 
  and an eu military sounds like a `` deeply concerned '' one to me if they attack . 
  / u/savannajeff there 's work to do . 
  not in a federal state either ? 
  a federal government could easily be formed . 
  over time it could then always be geared towards a unitary state if that 's what both parties want . 
  it means that as he says , federal institutions must be bilingual . 
  so frog-eaters will have to adapt to that , just as all the others . 
  or better yet , wallonia joins france and ends the unhappy marriage . 
  so is dutch . 
  which means belgium is a bilingual country . 
  was n't commenting on that , it 's just a nice plane to see . 
   definitely good news . 
  it makes no sense to have such small independent militiaries . 
  it is good to see eastern eu countries beginning to do this as well . 
  well we should have no problem hosting a respectible navy , and we should . 
  if they finally find a replacement for the last m-frigates , and upgrade the holland class opv 's .
