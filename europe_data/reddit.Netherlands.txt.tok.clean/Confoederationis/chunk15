  we should become a lot more independent again , other countries will also respect us a lot more if we do . 
  crap , that math did n't work out at all . 
  some thoughts mixed while typing i gues . 
  the budget surplus of the german government is 18 billion euro , defense spending only 32 billion euro . 
  spending that on defense would ~ ~ more than double your budget . ~ ~ * increase the budget with more than 50 % * . 
  that would make a huge difference . 
  ( it would also make you the largest defense spender in europe right away ), 
  that would be around 120 billion dollar , more than russia and italy combined . 
  that should be a good start . 
  this is just hilarious !, 
  germany asks the netherlands for a transport plane because it has non-ready , and that plane breaks down . 
  hahahaha !, 
  you where probably unfortunate enough to come across a c-130 that has n't been near a french unit . 
  normally the dutch do maintenance of their equipment with parts from french inventories ( parts are expensive you know ) . 
  well , if they are n't around , no maintenance . 
  en geen dank/keine danke , now if you do n't mind , we have some undelivered weapons to disperse at the landmacht . 
  well , if we ca n't bring them you know ... 
   failures in recent months including the breakdown of a transport plane shipping arms to iraq 's kurds . 
   while the plane was dutch , did they ... did they just break down one of our c-130 's ? 
  damnit germany , we only have 4 of these things . 
  well , 3 now apparently . 
  yes , western countries have donated uniforms , helmets and other non-lethal aid . 
   ehh ... if an engineer is building a weapons system , he ca n't be building a civilian system . 
  there are not only engineers , and the company pays taxes , the employees income taxes , they spend their income which again flows partially into taxes . 
  it also stimulates employment . 
  of every 1 billion euro spend by the government in a procurement of equipment domestically producted , around 60 % will flow right back into the government . 
  furthermore the research , progress and knowledge obtained may lead to future commercial advances , which brings more money . 
  of course there are costs , but far less than the gross procurement sum . 
  sometimes it may even yield profit . 
  as if it 's somehow surprising . 
   there 's no attempt at taking a global look at european space efforts , what efforts exactly ? 
  more cultural enrichment , could be expected . 
  euhm britain is thinking of cutting it 's nuclear arsenal . 
  and a french men just said france also wants to cut long range missile capability . 
  if putin waits a few years , he can invade and occupy us without much hassle . 
  we 're not really worth it to be defended by the us either , we are a declining continent , economically we 're starting to become irrelevant in the world , demographically we 're declining , we lagging behind in nearly everything in science and industry . 
  so i would n't be so sure the us is around for ever , and when they leave we have nothing anymore . 
  putin probably does n't mind some us soldiers in georgia . 
  did n't both sides just a few days ago withdraw their heavy weapons ? 
  maybe now is not the time to escalate ? 
  that depends on where we place the pole . 
  it 's nowhere near enough to stop an invasion , it 's useless against hybrid warfare , it can give a small rebel army a bad time . 
   there are innocent children oh no !, 
  not the children ?!, 
  [ there are ] ( http://i.guim.co.uk/media/w-1920/h--/q-95/fb6fb47eefeb2575e42be5c1aaae8a0dacb7bc1f/699_947_4298_2580/2000.jpg ) no children amongst them , not even women . 
  the majority are healthy young middle class men fleeing to europe for free money . 
  no women , no children . 
  you see the real people in need ( the women and children ) can not afford to reach europe . 
  well they are getting ( light ) tanks . 
  there 's currently a dutch mechanized battalion with 40 cv90 's in estonia that 's training with the estonian army , and in a few weeks they get these cv90 's . 
  that will increase their capability quite some . 
  there are currently also 8 eurofighters , 4 f16 's , and 4 mig 29 's from the italian , spanish , polish and belgian airforce . 
  how much would that be , 40.000 ? 
  50.000 troops ? 
  the russians have shown they can muster around 150.000 troops . 
  we are n't stopping that in the baltics . 
  oh ... we 're really doing away with it all . 
  they already have an eu presense . 
  britain loosing its nuclear deterrent also wo n't help me sleep at night , but if france does away with it i 'll be facing sleepless nights . 
  what 's the aerian vector ? 
  also too bad for the british industry . 
  i mean biddings like these barely cost a thing if your own industries builds them . 
  we 're having a somewhat related discussion , the hague wanted to do away with it 's submarine fleet if the current walrus class expires . 
  even more stupid , but i hope they wake up before it 's too late . 
  not renewing our submarine fleet will also cause damen to loose it 's ability to build submarines , so we would n't be able to build them ourselves anymore . 
  but this sounds so enormously stupid , that it 's almost certain they 'll do it . 
  that 's really worrying ... 
  ca n't agree more . 
  i think he means that the fsb itself would do it to get more funding from putin . 
  i agree , but they do n't return people . 
  a lot more people will come to europe , numbers will keep rising . 
  right now there are more people displaced than during ww2 , the chain is being pushed from the source ( conflict/instable ) zones and it 's like water , if it finds a way out it will move there and keep running as long as the tap does , and that way is italy . 
  yes . 
  though it 's hard to tell wether the disagreeing part is the problem , or the institutionalized gridlock that follows . 
  i mean the commission wanted an eu public prosecutor to fight corruption with eu funds ( hungary etc. ), 
  which the council blocked ( the council is an abomination of an institute that requires absolute majorities , qualified majorities and talks about single veto 's . ), 
  now the same with the roaming fee , a wish of the commission , past the ep , and now the council shoots it . 
  the problem is really that there 's no central decision making , so nothing complete , decisive , revolutionairy , progressive and good ever seems to roll out of brussels . 
  is the uk really going to cut it 's nuclear arsenal ? 
   the lowest-ranking cities ** in western europe ** are belfast ( 63 ) and ** athens ** ( 85 ) . 
  did cnn write this by any chance ? 
  they provide help to both italy and greece , memberstates only ca n't agree how to help . 
  triton is close to the coast , intended to * not * pick up immigrants far of the italian coast . 
  this way of working , picking up any boat everywhere whenever spotted , is only helping the people trafickers and create a bigger stream . 
  others will not help in creating that . 
  some stay and sell trinkets to tourists , some go to sweden for benefits , to germany for work , or to england and end up in a makeshift tent in calais . 
  to be honest , we let all these people in . 
  it ; s our own fault if it happens . 
  it 's funny how half of europe is on this list . 
   as banking is a trade ( like being a journalist etc ) . 
  banking is a trade until their losses from wind-trade are dropped on the populace . 
  then they get a societal responsibility that should , just like a laywer , be subjected to ethical codes of conduct . 
  how harsh and strict is debatable . 
  by the way , the dutch central bank has already extended its screening of bankers , and refuses more and more people to become a banker . 
  that 's a start , but i think a global or european wide framework is needed . 
   the people opposing gmo 's did , as could be expected . 
  even if so , they would n't need the scientific advisor on their side . 
  the eu 's food regulatory frame allows for banning of imports without scientific reason to do so . 
  either because it 's unclear if it 's safe , or even on the basis of public opinion , and cultural heritage . 
  i 'm 99 % certain somebody did this with malicious intends , that 's now going to buggle up the money into his regular budget to save some of his tax incomes .
