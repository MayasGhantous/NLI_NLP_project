  all things require choices though , and we should become independent quickly . 
   it 's not america that 's dividing russia and europe , and i do n't know what makes you say it is . 
  it 's most definitely russia that 's causing a division between russia and europe . 
  yes , but american interference can indeed cause a rift in europe . 
  if the us starts to act single handedly ( like handing out weapons to ukraine ) they 'll push us over . 
  the us needs to stand down and act passively in line with its western european allies , push them if needed , but not interfere single handedly in european matters . 
  this is our continent , we have to live here , they have to respect that . 
  people like / u/ididpotato do n't really care for what happens to the baltics . 
  this is why eastern europe is looking out for the us , they do not find the support they need in much of western/southern europe , and if something happens to the baltics they will all panic , pretend it 's a surprise , and at most send some diplomats to `` de-escalate '' and find a `` compromise '' . 
  a lot of the eu funds end up in the pockets of orban and the like . 
  there have been talks to set up a eu public prosecutor , but that 's being blocked by the council . 
  but they certainly need to change something there , otherwise we should lower those funds until they provide clarity . 
  yes . 
  it 's not about what 's practical . 
  the question is if you 're willing to share a union and cooperate with the rest of europe or not . 
  i do n't know , we could start with a eurozone vat rate . 
  that 's badly needed anyway considering the fraud and recent legislation putting administrative burden on sme 's . 
  we could start from there . 
  from vat to a european company tax rate , to a european social security scheme , etc. 
  could easily be completed in 10-20 years . 
  do you think they will vote for independence ? 
  [ oops ] ( https://anarchistdaily.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/capitalism-cartoonweb.jpg ) , i shall go into hiding now . 
  following the teachings of the trojka ? 
   if the greeks vote a particular way in their election but that vote has no impact on greeks then that is a failure of democracy . 
  no it is n't . 
   if rajoy refuses to give concessions to greece , because he is motivated by domestic concerns , that is very worrying for the eurozone . 
  no it is n't . 
   as much as we might like dijsselbloem , the greeks did not vote for him . 
  in fact , they just voted for policies which he objects too . 
  this is a failure of democracy . 
  and i did not vote for varoufakis or tsipras . 
  you understand what democracy means in a nation state , now lift that to a supranational entity . 
  we ca n't all have our ways . 
  [ not ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/switzerland-gdp-growth.png?s=szgdpcqq&amp;d1=20080101&amp;d2=20151231 ) that well either . 
  [ you ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/sweden-gdp-growth.png?s=swgdpaqq&amp;d1=20080101&amp;d2=20151231 ) want [ anymore ? ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/bulgaria-gdp-growth.png?s=bulgariagdpqoq&amp;d1=20080101&amp;d2=20151231 ) . 
  or [ is it ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/romania-gdp-growth.png?s=romaniagdpqoq&amp;d1=20080101&amp;d2=20151231 ) good enough so ? 
  sovereign currencies are seen as some holy grail present day , they are not . 
  obviously both have advantages , but things are n't that simple . 
  what did lithuania supply ? 
  [ excellent ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/denmark-gdp-growth.png?s=degdpnqq&amp;d1=20080101&amp;d2=20151231 ) point , a bit [ clearer ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/euro-area-gdp-growth.png?s=eugnemuq&amp;d1=20080101&amp;d2=20151231 ), 
   read my comment again . 
  i am obviously not saying that the only democracy that matters is the greek one . 
  you are talking about an axis that threatens democracy . 
  obviously that axis is democratic , represents a far larger electorate , so is no threat to democracy at all . 
   however , surely you must accept that one of the consequences of the euro , is that domestic governments have hugely limited their economic options ? 
  that 's not a consequence , that 's a choice to join a currency union . 
   yet voting structures for economic options still rest with national governments and this has worrying implications for democracy . 
  they rest with 19 ministers of finance . 
   what the eurozone must create is a single governement with a single finance minister . 
  that 's called the head of the eurozone , also known as dijsselbloem currently , that has been working his ass of shaping this . 
   denmark and switzerland with their own currencies will continue to outperform the eurozone . 
  they will not give them up . 
  [ does n't ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/denmark-gdp-growth.png?s=degdpnqq&amp;d1=20140101&amp;d2=20151231 ) seem like an [ astonishing ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/euro-area-gdp-growth.png?s=eugnemuq&amp;d1=20140101&amp;d2=20151231 ) outperformance . 
   for local domestic political reasons , of course the fact that portugal now borrows at lower rates than the us government has nothing to do with it . 
  it 's all political , they achieved nothing ? 
   this is extremely worrying for democracy . 
  of course , because greece is the only democracy in europe . 
  where do people get this narrative that only greece has elected representatives ? 
  the eurozone could have averted most of the eurocrisis in 2011-2012 if it had given insurances it would do everything it could do to keep the currency union in tact . 
  if it gives such insurances right away during a hypothetical grexit , portugal , ireland and italy would probably be safe . 
  but it seems impossible , eurozone government tried to dissolve the eurozone in 2012 , they just ca n't , it 's irreversible . 
  so greece wo n't leave either , even if it would default , it will stay in the eurozone . 
  saint-pierre and miquelon probably . 
  it misses bonaire , st. eustatius and saba . 
  culturally european is sufficient . 
  which would pretty much allow canada , new zealand and australia . 
  even the us ( :p ) . 
  if we could end the euro chapter it would have ended in 2012 . 
  the reality is the euro is irreversible . 
  so it will be here to stay , and it will progress . 
  the eu will be going through a tough time still , but it is n't going in that direction . 
  it will integrate step by step . 
  [ public opinion ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb82/eb82_first_en.pdf ) is improving too . 
  i read the report a while back , the writer has little clue about the situation in europe , and i find the author ( s ) is very biased , and the arguments he uses are more of a arm chair confirmation of what he wants to see than that they reflect the probable coming period . 
  anyway , it 's exactly as varoufakis put it , europe progresses from crisis to crisis , this is how we function . 
  we will have many crises to come , and we will leave each one as a stronger entity . 
  he adresses the attitude of the west and russia during the `` fall '' and shortly after the `` fall '' , of the ussr , until now . 
  he makes some comments on the `` personalising and moralising '' of current politics , both in the public but more importantly the government . 
  ( he makes reference to the congress among others ) . 
  he 's still very much thinking from a cold war perspective , something the world clearly left behind and hints that we may not have understood what we 're walking into . 
  it 's difficult to summarize , but i think he pretty well explains the russian point of view , it 's worth the watch . 
   my biggest complaint is the eu seems to think it is not supposed to be in a position to lead when military intervention is necessary . 
  that 's where the eu runs out of tools , and things are brought to national-politics again . 
  the eu works fine when things happen in the commission , things get complicated when they happen in the council . 
  and that 's where issues go when the eu runs out of tools . 
  the only military brussels have are several divisions intended as peace keepers made available by memberstates . 
  ( eurocorps etc. ), 
  the eu does n't have an army . 
   many on this sub will praise the diplomatic efforts of the eu when they worked ( which is obviously preferable ) , but completely ignore the times they failed . 
  taking a critical look at the failures and making a serious attempt at changing how those situations are handled would be beneficial in my opinion . 
  well both ways ( diplomacy-military ) have their succeses and failures , both have their advantages and disadvantages . 
  i agree with your point that we do need to intervene when the need is dire though . 
  i 've no idea what goes through the governments at these moments , but that is out of the league of the eu and completely memberstate business , so in essence france and the uk deeper beyond mena , and italy closer to home . 
  the uk is mostly present when the us is present , and france diverts most of it 's assets to its grasp on northern africa . 
  i think it 's foremost a material issue . 
  france has one carrier group , if it wants to strike in for example iraq , it will seriously need to divert assets , while the us has completely autonomous carrier groups in nearly every region of the world . 
  13 in total i think . 
  europe has 5 carrier groups , and around 10 autonomous blue water fleets , but there you go coupling several countries , which will yield no assertive response . 
  no problem at all . 
  it was indeed a bit confusing .
