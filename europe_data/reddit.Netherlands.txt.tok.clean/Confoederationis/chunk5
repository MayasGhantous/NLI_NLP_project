  some people follow a course up until their 50s , so that should n't be odd . 
  there are also evening courses , regular bachelor courses that are held in the evening for people who work during the day , and those will all be your age or even older . 
  there are also home education courses with videolinks etc. 
  so possibilities enough . 
  with a us bachelors degree you will be admitted to any bachelor course , or related master degree here . 
   although i do not think it was a conscious decision by russia . 
  i think russia probably just provided a bunch of untrained rebels with weapons they had no idea how to use . 
  i did n't want to say they did it on purpose , i expect it was an accident indeed . 
  though they should 've acted different right after , and assisted us instead of withholding us from reaching the crash site being afraid of the blame . 
   it seems like the public opinion of most dutch people is very non-interventionist with the exception of this situation with russia ( as a result of mh17 ) . 
  what is your take on that ? 
  the public opinion is not necessarily non-interventionalist , there 's however a strong opinion against actual wars and regime changes ( libya , iraq ) . 
  what my take on that is , is that the people leading those countries ( saddam , qudafi etc. ), 
  where total jerks , no doubt . 
  their countries ... not exactly a paradise . 
  however , a lot of these dictators serve or served our interests , we have no problem in cooperating with the most vile dictators if it yields something , and we should too . 
  so removing them is done not because of humanitarian concerns , or to bring freedom or democracy , or other moral pretences , no those are geo-political games . 
  that is the case with iraq , that is the case with libya . 
  so these interventions are done for a political goal , the result is that a nation is thrown into a larger abyss with a societal collapse , and we can say those countries ( libya , iraq ) have not exactly improved , so it was a wasted effort in humantarian or moral sense . 
  that 's where we are against . 
  we should work with the government a country has , use the influence we have as a force of good , but do n't draw the sword under a moral pretence for personal gain . 
  besides that we 're pretty supportive of international missions . 
  like atalanta in somalia , we have an intelligence operation in centr . 
  afr . 
  republic , an airforce operation to assist the french in mali , military trainers in iraq , we have trained police and military in iraq and afghanistan etc. 
  ( and recieved much praise for our work from the community ) people are supportive of that , not wars . 
  of course there where some factions complaining now and then about those missions , but that 's mostly about the costs . 
  you may now the term of going dutch in a restaurant :p , well that 's a cultural thing , `` ons bint zuunig '' . 
  ( we 're always on a budget , prefer a sober lifestyle , and sit on our moneyzz )  i have to say i am glad to see the dutch government taking the situation seriously . 
  it sucks it is at the expense of 300 of your countrymen ( and many others ) . 
  i certainly do not wish something similar happened to different eu countries , but i wish they would take this more seriously . 
  it seems like the uk is starting to but germany just reaffirmed romania did not need naval support because germany `` hoped '' the situation would not escalate there . 
  well even if he would go full lunatic , he would n't go after romania . 
  it seems many states are overreacting at this moment , and as mentioned by merkel , the solution to this conflict is n't military , and will not become military . 
   but , it should be capable of asserting eu interests . 
  the eu has chosen to assert its interests through soft powers and non-violent means . 
  strengthening the african union and un for example , giving funds for countries to increase their domestic security , giving funds to raise local un soldiers , or military intelligence missions like currently in car to assist low-tech armies in fighting , air support only missions like we do in mali , etc. 
  we 're trying to emphasize that the solution to regional conflicts lies in regional means , and we have choosen to support those with what they lack , and we have , to solve issues . 
   i think that if it pulled out of europe , it would also certainly spend less . 
  you would also no longer have a seat at the european table when it 's about regional ( mena-eur . ), 
  subjects , which will cost you significant influence around the world . 
  that 's the reason you 're still there , a lot of europe really would n't mind if the us left , it will also eliminate us foreign policy here which some memberstates ( germany among others ) would find welcome to increase their influence . 
  which sounds quite useless . 
  spanish is the second or third most spoken language in the world . 
  you already have a global language . 
  and a far more beautiful one at that . 
  i would support latin too . 
  200 years ago we fought a war over a primary language , which severed our territory . 
  we would do so again . 
  you do n't touch the language of a group , if it goes , it goes it 's natural course , that 's all that can and should be said about it . 
  our languages are a great historical heritage and part of our diversity , identity and culture . 
  ` muric\u00e1h , fuck yea !, 
  i 'm sure greek media is much better being full of swastika 's , nazi 's and ww2 references . 
  very unbiased , and to the point . 
  very intesting point of view , worth the watch . 
  we managed to give overseas territories a special legal stance in the eu , we could do the same for iceland too on the basis of fishery . 
  maybe not preferable , but as you say the other option is not a member at all . 
  it would be nice if iceland ( or even norway ) would join one day . 
  that depends on its implementation . 
  i 'm interested in a way to expel all refugees who are n't really refugees , so deport the economic immigrants . 
  i 'm interested in a way to solve the problem of accumulating illegals in places like calais , but all over europe too , either by arresting them and dispersing them through the legal channels , or deportation . 
  beyond that i 'm interested to disperse all * real * refugees among all eu memberstates based on some formula involving seize and population of each state . 
  give them a temporary residence permit so they ca n't travel after being placed somewhere for a few years . 
  we 've taken in far too much , we have no idea how to integrate them , and indeed a significant part is n't integrating at all . 
  the least we could do is allow no more , it 's enough as it is . 
  and then perhaps find way to live with those who already entered . 
  if everybody would just make their own piece of land on this earth livable , the situation would be even better than that . 
  i gues it really depends how they will handle rising sentiments like the call for democracy in hong kong . 
  if reliable partners to you means `` doing everything we want '' then no . 
  if reliable partners means doing everything in its power to prevent escalation , and uphold the rule of law , then it is reliable . 
  they knew it would come to pass in some form , but they did n't know we would face a global financial crisis so severe , followed by the systemic crisis . 
  what they did was certainly na\u00efve , narcissistic even , but they did n't foresee the severity of how things would unfold . 
  because no sane person what would want this ? 
  probably only europe is this dumb . 
  ah , i see the eu is on a pr campaign again . 
   mateusz piskorski is a polish political activist . 
   as a student he joined the polish people 's party . 
  he was also active in various societies ** promoting the idea of pan-slavism and slavic nationalism . 
  ** [ 1 ] he ** published pamphlets which have been described as `` hardcore neo-nazi '' . 
  ** [ 2 ] he himself ** described his mindset as `` traditionalist nationalist '' ** . 
  [ 1 ] in 2000 he quit the people 's party and in 2002 joined the self-defence of the republic of poland party to become the assistant to member of parliament jan \u0141\u0105czny . 
  ** he brought with him a cohort of neo-nazi skinheads into the party . 
  ** sounds like the kind of guy rt or sputnik would interview indeed . 
  quite possible . 
  my former nokia was still made in finland . 
  [ samsung manufactures ] ( http://www.productfrom.com/products/0/samsung/0 ) most of its stuff in china . 
  it 's funny how everybody would have been better of without the euro . 
  and yet here we are . 
  yeah , sincerely fuck you un , we have more than the south already per capita . 
   yes , but outside of the ez , they would have been able to devaluate to get some breathing room . 
  at the moment they ca n't since the north is pulling the exchange rates up , and they are suffocating . 
  so they would be better of outside the ez . 
  and if they want to stay in the ez , they 'll have to tackle the corruption , bureaucracy and mis-management . 
   likewise , and until people can get their nationalist blinkers off , this stalemate will continue . 
  then it will continue a long time . 
  we may be europeans , we are n't the same people . 
  we will have our national politics for a long time to come . 
  and we will have stalemates for a long time . 
  everything is relative of course .
