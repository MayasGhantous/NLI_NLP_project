  because he does n't have it . 
  [ some parts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4zxuleqbm0 ) of sweden [ are ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20131014/50790 ) extremely [ anti-semitic ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/kippa-wearing-swedish-reporter-assaulted-in-malmo/ ) , malmo [ is one ] ( http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/96146/swedens-damn-jew-problem ) of those [ places ] ( http://www.jta.org/2013/08/01/news-opinion/world/reported-anti-semitic-attacks-tripled-in-malmo ) . 
  it 's just that swedes do n't care , so i 'm happy obama takes it serious . 
  when a deep fryer catches fire in a mosque sweden is in shock , when it 's about jews swedes do n't care an inch . 
   give me a break , sweden is probably one of the least antisemitic countries in europe . 
  and this is why obama sends a special envoy . 
  swedes still refuse to see the reality . 
   ... most of them financed by the european union . 
  of course it is . 
  what a waste . 
  for the south this is some much needed relieve . 
  if you earn , say , 1000 euro per month , your wage , from a perspective of a us consumer , just went from like 1400 dollar per month to 1060 dollar per month in half a year . 
  the rest of the world will not be so happy about this , and china and the us will be watching , and probably accounting for this in their monetary policies . 
  :p but do n't worry , this `` azerty2331321 '' guy called us ( netherlands ) uncivilized barbarians a few days ago because of some new defense cooperation with belgium . 
  do n't take it too serious . 
   are syriza waiting for public opinion to turn against the eu before threatening an exit ? 
  i think this is indeed their goal . 
  1,0714 dollar to the euro yesterday , [ 1,059 ] ( http://www.nu.nl/beurs/4008613/koers-van-euro-zakt-verder-beleid-ecb.html ) dollar to the euro now . 
  parity is not far of . 
   you forgot to mention live babies , live babies slowly cooked on a traditional coal fire spit is our favorite dish !, 
  i thought that was only a greek thing ? 
  he 's saying that the russian intervention was n't an act of power , but an act of weakness . 
  ' ... to help us bring rocks and sand out to the sea side . ', 
  well thank you !, 
  i think the differences are not that large . 
  at least smaller than between a frisian and a hollander . 
  it would work out fine as far as i see it . 
  ' ... we shall have to build a lot of dykes . ', 
       here 's my perspective : the proposed reforms are not unambiguously good and saying that everyone applying them is possible is a giant fallacy of composition . 
  i did n't say that , actually if you read my reply i expect it to be difficult , and do n't think it will work in all cases . 
  my solution is to leave the eurozone if it doesn ; t.  what do you want to gain ? 
  it 's a political arrangement , not a for-profit one . 
  what does amsterdam gain by being in a union with those backwards bible-belt parts of the netherlands ? 
  we have no backwards bible parts , and there 's not only no gain , there 's a lot of losses involved for us . 
   oh god , are we back to the magical vague reforms talk ? 
  `` we did the magical reforms and our economy is good , you do them too and your economy will be good too '' . 
  i 'm sorry you 're no longer capable of keeping your head cool enough to think , if reforms do n't work , a grexit might , and if not i really do n't care anymore as long you do n't burden us with it . 
  \u00d3\u00f3\u00f3r give wallonia to france , and merge flanders and the netherlands . 
  i know . 
  i just do not support the current form of the euro currency . 
  i do n't want to be in such an extensive cooperation with greece , because we gain nothing from it and would loose a lot . 
  i also understand the reforms are hard for other countries , but if they 're not implemented , like in france currently , those countries will suffer . 
  and the solution to that is leaving the eurozone , not begging for money because you did n't want it to work . 
  i prefer we would only work with the willing . 
  currently the greeks seem indicisive about it , maybe another few weeks might shed some light on their true course . 
  for the time being , we have cut 51 billion euro from the government budget in the past 3 years , we have now had a major increase in tax income and fallen way ahead of our planned financial goals . 
  not only will our relative state debt shrink from next year onwards ( which is already quite low at 74 % ) , they are going to lower our taxes now . 
  just as others , we have had to reform a lot , and we will reap what we have sown for ourselves . 
  we take care of ourselves now , just as the rest seems to do . 
  if others wish to rebel , there 's the hole of the door . 
  we are not some sort of nanny of europe , we 're a state with our own needs and interests , just like others . 
  no matter how hard that may be to understand for you . 
  the germans never bred hatred , they just did n't want to pay for greece as has been made clear numerous times , but was ignored numerous times . 
  nope , we disagreed with the qe package in line with germany . 
   i love how he fails to see the hole in his logic . 
  it does n't matter what he fails or does n't fail to see . 
  a fiscal union is not realistic on a short term , and with greece probably not on a long term either ( trust has been damaged too much ) if greece will suffer without a fiscal union , then you will suffer . 
  you 're free to leave the euro though , which might be the preferable option for all . 
  i personally would never support a fiscal union with greece , or any kind of transfers that way . 
  `` the ukraine '' is also used in russian , as that 's how the ukranian ssr was called . 
  the fact that / u/murtank is using `` the ukraine '' means he 's either not american , or he has been snooping in the wrong media . 
  the definition of human rights differ , if the people of saudi arabia think they do n't have enough rights they should pursue more . 
  you should also educate yourself on sweden since nothing you said about it is true . 
  and you 're right . 
  france is closer to spain and italy than to northern europe , they will be next on the list to be strangled by the euro . 
  especially since i do n't see them implementing the needed reforms , for which they are already running late . 
  we 're better of without a fiscal union . 
  that means they must leave the ez or stay in a crisis forever . 
   every nation has problems , exactly my point . 
   this is not away of how a government of a developed country and a member state of eu should behave . 
  this is greece we 're talking about , not a developed country . 
  you know , that country that threatened to veto spanish accession if it did n't get more agricultural subsidy , the country that threatened to veto all new expansion if cyprus was n't admitted . 
  greece has made blackmail to be a diplomatical agent , this is business as usual . 
  because we ca n't handle it . 
  who are we to tell how they have to live . 
  but that never crossed your narrow mind . 
  perhaps saudi arabia can ask sweden to first find a solution to there rape problems next time before they do trade again . 
  because the nation of rapists telling others how to live sounds a bit hypocritical . 
  n\u00e1\u00e1h , they 're weapons . 
  every dumbfuck understands they are n't used to treat the elders or feed the poor . 
  no i 'm saying this is a logical response if you breed hatred . 
  [ meanwhile in greece ] ( https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/greece-3.jpg?w=940&amp;h=654 ) [ that is ] ( http://www.dw.de/image/0,,16722048_303,00.jpg ) how they recieve [ german politicians . 
  ] ( http://www.thecommentator.com/system/articles/inner_pictures/000/003/051/thumb/121012_potw1-2merkel.jpg?1364310950 ), 
  most nato members do not commit to the 2 % rule , if britain wants to cut defense spending it should do so . 
  with the current wells we can be self sufficient until around 2040 . 
  right now we still export twice as much as we consume . 
  then again , we have lots of shale gas too , and lots of potential new wells in the north sea . 
  technologies will be far more developed in 2030 . 
  right now using the existent methods in the netherlands seems a bit of a waste . 
  wind mills are the only thing we can really use , but they do n't yield a lot and it 's a subsidy circle jerk . 
  it 's been said , if you fill one southern province of spain with solar panels , you have energy to meet the entire world consumption . 
  we should be investing in that , not in wind mills all over our country . 
  we have gas . 
  that 's already a lot cleaner than the coal plants in many countries . 
  wales . 
  berlin does n't have the historical centre of many other european city 's for obvious reasons . 
  otherwise it 's a great place . 
  is there any reason to put oostende on it ? 
  i would advice brugge when you 're in belgium . 
  even above brussels if time is an issue .
