  it 's not because i do n't like brits , it 's merely because i do n't want other countries to have an incentive to leave the union and for every former member to get a ` better ' deal ( = worse deal for the eu as a whole ) resulting in the dismantling of the entire union . 
  not something like * anschlie\u00dfen * ? 
  this treaty was signed by grand pensionary johan van oldenbarneveldt , but prince maurits of orange was against the peace treaty because he thought he could defeat the spaniards . 
  it was the start of a rivalry between van oldenbarneveldt and maurits , which resulted in the beheading of van oldenbarneveldt after a political trial in 1619 . 
  it was made by [ claes jansz . 
  visscher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/claes_jansz._visscher ) in 1609 . 
  yeah , i also saw her in an interview where she did n't understand the questions posed , but now i feel sorry for her !, 
  the leo belgicus is pretty popular , some other examples : [ 1 ] ( http://www.labrujulaverde.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cartografia-historica-curiosa2.jpg ) and [ 2 ] ( https://www.eshcc.eur.nl/uploads/rtemagicc_leeuw_03.jpg.jpg ) . 
  enjoy !, 
  [ here 's the second one in high resolution ] ( https://images8.alphacoders.com/437/437949.jpg ) , so you can actually see the city paintings . 
  edit : [ i posted it on this subreddit !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5fbq8p/leo_belgicus_popular_map_of_the_low_countries/ ), 
  i ca n't seem to find this youtube video , could you help ? 
  it was a female croatian mep ( ? ), 
  in some sort of commission holding a speech from her chair and she was kind of shouting , but her english was incomprehensible . 
  edit : [ found it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oijio7ymqo8 ) . 
  it 's actually not that bad , it 's just her accent : `` people must trust us ! '', 
  it 's not like all connections to the roman history disappeared when other peoples arrived ... 
  i do n't know what 's worse , being called [ belgica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallia_belgica ) or [ germania inferior ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germania_inferior ) . 
  neither can i actually . 
  croatian politics look like a comedy show . 
  i remember this video of a croatian politician pretending to speak english in the european parliament but failing miserably answering the questions from the interviewer . 
  based on a misplaced sense of entitlement : `` we brits * deserve * a better deal . '', 
  [ united kingdom of the netherlands ] ( http://www.adegem.net/spaander/img/leo_belgicus.jpg ), 
   honestly i do n't believe any majority muslim country should be in the eu that 's why i 'm glad the uk is finally leaving !, 
  england means ` scary land ' in dutch . 
  i hope not , i would want my country to veto turkish accession as long as a majority of the electorate consists of conservative islamists . 
  neighbourly love < 3, 
  want ? 
  flair checks out . 
  the [ bombing of nijmegen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_nijmegen ) was clearly a mistake though . 
  i 'm not entirely sure , there 's different theories on where it came from . 
  it 's just a derogatory term used for germans . 
  i think you could compare it to jerry or kraut that is or was used in england . 
  germans were called * moffen * , and this hatred lasted for most of the last century . 
  now that the war generation is slowly dying , there 's little animosity between the germans and the dutch . 
  the allied forces also bombed a number of dutch cities by mistake , this caused the germans to spread propaganda that you guys were worse than the german occupier , but that did n't work . 
  we * hated * the germans . 
  if you want to grasp some of the old atmosphere you could recommend kralingen or delfshaven . 
  that 's the [ rotterdam city hall ] ( http://www.rotterdamarchitectuurprijs.nl/media/images/thumb_constrain_1136_1136/stadhuis_ext03.jpg ) . 
  remarkable how it was spared from the destruction caused be the bombings . 
  we did the same with [ parts of enschede ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_wnja_h68zy/vlh9xni0uei/aaaaaaaafce/ntrryruq60u/s1600/1.jpg ) in 2000 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enschede_fireworks_disaster, 
  thanks for this response , saved me some time . 
  fight this man in parliament , not in court . 
  they already sell charlie in bookstores/kiosks in french i guess , so i do n't expect any outrage . 
  that sounds exactly like portugal though . 
  no , it 's up and running . 
  they 're part of the law making process , hence lawmakers . 
  a folding bike will be among the infantry 's basic equipment . 
  what eternal neutrality ? 
  is that some kind of excuse to underspend on military service ? 
   they beat brazil in their own country so did we . 
  we call it belgium . 
  tiny huh ? 
  so where 's your overseas territory ? 
  perhaps * snakken * in dutch : ` to severely desire something ' . 
  that 's * stoom afblazen * in dutch , it 's something different . 
  i hope budapest wins the bidding procedure , it would be their first olympic games . 
  france has had five already . 
  welcome into the visegrad group austria !, 
  well delft and bolsward are n't distant islands or exclaves . 
  they were chosen because of their representativeness in the last elections . 
  one lies in urban holland the other in rural frisia , there is no indication that they would not be representative . 
  because ? 
  nobody said anything about it being representative for today . 
  thank you . 
  you must understand that those were dictatorships at the time and scandinavia , uk/ireland is part of western europe in the context of west vs. east . 
  i hope you 're not trying to argue that a nationwide vote would show a different outcome , because 94 % is not particularly ambiguous . 
  well , it most likely included the countries of the ecsc , i do n't think they expected soviet russia or its satellite states to be a part of it . 
  you are talking about a different referendum . 
  these were dummy referendums , not actual referendums in the sense that they were legally binding in any way . 
  a kid in the 1950s would make him about 70 years old . 
  if frazeri is a woman , it 'd be even more difficult to gay marry a man , do n't you think ? 
  * * uhm , that 's really dull french , we say ` rigolo ' ... * stupid french text books . 
  i did n't mean you guys , i meant northern dutch as in the netherlands in general as opposed to belgium . 
  in northern dutch it 's even more rough of course , but everything sounds soft compared to northern dutch . 
  when comparing west-flemish to french it 's certainly pretty rough . 
  brugge , which has a pretty rough ending , in english however it sounds like a french town . 
  lovely picture , but gosh ... the english word for this town is so ridiculous . 
  i must say he 's a well respected politician , straightforward and decent . 
  why is this ugly ? 
  seems like a normal subway station to me . 
  wow , who taught you that ? 
  you too like u2 ? 
  not all cities are like that though , it 's mostly in the randstad and former industrial cities . 
  the greenhouses light the night sky , as you can see in these pictures : [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/delft_city_hall_winter.jpg ) and [ 2 ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ql3obyvuc0k/uqym5vsiv6i/aaaaaaaaahc/jhofk8oklks/s1600/20131006-img_4216.jpg ) . 
  i guess it 's a mixture , [ here ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@51.9844306,4.1974225,3a,75y,42.25h,81.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shakavkg11ul-orxotydkaq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) you can see what it looks like on the ground . 
  [ this ] ( http://imgb.igcdn.nl/30183b2ee3504a5d95f26a6595706740/opener/dronebeelden_van_de_schade_heel_veel_kassen_kapot.jpg ) is a picture of greenhouses in north-brabant after a storm this summer . 
  not right now . 
  both , it 's mostly the homes of the owners , but there 's also lots of relatives and non-farmers that live in those houses . 
  as you can see the greenhouses are scattered alongside villages , like [ this one ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/2522203.jpg ) . 
   what good will come from a cooperation that is initiated by the reluctance to spend a dime . 
  synergy and economies of scale that is . 
  indeed , this is in [ holland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/delft_city.jpg ) . 
   islam is not a religion , it 's an ideology , the ideology of a retarded culture . 
  islamic believe is a relic of ancient times and in many ways regressive and retarded , though the same can be said about certain denominations of christianity and judaism . 
   the koran is a fascist book which incites violence . 
  that is why this book , just like [ adolf hitler 's ] mein kampf , must be banned . 
  there 's no good reason to make a distinction between mein kampf and the quran ( or bible for that matter ) as both books are used for study , but also inciting hate and violence . 
  i personally believe neither should be banned , but i do n't see how it 's somehow wrong to call for equal treatment .
