   islam wants to destroy us and i want to prevent it . 
  certain elements within islam most certainly do and you must be able to fight religion as long as the constitution is respected . 
  imagine him saying ` communism wants to destroy us and i want to prevent it . ', 
  no one would bat an eye , but replace it with a religion and it 's somehow gruesome ? 
  on the 17th of december 1952 , citizens of delft and bolsward in the netherlands were asked in a referendum about their opinion on the future of europe . 
  these two places were chosen because they had proven to be a good reflection of nationwide voting based on the national elections of june 1952 . 
  an overwhelming majority of 93.5 % voted in favour of a democratic federal state with one european constitution ( turn-out 76.1 % ) . 
  footage of the referendum : [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmde85vvqj0 ) ( commentary in dutch ) . 
  two voters explained their voting : man at 1:12 : * `` it is my firm believe that a country like the netherlands can not manage the future on its own and that it is absolutely necessary to work together in a federal context with other countries in western europe , and that 's why i voted in favour . 
  '' * woman at 1:26 : * `` i vote in favour , because we as future housewives may expect more prosperity and safety for our children . 
  '' * the ballot paper read :  is it your opinion , that the european peoples should from now on look after certain common interests together , and do you therefore wish :  a united europe  under a european government  and with a democratic representation  to be described in a european constitution ? 
   yes  no this event must obviously be placed in the historic context of post world war ii sentiments , stalin 's iron curtain and the korean war . 
  similar referendums were held in belgium ( 1953 ) and germany ( 1951 ) and they showed similar support . 
  the parliament of the european coal and steel community installed a commission instructed to design a european constitution and they came up with a draft proposal in 1953 . 
  the french however did not like ** the idea of a common european army ** and the * assembl\u00e9e nationale * on the 30th of august 1954 rejected the proposal as such . 
  this put the plan for a european constitution on ice . 
  in 2005 the dutch rejected ( 61.5 % against ) a new proposal for a european constitution , and so did the citizens of delft ( 52.2 % against ) and bolsward ( 59.4 % against ) . 
  the momentum had already taken flight long before .

   bar england and france and maybe germany to a lesser extent you would struggle to find black people . 
  in the european countryside that is , in western european cities there are plenty . 
  the skills you are supposed to learn in history class such as critical thinking and source evaluation , do not necessarily require you to go over a given subject . 
  your school could still be a good school if it taught you those skills using european or asian history . 
  whether american history should be taught in schools is more a question of citizenship and national awareness rather than quality . 
  [ this question has already been answered a few months ago actually . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/69e2av/what_do_european_schools_teach_about_the_united/ ) let me just quote my answer . 
   u.s. history was part of my final exam curriculum , mainly 1860s-1970s history . 
  wars , foreign policy , industrialisation , segregation and stuff like that . 
  theodore roosevelt 's fight against monopolies , jim crow laws , franklin d. roosevelt 's new deal , assassination of john f. kennedy , opposition to the vietnam war in the 60s/70s . 
  and perhaps most importantly , the german constitution does * not * think parading with guns and swastikas calling for the destruction of other races is an okay practice . 
  that 's a downside ? 
  rotterdam is indeed less dense than amsterdam as it 's no longer got a historic inner city . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/view_from_the_euromast_in_rotterdam%2c_the_netherlands.jpg ) could have very well been a new england city if you ask me . 
  we add toxins to our eggs ... o wait this one 's no longer obscure . 
  no , i responded to this :  can you seriously say that things like the charleston shooter , or this insanity in charlottesville , or trump , are happening on the left ? 
  did i claim that ? 
  i claimed that you can indeed say that things like this happen on the left as well . 
  [ apparently you can . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_congressional_baseball_shooting ), 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure the us is not yet at the stage of nazi-germany . 
  how to deal with it ? 
  by remembering there are lunatics and extremists everywhere . 
  yes , donald trump is a complete idiot , and yes this is generally the opinion of most people that have an opinion on him here , but there are also plenty of great and admirable americans out there , a majority even , that do not deserve to be victims of the despicable actions of a few . 
  i live in rotterdam which has a system that encompasses [ trains ] ( http://media.nu.nl/m/m1oxo7jahtq8_wd1280.jpg/ns-medewerkers-rotterdam-leggen-werk-neer-protest.jpg ) , [ metros ] ( http://www.foto.vanbeloois.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/dsc_8110.jpg ) , [ trams ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7150/6499112511_9fd36a3422_b.jpg ) , [ busses ] ( https://www.ret.nl/fileadmin/user_upload/afbeeldingen/fotobeelden_totaal/man_en_kind_bij_bushalte_1920x1080.jpg ) and [ waterbusses ] ( http://www.dewaterbus.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rotterdam-erasmusbrug-1024x681.jpg ) . 
  this is what the main station looks like from the [ inside ] ( http://www.teamv.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/02-rotterdam-cs_jhml1309-6088.jpg ) and the [ outside ] ( http://www.thomasheye.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rotterdam-5.jpg ) . 
  public transport can be crowded at times , but it 's generally clean , on time and efficient . 
  i 've actually heard that stereotype as well , though i never took it seriously . 
  i 've had a man tell me people in belgium spoke dutch only , those who spoke french just refused to speak their mother tongue of dutch ... 
  it 's a very specific question about one airliner , i do n't think this is the right sub . 
  no , because that 's me visiting other places in europe as well . 
  i would never judge anyone on that . 
  it 's a national airliner and it 's not low-budget , what more do you need to know , is n't it about getting you from a to b ? 
  i think the biggest difference is [ religious heritage ] ( http://i.imgur.com/st10dr2.png ) , the south being traditionally a catholic region whereas the north is traditionally protestant . 
  this has caused a lot of differences in culture , politics and architecture that are still visible to this day . 
  another difference is the guttural g-sound which is far more soft ( or non-existent ) in the south than it is up north . 
  that actually really surprises me . 
  are you originally a palestinian from a refugee enclave in syria ? 
  i 'm not aware of any european wide services , but there exist quite a few national websites . 
  before fb we used to have [ hyves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyves ) which was a very large social network site , but it succombed to fb . 
  the largest dutch forum website is [ fok !, 
  it kind of does . 
   this is why we hate you , westerners . 
  ok , if that 's what your identity evolves around , so be it . 
   i certainly found myself thinking how beautiful and practical at the same time the covered passageways that line almost every street of the old town they sure were practical when trying to hide from the sun in 39 degree weather , 
  true , zwarte piet would be watching you and if you misbehaved he would tell sinterklaas , meaning no presents for you in december . 
  i happily welcome all nations that joined the eu after 2000 , they truly add value to the union and i am glad the eu gives them opportunities they might otherwise not have had . 
  if you rather live under a ` non-western ' regime that seeks to destroy the west , perhaps you could try and apply for asylum in pyongyang . 
  the eu army talk was n't really a thing until after brexit . 
  before it was just an idea not taken seriously by any member state , now closer cooperation on defence seems more likely , but we 're still miles away from anything like an eu army . 
  besides , there was no obligation for the uk to participate in an eu army , or really any closer eu cooperation so leaving the eu seems like an over the top response to those concerns . 
  i grew up in the town of delft ( [ pic1 ] ( https://indebuurt.nl/content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/sneeuw-delft.jpg ) ; [ pic2 ] ( https://scontent-amt2-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/16584917_156271448211112_5178628169720135680_n.jpg ) ) and i have always felt it to be a very ordinary place to live . 
  it does become ` normal ' , but that does n't mean i do n't appreciate living in a continent with beautiful historic inner cities . 
  i still go out to explore and admire my home town . 
  it think it 's become a public park , and they 're currently hosting the iaaf world championships in the olympic stadium . 
  they 're in a lot of places actually , i 've even seen them in italy . 
  they 're also everywhere in the netherlands . 
  i would say london is the capital of the anglo-saxon world if that makes sense . 
  the global capital being new york city . 
   we went on asking a third person , a french girl , what she thought , and she believed it was london . 
  i hope she was n't being serious . 
  brussels , strasbourg , luxembourg or even berlin or paris would make some sense , but london ? 
  and gold stolen from our safes in amsterdam , bought by the swiss , basically making us finance our own war enemy . 
  still the swiss refuse to return the gold . 
  rode haak presumably . 
  rhode island also stems from rood eiland ( pronounced the same way ) , meaning red island . 
  lots of places in new york such as harlem and brooklyn , because of the new netherland colony . 
  there 's also a lot of surinamese and south african towns named after dutch places . 
  then of course there are places with dutch names , but not specifically named after a dutch town , such as windhoek ( namibia ) and johannesburg ( south africa ) . 
  i 'm afraid that amount will only get you a private parking place . 
  definitely new york city , i think it 's safe to say half of those trips feature nyc in one way or another . 
  [ amsterdam ] ( https://youtu.be/kas-aiy83d0 ) sung by the belgian singer kris de bruyne is one of my favourites . 
  france is the largest holiday destination , followed in descending order by germany , spain , italy , belgium , austria , greece , the uk , turkey and the us . 
  luckily you have proven to know very little on the concept of racism . 
  so people with blond hair and blue eyes are racists ? 
  they are quite clearly equating them to animals with a basic instinct to make a nazi salute . 
  how is this not a mockery ? 
  do you really think they would even consider broadcasting ` save the negro ' ? 
   if in some country there 's a high percentage of blacks who fear the annihilation of their `` race '' and lobby against letting non-blacks people into the country , it 'd be perfectly fine to shoot a film like this with switched skin colors . 
  there is a high percentage of white people that believes in white genocide ? 
  what is this high percentage you are talking about ?
