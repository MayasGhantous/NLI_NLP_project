  it was played everywhere in the summer of 2004 .

  topnotch is a very successful hip-hop record label with most of its music in dutch . 
  as i was reading this , a cold breeze entered my room through the open window ~ . ~, 
  16 \u00b0 c , it 's okay but a bit cloudy ( though you ca n't see it as it 's night time ) . 
  frankfurt ( germany ) and belfast ( uk ) . 
  yet he links the userbase being american to a lack of questions about europe . 
  this is n't europeans ask europe . 
  art works by johannes vermeer , rembrandt van rijn , vincent van gogh , hieronymus bosch , piet mondrian , etc. 
  honestly never heard of it . 
  just for the record , i have n't downvoted you as i do n't believe in downvoting someone with a different opinion . 
  i do n't see how trump is supposedly a smart guy ( he seems pretty dumb actually ) and young americans being liberals has little to do with that . 
  there are n't many movies with dutch actors or actresses , and there are even less that i 've actually seen . 
  for now , i 'll say taken featuring famke janssen . 
  do you also not hate trump but hate the things he does ? 
  it would definitely hurt google a lot , they generate about $ 20 billion in revenues in europe each year . 
  the northern regions of france have more in common with the benelux than with mediterranean countries . 
  cities like dunkerque ( duinkerken ) , arras ( atrecht ) and lille ( rijsel ) have dutch/flemish architecture and history . 
  i do n't think france can be classified as either northwestern or mediterranean , it 's ambiguous . 
  but that also kind of undermines your argument . 
  nope , this is not a thing where i live and we have quite some highrise buildings ( still less than america ) . 
  i do n't think this is about culture , it 's more about geographical region . 
  clearly cyprus and portugal have little in common . 
  i think the biggest difference is [ religious heritage ] ( http://i.imgur.com/st10dr2.png ) , the south being traditionally a catholic region whereas the north is traditionally protestant . 
  this has caused a lot of differences in culture , politics and architecture that are still visible to this day . 
  another difference is the guttural g-sound which is far more soft ( or non-existent ) in the south than it is up north . 
  alive or dead ? 
  it smells like bullshit . 
  the uk wants to close off its airspace ? 
  [ this 19th century painting ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iqkdup0.jpg ) by frederik marinus kruseman seems very dutch to me . 
  i really liked this song and she actually did pretty well ( 10th place ) . 
  much better than the last couple of years . 
  totally political , but also very funky . 
  as long as you do n't plan on staying in 4/5-star hotels , it should be fine . 
  lasha tumbai = russia goodbye, 
  [ germany 2011 ] ( https://youtu.be/kqzprvpwlce ) had a futuristic song with dancing condoms . 
  sometimes it does seem like opposition to social democratic policies is opposition toward ` libtards ' , ` democrats ' and whatnot rather than toward those actual policies . 
  this is not solely an american thing though , it happens in a lot of democracies . 
  a two-party system just makes it more apparent . 
  it kinda does .

  mostly english , i 'm a fan of dan brown 's . 
  just finished the lost symbol . 
  currently reading a novel by stephen king . 
  the last time i read a book in dutch was in high school . 
  reading in english is more challenging and therefore more gratifying if that makes sense . 
  overall , dutch novels are more popular in the netherlands , but reading in english is not uncommon at all , especially among young adults .

  it 's played on the radio a lot , and it 's in the spotify top 5 . 
  it 's pretty popular . 
  i 'm not sure , but a parent is of course different from a great grandparent . 
  i am very friendly toward dogs , they 're not always friendly toward me . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  i find it ridiculous and it 's definitely something italy will have to look into . 
  they 're basically handing out eu citizenship to total strangers with zero connection to their country , which in the end also affects other eu countries . 
  i am sure you are a nice fellow , but you 're not an italian and you should n't be given citizenship in my opinion . 
  they almost seem related !, 
   i know it was nearly impossible to get the visa but they 've just introduced a new short stay with no visa . 
  if i 'm correct this only applies if you arrive at minsk international airport by plane . 
  yes , that 's correct . 
   ( probably bad grammar or het vs de usage but whatever ) * de man drinkt een glas zeewater bij de zee . 
  just a minor error . 
  saying ` een glas van zeewater ' would mean the glass is made of seawater .

  both sound okay to me . 
  my god ... 
  you ca n't renounce your us citizenship if you have n't acquired another one . 
  the us would be breaching international law . 
  frisian : de fisker oan board fan it skip seach in iisberch rane yn it waarme en stille oseaanwetter . 
  english : * the fisherman on board the ship saw an iceberg melt in the warm and still ocean water . 
  when i put the marker in my hometown , the preview showed water because it 's below sea level / (-_-), 
  did you get the reference to [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrltaksxonk ) as a new dutchie ? 
  haha , and just when i posted this i was wondering how odd it was to have a logo written in english in that time frame . 
  perhaps not exactly what you 're looking for but there 's [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlhz_z8sums ) which mingles dutch and french . 
  and then there 's [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgsgajiydro ) which is in dutch and sranan ( a local surinamese language ) . 
   kris de bruyne ( be ) - amsterdam from the [ cheese commercial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2km9tbcj148 ) , 
  in the last 6 years we 've had an average of 12.6 days of snowfall a year , the average since 1980 has been 22.8 days a year . 
  snow is actually not that uncommon , we 've just had a few bad years . 
  it 's okay , during the summer it can get really uncomfortable with temperatures often rising to 28-33 degrees celsius which can be unbearable in the swamp we live in . 
  i 've been through 40 degrees celsius abroad , but nothing beats 30 degrees with humidity levels of 90-100 % . 
  those periods usually do n't last very long though ( only a couple of days ) . 
  i wish it would snow more often during winter as winters are generally soft . 
  the coldest temperature i can remember was -20 degrees celsius , but that only happens once every five years or so . 
  what you consider to be a frugal life is a luxurious life in the eyes of billions of people on earth . 
  i am in favour of joint european external border control and i would support building refugee centers in third countries around europe to which we send immigrants crossing our borders illegally . 
  however , i do n't think the eu should be able to impose quotas on countries , the member states should be able to decide how many immigrants they want to accept for themselves . 
  would be cool to have flood drills : `` everybody , toward the rooftop ! '', 
  i feel a strong connection to the eu , but not necessarily to its current leaders . 
  i just like the idea and the fact i can feel united with so many great peoples on this continent , and not just by being friends , but by truly being family . 
  the dutch word ` veld ' ( * velt * is an old spelling variant ) , the english word ` field ' and the german word ` feld ' all stem from the same word in [ proto-germanic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-germanic_language ) , whereas the english word ` belt ' stems from the latin word ` balteus ' . 
  if you go way back that 's probably true . 
  i have some german and even some slovakian-jewish ancestry , but it does n't show at all . 
  van buren even spoke english as a second language . 
  roosevelt means `` field of roses '' .
