  i learnt about it later through books and the internet so now i know much more about it , but it 's not a topic that got much attention in school unfortunately . 
  america does n't have a problem with health care quality , your problem is with accessibility . 
  sometimes you hear about patients getting told treatment is no longer possible/sensible , and some of them opt for an experimental treatment in the us . 
  i guess a lot of health care research is done by american companies and universities and perhaps legislation for medical experiments is less strict in the us ? 
  a little bit about the slave trade in which the caribbean islands were functioning as hubs/markets , whereas suriname also had plantations . 
  the dutch east indies were exploited for their herbs and spices . 
  we also learn a little bit about surinamese independence in 1975 , mostly because it was a peaceful transition of power as opposed to the indonesian independence war after wwii . 
  there 's very little if anything about new netherlands in america , but i do remember the cape colony in south africa getting mentioned . 
  sometimes you hear about new healthcare techniques/treatments provided in the united states that are n't yet accessible/available in europe . 
  i did n't know manneken pis was a homophobe , how dare he piss on that rainbow flag !, 
  there 's always an excuse to explore europe , 
  not sure if you 're a luxembourger feeling dutch , or you just picked the wrong flair . 
  the adjacent square is impressive enough already . 
  what i find slightly annoying about the manneken pis statue is the fact you constantly cover him up . 
  it 's already small as it is , no use in tucking it in under a giant [ costume ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-chgxr_1krti/unbmeketxzi/aaaaaaaaakg/aj4mgud1fw0/s1600/schermafbeelding+2012-12-18+om+11.57.21.png ) . 
  i think i 've only once seen the actual statue irl because of that . 
  those are all over europe !, 
  well mountainous europe . 
  well , it 's not really a holocaust museum so you wo n't find large exhibitions on camp auschwitz or something like that . 
  it 's the anne frank house so unsurprisingly it 's going to be about anne frank . 
  i think other places in amsterdam like the hollandsche schouwburg , the jewish historic museum and the national holocaust museum are more appropriate places for that more general approach . 
  i agree with you that it 's fine the way it is now . 
  showing the personal hardship anne , her family , friends and acquaintances had to go through makes it more impactful in my opinion , more so than displaying pictures of atrocities or communicating figures on how many people died in the holocaust , however impressive that may be . 
  i never had to wait very long , but that 's because i live relatively close and have the opportunity to visit off-season . 
  all in all , i would n't say it 's overrated , but it might be underwhelming if your expectations are inaccurate . 
  i do n't think the anne frank house is overrated . 
  it 's an important place historically , and a living symbol of the holocaust . 
  that nearly all belgian villages are [ linear settlements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linear_settlement ) . 
  it did n't , the only way it affected us was an influx of 1 million belgian refugees . 
  you are delusional . 
  i think our country can handle about 10.000 vulnerable refugees ( handicapped , elderly , orphans , non-muslims ) a year and some 20.000 highly-skilled moderate migrants/refugees a year . 
  all others should receive help in neighbouring countries , possibly through financial aid from rich countries in the west and the arabian peninsula . 
  we were not involved in wwi , so i do n't expect anything . 
  it 's near maastricht , who knows ... 
  yeah i like some , like the two you mentioned . 
  and even though i dislike his personality , [ boef ] ( https://youtu.be/ashbgnrsvyc ) is undeniable at this point in time . 
  i knew about it , but i only found out about it recently . 
   arizona or utah ? 
  what about mars ? 
  jk , it also looks pretty similar to the [ backdrop of the icelandic geysir ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/30/geysir-iceland-2.jpg ) . 
  russia has a big disadvantage here , being such a large country it encompasses so much different natural beauty . 
  i know right , just look at this beautiful [ dutch polder ] ( https://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/72-hours-saba-gear-patrol-lead-full.jpg ) :'(, 
  i used to listen to [ sexion d'assaut ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7-vp7tnluy ) and some of its rappers individually . 
  i also liked stromae 's [ collaboration ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9hw4mlnp5e ) with ma\u00eetre gims and orelsan . 
  not my proudest moment , but i also enjoy some of [ colonel royel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyxw64l-xza ) 's songs . 
  it 's in the + # links . 
  [ andr\u00e9 hazes - wij \u2665 oranje ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8i76a8fiyy ), 
  it really does feel like being abroad sometimes . 
  just look at this beautiful [ dutch chateau ] ( http://cdn.pm-network.nl/sites/8/2014/04/chateau_neercanne1.jpg ) . 
  you only recognise it as dutch because of the pink bike lane , 
  ] ( http://www.madebymone.nl/fotografie/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/panorama-2a.jpg ) no , the [ loonse en drunense duinen ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/2012-08-25_loonse_en_drunense_duinen.jpg ) in north brabant . 
  * [ south africa ?

  there is a light , guiding my way , keeping me safe ... 
  i did n't mind the extra ice , but it 's not something i miss here at home . 
  your free refills are pretty awesome though . 
  well let 's hope those historians in 2117 still know the meaning of historical context . 
   while `` strano '' is counterpart to strange in english originally from the latin word * extraneus * which entered the english language through french . 
  not only in flemish , what about ` schoonheid ' , ` wonderschoon ' , etc. 
  the - eke is not uniquely flemish , it 's used in many dutch dialects and even in frisian . 
  tuscany region , plan on visiting florence and its surroundings . 
  make up your mind people !, 
  la bella italia !, 
   how long can ** non-europeans ** stay in europe ? 
   she 's from ** macedonia ** u wot m8, 
  some people think it 's nonsense , but the thing is , if you ignore these changes , you will look dumb as people will think you 're not properly educated . 
  writing a job application letter without using official spelling is a total no go . 
  so yes there was some outrage and some major newspapers said they would use their own spelling systems , but these initiatives kind of died off . 
  there was supposed to be another revision in 2015 though , but the language union called it off ... 
  they are enforced by the governments of the netherlands and belgium so they do n't really take place gradually . 
  since 1980 the dutch language union is responsible for setting up the spelling rules for the dutch language area , their last revision stems from 2005 . 
  since then we spell certain compound words differently : pannekoek --  panne ** n ** koek ( * pancake * ) . 
  only old fashioned , not wrong at all to be honest , although if i had to actively use the case system myself i would make a lot of errors . 
  it has actually changed quite a lot over the last hundred years , some examples of changes . 
  * the - sch ending disappeared for some words : mensch --  mens ( * human * ) , visch --  vis ( * fish * ) * the ` th ' disappeared in some words : athleet --  atleet ( * athlete * ) , autheur --  auteur ( * author * ) , panther --  panter ( * panther * ) * der/den/des became ` de ' although the old cases are still used in some expressions . 
  * a lot of double vowels disappeared : boomen --  bomen ( * trees * ) , beenen --  benen ( * legs * ) , zoo --  zo ( * so * ) to show how these changes affected the language , i translated a short fragment from an old newspaper ( 1920 ) : original : de aanvraag ** der ** uitlevering van ** den ** ex-keizer heeft in alle kringen van nederland ** groote ** beweging veroorzaakt . 
  well , it 's their official stance and there is no doubt in my mind that they would vote against euthanasia if it were ever put to a vote again . 
  there was no norwegian habbo version ? 
  charles is already on the 10 pound note , charles darwin that is . 
  they make up about 5 % of the population based on the seats held by conservative christian parties in parliament that are against euthanasia ( christenunie and sgp ) , their political influence is limited . 
  euthanasia is allowed in case of ** unbearable suffering without chance of improvement ** . 
  in practice this means anyone that can show they 're suffering chronically and have no prospect of getting better , can ask their doctor to carry out a request to be euthanised . 
  a second doctor will have to agree with the request . 
  the suffering does not have to be physical , it can also be non-physical such as with dementia or mental disease . 
  these rights are not under any serious threat . 
  there are even some parties that want to introduce ` voluntary end of life ' for elders who are not suffering unbearably , but who feel like their life is no longer worth while and just want to get it over with . 
  this might sound cruel but i much rather die on my own terms when i feel the time is right , than because of an infection at age 95 while sitting in a wheelchair all day being completely demented . 
  i like scottish : thrrree, 
  my initial response when i see danish number plates is what are they doing this far south . 
  driving from the netherlands to portugal is a long way as it is , now for a dane ... 
   why do n't we leave and adopt the euro while we 're at it that might become a realistic option if you keep on butchering your currency . 
  except it 's not really credible to claim you first started learning english after you turned 18 . 
  perfect native accent in languages learned during adulthood ? 
  very few people achieve that , if it can be achieved at all . 
  i certainly would n't trust anyone here claiming they managed to get a perfect native accent , unless they already spoke a closely related language . 
  it 's actually in the film if i remember it correctly . 
  * quite a good film for dutch standards .
