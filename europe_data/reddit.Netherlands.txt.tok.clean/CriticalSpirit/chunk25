  the [ rampjaar 1672 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rampjaar ) ( disaster year 1672 ) in which the dutch republic was simultaneously under attack from the english at sea , the french in the south and the bishops of m\u00fcnster and cologne in the eastside of the republic . 
  despite initially losing some territory , the dutch republic fought back and managed to first defeat the english navy , then push back the french and eventually make peace with the german invaders . 
  the dutch navy was led by michiel de ruyter , a few years ago they made a [ movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j21t1i_siki ) about him . 
  it 's actually quite a good film . 
  brexit means brexit and we 're going to make a success of it !, 
  though i can only truly speak for my own area/country , you should n't have any problems visiting us . 
  there are tons of asian tourists ( chinese , indonesian , malay , etc. ), 
  in amsterdam and even here in the towns and cities of south holland . 
  there are no negative stereotypes associated with southeast asians in general here so it should be totally fine . 
  world : [ 77 % in 11:30 ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/86f63adc48a281040c1770c0cdb74d8e.png ) . 
  us states : [ 88 % in 2:10 ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/5e0a328b9ea02c0524434533b1434994.png ) . 
  57 % , i got a few misclicks because of my tiny phone screen , not too bad i 'd say . 
  fun fact : the dutch word ` volksliederen ' is actually a grammatical error . 
  it used to be ` volkslieder ' here as well but people started adding - en because they no longer recognised - er as plural . 
  the same applies to words like ` kinderen ' and ` eieren ' . 
  the exact same happened in english : ` childre/childer ' --  ` children ' ( analogous to ` brethren ' ) . 
  in my opinion private companies should be free to set their own job requirements . 
  if they want their employees to be able to speak english , be my guest , if they want them to speak dutch , that 's up to them . 
  i do n't think we should force them to be less demanding if that hurts their business . 
  if they ca n't find enough qualified dutch speakers the market will self-regulate and force them to change their requirements . 
  i understand your fear , and it is part of being human to have those concerns . 
  however , as mentioned by others , rationally speaking there 's a very small chance you will ever be involved in a terror attack and even if you are involved in one , the chances of you dying are even less . 
  it 's like flying , you know it 's safe but whenever you hear about a plane crash you start feeling uneasy about it . 
  do n't let fear take over . 
  ghent  antwerp , definitely worth a stop over . 
  the 15th century is 1400-1500 , those houses are over 500 years old . 
  de telegraaf is the most read newspaper in the netherlands , but it 's known to cater to populist sentiments ; they openly admit pushing an agenda . 
  other newspapers such as nrc and de volkskrant might suffer from different biases , more left leaning ones , but in general they seem impartial and accurate . 
  living in a city that was eradicated in 1940 and rebuilt afterwards makes me very much aware of recent history . 
  history explains a lot of today 's world , such as our relationships with other countries and our former colonies . 
  it explains who we are as a nation , why we have a monarch , why we are a democracy and so much more . 
  i live in the second largest city of the country and see police cars and officers on a regular basis , let 's say a few times a week . 
  why do people not use them ? 
  is it in russian only ? 
  should be just fine , it might not be ideal if it gets hot , but it wo n't kill you . 
  the first part ( 's - her ) is pronounced like the spanish word ` ser ' . 
  bmw , fiat , ferrari , lamborghini , mercedes , volkswagen , saab , volvo , skoda , audi , alfa romeo , aston martin , dacia , bentley , seat , renault , citroen , maserati , opel , peugeot , porsche , rover , rolls-royce are some top-notch car brands . 
  just because we do n't have many tech companies , it does n't mean we do n't excel in other markets , like automobiles , fashion and booze . 
  shell , airbus , unilever , philips , heineken , spotify , adidas , siemens , nestl\u00e9 , h&m , ikea , red bull , danone , puma , skype , gucci , prada , chanel , l'or\u00e9al , giorgio armani and zara to name just a few . 
  at pre-university level , more people follow german classes than french classes . 
  latin is the third most popular language , followed by old greek ( 4 ) and spanish ( 5 ) . 
  dutch and english being mandatory , next to one of these . 
  yet most of his voters probably know very little about climate change and will go with the mainstream opinion of it being caused by human activity . 
  paris , there was a time i would visit once every year . 
  pale skin , darkish brown hair , green eyes . 
  [ i see . 
  human trafficking , just when you thought it could n't get any worse . 
  not that i am aware of , i have never met anyone who does n't believe in climate change or thinks it 's not that urgent . 
  asians in general is far too , well , general . 
  when it comes to filipinos i must say i have only met one filipino family in my life , and they are actually family friends . 
  they are highly educated and well integrated , the kind of immigrant everyone would love ( or should love ) . 
  their being filipino is obviously mentioned sometimes and we cared for their family in the philippines ( especially during typhoon haiyan we donated money ) , but apart from that they 're nothing out of the ordinary , they 're as dutch as can get . 
  france , it 's such a diverse country and it 's close enough to explore by car . 
  no , there is a fair use policy included in the eu regulations for unlimited data packages . 
  if you have unlimited data you can probably use up to 10gb ( or some other maximum ) within the eu . 
  that 's something you will have to check with your provider . 
  this , i mean , can you imagine destroying the planet because * we were n't sure ... * ( though we really were ), 
  using data in another eu member state ( + iceland and norway ) will pretty much be like using data in your home country indeed . 
  my phone plan offers 7gb a month , which i can now not only use in the netherlands , but also in sweden , france or bulgaria . 
   most of the world would love to see you starve and struggle . 
  perhaps some sick idiots would . 
   this is why the world hates you . 
  europe has always put humanity first . 
  no , we have not , that 's a falsehood . 
  they now have . 
  most similar : new york city , jersey city and honolulu . 
  least similar : des moines , dayton and akron . 
  of course i did \u2661, 
  the [ lloyd 's building ] ( https://www.eyerevolution.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lloyds_building1.jpg ) in the city is pretty nice imo . 
  if he writes a dickens novel , perhaps he should be teaching you . 
  what about french , there 's no emphasis on learning french in flanders ? 
  edit : you must be walloon , never mind . 
  i would n't say it 's for the smartest kids , it 's just for those that are willing to go the extra mile and have an interest in ancient languages . 
  there 's plenty of smart kids that just do n't see any use in learning them . 
  there 's also a village called [ america ] ( http://www.americaweb.nl/kiekjes/dorp/r0012058s.jpg ) . 
  on november 22nd 1944 , british troops liberated america . 
  the people of america are forever grateful . 
  in new england , possibly massachusetts . 
   we 're not very good at it you 've been in the top 10 for three years in a row now . 
  slightly below average , 1.81 m. 
  * where groningen has multiple faculties but not in all fields . 
  i know what a faculty is ... 
   stayed in western europe [ we hold them dear . 
  ] ( https://www.tracesofwar.com/upload/9418170313164723.jpg ), 
  at the time belgium had a larger population than the netherlands if i remember correctly . 
  the poles that liberated our country would come back to occupy it , typical soviet . 
  `` liberate '' you sure you were n't just looking to expand ? 
  there was a question about single-payer , universal healthcare . 
  that 's because we have different cultural values , what americans might perceive as liberal would be considered centrist/neutral in europe . 
  someone who would want to get rid of universal healthcare would be considered an extremist here . 
  so when using an american political scale , we are mostly social liberals ( talking about western europe though ) , but using a western european scale there are many more ways to distinguish between political currents . 
  being pro-gay marriage is not even a political topic in the netherlands , it 's the norm , even the extreme right is pro-gay marriage . 
  if not denying climate change makes you a social liberal , this test tells very little . 
  things we hold as self-evident like climate change , universal health care and secularism are apparently up for debate on the other side of the ocean . 
  no wonder everybody here gets marked a social liberal . 
  pretty much yeah , although the male lead singer left to revive his [ solo career ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzirsbcrlzg ) . 
  [ kensington ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkmjcajaqug ) and [ the common linnets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pp0y9hdhz8 ) or [ ilse delange ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpzx38qe4pi ) ( lead singer of the common linnets ) in general . 
  never seen any stray dogs in the netherlands . 
  groningen offers 200 + different bachelor programmes covering all fields ? 
  where did i say right wingers are oppressed ?
