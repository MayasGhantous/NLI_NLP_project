  i 'm just saying that many people would think negatively of you for voting conservative/christian . 
  it obviously differs from faculty to faculty . 
  on campus it 's pretty much the same . 
  your `` professional '' juries give each other 12 points in eurovision !, 
  it has its pros and cons . 
  the fact we 're all interacting in english here is not because of britain , it 's because of america and having a lingua franca for one is pretty cool i 'd say . 
  maybe once every five years . 
  the lake view shot looks stunningly beautiful . 
  the old school of architecture looks like a wwii bunker . 
  a failed attempt to recreate [ chich\u00e9n itz\u00e1 ] ( http://chichenitzaviptours.com/images/chichen_itza_3.jpg?crc=3856448089 ) . 
  most breathtaking would be the market hall ( [ oustide ] ( https://www.mvrdv.nl/media/uploads/untitled-2 ( 3 \\ ) . jpg ) , [ inside ] ( https://www.sprout.nl/sites/default/files/field/image/markthal.jpg ) ) . 
  the ugliest building for me is the [ library ] ( http://media.nu.nl/m/988xrqbamq5n_wd1280.jpg/bibliotheek-rotterdam-ontruimd-dreigtelefoontje.jpg ) . 
  i guess that 's negotiable , jankees . 
  sure , you can have delaware if we get to take new york . 
   eastern and northern finland would be fun to give out to ** the highest bidder ** . 
  #gib back new amsterdam, 
  do you really want to border qatar in the future ? 
  vienna is a very good option though . 
  do n't necessarily agree though i would rule out very remote places like finland or cyprus . 
  no polish cities ? 
   rotterdam this city is far [ too modern ] ( http://www.firstrotterdam.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first_rotterdam_kantoren_uitzicht3.jpg ) to be the capital of the eu , great lack of historical buildings due to wwii , it will disappoint a lot of visitors and people that want to live/work in historic , bombastic , european environments . 
  it 's unique and impressive in its own way and i love living here , but it 's not a good representation of europe . 
  yeah , well i did n't invent it : /, 
  except for the usual fascist/nazi/communist / socialist/etc . 
  remarks , leftists/sjws are sometimes referred to as geitenwollensokken ( socks made of goat 's wool ) or bomenknuffelaars ( tree huggers ) . 
  labour class and right wingers are often called tokkies ( based on a [ tv reality show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd3gjqmkwy4 ) featuring the rude tokkie family ) or pvv ` ers ( wilders ' party ) . 
  we only have one airport that flies intercontinental so i would n't know . 
  i would restore the house of romanov in russia . 
  maybe once every two weeks , 200 grams . 
  i 'm not really into it . 
  civilised german , aka dutch . 
  there 's nothing wrong with poedersuiker , pannenkoeken and bloemkool !, 
  [ zierikzee ] ( http://hollandia.szallas-utazas-ajanlo.com/files/2014/05/zierikzee-is-a-small-and-ancient-town-in-zeeland-the-netherlands.jpg ) is not ugly :(, 
   it is not only trump . 
  that 's why i called it western hypocrisy , not american hypocrisy , though republicans are much more outspoken on the issue . 
   the ksa provides a strong ally both economically and geostrategically . 
  alienating them would be wrong depends on which values you adhere to . 
   does n't matter . 
  international relations do not work on ideology . 
  it is all about power and influence . 
  it is the reason the us is allied with the saudis . 
  it is the reason the soviets worked with the third reich . 
  it is the reason we are looking for deals with china . 
  realpolitik . 
  i seriously doubt saudi arabia would have severed its ties with the us if trump had n't called out iran . 
  to be honest , i think trump 's obsession over iran is not inflated by saudi arabia , he 's just genuinely ignorant . 
  perhaps not taking sides in sectarian islamic violence , because that 's what iran vs. saudi arabia is all about . 
  iran , which has now twice elected a moderate president that seeks to open up his country to the rest of the world , and the west in particular , gets called out for being a sponsor of terrorism , whereas saudi arabia gets to sign a 100 billion dollar arms deal . 
  both countries have awful human rights records , but women are much better off in iran than in saudi arabia . 
  it 's hypocritical to call is barbaric , but praise the same kind of regime a few hundred miles south . 
  and no , it is not like obama was any better , trump simply continues a long tradition of western hypocrisy . 
  you should go with better . 
  i agree that we have a lot of similarities with denmark , i noticed this when watching danish tv series , we just do n't share the same language :(, 
   is has nothing to do with nationality or cultural identity . 
  there are many historical ties though . 
  there 's a lack of wilderness and natural beauty as the country is overcrowded and highly urbanised . 
  you just stole ours and turned it 90 degrees , do n't make this prettier than it is !, 
  totally agree , the [ prinsenvlag ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cprs9itwgaanfly.jpg ) is more unique and historical . 
  well , let me say i definitely identify with flanders much more than with other parts of europe . 
  i sometimes follow flemish tv and news outlets , whenever i 'm in flanders there 's no linguistic barrier and in southern parts of the netherlands it is not uncommon to spot a lot of belgians . 
  however , apart from being small nations that share a lot of history , i do n't think there 's much of a benelux identity as such . 
  so apart from flanders i would say there 's no real difference between being in wallonia/luxembourg or in france/germany . 
  i hope they will , because there is no good reason not to carry your passport on you while abroad and travelling in and out schengen , especially as a non-eu citizen . 
  some people also try to justify islamic terrorism in the west , there 's no use in arguing with every stupid opinion in the world . 
  yes , faintly . 
  it does n't bother me . 
  ugh , you just ca n't let your children out of sight without them being exposed to english these days ...

  you ca n't deny colonialism also brought infrastructure . 
  you could argue this was used to exploit natural resources , but it 's not like africa ran out of natural resources before colonialism ended , far from it . 
  i do n't think it 's feasible because unlike post-war europe , in africa you 're dealing with warlords and corrupt politicians . 
  for foreign investment to thrive , you need law enforcement and ( long term ) stability . 
   and the biggest contributor to france in mali is usa and uk . 
  those with bigger armies contribute more , shocking . 
  that we smoke pot all the time , it 's only a few joints a day actually . 
  though understandable i 'd say that 's an undesirable proposal . 
  once you have agreed to take in migrants ( which you do if you do n't send them back ) , you do n't want them roaming the streets begging and littering . 
  [ there you go . 
  hilary duff also starred in some hollywood productions after that , but mostly chick flicks so it 's not really surprising you do n't know who she is . 
  could you stop being so extremely sensitive about your geographic denomination ? 
  only 19 per cent of estonians support taking in migrants , they fit the description perfectly . 
  it 's called a description for a reason . 
  they risk those sanctions because other european countries did n't dare stand up against germany and voted in favour of redistribution even though they were against forced redistribution . 
  that 's a great example of why countries that are against migration need to work together . 
  lizzie mcguire does n't ring a bell ? 
  that was a very famous tv show , even some movies were made . 
  some supermarkets actually started to advertise them by putting 9 of them in one box and calling them ` negen zoenen ' ( = nine kisses ) which obviously is n't much different from negerzoenen . 
  the original question was n't about them not taking in migrants either , but perhaps you only read the title . 
  what sanctions would you risk ? 
  you 're in nato anyway and simply trying to find a majority for a certain policy stance does n't warrant any type of sanction . 
  perhaps czech politicians should try to find allies * within * the eu to alter the policy of the eu toward migration . 
  i do n't think it is hard to find common ground on making deals with african nations , as i guess even most western countries are in favour of that . 
  you would expect countries that are so outspoken on migration to also perhaps make some policy proposals . 
  in the western world , people do n't really distinguish between eastern europe and central europe . 
  a lot of people just follow the iron curtain division . 
   they quota system is pushed exactly by the european commission , the commission does n't share v4 view at all . 
  my point is that you could try to alter the position of the european commission by seeking a majority within the european union for reasonable measures such as a turkey deal with african countries or a return to libya policy . 
  if that majority is reached the ec could then start negotiating the actual deals instead of individual governments ( although they could help ) . 
  it 's no secret most eastern european and some western european countries are not really keen on accepting refugees and this includes the baltics , romania and bulgaria .
