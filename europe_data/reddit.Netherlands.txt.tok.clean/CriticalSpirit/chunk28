  one should really be committed to a certain country in my view . 
  if you want to vote , you should go through the process of becoming a citizen ( and preferably abandon your old citizenship ) . 
  that sounds awfully mean , but maybe their personalities just did n't match . 
   if you would translate all of the songs on the radio you 'd get a massive cringe fest , people do n't really realize what they 're listening to and how stupid it would sound if they 'd actually think about it . 
  why do you think people do n't understand english songs ? 
  [ excuse me ? 
  we have no equivalent of area 51 or fort knox , but we do associate secretive things with the aivd , our intelligence agency . 
  on top of that , there 's the open secret that there are american nuclear weapons stored in volkel air base in north-brabant . 
  the government has never officially confirmed this rumour ( and still wo n't ) , but recently a former pm said it was true . 
  so ... did you guys just move further down the atlantic ocean , or did you , you know , drown the english ? 
  why is it an unpopular opinion , do the french not like belgians ? 
  ( apart from the belgians are dumb jokes that i know you french people are into as well . ), 
  yeah , would actually be pretty cool , it was once reality . 
  obviously the dutch caribbean islands , but within the european part of our country i would say flanders . 
   or was that a calm and friendly goodbye ? 
  [ for indonesia it was n't ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indonesian_national_revolution ) , yet indonesians seem to have forgiven us , they are usually not bitter at all about the past . 
  as for suriname , it was actually our government that initiated the process for them to become independent , they did n't ask for it ( silly labour government ... ) . 
  yet our immigrants are n't skilled , as we did n't select them like they do in australia , canada or the us . 
  furthermore , an immigrant here could potentially live on welfare his entire life as no-one will hire a worker that does n't speak the local language and shows no interest in wanting to work . 
   the average immigrant does n't go to school , so does n't take 15 years of taxpayer money . 
  that 's only the first generation . 
   in fact immigrants in the uk are the only group in society who do . 
  the average native briton needs to earn about # 50,000 per year in order to contribute more than they take . 
  this is well above the average wage of # 27500 . 
  whereas immigrants , both from inside and outside the eu , contribute more than they take . 
  i call bs , as immigrants form a minority , that means they must contribute far more than native brits for this to be true , that 's very implausible . 
  of course eastern europeans that settled in the uk specifically to work are more likely to work than native brits , they did n't settle in the uk because they liked the queen . 
  you should take them out of the equation . 
   ca n't find the source for the eu or the uk , but there 's a source here for the us : us immigrants ca n't be compared to the immigrants we have here . 
  the us is not a welfare state , of course they 're gon na have to work . 
  we have [ wild horses in the oostvaardersplassen ] ( http://static.zoom.nl/ee75f1e057c3e3d534723457a9eadc3f-paarden-in-de-oostvaardersplassen.jpg ) . 
  mountains are not the problem , a lack of winter is . 
  a tropical island does n't make for a great ski environment . 
  i would say afrikaans and german for most dutch speakers . 
  * i do n't trust him for one meter . 
  = i do n't trust him at all . 
   this will happen when the next labour government is elected to power . 
  not anytime soon that is . 
  by what country has turkey not felt offended though ? 
  you read my mind , amsterdam is n't friendly toward any form of traffic really . 
  we 're not * that * small . 
   i think the biggest benefit is that your nationality wo n't ever offend anyone abroad because your country is so insignificant in the world affairs . 
  that 's definitely true , and perhaps even more so for other small nations outside western europe . 
  very true . 
  if you are , you can not defend yourself . 
  germany decides to take over ? 
  you are defenceless , you are dependent on others to be independent . 
  as a child , extensive cycling infrastructure . 
  it 's completely absent abroad , with a few exceptions . 
  let 's not make this nuclear . 
  brexit in a few decades . 
  oops , it 's been a while ... 
  u.s. history was part of my final exam curriculum , mainly 1860s-1970s history . 
  wars , foreign policy , industrialisation , segregation and stuff like that . 
  theodore roosevelt 's fight against monopolies , jim * crow laws , franklin d. roosevelt 's new deal , assassination of john f. kennedy , opposition to the vietnam war in the 60s/70s . 
  * edit : jim not john . 
   what 's a ** non-european ** country you 'd like to visit ? 
  waiting for someone to say turkey . 
  i plan on visiting canada in the near future . 
  having already been to the us , i wonder whether it will be much different . 
   it looks like she 's talking about her far-right militants she was rather talking about her voters , i believe , who are mostly ordinary french citizens . 
  tourists visiting north korea are a welcome source of income and propaganda for one of the most cruel regimes in history , but i guess it makes for great instagram posts . 
  perhaps grayson is more common . 
  currently a [ new embassy ] ( https://www.atelierpro.nl/uploads/project/header/929089bda50e9104ee89ce06833cea27e3f6b56c.jpg ) is being built in wassenaar , a small town adjacent to the hague where the [ current embassy ] ( http://images0.tcdn.nl/incoming/article21936236.ece/binary/u/amerikaanse+ambassade.jpg ) which looks like a prison building is seated . 
  by the way , the us embassy in the hague was the first us embassy in the world , its first ambassador being john adams . 
  that building no longer exists unfortunately . 
  what about gray ? 
  some names : * fleur ( girl 's name meaning * bloom * ) * bas ( boy 's name meaning * bass * ) * jasmijn ( girl 's name meaning * jasmine * ) * ben ( boy 's name meaning * am * as in * i am * ) * famke ( girl 's name meaning * girl * in frisian ) * roos ( girl 's name meaning * rose * ) * iris ( girl 's name meaning * iris * ) * rozemarijn ( girl 's name meaning * rosemary * ), 
  honestly , i 'm quite sure that would not go down well for any european leader . 
  did you improve your english though, 
  france has france24 . 
  in my school there were n't as there were n't many religious people to begin with . 
  not even a thousand people . 
  that 's your average friday afternoon demonstration in italy . 
  it goes by unnoticed . 
  demonstrating just because it 's a tradition to do so on this day makes no sense to most people here . 
  the preparations for next week 's eurovision song contest . 
  well , i do n't want to dive into this too deep , but i would rather blame your electoral two-party system and the poor choice of candidates it delivered rather than the american people . 
  thank you for sharing your story , i just wanted to say that i do n't understand why anyone would downvote you . 
  i wanted to mention him , but did n't want to drag america into this , 
  turkey is mostly a threat to itself . 
  too many dumb people blindly following a ` strong ' leader who 's really just a pussy that ca n't handle criticism . 
  most beautiful ? 
  maybe not , but definitely one i like . 
  [ alane ] ( https://youtu.be/3gl5oez8j_o ) by the cameroonian singer wes . 
  what about wanker ? 
  it 's indeed because of the sun , my home has many large windows . 
  how do i survive ? 
  taking a cold shower two to three times a day , putting my feet in ice cold water , those kind of things . 
  it 's not the temperature that gets to you though , it 's the humidity here close to the sea . 
  makes it feel like a tropical rainforest when temperatures reach 30 + degrees outside . 
  your sweat wo n't evaporate . 
  on average , 22 degrees during winter and 27 degrees during summer time . 
  public space = hospitals , schools , public transport , government buildings , etc. 
  in the end numbers do n't really matter , i think americans would have been just as shocked had ` only ' 200 of their compatriots died on mh17 . 
  the senseless loss of life is what gets to us all . 
  2002 - assassination of popular anti-immigration politician pim fortuyn 2004 - assassination of director and islam critic theo van gogh 2008/09 - financial crisis/euro crisis 2013 - abdication of the queen of orange 2014 - downing of mh17, 
   nessie , the fucker wo n't even turn up 99.99 % of the time , total scam . 
  for a moment i thought this comment was still related to the comment about the red light district in amsterdam . 
  so is california .
