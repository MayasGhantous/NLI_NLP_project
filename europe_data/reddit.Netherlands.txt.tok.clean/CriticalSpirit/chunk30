  but people are quick to blend it in with germany and europe in general , which is not that bad , to them we 're not that different i guess . 
  usually it 's like : ` where are you guys from ? ', 
  ` we 're from the netherlands ' ` oh , my son went to austria once , how nice . ', 
  depends on context really , it 's not ` obvious ' that we 're talking about both european and african countries like some here claim . 
  very often it 's used as a synonym for southern europe , or more specifically spain , france , italy and greece . 
  i have yet to meet someone that would answer albania , lebanon or morocco if you ask them to name a mediterranean country . 
  holy ~ ~ shit ~ ~ empire, 
  germany , switzerland , austria and czechia . 
  i do n't have any particular reason why , it 's just how i regard them . 
  i guess slovakia and hungary are too far east for me , poland is just generally a synonym for eastern europe here and slovenia used to be part of yugoslavia which i never considered to be central european . 
  chances are your family tree is european , 
  no , it 's called retaliation . 
  nothing has ever come out of reports that proved assad used chemical weapons , and something tells me that even if they had responded to these reports of former attacks you would still be against it . 
  totally comparable , not . 
  fyi there are extensive reports with evidence that the syrian regime carried out chemical weapon attacks in the past , so it 's not some american conspiracy . 
  so despite the radar data and intelligence they probably got that tells them everything they need to know , they should wait for russia to oppose a un resolution , because then they 'll know for sure !, 
  again , makes no sense . 
  what kind of reasoning is that , you think he looks dumb for attacking because he did n't wait for russia to use its veto . 
  that makes zero sense whatsoever . 
  using a veto is not an implicit admission of guilt , russia will be russia and say the information is inconclusive or false . 
  for me that would be [ ghent ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@51.0539538,3.7205535,3a,90y,105.09h,86.45t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-1kvscr_qyuo%2fu1an0an_2xi%2faaaaaaaboaa%2f4xjam2ztlgolc1omzkgxxexc7nz3e1pjqcjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-1kvscr_qyuo%2fu1an0an_2xi%2faaaaaaaboaa%2f4xjam2ztlgolc1omzkgxxexc7nz3e1pjqcjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya201.30493-ro0-fo100%2f!7i10756!8i5378 ) .

  not d\u00fcrer 's [ melencolia i ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/d%c3%bcrer_melancholia_i.jpg ) ? 
  i do n't have a favourite , but i am particularly fond of [ the polish nobleman ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/rembrandt_van_rijn_-_a_polish_nobleman.jpg ) by rembrandt , as it looks like a depiction of a drag queen , rather than a high ranking pole . 
  not sure , perhaps starry night by vincent van gogh . 
   the dutch government is still kind of flirting with the subject in a more subtle manner slippery slope kind of way ( the `` right to die '' laws and welfare cuts have a kind of unfortunate intersection where , if the government fails to care for certain people and makes it virtually impossible for these people to live , then they can wash their hands and say `` well , for some reason those people chose assisted suicide , so ... there 's really no problem , is there ? '', 
  do n't go down that road . 
  even if that would somehow be a by-effect , it is unintentional . 
  all quiet on the eastern front ... 
  i would be fairly worried if you could get on a plane with invalid documents . 
  he 's probably got some european blood in his family tree anyway . 
  yeah , every year . 
  it 's kind of a small tradition to watch it either with my family or with friends , get some snacks and drinks , and simply enjoy . 
  i am not heavily invested in the sense that i desperately care if my country does well or not , but who would after 8 years of missing out on the finale . 
  it was taken without consent , it was later unwillingly handed over . 
  do n't compare those treaties to modern day treaties . 
  no , our empire was far too small to be of any real significance today . 
  belgium , same language , broadly the same history , same size , yeah no doubt . 
  why , colonialism was robbing , just because we did it too , does n't mean i have to agree with it . 
  the treaty of utrecht does n't change the fact it was a rob . 
  it is clearly british , but i would not take sides as i have sympathy for spain 's position , they were robbed after all . 
  these things happen in real communities as well . 
  even then , they 're still called ` community gardens ' as the owners of these private plots form a ` community ' . 
  probably the cultures you find in the balkan countries , turkey and the caucasus . 
  [ kralendijk ] ( http://www.tourismbonaire.com/public_docs/business/pending/downtown-kralendijk-1-xl.jpg ) , obviously . 
   do they have very short hair , are well bulit , and wear tracksuits ? 
  do n't all poles ? 
  my image of poles might have been slightly distorted . 
  there 's plenty of christians that have a cross tattooed and are n't bothered by the fact it was used as a symbol by the kkk . 
  those exact same groups use the current dutch flag as well when marching , that does n't make our flag a fascist symbol . 
  neither does isis using islam , make the crescent moon a fascist symbol . 
  nonsense , it 's not a fascist symbol . 
  i do n't really care about paying 50 cents for a decent toilet , i just hate it when they require coins . 
  who still walks around with coins in 2017 ? 
  some toilets accept sms/card payments though , that 's the future . 
  just bring a credit card ? 
  it 's been used and abused by right-wing groups for many different purposes which is why nowadays it has a slightly negative connotation , unfortunately . 
  it 's not entirely known . 
   the origin of the red-white-blue tricolour is not entirely clear ; some sources suggest that it developed merely as a variant of red-white-orange because the orange dye would tend to fade to red over time . 
  however , there have also been suggestions to the effect that the red-white-blue flag might predate the introduction of the prince 's flag in the 1570s . 
  thus , muller ( 1862 ) suggested that the colours were taken from the coat of arms of the bavarian house , the rulers of the county of holland during 1354 -- 1433 , who used the bavarian coat of arms quartered with the arms of the counts of holland . 
   during the early part of the first stadtholderless period ( 1650 -- 1672 ) , the government of the dutch republic wanted to appease the republican government of the commonwealth of england , and because the colour orange was associated with the house of stuart , the orange-white-blue prince 's flag was banned in 1652 , replaced by the red-white-blue `` states flag '' . 
  according to de waard ( 1900 ) , the dutch navy between 1588 and 1630 always displayed the prince 's flag , and after 1663 always the states flag , but both flag variants were in use during the period of 1630 -- 1662 . 
  it appears that prior to 1664 , the red-white-blue tricolor was commonly known as the `` flag of holland '' ( hollandsche vlag ) . 
  in 1664 , the states of zeeland complained about this , and a resolution of the states-general introduced the name `` states flag '' ( statenvlag ) . 
  that would be portugal for me . 
  i really like our [ former flag ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cprs9itwgaanfly.jpg ) as well , i would be in favour of switching back . 
  during euro 2016 , some people adopted belgium as their favourite team , but it was nothing widespread . 
   but zwarte piet as a visible manifestation of underlying social dynamics of ` first ' and ` second rate ' citizens , functioning as a stereotype that reinforces this dynamic , this is the real problem this is just a fancy way of saying essentially the same thing . 
  sinterklaas does however not represent white people and zwarte piet does not represent black people . 
  i do n't identify with sinterklaas , and black people should not identify with zwarte piet . 
   in this country , it seems , black people are only allowed to have an opinion if it does n't offend white people . 
  well if your opinion is that white people celebrating sinterklaas are racist , then obviously that 's gon na evoke some reactions , including unfortunately racist ones . 
  and i am pretty damn sure that people in suriname would react the exact same way if white inhabitants would insist the surinamese change their traditions , and rightfully so . 
  part of it is that giving up on zwarte piet is essentially admitting ` you were right , we were being racist bigots and celebrating slavery ' which is obviously not the case . 
  that some may perceive it to be a celebration of slavery is not everybody else 's problem . 
  i know right !, 
  with reading it 's pretty much the exact same speed , if there 's words i do n't know , it 's usually enough to look at the context . 
  writing takes a bit more time than usual as my active english skills have never really been well developed . 
  living in a non-english speaking country , i have never really been able to thoroughly practice my active english skills on a day-to-day basis . 
  i feel 100 % confident writing in dutch as it comes natural to me , writing in english , not so much . 
  after all , it feels like i 'm just repeating catchphrases i picked up from decades of consuming american/british media . 
  the dutch anthem is about how we 're loyal to the spanish king ... 
  almost the same in dutch as well , but just not quite ... * mijn hand is in warm water . 
  same with english-dutch . 
  i can think of dozens of sentences that are almost identical but have one or two words written differently . 
  * warm water is warm . 
  * same in dutch and english ( and afrikaans ) . 
  nonsense , great britain is the name of one island , if you want to use a shortcut , just say uk . 
  especially in this topic when you want to emphasise the difference between scotland and a country , it makes zero sense to use the wrong name . 
  the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland though . 
  except norway and denmark are considered separate countries because they are legally , politically , culturally and economically two different countries . 
  limburg in the netherlands might have more in common with limburg in belgium than say frisia up north , but that does n't make the two a country . 
  that 's a very bad comparison , rather say denmark and greenland . 
  spanish is also an official language in catalonia . 
   it is an absolute horrible bitch to find a residence here , well i guess that also depends on which city you want to move to . 
  amsterdam is obviously more expensive than rotterdam . 
  eu flags are usually only seen on embassies , european institutions like europol and some government buildings in the hague . 
  in rotterdam the flag frequents our city hall .
