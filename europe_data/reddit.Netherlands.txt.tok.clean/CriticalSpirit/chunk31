   it might not be that the customer is going to a shop of a foreign country cross-border shopping happens all the time along the border . 
  my favourite european landmark ? 
  probably the [ colosseum ] ( http://images.mapsofworld.com/travel-blog/facts-about-the-colosseum-in-rome.jpg ) in rome . 
  the [ erasmusbridge ] ( http://static.zoom.nl/547801fa58eb90fd4496245589cac541-erasmusbrug-by-night.jpg ) holds a special place in my heart though . 
  democracy , freedom of press , freedom of expression , freedom of religion , but perhaps more uniquely a strong sense of solidarity . 
  this means universal health care , expansive welfare systems and a focus on battling poverty . 
  they remind me of the [ sofa ] ( https://http2.mlstatic.com/sofa-club-vip-verde-habboes-provincial-y-venezuela-d_nq_np_266521-mlv20809551835_072016-f.jpg ) from habbo if you know what that is . 
  well this is the eli5 version , obviously the actual process is more complicated and also for example includes a request for advice from the council of state . 
   regardless , i do think people overrate their english ability . 
  yeah , to me it seems that in general our passive english skills are extremely well developed , except perhaps for some obsolete vocabulary that can often be found in literary novels . 
  however , writing but especially speaking in english and doing so fluently can be a challenge . 
  sure i can hold a conversation and i will understand my discussion partners , but i still find it hard to construct long and eloquent sentences without thinking about them first . 
  i 'm always embarrassed when i suddenly have to switch to english and sound like a first grader , knowing i can do better . 
  i guess this can only improve if you really speak english on a daily basis with other ( preferably native ) speakers . 
  a bill can be proposed by either the government or an mp . 
  it needs to pass the [ second chamber/parliament ] ( http://media.nu.nl/m/bs6xg0maymns_wd1280.jpg/tweede-kamer-stemt-in-met-terughackwet.jpg ) (  50 % ) which has 150 seats . 
  the bill is signed by a minister and the king and enters into force . 
  are you supposed to know all variances , how do you know you 're not getting fooled ? 
   i think dutch is usually v2 too , sometimes switching to vf ( verb-final ) , right ? 
  i guess that 's right . 
  do we all know what v2 and svo mean ? 
  not according to [ this poll ] ( https://yougov.de/news/2016/01/28/leicht-wachsende-mehrheit-fur-legalisierung-der-ho/ ) ( 61 % cdu voters in favour ) . 
  it 's less worrisome than i thought though . 
  it seems to be 60 % overall . 
   60 % of the liberal german muslims support gay marriage  40 % of the highly religious german muslims support gay marriage are these supposed to be positive numbers ? 
  they 're far too low knowing conservative muslims form the majority . 
  liberals are the exception . 
  perhaps in germany it 's more acceptable to hold this view as you do n't even allow gay marriage . 
  not from belgium , but my grandfather was sent to germany during wwii to work in the war industry and my grandmother 's house was heavily damaged during a bombardment after which she had to pick the bodies of her neighbours from the rubble . 
  her brothers were also sent to germany and her uncle was sent to a concentration camp ( where he died ) for insulting a high ranking officer . 
  both have resented germany for the rest of their lives really , but they never transferred any of that hatred onto their children or grandchildren . 
  as the war generation is slowly passing away , there are less and less people that regard germany with animosity . 
  why would apple adjust its prices to local disposable income ? 
  should it sell iphones at $ 20 in congo ? 
  it makes me less used to driving long distances , but not less open . 
  i have no problems with driving 10 + hours a day , but it 's not something i do on a regular basis . 
  are you moving to a small village up north where they 've never seen a foreigner , if not do n't worry . 
  if your name had been jihad or allah that could be a reason to change it , but aladdin should not get you into trouble . 
  all the time , there are quite some dutch people of surinamese and caribbean descent living in the netherlands . 
  they are among the best integrated communities in the netherlands . 
  our small country has twelve provinces and i will group them according to cultural resemblance , this is purely based on my personal opinion . 
  * groningen , drenthe and frisia : our northern provinces , frisia has its own language and is known for its lakes and islands , groningen is known for its gas fields and drenthe for its monolithes . 
  the people are generally referred to as being ` down to earth ' . 
  * north holland , south holland and utrecht : these provinces form the economic core of our country , they include schiphol airport , the port of rotterdam , the government seat in the hague and our capital amsterdam . 
  the area is commonly referred to as the [ randstad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/randstad ) . 
  * north brabant and limburg : our catholic provinces , people are known for having a more soft way of pronouncing the g-sound . 
  limburg has some hills . 
  they celebrate carnaval and are home to some well respected breweries . 
  * zeeland : lot of wind and water . 
  this is where the battle against the sea is fought day in day out . 
  * overijssel and gelderland : castles and farmland , do n't know much about them , sorry . 
  * flevoland : this province was reclaimed from the sea in 20th century , it 's our youngest province and houses a lot of people that fled the randstad . 
  it has some [ amazing wildlife ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixxeefbtmxa ) as well . 
  [ for those who do n't know about the cohesion policy . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/faq/ ), 
  gr\u00fc\u00dfe zur\u00fcck aus [ holland ] ( https://www.holidayguru.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/colorful-oranjestad-aruba-istock_000054802770_large-2.jpg ) !, 
  it 's pretty hard to mistake most european cities for a non-european city though . 
  obviously elizabeth is an overpaid eurocrat that we never elected in the first place !, 
  preferably denmark . 
  the sub is officially bilingual . 
   it 's the closest language to english another advantage is that if you learn dutch you will also be able to understand german and especially afrikaans to a certain extent . 
  scotland ? 
  well , there 's a dutch version of [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pgpq4fgwfk ) and it has the exact same dance , although the dutch version has no music video . 
  i found [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgda9el956e ) though , it 's belgian . 
  and a lot of children grew up with the [ ` kabouterdans ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ywv4pwqk4 ) from flemish tv . 
  i was taught uk english by an american teacher . 
  i speak english with a very generic accent i would say , neither truly british nor american . 
  i really ca n't think of anyone . 
  [ vengaboys - we 're going to ibiza !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxxrhpved3m ), 
  i think you 're an idiot . 
  honestly , people complaining about the loan system either do n't get it or are just jealous . 
  it 's a perfectly fine system . 
  i 'm not sure whether there 's an official name , but we often refer to our flag as `` het rood-wit-blauw '' ( the red-white-blue ) . 
  among other things . 
  my prediction for tomorrow : party | seats ( out of 150 ) --------- | ---------- vvd | 27 cda | 21 pvv | 21 d66 | 16 groenlinks | 18 pvda | 12 sp | 15 christenunie | 5 sgp | 3 pvdd | 3 50plus | 5 denk | 2 fvd | 2, 
  if little under 52 % votes to leave , that 's not a strong mandate to pretty much cut all ties with europe , as a significant part of that 52 per cent must have thought they could stay in the common market ( as they were told by many proponents ) . 
  it would be silly to think that of that 52 % everyone wanted a hard brexit . 
  that means a majority would want a soft brexit ( those who voted remain + those who voted leave but wanted soft brexit ) . 
  hahahaha , even nigel farage was all about keeping free trade with the european union . 
  well may decided it had to be a hard brexit , while the results clearly gave her a mandate for soft brexit . 
  depending on the severity economic and political sanctions would be imposed on turkey . 
  i ca n't think of any way turkey could physically attack us without violating the integraty of dozens of other countries . 
  well that would be [ even more hypocritical ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_the_ottoman_empire ) . 
  yeah , there 's no way one could occupy the us , there 's more guns than citizens . 
  not sure whether that would be different in other countries if they 'd be armed like that . 
  freedom !, 
  do n't worry , it 's english humor , omg i can read italian !, 
  is this some new sort of error shaming ? 
  no waiting lists , but you pay twice as much . 
  [ not kidding ] ( https://www.mercatus.org/sites/default/files/chart%201%20small_1.png ) . 
  i travel half the country on a regular basis , i call it my daily commute . 
  in dutch we have ` het zal me een worst wezen ' , literally ` it 'll be me a sausage ' , meaning i do n't really care . 
  oh no , it was just a bad joke . 
  i could n't care less ? 
  well , what did salad tell her ? 
  perhaps it 's best if you call the centre and ask them your questions directly . 
  i am certain they 'll be willing to explain the procedure to you and if not , you did your best . 
  if it actually did cost you money and they do n't know your insurance data , they will probably bill you directly and you can then probably claim that amount from your health insurer . 
  at least that 's how it would work in the netherlands .
