  i remember they were part of our history class in primary school . 
  never seen one , but i have always been intrigued by them . 
  btw : it 's eerie , not eery . 
  val dood - drop dead . 
  stik d' r in - choke in it . 
  i think some of these 90s hits have been quite popular abroad : * [ 2 unlimited - get ready for this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvtm_bhzdoe ) * [ 2 unlimited - no limit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkexggdqmz8 ) * [ vengaboys - boom , boom , boom , boom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llyiq4i-mcq ), 
   thuisbezorgd ( dutch aggregator app for food delivery services ) it 's kind of worrisome you use that app on a daily basis . 
  uitkeringstrekker , literally benefit puller . 
  i would be surprised if they had an obligation to send it to a foreign country . 
  # \\ #apartheid # \\ #triggered, 
  and see the polish economy collapse , no i would n't want that . 
   `` really ? 
  you want to see the eiffel tower ?!? '', 
  -- said no parisian ever . 
  dozens of these prehistoric [ dolmens ] ( http://www.hunebeddenwijzer.nl/wp-content/uploads/d27groot.jpg ) can be found in the province of drenthe . 
  and perhaps in time , after things around brexit have become more clear and you might even have gotten married , you can both move back to the uk . 
  no , you should get yourself a visa or mastercard . 
  if it 's within a korean context , it should n't be seen as offensive . 
  if you would take this to europe and start telling a german he looks like a gestapo it 's a different story . 
  swearing and hand gestures are not at all common in traffic , unless it 's about giving way to each other . 
  sure , we may all have our moments , but they 're not hardwired into our culture . 
   i love going to germany , so being able to ** just take a ferry over ** real quick would be wonderful . 
  that still sounds like a big hurdle . 
  the kingdom does , but indeed not in europe . 
  i would n't switch any though i would support integrating belgium in the netherlands and france , if they 'd support that . 
  there 's no flood ? 
  not in romania that is . 
  there has definitely been a large influx of eastern europeans into my region , which i do n't mind though . 
  they 're hardworking people . 
  then i 'll be frank , i think you 're an oppressor of mankind . 
  i only ever met two portuguese immigrants and i do n't have an opinion of them other than that they were nice and decent people . 
  in your opinion it is . 
  honestly , i do n't see how your view is any different from the way saudi-arabia is run . 
  just a different denomination . 
  why ca n't people just let other people be , why do you feel a need to enforce your ways on others ? 
  no , i do n't mind . 
  although i must say i have never felt the need to correct non-native dutch speakers , unless they were explicitly in the process of learning dutch . 
  in my experience , most people know their english or dutch is not perfect and they are more or less aware of the mistakes they make , they just feel it 's exhausting to constantly rephrase and correct themselves . 
   i wish he was a christian fundamentalist like cruz to be honest . 
  what 's the difference between a muslim fundamentalist and a christian fundamentalist ? 
  the muslim tries to terrorize you with bombs , the christian with laws . 
  i 'm imagining a bunch of kids with more than cringey accents thinking they kick ass . 
   to be fair the ~ ~ french ~ ~ europeans were n't exactly fond of him either, 
  because our public broadcaster needs to attract young viewers , so they started allowing broadcasting associations to air on platforms like youtube . 
  they already made this kind of content on tv for over ten years , but now it 's also online and it got picked up by foreigners . 
  a channel about drug use being sponsored by the government . 
  i think the english language sounds very pretty and musical . 
  drugslab must be the most stereotypical dutch yt channel out there . 
  it does , and i think an advantage of the dutch language is that it contains so many different sounds that we have little difficulties pronouncing certain sounds in all kinds of languages that are alien to most other monolinguals . 
  `` throat cancer '' is a common description . 
  people are not really fond of our guttural g and to be honest , neither am i. 
  it sounds harsh and ugly , almost arabic . 
  i could start speaking with a soft g like they do in belgium and the southern provinces in the netherlands but that would be conceived as weird by my compatriots . 
  beautiful , and i 'm stuck here with endless [ flat meadows ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/14484877.jpg ) . 
  in the netherlands we have non-stop weekly polls and i think they 're a great way to uncover trends , but they should not be taken too seriously . 
  okay , well you made it seem like you meant staying in barcelona for twelve days was n't enough , but i see you meant the region of catalunya in general . 
  but you do n't have to stay put at one place for two weeks , i mean , sure staying somewhere for a longer period of time is nice , but staying in barcelona for 5 days is fine for most people . 
  12 days for barcelona is not enough ? 
  are you rich or what ? 
  yeah , just the music , i 'm not into their personalities . 
  i like [ sexion d'assaut ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7-vp7tnluy ) . 
  well there 's this nice duet between [ lionel richie and trijntje oosterhuis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgix31ammc ) . 
  a more recent example is [ breng me naar het water ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfexebcvdv0 ) by matt simons and marco borsato . 
  not an official collaboration but i think a unique performance is that of [ to make you feel my love ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nevcuscnpvo ) by paul de leeuw and adele . 
  no , he 's not a great singer , but not so long ago , adele was a regular guest on his show on dutch tv . 
  i mean , could you imagine seeing that happen today ? 
  i did n't . 
  that 's understandable yet sad at the same time . 
  good you 're still friends . 
  did you know that the us spends about 20 % of its gdp on health care services and that most countries that have universal health care only spend 10 % of their gdp on it ? 
  the american system makes it easier for healthcare providers to charge insane costs , spend lots on commercials and lure people into treatments they do n't need . 
  in the netherlands universal health care is financed by : a ) fixed premiums paid to insurance companies ( approx . 
  $ 100 a month ) , low-income groups are compensated by the government b ) an income dependent contribution of 6.95 % ( capped at an income of $ 52,000 a year ) , levied via income tax c ) everyone has an obligatory deductible excess of $ 385 , but this does not apply to gp visits and medicines so if you 're poor and jobless , all you have to pay is up to $ 385 and that 's only if you use special health care services . 
  if you 're rich , you maximally pay approx . 
  $ 4,700 a year + the $ 385 deductible . 
  you can , of course , always opt for additional insurance but that 's up to you . 
  i 'll be reporting this traffic light since it should be flashing orange if there 's low traffic during nighttime . 
  okay , did n't know that , thank you . 
  sorry that i have to be the german here , but what 's the joke ? 
  the fact that they 're driving away from tallinn ? 
   though i am not entirely sure the locals ' english is brilliant they 're currently in spain , anywhere else will be an upgrade when it comes to english comprehension . 
  as you said there are no such things in the netherlands , apart from makro/hanos but those are only open to entrepreneurs . 
  why not ? 
  i think that learning at home by watching tv , reading books and using the internet is a key element of learning a new language . 
  not in general , but i did one time hear someone say dallas pronouncing the first ` a ' as * awe * and ` las ' as * laws * . 
  that 's kind of the dutch way to say it , but it sounded off . 
  what ? 
  that 's just not true . 
  are they really underrated though ? 
  there 's millions of people ( mostly from other eu countries ) that visit the french countryside , it 's one of the most popular destinations for northern europeans . 
  i indeed call it an ` en-teken ' . 
  * [ haarlem ] ( https://mediabank.valkenhorst.nl/imagebank/images/20/image24204/c340x940.jpg ) , [ utrecht ] ( http://utrecht.ondernamen.nl/content/29485/news/clnt/3640726_1_org.jpg ) : these two kind of look alike and they 're also pretty similar to amsterdam . 
  they are nice if you 're looking for a more quiet atmosphere as they 're not over-run by tourists . 
  * the hague : the dutch seat of government . 
  it includes the [ king 's office ] ( http://images0.tcdn.nl/binnenland/article26115247.ece/binary/original/eid_noordeinde_komende_zomer.jpg ) , the [ houses of parliament ] ( http://www.omgevingindepraktijk.nl/sites/default/files/binnenhof-en-hofvijver-den-haag%5b1%5d.jpg ) and lots of international organisations including the [ international court of justice ] ( http://www.vredesloopdenhaag.nl/media/384440/vredespaleis.jpg ) . 
  the borough of [ scheveningen ] ( http://images0.tcdn.nl/binnenland/article24286608.ece/binary/original/pier+scheveningen+nieuw.jpg ) also makes for a nice stroll along the coast . 
  if you 're going to visit the hague , you should also take the 10 minute train ride to [ delft ] ( https://www.shopkaart.nl/cms_data/contents/baps/media/winkelgebieden/delft%20630x400.jpg ) , a [ beautiful ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/rm11901_delft_-_stadhuis.jpg ) and lovely town , home to the [ new church ] ( http://www.vanhoogevest.nl/imanager/media/6438/367201/nl/sec/img-8162klein.jpg ) where the royal family is buried and birth place of painter [ johannes vermeer ] ( https://kalden.home.xs4all.nl/verm/view/images/mauritshuis-viewdelft-det.jpg ) whose * [ girl with a pearl earring ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/meisje_met_de_parel.jpg ) * can be found in the [ mauritshuis ] ( http://s.objectuur.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/03_mauritshuis_luukkramer.jpg ) in the hague . 
  * rotterdam : this city is [ unique ] ( https://www.ms-fotografie.nl/wp-content/gallery/5848/5848-item5.jpg ) , [ modern ] ( https://www.flexas.nl/sites/default/files/object_pics/kantoorruimte_huren_aan_de_weena_762_in_rotterdam_5.png ) and unlike anything else in the netherlands ( and much of europe ) . 
  if you 're not into this kind of architecture it will not be your thing though . 
  * antwerp , bruges , ghent : all three are fantastic cities , and you should ( in my mind ) at least pick one of them .
