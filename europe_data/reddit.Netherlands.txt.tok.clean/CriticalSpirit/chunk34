  not a single person from a certain country ever entering the country no matter the reason ) , but i am confident there 's a majority in favour of restricting migration from islamic countries for example by means of imposing a quota on migration . 
  you 're not going to find many on reddit , or in amsterdam , but in the country as a whole , yes . 
  no , there are some republican activists , but there 's no serious debate about abolishing our monarchy . 
  i do n't think any political party in parliament would support that , neither would the population . 
  whatsapp is king in the netherlands , text is still used when you 're sending something to a stranger , or when you or the other person do n't have internet access . 
  unlimited text packages exist , but most do n't need them . 
  thanks . 
  is n't the first one pronounced as in ` soup ' whereas the other is pronounced as in ` you ' ? 
  different sounds that exist in english as well right ? 
   would you exclude all muslim-majority countries or just those that have a history of radicalism ? 
  all . 
   would it be complete , or would skilled workers on blue card or self employed programs still be allowed in ? 
  skilled , moderate workers would still be allowed in . 
   would you cancel existing visas , up to people who are already in transit ? 
  would you apply it to tourists too ? 
  no , i would n't and i would n't apply it to tourists with valid visas . 
   would you apply it to christian , hindu , and other minorities from those countries ? 
  yes . 
  can you give an example of that ? 
  mona lisa becomes la joconde , 
  not * putain * ? 
  never had any problems shitting except for the toilet bowl being completely filled with water . 
  at first i thought they were clogged , but apparently it was normal . 
  dacia , because it was cheap . 
  there are no gender pronouns in finnish ? 
  belgium and luxembourg , the history of the low countries is deeply intertwined . 
  apart from that i would say indonesia and suriname , mainly because of how they influenced the composition of our population today . 
  south africa and namibia have been important for the spread of dutch/afrikaans . 
  well i was and that 's what he said , period !, 
  # \\ #alternativefact, 
  you were there ? 
  well i trusted the american government , they said they had intelligence that hussein was producing wmds and chemical weapons and was perhaps even planning on using them . 
  if that were the case i would be okay if someone intervened . 
  after all , saddam hussein * was * a tyrant to his people and he had previously invaded kuwait . 
  however , the american government either lied or was lied to by its agencies . 
  if i had the correct information i would definitely not have agreed with the invasion , back then i was indifferent . 
  louis bonaparte , who was crowned king of the netherlands by his brother napoleon bonaparte in 1806 , in an attempt to show the dutch people he wanted to be their king , and not just their ruler imposed on them by the french , famously said : `` ik wil uw konijn zijn . '', 
  in dutch that means `` i want to be your rabbit . '', 
  he wanted to say : `` ik wil uw koning zijn '' which means `` i want to be your king . '', 
  despite all this he became fairly popular among the dutch population , especially after he visited the victims of the leiden explosion in 1807 , sent soldiers to remove the rubble and donated money to a disaster fund . 
  i really ca n't say because we 're not in that situation . 
  it would be rather pretentious to say they absolutely would n't . 
  our constitution was created in 1814 after we regained independence from the french , but is has been under constant revision ever since . 
  [ can confirm . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7ilmtq2wq ), 
  [ oh well ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z2zx_oabsy ), 
  is his swedish any good ? 
  i read he migrated to sweden when he was 13 years old . 
  d66 : that they 're not tough on islamic migration . 
  i pretty much agree with everything , but sometimes they 're a bit too liberal for me , i do n't like the way they appease islam . 
   his anti immigration view points had nothing to do with him being shot . 
  he was definitely shot because of those views , not because he had supposedly harmed animals . 
  the killer was a left-wing extremist who did n't like the way pim fortuyn talked about muslims . 
  wilders has been under constant bodyguard protection since the killing of van gogh , so has hirsi ali , although she moved to the states after the incident involving her nationality . 
  i do n't care about the superbowl . 
  besides , i could n't tell you much about pms pre - and post-wwii . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2igyvh7hzo8 ), 
  there has been more snow in the eastern parts of the country though . 
   i do n't think there are any active disputes currently . 
  not that i 've heard of . 
  there is an [ active border dispute ] ( http://www.knipselkrant-curacao.com/dh-france-breached-border-status-quo-agreement/ ) between france and the kingdom of the netherlands on the island of st. martin . 
  i would say the murder of anti-immigration politician [ pim fortuyn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assassination_of_pim_fortuyn ) in 2002 and subsequently the murder of popular islam-critic [ theo van gogh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theo_van_gogh_ ( film_director \\ ) #murder ) in 2004 . 
  the purpetrator attached a note to his stomach saying mp [ ayaan hirsi ali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ayaan_hirsi_ali ) would be next . 
  there is a reason wilders has been doing well ever since . 
  you 're not a direct target , does n't make it a fine place . 
  some of my all-time favourites , it 's really hard to pick just one song : * [ tracy chapman - fast car ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orv_f2hv4gk ) * [ michel fugain - une belle histoire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2uhqahlc2y ) * [ zaz - eblouie par la nuit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdcgopup2nc ) * [ the corrs - so young ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzltf69vqos ) ( pretty much everything by the corrs ) * [ the cranberries - ode to my family ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz-djr1qs54 ), 
  this is what i remembered , i think most people know these lines . 
   sang the french anthem ( `` allons enfant de la partie '' ) instead of the belgian one . 
  ouch . 
  europe should seek peace with every nation and region including china , but i do n't see why we should be in a military alliance . 
  i do n't , but it 's perfectly possible to live cashless without much ado . 
  the eu could , making nukes does not involve magic spells only france and the uk possess , we do n't because we signed agreements not to . 
  in the unlikely case of nato collapsing and the uk/france becoming hostile or isolationist toward the eu , we could consider making our own , but i do n't see it happen anytime soon if at all . 
  it should only happen if the eu has full competence concerning foreign policy and perhaps a more centralised defense . 
  whatever happens , you just ca n't defend the fact that europe has two permanent seats whereas india , japan , latin america and africa have none so either one has got to go . 
  the european union should be in the un security council , not france and the uk . 
  [ eva jinek ] ( http://media.nu.nl/m/m1mx9ueanh6w_wd1280.jpg/eva-jinek-begint-tweede-seizoen-met-bijna-600000-kijkers.jpg ) is a well-known dutch tv host of czech descent . 
  `` rebels '' do n't possess buk missile systems or russian passports . 
  it will , wilders has been a devoted trump supporter so if trump goes full retard that will stop people from voting wilders , if trump does well it 's the other way around . 
  in the us you know for certain that your ancestors are foreigners , over here you can be 90 % sure your ancestors are mostly from within the region your parents came from . 
  perhaps you would like to share what you already know about your ancestors ( without giving away your identity ) so we could go from there . 
  right now i would give the political stability of my country a 9 . 
  elections are coming though and after the elections we will most certainly go back to 6 . 
  the polls indicate tough negotiations will be necessary to form a coalition . 
  parties are alienating themselves from each other which makes coalition building very hard . 
  i doubt there will be an enormous crisis though , that would be very un-dutch . 
  obviously i do n't know your preferences , so i can only give you a very broad itinerary : amsterdam - brussels - paris - barcelona - cannes/nice/monaco - milan - florence - rome - venice - vienna - prague - berlin, 
  if the nobel prizes would only be awarded to swedes , they would n't have as much prestige as they have now . 
  not allowing in ( new ) refugees is one thing , detaining green card holders is another . 
  i mean , has he lost his mind ? 
  also , why is iran on that list , but not bloody saudi arabia ? 
   considering trump is the new hitler i assume we will have to kill him ? 
  they no longer teach history in schools ? 
  my high school teacher was an american , but he was well integrated in dutch society , he had learnt to speak dutch fluently . 
  at a university it 's no big deal if you do n't speak dutch , but elsewhere it 's pretty important you know the language of your host country . 
   dutch : pfad . 
  what ? 
  amsterdamse bos perhaps . 
  if i were you i would n't visit corsica on this trip . 
  it 's expensive and time consuming to get to and off the island .
