  perhaps you would enjoy visiting cannes , nice or monaco instead . 
  why are you so agitated ? 
  it 's not a problem if it 's only one or two comments . 
  besides , you could also tell him or her in a more gentle manner . 
  i support unity within the uk , but would have accepted independence for scotland . 
  i think it 'd be a disgrace to not allow scotland into the eu if it were to become independent . 
  before the referendum i did n't know there were such strong nationalistic feelings in scotland , although i knew about the labour/tory divide with england . 
  i actually do n't think we need to fear the french elections . 
  even if le pen wins , i do n't think the french will vote out , i think it 's more about migration than the eu , much like the unite ... :(, 
  something that will never stop to amaze me is the fact that i can make day-trips to places like brussels , london , cologne and paris . 
  each city being completely different from the other . 
  as a small nation , we just ca n't deny the importance of europe . 
  montpellier is a nice city , i remember standing [ here ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@43.6113014,3.8689899,3a,85.4y,181.35h,84.06t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-_hvly24eyyy%2fv6qph3flogi%2faaaaaaabi1i%2fu9cs50sgqmojb9irx-_-mn3ntyo4iewcaclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh3.googleusercontent.com%2f-_hvly24eyyy%2fv6qph3flogi%2faaaaaaabi1i%2fu9cs50sgqmojb9irx-_-mn3ntyo4iewcaclib%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya87.10971-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i10000!8i5000 ) and overhearing a french guy say he could see the sea from there , and indeed you could !, 
   me explaining hacker philosophy in a video made for schools . 
  making it was an interesting experience . 
  i think you did a great job explaining the difference between the good guys and the bad guys in hacking :d, 
  die museumsinsel alone makes it worth a visit , and berlin has such an interesting history which is visible throughout the city . 
   the netherlands has no law against genocide denial , but the courts have ruled that such a statement is a form of hate speech . 
  pathetic . 
  being an idiot should not be illegal . 
  [ mine 's so cute !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqw4w9wgxcq ), 
  in what way ? 
  then it 's more or less the same . 
  we have majors and minors in the netherlands , i 'm not certain whether it 's the same though . 
  [ not kidding ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/11488633.jpg ) . 
  the hague less so , but still to a [ certain degree ] ( http://www.merkdenhaag.nl/sites/default/files/styles/homepage_grid_image/public/skyline%20den%20haag%20-%20foto%20arjan%20de%20jager,%20den%20haag%20marketing_0.jpg?itok=8xksw8xj ) . 
  but it 's not very popular in other cities , as it does n't really go well with the historic inner cities . 
  another winter issue : the low sun blinding you . 
  i could totally see myself live in a city like london ( 45 minute flight home ) . 
  since that will no longer be possible i would opt for a city like copenhagen , hamburg or goteborg . 
  i like living near the sea . 
  do employers allow workers to take a long mid-day break ? 
  what i consider to be the worst is waking up , commuting to my work in total darkness , working indoors , and commuting home in total darkness . 
  your mistake is to assume that only direct experience is relevant in a discussion , do you know what bias is ? 
   i roll my r 's , and once i said something about `` room thrrree '' [ for reference !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2my1nz4usqs ) got ta love maggie smith 's accent . 
   do n't wan na work , i wan na eat pork . 
  these lyrics hit deep man . 
  nl : [ scandinavisch model ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavisch_model ), 
  never heard of this , sounds quite strange actually . 
  a non-binding referendum can easily be arranged by the government though . 
  true , in the netherlands you can either say it the english way , or the dutch way ( instagggggrahm ) . 
  make sure you stress that g. 
  you can always prematurely renew your id to get the electronic card . 
  it would suit you though if you 'd do the same when visiting smaller countries that are `` not even comparable '' . 
  french is not that easy that learning some sentences by heart will give you the ability to easily understand spoken french . 
  well if you live in moscow you might see them on quite some embassies . 
   and use of french is more widespread than dutch or slovenian , it 's not even comparable . 
  so do you speak german in germany ? 
  beautiful square , streetview is from 2011 though so perhaps it 's a tiny bit more common today . 
  you should visit catalunya , 
  it 's not a very common sight here either and some people might feel uncomfortable seeing it , but tearing it down is quite drastic ( and frankly quite obtuse behaviour ) . 
   i lived 8 months in your country ** in overijssel ** and many time people could not speak english figures . 
  i agree with most of what you 're saying and i have n't had any bad experiences in france . 
  some people genuinely do n't speak english but are willing to communicate in ` low-level french ' for me and others are willing to switch to english if you start off in french . 
  in touristy areas , english is no problem at all . 
  like you said , if they ca n't understand you , they 'll get you someone that will . 
  i 've had more difficulties in eastern europe , italy and spain to be honest . 
   `` you are not really free in europe at all '' is complete nonsense , but of course there is a reason why your father left the netherlands . 
  some people do feel suffocated by the dutch mentality , which emphasizes practicality and consensus over vision and competition . 
  your father 's remark `` here [ the us ] u are allowed 2 shine '' certainly hist the spot . 
  does n't have an american equivalent . 
  i definitely think this is what he was alluding to , but it 's obviously wrong to generalise that to all of europe . 
  but this is one-way traffic , or are you suggesting that the french follow language courses before embarking on a holiday trip ? 
  if someone from france speaks english to me , i do n't think that 's offensive , i acknowledge the fact one can only speak so many languages fluently . 
  when i 'm in france i always attempt to start the conversation in french , but that 's because i 've had  6 years of french classes , you ca n't expect everyone to have that sort of base . 
  because everyone in the world is making an effort to learn english to better understand each other . 
  as if french people abroad attempt to speak dutch or slovenian . 
  not speaking english is one thing , thinking tourists should know your language is obnoxious . 
   your country overal is shit . 
  you 're making a fool out of yourself . 
  get off the internet , you 're drunk . 
  when an italian has an accent it 's ` cute ' , when a dutchman has an accent it 's insufferable . 
  you want to shoot a bunch of teenagers for being stupid ? 
  what are two guards supposed to do against an angry mob of teenagers ? 
  university gatherings usually do n't require extensive protection . 
  this is a very controversial subject in the us , so please do n't judge us if we appear ignorant . 
  from what i know blm basically has two divisions : peaceful protesters , and annoying sjws . 
  i encourage people in general to speak out against police violence ( against blacks ) , but they should do so peacefully , not by rioting and looting . 
  i strongly despise the more extreme activists though . 
  the ones that make a living out of victimizing themselves . 
  take for instance , al sharpton . 
  a well respected reverend , until he started showing up every time a black life was taken , no matter the cause . 
  or the activists that disrupted bernie sanders ' rally , the kind of people that will not rest until white people are absent from political life and see racism in pretty much everything a white person does . 
  the worst kind are the ones that will just [ kill any kind of debate and shout stuff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unobt8te13g ) . 
  you never push all three together , what 's the problem ? 
  why do n't need a neutral language , we need one that works . 
  honestly , i never understood it either ... 
  yeah , i think we are no different than america in this . 
  you do n't have to be overly proud of your country , sure you can even be very critical of it , but this kind of self-hate serves no-one . 
  i actually salute the fact you 'll be renting a car . 
  i think that 's a great way of travelling , especially for short distances in the benelux/germany . 
  depending on your preferences you could visit ghent , antwerp , rotterdam or the hague on your way to amsterdam . 
  * ghent - very beautiful , historic inner city . 
  * antwerp - beautiful as well , but more or less similar to brussels . 
  * rotterdam - [ uniquely modern ] ( https://www.flexas.nl/sites/default/files/object_pics/kantoorruimte_huren_aan_de_weena_762_in_rotterdam_5.png ) for a european city , might feel a bit american to you , but perhaps that 's not what you 're looking for on a trip to europe . 
  * the hague - seat of the dutch government so lots of ministries , the houses of parliament and the king 's office . 
  if you go there , do n't forget to visit the borough of [ scheveningen ] ( http://images0.tcdn.nl/binnenland/article24286608.ece/binary/original/pier+scheveningen+nieuw.jpg ) with its beach and boulevard . 
   kopen means ` to buy ' , koper means ' ~ ~ person who buys ~ ~ buyer ' it 's not that different in english .
