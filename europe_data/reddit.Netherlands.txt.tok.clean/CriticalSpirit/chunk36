  vtm nieuws ( belgium , 0:54 ) sounded like they were going to announce the new pope . 
  tvp wiadomosci ( poland , 9:02 ) felt like the intro of a movie . 
  out of sight , but not out of mind . 
  if all ( and i literally mean * all * ) your encounters with a certain group are them begging or stealing from you , you 're inclined to have a negative view . 
  are there any sentiments in ireland to follow the uk ? 
   even though my personal political convictions are very different to hers . 
  reading the rest of your post i honestly doubt that . 
  [ never forget .

  go to your nearest dutch embassy . 
  if that were the case he would have written `` european irish '' . 
  imagine the inhabitants speaking swedish as their mother tongue , would be funny . 
  and airport weeze is not d\u00fcsseldorf ... 
  no , i have never but i know some that have . 
  bonaire , cura\u00e7ao , saba and especially aruba are popular tourist destinations , not the least among americans . 
  for me it 's simply too far to be feasible , i would rather spend my money on a trip to the states or canada . 
  i have always found it mind boggling that you can speak dutch in south america , even though the largest dutch speaking community ( suriname ) is no longer part of the kingdom . 
  it 's also weird to more or less be able to call venezuela a neighbouring country as three of the islands are pretty much adjacent to the venezuelan coast . 
  size , not being out of the country after driving more than 2 hours . 
  of course , [ serving in one of the overseas territories is a treat ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/512230099622457345/yfhebmum.jpeg ) !, 
  i think it would be cheapest to * fly from los angeles to london ( $ 650 ) ; * fly from london to amsterdam ( $ 50 ) ; * fly from amsterdam to berlin ( $ 60 ) ; * fly from berlin to barcelona ( $ 60 ) ; * fly from barcelona to florence ( $ 70 ) ; * fly from florence to london ( $ 90 ) . 
  that would mean around $ 1,000 per person for flying alone . 
  however , this would be exhausting and an inefficient way of spending your money . 
  if i were you i would focus on one region ( i.e. 
  eastern europe , central europe , italy , scandinavia , western europe , etc. ), 
  and perhaps rent a car or travel by train to cover the short distances . 
  some itineraries i would recommend : * berlin - prague - vienna - budapest - krak\u00f3w ( auschwitz ) . 
  * london - amsterdam - brussels - paris . 
  maria is a pretty popular name in the netherlands ( 4.5 % of women ) , but even more popular as a middle name ( 15 % of women ; 6.8 % of men ) . 
  [ this map ] ( https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/verspreiding/naam/maria ) shows the distribution of maria as a first name among women in the netherlands . 
  it seems to be slightly more popular in the catholic south than the protestant north . 
  its popularity has been decreasing over the years though : in 2015 only 0.3 % of girls born was named maria . 
   i am not here to argue for the first amendment ( van de nederlandse grondwet natuurlijk ) . 
  neither am i , and that 's most certainly not what this is about . 
   widers was recently found guilty of inciting discrimination . 
  it 's debatable whether this should be punishable by law . 
  the judges more or less admitted that what he meant was n't racist or discriminatory , but by simply not providing enough context his words were . 
  wilders is an instigator and fool for pulling such tricks , but in no way harmful toward racial groups . 
  yet people that vote pvv are not necessarily racist or homophobe and frankly you should n't be implying that . 
  the loire valley in france has [ nice castles ] ( http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/travel/destination-images/france/loire_valley/1400-hero-loire-valley-france-chateau-chenonceau.imgcache.rev1420831258860.web.jpg ) and [ scenery ] ( http://www.theaa.ie/travelhub/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/loire-valley.jpg ) . 
  i 'd say they are pretty much the same although we do n't put emphasis on generations before the baby boomers . 
  i 've never seen anyone group pre-war generations like that , we simply talk about the generation that ` went through the war ' ( born before 1935 ) . 
  you must know that the baby boomers in the netherlands also experienced economic fortune ( average economic growth of 5 % between 1950-1973 ) , mainly because of the marshall plan and the rapid population growth . 
  very stereotypical , but perhaps sizes and portions . 
  an american would call medium what a european would probably call large . 
  i was mainly talking from my experiences in flanders . 
  literally ( and therefore sometimes purposely incorrectly ) translating dutch sayings into english is actually a big thing in the netherlands . 
  some examples : * make that the cat wise . 
  ( you 're lying . ), 
  * i do n't trust you for a meter . 
  ( i do n't trust you at all . ), 
  * i keep you in the holes . 
  ( i keep an eye on you . ), 
  * he fell with the door in house . 
  ( he cut straight to the point . ), 
  * nothing on the hand . 
  ( it 's all fine . ), 
  * it will be me a sausage . 
  ( i do n't care . ), 
  * that looks me strong . 
  ( i doubt that . ), 
  i personally think it 's great they come , but i do n't live in amsterdam and people there complain it 's become a total tourist trap . 
  his grandfather was also german . 
  best of both worlds . 
   most ~ ~ italians ~ ~ tourists go to the netherlands only to get high . 
  ftfy . 
  at home being ? 
  belgium actually exists and has some of the most beautiful inner cities in europe . 
  i wish we never broke up . 
  young people no longer speak german , and that has only ever been a thing in the eastern part of the country . 
  you could earn money by shortening your trip . 
  do n't spend money you do n't have . 
  twenty-five days is still plenty of fun . 
  if done well it can be really pretty , i especially like the first picture . 
  yeah they do . 
  that 's why you mostly see them at the edge of cities , not in the city centre . 
  impressive !, 
  yeah it 's confusing : /, 
  * ik zag twee beren broodjes smeren * ( i saw two bears butter bread ) * o dat was een wonder * ( o that was a wonder ) * ' t was een wonder boven wonder * ( it was truly miraculous ) * dat die beren smeren konden * ( that those bears could butter [ bread ] ) * hi , hi , hi , ha , ha , ha * * ik stond er bij en ik keek er naar * ( i stood idle and just watched ) -- this is a dutch song everyone will know , but it does n't make much sense ... 
  looks nice , especially considering your population size . 
  the rotermann quarter reminds me of a [ building complex ] ( https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7348/10516551245_8880cd22b6_b.jpg ) ( [ 2 ] ( https://www.woonzorg.nl/uploads/projectimage/titel/_cols4_3/23/23a50a8e26015db88d6aad851a314d05.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3773/10516745003_2f248f543a_b.jpg ) ) we have in rotterdam which is also built in a kind of industrial style . 
  nicely lit at night . 
  is that orange building new ? 
  i do n't remember it though i remember walking passed that gherkin like building a few years back . 
  curious about you being curious about the netherlands , why so curious ? 
  i 'm not saying i 'm against putin , or that i dislike russia , but to pretend russia is a functioning democracy is quite a stretch . 
  there 's a crackdown on ngos , independent media outlets , journalists and anti-putin opposition members . 
  of course he does n't give a damn about even more extreme opposition leaders , they 're no real threat to him . 
  just like moderate republicans would n't fight tea party republicans . 
  again , russians are probably glad to have putin , just like most people in china might also be happy with their form of government . 
  does n't make it democratic in the european sense . 
  was there any serious opposition ? 
  you 're not a democracy if opposition leaders are constantly getting killed by mysterious men . 
  i wonder who i can blame for selling new netherland to the british ... 
   he dressed like a woman [ fabulous !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/louis_xiv_of_france.jpg ), 
  am i right to assume you wo n't stop in every country and that some countries will just be ` drive-through ' destinations ? 
  that would make it a lot more interesting and doable . 
  if you have a debit or credit card and enable international banking ( or at least european banking ) , you could simply use this card to pay or get money from an atm . 
  i 've been doing this for years and i never stress over bringing enough money on a trip .
