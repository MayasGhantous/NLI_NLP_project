  it also automatically converts currencies for you , which means you can just as easily pay in british pounds even though your bank account is filled with euros or any other currency for that matter . 
  of course it 's still necessary to bring at least some cash , because you will not always be able to pay using your card . 
  this was in no way an attempt to be funny . 
  as a 16 year old you will have trouble booking a hotel room , but less so booking a train ticket . 
  combine that with your itinerary and it only made sense that you 'd be using night trains . 
  one must always be careful judging historical figures , but i 'm not really judging him . 
  i 'm not saying that the dutch were a harmless peaceful people that were oppressed by hateful spaniards . 
  i 'm not even surprised he 's considered a hero in spain , that only makes sense . 
  from a spanish perspective he was probably a great heroic warlord that defended spanish interests . 
  from a dutch perspective however he is probably the most hated nobleman to have ever ruled the netherlands . 
   i am aware of it , i wanted to have a nice paris trip but because of my age , visa and accommodation was a problem , this was my only choice are you going to sleep in night trains instead of hotels because of your age ? 
  if so , be aware that you wo n't always have proper shower facilities available and that might be something you 'd want to check in advance . 
  the killing of thousands of people in naarden is not based on hearsay or folklore . 
  it 's not only in some doubtful dutch sources . 
  the [ third duke of alba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fernando_%c3%81lvarez_de_toledo,_3rd_duke_of_alba ) , or known in the netherlands as the ` iron duke ' . 
  he was sent to the netherlands by spanish king [ philip ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philip_ii_of_spain ) in 1567 to extinguish any form of calvinism and to suppress any form of resistance against the spanish rule . 
  alba ordered the execution of 1100 men . 
  local leaders that had n't been hard enough on the protestant population were decapitated in brussels . 
  he introduced an extra tax to finance the spanish war efforts : the dutch were essentially paying the spaniards to suppress them . 
  the dutch started a civil war ( [ eighty years ' war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eighty_years%27_war ) ) against the spanish oppressor . 
  the dutch were awaiting support from the french huguenots , but their leaders were mostly killed during the [ st. bartholomew 's day massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._bartholomew%27s_day_massacre ) so support never arrived . 
  alba was therefore able to regain control over some parts of the low countries and as a form of punishment executed the entire population of [ naarden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naarden ) in what would become known as the [ naarden massacre ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/wreede_moordt_der_spanjaarden_tot_naarden%2c_den_eersten_december_des_jaars_1572_-_the_cruel_massacre_of_naarden_by_the_spanish_in_1572_%28jan_luyken%29.jpg ) . 
  ` not a child was spared ' he would report to king philip . 
  happy end note : we eventually won that war and became the [ dutch republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_republic ) , one of the , if not * the * most prosperous nations of its time . 
  jumping from the frying pan into the fire . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  why would that be ? 
  is it against eu law and values that germans are far less well represented compared to estonians ? 
  i indeed did n't mean the council . 
  for the council you could perhaps work with representation without voting power or a rotating seat for the smaller nations . 
  malta is definitely a borderline situation . 
  what i described does change the situation , it gives the population of san marino the power to vote for italian meps . 
  yeah , but switzerland is not in the eu so that would be rather problematic . 
  sure , they can become members , but they should not be granted veto-power or separate representation . 
  it would be ridiculous to grant 30.000 people a seat in the european parliament , let alone in the european council . 
  san marino could vote with italy , monaco with france , andorra with spain and liechtenstein with austria if they were to become members . 
  i consider western-russia ( including moscow ) to be part of europe , also cyprus ( even though it 's geographically in asia ) . 
  ukraine is also definitely part of europe . 
  i do n't consider kazakhstan , georgia , turkey , azerbaijan and armenia to be part of europe . 
  this is just my personal opinion , and actually in no way relevant . 
  being in or outside of europe is not of great importance , there is nothing wrong with being in asia for example . 
   cheap labour , and income tax revenues from said work . 
  that 's what . 
  we could get that from workers from within europe as well . 
   just like all immigrants , in all places in all times - they simply look for a chance of a better life . 
  i 'm not disputing that , but frankly that 's not a reason to allow them in . 
  not at all actually . 
   dont believe the right wing media that likes to paint them all as either scroungers/beggars or terrorists . 
  right wing media ? 
  it 's just reality that migrants bring with them crime and costs . 
  that 's not necessarily tied to their origin , but to the position they 're in : not knowing the language , having a different culture , low social-economic class . 
   got proof ? 
  or are you just repeating the right wing press ? 
  i do , [ this ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/31/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand ) is a press release from our statistics agency stating that over half of somalis ( 68.9 % ) , iraqis ( 57.8 % ) , syrians ( 62.2 % ) and eritreans ( 50.2 % ) are on welfare as opposed to 3.1 % of dutch nationals . 
   remember that those with pending asylum cases are not allowed to work until their case is granted . 
  if you have n't been granted a residence permit , you 're technically not on welfare ( so not included in the stats ) , you instead receive pocket money from the immigration center where you currently stay . 
  but driving in the end is beneficial : the pros outweigh the cons . 
  what has mass immigration brought to europe ? 
  most people that come are on social welfare , do n't ( yet ) speak our language and bring a growing , conservative religion . 
  and that 's without taking crime and terrorist attacks into consideration . 
  i do n't feel the pros of mass migration outweigh the cons , it 's not beneficial and even counter productive if we want to help genuine refugees . 
  prices in shops : differs , but mostly $ 1,99 large numbers : 1.000.000 decimal places : 1,23 quotation marks : `` these '' are both \u201e okay '' . 
  perhaps , but if he does bad , there 's an opportunity to impeach him or elect someone else after his first tenure . 
  we do not sympathise with leaders , we sympathise with ordinary americans , and that will not change , that 's what 's most important . 
  though you 're a troll , i 'll comment to let other americans know we will have to await trump 's actions . 
  it would be silly to turn our back on an ally over one president , let alone over one that might not even be that bad . 
  the danes actually held elections during the war ? 
  denmark for it 's very similar to my own country : small , flat , fantastic cycling culture , `` interesting '' language . 
  especially in words like * sixth * . 
  i can confirm that it 's indeed illegal in the netherlands . 
  it was a nice drive through , from what i remember it was very green and had nice forests . 
  really enjoyed my stay . 
  if you want nice views , warm temperatures and a relatively low cost of living , i 'm afraid you wo n't come far in the netherlands . 
  have a great time anyway !, 
  the airport , also visited the steven f. udvar-hazy center ( technically not in loudoun , but in fairfax county ) . 
  north : [ gullfoss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gullfoss ) , iceland - 64 \u00b0 20 'n south : arlington county , virginia , united states - 38 \u00b0 51 'n difference : 25 \u00b0 69 ' east : prague , czech republic - 14 \u00b0 28 ' e west : loudoun county , virginia , united states - 77 \u00b0 28 ' w difference : 91 \u00b0 56 ' highest :  2,000 m either in the alps or pyrenees . 
  lowest : ca . 
  -10 m around nieuwerkerk aan den ijssel , the netherlands, 
  never if we do n't want this to be a successful tactic , but i 'm sure that even if it were to become argentinian , those people could stay ( and become argentinians ) . 
  or short : macey . 
  for a moment i thought you meant naming my children after european countries ... 
  we use the following dutch names and their abbreviations . 
  the last one has become very uncommon though . 
  in general people know about the denomination ` daesh ' , but they wo n't use it themselves . 
  i ca n't believe they actually wanted to sort this by letting the people they put on the isles ` democratically ' decide who they want to be part of . 
  as if argentina would just drop its claim , because the brits want to remain british . 
  the `` idiots '' carried the vote , and might be more average than you think . 
   ~ ~ everybody ~ ~ intellectuals were talking banking passport , single market , freedom of movement , trade deal , wto shedules and eea rights during and after brexit . 
  joan and bob were talking migration . 
  merkel was the last straw . 
  merkel 's policy decisions caused brexit , but sure we 'll continue to praise her as the stable factor of the west . 
  i can think of some : * rotterdam : rotjeknor * utrecht : domstad ( because of [ the dom ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._martin%27s_cathedral,_utrecht ) ) * eindhoven : lichtstad ( because of [ philips ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/philips ) , licht = light ), 
  we have that very same favourite occupation in the netherlands , but we actually do send crap most of the time , or did i should say , things have started to change for the better since 2013 . 
  they just did it for the $ 5.000 travel and expense allowance . 
  not necessarily difficult , but different is the fact that adverbs end with - ly . 
  in dutch you would just say : `` she sings beautiful '' instead of `` she sings beautifully . '', 
  king william , so a w-sign ... 
  usa over australia , new zealand , canada and ireland ? 
  true , our figure is without apartments though , if you include these it would be 120 m \u00b2 ( 1,290 ft \u00b2 ) . 
  still bigger than the uk .
