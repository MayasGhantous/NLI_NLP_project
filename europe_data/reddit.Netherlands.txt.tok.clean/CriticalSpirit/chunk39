  [ germany ] ( https://img.rt.com/files/news/31/2f/b0/00/merkel-2.jpg ), 
  [ the netherlands ] ( https://vriendsinlowplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/amsterdam-147.jpg ), 
  `` former bp \u2122 of sealand '' seems suitable . 
   the island is not connected historically to the pacific nation of new zealand , which is named after the dutch province of zeeland . 
  just to set the record straight ... :d man , the royalties they pay are enough to cover the entire budget of zeeland . 
  we will veto until they [ change their name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zeeland ) . 
  because there 's a large islamic minority here that on top of that lives quite segregated from european society ( unlike the us for example ) . 
   the uk has jaywick which is probably worse than many places in moldova even though our country is very wealthy . 
  those pictures look like an average hungarian village though . 
  if that 's the worst you 've got , it 's not that bad . 
  that 's a unitary state though , not a federal state . 
  most proud : not something that is specific for my country , but the amazing infrastructure : efficient roads , public transport , waterways , airports , harbours . 
  i 'm always amazed how even some pretty remote places are accessible with public transport . 
  least proud : the way * some * ( ! ), 
  of us look at eastern europeans . 
  it 's not so much racism or hatred , it 's more like ` they 're taking our jobs and they cause trouble ' so i do n't like them . 
  although i 'm not an eean myself i do think it 's has gotten better over the last few years . 
  perhaps it has or had to do with the economic crisis , people losing their job and ( wrongfully ) thinking they 're being replaced by poles . 
  could also just be ` unknown , unloved ' . 
  i know right , why australia but not egypt , what could possibly be the reason ... / s, 
  is there a specific reason the czech republicans ( / s ) are so upset about this new name ? 
  no , i did n't actually . 
  you forgot to come up with a substantive response though , why do n't you give it another go ? 
   do you believe your countries will survive as european states in the following century ? 
  yes , but we might evolve into one european state . 
   does the importation of millions of third world people concern you ? 
  yes it does . 
  i would lie if i said it does not . 
  the numbers are far too high to make proper assimilation feasible . 
  people might take offence or ridicule you , but the lebanon scenario is not that far off . 
  perhaps not in 2040 or 2060 , but i see it happen in the coming centuries and one day people might wake up and ask themselves ` how did it come to this ' and they 'll have us to blame , because we thought we were n't going to be lebanon or worse , we thought it was wrong to even question migration . 
  are we ? 
  seems only logical , it 's singular in dutch as well . 
  did it pay well ? 
  j/k rofling not to be confused with the famous writer, 
   is it true that there 's porn being shot on the streets all the time ? 
  * is it ? 
   she was very critical of islam and ~ ~ was ~ ~ is one of the inspirations of geert wilders . 
  fortunately she has n't been killed ( yet ) . 
  the netherlands to netherland . 
   i do n't think that 's limited to places with universal healthcare , it 's a pretty universal complaint . 
  it 's actually the reason we abolished the publicly funded health care system in the netherlands and switched to a more market-oriented system with private health insurers but done the right way . 
  it still guarantees universal access and is payable for everyone , but it lacks the long waiting lists . 
  the system creates an incentive for health providers to work efficiently and for pharmaceutical companies to charge low prices for medicines or face non-coverage . 
  ` dead ' , but not covered in snow yet i think . 
  as for the pictures , anytime after 4:30 pm would do . 
  the sun goes down between 4:00 and 5:00 pm . 
  well from what i remember it was crowded , but doable . 
  entering the space beyond the bookcase really does something to you , because it 's such a well-known yet chilling place . 
  [ le trocad\u00e9ro ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@48.861992,2.288872,3a,75y,157.78h,88.1t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-jfiqtmp1fj4%2fuzirnhxmu3i%2faaaaaaaapmi%2fa4w5kxuhtnmpocrlpnwzpqq1vl_k2pfigcjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh3.googleusercontent.com%2f-jfiqtmp1fj4%2fuzirnhxmu3i%2faaaaaaaapmi%2fa4w5kxuhtnmpocrlpnwzpqq1vl_k2pfigcjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya65.356064-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i11700!8i5850 ) offers a nice view on the tour eiffel . 
  definitely visit montmartre , including le sacr\u00e9-coeur which offers yet another [ fantastic view ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_fna0bv8p3w/uil9xczwuui/aaaaaaaaahy/kgx30rv83oc/s1600/view+from+dome+of+sacre+coeur+12.jpg ) overlooking the city . 
  one of my personal favourites is visiting [ la d\u00e9fense ] ( http://goista.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/melia-paris-la-d%c3%a9fense-the-site-of-the-grande-arche-one-of-paris-most-modern-landmarks.jpg ) , the business district . 
  you 're lucky because the rijksmuseum , van gogh museum and stedelijk museum are all in the same place !, 
  it will totally depend on how long the lines are , but i would definitely plan an entire day for visiting the museums . 
  if you 're into modern and contemporary art you should visit the [ stedelijk museum ] ( http://www.stedelijk.nl/en ) in amsterdam . 
  you ca n't leave amsterdam without having visited both the [ rijksmuseum ] ( https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en ) ( dutch golden age paintings , including rembrandt van rijn , johannes vermeer and jan steen ) and the [ van gogh museum ] ( https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en ) ( biggest collection of van goghs in the world ) . 
  also if you 're interested in wwii history , you could visit the [ anne frank house ] ( http://www.annefrank.org/en/ ) , but do n't do it if you 're not in the mood as it can be quite depressing . 
  i speak dutch natively and english at an advanced level . 
  my next best language would be french meaning i can read french news papers , and hold a simple conversation in french , but that 's about it . 
  in school i learned dutch , english , french , german ( just 2 years ) and latin . 
  german is very similar to dutch so understanding german is doable even after only studying the language for 2 years . 
  i also feel pretty comfortable conversing with german speakers on holiday , because even if i myself can not speak german very well , understanding the other person is usually not a problem . 
  my vocabulary in french is greater than in german , but because of the similarity i can fall back on my dutch vocabulary . 
  main conclusion of this topic is that the internet has not yet reached the french speaking peoples . 
  i think he meant to stress that it 's part of the eu , not that 's is a synonym for it . 
  mensch is also old dutch , but yeah let the germans have her . 
  that 's the council of europe , the european council * is * an eu institution . 
  do n't they use proportional representation for referendums ? 
  m. / mr. / dhr . 
  = mevrouw mej . / juf = ( me ) juffrouw ( not very common though ) meneer stems from mijn heer ( my lord ) and used to be the way of addressing your landlord or a nobleman . 
  mevrouw stems from mijn vrouwe ( my lady ) and used to be the way of addressing a sovereign lady or noblewoman . 
  mejuffrouw/juffrouw stems from mijn jonkvrouw ( my young noblewoman ) and is used to address a preschool teacher , but could also be used to address an unmarried woman , but that 's rather unusual nowadays . 
  each time i visited a major european city as a tourist so at least once a year . 
  these are the kind of people that come to your car , start washing your windscreen ( windshield ) , and if you do n't pay break off your wipers . 
  down tourist sites they come to you asking you to sign a petition while an accomplice [ steals your wallet ] ( https://ejbron.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/screenshot_180.png ) or it turns out you signed to donate something and they start intimidating you . 
  they 're never up to any good .

  let me add two more recent bands : * kensington ( [ war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkmjcajaqug ) , [ heading up high ft. armin van buuren ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2c2v3kac08 ) ) * chef ` special ( [ in your arms ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlqfjg1uiac ) ) bonus track : * [ lil kleine & ronnie flex - drank & drugs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swivbesd50 ), 
   dj music electronic dance music ( edm ), 
   the only problem is i have n't found too many unis that offer economics courses in english . 
  pretty much all master programmes ( except things like dutch law ) are entirely in english in the netherlands and most universities offer bachelor programmes both in dutch and english . 
  some examples : * [ erasmus university rotterdam ] ( https://www.eur.nl/english/bachelor/programmes/ibeb/ ) * [ university of amsterdam ] ( http://www.uva.nl/en/education/bachelor-s/bachelor-s-programmes/item/economics--business-economics.html ) rotterdam has a highly acclaimed economics faculty , but amsterdam has better ( international ) student life . 
  both bachelors are entirely taught in english , and have about 50 % international students . 
  in the end it does n't really matter , because amsterdam and rotterdam are a 30-40 minute train ride apart . 
  same in the netherlands , but really what can we do ? 
  invade syria , risk the lives of millions , because a group is stuck in a part of the city ? 
  sadly , there 's nothing we can do but demand a political solution and call for both parties to respect the ceasefire . 
  it 's probably because literally all romas i have encountered tried to scam me . 
  well that totally depends on the circumstances , but we can not accept chaos at our border , so we should probably intervene to stop an influx of refugees and the rise of terror organisations . 
  `` both inspired by ( ... ) and germanic culture '', 
  depends on what you mean by celebrating christmas . 
  yes i think it would be weird for an atheist to visit the church on christmas eve , but there 's no direct religious connotation to spending time with your family , exchanging presents or putting up a christmas tree . 
  that 's just culture , both inspired by christianity and germanic culture . 
  as far as i know there 's no such term used in the netherlands . 
  not the uk though ... * `` excuse me , i am so sorry to interrupt you , but could i please very sincerely ask you if you would be so kind as to pass me the salt ? 
  '' * - `` sure thing , mom . '', 
  netherlands - `` cut the crap '' : get real , do n't beat about the bush . 
  dutch nouns do have genders , it just does n't have many consequences whether a noun is male or feminine . 
  it does matter whether it 's neuter or not .
