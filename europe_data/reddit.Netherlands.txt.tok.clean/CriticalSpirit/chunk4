  and guess who did n't restrict migration from those new members to the uk , even though most other eu members did . 
  it 's not that bad on those pictures , pretty much what we have here as well . 
   do n't worry though , i understand that canadians can have trouble with the concept of `` heritage '' given that their country is less than a hundred years old . 
  unnecessary . 
  if he was really that keen on donating his organs he would have registered , apparently he has no problems with the possibility of not donating in the end . 
  those are eu-citizens . 
  why would this be an eu affair ? 
  let countries decide for themselves , thank you . 
  never oppose logic . 
  so would it be for poor africans in peaceful countries , but why would it be a european value to help every poor person on earth in europe ? 
  is this common ? 
  i mean we do n't really strike up conversations either at a bus/tram stop , but we do not distance ourselves from each other . 
  it 's a logical deduction . 
  war is the primary reason you left your country , but it 's not the primary reason you want to go to western europe . 
  besides , they 're not fleeing from war , they 're looking for free wealth . 
  jeder , der den zaun \u00fcberwinden will , muss mit dem schlimmsten rechnen . `` this just makes me think he 's out of touch with reality . 
   we should never have done the eastern enlargement i disagree , but we should be more careful who we let in from now on . 
  only countries that are politically , economically and culturally ready to be in the eu , nothing less . 
  what value ? 
  taking in millions of non-eu ( economic ) migrants has never been a european value . 
  america-bashing , false accusations , and multiple fallacies in a post of a few sentences . 
  well done . 
  `` economists warn eu of exodus ahead of major tax ruling . '', 
  on a more serious note : `` brexit minister invites corporations to settle in the uk , vows to abolish corporate tax . '', 
  but brexit voters were promised more powerful vacuum cleaners :o, 
   `` norway does n't have the charge so why should we ? 
  i challenge the home secretary to rule it out . '' because norway is part of schengen . 
  what a dumb question . 
  they 're not football fans , they 're mentally ill sickos . 
  reading the wiki article , one thing amazes me . 
  in 1988 you were determined to replace the pillar by a new artistic artefact , a design competition was held . 
  seriously , out of all entries [ this ] ( http://www.mimoa.eu/images/12224_l.jpg ) hideous pole won ? 
  [ this painting ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/battle_of_gibraltar_1607.jpg ) of us destroying your vessels in the 1607 battle of gibraltar is quite glorious in our history , which in that time pretty much evolved around the dutch revolt . 
  i did actually use google translate to translate the name of the square in warsaw !, 
  nah , not really . 
  but hey , you have [ this ] ( https://iocarpm.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/acropolis.jpg ) . 
  yeah , and some nationalities did n't exist either , but i just went with modern names/nationalities . 
  [ look what i just found ] ( http://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/athens.jpg ) :d i do n't know why i did n't find that earlier on , sorry . 
   the most popular attributed cause is the rise of closed cars and other transportation . 
  as covered cars became more popular , the necessity for a hat diminished . 
  with low roofs meaning you could n't wear a hat while driving and generally had no need to cover your head anyway , personal transport often negated the need for headwear . 
  [ * source * ] ( http://www.esquireme.com/style/why-did-men-stop-wearing-hats ), 
  i enjoy other cities outside of the continent as well . 
  there 's plenty of history around the world , and even the modern american cities are worth visiting . 
  that being said , europe really is beautiful . 
  what happened in 1843 ? 
  yeah , i figured that , but i do n't speak many languages , let alone eastern-european languages haha . 
  i 've spent quite some time on lisbon , but could n't find anything that resembled the other paintings . 
  perhaps i should have searched in portuguese . 
  it helps if you know a portuguese painter , so you can simply browse their paintings . 
  that 's how i found some of the other paintings . 
   paris one looks a bit disappointing comapred to others yeah , it does stand out , not my best pick . 
   also vilinius , lithuania by the same author who painted warsaw great painting , i was just searching for ` painting vilnius ' on wikimedia commons and google , could n't find anything decent . 
  perhaps because their capital was not in it . 
  i 've tried my best to get as many as possible , but for some capitals i could n't find paintings that resemble the others . 
  feel free to post them in this thread though . 
  what do you mean ? 
  [ dutch paintings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_golden_age_painting ) can be found all around the world . 
  they 're in the metropolitan museum in new york , in the louvre in paris , pretty much everywhere !, 
  his style vaguely reminds me of [ jeroen bosch ] ( https://www.google.be/search?q=breugel+painting&amp;num=30&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjmjl-zn4xpahvewhokhyeubhiq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=987#tbm=isch&amp;q=jeroen+bosch+painting ) born in 's - hertogenbosch in the 15th century . 
  back in the days , the low countries were much more intertwined . 
  breugel was born around breda , but painted in antwerp en died in brussels . 
  future generations can consider themselves lucky , they get to see sharp imagery of over centuries ago . 
  we should , however , consider ourselves lucky as well for already having these beautiful paintings . 
  imagine being born in 200 b.c. , now that would be a boring time for a historian . 
  the painting shows the hofpoort near pompenburg , which was removed by the end of the 19th century . 
  the water was closed to ease up the traffic . 
  in 1940 , obviously , it was bombed to the ground . 
  [ this is what it looks like today . 
  ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/1337693.jpg ) that 's also the reason why this square is called hof ( poort ) plein . 
  yes , he did . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  that was actually my initial idea , but i was so amazed by all those paintings , that i did n't bother with the modern equivalents . 
  indeed , but fortunately our winters are still cold enough to skate on natural waters , at least every 5 years or so . 
  it 's still very popular . 
  google willem koekkoek , his paintings look like pictures from a different century , very cool . 
  there are so many beautiful paintings , this is just a very tiny collection . 
   if he 'd said yes , the story would be `` west midlands police force refuses to let muslim officers wear burqas and niqabs '' instead . 
  which would have not been controversial whatsoever . 
  it 's about the hair colour . 
  * red . 
  * divided into two parts . 
  * rich . 
  * not part of nato . 
  * so dumb . 
  * so fat . 
  * so religious . 
  * men circumcised . 
  * houses made of wood . 
  there you go , 
  those are actually quite sophisticated questions . 
  as for the last dutch question . 
  we do n't have two capitals , amsterdam is our capital . 
  it 's just not the seat of government . 
  you mean the industry in which gay men judge women on their looks :d, 
  ah , it turns out there 's this book that 's called `` why the french are so french '' . 
  basically because we want to bring all our stuff ( not just one suitcase ) , and enjoy the freedom to explore at our destination . 
  next year em will be wm :'(, 
  haha , it was actually why have italians come to the netherlands ( so in the past ) . 
  what the netherlands searches about europe .
