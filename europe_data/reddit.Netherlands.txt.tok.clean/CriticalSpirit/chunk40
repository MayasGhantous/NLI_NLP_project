  those differences is what makes traveling the continent so much fun . 
  of course i do n't know for sure , but when i 'm actively looking for actual dutch people , i can check my suppositions . 
  yes most of the time . 
  i can also immediately recognise americans because they have a specific way of wearing their jeans . 
  my analysis : the christian democrats are against gay marriage because a small part of their conservative christian supporters are against it . 
  the majority of their voters would probably support it but they are just less vocal/don ' t really care that much , so the minority point of view is the dominant one . 
  because the most western part of kazakhstan is geographically in europe . 
  definitely iceland . 
  the landscape was so diverse and outlandish . 
  at one time you thought you had landed on a [ foreign planet ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@64.0432122,-21.4623321,3a,75y,322.14h,90.74t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swr5pssg_ypufyosg3hqdbw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!5m1!1e4 ) , whereas one hour later you were in [ southern france ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@64.2543181,-21.0269438,3a,75y,156.72h,82.32t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1skor6weuuqsdaansancfyaa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  very cool !, 
  i do n't mind paying a small amount for using german roads ( even though germans do n't pay for ours ) , but i 'm not buying yet another windscreen sticker . 
  it 's the 21st century , be creative . 
  is n't the biggest mountain in europe disputed ? 
   believe they get something like $ 35 mill every year which is ridiculous . 
  is n't that like your gdp per capita ? 
  the most important elections are the parliamentary elections . 
  voter turnout lies between 75-80 % which is okay i guess . 
  must have been the last time in british history you looked up to continentals :p, 
   i flipped out on the british museum when i crossed paths with a visit group explaining the egypt rooms from an old testament point of view . 
  very representative story . 
  just kidding , you 'll do fine together . 
  just do n't make it too big of a mess . 
  not scotland ? 
  o wait , it 's not post-brexit yet . 
  * gone with the wind *, 
  france + netherlands vs. germany ( + belgium ) . 
  history is not on our side . 
  the story of every european country . 
  i feel sorry for the fact you live so far up north . 
  i ca n't imagine what it must feel like to drive 600km south and still be in your own cold ( yet beautiful ) country or drive all day only to reach northern germany . 
  it 's what we call a tourist trap . 
  let 's make it happen !, 
  mona lisa must be the weirdest word to have appeared on one of my french vocabulary tests . 
  i ca n't wrap my head around the fact they so often dress him up . 
  for me that would be like the city of paris wrapping a green blanket around the eiffel tower and calling it the largest christmas tree in town . 
  i mean , you want to actually see the statue now do n't you ? 
  like [ what the f * ck ] ( http://www.binche.be/detentes-loisirs/photos/carnaval-de-binche/10eme-anniversaire-unesco/le-manneken-pis-en-gille-de-binche/01.jpg/image_large ) , i came to see the statue ... 
  just visit the holy heart and you 'll have a nice view for free . 
  but you do understand that cooking or gardening actually requires some skill to be done properly . 
  manual transmission is very ` popular ' among regular consumers because it 's cheaper and the norm , but i would say automatic transmission is getting increasingly popular among business drivers , there it 's about 50-50 . 
  same in the netherlands , except for the fact that teachers will never use the formal form when talking to pupils . 
  also in tesco expresses ? 
  the system works fine , they should just shut off the weighing mechanism because that does n't work . 
  yeah , those wireless portable scanners have become a thing in the netherlands as well . 
  we 've had self scanning for quite some time now , but mostly in the form of a check out desk where you yourself do the scanning , but without the annoying : `` please place the item in the bagging area '' they have in the uk . 
  you 're not a baby , you can do that yourself , one can pack their own bags . 
  it 's seen as patronising i guess . 
  it 's not surprising that one of the most popular european firms is one that sells diy furniture . 
  people born in and around jakarta ( or batavia as it was called ) and other parts of the dutch indies will definitely remember as will their children . 
  so will the indonesians that moved to the netherlands and became/remained dutch citizens . 
   the rest is all about events in europe , since that was what affected us , our countries , and our grandparents . 
  although the focus is mainly on europe , we in the netherlands do learn about the [ japanese attacks on the dutch indies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_occupation_of_the_dutch_east_indies ) , and the fact that white europeans ( `` our grandparents '' ) were put in concentration camps by the japanese . 
  the japanese occupation is quite directly related to us losing indonesia as a colony so it 's seen as a pretty important part of our history . 
  great freedom fighter , also one of the most intelligent beings to ever walk the surface of the earth . 
  why did n't he get the nobel peace prize ? 
  jeez ... thanks obama . 
  to me you are . 
  for us , it 's like asking have you ever tried milk . 
  the fact they speak the same language as me , although those germans do have a heavy accent ... 
  yeah , that 's what i tried to imply with `` hard barriers '' , but it 's obviously a very unrealistic scenario . 
  was it because of your strict euthanasia laws ? 
  did you shoot your mother when you were a toddler ? 
  i do n't think * that * many people hate the netherlands , just them damn 'd belgians ... * i can hear your gossiping with france !, 
  in 2015 the uk exported $ 184 billion to other eu members whereas it imported $ 302 billion worth of goods and services from other eu members . 
  hard trade barriers would harm both sides , although the uk would obviously be hit harder since it loses 44 % of its exports , whereas the eu loses `` only '' 10 % of its export market . 
  exports are however less important for the uk economy than for the eu economy . 
  it would be a dramatic outcome nonetheless . 
  in the city of rotterdam it 's illegal for your dog to continuously bark or whine . 
  how would one defect to an ally ? 
  if you like forests , you would definitely like the [ utrechtse heuvelrug ] ( https://carlnoya.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/0566_carl_noya_usa_20121011_1200pix.jpg ) , [ pic2 ] ( http://bbdewillemshoeve.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/achtergrondbeeld.jpg ) . 
  that 's quite average though , is n't it ? 
  yeah , i think we have some charming towns , but i 'm not sure whether you 'll find many in ' t gooi . 
  i could give you some examples of charming towns around the netherlands : [ gouda ] ( http://r-s-b.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gouda-stadhuis-panorama.jpg ) , [ alkmaar ] ( https://s.iha.com/00142231306/alkmaar-de-lichten-van-alkmaar.jpeg ) , [ zutphen ] ( http://www.zutphen24.nl/slir/?b=ffffff&amp;w=900&amp;i=/files_lokaal24/zutphen24/2015/2015-11/langehofstraat.jpg ) , [ zierikzee ] ( https://erfgoedstem.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/zierikzee_1.jpg ) , [ hulst ] ( https://cdn.quizme.se/quiz/ee65a86c-9b00-4c76-a63a-dceff4565d7f.jpg ) and [ valkenburg ] ( http://www.campingterweierhof.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/valkenburg-.jpg ) are quite nice . 
  edit : added some towns . 
  the first picture is taken on [ sint eustatius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sint_eustatius ) , with a view from zeelandia bay on [ the quill ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/quill_volcano_on_sint_eustatius.jpg ) !, 
  here are some other pictures : [ pic ] ( https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55c750e5e4b043398e48526a/t/55c755ace4b056ace209c09d/1439127000864/dutch-antilles-st-eustatius.jpg?format=2500w ) , [ pic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/quill_dormant_vulcano.jpg ) . 
  het gooi is n't known for its stunning nature , so i 'm not entirely sure what you mean ? 
  the national parks in the dutch caribbean , by far . 
  examples : [ pic ] ( http://www.businessdestinations.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/statia.jpg ) , [ pic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/bonaire-goto-meer-1.jpg ) , [ pic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/view_from_mt_scenery,_saba.jpg ) . 
  within the continent , i really like the dunes near the coast . 
  why even bring this up , they wo n't understand ... 
  you guys must seriously see antwerp , ghent and bruges . 
  those are pretty much the highlights , i could further recommend [ the hague ] ( http://www.merkdenhaag.nl/sites/default/files/styles/homepage_grid_image/public/skyline%20den%20haag%20-%20foto%20arjan%20de%20jager,%20den%20haag%20marketing_0.jpg?itok=8xksw8xj ) ( including [ scheveningen beach ] ( http://images0.tcdn.nl/binnenland/article24286608.ece/binary/original/pier+scheveningen+nieuw.jpg ) ) , [ rotterdam ] ( https://www.ms-fotografie.nl/wp-content/gallery/5848/5848-item5.jpg ) and [ delft ] ( http://www.westcordhotels.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/uitzicht-centrum-hotels-delft.jpg ) . 
  especially rotterdam is something completely different . 
  another pearl is [ maastricht ] ( https://www.dormio.nl/media/16674/vrijthof1.jpg ) , which is a pretty atypical dutch town in the catholic south . 
  ** ex ** port, 
  it 's more like a parent whose rebellious teenage kid ran off to become a drug addict . 
  well some people will say , european nations ca n't seem to agree on anything so it 's not working . 
  in that sense they are correct if they refer to it as the eu , because this cooperation takes place within the eu . 
  it would obviously be bad to blame the commission or parliament if the council of ministers ca n't find common ground though . 
  because cyprus in its entirety lies geographically in asia . 
  why is france your least favourite ? 
  just curious . 
  nice to hear !, 
  what places in the netherlands did you visit ? 
  hot people ... * cough * i mean culture , cuisine that sort of stuff . 
  the council of ministers is an organ of the european union , so if that organ is not functioning well , it 's perfectly fine to say the eu is n't working properly . 
  this could literally be anyone 's story in the entire world outside of china , except for taiwan . 
  we are definitely more closely tied to indonesia .
