  i think it 's important to know whether you mean books in english , german or both . 
  i do n't think many would be put off buying a book written in english in an english bookstore , but they might think differently about buying a german book there . 
  haha , the idea of someone not stealing a $ 200 shopping cart because they need to put in 50 cents is rather amusing . 
  andorra , belgium , czech republic , denmark , france , germany , iceland , italy , luxembourg , monaco , the netherlands , spain , switzerland , the united kingdom and vatican city . 
  * my favourite country : la france . 
  * my least favourite country : impossible to say , none really . 
  * pleasantly surprised by : antwerp , bordeaux and prague . 
  * slightly disappointed by : barcelona and d\u00fcsseldorf . 
  perhaps he only visited an airport . 
  interesting , montenegro apparently comes from [ venetian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venetian_language ) . 
  well , you 're the result of a historical mistake ... 
  perhaps the way they look at citizenship is quite similar . 
  nhs is not very capitalist , even we have a more capitalist based health care system . 
  montenegro , does that name mean black mountain ? 
  our country is so small that moving to the other side of the country is not considered to be that big of a deal . 
  it would be like moving within your region in most other countries . 
  there are quite some cultural differences though : e.g. 
  catholic versus protestant , and different accents and dialects ( or even [ languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_frisian_language ) ) . 
  most people will tend to move to the [ randstad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/randstad ) which includes [ amsterdam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amsterdam ) , [ rotterdam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotterdam ) , [ the hague ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_hague ) and [ utrecht ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/utrecht ) ( the four largest cities ) and the urban areas in between . 
  other such hot spots are perhaps [ eindhoven ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eindhoven ) and [ maastricht ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maastricht ) in the south , [ arnhem-nijmegen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arnhem-nijmegen_metropolitan_area ) in the east and [ groningen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groningen ) up north . 
  the [ mckroket ] ( http://www.lynne-enroute.com/numlock/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mcdonalds-mckroket-in-netherlands-5992.jpg ) is only sold in the netherlands , belgium and ( the dutch island of ) cura\u00e7ao . 
  it 's a croquette stuffed with meat ragout and topped with mustard sauce . 
  another example is the [ mcflurry stroopwafel ] ( http://www.mcdonalds.nl/sites/default/files/produits/800x596.png ) and this [ special sauce ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uq5zvwwbrme/ufngodupzhi/aaaaaaaaei0/gtfw1kivdhm/s1600/20120908_152906.jpg ) called fritessaus which apparently is only available in the netherlands and belgium . 
  it 's all so ugly , i ca n't think of anything nice to be honest . 
  according to figures from statistics netherlands about 22.1 % ( 3.752.291 ) of the population ( 16.979.120 ) has a migration background , 55.9 % ( 2.096.592 ) of that being a non-western background . 
  a migration background implies that either they or ( one of ) their parents were born abroad . 
  the largest non-western groups are : * turks ( 397.471 ) * moroccans ( 385.761 ) * surinamese ( 349.022 ) * dutch caribbeans ( 150.981 ) the largest western groups are : * indonesians ( 366.849 ) * * germans ( 360.116 ) * poles ( 149.831 ) * belgians ( 116.389 ) * brits ( 84.466 ) * why is indonesia considered to be western ? 
  because these are mostly ( children of ) white people that were born in the [ dutch east indies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_east_indies ) that came back after the independence of indonesia in 1949 . 
  another large part consists of [ moluccans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moluccans ) ( ca . 
  50.000 ) that fought against the independence of indonesia alongside the dutch . 
  hahaha , spot on . 
  i find it very difficult to take someone with a [ limburgish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ticbwfg8kiu ) accent seriously . 
  well it would be kind of silly to base the official language of * europe * on its prevalence outside of europe . 
  yeah , southern europe has a far bigger problem with beggars and scams . 
   and the remaining half ~ ~ do n't care in the slightest ~ ~ does n't think they 're in europe . 
  ftfy, 
  we have recently seen a rise in eastern european beggars ( roma ? ), 
  on dutch trains . 
  they lay down a pack of tissue paper with a letter attached to it saying how they 're poor and need to feed their ( disabled ) children . 
  some even claim to be syrian refugees ( yeah right ! ) . 
  they first distribute those packages and then come back to recollect them in the hope people will give them money . 
  i encounter this probably once every week on my daily commute . 
  apart from that , it 's not very common where i live . 
  and why would i care about the opinion of one mep ? 
  does danuta h\u00fcbner solely determine eu policy ? 
  the eu does n't want to ditch english and apart from that , the eu does n't have one single official language that all its citizens speak . 
   if eu makes spanish the official language of the eu , it would also make the eu as a competitor of the anglosaxon world . 
  like that 's ever gon na happen . 
  how are we all supposed to learn spanish all of a sudden ? 
  i randomly stumbled upon this rather awkward [ belgian eurovision entry ] ( https://youtu.be/iqulkchgn6i?t=1m30s ) of 1983 . 
  ireland has even lower tax rates right ? 
   consociationalism now that 's a tough word to pronounce if you think it 's something to do with socialism . 
  liberal , i would say the netherlands , belgium and perhaps spain . 
  left wing , at the moment greece , but i do n't know enough about most other countries ' political colours . 
  i see what you did there , trying to claim those swiss and austrians as your own ... 
  a strong external european border should be a european value though . 
  there could literally be millions of reasons and no one here will provide you with the correct one , because nobody was there and nobody knows you or the officer . 
  you 're focusing on race , but perhaps he thought you were pushy or rude , there 's really no use in speculating . 
  he sounds fairly reasonable , the only ( insurmountable ) issues i have with trump are his stance on climate change and his environmental policies . 
  if you want to gamble with your country 's future or the world economy , that 's one thing , but you better not gamble with the future of our planet . 
  combine them and you get the mother of all factors : two devastating wars . 
  wanted to mention this , the international perfume museum is also very authentic . 
  [ pretty damn hilly . 
  ] ( http://cdn.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/72-hours-saba-gear-patrol-lead-full.jpg ), 
  perhaps because iceland is not in the eu and does n't have mass immigration , pretty much the main topics for the far right . 
  especially when they throw in french words : * alors * , let me * h * elp you . 
  this is [ brabantian dutch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wno6ydn8u0 ) as spoken in the southern province of north-brabant ( i know that sounds confusing , but that 's because south-brabant is in belgium ^ or ^ * was * ^ to ^ make ^ it ^ even ^ more ^ confusing . ), 
  there 's less emphasis on the guttural g sound , and with more of a rolling r-sound . 
  edit : he 's not actually singing in brabantian dialect , it 's just the accent . 
  italian , no doubt . 
  nee , ik ben morgan freeman . 
  are you working tomorrow ? 
  no , i am off tomorrow . 
  * [ ik zag twee beren broodjes smeren ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z50loak266q ) - * i saw two bears butter bread * * [ tante uit marokko en die komt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwnm5sk-nju ) - * i have an aunt from morocco and she 's coming over * * [ hoedje van papier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fa-cfj8tae ) - * little paper hat * and we also have a large variety of sinterklaas songs , but it will look very racist outside of the netherlands and belgium : * [ zie ginds komt de stoomboot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqtlzqqwhge ) - * see yonder , the steamboat is coming * * [ sinterklaasje kom maar binnen met je knecht ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo9vlhaclmw ) - * sinterklaas , come on in with your servant * o gosh , how can i even explain this ... * this is a [ compilation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg5xr8uq5l8 ) of sinterklaas songs . 
  edit : please let them listen to [ schnappi , das kleine krokodil ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aguwpyiehtk ) , in 2004 this song reached number 1 in the dutch charts and lots of other european charts . 
  it was such a fun hype . 
  i got the pronunciation right though , although i ca n't prove it . 
  what ? 
  sophisticated sweden does n't have a standardised ticket system for public transport ? 
  i really like the melody and message of la marseillaise . 
  presidents or also prime ministers ? 
  to me it sounds like some northern/eastern dutch dialect that i ca n't figure out , but even more distinct . 
  they do n't have ben and jerry 's in deutschland ? 
  [ great !, 
  ] ( https://media.tenor.co/images/d95fb857db40fc584de3981fca3398c9/raw ), 
  why not turn brussels into an eu dependency , we 'll call it district of jupan . 
  [ this immediately comes to mind ... ] ( https://youtu.be/w0jin0wee8c?t=7m20s ), 
  is belgium a * real * country or will you guys break up in the course of this century ? 
  not just carrefour , also e.leclerc and auchan !, 
  i know , but being in france adds nostalgia to it for me . 
  i am a big fan of french hypermarkets or hypermarch\u00e9s . 
  you can find them everywhere in france and it 's so much fun to walk around these big stores while grocery shopping . 
  we already have a european broadcasting union and eurovision seems to be fairly popular . 
  there might be room for more pan-european shows in other categories . 
  not entirely coincidentally ... 
  the name `` hollande '' originally meant `` one originally from holland . '', 
  we 're so sorry !, 
  exactly . 
  there is no dutch word for * sibling * . 
  gni coefficient , the point is that income is not equally distributed .
