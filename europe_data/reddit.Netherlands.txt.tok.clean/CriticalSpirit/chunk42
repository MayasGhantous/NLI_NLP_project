  not saying that this necessarily makes us better , just saying that 's why people think we are . 
  because ` average ' is not a good indicator , you should use median income . 
  yes , i believe laws should be clear for the sake of legal certainty . 
  i do n't consider either of them european . 
   europe , where the usa is literally somalia . 
  those are your words , not mine . 
  the way i look at somalia : poverty , war and corruption . 
  part of that applies to some parts of the us , but the us is so much more , and far more likeable . 
  oh well , creative thinking . 
   i do feel a bit vindicated after ( europe 's ) 9/11 this week europe 's 9/11 ? 
  no , no , no . 
  it does seem weird to me , and i do n't really understand why you 'd want only a few states to truly have any influence . 
  it also causes you to only get two parties that have a chance at winning , there 's no room for outsiders or independents . 
   since they tend to be more progressive than us . 
  * cough * , they 're not . 
  i 'm not worried one bit about russia . 
  i 'm more worried that our dikes will burst and our country will no longer be able to fight the sea because trump denies the human factor in climate change . 
  but that would have happened regardless of who had won in the us . 
  we can hopefully restore our relationship with russia , and cooperate with both the us and russia in syria and iraq . 
  i do n't support it because it 's impossible to identify hate speech without being subjective , i draw the line at inciting violence . 
  i think the effect will be rather small . 
  the french and germans do n't really look up to america when it comes to politics . 
  there are populist forces in europe , but they 're mostly about social welfare , islamic migration and the democratic deficit within the european union , and less about inter-european trade , gun laws , military efforts or social policies . 
  most europeans think donald trump is a clown , even right wing politicians . 
  what ? 
  she was bought by trump , she has no substance , other than her looks . 
  yes and the us and uk are part of the nato treaty . 
  oh please , plenty of western countries have the capability to create nuclear arms if necessary . 
  if she continues her strategy of copying michelle obama there 's some hope . 
  the us are magnificent , and despite political issues one of the best countries in this world , one president wo n't change that . 
  bare in mind as well that clinton won the popular vote . 
  there 's got to be more to it , i doubt that 's how it works . 
  which makes sense , but people generally speak in terms of western and eastern europe , at least over here . 
  i guess it is difficult if you speak english , but there 's certainly a lot of british accents that people on the continent will have a hard time understanding . 
  so perhaps if you thicken your accent it will have the same effect . 
  i can think of one time i pretended to not understand someone that was trying to sell something to me in the uk . 
  it was very effective . 
  i would , and probably those that only make the distinction between western and eastern europe . 
  you 're not trying to argue czechia ( yes i am using this word , deal with it ) should be considered western europe right ? 
  no , i do n't think that should be legal , i rather have the planet kill us all , then us starting to kill selected groups of people , or total warfare . 
  in dutch we have * ogenschijnlijk * which pretty much means ` seemingly ' or ` apparently ' , but can be literally translated as ` eyes-apparent ' . 
  that also tends to happen in other parts of the world . 
  nepal had two big quakes within a month of each other last year . 
  `` robert downey jr. to play iran man in new movie about the iranian revolution . '', 
  afaik there 's small earthquakes all the time in seismically active areas . 
  you 'll find the same in other areas all over the world . 
  nope , the only custom is to write the first letter with a capital letter . 
  could be both , but i doubt he 's never used his debit card in germany . 
  would you name your first child firstborn ? 
  well there 's no such perception here , perhaps among a small minority , but not the majority . 
  you are confusing wwii and wwi . 
  still better than mittwoch ... 
  amen . 
  the swiss and belgian french are more or less doing it the right way though . 
  in dutch you literally just say ` one january ' or ` thirty march ' . 
  that 31 thing is the same in dutch : logic not found . 
  andorra directly borders catalunya , so apparently it does resemble its neighbours . 
  i do n't really care , my country could be considered a micro-state as well , if not for the population size . 
  as long as those small countries do n't exploit us by becoming tax havens , there 's no need for them to give way . 
  they can however never become full eu member states , at least not with veto power in my opinion . 
  seldom , and among white-collar workers , hardly ever . 
  interesting wikipedia fact : the belgians were upset about the fact that the german emperor found refuge in the netherlands after the war , so belgium wanted to lay its hand on southern parts of our country . 
  the netherlands prepared for an invasion of belgium . 
  the allied forces denounced the belgian claims because they did n't want another war on the continent . 
  this language was not made for singing , it 's actually very difficult to sing in dutch , let alone to make it sound good . 
  i found that recently dutch rap has been making a return , with hits from [ lil kleine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swivbesd50 ) , [ ronnie flex ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vz_sbbeurs ) , [ broederliefde ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjosne0giko ) and [ de jeugd van tegenwoordig ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri1f5e8kmfe ) . 
  the era of [ ali b ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83mjmw3yh3a ) , [ brace ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tysgq5qbf7e ) , [ yes-r ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akflkqelzeo ) and [ lange frans & baas b ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaymuzxlttc ) is definitely over . 
  i do n't know any church songs , but i guess this qualifies ? 
  * [ genesis - jesus he knows me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35k6vqrt67g ) * [ monty python - always look on the bright side of life ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlbilnn1nhq ), 
   for the time being , climate change is being good to us . 
  with all the rain fall and floods ? 
  yeah basically because of the deal between the eu and turkey , but african migrants keep coming because italy and other coast guards keep picking them up on demand and it 's hard to make a deal with libya . 
  speaking in terms of tides is perfectly reasonable , your response is somewhat over the top . 
  we watched fragments of the film adoptation of im westen nichts neues in history class , but also of the bbc series * [ blackadder goes forth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejc1wwrgjfk ) * . 
  to boys ardent for some desperate glory , the old lie : dolce et decorum est pro patria mori . 
  something like that , 
  there will not be a no-fly zone if russia does not allow it , hillary wants to pretty much negotiate it , and will fail . 
  the government website says 18 . 
  everyone over 18 can legally work in prostitution . 
  if you want to exploit a ` workplace ' for prostitutes , you need to apply for a permit at your municipality . 
  it has been legal since 1811 . 
  both . 
  this is insulting and honestly has no place on this sub in my opinion . 
  even parts of the netherlands , 
  do n't skip prague if you 've never been there and perhaps go to monaco instead of cannes . 
  among the most famous and popular are : * [ epke zonderland ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/epke_zonderland ) ( olympic golden medalist 2012 - horizontal bar , gymnastics ) - aka * the flying dutchman * * [ sven kramer ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sven_kramer ) ( triple olympic golden medalist 2010 , 2014 - speed skating ) * [ dafne schippers ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/dafne_schippers ) ( european champion 100m and world champion 200m sprint , olympic silver medalist 2016 ), 
  theory test , 25 questions about recognising danger , 40 questions about traffic rules and insights . 
  you need at least 13/25 and 35/40 to pass . 
  then you have a practical test , some 40 minutes , in which you also have to do some ` special manoeuvres ' , like parking , u-turn and such . 
  you can get your license at 17 , but then you 'll have to drive with an experienced supervisor until you 're 18 . 
  if you 've driven a manual , you can drive both automatics and manuals , if you 've driven an automatic , you are only allowed to drive automatics . 
  well , our 50plus party ( for the elderly ) had this [ protest song ] ( https://youtu.be/fbnejxnvjfi ) which in the chorus simply says something like `` get your hands off of my money ! '', 
  ... be aware , it 's an embarrasing and populist song ... 
  hot topics are generally immigration/racism and health care , but rather whether it should be made even less expensive , not whether everyone should have access to it , that 's not up for debate . 
  another hot topic is the gas production in the groningen province as it causes small earthquakes . 
  sinterklaas season in the netherlands and belgium . 
  well , yes , if you read my first comment , i did n't name belarus as one of the exceptions . 
  belarusians gain nothing by me not visiting their country . 
  every other year during the night/morning , we have a strong winter every five years or so . 
  last one was in 2013 when temperatures went as low as -23 degrees .
