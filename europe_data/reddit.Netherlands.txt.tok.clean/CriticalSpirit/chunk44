  i did n't know norway was such a young country . 
  but , but ... that 's the [ flag of zeeland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/flag_of_zeeland.svg ) !, 
  please come up with something original , what about [ this ] ( https://www.icij.org/sites/icij/files/1200px-brands.jpg ) ? 
  well it 's certainly not gibberish , but for me it sounds like a scandinavian speaking german . 
  indeed , i can easily understand german spoken on the other side of the border , but i can barely follow swiss german for example . 
  when anti-semitic laws were adopted , when party troops started marching the streets , i do n't know . 
  all i know is that is has 0 to do with modern day uk . 
  a little eu before the eu even existed , a customs union agreed upon by the war governments in exile in 1944 . 
  there is eu legislation on mutual diploma recognition , i 'm not entirely sure how it works . 
  haha , i 'm glad i 've moved past roman law ... 
  pretty much the same here . 
  i wonder , does polish civil law differ much from dutch law . 
  i know this is impossible to answer , but for example , what kind of topics are you covering ? 
  what is eu studies ? 
  is it european law , politics , economics ? 
  to literally translate what you wrote : ` may i i feathers dutchman in egg * preven liv * . ', 
  but yeah , dutch is pretty similar to english and almost identical to german so if you know the basics of those two languages , i guess it 's understandable . 
  i recently found out that welsh has the same guttural ` ch ' sound as dutch !, 
  the welsh and dutch should unite and take over england . 
  i wonder what 's worse , people disliking the sound of your speech , or people not even noticing when you speak . 
  danish sounds so funny , it 's as if you 're talking dutch but with your mouth stuffed full . 
  are * you * really polish ? 
  definitely take the intercity direct from schiphol airport to amsterdam central station , you can buy a train ticket in the arrival lounge ( there 's multiple vending machines ) , and get to the trains underground , just follow the signs . 
  english in the netherlands and abroad , basic french/german in france and germany . 
  does it matter ? 
  it 's in my flair , the netherlands . 
  amazing , everything you dream it to be , but also extremely crowded and hectic . 
  i will definitely come back , but not as a resident . 
  this may sound very patriotic , but i really think i live in one of the best countries in the world . 
  no , there 's more people with buddha statues than illustrations of jesus i think . 
  to a certain degree . 
  that 's not why it 's funny . 
  normally i would say there 's little correlation between quality and reaching the finale , but san marino is an exception . 
  * america * dieren ( * animals * ) * grauwe kat ( * dull cat * ) * nummer een ( * number one * ) * hellevoetsluis ( * hell foot sluice * ) * holysloot ( * holy ditch * ) * armhoede ( * poverty * ) * vrouwentroost ( * women 's comfort * ) * de cocksdorp ( de cocks - * village * ) * duistere steeg ( * dark alley * ) * lekkerkerk ( * delicious church * ) * moddergat ( * quagmire * or rather * mud hole * ) * nude * tiengeboden ( * ten commandments * ) * pijnacker ( * pain acre * ) * sexbierum ( * sex beer-um * ) * drogeham ( * dry ham * ), 
  it seems that in the video clip version she goes all out , i like that one better .

  that 's why their eurovision entries are mostly foreign ( italian ) artists . 
   when the spouse of a high ranking government official gets a very nice job for no reason . 
  names ? 
  [ zwartboek ] ( http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt0389557/ ) ( 2006 )  in the nazi-occupied netherlands during world war ii , a jewish singer infiltrates the regional gestapo headquarters for the dutch resistance . 
  bafta award nominee . 
  that 0.01 % being breivik . 
  i do n't think that 's fair . 
  cameron and may are not responsible for the democratic and sovereign decision of the british people , they merely facilitated it , and facilitating democracy is not a bad or hateful thing . 
  they even actively promoted their side of the argument . 
  they have always been * tsjechi\u00eb * in dutch . 
  * sets up pancake shields * * installs milk cannon *, 
  come and get it . 
  gives us a reason to start the annexation . 
  it 's going to be dutch , of course ... 
  brabant wallon and brabant flamand will merge into one province under the name of zuid-brabant . 
  this new province will not merge with noord-brabant , because antwerpen is in between . 
  that 's already part of our plan to annex flanders . 
  just reconquer * brabant wallon * and restore the old province of zuid-brabant with capital brussel . 
  there is no logical reason for east-limburg to be in the netherlands , but west-limburg to be in belgium . 
  it 's completely artificial . 
   overmorrow - the day after tomorrow or \u00fcbermorgen ereyesterday - the day before yesterday still actively used in the netherlands as * eergisteren * . 
  i know right , who 'd ever come up with that ... 
  typical america bashing and arrogance gets up voted here , does n't surprise me . 
  why do n't you just stay where you are if travelling is such a burden ... 
  you 're so used to it that you do n't even notice . 
  just do n't get into an accident in countries like serbia . 
  it 's like africa when it comes to administration/paper work . 
   so many broken tires just laying along the regular highway though . 
  just like belgium . 
  i guess many people like to put the blame on the us ( which is not entirely untruthful ) , but they fail to see that we had our own responsibilities , our own decision-making process . 
  let us also not forget about anders rasmussen ( foreign minister of denmark at the time ) , who was one of the biggest proponents for military intervention it seemed . 
  what a surprise he was promoted to secretary general of nato in 2009 ... 
  my impression was that they were actually pretty good . 
  i was however disappointed by the public transport system , especially in nyc , compared to major european subway systems . 
  sure the us has a lot of homeless people and religious street preachers , but cities like paris and rome are worse when it comes to beggars , crazy people and lots of migrants ( and it has gotten worse over the years ) . 
  the constant blaring sirens in nyc and dc were striking though . 
  because we trusted the americans when they said they had solid proof of wmds . 
  it was only a few years after 9/11 , we stood firm by our ally , as we had in afghanistan . 
  do n't get me wrong , we should have awaited the results of the un research team , we fucked up too .

  so most europeans do n't . 
  there is no such thing as the right to have an abortion . 
  it just does n't exist . 
  we might have strong opinions on this matter , but there is no legal document that says eu countries must have liberal abortion laws . 
  that 's got to be it . 
  does n't me i do n't appreciate the historic architecture in the city centre of course . 
  you really should . 
  never in my life had i seen such blue/green water . 
  i knew it . 
  by the way , why not include les gorges du verdon ? 
  they 're the biggest in europe are n't they ? 
  j'aime la belle france ... , that castle ( third bullet ) is near tours right ? 
  i think i remember it . 
  many see it as a better alternative for driving . 
  i think it 's pretty bold and simplistic to say you have a very negative view of european scientists , just because certain data is behind a paywall . 
  it 's not as if that makes european scientists better or worse at doing their job , and it 's probably not even something they have any influence on . 
  apparently your government has decided it should be made publicly available , that 's a political choice with which most would probably agree . 
  but your government has also decided to not or barely fund american students attending college . 
  should we now have a negative view of the american scientific community , of course not . 
  drunk driving happens but i would n't say it 's an excessive problem here . 
  drunk bicycle riding is a completely different story though ... 
  i 'll start . 
  i always enjoy walking the [ willemsbrug in rotterdam ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@51.9172719,4.4953961,3a,75y,248.63h,85.89t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s-8dw8bgkvcse%2fu52hjtulhni%2faaaaaaaaaaa%2f5kcvboehr_m!2e4!3e11!7i10000!8i5000 ) , my home town .
