  especially at sun set , it provides a truly magnificent scenery . 
  my favourite spot in europe has to be [ the view from la grande arche ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/espace+grande+arche/@48.892433,2.2364775,3a,55.3y,112.16h,89.72t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-bnl5rswsqwc%2fvbcmxhfxkli%2faaaaaaaalj4%2f1ho_pl6rfi4z-e4__pexhjf2paifw3g3wclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-bnl5rswsqwc%2fvbcmxhfxkli%2faaaaaaaalj4%2f1ho_pl6rfi4z-e4__pexhjf2paifw3g3wclib%2fw240-h100-n-k-no%2f!7i10752!8i4474!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xda00f32e580d24a5!8m2!3d48.8923858!4d2.2366378 ) in la d\u00e9fense near paris . 
  you can see as far as the arc de triomphe . 
  whenever i 'm in paris , it 's my number one stop . 
  * peanut butter very common and widely available . 
  most popular brand [ calv\u00e9 pindakaas ] ( https://www.calve.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/calve_pindakaas-663x747.png ) . 
  * jam/jelly/preserves jam is also pretty common . 
  i think most people just buy the brand of their local supermarket , but a popular general brand would be [ hero ] ( https://www.ah.nl.kpnis.nl/static/product/ahi_434d50323239323734_1_lowres_jpg.jpg ) . 
  jelly and preserves are n't as popular as jam . 
  * ready to eat meals . 
  these are available all over europe , in the netherlands they 're called ` kant-en-klaar maaltijden ' . 
  * common breakfast items common breakfast items include peanut butter , [ hagelslag ] ( http://static-cdn.holland-at-home.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/900x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/8/7/8710496977176_1.jpg ) / [ vlokken ] ( http://www.theboxofholland.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1200x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/i/m/img_2591_de_ruijter_extra_puur_royale_vlokken_front.png ) , [ chocolate spread ] ( https://www.retaildetail.nl/sites/default/files/news/dphazelnut_eu_200g_151023rgb.jpg ) and ham/cheese . 
  * common beverages soda , juices , milk . 
  * common condiments [ heinz ketchup ] ( http://www.heinz.com/media/downloads/view/newly_redesigned_heinzketchup_bottles.png ) , [ calv\u00e9 mayonaise ] ( https://www.ah.nl.kpnis.nl/static/product/ahi_434d50303232303034_3_lowres_jpg.jpg ) , [ k\u00fchne mosterd ] ( http://cmgtcontent.ahold.com.kpnis.nl/cmgtcontent/media//001300000/000/001300074_001_203325_708.jpg ) are popular , but there 's also plenty of local supermarket brands . 
  * when it comes to pasta do you buy dry pasta/canned sauce or make from scratch ? 
  i buy dry pasta and bottled sauce from [ grand ` italia ] ( http://www.granfood.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_grand_italia_04_cf9ada49d8.jpg ) , but again , there 's plenty of other small brands . 
  * common alcoholic beverages ? 
  [ hertog jan ] ( http://www.thevalley.nl/cms_data/contents/thevalley/media/cases/hertogjan/chapter1-visual.png ) , [ heineken ] ( http://www.heineken.com/~/resources/images/assets/2-navigation-tile-484x967-jpg.jpg?process=crop&amp;h=610&amp;w=260&amp;la=en ) , [ ( amstel ) radler ] ( http://kroondoppen.wimspijker.nl/extra/afbeelding/a/amstl-radler_citroen-2016.png ) , [ grolsch ] ( http://www.leadingtalent.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/grolsch_2012-range_rgb.jpg ) and [ jillz ] ( http://missglutenvrij.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/114sb004-banner-590-x-325-jillz.jpg ) are popular beer/cider brands . 
  we drink a variety of wines from france and southern europe . 
  and popular brands for strong drinks are [ smirnoff ] ( http://liquor.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/smirnoff-vodka.jpg ) , [ jack daniel 's ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cpbdv83weaatykm.png ) , [ bacardi ] ( http://www.chatchow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bacardi-1.jpg ) and lots of others . 
  the us have more liberal abortion laws than most of europe , they have gay marriage whereas most europeans do n't . 
  euthanasia is still very restricted but they 're [ not the exception , we are ] ( http://ewn.co.za/cdn/-%2fmedia%2f98a1bc1bd5a14357be474dfcf821ebf5.ashx%3fas%3d1%26h%3d697%26w%3d700 ) . 
  that would probably be [ my mayor ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/muslim-mayor-of-rotterdam-ahmed-aboutaleb-tells-extremists-who-dont-like-freedom-to-f-off-9975459.html ) . 
  if it 's well constructed and the federal government would have limited powers , i would support it . 
  my condolences . 
   no , ~ ~ we 'll ~ ~ they 'll be better independent . 
  let wallonia be . 
  not going to happen , we will annex flanders the minute it becomes available . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  i think it 's one of the most pro-european countries just because they 're so small and multilingual . 
  perhaps like the [ benelux ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benelux ) . 
  most likely luxembourg . 
  it reminds me of the twin towers from that angle , which is pretty much the only thing i like about the building . 
  fair enough . 
  does it classify as a building though ? 
  the tallest building in rotterdam is the [ maastoren ] ( http://www.rotterdamarchitectuurprijs.nl/media/images/thumb_constrain_1136_1136/maastoren01.jpg ) ( 165m ) which is also the tallest tower in the netherlands , yet not the biggest building , which is [ de rotterdam ] ( http://www.ddc.consulting/images/projecten/derotterdam2.jpg ) , also in my home city . 
  they 're currently working on a new building here called the [ zalmhaventoren ] ( http://www.rtm-xl.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zalmhaventoren-veerhaven.jpg ) which is designed to be 218m tall . 
  they 're ` singing ' about going back to the countryside , where things are presumably better for them , because there 's always beer . 
  they have a strong rural accent . 
  the website has got several spelling errors , like :  the holiday you should of had . 
   sever diarrhoea if [ this information ] ( https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10261945 ) is correct , this company has only recently been incorporated ( 5 july 2016 ) . 
  the registered office address does not correspond to the address mentioned on the website . 
  unless multiple people died i do n't see how failing a hygiene check results in such high refunds . 
  it 's too good to be true . 
  did you find information about this investigation , because people travelling with european airlines getting a # 1,500 refund would be all over the news . 
  this is very shallow thinking and to make it a fair comparison you should compare it to the randstad wanting independence from the rest of the netherlands because they have to pay more taxes compared to poor outer regions . 
  just delete this please , this is embarrassing . 
  mh17 criminal investigation results will be presented today at 12:45 cest if i remember correctly . 
  more competition among space agencies ( be they private or public ) will generally lead to better achievements and cost reduction , so i think it 's a good thing . 
  agreed , the uk is entitled to its opinion and a vote against the eu , is not a vote against europe . 
  free movement is not so much about schengen . 
  it 's about the right to settle and work in every eu country . 
  the uk has free movement , but is not a part of schengen . 
   language is n't an issue for me , i am equally horrible at learning any of them :p nicosia it is . 
  damn , you 're trying to turn us fat !, 
   for example , english-speaking people tend to speak firstly in english , without even asking if you speak it , and they take for granted that you will maket he effort to speak to them in english , but whatever , i think that annoys everyone i would do that as well , it would actually be more insulting to assume they do n't speak english , as if they look uneducated . 
  we invest in one caravan , and save years on hotel expenditures . 
  it 's just a business case . 
  letting millions of migrants enter europe with little public consent is pretty radical . 
  i do n't know , sarkozy and merkel used to be this great team that put european interest first , but now they have both radicalised it seems . 
  yeah , and i liked our entry this year . 
  our refuelling stop on the way south . 
  we are appropriating their culture , they 're the reason we 're writing in english and perhaps even the reason you wrote flavor as opposed to flavour . 
  for them this * is * an american website , and they will not always be aware of the fact that other nationalities might not understand something , because they are n't as immersed into our culture as we are into theirs . 
  if i were an american i would be very confused by all this criticism for just acting , what i perceive as , normal . 
  it can actually really hurt and creates this atmosphere of animosity , for really not that big of a reason . 
   most people from other countries feel this is a part of the international internet , and that means it 's polite to make sure your comment can be understood easily by other nationalities . 
  there 's an urge for us to be more ` international ' because we 're writing in a different language , so we are actively reminded about it all the time . 
  they are not so i ca n't really blame them . 
   from this it follows that americans ought to realize that speaking about being irish is confusing and should adapt their language . 
  it 's not all that confusing , we on our part have to understand context as well . 
  thank you so much !, 
  the west highland way looks [ stunningly beautiful and rough ] ( http://www.hikeview.co.uk/westhighland/whw4.jpg ) , and is definitely worth considering . 
   what 's annoying is when americans just straight up say `` i 'm irish '' ( or italian , norwegian , polish , or whatever ) . 
  that 's because every american will understand what you mean by that . 
  they know you 're not saying you 're an irish immigrant that was born and raised in ireland , unless you have a thick irish accent . 
  americans will tell * each other * they 're italian/irish/german whatever , but that 's not what they 'll tell foreigners . 
  i do n't know garth brooks , and ca n't tell you anything about his fan base in the netherlands . 
  there is however a fairly popular band called the common linnets ( with lead singer ilse delange ) that has actively been promoting americana/country music . 
  in 2014 they [ participated in eurovision ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwe8prsw4t0 ) which they nearly won . 
  this summer they gave a [ tv lecture ] ( http://dewerelddraaitdoor.vara.nl/media/362217 ) about americana music on prime time television . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eolpvr4zvfu ) is one of their recent hits . 
  before the common linnets ilse delange had a solo career , and some songs ca n't go unmentioned : * [ ilse delange - so incredible ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojwafi3cw5e ) * [ ilse delange - next to me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32vfwkmobdg ) * [ ilse delange - i 'm not so tough ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paa2nrba7eu ) it might not all be 100 % pure american style music , but she 's clearly influenced and a fan . 
  could you suggest some of those scottish villages , apart from inverness ( which i know is more of a city ) . 
  do you mean the villages near the coasts , or in the highlands ? 
  we are not luxembourg though are we ? 
  no , i said it would be irresponsible on our part ( europe ) to pull back , since we have such a good deal right now . 
  we are not capable of defending ourselves on our own , so right now the us is technically responsible for european security . 
  it 's a shame we do n't invest more in our defence , because i want us to be able to defend america as well , not only the other way around . 
  so , no i do n't think they * should * be responsible for european security , because that would imply i think i have a say in american politics . 
  whether americans want to be in nato is up to them , not us . 
  all i can say is that i appreciate and cherish it . 
  i know right , how silly of me / s, 
   so , do you see it likely , that in another 150 years the eu will have grown in a similar trajectory as the u.s. , or is it more likely in your mind that it 's member states will continue with roughly the same level of autonomy ? 
  i find this very hard to answer . 
  the coming decades will be crucial , we could see a further integrating europe , but as of now it 's just as likely that the eu will collapse and get replaced by something less fundamental . 
  what will be of great importance is the way we deal with immigration . 
  if the influx stays high or increases once again ( as of now it 's gone down because of the deal with turkey ) things can escalate more quickly than some might think . 
  i hope our politicians understand that the unity of europe is far more important than taking the moral high ground on immigration . 
  it has already cost us brexit .
