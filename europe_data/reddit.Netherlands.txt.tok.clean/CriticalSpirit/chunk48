  * fine as well . 
  * one beer please . 
  * can i have a beer . 
  equal , better in some policy areas , worse in others . 
  i still have that starter package , would it be worth something ( apart from the face value ) ? 
  like by a very large margin . 
  romanian empire ? 
  you mean the roman empire , haha !, 
  mostly shame when it comes to indonesia , because of the bloody war for independence , but apart from that , we treated them fairly well . 
  shame as well regarding the slave trade to suriname . 
  the independence of suriname was actually more or less our idea rather than theirs , too costly for having too little influence , a mistake i think . 
  suriname is kind of the only colony where they speak dutch , and we share so much history . 
  surinamese are well integrated in dutch society and actually half of all surinamese people live in the netherlands . 
  last but not least , i just love the fact some beautiful , sunny caribbean islands are still part of our kingdom . 
  i think the caribbean dutch profit as well , because we fight corruption and finance their budget deficits . 
  i hope we will remain one kingdom in the future . 
  edit : i forgot about south-africa/namibia !, 
  apart from the ugly history of apartheid ( most famous dutch loan word ) , it 's a very interesting colony because a few million people in south-africa and namibia still speak dutch , well some weird version ( afrikaans ) . 
  ever wondered why the capital of namibia is called windhoek , there you have it . 
  edit 2 : new netherlands and new amsterdam , coolest former colony !, 
  we 're behind the names brooklyn ( breukelen ) , harlem ( haarlem ) , rhode island ( rood eiland = red island ) , staten island ( staaten eiland ) and [ many others ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_place_names_of_dutch_origin ) . 
  it 's not that common in the netherlands afaik . 
  only if asked actually . 
  gedser-rostock would presumably be even more expensive . 
  why would that even be an option , because of berlin ? 
  far more people live around hamburg , bremen , hannover and das ruhrgebiet . 
  i 'm talking about important elections in germany , hungary , the czech republic , the netherlands and france . 
  end of 2017 , after the european election cycle . 
  czech republic, 
  i 'm not really a fan of those , but they 're quite popular in certain areas , especially fishing-villages . 
  the forefather of our current king , william-alexander of orange-nassau . 
   you ca n't choose your monarch . 
  oh , we actually did in 1581 . 
  that year we ditched king philip ii of spain and asked the french king 's brother to be our monarch . 
  we were hoping france would support us in the war against spain ( the war that started after we ditched him as our king ) . 
  the french did n't support us , so we got rid of him as well and appointed the earl of leicester , a friend of queen elizabeth i. 
  when he actually started collaborating with the spaniards we ousted him as our leader and decided we would fend for ourselves . 
  and that 's how we became the dutch republic . 
  you should try a [ bitterbal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bitterballen ) or a [ frikandel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frikandel ) . 
  what , why haha , do they at least understand you 're trying to greet them ? 
  for me turkey joining does n't make sense . 
  they 're not european culturally and only a tiny bit geographically . 
  right now , they 're not even a functioning democracy . 
  i would be highly sceptical . 
  why do n't they prefer subtitles ? 
  i mean , when i 'm with friends it always ends up with someone or a few being loud and noisy , talking during the movie , especially when it 's a horror movie and they 're not scared * at all * . 
  that 's not a problem if you have subs . 
  i 've actually had a british family come up to me with a french phrase book in monaco . 
  literally citing from her book in broken french , the mother asked me where she could find the train station . 
  apparently she thought i was a local , so she was completely caught off guard when i said i did n't speak much french but i could definitely tell her where the train station was , in english . 
  i felt horrible for bluntly mucking up her cordial attempt at speaking french with a local . 
  for some reason i feel they pronounce words more clearly , perhaps they have a better articulation . 
  it makes it easier to distinguish words that are closely related to dutch/german . 
  for some reason , of all scandinavian languages , norwegian seems to make most sense for me , swedish the least . 
  i have never seen anything dubbed for adults in the netherlands . 
  it 's not even an option . 
  since we 're exposed to german relatively often in school and on television , i am definitely able to follow a normal conversation in slowly spoken german . 
  it wo n't bother us , we will [ bother the sea ] ( http://mvmbetonstaal.nl/images/projecten/2e-maasvlakte-juni-2011-no.-3.jpg ) . 
   finland gets the peak of halti from norway if all goes well . 
  i read haiti ... 
  i 'm not buying it . 
  you 're telling me there has never ever been a place of which you thought : ` wow , i did n't expect it to be * this * nice ! ', 
  how boring . 
  raqqa would be on the bottom of my list as well . 
  edit : people ca n't take jokes . 
  as one says , this is all so deep , adele is rolling in it . 
  netherlands 2 . 
  dutch speaking region of europe ( netherlands + flanders ) 4 . 
  kingdom of the netherlands ( so including aruba , cura\u00e7ao and sint-maarten ) 5 . 
  germanic europe 6 . 
  westerner ( eu+usa+can+nz+aus+a frikaners in south africa ), 
  switzerland . 
  completely enclosed by the european union and the eurozone , but does n't give a fuck about that . 
  they 're just doing their own thing . 
  even two world wars did n't make them bat an eye , as long as they could steal europe 's gold ... 
  provence in france . 
  this is rather poor judgement . 
  greece 's economy for instance was not stable in 2004 , the bubble just had n't burst yet . 
  you forgot about iceland . 
  the last thing they should do is grant those people asylum if they reach greek shores . 
  perhaps designate one island , send everyone there , and make an agreement with countries such as lebanon and jordan to swap refugees . 
  you could try [www.rentalcars.com ] ( http://www.rentalcars.com/ ) . 
  it will indeed be expensive since you 'll have to opt for unlimited mileage , and will have an extra overnight stay in france . 
  it might after all be better ( and cheaper ) to fly from lisbon to prague or vienna , and rent a car from the airport . 
  most ( if not all ) airliners will [ charge extra ] ( http://www.flytap.com/usa/enus/planbook/preparefortravel/specialneeds/travellingwithanimals ) for bringing pets . 
  i think renting a car is your best option , as you 're not going to be able to transport a dog and cat by public transport . 
  flying with pets is not impossible , but will cause some hassle . 
  i 'm not sure about the germans , but let me explain on behalf of my country . 
  those people you see are actually government agents sent by our king to spy on the king 's subjects . 
  his majesty wants to ascertain himself his servants behave well travelling abroad . 
  those campers are used for transmitting stockpiles of data , collected by sophisticated gadgets designed to look like ordinary objects such as ` beer cans ' and ` cell phones ' . 
  it 's a great way for the king to make sure his influence extends past our national borders . 
  in the past , there have been calls by politicians to stop this practise , but in a referendum held in october last year , 102 % of the population rejected the reform . 
  we have more people on our side  . <, 
  british english in school , american english from the entertainment industry . 
  the latter tends to prevail in colloquial speech . 
  interesting fact : the netherlands and france actually share a border in the caribbean on the island of [ saint martin/sint maarten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_martin ) . 
  ah , the [ labelle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz89h0dfvtk ) generation ... 
  our french classes were basically learning french through learning about le monde francophone et ses cultures . 
  ah , the famous dom-toms we were taught about in french class :d we used to make fun of it , because dom-tom , literally means `` dumb tom '' in dutch .
