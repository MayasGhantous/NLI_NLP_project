  that fourth bullet point though :'), 
  you take some land , send your own people there and then let them decide , how selfless and democratic :d, 
  why would they ? 
  do europeans care more about american politics than their own ? 
   i was invited to join the freemasons by my uncle , and one rule of the freemasons is that you have to acknowledge a higher power . 
  have you read the lost symbol by dan brown ? 
   do you believe in one or more god ( s ) ? 
   are you a member of a religious society ? 
  ( church of england , folkekirken , etc. ), 
   do you ever say a prayer , meditate , etc ? 
   whether or not you go to a church/mosque/temple etc. 
  or not , do you perceive yourself as ... atheist , but if someone comes up with a convincing story that might change , has n't happened to me yet . 
   what is your general perception of religion ? 
  i just do n't understand . 
  i can understand why people would want to believe it 's true , but i ca n't understand people actually do . 
  or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80ipaexlu-c ) ? 
  the people were so nice and welcoming , they were genuinely interested in where i came from . 
  a family even came up to me and apologised after some mad man started shouting stuff about jesus on the streets . 
  the national mall in d.c. has great museums , standing at the gate of the white house is pretty surreal . 
  train travelling was okay , but not that convenient ( not that many options , malfunctioning airco during a heat wave , little room for your luggage ) , but we were treated well by amtrak staff . 
  i did n't expect supermarkets in new york city ( or manhattan in particular ) to be * that * expensive , going out for diner was cheaper than buying groceries . 
  new york itself was great , it has impressive museums and i especially enjoyed the great views ( at night ) standing on top of one of those skyscrapers . 
  there 's no city in europe that compares to new york in that sense . 
  you 're not making sense , i 'm not part of the dutch circlejerk . 
  ah , because that 's how it 's pronounced in dutch if it were a dutch word . 
  get it . 
  said the german garbage patch . 
  more of less . 
  i mean , there 's no denying i live in europe , but i feel just as much connected to canada as let 's say lithuania . 
  that does n't however mean that i do n't support european integration . 
  stop imitating our flag  . <, 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  that must be the most italian-english accent i 've heard and she 's not even italian . 
  - the *, 
  my sleepdrunk , dumb brain actually thought your second pick was wikipedia . 
  i was like , they made a film about wikipedia ? 
  you 're confused , you were born in croatia , not turkey . 
   it was meant to be a joke . 
  germans are oblivious to those . 
  it 's not always easy for family or friends to say something at a funeral . 
  if you 're really close family , you really do n't care about fancy rituals or funny people . 
  i reckon it can be boring for more distant invitees . 
  not to be rude or call you out , but what kind of exciting things do you expect at a funeral ? 
  a french-belgian nationalist , come on , go all out . 
  have you thought about your own government , they might provide some kind of support or scholarships for citizens studying ( abroad ) ? 
  i think it 's a powerful platform to hear from , and interact with , all kinds of ` ordinary ' people . 
  when i think of eastern europe , i no longer think of this far away place with foreign people that you only ever read about in the media or history books . 
  they 've become more like neighbours , members of a community with whom you share a continent and often even a political union , currency and external border . 
  it 's pretty odd how we know ( or rather knew ) so little about each other . 
  why did he get to attend the conference , because the other nations hired him as a speaker or could it be because he was the king of belgium ? 
  if he 's also the king of the netherlands , then we do . 
  because it 's such an amazing city , i for one think it 's one of the most beautiful cities in europe . 
  on top of that it 's fairly cheap and two days of walking is enough to see most of the ( many ! ), 
  highlights . 
  i 'd recommend prague if that 's possible . 
  ask somebody else to fill in the form ? 
  since the netherlands is basically a flat country with lots of meadows , this is about as exciting as it gets : * [ nationaal park de hoge veluwe ] ( https://www.knac.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/landschap__het_nationale_park_de_hoge_veluwe.jpg ) * [ nationaal park de loonse en drunense duinen ] ( http://thumbs.werkaandemuur.nl/92c9cb115e9c95a9e5e76288c958d9de_950x600_fit.jpg ) * [ nationaal park utrechtse heuvelrug ] ( http://bbdewillemshoeve.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/achtergrondbeeld.jpg ), 
  then you clearly do n't know what a sjw is . 
  there 's progressives , and there 's sjws , they 're not the same . 
  the word you 're looking for is * liberal * . 
   leopold fervently believed that overseas colonies were the key to a country 's greatness , and he worked tirelessly to acquire colonial territory for belgium . 
  leopold eventually began to acquire a colony as a private citizen . 
  the belgian government lent him money for this venture . 
  leopold ii being the king of belgium and acquiring congo are inextricably linked . 
  it 's the same excuse every pre-democracy country could come up with . 
  it 's however a fact that if leopold was n't the king of belgium and did n't have access to an army , he would n't have been able to lay his hand on congo . 
  this is a rather poor excuse . 
  yeah , but mussert is a rather boring pick . 
  that would be either [ balthasar g\u00e9rard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balthasar_g\u00e9rard ) , the assassin of prince william of orange , the leader that led our country to independence from the spaniards , or [ anton mussert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anton_mussert ) , leader of the nsb party that collaborated with the nazi regime during wwii . 
  not in the netherlands . 
  i 'd say football , hockey , tennis , cycling and perhaps volleyball . 
  honourable mention : ice skating during winter time . 
  i 'm gon na cheat , i have a german [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/drfsxlchrwc ) for you . 
  this sums up the netherlands pretty well . 
  so much frustration , glad you can let it all out on reddit . 
  burger = civilian = a dutch loanword , thought you were referring to lower class citizens , but obviously you were just name calling . 
   blooper so this is what being russian feels like . 
  of course , but if you 're white there 's even less doubt , as there 's not many white countries outside of europe that have immigrants living in europe . 
  i 've got to ask though , ts , is [ this ] ( https://irenewillbite.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/l_15870ac2f4ea8b3e25343d8b09528028.jpg ) you ? 
  well then you could pass for a northern european , nothing to worry about . 
  well it 's pretty clear if you 're not white , but even greeks and danes do n't look alike so for all i know you could be an italian :d, 
  how would people even notice you 're not european ? 
  it 's also american english . 
  i deleted my post , because it contained a false statement . 
  i do n't speak french , but in school we were taught to use a partitive article whenever a noun did not have an article in dutch , hence my mistake . 
  i hope and think it will never happen , but i would n't blame america if it did . 
  europe needs to step up its game , because right know it ca n't even defend its own external borders . 
  having 27 different armies is just extremely inefficient so there 's actually lots to gain . 
  even making some regional armies with countries in europe that are more alike would make a big difference ( a nordic army , a benelux army , an iberian army , etc. 
  i 'm not an expert on dutch flag history so yeah , perhaps that 's one of the reasons . 
  oops , my bad . 
  still , draft is another way of spelling it , so i guess we 're both ` idiots ' . 
  our flag is an adaptation of the [ statenvlag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statenvlag ) , which was the flag of the county of holland and resembles the current flag of luxembourg . 
  during the war against the spaniards , we changed the red banner into orange , because the revolt was led by the prince of orange ( it was called the [ prince 's flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince%27s_flag ) ) . 
  this is also the reason why the current [ flag of new york ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/flag_of_new_york_city.svg ) ( new amsterdam ) and the [ former flag of south-africa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/flag_of_south_africa_%281928-1994%29.svg ) are and were orange/white/blue . 
  the orange eventually changed back to red ( possibly because merchants still used the old red/white/blue flag ) and the flag settled to its current form . 
  the guardian is just as biased and ridiculous at times , but in their case they 're on the other side of the political spectrum . 
  i do n't even know myself . 
  y' all better get on [ ukraine 's level ] ( https://youtu.be/xqclanucp24?t=1m18s ) , damn . 
  the chorus ( if you could call it that ) , sounds slightly dutch , it 's as if he sings : * allemaal pitten , kop dicht !,
