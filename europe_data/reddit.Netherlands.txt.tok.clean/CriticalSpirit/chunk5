  edit : [ i made a list for more european countries !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51to0u/what_europe_searches_about_the_uk/d7ewlza ), 
  oh , do n't get me wrong , it 's only a small group of brits , mostly men . 
  nobody believes all brits are ugly , but some men have this down syndrome look without having down syndrome if you know what i mean . 
  i do n't feel like posting an example , because that would be rude . 
  google it and you 'll find out i 'm not the only one thinking this . 
  do n't take this personal , i have nothing against brits , they 're great people . 
  why ? 
  i feel embarrassed for having indeed searched that . 
  i guess most people are simpletons when it comes to the legality of apple 's tax deal . 
   what europeans ? 
  i surely do n't want to have a say in ireland 's tax policy and countries have full sovereignty over their own tax policies ( ireland in particular even made sure oh , so now you 're a european ? 
  you claimed to be an american earlier on . 
  anyway , i would definitely want to have a say in european taxing policies ( corporate tax ) that greatly affect my country 's tax income , even though my country is n't a good example as it 's pretty much a tax haven itself , but you get the idea . 
   talk for yourself . 
  i surely would rather see governments competing fiscally than cooperating . 
  and i 'd rather see apple , and every other corporation , paying 0 in taxes . 
  people who defend the corporate income tax are illiterate know-nothings . 
  the old ` corporations can not be taxed , they 're translucent ' - fallacy ? 
  you 're mainly taxing share holders ( and unfortunately to some degree employees ) , the first in my view being a good thing as those tend to be more wealthy individuals . 
   are they ? 
  plus , the incidence of the corporate income tax falls mostly upon the employees . 
  it 's a highly regressive tax ( and it 'd be even if it was entirely paid by shareholders , as an old lady with a few stocks , a pension fund and a super-billionaire would all pay the same percentage ) that affects first and foremost ordinary citizens . 
  oh , there you go , i did n't have to type it out . 
  most ordinary citizens do n't directly own shares , and those who do so indirectly ( e.g. 
  through pension funds ) will be better off due to lower income tax rates , rates that are mostly progressive . 
   and this is why venezuela , portugal , mongolia and other high-tax jurisdictions have much better infrastructure and social security systems than switzerland , singapore and chile . 
  the poor economic state of venezuela , portugal and mongolia has little to do with their tax policies . 
  smaller government means smaller social security . 
  private corporations are not going to provide social security you know , it 's not feasible . 
   a protectionist european union , that would restrict trade , perhaps would n't be dumb from the perspective of someone like you , but will be a lot poorer . 
  poorer , but it will have its wealth shared more equally among its citizens . 
  and we could do without the insulting you know , it does n't make for a better argument . 
   this ruling is unfair . 
  - harvard professor of law and public policy  this ruling is unfair . 
  - tim cook , ceo of apple the messenger * does * matter . 
  for first generations , it 's tolerable , but it obstructs integration/assimilation for next generations . 
  there are far too many people in the netherlands that hold turkish/moroccan passports because their grandparents grew up there . 
  they themselves and their parents were born and raised in the netherlands , it 's ridiculous . 
   you can have both a european passport and a foreign one , it 's totally legal . 
  a practice that has to end .
