  * ( all go to sleep , shut your mouth ! ), 
  which makes it quite amusing , but yeah , why even send this ? 
  some honourable mentions from the netherlands : * 2009 - [ de toppers - shine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mr3w2fm7_e ) * 2006 - [ treble - amambanda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmk4h4sffim ), 
  the accent is strong in this one . 
  there 's something seriously wrong if [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4y0hopl5gu ) is not even mentioned as one of finland 's worst entries . 
  i expected more from it . 
  back when bad vocals did not stand in your way of getting selected . 
  yeah , that seems to be pretty much our [ thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnctsakrir4 ) ... 
  that 80s coat really does it for me xd, 
  so cheesy haha . 
  never have i ever seen a ukrainian flair . 
   that can truly be difficult , but catalonia is not a borderline case , it 's a very clear-cut case of falling into that category , which is why i support them . 
  what if every rich part of a nation would secede , would n't that be kind of selfish ? 
  quit the sarcasm , you did n't provide this information in your first post , so it could have easily been unrelated to racism . 
  i rarely ever listen to dutch music , but there 's one band that comes to mind : bl\u00f8f . 
  * [ bl\u00f8f - dansen aan zee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwr5l3jfehe ) ( dancing at the sea ) * [ bl\u00f8f - liefs uit londen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am5ju0juoss ) ( much love from london ) * [ bl\u00f8f - aan de kust ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isjbveumxps ) ( at the coast ), 
  every country in europe that has signed the echr ( practically every nation ) has the same definition . 
  belgium : funny southern accent , beautiful cities , political chaos . 
  germany : their language is easy for us to follow , big country so do n't really feel close to them for some reason , might be because berlin is pretty far away . 
  fluently : dutch . 
  advanced level : english . 
  fairly well : german , french . 
  dutch , english and either french or german are mandatory in the highest variant of secondary education . 
  dutch and english are the bare minimum for every variant . 
  some schools offer spanish , chinese or another language instead of french/german . 
  in friesland , some schools offer frisian . 
  there 's not that many tourists though , it 's not overcrowded , at least not when i was there in high summer . 
  why leave nato once we have our own strong military ? 
  i actually think that 'd be quite rude considering they 've always helped us and i 'd gladly defend the us and canada in case they 're under attack . 
   it says `` reservations are an additional cost '' and all thalys and tgv are reservation only ( plus i thought they might be too fancy for bikes ) so just assumed they were out , but i have n't looked into it enough . 
  if you go from amsterdam to brussels , you can take the [ intercity to brussels ] ( https://www.nsinternational.nl/en/trains/intercity-brussels ) instead . 
  this train departs 16 times a day and does not require reservations or extra fees . 
  this journey will take slightly longer than the thalys however but lasts no more than three hours . 
  i 'm positive it 's covered by your eurail ticket . 
  ns seems to be the operator and they are covered under eurail . 
  within belgium , eurail covers nmbs which is the main ( if not only , they might have a monopoly ? ), 
  provider of train services , so no problems in belgium . 
  this [ website ] ( http://www.belgianrail.be/nl/stations-en-trein/fiets.aspx ) of nmbs says it charges extra for bringing bikes , however folding bikes ( vouwfietsen ) require no extra charge !, 
   i 've already got my place for 6 nights in brussels which would have a charge to alter . 
  i had figured on leaving early morning with the bike to take the train to bruges/ghent/antwerp and coming back in the evening . 
  figured 2 days in brussels plus 3 in the others still leaves me with a day to spare . 
  do n't get me wrong , brussels is plenty of fun . 
  spend some time in the european quarter which seats the european parliament , european commission and european council . 
  visit the atomium . 
  underneath the atomium there 's a small [ theme park ] ( http://www.minieurope.com/en/ ) that features tiny replicas of every eu capital . 
   i 'm generally not a battlefield kind of person ( and guessing that bringing a bike is probably bad form ) , i generally like unesco site type stuff but if you think it 's worthwhile i might check it out . 
  me neither . 
  if you 're into cycling , you might be interested in the ardennes , perhaps dinant or la roche . 
  another option would be to visit luxembourg . 
  something i would definitely recommend is visiting rotterdam in the netherlands . 
  this city really stands out compared to your typical dutch/belgian city , for it was bombed in wwii and rebuilt using modern style architecture . 
  it features one heritage site ( [ van nelle factory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/van_nelle_factory ) ) , but that 's not even worth visiting , the city itself is more impressive . 
  this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pv3dzrknec ) provides some bird-eye views of the city . 
  i 'm not really an expert on train traveling between belgium and france , because i mainly travel by car across the continent , so i ca n't really help you with that . 
  i know the thalys goes there , but i 'm not aware of other ( less formal ) train options , though i 'm certain they exist . 
  that 's quite depressing . 
  i think it 's called island syndrome . 
  i would actually favour vienna if we had to pick one european capital . 
  it 's centrally located , functions as a bridge between western and eastern europe and on top of that it 's a beautiful city . 
  i guess it 's not very easy and efficient to move all facilities though , so brussels it is . 
  although i 'm not so sure the belgians will say the same , but in the end we speak the same language ( not french and german , i know ) and broadly share the same history . 
  kind of like a love-hate relationship . 
  could you be more specific as to what train services you 're going to use ? 
  what do you mean by :  i 'm looking at the `` 8 days in 2 months benelux + germany '' 2nd class package for $ 431 but do n't know if this is best for what i want to do . 
  different train operators tend to have different rules . 
  the ns rules ( as explained by / u/vaaag ) do not necessarily apply to the thalys train service . 
  although you will most likely have no trouble traveling by train with a folding bike . 
  is your itinerary already fixed , because i would suggest spending less time in brussels . 
  brussels itself is fine for a day or two , and bruges/ghent/antwerp can all be covered in one day ( edit : one day each of course ) . 
  if you 're really keen on staying in brussels you could consider more historical sites like waterloo ( battlefield where napoleon was defeated ) or ypres ( wwi battlefield ) . 
  just contact your provider and ask if they offer international bundles ? 
  most movies would still be made so i ca n't like them ? 
  what kind of argument is that ? 
  gosh ... and like / = / does it affect my standard of living . 
  just the fact that you go to any length to show how you really really really do n't like anything american shows how arrogant you are . 
  seems to me like you had some bad experiences and now hold a grudge towards the us . 
  * making blockbuster movies . 
  * every building is wheelchair accessible ( this is mandatory ) . 
  * you get more for your money . 
  * far better customer service . 
  * people are generally more friendly and approachable . 
  just to name a few . 
  there 's lots to like ( and hate ) about america , saying they do nothing better or implying there 's nothing to like about america because of that is mere arrogance . 
   meaning they do n't do anything better . 
  which is bs . 
  besides , the question was ` what do you like about america ? 
  ' , not ` do you think america is inferior to europe ? 
  canada , because it seems to have the best of both worlds . 
  it has this european feel to it , especially qu\u00e9bec , while at the same time there are cool typical american style cities , with lots of skyscrapers . 
  the people are friendly , the wilderness rocks and it 's close to a lot of great us cities !, 
  i think this is particularly rude and uncalled for . 
  as if you ca n't name one or two positive things about north-america . 
  it 's a pretty and historical city , yet quite small in my opinion . 
  i have actually only been there four times , i rather visit paris . 
  but north-america has great nature and cool modern cities , it 's unique in its own way , which makes it a pretty cool place . 
  which was communism , socialism in the modern sense , the way it 's used in american politics / = / communism . 
  i 'd say that 's a very pre-1990s definition , because today it 's fairly accurate to say scandinavian countries have adopted a socialist system . 
   socialist as in the traditional meaning of the collective ownership of the means of production ? 
  that 's communism , socialism is less extreme . 
  every experience in europe will be different , since europe is such a diverse continent .
