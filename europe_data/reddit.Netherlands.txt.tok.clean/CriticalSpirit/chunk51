  i 'm a european myself , yet i feel like a child in a candy store whenever i drive around the continent , there 's simply so much to discover . 
  i am certain it was leopold ii , he had pretty detailed [ plans ] ( http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf24062009_010 ) to invade the netherlands . 
  pretty awesome i think . 
  it 's a relatively small issue . 
  swiss newspaper , referenda are sacred over there , 
  57 % turnout is actually pretty high for a referendum . 
  paris is still one of the most beautiful cities in europe , they just have to get rid of the beggars and islamic threat . 
  totally agree with you on this , saying holland is fine and not something to get upset about . 
  leopold ii actually had plans to invade the netherlands , what a thug . 
  the city centre was destroyed by nazi-germany so it 's now one of the most modern cities in europe . 
  there 's lots of contemporary architecture and skyscrapers . 
  something you wo n't find in amsterdam . 
  you 'll either love or hate it . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.componistdesvaderlands.nl/user-files/uploads/2015/04/centrum1946_rotterdam.jpg ) is a picture of the city centre after it was bombed . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.evangelicalendtimemachine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/centraal-station-rotterdam.jpg ) is what it looks like 75 years later . 
  try to find the church of the first picture on the second one !, 
  i ca n't speak for my country , but personally i used to think eastern european cities were pretty much poor no-go areas with angry soviets/communists and full of ugly soviet flats and boring rectangular buildings . 
  i was actually surprised by the beauty of your cities . 
  krakow , prague and budapest are all beautiful cities . 
  prague really is the paris of central-europe . 
  correct , which makes him even more of a socialist in dutch politics . 
  the first one made me laugh and i like the message of the second song . 
  you got me there :d, 
  sure you can . 
  the first one is really beautiful . 
  italians are lucky they have such a beautiful language !, 
  that 's because that 's the best he could get in the us , he would definitely not reduce ours . 
  there are even entire websites devoted to jokes about the belgians . 
  here 's a [ popular dutch youtuber ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjdm3taxnrg ) making a vlog about jokes targeting belgians , it includes a belgian youtuber . 
  in the end of course , it 's just fun , no hard feelings . 
  russia is a major political and militaristic power that 's not worth getting in trouble with over minor issues like crimea or a gay law . 
  i know people will downvote me for saying this , but it 's probably one of the reasons . 
  another reason might be that they see russia as an ally in the fight against islamic extremism , more so than let 's say turkey . 
  yes , pretty accurate . 
  why do you think bernie would want to weaken environmental regulations or lower the minimum wage ? 
  lots of british/irish music , but i do n't think that 's very special . 
  besides that i like listening to stromae ( be ) and ma\u00eetre gims ( fr ) . 
  especially stromae though , he 's a true artist . 
  i grew up listening to abba , europe and roxette ( se ) , but also nena ( de ) . 
  there 's got to be quite a few other artists that i ca n't think of right now . 
  a lot of spanish ( and later portuguese ) jews actually migrated to the low countries ( nl+be ) . 
  that 's how [ spinoza ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baruch_spinoza ) ended up being a dutchman , born in amsterdam . 
  really ? 
  i thought ` sauna ' was a finnish invention . 
  well you should have some consistency . 
  if you switch back and forth between british-english and american-english every other sentence , it will look odd and unprofessional . 
  we probably all listen to english music , but i wondered : what song in your own language gives you goosebumps or makes you feel proud ? 
  for me it 's really hard to find good songs , because dutch is very guttural which sounds awful to a lot of people ( even some dutchies ) . 
  i came up with these two that i think sound pretty nice , you know , for a dutch song . 
  * [ glennis grace - afscheid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsoyzlkhxj8 ) * [ marco borsato - de bestemming ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qinabexzuty ) please try to limit the amount of songs you list and provide us with a youtube link so we can all enjoy !, 
  let me start , we 've had some really bad years up until recently , but i 'll go with this one . 
  [ 2010 - sieneke - ik ben verliefd ( sha la lie ) ] ( https://youtu.be/-vzfwfcx4hq ), 
  my earliest recollection of a holiday abroad was one to denmark , i was about 3/4 years old . 
  i remember strolling along shores full of ( in my eyes ) exotic stones and wondered why those shores were n't just sandy and yellow like at home ( i lived near the coast ) . 
  i also remember going to legoland . 
  be it a natural park , a historic site , a cool city outlook or simple hometown glory . 
  what is the coolest google streetview spot in your country ? 
  and also , what do you consider to be the coolest spot in europe in general ? 
  please post links so we can see !, 
  perhaps you said something negative about a bystander , or had an obscure conversation knowing the people around you would n't be able to understand you . 
  also , is this perhaps more of a small language thing ? 
  you have to be rather careful with this if you speak german , french or spanish because chances are at least someone will understand you . 
  even i am careful , because there 's so many dutch/belgian tourists abroad . 
  i 'm looking for business districts that are unique or just impressive from cities other than the likes of london , moscow , frankfurt or paris . 
  they 're awesome , we get it . 
  now i , for one , was pleasently surprised by the districts in [ warsaw ] ( http://www.worldpropertyjournal.com/news-assets/warsaw-skyline-poland.jpg ) , [ naples ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/centro_direzionale_-_napoli.jpg ) and [ oslo ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/downtown_oslo_norway_skyline.png ) . 
  do you have something to share from your own country ? 
  there is no criterion , impressive can mean whatever you want it to mean !, 
  do you often spot the european flag in places other than government buildings and hotels in your country ? 
  is it a common sight ? 
  please share streetview examples of ordinary places that wave the flag !, 
  an example : this [ hairdresser 's ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@51.6493794,3.9190824,3a,75y,39.28h,94.56t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sfq_pg_sndzoj_pqnqcgptq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) in a small village in the province of zeeland . 
  when looking at a map or travelling around the country , i am often shocked by how small we really are . 
  it makes me feel insignificant and faintly claustrophobic even . 
  in world news or politics we barely play a role and our influence even within europe is not that of a leading nation . 
  nobody abroad will learn our language or history , and domestic news is often so trivial . 
  are there any upsides to being a small nation ? 
  just to be sure : i do n't dislike my country , it 's just that it 's so small . 
  eastern european countries like poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovakia are against redistributing migrants/refugees , and ( let 's be honest ) are against any form of migration from africa and the middle east . 
  if that 's the case then why does n't eastern europe team up and propose measures to stop the influx of immigrants from mena countries ? 
  why do n't you start negotiating deals with african countries or propose military measures to return migrant boats to libya ? 
  why not make these proposals in the european council and get behind them ? 
  if all of eastern europe gets behind it , it would be hard for germany , sweden and a handful of other countries to simply dismiss those solutions . 
  it would also give your resistance against the redistribution of migrants more legitimacy and i am certain the general population in western europe would be in favour of measures to reduce the influx as well , especially in countries like denmark , finland and the netherlands . 
  why are you ( and we ) so lenient toward what germany wants ? 
  do they broadcast the tour in your country and do people generally watch it ? 
  if you yourself do , why ? 
  explain the pictures of erdogan with `` terrorist '' g\u00fclen ... 
  if you yourself hold a degree in history you should know you can not apply modern day context to historic events . 
  easy for you to say it was obvious the germans were going to use the registers to exterminate all jews , but back then , the germans did n't even know that themselves . 
  ` please educate yourself ' was a nice way of saying you were uttering complete bullshit . 
  on this scale , because the killing of jews on any other scale was not known to western governments in 1940 . 
  the only killings that took place were ss death squats in occupied eastern european territory and this was not yet organised or systematic . 
  western european governments were not aware of this , hell they were n't even aware of the death camps until very late in the war . 
  please educate yourself , germany did n't exterminate jews on this scale until 1942 . 
  because obviously everyone was well aware the germans would use the municipality registers to systematically extinguish all jews back in 1940 , destroying civil registers is not a standard procedure in case of a war . 
  are you seriously comparing the red army and the resources of the soviet union to the dutch kingdom whose last war was in the 1830s ? 
   i 'm open anout my secuality to every muslim immigrant i meet . 
  great , where was that , the safe environment of a university campus or city centre ? 
   an ironic one too , considering right wing politicians have been the ones who denied them their rights for the longest time .
