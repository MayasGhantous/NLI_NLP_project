  because they know all too well turkey is shit economically . 
  thank your fellow countrymen who are mostly backwards idiots . 
  they are the problem to begin with . 
  you know none of this is to be taken seriously , it 's said jokingly , people are not dead serious about it . 
  this would be the first disney movie with a ` gay moment ' , i 'm not sure whether i would consider that ultra liberal . 
  sgp having substantial influence on budget politics during rutte i , because the coalition lacked majority support in the senate . 
  it does hinder coalition-building and it gives small parties disproportional power . 
   germany has even suspended family reunification , and people still vote for afd . 
  the great wave they 're fantasizing about is already over . 
  do you really just not understand that the fear of migration does not only stem from the migration itself , also the ( long-term ) effects ? 
  the situation in italy is still a very active process , so is the process of family reunification all over europe . 
  those are not ` details ' . 
  what 's wrong with 2x2 lanes ? 
  i know right , what an awful [ display of public nudity ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/bruxelles_manneken_pis_cropped.jpg/266px-bruxelles_manneken_pis_cropped.jpg ) !, 
  i do n't mind scottish independence , but i much rather have them await the results of the negotiation process . 
  this is just a political game and i do n't think the scots will have any of that . 
  that looks like the flag of somalia , i much prefer the yellow colour . 
  i do n't really understand this , perhaps it 's more elaborative , but schools in the netherlands have been obliged to teach about lgbt acceptance since 2012 , also after a vote in parliament . 
  apart from what it may or may not stand for , i actually think the design is pretty cool and simple . 
  i also like the dark blue/yellow contrast . 
  definitely do n't mind [ waving that flag alongside the dutch flag ] ( http://www.denieuwsmakers.nl/afbeeldingen/europesevlag01x4100.jpg ) . 
  just like ghent actually . 
  turkey is also in nato , that is what makes this so absurd . 
   we also sung this : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8fjywbcv_8e very popular in the netherlands as well , even made our [ own ( worse ) version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjnd007tqlg ) . 
  oh boy , that greek set me up !, 
  do n't i ? 
  i have found my long lost family line . 
  the americas are a total mix of people , i do n't think there will be a distinct regional spread other than that places with a high percentage of white people will have more people with light eyes . 
  when it comes to the middle east i know of some places like afghanistan where green eyes are common . 
  do n't know much else though . 
  what ? 
  it coincides with [ this map ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-z0vsazia2ni/u0_34o9fxdi/aaaaaaaaate/vuw7j4lduws/s1600/europe-eyes-general--lig.png ) . 
  i was blond for the first 10 years of my life , then i turned pitch-dark :') people do n't even recognise me on photos of me as a kid . 
  great idea and a nice effort , yet you did fuck up our flag ^ and ^ those ^ of ^ luxembourg , ^ estonia ^ and ^ france . 
  our gdp equals that of africa ? 
  i doubt that . 
  hi , i 'm a lawyer specialized in public international law . 
  i could n't help but notice you have some difficulties getting your country recognised . 
  it is my professional opinion that you should take your case to the international court of justice and that you should pay me to represent you there . 
  dm me to work out the details !, 
  do n't get me wrong , i support paris , but would have been nice to see some countries that are less likely to get in the picture get their moment , like budapest . 
  it had n't gotten the same kind of attention , because most people would n't care . 
  she 's been an inspiration , even for today 's british youth . 
  yet you had some winter olympics , fifa '98 and just last year euro 2016 . 
  the last olympics in the overwhelming majority of countries was * never * , i would encourage new countries to participate in the bidding process . 
  we were in for fifa 2018/2022 , but we did n't offer enough bribes . 
  true , the netherlands alone has a gdp that is higher than turkey 's . 
  the benelux has a gdp larger than russia 's . 
  so the same old cities will compete , such a shame . 
   and people are surprised when many ~ ~ brits ~ ~ englishmen say they do n't feel european . 
  that is definitely a factor , but i think it has more to do with delusions of grandeur . 
  the irish and scots do n't feel like that , neither do people from iceland , cyprus , malta or the faroe islands . 
  i was surprised the only language i understood was an african language , 
  they 're so close yet so far away . 
  i live 300 kilometers from london , but it feels like it 's on the other side of the continent , because i ca n't easily get there by car . 
  they are a seafaring and trading nation , just like us . 
  we used to share a king . 
  i feel you , dutch hardly ever gets mentioned in these type of videos , but czech even less so . 
  was waiting for my native language to come up , then afrikaans passed by and it was the exact same as dutch so not disappointed . 
  this is not about results , this is about being racist or not , that 's what matters most in 21st century politics . 
  then people should have voted differently in the past 40 years . 
  okay , so he wants to transfer more power from parliament to the people , that 's indeed worrisome and fascist ? 
   and i 'm not exaggerating here yes you are , there were no such things as concentration camps in the netherlands , merely transport camps ( doorvoerkampen ) . 
  the moluccans were housed in the barracks of these camps , because there was a lack of housing after wwii . 
   current trends in far-right extremism also prove volkert van der graaf right . 
  if anything van der graaf created wilders , a much more radical figure than fortuyn would have ever been . 
  van der graaf is a left-wing extremist himself , he was not ` right ' . 
  ... you complain about eurovision being political . 
  now that we 're out of the eu , teaching of the imperial system will no longer be banned !, 
  the [ local bar ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.7848916,4.8544357,3a,90y,210.27h,76.73t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sj_-2hqusaxqaaaq1wyxc2g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) looks beautiful . 
  france , je t ` aime ... 
  the dutch language also has its own [ language board ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_language_union ) , but unlike the french one , it does n't actively try to keep loan words out . 
  why are the french so insecure about their language ? 
  edit : the downvoting pretty much proves my point . 
  that would actually be a very good idea , never thought about that solution . 
  the bus was not part of his campaign though . 
  `` europe '' had to bond , but not the uk , only the continentals needed a common government to keep them from waging war . 
  i feel that 's belittling . 
   he said great britain should be with , but not of it which is utterly offensive . 
  what a baby , tough enough to kill innocent people in syria , but too much of a coward to stay in syria after incurring a head injury . 
  this scum should face a life sentence . 
  it does n't , but it puts ` we were the biggest slave transporters ' into perspective . 
  yet black africans were the biggest slave traders . 
   you have soldiers in every city . 
  outside of france this used to be a very rare image , and it still is in many places . 
  up until recently there were no soldiers in brussels for example . 
  yeah , that 's their excuse , the real reason is they 're a bunch of futureless street scum that think vandalism is warranted because they hate authority . 
  some folks are really bad at comprehending written language it seems . 
  honestly , he should have stepped down after brexit . 
  nobody except for some people in luxembourg voted for him , he has little legitimacy . 
  we should change the way eu elections work . 
   but i 've sort of got used to it in the other cities i 've visited like prague and vienna where they permanently have a police van parked next to major attractions . 
  in paris though , you will see [ soldiers marching with firearms ] ( http://news.images.itv.com/image/file/825003/stream_img.jpg ) , but they have been around for more than a decade now . 
  i have been to paris countless times and their presence has never really bothered me much , but it does n't make me feel safe either , makes you aware of the fact that you 're at a target location which is not something you want to think about . 
  just try to enjoy it though , paris is still a wonderful city with amazing museums and how i just love every building in the city center , so gorgeous . 
  [ see for yourself , enjoy !,

  we get snow [ a couple of times each winter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jqr8cm-6x4 ) , less so near the coast though . 
  every five years or so , it gets [ intense ] ( http://hollandski.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/veelsneeuw.jpg ) .
