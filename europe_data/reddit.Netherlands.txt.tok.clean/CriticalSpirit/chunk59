  born to a german-turkish citizen in germany ? 
  you will have to choose either one . 
  i have quite some cash at home , but i never use it . 
  i often have to force myself to pay in cash otherwise i will never get rid of it . 
  neither is it just a common market . 
  the eu is much more than that . 
  our `` colonies '' voted to be part of the kingdom or even the netherlands itself in 2010 . 
  besides , this is about separating a colony , deporting part of the population and keeping the part you separated for yourself against the will of the local population . 
  i do n't think i 'm exaggerating when i say that most people ca n't even name one dutch mep . 
  a swiss party in the european parliament ? 
  also , i 'm not trying to argue that politicians personally answer all their emails , but i do n't see why it 's somehow impossible that they answer some themselves . 
  it was a mosque , but yes it could have been much worse . 
  i think you 're greatly overestimating the number of emails citizens send to their meps . 
  this genuinely seems to be written by him . 
  whenever a politician does n't answer himself , you 'll often see something like '' [ [ politician ] ] has asked me to answer your question '' and they would avoid using ` i ' . 
  which was throwing a molotov cocktail through a window which , however awful , can not be compared to jihadist attacks that kill dozens . 
  ukraine is not in the eu . 
   the jihadis ' targets in europe are depressingly repetitive : the brussels metro , the champs-elysees in paris ( twice ) , tourist-filled bridges in london ( twice ) and a ** u.k. rock concert ** . 
  til ariana grande makes rock music . 
  why would n't you compare nrw to the netherlands ? 
  it 's about equal in geographical and population size . 
  would it make sense to compare the netherlands to vatican city just because both are countries ? 
  just stop doggin ' me around . 
  source : [ world bank ] ( http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/6.14 ), 
  well , is it okay to call it afrikaans ( = african ) ? 
  it 's just as weird imo . 
  paraplu and parasol are used in dutch . 
  without looking , is it the one about the subtitles ? 
  before wwi , european economies were nowhere near as intertwined as they are now . 
  i would have agreed 10 years ago , now i 'm not so sure . 
  [ what 's the use of having a fence if people that climb over it are not deported ? 
  ] ( https://www.cartoonmovement.com/depot/cartoons/2015/09/01/on_the_fence__marian_kamensky.jpeg ), 
  so let 's fly over 31 million afghanis , how naive can you be ? 
  there 's millions of afghanis , there 's thousands of terror deaths . 
  it 's still highly unlikely you will die in a terror attack , even in afghanistan . 
  eurocrats have installed a wind machine that 's blowing iberian air to the british isles !, 
  mine were revoked when i asked a question about mh17 . 
  for no reason whatsoever , why are people wasting their money on this ? 
  they said the same thing when a political party wanted to ban the ritual slaughter of unstunned animals . 
  in my opinion the suffering of animals is far more important than the freedom to believe in a fairytale . 
   male sons as opposed to female sons ? 
   she has n't brought it up since . 
  it would be kind of weird if your mom was still obsessed with what her adult son 's penis looks like . 
  german-belgian relations are closer because they 're between native speakers , it 's not like french speaking walloons are more likely to speak german than dutch people are . 
  it has also not been my experience that walloons speak better english than the french , but i trust you have had more experience with that than me . 
  it 's true though that the dutch will overstate their language skills and that flemish people on average will have far better french skills . 
  in my experience the people in flanders speak dutch , english and have a good understanding of french , but in wallonia , even though young people will know some english , not many people speak any other language besides french . 
  it could be that wallonia is dragging flanders down . 
  i also think the number of people speaking german in the border regions in the netherlands is higher than expected , my parents are fluent in german because they grew up near the border ( they only had german tv ) . 
  it makes for a more juicy story , i get that . 
  we are currently building a [ new office ] ( http://sevenoaks.eu/sites/default/files/seven%20oaks-detachering-rijswijk-european%20patent%20office-nieuwbouw-1.jpg ) for the european patent office in rijswijk ( near the hague ) , i guess we could opt for an expansion !, 
  acted in what way ? 
  refusing to be used as a punching bag ? 
  why would you visit an emotionally unstable mob just to get yelled at ? 
  those people are not thinking rationally , which you ca n't blame them for , but i think a pm has better things to do than to be screamed and yelled at . 
  apparently we 're sending over 270 soldiers to lithuania as well , but i guess we 're too small to be relevant for a news story . 
  why is nobody talking about him supposedly being 128 years old ? 
  the oldest man to have ever lived was 116 . 
  what what ? 
  no use in being a punshing bag , rather work on actual solutions that will help those affected . 
  obviously not the people living in that flat , kensington has many rich residents , but they 're not living in that part . 
  honestly , that 's like labour heartland , just showing her face is enough to get called names . 
  i would n't bother going there at all , not with emotions running this high . 
  they 're not protesters though , the queen 's talking to survivors i suppose . 
  the sanctions are meant to put some pressure on the russian government , not to make the russian or eu economy collapse . 
  it saves me about $ 25 this summer , worth something to me . 
  my provider said switzerland was not included , because their tariffs are too expensive . 
   example : with his $ 70 ( $ 57.85 excl . 
  vat ) per month contract , tim , living in the netherlands , gets unlimited calls , texts and data for his smartphone . 
  tim is getting ripped off . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  if you actually want to see [ flower fields ] ( http://static.magazine.nationalgeographic.nl/thumbnails/genjgallerybundle/item/fileupload/big/00/10/09/top-10-mooiste-bloemenvelden-8-1009.jpg ) , you must visit the [ bollenstreek ] ( http://www.fietslabyrint.nl/fietstochten/pictures/82_kaart.jpg ) around april . 
  that 's how many in the west look at eastern europe though . 
  [ you mean this ? 
  ] ( https://www.plusonline.nl/sites/plusonline/files/nederland.jpg ) [ or this ? 
  ] ( http://www.travelsentry.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/holland.jpg ), 
  they 're also not part of the scheme . 
  those are guestworkers , economical refugees . 
  but they wo n't form a government with vvd , so they 're out of the game for many years to come if that continues to be their stance . 
  i thought it said homophobia which made it even more remarkable . 
   groenlinks ( gl ) wanted a hard minimum on the number of refugees that the netherlands would have to take in on an yearly basis . 
  did they ? 
  i ca n't find it anywhere . 
  i do n't know enough about mobile networks to answer your question , but tele2 actually operates its own 4g network . 
  they only depend on t-mobile for 3g coverage . 
  there 's a [ faq ] ( https://www.tele2.nl/shop/mobiel/abonnement/sim-only/?data=onbeperkt&amp;voice=onbeperkt&amp;binding=24#faq ) section . 
  or below sea level here . 
  [ tele2 ] ( https://www.tele2.nl/shop/mobiel/abonnement/sim-only/?data=onbeperkt&amp;voice=onbeperkt&amp;binding=24 ) now offers unlimited data for $ 25 a month . 
  join the dark side , join the eu !, 
  [ and extremist jews stealing land from muslims . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israeli_settlement ), 
  only 42.4 % though , it 's their broken system that got them 318 seats . 
  in fact , the government she 's forming only has 43.3 % support . 
  labour , snp and libdem got 50.4 % of the votes . 
  the last government that ruled by absolute majority had only 36.9 % support , hardly a democracy . 
  especially since the republic stretches further north than northern ireland . 
  it only makes sense to keep the extra anti-terror powers , there are no indications islamic extremism is declining . 
  we need to be vigilant . 
  no indyref but perhaps staying in the eu will be a condition for coalition talks for the snp . 
  yeah , i noticed it must have been in the netherlands , just was n't sure exactly where .
