  then i actually drove past it not that long ago on my way to eindhoven . 
  the road between tilburg and waalwijk also struck me as a very wooded area . 
  i 'm familiar with the concept , it 's just that this one comes out particularly well in this photograph !, 
  we do n't have much nature where i live so it 's actually quite surprising to me we have this in the netherlands , most ecoducts i know are pretty barren . 
  wow , that looks awesome , where is this ? 
   this is not mapporn or beautiful imo . 
  to me it 's both . 
  true , but there 's plenty of flat cities that do n't have proper cycling infrastructure around the world . 
  wallonia is not only less densely populated , it 's also not flat . 
  which is why they were n't part of the quota system . 
  perhaps we could hook up little george with [ princess amalia ] ( https://static.eo.nl/fileadmin/bestanden-2016/_processed_/csm_prinses-amalia_01_9c7f356a06.jpg ) . 
  you 're more likely to get our king again . 
  such a tragic event , not only losing your father , but also having him found in an ice cold river . 
  we can only hope his moment of horror did n't last long . 
  building a fence is a good step , but does very little to stop migrants going for italy . 
  perhaps eastern european countries should stick up for each other . 
  so why do n't the countries that agree make proposals to implement it ? 
  i agree when it comes to morocco , algeria , tunisia and egypt , but not only does libya not have a truly legitimate government , their territory is being abused to send an invasion , consider it self-defence . 
  to some of them life is precious , as long as it 's white and unborn . 
  now i 'm not saying i think we should sustain all human life on earth , but at least i 'm not pretending to be a follower of jesus . 
  if only they made such proposals , all they do is ` we do n't want them , deal with it yourself ' . 
  how many belarusians and ukrainians will drown if you do n't let them in ? 
   funny what do you do if they do n't let you bring the boats back ? 
  you use your economical and military power . 
  on verra < 3, 
  trump is still looking for a broker selling iq , he did n't think it 'd be this tough to find one . 
  who cares , france alone is enough to scare you off . 
  i was told it 's hidden amidst all kinds of no-go zones , that would explain the great lack of appreciation .

  there are quite some nice towns i did n't cover , including [ delft ] ( http://www.luchtreiziger.nl/images/stories/delft.jpg ) . 
  [ this is what they did in zaandam . 
  [ there you go .

  well , it would n't surprise me if you could . 
  just bring a pair of binoculars with you . 
  it 's all within a two hour drive from amsterdam airport though , 
  what did the mirror say ? 
  uror amore mei , flammas moveoque feroque . 
  nunc duo concordes anima moriemur in una . 
  you stole our gold and sold it to switzerland though . 
   with international agreement . 
  no new treaty ever came to effect , although colloquially such name was given . 
  it was most definitely a treaty , just one that amended another treaty , but still a treaty . 
  i stood in front of that one as well , 
  tours ?

  seeing this picture here , i guess icelandic people simply enjoy cosiness . 
  and much cheaper as well .

  i still have some dutch 1 and 2cts at home , they 're just catching dust here . 
  eu schools , best schools . 
  wait , so i could just cut a $ 50 bill in half , and pretend both sides represent 51 % ( who 's going to measure it anyway ) and spend $ 100 ? 
  temperatures reached up to 33 degrees celsius on saturday . 
  apart from wanting to cling to czech republic , what 's wrong with czechia ? 
  this question is better suited for / r/askeurope or / r/travel . 
  it would also be helpful to tell a little bit more about your interests and intentions , as this is a very broad question . 
   the trade between the two countries was nil because of the sanctions , that is circular reasoning . 
  it 's mostly geographical distance and the fact that the us does n't import/export much in general for its size . 
  look at the us 's trade with russia pre-2014 , completely negligible compared to eu-russia trade . 
  she did n't say it would be next week . 
  ladies first ? 
   throw their mother 's tongue away lol, 
   simply mirroring the cost 1:1 is discriminatory , any other amount works . 
  which it totally arbitrary in itself . 
  if germany would lower it by 135 instead of 130 it 's okay , that 's what you 're saying . 
  apparently , it 's only okay if it 's not directly linked which in the end makes little sense if the effect is the exact same : germans paying less taxes because foreigners start to pay more . 
  what you 're effectively saying is that germany can only alter its system if it returns the extra money it makes to foreigners or uses it to permanently increase its road budget , both of which are ridiculous demands that no other country has to abide by . 
  it 's so blatant , yet they do n't even see it ... 
  that does n't mean they ca n't have lower taxes on other terrains or spend more than they could otherwise . 
  fact is they earn more because they charge foreigners and it allows them to alter their national budget . 
  every country that requires foreign drivers to pay tolls , is targeting foreigners and thus germans . 
   how is that even possible ? 
  because it seems he 's not putting any effort in making mental notes . 
  he 's busy making sure he stands in front of other leaders on pictures rather than keeping track of who those leaders actually are . 
  sure they did , but as a response to other countries targeting germans . 
  that 's why it 's hypocritical to call them out on it . 
  i guess most car owners pay income taxes and vat . 
  i 'm not a fan of toll either , because it obstructs free movement and therefore tourism . 
  however , it 's silly and hypocritical to act as if germany is targeting foreigners since that 's inherent to changing from a system in which only germans pay to a system in which * all * road users pay while not changing road expenditures . 
  the swedish wiki has millions of articles created by bots about exotic insects no one will ever be interested in : [ example ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/micromyzella_anisopappi ) . 
  perhaps germany should not lower vehicle taxes , but just lower some other obscure tax with the same effect and no one will bat an eye ... 
  how is what germany 's doing any different from what austria , czechia , switzerland and other toll-levying countries are doing ? 
  all of them are charging foreigners for using their roads and use the money to lower taxes for their own people or spend more within their own respective countries . 
  the only difference is that they have been doing it from scratch whereas germany is only implementing it now .

  [ is erdogan reaping what he sowed ? 
  i 'm not buying into this , sorry . 
  at one point people start seeing things to confirm their own biases . 
  let 's be honest , everyone knows that no non-nato power will ever invade just the netherlands and even if they do there is no way germany , france and the uk will accept this alien power building a stronghold in the center of europe alongside their borders , with or without nato .
