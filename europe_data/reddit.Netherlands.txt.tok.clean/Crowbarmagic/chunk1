i see you got an a in `` hollywood 101 '' . 
  we are anything but rich , but my brother went to a private school ( like only 6 students per class ) for 2 years because he has add and some other stuff . 
  but yea , it 's pretty rare . 
  main reason i knew about the ottoman empire was because of the ww1 chapter in havo 4 . 
  history as a school subject is for a big part often localised and somewhat patriotic . 
  ` if it did n't happen here or affected us ( much ) , it 's not worth bothering with ' seems to be the general mindset . 
  from your flair i take it you 're swiss . 
  how much did school teach you about something like the danish empire ? 
   because we sieged vienna this almost seems funny because the only europeans that even know about this would be history buffs or maybe austrians . 
  i doubt an average frenchman or englishman would know . 
  edit : i definitely underestimated how well known it is . 
  history is one of those localised school subjects and in most countries somewhat patriotic , so when some event is n't that important to that country or its people , it 's often not taught about . 
  not that the siege of vienna is n't important or anything though . 
  if the ottomans succeeded history might have had a very different turn . 
  it 's just that because it did n't succeed it did n't influence most west european countries . 
  if you have time and do n't mind to do the effort , i 'm curious what results you could come up with . 
  i do n't speak japanese so if i do with the help of a website like [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.nl/ ) it often does n't make any sense . 
  i 'm not sure what exact keywords op used , but i imagine he either typed the name of the country or its people . 
  `` germany is/has '' or `` germans are '' for example . 
  maybe like how a lot of people know about dijon mustard , but do n't know dijon is a city or have no idea where it is . 
  i know someone that thought it was just a brand name . 
  no one deserves to be tortured by having to listen to yodeling . 
  i also like the 4th place suggestion :  rrs it 's bloody cold here, 
  what is australia doing there ? 
  i think it started with news outlets trying to appear cool and up to date with the youth , but misunderstood what it actually was . 
  it 's one of the first things that i saw on the frontpage a few hourse ago . 
  but i guess since the plane landed , the released hostages , and hearing his demands it seems he 's not a terrorist but just stupid , so it makes the story less interesting for foreign media whose citizens are n't involved ( that is , until someone gets killed ) . 
  so next to the `` it 's not ok to assault women '' course , we need to add an `` it 's not ok to hijack airplanes '' course ? 
  when it 's behind a few walls probably . 
  that means `` good game '' . 
  i mean , they * are * psv . . 
  surely a reinforced brick house would fare a bit better ( so not the brick facade you see with a lot of newer houses ) ? 
  if the tornado goes directly over your house , yea sure you are probably fucked either way , but if it just comes close , i would think it 's better protection against flying debris ( not to mention it 's harder to topple something if it weighs 10 times as much ) . 
  it 's probably not cost efficient though . 
  i 've only been to croatia twice , but from what i understand once in a while they have these strong alpine mountain winds ( bora ? ) . 
  overall the weather is beautiful though . 
  fun anecdote : the day before we arrived at our campsite there was a big storm , so when we pulled up on the parking lot there was this mountain of broken tents . 
  could n't agree more . 
  adding a bit to the whole `` not being allowed to insult a person in a particulair post '' thing : people can take critique of their work as insulting ( if someone calls it a bad idea etc. ) . 
  politicians can take insult when the opposition or the media does n't like certain ideas . 
  therefore , a law that forbids the public for insulting the president seems inherently undemocratic . 
  it might be unlikely that it goes that far , but if it lawfully * could * go that far there 's something wrong . 
  same with a law that says you ca n't insult the royal family here . 
  i was very surprised to find out such a law existed since the royal family gets roasted by the media all the time . 
  often light hearted , but some jokes are pretty mean spirited , and i 've never heard of anyone getting in trouble for it . 
  anyway , laws like that should be abolished altogether , even though they are not enforced at the moment . 
  when some dickhead suddenly decides they do want to enforce it it 's too late . 
  100 % increase of 0 is 0 . 
  what he said is true though . 
  if you come from syria , iraq , somalia , afghanistan or eritrea you have a very very good chance of being accepted , so i wonder what their motive is for going underground ( if they are actually somalis as they claim . 
  they could very well say that just to not alarm anyone ) . 
  `` i 'm very sorry mr. christ . 
  i did n't make the rules . '', 
  examples ? 
  maybe they 'll barb wire it . 
  anyway , it 's going to be a lot harder than it is now and gives the police/security more time to respond . 
  for those that did n't read the article , they plan it on being 4 meter high . 
  source ? 
  i always understood you have to get out as soon as possible . 
  i watched some stuff on cold enviroment training and part of it was ` falling ' in ice cold water and climbing out . 
  i think that 's what they were practicing . 
  some guy i knew went to norway as part of his training and he had to do it too . 
  it kinda depends on the context . 
  on the world stage i indentify as european . 
  but i do get a very differnt vibe from the uk though , judging by british media . 
  i get the impression that `` european '' seems to be a synonim for `` foreigner '' in the uk which was kinda funny to me when i noticed . 
  yea but does n't that law includes holding hands in public and stuff like that ? 
  still oppressive in my opinion . 
  back when this law was n't passed yet some people on the russian subreddit discussed about it like it was a law against public gay sex ( i 'm not kidding ) . 
  even though there are already laws against those things , straight or gay . 
  sounds like he hired the wrong lawyer , first for not arguing is not constitutional and secondly : even if he wanted argue gollum as being not negative , at least bring some clips of him rescuing from frodo ? 
  then he could argue his client sees gollum as a tragic character that can redeem himself ( and maybe claim he only saw lotr 1 & 2 so he never saw gollum turn bad ) . 
   kako said he had experienced similar incidents before . 
  `` once there was a player who stood and peed next to the pitch . 
  i showed him a yellow card , too . '' that does n't seem very similair to me . . 
  they look like like printed popup ads . 
   2 million migrants who he can send to europe tomorrow if he feels like it , and that number is rapidly growing . 
  i know it 's very simply put , but what if a border country just says no and does n't let anyone in ? 
  ( i understand stuff is more complicated than that , but i 'm wondering about your opinion since you know more than me ) . 
  like i said , it was a shitty drawing and i do n't know enough about wordart to get the shape i wanted . 
  about the context , in a lot of those cartoons its true , but that goes for most political cartoons . 
  a lot of them are n't exactly timeless because they are about current events . 
  the greek with the middle finger for example makes sense , within context . 
  i ca n't draw which is why i 'm not a catoonist . 
  i do think i might have a better imagination the cartoonist though . 
   the greek individual in the op makes up a tiny portion of the final image . 
  he could 've drawn the greek guy a bit bigger ? 
  the swedish flag is small too . 
  him holding a greek flag like the swede is still better than labels . 
   except it 's not coming from the side of the ship . 
  it 's instead coming from some nefarious looking person , presumably to represent foul play . 
  i actually did n't noticed this on the first look , but i think ` debt ' as anchor could still work . 
  like said before , i ca n't draw , but i made a shitty example using wordart and paint http://imgur.com/g9gi9z1 . 
  yes it 's still spelled out but do n't you agree it 's a more creative solution than a label ? 
   broken clothes and carry-able items does n't convey they are immigrants/refugees . 
  out of context , maybe not , but within the context of the biggest refugee crisis since ww2 ? 
  i definitely think so . 
  and remember that you sometimes do n't even have to draw them as refugees to make clear that they are . 
  some other examples of refugees without label : [ 1 ] ( https://simonkneebone.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/17499-3ysvn.jpg?w=510&amp;h=327 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.truthdig.com/images/made/images/cartoonuploads/sw0909cd_590_356.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/i150916c-714x477.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( https://simonkneebone.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/17499-3ysvn.jpg?w=510&amp;h=327 ) , [ 5 ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/-lampedusa-immigrants-refugee-asylum_seekers-migrant-pwen397_low.jpg ) , [ 6 ] ( http://www.cartoonmovement.com/depot/cartoons/2015/08/29/refugees_in_germany__marian_kamensky.jpeg ) , [ 7 ] ( http://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/main_image_article_page/public/main-images/tragedy%20of%20immigration%20to%20europe%20middle%20east%20eye.gif ) . 
   how would you know it 's an anchor ?
