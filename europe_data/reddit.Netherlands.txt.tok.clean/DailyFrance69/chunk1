what the hell ? 
  60gb is an _ insane _ amount of data for a mobile device . 
  like , you 'd have to be streaming 1080p movies everytime you do n't have wifi to reach that . 
  many people are `` artificially limiting '' their use of mobile data in the sense that they do n't freaking use it unneccesarily . 
  60gb is a _ gigantic _ amount of data for the average person . 
  the _ vast _ majority of people would never , ever , reach 60gb a month . 
  i mean , it 's nice if 60gb would be available for cheap , but it 's _ completely ridiculous _ to complain about 60gb not `` being available at a reasonable price '' . 
  i mean , i can understand that the average redditor uses more internet than most people , but you have to realize that 60gb is an unfathomable amount of mobile data for most people . 
  i 'd be very happy that people painted half my house for free ( with reasonable expectation of them painting even more for me later ) , and gladly paint the rest myself . 
  this is completely ridiculous . 
  what the eu did is good for the consumer . 
  that is an objective fact . 
  just because it 's not _ as good _ as it can be ( even though there 's an exception for a small amount of data ) people have `` no faith '' ? 
  it 's utter bollocks . 
  this kind of thing happens with _ literally every government in existence _ . 
  but because it 's the eu , if it 's not perfect , people `` lose faith '' . 
  hell , i 'd say that , compared to most national governments , the eu _ barely _ `` slacks off '' . 
  for the common european , eu legislation is often _ miles _ better than the things most national governments do . 
  i do n't know if i should explain how this is pretty much a literal translation of the term , which means that dutch is close to english , or invite comments about crazy consonant combinations . 
  most polling stations have more ballots than they will use . 
  for example , some places in amsterdam have enough ballots to cover a 110 % turnout . 
  i expect they got it from a polling place , that probably invalidated the ballot to begin with by drawing something on the back or something . 
  and it 's paranoid too now , so that assessment stays very accurate . 
  i mean , being anti-eu is kind of fundamentally pessimistic . 
  do n't get me wrong , there 's a lot wrong and things to improve about the eu . 
  but being completely against it means essentially that you think different people will never band together but that we 'll always be stuck in different nations . 
  sounds pessimistic to me . 
  well , following mainstream media ( several of them ) is still the best way to get your information . 
  watching bbc , al-jazeera , local news outlets , several news papers , and of course news aggregators on the internet . 
  the people who are misinformed are the people that blanket all `` mainstream media '' as untrustworthy and then go to realnews.ru to find their information . 
  do mainstream media have a bias ? 
  of course , every media platform has bias . 
  that 's why you follow several of them . 
  railing against `` the mainstream media '' is utterly idiotic and often a sign of someone who is only looking for news in their own confirmation bias-created bubble . 
  can everyone please stop using `` the elites '' as some kind of party that controls negotiations ? 
  the eu was created by various elected people who represent people from all over europe . 
  they had plenty of disagreements . 
  there is no `` elite '' . 
  there are _ a lot _ of national representatives that disagree with each other pretty much always . 
  seriously . 
  `` the elites '' are not an entity . 
  they 're powerful people . 
  that means they 're people , and fight amongst themselves just like everyone . 
  they 're elected by local voters . 
  they have their own interests . 
  stuff happens because there 's popular movement towards that direction . 
  `` the elites '' do n't exist , just as `` the people '' do n't exist . 
  it 's movement directed by massive forces of human opinions , not some `` elite '' cabal that coordinates things . 
  fyi , `` cultural marxism '' is a bonafide nazi propaganda term ( cultural bolshevism ) . 
  it does not exist , it 's a concept made up purely to sow hatred against jews and leftists . 
  not reducing = / = further opening, 
  so you admit that you were lying when you said they wanted to further open borders ? 
  since it does not say that anywhere , nor imply it . 
  by the way , saying that the focus should be on providing aid to people instead of getting less refugees also does n't mean they 'd oppose any measures to secure the eu border , so you were lying in the interpretation of their words too . 
  well theyre either trolling or really , really stupid . 
  the hyperventilating about `` le literal 1984 '' reddit does everytime a thing like this comes up is just silly . 
  no , there wo n't be a ministry of truth . 
  no , you will still be able to voice your opinion . 
  no , things wo n't get `` censored '' because the government does n't agree with it . 
  yes , articles stating blatant falsehoods as `` news '' instead of opinions will be attacked , and _ that 's a good thing _ . 
  that does confirm my main point though , right ? 
  hillary lost a small amounts of votes , which is understandable since she 's following obama , one of the greatest orators of this generation , and trump gained more than twice that amount . 
  hence hillary did n't do `` terrible '' and trump did pretty decent . 
   the feels drove the acceptance of public that the only way those poor souls can be helped is by allowing everyone in . 
  false . 
  first of all , literally no-one is for `` allowing everyone in '' . 
  name a single elected official in the entirety of europe who is for completely unrestricted access of immigrants to europe . 
  you ca n't . 
  the `` allowing everyone in '' thing is a complete strawman constructed by extreme right-wingers . 
  second , literally no-one is saying that allowing them in is the only way to help those poor souls . 
  everyone is emphasizing that neighbouring countries should help as much as they can , and that local help is preferable . 
  but as you might know , there are _ millions _ of refugees , and neighbouring countries are already overwhelmed by massive need for help . 
  in the end allowing a portion of those refugees into europe to help them here is very prudent . 
   hillary just did extremely bad . 
  hillary actually did pretty decent . 
  she got something like 70.000 less votes than obama got when he was running in 2012 , and obama has been a historically popular democratic candidate . 
  like , a once-in-a-life-time type of politician . 
  the problem was that her voters were n't in the right locations . 
  trump actually did pretty well , since he got 2 million more votes than romney in 2012 , and romney was considered a very decent republican candidate . 
  people have to acknowledge the inconvenient truth that trump did n't get elected because of one single reason , and that he definitely did n't get elected because `` hurr hillary bad '' . 
  there 's just a lot of americans , as baffling as that may seem , who _ like _ trump . 
  not at all . 
  i just showed with your own logic that clearly all europeans should be deported and replaced by peaceful people . 
  alternatively , since the vast majority of crime and terrorism is perpetrated by men , it is clear we should deport all men and replace them with female refugees . 
  why would being born in x random place except you from such treatment ? 
  if among white europeans there is one mass murderer ( breivik ) , than clearly ~ 510 million is too many . 
  they can literally say their `` economic recession '' predictions are not lies because the uk _ did n't actually leave _ . 
  it 's an objective fact that you ca n't call it a lie . 
  it 's simply impossible , because \u00eft ca n't be determined whether or not leaving the eu will trigger recession _ when the uk has n't actually left yet _ . 
   fortunately the public believed vote leave who correctly said that article 50 would not be triggered immediately . 
  so they correctly believed the vote leave campaign in that voting leaving would n't actually mean leaving ? 
  sounds like the only party lieing here is the one advocating that voting `` leave '' is n't actually `` leaving '' . 
   if it 's ok for the guy you like to censor the news you do n't like it 's not `` censoring news you do n't like '' . 
  it 's cutting down on blatant neo-nazi propaganda , which is always a good idea . 
   it is n't europe 's responsibility to solve middle eastern religious wars . 
  after decades of meddling in the middle-east , pretty much directly creating the situation we 're in now ? 
  it 's very much europe 's responsibility . 
  the us ' too , but europe can not refuse responsibility for a mess that they had a hand in creating . 
   false dilemmas the irony of accusing your opponent of positing `` false dilemmas '' and `` absolutes '' _ directly _ after you created the fiction that the poster you replied to ( or anyone for that matter ) is advocating `` free flow of immigrants '' . 
  there is pretty much _ no-one _ advocating `` free flow '' of immigrants .
