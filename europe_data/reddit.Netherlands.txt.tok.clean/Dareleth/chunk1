as far as i 'm concerned , germany is very much like home . 
  the northern part at least . 
  quite enjoy going there and it feels pretty much the same . 
  leaving the hre was probably a bad move , would 've been far more efficient to have this entire rhine trade system within one nation . 
  and who knows , maybe we here up north would n't be speaking this disgusting hollandic franconian dialect now . 
  as for belgium ... flanders is fine , have about the same opinion of them as i do of the southern netherlands . 
  do n't really care about wallonia at all . 
  i dunno , i imagine germany winning ww1 would n't have been that bad . 
  woulda saved us the second one at least , as france would 've been nowhere near powerful enough to try to take revenge . 
   but the turks were massacring the bulgarians and greeks for decades and centuries before the balkan wars . 
  not even remotely comparable to the armenian situation . 
  the ottomans never took the whole `` caliph '' thing particularly seriously though . 
  they just picked up the title from the previous owners when they conquered 'em . 
  why does the eu give money to parties which intend to undermine it ? 
  never lucky, 
  no , because most people literally do n't know anything about history before 1939 or so . 
  i agree . 
  europe is our home and we should defend it . 
  therefore , i suggest we expel the english menace as soon as possible . 
  nothing will change anyway . 
  the question is basically , `` how much do you want the negative effects of capitalism to be softened as the elites go on controlling anything regardless ? '', 
  the southern pseudo-belgians do . 
   germans were forced to send an entire land-air-sea force to greece and it pushed back invasion of russia to july . 
  heavy spring rains were already doing that . 
  the balkan adventure was just an added reason not do it . 
  but hey , do n't let history get in the way of nationalist dick waving . 
  they could n't have invaded much earlier because of the heavy rain which made the terrain a disaster to invade . 
  the balkan adventure was n't the primary reason , just a diversion which added to already pressing reasons to wait a few months . 
  try wages of destruction for an overview of how absurdly hard the deck was stacked against the axis . 
   the margin was smaller than most people realize . 
  no , every fucking amateur `` historian '' on the internet says this bullshit . 
  what people need to realize is that it was a fucking miracle that germany got as far as they did . 
  fuck , ww2 and france in general are the two subjects on this site that make me want to never read comments again . 
  so much ignorant nonsense . 
  `` i , as a supporter of the person who ruined all of greece 's hopes of ever regaining their ethnic lands on the east coast and then deported them all , love greeks . '', 
  do you really believe that ? 
  it 's hardly obscure knowledge and never has been . 
  the elites just do n't care because the oil is more important than any of this crap . 
  i guess civ is trying to cure the peripheral areas of their stockholm syndrome . 
  if you clowns could brexit yourselves from this subreddit also , that would be great . 
  italians are a joke . 
  hitler did nothing wrong remains the classic . 
   i think if you take into ** account ** everyday ** conversation ** ** germanic ** would be much higher that 26 ** % ** . 
  lots of the ** romance ** ** vocabulary ** is ** technical ** or ** legal ** ** terms ** which are n't in everyday use . 
  they ** analysed ** ** different ** ** types ** of speech for the ** ratio ** of ** different ** word ** origins ** and found that the more ** emotive ** speech was the higher the ** ratio ** of ** germanic ** ** origin ** . 
  the more ** technical ** or ** academic ** the speech the higher the ** origin ** of ** romance ** ** vocabulary ** . 
  i dunno , looks like ** plenty ** of ** romance ** words in ** just ** some random r ** eddit ** ** comment ** . 
  who cares ? 
  this is a minor injustice in the world . 
  there 's rich people out there with far more power and influence for you to worry about . 
  the referendum had little to nothing to do with ukraine , it was just as internal political move which ukraine got screwed by . 
   just imagine , if just a few yes-voters would n't have showed up , then they would have gained what they wanted . 
  a lot of yes-voters strategically stayed home for precisely this reason . 
  because the eu is a competing power . 
   keep in mind eurovision was made to unite a broken continent , that purpose has been fulfilled so why not open it up ? 
  how has it been fulfilled ? 
  no one wants to work together , people hate immigrants from other european nations , attempts at any real unity fail , there 's active wars between european nations going on ... what use is soft power if europe is just a bunch of bickering states united only by franco-german economic dominance and common servitude to the usa ? 
  yeah , because most colonies look back on their former overlords so positively ... 
  the eu is n't rising any time soon . 
  if i were them , i 'd be more concerned with trying to create a sense of unity among the member states , as recent events have shown it to be clearly lacking . 
   russian nationalism ? 
  are you joking ? 
  stalin was n't even russian . 
  no , but he definitely made use of it . 
  he deported random minorities like tartars and replaced them with russians and engaged in russification policies . 
  this is the guy who changed the anthem from `` the internationale '' to a song beginning with the line : `` an unbreakable union of free republics / the great russia has welded forever to stand . '', 
  stalin was n't an idiot ; georgians and other minorities meant nothing to the ussr , russians meant everything . 
  using russian history and nationalism to fuel their support for the state was a sensible move . 
  long ago = ~ 25 years . 
  socialism failed and the left has nothing to really take its place other than being salty and raging against victorious and uncontested capitalism . 
  they are n't in favor of the free market , but they 're definitely in favor of a class system and people and companies owning the means of production , albeit in service of the state . 
  which really is n't socialist at all , just kinda social-democrat if anything . 
  and the fetishizing of violence and masculinity . 
  except the ussr did so by design while russia is just a failed economy which ca n't crawl out of the pit it dug itself . 
  and then rumania got fucking dumpstered . 
  and for no good reason , really , considering they would probably have gotten transylvania for free after the war just out of the entente 's desire to punish austria and hungary . 
  i call it czechia , but that 's just because the dutch name is tsjechi\u00eb and the english equivalent just looks really long and unwieldy to me . 
  i 'm surprised greece jokes more about albania than fyromia or turkey . 
  i do n't care . 
  you 're just some random nation now whose only connection to us is our shared servitude to america . 
  what happens to you is your business . 
  it 's all fictitious . 
  seriously suggesting that there is a direct connection between modern greece and the ancient city states to the point where ancient individuals can be attributed to modern greece is lunacy . 
  both , depending on the context . 
  austrian did n't mean jack shit back then . 
  the first thing they did upon the collapse of the habsburg empire is attempt to join germany . 
  it 's only after ww2 that we came up with this joke of austrian being a separate nationality despite said state spending like 90 % of its existence as the leading state of the various forms of germany . 
  stalin is not at all equivalent . 
  georgians were regarded as a separate people with a separate language and culture . 
  austrians were just germans arbitrarily excluded from germany by either habsburg obligations or versailles diktat . 
  modern greece claiming to be equivalent to ancient greece is just as laughable . 
  they spend like a 1500 + year intermezzo referring to themselves as romaioi and only relatively recently decided that they should name themselves after that other ancient civilization again . 
  these characters really should n't be chosen from history that ancient . 
  paul the apostle influenced more of global civilization than jesus did ... 
  yuck , do n't even suggest that . 
  this map triggers me so fucking hard . 
  immanuel kant for fucking russia ? 
  attila the hun for hungary ? 
  are they fucking serious ? 
  but you did n't even exist in the 18th century .
