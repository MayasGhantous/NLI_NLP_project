well to be fair it 's the ideology they believe in which causes them to do such radical actions . 
  the way i see it , is that the actions of these terrorists are driven by a mixed ideology of islam and revenge , while the atrocities commited by the soviet union were based on fright of losing control . 
  i think he means he has never been to the far reaches of the country far from moscow . 
  worse than that , the website is spammed by american fake news articles . 
  ( for example rutte apologizing to turkey, 
  no it also depends on factors from outside . 
  is someone is pressured/stressed for example his brain will act different than when he is relaxed . 
  thus increasing the chance on less t-hormone thus making the person less sexual oriented . 
  ~ ~ we are going full american boys ! ~ ~ a war would n't happen . 
  there are too many non-sheep turks who will not support his decisions . 
  i am sure generals in the turkish army would never allow a war with the eu . 
  uh mayble you need a chill ? 
  we always got teached it was because they needed money and the jews had most money at that time . 
  they hated gipsies , homosexuals , slavs etc. 
  because they were not \u00fcbermenschen . 
  sweden-denmaek feud looks more lime the belgium-netherlands one, 
  is jezus a hipster, 
  well i have quite a few heterosexual friends who also go there , since it 's a big party and a nice excuse to get drunk with friends . 
  dont call me mate , friend !, 
  and belgium !, 
  could i have a source on that `` far right are literally killing people even in the netherlands '' ? 
  now do the shitpost subreddits . 
  mayble we should let it happen and then reclaim it , no one will denounce us that way \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  it would help them win a war . 
  if the turkish army beats them and starts invading russian territory than this could be easily a kill switch to eliminate turkey . 
  and in my opinion russia ( and the us ) love showing their cocks if we are speaking about military . 
  sadly russia has enough nukes to turn turkey into one radiated desert . 
  wat is een sos ? 
  1688 , vk is van nederland, 
  cereal, 
  you need a timeout . 
  landverader !, 
  prism tanks are op man :(, 
  [ newsflash we already have a hockey and is one of the most played sports in the netherlands . 
  ] ( https://nl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hockey#/languages ), 
  [ a-n-n-e-x-e-r-e-n ] ( https://i.redd.it/bf4y5wl623ay.png ), 
  everyone on the internet is exaggerating . 
  [ this video is a bit more recent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noql-azq1xq ), 
  no it was about where to put the refugees . 
  huh you are right . 
  i might have looked before the thread was populair . 
  i remember upvoting downvoted vvd comments . 
  thanks i will edit my original post . 
  well last time when people were asking : would you vote different than before if we have second elections . 
  some guy said he was quite sad about the state of gl and wanted to vote d66 or vvd . 
  people were booing at him and placing sad smiley faces with `` why would you do that ? '' . 
  a few peope who wanted to vote fvd , pvv or vvd were downvoted . 
  ( i said i wanted to vote for vvd again and i got downvoted ) . 
  so yes that sub deffinitly is at the left side . 
  edit : i think i looked at that thread in its early stages , which i saw people from right parties downvoted . 
  what is happening ?? 
  thanks germany, 
  you are either swamp german or fries french . 
  that was sort of the joke , but i guess it was kinda shit . 
  now you trigger me . 
  we speak an incredible great language based of english and germanic . 
  give us our cycles back :(, 
  we should send our sea beggars , i am sure that would work well . 
  well mostly they sell fake drugs on the streets ( stamped vitamin c as cocaine ) to stoned people . 
  or they try a few tricks to pickpocket you . 
  i recommend never buying drugs from the street , over 90 % is fake . 
  may i come too ? 
  i will bring spices . 
  then americans wo n't confuse us with eachother anymore :o we build polders and no more confusion . 
  win win . 
  i wonder if greeks will also develop the art of `` scam the stoned '', 
  we won finland . 
  this comment section fills my daily dose of drama . 
  thanks . 
  hispanjolen :(, 
  mayble that s why you are more innovative :(, 
  take that finland . 
  a lot of parties want a stricter immigration policy ( including the 4 biggest parties ) . 
  so i supose that will come . 
  imb4 random dutch guy complaining you wrote holland and not netherlands . 
  you truly want to live in a county with these people ? 
   13de provincie in opstand stronk , 13de provinvie in opstand relevant !, 
  i `` fixed '' it for you ( \u25d5 \u1d17 \u25d5 \u273f ), 
  a lot of people i know ( yes i know not a creditable source ) see thr czech republic as poor ( same with poland ) . 
  they do n't want them too . 
  i really wish we could send them away , but everywhere they will go they make the situation worse . 
  ~ ~ ( mayble not in space ) ~ ~ i thought i read somewhere that this was also one of the reasons why some people in britain want to bring back the death penalty . 
  and in return control in europe . 
  but what about the waste ? 
  let us `` fix '' your infrastructure ( \u25d5 \u25e1 \u25d5 \u273f ), 
  there are eu elections ? 
  i think because his capital is now the glorious great leader 's capital . 
  okay this is getting kinda cringy ... 
  ~ ~ nah let 's just call it luxembourg ~ ~, 
  but are you safe saying these things on an open platform like reddit ? 
  ca n't the state prosecute you for saying these things ? 
  but why should we justify . 
  most citizens of the netherlands want to keep the king . 
  why should a random foreign person tell us to not like our king ? 
  how does it feel being american and still not able to use english grammar properly ? 
  5/8 of the r/le _ pen mods post a lot on r/t _ d and what they write on other subredits are in american english . 
  8/10 the wilders mods speak american english . 
  looks like those subreddits are n't made by the original countrymen haha . 
  i am looking forward to it , 
  i did n't know all cultures in the eu were based of german culture .
