  william of orange defeated philip ii in single combat on the first day of the revolt . 
  the next 80 years were spent celebrating and laughing at the belgians . 
   ** former ** spanish colony we sure as hell did n't get no freedom by surrendering bro . 
  that 's what the belgians did . 
  * muh 80 years war !, 
  i understand that , but we ca n't negotiate different terms for 49 % of the country . 
  as it stands now , britain is 100 % going to leave . 
  the time for compromise on that subject is over . 
  we have to consider the british government as being 100 % leave , even if the public is n't . 
  the fact that 49 % voted to remain also means i want a fair deal with britain . 
  however , we ca n't afford to offer britain a deal that is on the same level as what they have now . 
  a non-eu member getting a better deal than any actual eu member would be the death of the union . 
  and if the eu dies , only a select few countries will get a favourable deal . 
  i understand that and if it were up to me something as drastic as leaving the eu should n't have been decided by a mere majority . 
  it should have been a supermajority . 
  however , in the end britain is still leaving and we have to prepare ourselves for this divorce . 
  when i say i 'll oppose any favourable deal , that means i want britain to get a fair deal . 
  however that deal needs to be fair to both the eu and britain , not just britain . 
  not getting a favourable deal is n't a punishment . 
  it 's the norm , which britain has avoided for the past few decades . 
  i truly wish britain the best , even though i disagree with its course , but i 'll be damned if britain gets a deal with all the benefits of the eu without the drawbacks . 
   complete childish emotion  downvote all you want , it does n't change how stupid you are i rest my case . 
  i rarely see remainers ridiculed . 
  whenever someone makes a mean comment about the british it 's very clearly directed at those who voted leave . 
  in fact , being pro-eu with a british flag will probably get you upvoted pretty often . 
  as i said , i feel sorry for remainers who have to live with the consequences of brexit . 
  i 'd wish you could have stayed . 
  but i wo n't stop criticising those who voted leave , nor will i approve of a favourable deal for britain . 
  i 'd rather have seen a britain that cares about the entire union instead of just looking out for themselves . 
  the sour part is that 48 % of brits did care for the eu and they have to leave as well . 
   inb4 `` eu does no wrong , criticism is treason '' you know that 's a straw man as well as i do , so i 'm not going to comment on it . 
  criticising the french is no fun at all . 
  they surrender before you can even complete your sentence . 
  as far as i know , the netherlands did fight back initially , but it was just impossible to hold against the germans . 
  we held up the germans at the afsluitdijk , but after they completely bombed rotterdam we understood it was no use . 
  maybe we could have held out another week , but then the hague and amsterdam would also have been destroyed . 
  you ca n't berate the polish for stealing your cars while you still have n't returned our bikes !, 
  i mean , how can you not ? 
  every nationality gets criticised on this sub . 
  during the greek debt crisis it was the greeks . 
  during the refugee crisis it was the germans . 
  now during brexit ( or at least its prelude ) it 's the british . 
  it 's not even the british in general , just those who voted to leave . 
   what happened to the spirit of europe ? 
  why are we letting lousy politicians and their political errors divide us , the peoples of europe ? 
  brexit was ** not ** a political error . 
  it was a conscious decision by the british public . 
  during the run up to the referendum there was plenty of shit thrown in the eu 's direction , so it 's hardly strange that some of it gets returned now that you actually want to leave . 
  for years the eu has given britain exceptions that normal members would n't get . 
  britain had the best deal in the entire union and still it was n't enough . 
  many people are just fed up with britain and how it treats its so-called friends . 
  i feel sorry for those who wanted to remain and i hope the consequences wo n't be too dire . 
  i ca n't bring myself to empathise with those who voted to leave though . 
  once again polish immigrants take over the jobs of hardworking british people !, 
  malta also has english as an official language , so maybe they just assume any maltese would speak in english . 
  not kim kardashian , because she was robbed in her residence . 
  it 's also jewellery worth 6 million euro , so it was n't like they had bags of money lying around . 
  of course , this can all be read in the article . 
  there 's not enough hand gestures for that . 
  that 's probably because you 're dutch and thus can easily pick out the mistakes . 
  someone who does n't speak dutch wo n't notice a lot of the common mistakes . 
  they 'll notice an obvious accent , but everyone has one . 
  there 's plenty of english , irish , scottish and american accents that are harder to understand than the dutch accent . 
  they make for great polders though . 
  that +3 food is a real lifesaver . 
  well , it 's still dutch clay . 
  we kind of live here ... 
  a lot of people seem to underestimate their size . 
  as a comparison , the witcher 3 dev team was almost three times as big as the team for fallout 4 . 
  they 're relatively new on the scene , so a lot of people still have that little indie company in their minds . 
  they 've had a very explosive growth . 
  yes , your comments make that very clear ... 
  well , she 's obviously very powerful , but a key part of being a witcher are the mutations that give them superhuman strength , reflexes and allow them to drink their potions . 
  without them she 's more like a sorcerer with combat training . 
  you 're not the only person in poland and considering the average gamer is 30 years old , many people still enjoy video games despite having `` grown up '' . 
  you 're quite a bit off considering cd projekt employs [ 370 people ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/cd_projekt#/games_development ) . 
  [ even more were involved in making the witcher 3 . 
  ] ( http://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-how-much-the-witcher-3-cost-to-make/1100-6430409/ )  a total of 240 in-house staff worked on the witcher 3 ( most were polish , but a `` considerable '' number were foreigners ) , while 1,500 people in all around the world were involved in the game 's production . 
  sure , that may be small compared to bioware , but they 're no small fish anymore . 
  she 's very hotheaded and quick to make rash decisions . 
  there are several points where you have to gently calm her down if you want the best ending . 
  but ciri is n't a true witcher as she never underwent the mutations , which are said to be lethal for women anyway . 
  she certainly has the necessary powers to fight monsters , but she 's not an actual witcher . 
  some do . 
  as far as i know only greece , poland , estonia and the uk do . 
  if we have to judge europe as a whole , that 's very much the minority . 
  i guess you can interpret it both ways . 
  it can certainly be a bit less , but at least the us pays the 2 % for nato . 
  i 've never been a fan of excessive military spending , but that 's a minimum guideline for me . 
  military spending for one . 
  i suppose that 's why he said almost . 
  to account for belgium 's existence . 
  they 're absolutely terrible . 
  everything is build like you 're supposed to drive on the left !, 
  that 's a serious infrastructural problem and i 'm surprised no one has noticed yet . 
  i do n't know how the article is framed , but that does n't really mean they 're pro-kurd . 
  the kurdish * are * actually struggling to create their own state . 
  whether that 's justified is another matter . 
  even then it would be incompatible because feminism is n't about putting women in the best possible situation , but about giving them equal rights to men . 
  islam has different rules for women and men , so even if you would think women are better off than men in islam , it would still be not feminist .
