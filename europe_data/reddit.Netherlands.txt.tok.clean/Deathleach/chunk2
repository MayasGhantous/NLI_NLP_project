  still , i think it 's best for sweden to join nato , even though i doubt russia will try anything . 
  you never know though . 
  let 's just blame the french . 
  that always seems to work out . 
  thanks for the suggestion !, 
  ck2 and eu4 have definitely reignited my interest in history . 
  the games themselves should n't be taken as accurate , but they taught me a lot about the different era 's that i could then look into on my own . 
  great post . 
  i do n't even disagree with russia annexing crimea if that 's truly what the crimeans want . 
  they should 've done it in a diplomatic way though . 
  they did it militarily and not only is that indefensible on it 's own , it also sets a dangerous precedent . 
   it sounds funny , considering that the netherlands recognised independence of kosovo [ nice one . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) back to the classics i see . 
  you also make the mistake of assuming i agree with everything my country does . 
  unfortunately for you i live in a democracy where i 'm free to disagree with the actions of my government . 
  not to mention i was n't even illegible to vote in 2008 . 
  blind devotion to your country is rarely admirable . 
   while overwhelming majority of crimeans support reunification with russia this may very well be true and i 'm not necessarily opposed to crimea joining russia . 
  i am however opposed to the way russia handled it . 
  invading ukraine during a civil war and annexing crimea after a sham referendum that was set up in merely two weeks is ** not ** how you do this . 
  take a look at the scottish referendum , that 's how it should 've been done . 
  i agree that crimea will probably not be returned , however that does n't mean i 'm just going to accept it . 
  i hope the best for ukraine and i think as a nation it would be wise to give up crimea , but on a personal level i will still be against the annexation . 
  which would still make it a ukrainian matter , not a russian one . 
  just because ukraine did something wrong does n't give russia the freedom to do the same . 
  that 's because separatism is illegal in russia . 
  they have no problem encouraging separatism in foreign countries , but once you belong to mother russia there 's no escape . 
  i would call it hypocritical , but i 'm sure that russophobic . 
  just because it makes sense does n't make it right . 
  you can call it a `` just world '' narrative , but going along with it just because it `` was n't a surprise '' is absolutely stupid . 
  what do you suggest the west should do then ? 
  ignore it and happily go along with it ? 
  maybe russia should n't be surprised that the west is n't happy about such hostility in their own neighbourhood . 
  there would definitely have been a backlash . 
  they have no claim to those lands . 
  it 's still a hostile annexation . 
  if they had negotiated a diplomatic agreement with ukraine and allowed crimea to have a legitimate referendum , that would 've been skillful . 
  all they did now was roll into a weaker country that was in chaos and stole the land . 
  that 's not skillful , that 's cowardly . 
  do n't forget poland-lithuania when they do n't get fucked up in the early game . 
  to be fair , you were occupied by the ottomans and thus it 's quite relevant to your history . 
  i doubt you were taught much about the dutch golden age for example , which was quite a large part of our curriculum . 
  history lessons differ per region because you ca n't cover it all . 
  even if you could teach all of european history , there 's as much african , asian and american history as well . 
  hey now . 
  we all know the americans did most of the work . 
  in my classes it mostly went romans  romans  romans  muh dutch golden age  wwii . 
  anything beyond that was something i had to learn myself . 
  the only reason i know about the holy roman empire is ck2 . 
  i do , but i was on that bandwagon way before eu4 . 
  also , the ottomans are nothing to take lightly either . 
  well then . 
  i think we found the root of the issue here ... 
  no , i would n't be happy . 
  one woman who spouts garbage is irrelevant and can be ignored . 
  a government that arrests people for speaking their mind is much more dangerous . 
  first they 'll arrest the ones who spout garbage and everyone who agrees with that is just as guilty when they start arresting the ones with legitimate criticism . 
  she did not have it coming , because in any civilized country this should n't have happened . 
  if your first thought is : `` she had it coming '' , then your priorities are wrong . 
  it was given to ukraine during the soviet era and was retained by ukraine after the dissolution of the soviet union . 
  if russia had any objections they should have voiced them in 1991 . 
  they did n't and thus they lost any `` claims '' they had to crimea . 
  their invasion and annexation were nothing more than unprovoked hostility and to call it skilfull is a disgrace . 
  such aggression should not be tolerated . 
  finland was part of sweden for over 400 years and after that part of russia for a 100 years . 
  yet no one disputes finland 's independence . 
  no one is talking about returning kaliningrad to germany . 
  no one is talking about returning ireland to the uk . 
  no one is talking about returning norway to denmark . 
  russia has no claim to crimea or any other land for that matter . 
  eh , the uk is kinda stealing their shine in that department . 
  even the image is terrible . 
  jpeg the size of an ant . 
  it takes incompetence to find such an image . 
  [ wikipedia has a perfectly servicable one .

  agreed on all points . 
  i feel verenigd koninkrijk der nederlanden could work as you are still part of the `` netherlands '' if you see it as a translation of lage landen . 
  however , if we 're going to unite i 'd rather get rid of the monarchy and form a republic . 
  as long as we do n't call it greater wallonia . 
  i 'm game , but we 're not calling it belgium . 
  this only confirms you rightly belong to us . 
  a combination of polandball , [ this ] ( http://zapatopi.net/belgium/ ) and belgium being such a `` divided '' nation . 
  it 's basically a meme . 
  i do , they 're pretty great . 
  \\  tfw eurovision is merely a disguise for eu imperialism it seems fitting that we would conquer them through bureaucracy instead of military might . 
  actual land is overrated . 
  everyone knows polders are superior because of the food bonus . 
  do n't forget the terrible roads , being invaded and not being a country !, 
  if it was polandball , that would say `` is drown '' . 
  the legal status of prostitution and soft drugs is n't really because we as a society like those things . 
  it 's still looked down upon if you visit a prostitute or if you do drugs . 
  the reason they 're legal is because we do n't think people should be punished for doing things we do n't like ( as long as they do n't harm others ) . 
   ** world ** series  only ** americans ** does not compute . 
  in my mind everyone with a polish flair on this sub is a ball-shaped flag with a plumber . 
  with such a large margin they do deserve it . 
  now everyone will vote abstain just to spite both groups . 
  like he would notice . 
  is it really reporting if they 're your own insults ? 
  what happens when you divide by zero ?
