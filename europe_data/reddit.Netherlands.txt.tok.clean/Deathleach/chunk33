  if you act like an asshole , i 'm going to think you 're an asshole . 
  claiming it 's a `` character '' is n't going to change that . 
  i 'll take actual evidence over some anecdotal askreddit thread . 
  you guys wan na join the eu ? 
  that 's british level bantz and we 've got a position open . 
  2 years after triggering article 50 : `` they 'll cave any second now ! '', 
  - the british government, 
  do n't worry , the british tag will suffice :p, 
  in the netherlands everyone 's vote is worth the same , at least during the parliamentary elections . 
  there 's a bit of rounding involved when assigning the seats , but that 's unavoidable . 
  excuse me !, 
  we own half of that !, 
  see ? 
  the brits are n't so different from us continentals . 
  like it would have mattered . 
  unfortunately the hague court does n't apply to larger countries . 
  it 's like portugal , but poor . 
  if i need shift to a lower gear on my bike , then it 's a mountain . 
  you should check out the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaalserberg ) for our highest point . 
  we call it the vaalserberg or mount vaals in english . 
  especially the first sentence should illuminate what we call a mountain . 
   ** the vaalserberg is a hill ** with a height of 322.7 metres ( 1,059 ft ) above nap and the highest point in mainland netherlands . 
   in his right mind as a frenchie you should know this . 
  we 're talking about the british . 
  what about us ? 
  you do n't like our cheese ? 
  ~ ~ i usually just drink it straight from my victims neck . ~ ~ wait , what were we talking about ? 
  in a sort of roundabout way that would solve the problem . 
  it would be better if all the states just agreed to allocate electors proportionately , even if it was only for the symbolic gesture , but you ca n't have everything . 
  i do n't see how that 's relevant to what i 'm saying . 
  we do n't live in ancient greece , nor do i think we should emulate them . 
  fair enough , i did n't know that . 
  in practice it basically always works that way though ( except for maine and nebraska as far as i can see ) and it 's one of the biggest problems with the american system . 
  i personally disagree with the electoral system on principle , but i can see its merits . 
  fptp though is breeding resentment and polarising the population . 
  one of the ways to heal the ever increasing divide in america should be to get rid of it . 
  i mean , democracy is almost literally rule of the majority . 
  one of its problems is that tyranny of the majority is something that can occur , but the constitution and human rights should prevent that . 
  getting rid of the electoral college does n't mean that rural people will be ignored , but that their vote weighs the exact same as the vote of an urban person . 
  besides , the bigger states are n't monolithic . 
  almost 4 million people in california voted for donald trump and they were ignored when all the points were handed to clinton . 
  well , sometimes compassion for the innocents sentenced to death does n't convince people , so then all i 'm left with is cruelty for those who are guilty . 
  but on the other hand the current system breeds resentment against the establishment and the opposite party . 
  you say that southern california is carrying clinton , but on the other hand those 4 million republicans in california had literally zero say in who was going to become president . 
  those 4 millions votes for trump were ignored and all the points were handed to clinton . 
  same thing goes for texas and basically every other state . 
  that 's one thing that often gets ignored . 
  in a popular vote system , california would no longer give all its points to the democrats and texas would no longer give all points to the republicans . 
  just like the us itself those large states are n't homogeneous and a popular vote might increase voter turnout . 
  right now if you lose with 49 % your party gets nothing , while in a popular vote system you would get 49 % of electors . 
  the electoral college might give more power to smaller states , but it steals that power from the minorities in bigger states . 
  you do n't even really need to get rid of the electoral college ( though i personally would ) , but assigning electors based on percentages instead of winner takes all might already remedy it a bit . 
  you 're right , without the electoral college california does outnumber wyoming . 
  however wyoming does n't stand alone . 
  there 's a dozen of other republican states that would vote with them . 
  the point of the electoral college is that ** all ** points go to the winner of the state , instead of a proportional number . 
  in the electoral college wyoming might get a bigger voice , but instead millions of republicans in california are now silenced because their vote was literally worth nothing . 
  they voted republican but all the points went to the democrats . 
  trump got 3,9 million votes that were completely disregarded . 
  same thing goes for democrats in texas and basically every other state . 
  now in reality this might be more of a problem with fptp , but combined with the electoral college it just creates a very undemocratic system . 
   the american system is obviously not perfect but i think it 's silly to get angry thinking about it . 
  american has done pretty freaking well for itself over the last 150 years . 
  much better than europe and much of that is due to the system . 
  i would disagree with this . 
  i 'd say america has done very well despite their system , but as we can see now it has created resentment and polarisation in the populace . 
  millions of people , both democrat and republican , have had their voices ignored by this system and that 's partly why there 's such an anti-establishment feeling in the us . 
  you should also take note that europe was recovering from wwii and many of the countries there were victims of the soviet union . 
  that 's not to diminish america 's achievements , but it 's a bit of an unfair comparison . 
  it 's almost like the quote part in quotation is n't just there for fun . 
  yea , fptp is probably a bigger problem than the electoral college , but i still oppose it on principle . 
  as you say , it was designed to avoid a small majority screwing over a large minority , but now we have the opposite where a large minority is screwing with the small majority . 
  in general i think the american political system has a lot of small problems that turn it into a large problem . 
  the electoral college on its own might work , but combined with fptp , gerrymandering , etc , it just turns into this unworkable system that polarises the national debate and makes everyone angry at everyone else . 
  oh , i do n't dispute that the system is working as designed , but that does n't mean it 's democratic . 
  in a democracy the vote of a farmer should have the same weight as the vote of a banker . 
  what 's happening now in the us is that the votes of rural people are worth more than the votes of urban people . 
  whether that 's desirable or not is debatable ( i would say it 's not desirable ) , but i do n't think you can argue that it 's undemocratic . 
  in their desire to limit the domination of a few population centers they 've made it so that now the election is decided by only a few swing states . 
  this is then further complicated by first past the post , where the winner takes all the electoral votes instead of merely a percentage of corresponding to the number of votes they received . 
  if you vote republican in california or democrat in texas , your vote is basically worthless . 
  if getting 60 % of votes meant you get 60 % of the electoral votes of that state it would at least alleviate a bit of the democratic deficiency . 
  i know . 
  it would probably be one of the worst constitutional crises the us has ever seen . 
  even clinton would probably check out at that point . 
  but still , the little voice in the back of my mind that wanted trump to win just to see what would happen , would be absolutely delighted . 
  they 're afraid that they ca n't fit themselves in anymore once you use more than four fingers . 
  what did you just say about my mother ? 
  fair enough , i 'll bow to your explanation :p . jonkheer is indeed a quite nebulous term . 
  i do love seeing dutch names in games though . 
  it 's so rare that whenever it happens it feels really awesome in a `` yay , we 're relevant ! '', 
  kind of way . 
  i 'll agree with that . 
  the rules were known beforehand so we should n't tamper with them now . 
  i just think most people who bring up the popular vote do it to show the problems with the electoral college itself and do n't expect it to change the result . 
  then again , the electoral college can still hand the presidency to clinton , although that has never happened before . 
  it would be the cherry on the top of this election though . 
  when you thought it could n't get crazier than this ... 
  i 'm in favour of the death penalty for many crimes ( like murder , slavery , torture , etc ) , but i recognise that no justice system is infallible and even sentencing one innocent person to death is too much of a price for me . 
  therefore i 'm in favour of lifetime without parole , because it 's cheaper , reversible and probably worse than the death penalty .
