  that 's quite the mouthful . 
  * czechoslovenia ftfy . 
  easy mistake to make . 
  it can be both the fascist fourth reich and eussr at the same time , so why not add the intermarium while we 're at it . 
  do n't worry , you do n't live in a well functioning democracy . 
  this means you 're completely blameless !, 
  hurrah !, 
  morocco is a different color than portugal , so i 'm not sure why you would say that it 's portuguese territory in this map . 
  that makes sense . 
  we just wanted to make the belgians look ridiculous . 
  i would say getting from point a to b is more important for a car than looking good , as it is a means of transportation . 
  if you want something nice to look at , buy some flowers or something . 
  but the oecd is headquartered in paris and is not related to the eu . 
  i mean , that same article lists the abs islands as all being on the south american shelf . 
  so therefore you can argue they 're south american . 
  i believe the nato border dispute thing is more of a guideline than an actual rule . 
  west germany joined , despite having a much larger border dispute over east germany . 
  hell , up until recently you still had a dispute with us over the borders of the ems estuary . 
  you mean greecedonia ? 
  no android phones !, 
  #notmypresident ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ because ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ french , ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ let 's ^ ^ ^ ignore ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ now ... 
  yes , but i believe the abc islands are actually part of the south american plate . 
  besides , continents are n't defined by tectonic plates alone , other wise europe would n't be a continent and india and arabia would be . 
  well , you could argue that the abc islands are part of south america , as they basically hug venezuela , while sint maarten , saba and sint eustatius are north american because they 're part of the caribbean island chain . 
   i guess france did n't want to interfere too much with the local culture that does n't sound like france at all !, 
  hey , that was our gimmick !, 
  *** merkelreich intensifies ***, 
  you 're going to have to make do with some space slug . 
   avoid balkanizing things  the balkans does not compute . 
  they missed all the fun last time !, 
  that 's like saying why are the flairs that did n't go to the ice cream parlor last time , the most excited about getting ice cream . 
  of course , but you 're asking why this is suddenly a problem and i explained why . 
  unfortunately when a boy is circumcised by both the parents there is no one to advocate for the boy , so the issue is never raised . 
  that 's why we should n't let the doctor have to decide , it should just be banned outright . 
  mutilating a child because they might find someone less capable of mutilating him safely should not be a reason for it to be legal . 
   if it 's done at the ` traditional ' age the psychological damage is nil by the way . 
  source ? 
  because there is definitely [ evidence to the contrary ] ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201501/circumcision-s-psychological-damage ) . 
   say no : the parents leave with their kid . 
  one month later you 'll see the kid again in er : some quack has cut in his penis and now it 's having complications . 
  this already happens while circumcision is still legal , as evidenced by this article . 
  by making it illegal you save hundreds of boys from having their bodily autonomy violated and not having to suffer immense pain because of the procedure . 
   there 's worse things to combat here , like female circumcision . 
  i 'm perfectly capable of being concerned with multiple things at once . 
  besides , fgm is already banned and considered barbaric by most people . 
  there 's no further action to take besides enforcing the laws we already have . 
  not to mention that fgm is an umbrella term for various degrees of circumcision and some of the milder ones are pretty comparable to male circumcision . 
  i could use most of your arguments to say that the milder form should be legal . 
  they 're still banned regardless and so should male circumcision . 
  non-female ? 
  `` if you ask one more time i 'll cut you , understand ? '', 
  considering most people in europe are n't circumcised and most people in europe also do n't have a penis infection , i would say yes . 
  cutting of parts of children is barbaric , no matter how you look at it . 
  you 're misreading it . 
  there 's 10 guns for every ** 100 ** people worldwide , so that means 0,1 guns per person . 
  the us on the other hand has 112 guns per 100 people , which means there 's 1,12 guns per person in the us . 
  therefore the us is the only country in the world with more guns than people . 
  because normally both parents agree , so there 's no one to advocate for the child as he ca n't do it himself . 
  i 'm glad the mother saw it was wrong and decided to do something about it . 
  because most porn is made by americans and they circumcise their children for cultural reasons . 
   i was n't really talking about this particular subject , just wanted to debunk medical horror stories about the subject . 
  that was n't very clear , because nowhere did the person you replied to state that it was dangerous at all . 
  he called it barbaric , which it is even when performed by a medical professional . 
  even if the child in this story was circumcised by a medical professional with both the parents consent , it would still be barbaric . 
   for example : i had never had / heard of smegma before one of my uncircumcised buddies explained it to me at like age 12/13 . 
  as someone who 's uncircumcised , this has never been an issue for me because my parents taught me to clean my dick . 
  just washing it whenever you take a shower is more than enough to avoid smegma for the rest of your life . 
  it 's a matter of basic hygiene that most people do anyway . 
  you might as well start cutting of toes to avoid toe cheese . 
  fgm is an umbrella term for various degrees of female circumcision . 
  some of those degrees are comparable to male circumcision , even if the higher degrees are much worse . 
  the point is that all degrees of fgm are banned , while for males the lower degrees are still perfectly legal . 
  i mean , technically males do have the right to not be mutilated , but when those rights are n't enforced even when people go to the police , it 's not that outlandish to say male children have less rights than dogs ( where to rights * are * enforced ) . 
  from a legal standpoint she 's wrong , but from a realistic standpoint she 's right . 
  hopefully her actions make it so that these rights start being enforced again . 
   theres no negative effects of having a penis without foreskin except , you know . 
  the immense pain you had as an infant when it happened . 
  just because you do n't remember it now does n't mean you did n't suffer when it happened . 
  there 's also no negative effects to having a penis with a foreskin , so cutting it off is an unnecessary treatment which you should 've had complete control over . 
  just because you do n't have any negative effects now does n't mean it was n't a violation of your bodily autonomy . 
  there 's also people who did n't want to be circumcised , but ca n't get it back now because circumcision is permanent . 
  if the status quo is that infants ca n't be circumcised then you can still decide later when you 're an adult to get circumcised . 
  it does n't work the other way around . 
  that seems unlikely to me . 
  do people who had their arms or legs amputated for medical reasons think they were mutilated just because it 's mutilation when someone forces it on you ? 
  the reason it is mutilation is based around consent , not that circumcision is automatically mutilation . 
  and it 's not like we never talk about medical reasons . 
  it 's just that in the context of this conversation ( circumcising little boys without their consent ) it 's fairly irrelevant and often just a side note that everyone agrees on . 
  we have already reached a consensus on that topic . 
  it 's not about whether it 's actually harmful or not , it 's about the fact that it 's a massive violation of bodily autonomy for no reason at all . 
  if i get a professional tattoo artist to tattoo my newborn that 's also perfectly fine and unlikely to cause problems . 
  however , it 's still a permanent change to a baby 's body for no reason but the whims of the parents . 
  the only reason circumcision is okay and tattooing is not , is because we were historically okay with it , not because it 's somehow not as bad . 
   do n't decide for others what 's good for them . 
  i 'm glad we agree that deciding to cut off someone else 's foreskin is not okay . 
  nobody brings up circumcision for medical reasons , because it 's obviously not a problem . 
  whenever these threads happen there 's always someone going `` but what if it 's for medical reasons ? '', 
  and the replies are always `` obviously that 's okay , why does it even need to be said ? '' . 
  when we 're talking about male circumcision , 99 % of the time we 're talking about doing it for non-medical reasons . 
  there 's no reason to bring up medically necessary circumcision , because there 's no debate about whether that 's right or wrong .
