  it `` seemed to work okay '' if you define success as the deaths of millions around the world in the two most destructive armed conflicts we have seen to date . 
  baudet , who founded fvd , has openly praised putin for his `` assertive leadership '' . 
  both trump and wilders use twitter as a channel to make their statements . 
  that 's where they have full control over the form and content of their messages and they do n't risk having to face any critical questions . 
  both these guys do n't care much about explaining their policies or making thoughtful arguments so 140 characters ( or so ) are plenty . 
  their `` hair '' is an extraterrestial species . 
  these beings ride their hosts like a jockey and control their thoughts and actions . 
  they are vanguard agents trying to sow chaos and confusion on earth ahead of a full-blown invasion from space . 
   or maybe the church and state are expressing shock that nuns in mid-20th century ireland could have so little regard for the lives and deaths of children in their care . 
  the ryan report in 2009 documented the systematic sexual , physical and emotional abuse of children in church-run , state-funded institutions . 
  it revealed that when confronted with evidence of child abuse , the church would transfer abusers to other institutions , where they could abuse other children . 
  the christian brothers legally blocked the report from naming and shaming its members . 
  meanwhile , cardinal se\u00e1n brady -- now known to have participated in the cover-up of abuse by paedophile priest brendan smyth -- muttered about how ashamed he was . 
   the same year , the murphy report on the sexual abuse of children in the archdiocese of dublin revealed that the catholic church 's priorities in dealing with paedophilia were not child welfare , but rather secrecy , the avoidance of scandal , the protection of its reputation and the preservation of church assets . 
  in 2013 , the mcaleese report documented the imprisonment of more than 10,000 women in church-run , state-funded laundries , where they worked in punitive industrial conditions without pay for the crime of being unmarried mothers . 
   so you will forgive me if i am sceptical of the professed shock of ireland 's clergy , politicians and official inquiring bodies . 
  we know too much about the catholic church 's abuse of women and children to be shocked by tuam . 
  [ ... ] hundreds of dead babies are not an asset to those invested in the myth of an abortion-free ireland ; they inconveniently suggest that catholic ireland always had abortions , just very late-term ones , administered slowly by nuns after the children were already born . 
  do i need to go on quoting from that piece you did n't read but felt the need to be a wise-ass about ? 
  to each country their own , i suppose . 
  i do n't think this is a `` mess '' to be honest . 
  it 's exciting to see so many different perspectives being represented and reassuring to know that , whatever the outcome of the formation , the incoming government will represent the votes of at least half of the population . 
  i would n't ever want to trade it for fptp . 
   vvd - ** liberal **  cda - ** liberal ** - christian wtf ?? 
  these parties have made a massive conservative turn the past couple of years . 
  ukip actually rejected the pvv 's proposal to form an alliance in the ep . 
  the pvv does n't give a damn about key conservative principles like individual freedom and putting brakes on state power . 
  ukip does work together with vnl , which has been set up by people who left the pvv . 
  i 've seen your name on here before and i know you 've made up your mind about the world , but i will always be amazed by the people who call the eu a `` 4th reich '' and then cuddle up with a former kgb agent who is still miffed about russia 's loss of power after 1990 and who routinely jails / intimidates / kills dissenters and invades neighbouring countries . 
  but that 's probably because i 'm brainwashed or whatever . 
  get your head out of ... there . 
  nobody is going to invade uk for any reason . 
  you 're not * that * special or important . 
  do n't incite the frisian separatists !, 
  interesting . 
  i think what you describe is a nightmare scenario for wilders and his pvv here in nl . 
  wilders keeps his foot down on dissenters and all major decisions are made by him alone . 
  anyone who disagrees with him either leaves the party of their own accord ( more or less ) or gets kicked out eventually . 
  this has given his party some form of stability ( he 's been going at it for 10 + years now ) but it also severely limits his reach , because he can only control so many people at any one time . 
  but i guess that 's just the way it is on that part of the political spectrum . 
  imagine having to be * that * worried about the people supposed to be your allies . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%a9si_bouterse desi bouterse took power a couple of years after they gained independence , he made a pretty big mess of things . 
  i have n't been to france in too long , but i actually ate tons of these in morocco as well . 
  most hotels i stayed in had them . 
  their votes are n't worth nothing . 
  they still get representation in parliament . 
  but it 's not just about programs or ideology . 
  wilders has proven to be an impossible person to work with . 
  he made an ass of himself by pulling the rug out from under the gedoogcoalitie thing - rutte has n't forgotten about that yet . 
  what 's more , wilders himself has stated that he would n't govern together with the vvd unless rutte were to step down . 
  okay , that was like a year ago but i do n't think i 've ever seen wilders go back on what he says . 
  cordon sanitaire , my rear . 
  so he blew his first shot at governing for no other reason than that he could n't stand the heat in the kitchen ; second , he demands that the leader of that same party he betrayed steps down because he does n't like him ; third , he thinks that 's all totally normal and acceptable behaviour and other people should just roll over and accommodate his every tantrum . 
  i ca n't even express how absolutely ridiculous wilders is behaving as a policitian . 
  he 's not even * trying * to make himself a viable option to work with , not even towards the parties he 's more or less ideologically compatible with . 
  you can talk about `` undemocratic '' all you want , wilders ' failures are 100 % his own . 
  but we 'll waste lots of time and resources that we very much need right now . 
  we need good , solid policy to maintain our post-recession recovery . 
  and wilders is going to blame anyone and everyone but himself for his failings , like he has always done . 
  i recall an official eu statement about two years ago that snowden would be allowed to travel unimpeded within the eu and that member states promised not to hand him over to us authorities . 
  that 's not the same as asylum , and i 'm not sure how much protection it would grant him against actual cia operations , but maybe the eu could expand on that . 
  well that 's interesting then , because here in amsterdam we 've already had snow since wednesday and it has n't gone away . 
  we 've had some more snowfall this afternoon actually . 
  it 's not a huge amount but still . 
  / pol / is an open thing , you know . 
  anyone can walk in an put up whatever . 
  you people should drop the childish idea that you can troll everyone on the internet without being trolled back . 
  also : you 're a one day old account , hah . 
   i 'm not getting any money from the spd , soros , clinton or whomever that leaves but one possibility ... r/the _ schulz is funded by intergalactic lizards , confirmed . 
  but for real , i love your sub . 
  i often get a laugh out of all the euphoric memes and it 's really interesting that the spd has taken note as well . 
  at first i really thought the video with schulz addressing the sub was fake , but then he started with `` liebe reddit user ... '' . 
  that was really cool . 
  thanks for starting that sub  it was a great idea . 
  all the footage and photos the last couple of days have been amazing to see . 
  the people of romania are showing the world how to keep a government accountable . 
  all the best to you , you 're on our minds as well !, 
  i 'm not sure if it 's possible , but i 'm not versed in law . 
  perhaps if a majority in parliament is in favour of it happening , but that would be extremely unlikely here . 
  other than that : the pvv has a history of getting far fewer votes than what 's predicted by the polls . 
  it might be different this time around given recent world events , but overestimation of wilders ' support has definitely been a thing throughout the past couple of elections . 
  we 'll have to see . 
  in the event that wilders becomes the largest party , he will still have to form a coalition with 2 or 3 other parties . 
  wilders is completely incompatible with any parties on the left . 
  on the right , he has governed with the vvd ( conservative liberals ) in the past , but he scuttled that coalition , leading to grudges between him and the vvd leadership to this day . 
  wilders has also made the ridiculous demand that if the vvd were to govern together with the pvv , the former will have to get rid of mark rutte first - he 's their current leader and our prime minister . 
  that wo n't happen , because rutte is popular among his base and they consider him a very succesful pm . 
  to be fair , wilders made that demand over a year ago and i do n't know how he feels about that now , but then again he 's not someone who likes to go back on what he says . 
  the elections will be interesting . 
  three new right wing populist/nationalist parties have sprung up recently and will try to gain a seat in parliament . 
  it 's impossible to tell what kind of effect that would have . 
  there have been armed marechaussee people in front of the visitor 's entrance to the tweede kamer as of late though . 
  but you can walk right on in without any appointment as long as you show id and pass through a metal detector . 
  last time i was there anyway . 
  but yeah , you 're right , it feels like a very public place . 
  you can walk around the courtyard and have your own cameo on the evening news when the reporters are around . 
  and if i 'm not mistaken , the tower on the corner on the left in the picture houses the prime minister 's personal office and is often simply referred to as '' the little tower '' . 
  it may not look like much but many historically significant conversations have taken place there . 
  well , do n't forget to tip your fedora after a pedantic over-the-top post like that . 
  i wish nothing but the best for people in the us and europe both , but with an unhinged , unstable narcissist at the helm it 's sometimes difficult to see how things can work out well for everyone .
