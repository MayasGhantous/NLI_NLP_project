ah thanks . 
  like i said , beyond their immigration policies i do n't know much about afd . 
  7 percent of previous linke voters picked afd in 2016 . 
  the overlap between the far left and far right always surprised me . 
  yeah , i get the reasoning . 
  both anti-establishment , often both anti-austerity ( as a dutchy , i do n't know what 's afd 's take on austerity though ) , but there 's still an amount of political inconsistency with these voters that seriously bothers me . 
  you 're saying i 'm wrong ? 
  if a private entity hires a swimming pool for a day of use , then i do n't think the government should have anything to say about the dress code . 
  i thought the right wing generally agreed with that sentiment ? 
  it 's hired by a private party for a day . 
  so yeah , in my view it 's non of our business . 
  it 's not like a public swimming pool sets this dress code , which would be an awful thing in my opinion . 
  yes , you need to call down . 
  it 's an f-ing private party hiring the place for a day . 
  they could be swimming in space suits for all i care . 
  if they hire they place they can set the dress code , that 's how it works . 
  go protest at your local nightclub as well if you have a problem with that . 
  just to clear this up , i 'm copying the top comment here :   a waterpark in france is to be booked out for one day to muslim women wanting to wear `` burkinis ''   they 're hiring the place , let them wear rubber chickens on their heads for what difference it makes . 
    everyone just needs to fucking chill out a bit - if a group books out a resort , the group can set the dress code . 
   this has nothing to do with islam taking over . 
  if a private party hires the place , they can set the dress code . 
  i got called a regressive muslim apologist for objecting to the statement that ` the average muslim supports these attacks ' . 
  one guy said all muslims need to be deported , when i asked where you deport people who are born here , another one replied gas chambers . 
  another guy said it 's time that we hang muslims on every street corner . 
  i was too stupid to understand we 're in a state of undeclared war . 
  and that is just a small sample of the wonderful bright minds on / r/worldnews yesterday . 
  yes , i completely agree with you . 
  that 's why the shifting political landscape in europe ( and not only europe ) worries me . 
  she is the biggest , by far , in the first round . 
  she 's on 30 % , only beaten by juppe in some of the polls . 
  although i have to admit that i did not check the second round . 
  she only beats hollande in the polling ( lol who does n't ) there , and loses to everyone else . 
  so chances are it 'll just be a ump/republican administration again . 
  yeah , president of course . 
  thanks for correcting me . 
  regardless , my point does not change . 
  she 's on top of the polls for the first round by a large margin . 
  you know she 's leading in the polls , by far . 
  ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election,_2017 ) ) edit : in the first round that is . 
  so my point is kinda moot . 
  lol , have you followed french politics * at all * lately ? 
  front nationale is getting more popular every day . 
  there 's a very good chance le pen will be france 's next president . 
  while i would honestly fear for such a scenario , the establishment had it coming . 
  they have failed the people on multiple issues . 
  edit : president , not pm of course . 
  three people are badly injured . 
  they could be permanently damaged , or worse die from their wounds . 
  this guy gets away easy , without any punishment for his crimes . 
  on the other hand , while i 'm usually not the kind of guy who favours hard punishment . 
  i kinda fear he could get away with a ridiculously low punishment because he 's underage . 
  ( or , he claims to be ) in the end , nobody died except for the attacker . 
  so you could call it a happy ending , but it 's a bittersweet one . 
  well , the deal greece signed with the troika is pretty much modern-day occupation . 
  they literally agreed to not have * any * legislation passed unless it 's approved by the institutions . 
  ( [ link ] ( https://youtu.be/mijfygio4xa?t=12m15s ) ), 
  your account is 12 hours old and literally every comment you made is bashing muslims . 
  is there something you need to get off your chest , bud ? 
  nah , this is almost two years ago . 
  we 've improved a lot since then !, 
  ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ kidding ^ ^ ^ :'(, 
  so which polls were completely unreliable again ? 
  the brexit that was just 4 % off , or the us election that was off by a mere 1 ? 
  ( making it more accurate than usual ) can we please stop with the ridiculous notion that polls were proved to be unreliable ? 
  the political experts were wrong , but the polls were not . 
  the npo and avrotros said to the ad however that the story is completely bogus . 
  `` this is absolutely not the case '' . 
  you should tell the complete story , these are unconfirmed allegations . 
  they even tried to research these allegations , and there 's no hint of these stories being true . 
  ( [ see this ] ( https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/ministerie-van-onderwijs-cultuur-en-wetenschap/documenten/kamerstukken/2014/10/27/kamerbrief-over-het-tv-programma-opsporing-verzocht ) ) also , sure we 've got some groups that love playing the victim . 
  but the notion that the left in general is playing identity politics is simply not true . 
  the pc sjw stereotype is very rare in dutch politics . 
  unless you want to suggest sylvana simons is a mainstream political figure . 
  yes , but is being ` pro-immigrant ' the same as playing identity politics ? 
  because i see a clear distinction . 
  i do agree with you when you say that the overall sentiment is ` less immigration ' though . 
  i 'd be the last one to deny that . 
  you do n't have a netherlands variation in danish ? 
  i know in swedish they 've got nederl\u00e4nderna , but in regular tongue it 's more common to just call it holl\u00e4nd . 
  especially holl\u00e4ndska instead of nederl\u00e4nderska is the typical way to say ` dutch ' . 
  i 'm a bit surprised that there 's no danish distinction here . 
  that does give a point to the swedes , you danskj\u00e4vla . 
  to answer your question . 
  no we 're not offended at all . 
  we chant ` holland ' during soccer matches ourselves , instead of ` nederland ' for example . 
  most dutch people recognise that ` holland ' has a better name recognition in some countries . 
  you can expect people to correct you though . 
  but not out of spite . 
  regular dutch with a heavy german accent gets surprisingly close to german already . 
  as a dutch person , this sounds like dutch with a ( bit weird ) thick german accent to me . 
  no , i 'm just an extremist communist apparently by taking a position that would be considered center-left fourty years ago . 
  anything substantial where i am obviously wrong ? 
  seriously , you deny d66 being a progressive party ? 
  dude , i usually vote socialist party . 
  do you think i see d66 as ideological allies ? 
  they 're big neoliberals ( pro-market ) , economically absolutely to the right . 
  i too see d66 as right-wing in general . 
  but when it comes to immigration and refugees , d66 is to the left of the sp . 
  ( ignoring the classical left-right spectrum about economics . 
  that 's why i used the term progressive instead of left ) maybe we simply disagree on language here .
