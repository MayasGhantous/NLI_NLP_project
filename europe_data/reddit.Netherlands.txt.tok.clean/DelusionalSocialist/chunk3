  denk is basically a turkish pvda . 
  center-left , right to both gl and the sp . 
  quite stable . 
  we 've had these majorities before and it are all parties that tend to make concessions in order to govern . 
  i 'm not happy with the combination * at all * , but it would n't worry about it being unstable . 
  they 've got a free version as well , but it has some ads iirc . 
  denial is not just a river in egypt . 
  these guys got to be a special kind of stupid . 
  i never said you should be jealous ? 
  also that 's very unlikely to be true . 
  just for the sample fact that the netherlands is not relevant for the us while us elections are always a major news topic in dutch media . 
  you need 0.67 % of the vote to get a seat in national parliament . 
  we count everything by hand . 
  so it takes a bit longer than for example us elections . 
  have you seen the forms ? 
  they 're huge . 
  hahahahahahaha . 
  this beats any kind of satire ;-), 
  they 're general pro-immigration . 
  d66 is pretty much the biggest opponent of geert wilders . 
  as a left-winger i 'm not happy with the results . 
  but as a european i 'm relieved , populism did n't win . 
  i can live with the regular right . 
  a stable europe is important for us all . 
   100 % turnout ? 
  sounds like possible voter fraud liked that one as well :'), 
  yes , probably the most pro-eu party in parliament . 
  vvd/d66/cda / gl is literally one of the just two logical options ? 
  they 've got a much better chance than the pvv . 
  dutch nationalism only meets during soccer games and on kings day . 
  which makes me think , i 'm happy we do n't have elections during the world cup . 
  on that note , was n't wilders ' 2010 victory ( 24 seats ) during the soccer wc ? 
  i see a political theory forming !, 
  ( not really being serious here ), 
  slightly to the right , but it 's not really an outspoken swing . 
  see this page with the polling aggregates ( in dutch , but the graphs should be clear ) : http://peilingwijzer.tomlouwerse.nl/2017/03/peilingwijzer-slotupdate-maart-2017.html?m=1, 
  it 's pretty simple . 
  they 're very pro-market , which is associated with the right wing/conservatism . 
  on social issues they 're very progressive , but economically they 're further to the right . 
  but what part is ` not a surprise ' then ? 
  i 'm mostly happy about all foreign media being so wrong about wilders having a solid change . 
  return with the vvd no less . 
  except for d66 of course . 
  he almost did n't campaign at all , refused to participate in 2/3 debates as well . 
  he ran a terrible campaign , it 's not super surprising actually . 
  huh ? 
  pvv is not near the top party in these exit polls . 
  pvdd had two seats and grows to five . 
  19 seats , that 's 12.7 %, 
  wow , judging from the titles of the two megathreads the french elections are * a lot * more interesting than the dutch ones . 
  that 's once the polls close at 21:00 ( gmt +1 ) . 
  so that 's in one hour and 40 minutes . 
  they do n't have it up yet . 
  if i remember it , i 'll send you a direct link once it 's up . 
  it 'll probably somewhere on nos.nl . 
  if you manage to navigate that . 
  most importantly , uitslag = results , verkiezingen = elections . 
  oops , yeah that 's right , fixed it . 
  turnout is probably going to be ~ 80 % according to the polling stations . 
  yes , nos will have such a website up tonight . 
  ah , right thanks . 
  fixed . 
  i think he will , but i agree that he should n't . 
  in the past gl specifcially called for paarsplus ( vvd , pvda , d66 , gl ) . 
  they wanted to cut ww-period , wanted to make it easier for employers to fire people and one of their pm actually publicaly said they should get rid of the ` left ' in their name . 
  i think * that * version of groenlinks will participate in such a coalition . 
  but times have changed , almost the entire board of gl has been fired and their platform is clearly left-wing again . 
  whether they will participate in such a construction depends on the sincerity of this shift . 
  but yes , coalition with vvd and gl , without the cda is certainly possible . 
  that would be some paarsplus ( vvd , pvda , d66 , gl ) coalition which gl has specifically called for in the past . 
  it probably does not have a majority though , but it is possible if you add cu to them . 
  ( 73 seats in eenvandaag , so could certainly get 76 tonight ) but yeah , i think going in a coalition with both vvd and cda will be very painful for klaver . 
  his best option ( electoraly speaking ) would be the center-left cabinet . 
  but given the fact that all coalitions will be painful , i think they will seriously consider . 
  if they gain enough in the negotiations i do n't think they 'll walk away . 
  but that 's my personal opinion . 
  vvd , cda , d66 , pvda , cu is the other obvious choice . 
  pvda will be pretty cautious ( they already got punished hard for governing with the vvd , i 'm not sure if they want to do that again ) , but i think it 's on the table for them yes . 
  for the non-dutch people here , here 's a little write-up about our likely next government . 
  here i used the polls from eenvandaag whenever i name a number of seats . 
  it 'd be better to use the peilingwijzer which takes the average and accounts for in-house effects ( like fivethirtyeight with the us elections ) , but eenvandaag has a nice tool where you can make your own coalition based on the polls . 
  a little disclaimer , i tried to remain neutral but i do want to give my personal bias here . 
  i usually vote sp , this election i was really uncertain for a long time though . 
  i was undecided between groenlinks , sp and pvdd . 
  in the end i voted for pvdd as climate was the most important issue for me . 
  i did n't opt for groenlinks as i have trust issues with that party . 
  ( they have a very nice program this year , but they were basically a copy of d66 ( very pro-market ) in 2010 . 
  i will probably vote for them next election if they keep this message up , but for now i do n't know if i can trust them yet ) without further adue , here 's my writeup : the most likely winner ( largest party , they 're bound to lose seats ) of the election is the vvd . 
  which means they 'll get the initiative to form a coalition . 
  with the vvd heading the coalition , i see the following realistic options : ** - vvd , d66 , gl , cda ( 77 seats ) ** this coalition has a small majority , but i do n't think they 've got a majority in the senate . 
  the biggest issue here is groenlinks , they 've campaigned on a real left-wing platform and they 're hte only real left-wing party in this coalition . 
  d66 is very progressive , but not so left-wing on an economic scale ( they 're pro free-market so to speak ) . 
  so groenlinks really needs to do serious compromises . 
  the big advantage of this coalition is that this is a coalition of only winning parties plus the vvd . 
  my guess is that this would be a fairly progressive cabinet ( not too much , cda is more conservative ) and they 'd put some serious emphasis on climate change . 
  ( or else gl will never choose for this option , remember they need something substantial to accept this ) an option would be to add pvda to this list . 
  this would give them a comfortable majority , and gl would not be the only left-wing party in this cabinet . 
  it 'd be a bit harder to govern though , with so much differing parties . 
  christenunie ( left wing christian party , socially conservative but pretty green and for a decent welfare state ) could be added as well . 
  ** - vvd , cda , cu , d66 , pvda ( 78 seats ) ** similar to above , but less green .
