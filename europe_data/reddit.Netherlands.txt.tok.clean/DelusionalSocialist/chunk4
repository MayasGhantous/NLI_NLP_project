  this would be an option if gl does n't want that construction . 
  however , pvda will probably lose 20 to 30 seats ( from 39 in 2012 ) because of their coalition with the vvd . 
  going that route again would be electoral suicide , but maybe they think there 's not much too lose now anyway . 
  but i think pvda will be very cautious in this construction . 
  in this coalition you could also get rid of d66 and use gl instead . 
  but i think d66 is ideologically closer to this construction as a while than gl . 
  so getting rid of d66 here does not make a lot of sense . 
  i think it will definitely be something along these lines , most likely the top one . 
  but obviously that wo n't be easy , so there 's a few more options below : ------------- the thing people really want to know is , what are the odds of pvv governing ? 
  well , close to zero . 
  remember we need 76 seats , and most parties excluded the possibility . 
  ignoring that part , the non-absurd option would be : ** - vvd , pvv , cda , 50plus , sgp ( 77 seats ) ** right wing conservative coalition . 
  vvd , cda ~ ~ and 50plus ~ ~ excluded the possibility to govern with the pvv . 
  but if pvv is the largest party , i see ~ ~ both ~ ~ vvd ~ ~ and 50plus ~ ~ flipping their decision ( this is a point of discussion , but i think mark rutte would quit and vvd would go for this with another leader . 
  they will never do this if they 're bigger than the pvv though ) . 
  but it would be suicide for the cda , they had a coalition with vvd and pvv in 2010 and they got decimated the following election . 
  their policy would be right-wing conservative with an emphasis for the eldery . 
  none of these parties really do a lot with environment , and in general they would be very conservative on immigration . 
  both pvv and 50plus have elderly care as a core issue . 
  sgp is super conservative , but are always willing to strike a deal . 
  depending on the actual results , they could ditch the sgp but that 's not the party that is the biggest problem . 
  it 's very unlikely the vvd will go for this construction , and the chances of the cda doing this are close to zero . 
  obviously the formation will be very painful . 
  it 's not outside the real of possibilities that these attempts fail . 
  the first thing that will happen is that an attempt will be made without the vvd . 
  the most likely option then would be a center-left coalition : ** - d66 + gl+cda+sp+p vda ( 79 seats ) ** the first progressive coalition in fourty years . 
  has a majority in both the senate and parliament . 
  there are however a few issues here . 
  the first would be the cda , which is center-right . 
  they do n't really want to be a colourless party that is used to give left a majority . 
  d66 is not really left-wing either , but they are ( in contrast to cda ) very progressive , so the cda is the only conservative party in this coalition . 
  however , if they gain enough on social issues , it 's not impossible . 
  another problem is the sp governing with d66 . 
  the sp is properly left-wing ( still social-democratic , not ` seize the means of production ' socialist ) , eurosceptic and firmly opposed to neo-liberalism , while d66 is pro-eu and very pro-market . 
  the sp is kinda known to be too unwilling to make compromises . 
  however , if they could get enough in particularly healthcare ( their core issue ) can get rid of deductibles in healthcare and signficantly reduce market forces in healthcare , it is certainly a possibility . 
  it would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the sp to present themselves as a serious alternative to the struggling pvda . 
  if they manage to do that , i can see them claiming the role the pvda used to have . 
  if they walk away if this opportunity arrises , they will lose a lot of credibility as a serious alternative . 
  ( on a personal note , will lose me as a potential voter ) ** - d66 + gl+sp+p vda + cu+p vdd ( 70 seats ) ** do n't have a majority in the poll that i use , but do have a majority in another poll that came out before election day . 
  pretty unlikely , but i wanted to include it as it 's my personal favourite . 
  / r/thenetherlands dubbed this coalition as green-i . 
  these are the six most green parties in the parliament , and they would make serious efforts on environmental policy . 
  the biggest hindrance is the d66 that needs to govern with five parties that are all to the left of them . 
  if they do manage to be the biggest , they will deliver the pm and can most likely have a lot of influence though so it is not out of the realm of possibilities . 
  also cu is quite conservative while d66 is very progressive , so that would be difficult as well . 
  again sp/d66 is another issue , which for a lot depends on the willingness of the sp to compromise and be part of the governing coalition . 
  pvdd has the same issues here , they generally have the same attitude as the sp ( ranting against what pvdd calls the ideology of ` compromism ' for example ) and generally vote the same as sp as well . 
  i do n't expect either vvd or cda to make that mistake if pvv is not the largest party . 
  in that case i 'm putting my money on vvd+cda+d 66 + gl . 
  if pvv becomes the largest party though , all bets are off . 
  vvd flipping their position is a guarantee and i 'd say the same is true for 50 + . 
  cda is a possibility but it would be suicide , still i am expecting them to repeat the sham of 2010 and cave in because ` they need to take their responsibilities ' . 
  i 'm just leaving [ this ] ( http://watstemtwilders.nl ) here . 
  was n't fleur agema also in these negotiations ? 
  i remember about some clash with geert wilders and her about cuts on healthcare or something . 
  not germany , but the dutch government just denied him rights to land in this country . 
  i would n't be surprised if germany is next . 
  what ? 
  the netherlands , belgium , ireland ? 
  that 's literally already half of the pot without any connection to polish colonies whatsoever . 
  no , i mean le pen is a hard sell for the left as well . 
   do people live outside of the randstad ? 
  voting for the reincarnation of thatcher ( fillon ) is going to be a really hard sell for the left . 
  not saying he 'd lose , le pen is as well , but i 'm not going to make any assumptions just yet . 
  maybe in the randstad , but we 've plenty of highway that is not lit in the netherlands . 
  what does that have to do with political correctness ? 
  do i need to explain the democratic people 's republic of north korea is n't democratic either ? 
  literally no reputable political scientist would agree with you , the nazis were not fucking socialists . 
  hitler hated socialists , even had them brought to the concentration camps . 
  i 'm specifically referring to aboutaleb ( mayor of rotterdam ) who said that people who get so offended by satirists should just fuck off if they do n't like it . 
  could be translated as get out , but it 's a bit harsher than that . 
  yet somewhat milder than fuck off , maybe get the hell out would be a bitter translation . ) . 
  and jan marijnissen ( former leader socialist party ) who said something like `` to anyone who does n't want to conform to the norms and values we 've created together as a country over our history i 've got this strong advise for you , please go away to a country where you * do * feel at home '' . 
  whether you think their policies are counter-productive to this sentiment is irrelevant . 
  the statement was that it 's controversial to say these things . 
  i just said this is a widely supported sentiment that 's even expressed by some prominent left-wing figures . 
  whatever you think of the policies of these figures is irrelavant to that . 
  former republican chairman is literally house of staff , the attorney-general has 20 years of experience in the senate , his health and human services secretary 13 years in congress , minister of epa nearly a decade in congress and was party whip , secretary of education gop chair in michigan , secretary of transportation had a similar gig under bush , and the director of cia had six years in congress . 
  hardly groundbreaking . 
  especially considering wallstreet executives , also without political experience , are very much part of the political establishment . 
  you really think a wallstreet executive is the kind of person that will actively make wall street pay their fair share of taxes ? 
  the nazis literally persecuted communists/socialists and social democrats . 
  they were socialist only in name . 
  care to explain ? 
  sure , but sanders for example was a typical populist as well . 
  yet i never got that hitler-vibe from him . 
  duh , debts spiked massively all across the board because we had to bail out the banks . 
  not giving a political verdict here about the bail outs . 
  but they explain by far the largest part of the debt spike after 2008 , that 's inevitable if we wanted that sector to survive . 
  very few people disagree with the sentiment itself . 
  even members from left-wing parties said similar things ( both in pvda ( labour ) and the sp ( socialists ) ) . 
  however , the left thinks rutte 's general letter kinda stigmatises the non-western population , the tone itself was quite harsh . 
  and on the right ( well , all across the board actually ) people say it 's all just election retoric . 
  he 's pandering to the pvv voters because those are ahead in the polls . 
  elections are in less than two months . 
  socially conservative as in harsher punishments , no money to culture , critical to multiculturalism etc. . 
  except for the sgp ( 3 out of 150 seats in parliament ) , we do n't really have anti-gay or pro-life parties in the netherlands . 
  that 's a huge exaggeration of course . 
  everybody speaks out against this kind of shit , and it 's a minority who does n't think refugees who commit sexual assault should be sent immediately .
