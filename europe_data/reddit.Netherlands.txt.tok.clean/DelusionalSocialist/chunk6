  in fact , i 've seen people arguing against death penalty * because * it is too easy for hardened criminals . 
  being locked up alone , isolated with no future is a worse punishment than a quick and painless death . 
  tell that to the hordes of student-aged people riding in front of me everyday towards uni  :( but yeah , 15 km/h is ` relaxed cruising speed ' so to speak . 
  if you 're on your way to an appointment 20 km/h is probably more common . 
  but that may be because i 'm always running late . 
  if i 'm randomly cycling towards town without the constraint of time , i often go just 15 km/h . 
  it 's a typical dutch bike , seems to be a pretty nice one actually . 
  they 're not meant to go fast , they 're purely a method to commute in the netherlands . 
  typically people go ~ 15 km/h on their bike in the netherlands . 
  shows how uninformed some people are about culture in europe , speaking of the continent as a monolith . 
  the difference between the netherlands and hungary in regards to culture are * much * stronger than the difference between let 's say california and alabama . 
  you know what , we should start investing in slave labour !, 
  if people are going to make money out of exploiting people anyway , why should n't that be us ? 
  way to move forwards as humanity . 
  i do n't think any dutch person is proud of our fifa ranking right now . 
  we 're literally below iran . 
  we are usually not top three material , but i do think we deserve the ` best team to never win the world cup ' title . 
  there 's not a single other team that lost three world cup finals without winning once . 
  but right now dutch football is in disarray . 
  if i had n't looked at the screenshot , if you told me that we scored below finland these days , i would have actually believed it :(, 
   under a labour government i do n't really see how that is relevant , but it was a coalition of left and right . 
  it seems pretty silly to specifically call the labour party in your comment , especially since the responsible minister of defence , joris voorhoeve , was from the vvd . 
  the right-wing pro-market party . 
  but again , i do n't see how it 's relevant which party was in charge at the time . 
  just saying that it 's silly to pin it on a specific party of the cabinet , especially if it was the other party that delivered the minister that was responsible in this department . 
  i 'm really not a fan of guy verhofdstadt on multiple levels . 
  but that was a pretty cool response , seems like a personal one as well . 
  he gets points for that in my book . 
  lol , i 'm not the one who thinks we can actually charge countries for their refugees . 
  that 's simply now how the world works . 
  now you 're sounding like donald trump who says mexico will pay for his wall . 
  there 's being tough , and there 's reality . 
   this would actually encourage more illegal immigration to the eu . 
   lol how ? 
  do you think this would this have stopped the refugee crisis ? 
  the problem was not just that their respective countries did not want them back , the main problem is that we got way more refugees than we could handle/process . 
  the entire process can take years . 
  only then we get to this point that we sent them back and their native country does not accept them . 
  i 'm happy they will start doing this . 
  but it will not stop the ` mass migration ' from the refugee crisis . 
  it is important to have some pressure though for when we handle with the aftermath . 
  obviously when the region is relatively safe , we should send lots/most of the refugees back . 
  that 's the idea of taking in refugees , to take care of them while their own country is unsafe . 
  at that point we need to apply some pressure to those countries . 
  but your implication that doing this earlier would have stopped the ` two years of mass migration ' is simplistic and wrong . 
  i think you 're right i 'm not that great with non-germanic languages , [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iyjwkif.png ) i found online has it pi\u00f1a in spanish . 
  apparently the english pineapple originated from the spanish word , while most languages adopted ananas instead . 
  most of the world uses ananas though , it 's the english word [ that deviates from the norm . 
  i 'm pretty sure [ english is the one that 's went wrong somewhere ] ( https://i.stack.imgur.com/0wtlv.jpg ) . 
  i 'm not sure if that would work in our favour . 
  maybe i 've got my facts wrong , but i believe we take in more immigrants than finland does . 
  so if we exclude immigration , they 'd beat us even harder . 
  ** edit ** : i 'm wrong . 
  while the netherlands takes slightly more immigrants * in total * than finland ( 110k vs 107k ) , per capita finland is way ahead of us . 
  ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_net_migration_rate ) ) . 
  over a 5-year period of 2007-2012 , we had 6.57 immigrants per 1.000 inhabitants while finland had a whopping 19.84 immigrants per 1.000 inhabitants . 
  and they say the dutch do n't have any culture . 
  lol , what part of percentage do n't you understand ? 
  how hard is it to look at simple numbers ? 
  let me break it down for you , here 's the western-europe countries on the map : belgium - 5.9 % france - 7.5 % ireland - 1.1 % luxembourg - 2.3 % netherlands - 6.0 % % united kingdom - 4.8 % they did not include switzerland , but last data point i found had it at 5.1 % ( [ link ] ( https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/256461.pdf ) ) . 
  i 'm not counting germany as western-europe here . 
  sweden : was at 4.6 % . 
  if we 'd include sweden in this list , it would rank sixth out of eight when it comes to muslim population . 
  yes , that 's one of the lowest in my books . 
  anyway , my point entire point was that the meme that sweden is an islamic country is demonstrably untrue . 
  i simply ca n't take anyone seriously using such fact-free arguments . 
  i never said sweden is some utopia , nor did i say that it is virtually devout of immigrants . 
  all i 'm saying that the ` sweden is an islamic country ' meme is retarded . 
  even if islam population in sweden rose as much since the refugee crisis as you 're suggesting , that point still stands . 
  i think that , in generalized terms , that 's fair to say . 
  you 're wrong , my statement was absolutely true . 
  in fact , i based my data on the same source as you ( pew ) . 
  the difference is that i was actually bothered to look up the actual figures themselves instead of looking at the colours . 
  ( [ source ] ( https://assets.weforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ft_15.01.14_muslimpopulation420px.png ) ), 
  oh absolutely . 
  but that 's still a far cry from the `` swedistan is a hellhole overrun by muslims '' hysteria i see on reddit everyday . 
  but yeah , we should n't dismiss real problems , which are absolutely there , because some people on the internet have a very warped view on this issue . 
  look , there 's nothing wrong with discussing the issues . 
  if people are worried that the rise of migrants lead to an increase in sexual violence , that 's something that should be rightfully discussed . 
  again , there 's nothing wrong with that discussion . 
  in fact , i 'll even say that in the past we did n't have this discussion enough . 
  there 's a very distinct difference between an honest discussion about migration and spouting debunked bullshit to enforce a political agenda . 
  people actually continously state ` sweden is the rape capital of the world ' , call it an islamic country , say it 's a warzone , it has effectively established sharia law etc. . that is why i was specifically stressing that i was talking about the people actively * mocking * the country . 
  not about the people who voice their concerns or want to engage in discussion about this topic . 
  i really have nothing against the latter and even encourage that . 
  but if you 're just perpetuating an old meme about sweden being an islamic country , you 're either a troll or a total idiot . 
  i still stand by that statement . 
   it appears you get to decide who is and who is n't an `` alt-right troll '' . 
  anyone who seriously thinks sweden is the rape capital the world is either an alt-right troll or a total idiot . 
  yes , i fully stand by that statement . 
   has n't it become obvious that sweden * is * doing worse than its counterparts in scandinavia particularly with regard to terribly managed immigration policies and ghettoisation ? 
  seriously we 're living in a fact-free world nowadays . 
  i feel like sweden is doing badly , so it must be true . 
  if you make such bold statements you better brings some facts to the table . 
  either put up or shut up . 
  i 've actually lived in sweden for a while . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a utopia . 
  it has the same problems that many countries have . 
  but this stereotype that some people on the internet have about the county is simply inaccurate . 
  ** edit ** : i do n't have anything against the debate on immigration .
