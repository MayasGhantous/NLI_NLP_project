here are a bunch of papers detailing rosetta , philae , and their instruments . 
  they 've already starting bombing isis . 
  here 's a video explaining what the ess is and does . 
   the yes vote was more like a symbolic gesture . 
  did n't you guys abstain ? 
  here 's a longer article .

  what do tactical nukes ( such as the b61 ) add in terms of deterrence against russia that ca n't be achieved by american strategic nuclear weapons ? 
  because ? 
  here . 
  and an increasingly active jihadi insurgency in xinjiang , heightening tensions between china and several of her neighbours , and renewed clashes between the pakistan government and jihadis in the northwest of the country . 
  the red cross . 
  and all the others . 
  that result was actually caused by a loose cable at cern . 
  http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/02/breaking-news-error-undoes-faster-light-neutrino-results the project leaders have stepped down after the error was discovered . 
  since we 're talking about cyber attacks . 
  nato has updated its cyber defence policy and , for the first time , explicitly stated that cyber attacks are covered by article 5 . http://www.zdnet.com/nato-updates-cyber-defence-policy-as-digital-attacks-become-a-standard-part-of-conflict-7000031064/, 
  50 years . 
  is there a similar map for research - and breeder-reactors ? 
  i will be making a 1-day visit to cologne next friday ( june 20th ) . 
  and perhaps i 'm going to paris for a few days in august . 
  putin even said once that russia could join nato . 
  here 's a really good flash animation showing the war on the eastern front . 
  he speaks at bit more here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awwad-jdwdg, 
  it 's the same with ancient egypt . 
  upper egypt is in the south , lower egypt in the north . 
  i think that this is primarily in china 's benefit . 
  they 've been trying to diversify their energy supply for a while know with pipelines through central asia . 
  the chinese at the moment are dependant on middle eastern oil for a large part of their energy supply , something the us navy can quite easily block that supply at the straight of malacca .

  this is a really good narrative map ( i think that 's the best description ) , showing the ebb-and-flow of the eastern front from a russian perspective . 
  i know , i just edited the tweet . 
  i 'll update when for info becomes available . 
  ~ ~ confirmed by the osce . ~ ~ ~ ~ https://twitter.com/osce/status/462500624706580480~~ the osce has deleted that tweet . 
  not sure why . 
  right now there are 12 planes in the baltics , and some in poland , as part of the current air policing mission . 
  there are also numerous other deployments in eastern europe . 
  the deployment of the f-15c 's ended yesterday . 
  as of today the composition of the air police is 4 mig 29 's from poland , who are leading the mission . 
  4 eurofighters from the uk , who are , like the migs , stationed at siauliai air base in lithuania . 
  there are also 4 danish f-16 's stationed up in estonia and 2 more are on standby back in denmark . 
  there are also [ 4 french rafale 's based in at malbork ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/24/ukraine-crisis-france-idusl6n0ng5wd20140424 ) northern poland , and the us [ stationed 12 f-16 's at lask air base ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/13/us-ukraine-crisis-poland-exercises-idusbrea2c1if20140313 ) for an [ indefinite amount of time . 
  ] ( http://www.stripes.com/news/12-aviano-f-16s-deploying-to-poland-amid-ukraine-crisis-1.272595 ) [ germany has also offered 6 eurofighters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/08/us-ukraine-crisis-nato-idusbrea371wh20140408 ) , which will be sent to the baltics are part of the deployment starting september 1st . 
  portugal will lead that deployment with its f-16 's . 
  both nato and the french air force have deployed awacs planes to eastern europe and the us and the netherlands have sent refuelling plane . 
  edit . 
  there are also 6 cf-18 's from the canadian air force deployed to poland . 
  here 's a neat infographic showing the deployments : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bmgoqa5cuaaaxwz.jpg, 
  the un 's [ international commission of inquiry of libya ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/03/world/africa/united-nations-report-on-libya.html ) did not conclude that nato went beyond the mandate established by resolution 1973 . 
  and if you actually [ read the resolution ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/17/un-security-council-resolution ) , you can see that it prohibits the deployment of an * `` foreign occupation force of any form on any part of libyan territory '' * . 
  i do n't think that a few spotters , trainers , and specops count as an occupation force even by the widest definition . 
  randall monroe made a nice list . 
  the asia-pivot is mostly a us navy affair . 
  over the past few years nearly every destroyer and submarine that has been commissioned has been homeported in san diego and other pacific ports like pearl harbor , and i do n't expect that to end anytime soon . 
  edit . 
  turns out most destroyers are [ homeported in san diego ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arleigh_burke_class_destroyer#ships_in_class ) , not pearl harbor . 
  still , i think that my point stands . 
  the [ main port for submarines ] ( http://navysite.de/submarine.htm ) seems to be pearl harbor . 
  i think these are the original creators of the graphic . 
  i did n't make the infographic , i just found it online . 
  and i think it was created before the naval deployments were announced ( not sure ) . 
  nathan hunt usually has good pictures on his twitter feed . 
  here 's the [ ohchr press release . 
  ] ( http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/media.aspx?ismediapage=true&amp;langid=e ) and here is the [ report . 
  ] ( http://www.ohchr.org/documents/countries/ua/ukraine_report_15april2014.doc ) ( . doc file ), 
  fwiw . 
  the current finnish pm katainen recently stated that ` finland has always kept nato membership open as a option ' and that ` finland is not neutral even though it does not belong to the alliance . ', 
  http://yle.fi/uutiset/katainen_finland_is_not_neutral_nato_is_an_option/7139523 i 'm assuming that most finns , and swedes ( ? 
  ) , still are opposed to nato membership , but what about a mutual defence pact with sweden , or perhaps a baltic alliance ? 
  edit . 
  finnish fm and opposition leader disagreed with the pm 's comments . 
  and there are probably some [ useful idiots ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/useful_idiot ) as well . 
  i have a feeling russia is going to take odessa as well . 
  here 's the original der spiegel article . 
  fox nation , who are even worse . 
  actually they did put up a tremendous fight , and it only became truly hopeless after the ussr joined the war on hitler 's side . 
  and after reading [ the concluding words of a may 1939 speech ] ( http://20committee.com/2014/03/25/honor-and-the-ukraine-crisis/ ) by poland 's then foreign minister , j\u00f3zef beck , it 's not surprising that they fought as hard as they did . 
   peace is a precious and a desirable thing . 
  our generation , bloodied in wars , certainly deserves peace . 
  but peace , like almost all things of this world , has its price , a high but a measurable one . 
  we in poland do not know the concept of peace at any price . 
  there is only one thing in the lives of men , nations and countries that is without price . 
  that is honor . 
  russia considers the 100 - 11 beating they took in the ga to be a victory . 
  they claim it is a sign that the world supports them . 
  russia is claiming this as a victory . 
   '' the result is rather satisfying for us as we have won a moral and a political victory , '' vitaly churkin said . 
   `` it clearly shows that russia is not isolated [ by the international community ] , '' the diplomat said . 
   weakness invites aggression . 
  which is why russia will invade . 
  just look at [ obama 's speech from tuesday . 
  ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/transcript-president-obama-gives-speech-addressing-europe-russia-on-march-26/2014/03/26/07ae80ae-b503-11e3-b899-20667de76985_story.html )  nor will russia be dislodged from crimea or deterred from further escalation by military force . 
  [ * `` simply golden words '' * ] ( https://twitter.com/20committee/status/448938395457585153 ) , for the russians . 
  and [ then there 's this gem ] ( https://twitter.com/statedeptspox/status/448944053741031424 ) from the state dept spokeswomen , posted on an official gov ' t account . 
  i think that you 're going to have to acknowledge that obama is n't taking the crisis seriously and that you 're about to get well and truly fucked !, 
  and given that russia 's statement are [ becoming outrageous even by their low standards . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/rt_russian/status/449195015676624896 ) i think you 're about to get fucked quite soon . 
  i think we can guess what [ yanukovych will saying in his speech tomorrow ... ] ( http://www.unian.net/politics/901229-yanukovich-mojet-v-tretiy-raz-vyistupit-v-rostove-na-donu-smi.html ), 
   the committee said there was `` deep apprehension that moscow may invade eastern and southern ukraine , pressing west to transdniestria ** and also seek land grabs in the baltics . '' ** and here is the house armed services committee letter that the cnn report is based on . 
  now that i 've gotten my names correct ( should have said tha\u00e7i ) , i can .
