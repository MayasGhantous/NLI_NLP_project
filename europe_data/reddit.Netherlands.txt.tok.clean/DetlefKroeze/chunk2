  the [ estimated number of kosovar civilians killed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_war#casualties ) is between 2500 and 10.533 and the number of kosovar refugees was on the order of 850.000 . 
  even though it was n't a genocide as in bosnia ` there had been a `` systematic campaign of terror , including murders , rapes , arsons and severe maltreatments '' . ', 
  and : ` the exactions committed by milosevic 's regime can not be qualified as criminal acts of genocide , since their purpose was not the destruction of the albanian ethnic group ... [ but its forceful departure from kosovo '' .

  what 's the probability of a federalised baltic state ? 
  he also tweeted it in english . 
  it 's not , the referred to pravda is an online news site .

  with regards to the baltic air policing mission , most of the time it is a european nato member whose air force is on duty . 
  but i 'd love to see diversified/extended to more european nato countries , and perhaps even make it a joint eu-nato responsibility . 
  edit . 
  but i do doubt that if it were a european member currently on patrol that it would also have increased their commitment . 
   the us currently provides four f-15s to fill nato 's [ baltic air policing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_air_policing ) rotation . 
  `` this week , the united states will send six additional f-15s and one kc-135 to augment the mission , '' the official said .

   a pentagon official told cbs news that the u.s. detected the launch of the russian icbm near the border of russia and kazakhstan . 
  notifications were made ahead of time in accordance with normal procedures . 
  the official said the launch is viewed as non-threatening and is not connected to what is going on in crimea . 
  they already have [ 128 of those ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_equipment_of_the_polish_land_forces ) , and have ordered 119 more .

  when russia invaded georgia back in 2008 the georgians we 're all gung ho at the first sign of russian troops on their soil , thereby giving the russians a pretext to invade with much larger numbers . 
  the ukrainians are trying to avoid making to same mistake . 
  cnn did something similar once by misplacing iraq . 
  ukraine has ordered full mobilization of ukaines armed forces to start at 8 am http://censor.net.ua/news/273621/v_ukraine_nachinaetsya_mobilizatsiya,

  nato allies will continue to support ukrainian sovereignty and independence , territorial integrity , democratic development , economic prosperity and its status as a non-nuclear weapon state , and the principle of inviolability of frontiers , as key factors of stability and security in central and eastern europe and in the continent as a whole . 
  nato and ukraine will develop a crisis consultative mechanism to consult together whenever ukraine perceives a direct threat to its territorial integrity , political independence , or security . 
  nato welcomes and supports the fact that ukraine received security assurances from all five nuclear-weapon states parties to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons ( npt ) as a non-nuclear weapon state party to the npt , and recalls the commitments undertaken by the united states and the united kingdom , together with russia , and by france unilaterally , which took the historic decision in budapest in 1994 to provide ukraine with security assurances as a non-nuclear weapon state party to the npt .

  i do n't know . 
  a possible option could be the european court of human rights but i do n't know anything about the workings of that court or even if they have the jurisdiction to take on cases of this nature . 
  it happens [ quite a lot actually ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_criminal_court_investigations ) , most of the investigations were started after the country involved referred the situation to the icc . 
  but this is the first time it happened to a non-african nation , so that 's a major victory for the court . 
  actually the taliban was founded only in 1994 , consisting mainly of young boys from madrassas who were too young to have fought in the war against the soviets . 
  also , as / u/atomickoala said , they were most likely ` pakistani backed stooges . 
  and they were never the good guys , and were hardly recognized even when they were in power .

  here 's a similar thread ( with a more restrictive question ) that 's fun to read through . 
  us troops were initially welcomed by the iraqi population , especially by the shia in the south , the ma ` dan ( marsh arabs ) , and the kurds . 
  no , it almost certainly has n't .

  youssef described how , one night , he and his fellow prisoners smelled what they thought was burning plastic . 
  the next day , when they asked a staff member about the odor , youssef said , `` we were told azrael melted a plastic bucket over someone 's head until [ he ] burned to death . '' and the idea that dictators keep their countries stable is [ bullshit of the highest order .

  yes . 
  ejsm-laplace has been cancelled . 
  now it 's just juice , which can be viewed as the successor to laplace , and europa clipper , which is the first europa mission to proceed to phase a , and to get an official nod from nasa . 
  all the previous missions we 're glorified cocktail napkin sketches . 
   there has been usa-russian reset recently , and look how it ended . 
  the reset worked just fine , it 's just that some bastard set the button to 1983 .

  no , not really . 
  a chinese pilot once managed to get within 0 meters of an american ep-3e aries ii . 
  he died . 
  the way it is now means a russian victory in two days and the probable fracturing of nato . 
  here 's an overview of upcoming esa missions that i wrote several months ago . 
  estonia has a clear plan for dealing with any `` little green men '' -- the undercover russian special forces operatives who sprung up in the early days of the ukraine crisis last year -- according to the country 's chief of defence : they will be shot . 
  as nato powers digest the kremlin 's newfound revanchism , the baltic region has emerged as an area of particular concern for the alliance -- and a potential next-target for russian militarism and subversive military tactics .
