germany . 
  historical allies . 
  used to protect us from the brits and french untill wwi . 
  lots of similarities between the countries . 
  i have a windows 8 installation for gaming , and use debian 7 for everything else . 
  nothing too bad . 
  frisians think the goverment looks too much at the randstad , and forgets about the rest of the country , ( which tbh , is true ) . 
  [ amelanders ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ameland ) still think they are a pirate stronghold . 
  that can only end well ... 
  i do n't really see the problem ... 
  looks like the usa will be liberating sweden soon . 
  derby blades are fucking terrible . 
  sorry man . 
  food is good , the people ( atleast here in the netherlands ) are not too bad . 
  not sure how desperate you have to be to eat a kebab . 
  [ we are , it 's how we kicked the french and british armies \\ ( at the time only slightly less feared than the prussian army \\ ) out . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hollandic_water_line ), 
  pff . 
  republicans . 
   but the hague is the capital right ? 
  yes it fucking is . 
  amsterdam is where we send unwashed tourists :p, 
  how about fuck no . 
  gouda oud belegen , and certain raw milk cheeses like emmentaler, 
  what ? 
  the kingdom of the netherlands , or the netherlands itself ? 
  damn it , do educate me please . 
  just throw it on the pile . 
  they can also throw their 8000 goverments on the pile with ours . 
   of everyone that can only speak one language , roughly 65 % are located in the uk . 
  god damn it brits , get on a proper level . 
  heretic !, 
  hey , wan na be restored in the kingdom of the netherlands ? 
  3 years ago , on my 18th birthday , my mother gave me a ring with the swastika on it . 
  ( i come from a hindu familly from suriname , we all have this ring , and i refuse to take it off except for safety reasons ) . 
  people are generally confused when they see it . 
  untill now , only a single person ( a jew , go figure ) did n't need more explanation when i said i 'm a hindu . 
  they are slightly better brits . 
  well , this does set up the world for a good kebab purging . 
  looks like basic politics to me . 
  the netherlands ; belgium ; the little brother that left us because our father was an idiot . 
  germany ; the big brother that used to protect us from france until democracy happened . 
  luxembourg ; cousin that is not in personal union anymore because of the salian law . 
  suriname ; they did not want to leave the family , but were kicked out on the curb because america . 
  i for one heil georg friedrich . 
  yes , and we still have more than enough cells left over : /, 
  is that including the 6 million variations on the name . 
  you have ceased the removal of kebab ? 
  pff . 
  because unlike certain countries we actually care about international law . 
  atleast we trust you bastards not to fuck up . 
  that would just be off the scale . 
  god damn it germany . 
  i love you glorious bastards /, 
  the dutch and the germans ( well , atleast the prussians ) were forever allies untill wwi . 
  we love you . . 
  neither do we . 
  prussia was pretty damn scary ... 
  they had a nice country too from what i heard, 
  well , there were these crusades that you won . 
  then again , they did invade in the winter . 
  you 'd think people would not make that mistake again ... 
  alright . 
  have fun . 
  the byzantine empire ( east roman ) was the continuation of the roman empire . 
  the hre had no claim at all :p, 
  you know what the uk needs ? 
  another dutch king like willem iii . 
  european union is a perfectly good name . 
  we 'd be on 4.0 . 
  roman republic . 
  roman empire byzantine empire/rhomaion . 
  because you know . 
  brussels . 
  invade turkey  rename istanbull back to constantinople or byzantion  restore the rhomaion  laugh as the vatican gets kicked down to second ( third ? ), 
  most important city of christianity again . 
   i 'm a little ashamed of geenstijl , last i checked they were a satire website ... did that change ? 
  diets  iberia . 
  abolishing , or going to a full blast monarchy requires a change in the dutch constitution , which would require ; * 75 % vote in the tweede kamer ( parliament ) * 75 % vote in the eerste kamer ( senate ) * referendum requiring 75 % of the votes cast to be in favour . 
  generally , i do n't see abolishment happening , as the royal family is quite popular . 
  a funny thing is that it would actually remove us from the eu , as it 's not the netherlands that is a member , but the [ kingdom of the netherlands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_netherlands#countries ) . 
   . . it 's like smoking weed in amsterdam which is not legal . 
  an universe ruled by the brits would ensure the final victory of grandfather nurgle . 
  that makes me kinda giggle . 
  where was that from ? 
  there are still [ hohenzollerns ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georg_friedrich,_prince_of_prussia ) too . 
  well , our new emperor has been chosen http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_habsburg-lothringen, 
   conservative party  for a real change . 
  might as well go for heel-nederland while we 're at it . 
  does this mean the southern netherlands will rejoin the netherlands ? 
  obviously , it should be either [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/familienwappen_habsburg-stroehl.jpg/467px-familienwappen_habsburg-stroehl.jpg ) , or [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/wappen_deutsches_reich_-_reichswappen_%28grosses%29.svg ) . 
  officially it 's illegal ... 
  the goverment just does n't care enough about private use to actually add a penalty to it . 
  they used to be part of the kingdom , so they can make some kind of claim on it . 
  ** casus belli ; reclaim the flag **, 
  we want our god damn flag back . 
  21 , fulltime student , with a job in the evenings . 
  still live with my parents for now , and the general housing market is ... not completely terrible . 
  tyranny of the masses would be the worst form of goverment ever . 
  for the rhoma\u00ed\u014dn,
