  the french flag ; the original flag of the dutch republic turned on it 's side . 
  their sorry excuse of a language . 
  wait ... . 
  wow , i had a brainfart there ... 
  i misread that in the worst possible way ... 
  ~ ~ the dutch-indonesians are mostly part of the rms goverment in exile , and it 's always nice to see them on 25th of april . ~ ~ ~ ~ also the only day the satudarah is cheered on , which is interesting ... ~ ~ brainfart . 
  * runs to bolster the gates of wien *, 
  which one ? 
  that the fireworks factory had cluster munitions in storage ? 
  germany and denmark . 
  i mean sure , if we make enough effort we can get the gist of eachothers language , but still . 
  woah there mate . 
  we 're circlejerking here . 
  please fall in line . 
  damn it germany , stop beating us with this record low ( -0.25 % for dutch bonds ), 
  well , if all you get are american style games instead of german style games , yeah ... 
  with oranje to victory !, 
  cripes . 
  if you leave your shit on the beach here it 's just going to get pissed on overnight . 
  oh god , i know i 've been over to the deep end when my mind automatically fills in the voice ... 
  i 'm half convinced this is a way to avoid paying taxes . 
  got the spanjards all hot and ready to purge the muslims again . 
  too bad it was only a group of incompetent brits ... 
  youth wings for political parties are n't that rare . 
  vice-chairman of the eerste kamer ? 
  stars on a flag ? 
  god damn commies . 
  https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/lelydorp they knew what it would become and named it appropriately, 
  time for some reverse-flevoland, 
  god damn it , those are not supposed to be vtols !, 
  it 's nothing personal , every so often we just have to remind the people that while the brits rule the waves , we rule the seas . 
  `` when putin was the prime-minister the prime-minister ran the country , when putin was president the president ran the country '', 
  `` do n't worry , we 'll drain it when we can be bothered '' - netherlands, 
  wait , did you just describe the frogs or the island hobos ? 
  light pollution capital of the world . 
  it 's not our fault we have taste ... 
  i know right . 
  we 're rewarding people for being weak instead of rewarding the strong . 
  this is an outrage that should be fixed as soon as possible . 
  very few people do considering the only part that is really relevant to the masses is the personal information . 
  the rest is just for customs or other things like that, 
  easy there island frog . 
  we all know your little island nation was worthless untill a dutch man became king and made it a major power, 
  was that the one where we all agreed that letting frogs and island frogs make maps/draw borders was a bad idea ? 
  old amsterdam is the gift of the gods, 
   and i might have rare , old books in german just about him ... you my friend , are making my history boner interested . 
   prinz eugen marsch * checks flair . 
  * * nods * seriously though , great piece . 
  [ mars der medici ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm7mctjxznq ) ( march of the medics ) pretty soothing as far as millitary marches go . 
  [ huzarenmars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejrkwjj2vmc ) ( hussars march ) [ bonus from the germans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqanhmx-nvu ), 
  [ been there , done that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_of_the_netherlands ), 
  the official aruban version ; http://www.arubaforeignaffairs.com/afa/readblob.do?id=704, 
  [ polder model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polder_model ), 
  the part where they apparantly ca n't tell poland and holland apart . 
  what ? 
  how are people that ... well ... 
  i do n't even know what to call it ... 
  huh ? 
  he only wants the inner six ? 
   belgium 's staying together out of pure spite against other nations . 
  i mean , should there be any other reason ? 
  it 's as good as any . 
   for the dutch , it would be insane to switch to any currency not used in germany . 
   even if we did , it would be pegged to whatever they have , just like the guilder was pegged to the mark . 
  if the dutch have to become the new sugardaddy of france we 'd be right the fuck out of there . 
  we ca n't handle that on our own . 
  really though , there have also been people saying we should return to our own currency . 
  we are also one of the few countries ( that admitted ) to have a contingency plan for such an event . 
  we had not yet forgotten him , and had to make sure he stayed down this time . 
  yup , if you can endure vice ( i 'll understand if you ca n't ) , they did a few vids on it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awqdloonkdi, 
  prussia help , the french are looking at us again !, 
  ca n't blame the mexicans for wanting to go back to northern mexico . 
  it 's hardly an exception . 
  democracies are generally mob/populist rule, 
  so the multi-billion surcharges we paid to the eu were to grease palms right ? 
  atleast it 's not sch\u00e4uble, 
  i 'd buy one . 
  or two . 
  japan did . 
  there just is a very vocal group of ultra nationalists that refuse to . 
  they did n't want to go full-brit or full-dutch . 
  they just went half-french, 
  please never link to the ad again . 
  we do n't like bad dictators . 
  a dictatorship in itself is not inherently bad . 
  yup . 
  the treaty of utrecht was spain officially giving up on the lowlands . 
  ( de-facto they had already done so before ), 
  it is how we know the difference between the dutch and all others . 
  we only know the first stanza of our own . 
  if you know more you 're hiding something . 
  ^ ^ well ^ ^ i ^ ^ know ^ ^ all ^ ^ of ^ ^ it ... 
  but french is only important in england ... 
  well , i 'm only half joking . 
  rutte gets into a car ( coalition ) with others , but when the car crashes he 's the only one that walks out without even a scar . 
  that smirk of his never leaves his face because nothing sticks to him . 
  should have let our prime minister do the negotiation . 
  rutte would most likely have walked out of the building on day one with greece as a grand duchy of the kingdom . 
  it 's already moved to switzerland . 
  roemer in a nutshell .
