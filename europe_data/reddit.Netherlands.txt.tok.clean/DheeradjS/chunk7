  one nation , under the twin crowns of oranje-nassau and hohenzollern . 
  no upport for the hohenzollern ? 
  but muh sovereignty / s, 
  better not send him abroad , or serbia will cause a world war again . 
  well , maybe protest is n't the right word . 
  maybe manifestation . 
  usually small stuff like `` stay in area xyz , and we wo n't give a shit '' , or `` do n't block the rails , because trains take a long time to stop , and the people inside might get hurt . '', 
  officially it 's forbidden to offend the monarch . 
  this law is effectively not enforced , as the freedom of speech from the constitution thrumps it . 
  ( unless you make a rape threat , because then we like jam this law all over you . ), 
  http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ecli:nl:rbams:2007:bb1044 we can generally make fun of the royals all we like . 
  republicans like to break the terms of their protests , and then claim they get arrested because of this law . 
  thanks to privatization the rail infrastructure had to be sold by the goverment . 
  while it 's still good , it 's becoming worse . 
  louis bonaparte was indeed a good man . 
  i was refering to emperor napoleon . 
  it 's too bad napoleon got rid of him in 1810, 
  we got rid of them before , we shall do it again !, 
  after willem iii turned the country into a major power there was no reason for us to ever go there again . 
  my grandfather lived on the other side of the kingdom : u, 
  germany . 
  we might as well be part of it anyway . 
  the problem is n't the meat , the problem is that was ( intentionally ) labeled incorrectly . 
  9 out of 10 times they get arrested for taking their protests out of their designated areas . 
  whoops . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salic_patrimony they did n't feel the need to rename it . 
  it 's not bad . 
  initially written in 1999 , it was only officially translated in 2010 . 
  both the original and the translation were released without the help of an editor , so at times you might raise your eyebrows . 
  on the other hand , it 's free . 
  mongrel language ? 
  wow , the corrent term for that is peasant language . 
  currently reading * the last ringbearer . 
  * it 's an alt-story set in the lord of the rings universe . 
  attempts to present mordor 's perspective of the war , i.e. , that feudal-fundamentalists turned back the clock of history by destroying a progressive industrial state . 
  * democracy : the god that failed * , * the alexiad * , and * the chronographia * are next . 
  i 'd support it , ** but ** . 
  considering the current state of the eu , i doubt it 'll work . 
  the north/south division is simply too big . 
  a `` north european '' state in the form of germany , austria , the benelux countries , the nordic countries , and maybe the uk ** might ** work , but the question there will remain how well it 'll function . 
  assault rifles ? 
  pff , not even a real man . 
  you joke , but certain groups actually proposed an arranged marriage between those two ... 
  either way , the united kingdom of the netherlands/the lowlands shal rise again ( it already kinda did through the three crowns of the benelux ), 
  considering most of us do n't even want him as prime minister ... 
  basic german is taught in highschool , but only around the border will you find really fluent people . 
   belgium joined france what heresy is this ? 
  sorry , the usa has laws that mandate an invasion if we prosecute a usa citizen . 
  we 'll simply dump you in the sea . 
   the most anti-german sentiments are among the dutch huh ? 
  is it 1970 again ? 
   the dutch being `` van duitse bloed '' ( from german blood ) , you might quickly get the silent treatment . 
  if they dropped out of high school maybe . 
  everybody else can tell you the actual meaning of the phrase . 
  nope , everybody forgot the water boards exist apparantly . 
  of course , ca n't have a stadthouder without a raadpensionaris . 
  the plebians need somebody to lynch after they mess up afterall !, 
  democracy is inefficient . 
  in these times we should just go back to the stadthouders !, 
  : popcorn :, 
  throwing rocks at emergency personel ( medics etc. ) ? 
  i 'm sure nobody will object to such people being purged . 
  `` peaceful '', 
  horse meat is pretty damn good actually . 
   you guys used to hate us during ww1 during ww2 ww2 , yes . 
  in ww1 the dutch were pretty pro-german/anti-brit, 
  we like germans . 
  ~ ~ even ~ ~ except while playing football . 
  not their parents specifically . 
  vladimir ii would be the second vladimir to rule a country/head a dynasty i believe the greeks actually continued counting from the byzantine emperors for their kings, 
  `` i got paid in rubbles , and i did n't finish converting it before it crashed '', 
  british food is terrible , that is why they got such a huge empire . 
  they went out to find better food . 
  food needs to be functional . 
  ( part of ) the 11 luchtmobiel brigade is already ( somewhat ) intergrated in the bundeswehr through the division schnelle kr\u00e4fte . 
  hey now , hamburgers are acceptable german food . 
  god damn it serbia , do n't be the only country in the world to cause two world wars . 
  ^ ^ no ^ ^ hate , ^ ^ just ^ ^ a ^ ^ little ^ ^ joke ... 
  hey man , food needs to be healthy and filling . 
  taste is secondary . 
  at the height of the crisis the netherlands made a contingency plan ( florijn ) in case the euro would completly crash and burn . 
  it was kept completely secret until it was revealed last november . 
  https://euobserver.com/news/126605 that is the only article i could find in english , and there were rumours that the germans had a similar emergency plan , or even a joint dutch-german plan to quickly switch currencies . 
  no doubt other countries had similar plans for a worst-case scenario . 
  by order of his majesty , only dutch people are allowed to make such jokes about antillians . 
  by the same orders only antillians are allowed to be racist against the dutch . 
  we are afraid of heights . 
  just allow us to hide behind the dykes . 
  we would offer it to the belgians but we 'd rather the people there keep their hands . 
  feel like putting part of your navy under the command of the admiral dietsland ? 
  sure , it 's called the admiral benelux now , but we can always change the name . 
  thank you dear sir/madam . 
  huh ? 
  it 's a napoleon joke . 
  well , we have about 20 planes that are used for spare parts . 
  you can come over and see if anything catches your fancy . 
  yup . 
  they had that sign in 1939 . 
  that 's why they were sent out of the country . 
  we might have made a mistake in not reforming the language like the germans did .
