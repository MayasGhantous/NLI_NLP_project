there is quite a difference , but the map does n't seem entirely accurate when it comes to spain . 
  support does seem higher , but 83 % doesnt seem to be supported by the [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_europe#public_opinion_around_europe ) , even if you consider that the image counts `` do n't know/neutral/no answer '' as support . 
  [ this image ] ( http://themonkeycage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gaymarriage.jpg ) shows results from a single poll . 
  why is `` do n't know/neutral/no answer '' counted as yes/support ? 
   i do n't know how you justify translating `` inlijven '' as annexation . 
  has the eu annexed everything since the ecsc ? 
  has nato annexed everything east of berlin ? 
  no , and you should n't use inlijven in any of those circumstances either . 
  you can [ check ] ( https://nl.wiktionary.org/wiki/inlijven ) [ these ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/inlijving ) [ dictionaries ] ( http://www.woorden.org/woord/inlijven ) to verify that annex is in fact a synonym and that `` inlijven '' is in fact often used when one party is n't a willingly part of the proceeding . 
  you accuse me of using loaded language but you do n't seem to notice that the video does exactly that . 
  referring to a trade agreement between 2 willing parties as an attempt of `` inlijving '' is just way over the top . 
  `` inlijven '' and `` annexeren '' are considered synonymous when talking about countries . 
  and inlijven most often has an implication of force even when not talking about countries , so i do n't think translating it as annex is ` grossly mistranslated ' . 
  the creators of the video are the ones that chose to use an ` aggressive ' word like that to describe the eu seeking a trade agreement . 
  the video does n't even explain what the treaty is about . 
  it 's a series of vague accusations against the eu and ukraine . 
  i 'm kinda thankful that even after fighting a world war countries like the usa chose to help rebuild the netherlands instead of only caring about their own shit . 
  the people in favor of this do n't understand geopolitics . 
  do n't blame them to much , they mostly want this referendum to make a statement against the eu . 
  they chose ukraine because of the current instability and they spread misinformation about it . 
  you can check their [ their promotion video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lalqmaweo5u&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=45s ) to see for yourself . 
  i 'll do some translation . 
  it says stuff like : * `` the agreements caused violent protest on the maidan square '' ( note how the picture is from a moscow protest ) * `` the government fled and nazis took over seats in parliament '' * `` mh17 got shot out of the air , allegedly by pro-russian rebels , however that is still not clear ... what exactly is taking place between the eu and ukraine ??? '', 
  * `` in the case of ukraine , but also georgia and moldavia , the eu is crawling towards the russian border . 
  all 3 countries once belonged to the soviet-union , and now the eu and nato are trying to annex those countries '' * `` president putin is not happy about these proceedings on his doormat , even more importantly putin has the opinion that russia has the right to territory in all 3 countries '' * `` a civil war is still ongoing . 
  most of the interests are gas and oil but it 's also a game of land-theft with military shows of power between crashing ideologies '' * `` it 's a geographical bee hive , and there 's little honey to be gained '' i wish i was joking with this one :( * `` all 3 countries are poor oligarchies with failing political systems and bankrupt economies that will need monetary support '' . 
  the agreement has been ratified by so many democratically elected governments , yet people keep complaining about things being `` undemocratic '' . 
  just look at [ this list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement#ratification ) , what more do you want ? 
  the international community does n't care about the dutch sentiment against the eu . 
  they will see this as a statement against ukraine . 
  it should be noted that the vast majority of the signatures came from an online form and that the referendum was presented to people as a statement against the eu rather than a statement against the agreement or against ukraine . 
  this , alongside the fact that the dutch government has already ratified the agreement means that there 's likely going no consequences for the agreement itself . 
  they wo n't . 
  even the result of the referendum is 100 % non-binding . 
  and since the dutch government has already signed the agreement there 's not much they could do anyway . 
  less than 25 % of representatives voted against it , none of whom are part of the government so i doubt they even want to take action . 
  it 's a referendum that [ would be held next year ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2059595-referendum-over-oekraine-mogelijk-in-voorjaar.html ) and is non-binding . 
  the dutch government has already signed the agreement and has no obligation to block it . 
  especially since even the sites organizing it have made clear trough their campaigning that this referendum is meant as a sign against the eu as a whole . 
  chances of this affecting anything other than pro-russian propaganda are slim . 
  you keep claiming that i said the issue was exclusively islamic , but that was another poster . 
  the claim i made in the first post was `` if there 's a stream of sub-section of islam that uses religion to defend or promote fgm it 's warranted and i 'd argue even necessary to criticize them . '' . 
   `` religious leaders promote fgm '' . 
  they do . 
  there 's also many islamic scholars that disagree with them . 
  so you can conclude that islam as a whole does n't require fgm , but you can still criticize the scholars that do support it . 
  that 's a fair conclusion , yes . 
  if you read the [ wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_female_genital_mutilation_by_country#south.2c_southeast_and_central_asia ) you 'll find that islamic scholars in those countries tend to support fgm as well . 
  by regions i meant geographical location . 
  indonesia and malaysia are part of south-east asia , so fgm does n't just happen in africa and the middle east as most people think and the op kind of implied . 
   yes , it does . 
  if other religions do it , then it 's not or no longer a muslim practice . 
  this is arguing about semantics , but i 'd say that for example praying is a muslim tradition even if other religions practice it . 
   it 's just not a religious issue . 
  the absence of islam does not stop circumcision , nor does the presence of islam guarantee circumcision . 
  neither is relevant . 
  when a group of people who practice fgm claim to do so for religious reasons and religious leaders promote fgm you can conclude it is in fact a religious issue . 
   it 's much easier to convince people they 're still good muslims without sending their children to the butcher for a cut , than to convert them entirely . 
  so what do you want : stop fgm or just rant impotently against the evil islamists ? 
  i never claimed islam mandated fgm , just that there 's a section of islam supporting and even promoting the practice . 
  islamic groups do n't have to promote fgm just like catholic groups do n't have to oppose gay marriage and condoms , but when they do criticism is warranted . 
  sharing statistics and countering misinformation is hardly what i would classify as an `` impotent rant '' . 
  the south-east asian countries tend to have more stable governments that already try to discourage the worst forms of fgm . 
  so in a way it does n't have the same urgency for the western world . 
  it also happens in tanzania or liberia , where christianity or indigenous religions dominate . 
   furthermore , there are plenty of muslim countries where it does n't happen at all . 
  so it 's like saying that male circumcision is christian tradition , just because it happens often in the usa . 
  first of all , the fact that it happens in those countries does not disprove his claim . 
  also , it 's wrong to imply you ca n't criticize a religion unless every stream and version of it agrees on the matter . 
  if there 's a stream of sub-section of islam that uses religion to defend or promote fgm it 's warranted and i 'd argue even necessary to criticize them . 
  let me give you 3 examples from non-african countries : * the highest islamic clerical organisation in indonesia ruled that it favors fgm , stating that although it is not mandatory , it is still `` morally recommended '' . 
  fmg prevalence in indonesia is at 85 % . 
  * the government sponsored conference of malaysia 's council of islamic religious affairs decided that female circumcision is part of islamic teachings and it should be observed by muslims , with the majority of the jurists in the committee concluding that female circumcision is obligatory ( wajib ) . 
  in malaysia 93 % of females in muslim families have been mutilated . 
  * even in smaller places like the isolated island group the maldives fgm is a problem . 
  the practice of female circumcision is reviving there because of [ islamic fatwas ] ( http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/28292 ) from religious scholars who preach that it as compulsory . 
  by the way , fgm in liberia ca n't be attributed to any group yet due to secrecy and taboo regarding the subject . 
  the rural areas and it 's tribes are very often muslim . 
  the christians in liberia are often made up of or influenced by immigrants who moved there after slavery was abolished in the usa , so it 's not a certainty that that fmg is practiced by them . 
   if one were to perform a very professional research , such as checking a fucking wikipedia article , he or she would know that it is almost exclusively african problem that affects muslims and christians alike . 
  if you would actually look at the wikipedia section called '' [ fgm prevalence by country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_female_genital_mutilation_by_country#south.2c_southeast_and_central_asia ) '' instead of the image showing only africa you would see that your statement is completely incorrect . 
  for example 97.5 % of females from muslim families in indonesia and at least 85 % of the total females in indonesia are mutilated by age 18 . 
  it is prevalent in malaysia as well , where 93 % of females from muslim families and at least 57 % of the total female population have been mutilated . 
   fgm is a widespread practice in africa and middle east . 
  religion has little to do with how common it is , it is part of the underlying older culture . 
  however there 's no denying that since it is connected to female chastity and purity , islam embraced it particularly well . 
  it 's almost never mentioned in western media and after i stumbled upon in it a few years back it left me speechless . 
  it 's not restricted to those regions i 'm afraid . 
  for example 97.5 % of females from muslim families in indonesia and at least 85 % of the total females in indonesia are mutilated by age 18 . 
  it is prevalent in malaysia as well , where 93 % of females from muslim families and at least 57 % of the total female population have been mutilated . 
  the 2nd link did mention the usa will even up that to 100k in 2017 , so i did n't mean to imply that the us does n't do anything in general . 
  just that there ought to be more options for syrian refugees . 
  and brazil manages to take in 6000 , so the atlantic ocean does n't exactly excuse things . 
  thanks , i keep messing that one up . 
  i never said it 's evil to interfere in a conflict . 
  supporting syrian rebels might have even been the right choice . 
  but if you interfere , you then also have to take responsibility for and be involved with the fallout . 
  yes , the usa was not the only country that supported the rebels , my point was that they are currently taking in way less than even countries that had little influence in the conflict . 
  latino immigrants are more comparable to europe 's millions of guest workers and immigrants from eastern europe . 
  edit : which does not imply that either group are purely economic migrants .
