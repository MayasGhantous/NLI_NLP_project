  just for clarity . 
  the usa has taken in between [ 1000 ] ( http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121935/why-hasnt-america-admitted-more-syrian-refugees ) to [ 1500 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/world/europe/us-to-increase-admission-of-refugees-to-100000-in-2017-kerry-says.html?_r=0 ) syrian refugees . 
  that 's less than countries like brazil , belgium and switzerland . 
  the netherlands took in more syrian refugees in less than 2 months than the entire united states did in over four years . 
  considering the usa 's trackrecord of interfering with the middle east and its programs to support and arm syrian rebels , i 'd say a general request for help is rather polite . 
  this website organizing it is very far apart from the left . 
  if you really want to assign them a corner they are closest to right wing or libertarian populists . 
  since the other dutch people seem to be promoting the referendum and not giving you a fair answer , i 'm just gon na link you [ their promotion video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lalqmaweo5u&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=45s ) and do some translation . 
  it says stuff like * `` the agreements caused violent protest on the maidan square '' ( note how the picture is from a moscow protest ) * `` the government fled and nazis took over seats in parliament '' * `` mh17 got shot out of the air , allegedly by pro-russian rebels , however that is still not clear ... what exactly is taking place between the eu and ukraine ??? '', 
  * `` in the case of ukraine , but also georgia and moldavia , the eu is crawling towards the russian border . 
  all 3 countries once belonged to the soviet-union , and now the eu and nato are trying to annex those countries '' * `` president putin is not happy about these proceedings on his doormat , even more importantly putin has the opinion that russia has the right to territory in all 3 countries '' * `` a civil war is still ongoing . 
  most of the interests are gas and oil but it 's also a game of land-theft with military shows of power between crashing ideologies '' * `` it 's a geographical bee hive , and there 's little honey to be gained '' i wish i was joking with this one :( * `` all 3 countries are poor oligarchies with failing political systems and bankrupt economies that will need monetary support '' . 
  hopefully you 'll understand that the people who want this are a minority who ca n't even get 2 % of the dutch population to sign a form on the internet . 
  most of them are only interested in voting against the eu and do n't notice the manipulation either . 
  anyway , i guess this thread is getting brigaded by them or something as the threads in / r/thenetherlands are usually critical or downright dismissive about the initiative . 
  well yeah , moroccan people would n't be the ones coming from a war . 
  that part of the refugees applies more to people from iraq , afghanistan and syria . 
  they do n't need good dutch . 
  polish workers often have job skills that connect much better to the dutch job market demands ( e.g. 
  home improvement ) and often migrate specially for the work . 
  the european setup also allows for structures where polish people are underpaid , making them more attractive for unskilled labour than fully naturalized immigrants . 
  using the same source ( central bureau of statistics ) i found [ this article ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/arbeid-sociale-zekerheid/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2015/langdurige-werkloosheid-neemt-toe-en-treft-vooral-45-plussers.htm ) . 
  it provides a few graphs showing people are on welfare for longer amounts of time nowadays . 
  the part about non-western foreigners is in text so i 'll summarize that part : non-western foreigners ( meaning people whose parents are n't born in the netherlands ) amount to a quarter of the long term unemployed . 
  they are also more likely to have long term basic welfare . 
  non-western foreigners that had a job previously and lost it leave the national workers insurance quicker , though that could also be due to their shorter job history entitling them to a shorter time of benefits from said insurance . 
  it 's pretty valid . 
  the research also gave reasons for the difficulties in finding work , though they seem quite obvious . 
  many of the people struggling to find work do n't have a good grasp of the dutch language and have no education or have one that does n't connect well to dutch demands . 
  there 's also refugees who suffer from war trauma . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/dossiers/allochtonen/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2015/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand.htm ) is the original resource from the central bureau of statistics . 
  there 's an [ english section ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/home/default.htm ) of the site , but this article was n't translated . 
  there 's some other interesting stuff though . 
  like the [ table with asylum requests ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slen&amp;pa=81478eng&amp;d1=a&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=0-1,9,11,14-15,18,23,28-29,31,34,36,l&amp;d5=67,84,101,118,135,140-142,l&amp;la=en&amp;vw=t ) showing that until recently there were more people coming from eritrea than there 's people coming from syria . 
  you do know that the point of the quota is to relocate refugees from countries like ~ ~ spain ~ ~ , italy and greece , right ? 
  seems kind of weird that you would laugh and talk shit about a solution to your problem . 
  plenty of countries receive more than they pay . 
  the legal possibility is not there at all . 
  several treaties prevent things like sending people to dangerous countries , sending back children , having no appeals process , depriving people of secondary needs and sending people back to a country without consent of said country . 
  that 's not what the article says at all . 
  the article talks about the government wanting a long term solution and mentions that for the short term they are in favour of the redistribution plan and are willing to accept refugees . 
  the government specifically stated that their goal with letting refugees apply in countries like turkey , is to avoid human trafficking across the mediterranean sea and eastern europe . 
  it 's not that easy . 
  if a refugee claims to be from a persecuted group the environment would still be considered hostile despite relative peace in their home country . 
  the country they are from can also simply refuse to take them in or the refugee could just refuse to leave and enter years worth of legal processes . 
  most likely the refugees would point to the fact that they have lived in their new country for years and that they and more importantly their children are now rooted in the new country with local friends , work and education . 
  you ca n't force them back , and after living a few years in the west with full benefits and a western education for their kids who would want to go back ? 
  this is about immigration rather than temporary refuge . 
  sorry about that . 
  meant to point out that the first post in this thread was talking about ez debt . 
  i do believe it was somewhat reasonable to believe you we 're talking about ez debt , but if you were n't i apologize . 
  you reacted with `` congratulations for demanding money from someone who does n't have it lying around to give away . '', 
  in response to somebody defending the ez position . 
  and earlier in the same conversation thread ~ ~ you ~ ~ someone also said :  the imf represents the views of everybody , not the ez , and outside the ez people are much more sympathetic to the greeks . 
  debt relief is the only sensible solution , however difficult it is to swallow . 
  so pointing out that it 's the imf unwilling to restructure debt while the ez debt is n't even up for repayment yet seems fairly on topic . 
  you suggested the ez is demanding money from greece , which is simply incorrect . 
  ez debt is to be repayed after 2020 and will most likely be restructured well before that . 
  it 's the imf that is demanding their debt are repayed while at the same time refusing to talk about relief for their own debt . 
  the ez does n't demand their money back for another 5 years . 
  the imf is the one demanding repayment now . 
  your country has the 4th highest imf voting power btw . 
   outside the ez people are much more sympathetic to the greeks . 
  are you joking ? 
  less than a week ago we saw many brits saying they 'd rather leave the eu or have greece go bankrupt than loan them money to bridge the gap between bailouts . 
  using efsm would have put brits at risk of about 20 euro 's per capita . 
  in the large bailout slovakians are paying 20 times that and the dutch , french and germans are paying up to 50 times that amount . 
  how can you claim ez countries are unsympathetic when your own country is unwilling to loan 2 % of what similar countries are essentially asked to donate . 
  and besides , pretty much every citizen in the ez already knows and has accepted that debt relief is coming . 
  even when the first bailout was given many knew that there was no way that every cent was going to be payed back . 
  but since the [ debt owed to ez countries is n't up for repayment for another 5 or so years ] ( http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/ ) , politcians would rather wait to see if greece is willing to pass reforms until committing to a haircut . 
  that 's not bad at all , it 's exactly what 's happening . 
  eurozone countries are already going to pay for a eurozone bailout . 
  however greece is on the brink of collapse , so short term aid is needed to avoid the state collapsing . 
  so why is it bad to consider using efsm money for it 's intended purpose ? 
  i agree , but that does n't really change my point . 
  if you want a referendum for bailout money you will need a fund to bridge the wait for the results . 
  would n't your interpretation kind of mean that only non-euro can use the efsm while euro countries still have to pay in to it ? 
  it 's indeed kind of a clusterfuck . 
  from what i can gather what 's going on is this : the large bailout will be put up for a parliamentary vote in every country . 
  the problem is that the voting will take time . 
  and since greece is at the brink of collapse money is needed earlier in order to prevent greece and it 's banks from collapsing . 
  one way of getting that money is using the efsm , a fund created by the european commission to assist eu members in financial trouble . 
  the money is raised from the financial markets with the eu countries providing guarantees . 
  the european commission president has suggested that efsm money could be used to bridge the gap between now and the arrival of the large bailout money . 
  the uk disagrees as they were promised the efsm was n't going to be used to save the euro . 
  some eu lawyers claim that the promise is n't valid because the large bailout is set up to address the euro problems , while the efsm money would be something that would prevent greece and it 's banks collapsing . 
  with the efsm money each uk citizen would guarantee the security of about 20 euros in loans to greece . 
  in comparison to the large bailout : lithuanians will pay about 113 euros , slovakians 385 , slovenians 620 and the dutch will pay 960 euros per citizen . 
  the large bailout will be put up for a parliamentary vote in every country . 
  the problem is that the voting will take time . 
  and since greece is at the brink of collapse money is needed earlier in order to prevent greece from collapsing . 
  if countries would hold a referendum , you 'd still need money to bridge the gap , in fact you 'd probably need even more . 
  so it seems somewhat logical that you some kind of fund regardless . 
  sure , and i would definitely not be in favor of forcing the usage of the efsm by outvoting the uk . 
  although as of the moment the efsm seems just a consideration . 
  britain is hardly the only country which promised it 's people that they would n't have to pay for anymore bailouts . 
  however citizens from other countries that received the promise seem far less upset , with many still supporting monetary aid for greece . 
  the atmosphere in this thread is noticeably different is all i 'm saying . 
  i mean , the uk would pay/loan like 20 bucks per capita .
