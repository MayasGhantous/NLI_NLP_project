  lithuanians pay 5 times that amount and slovakians pay nearly 20 times that . 
  despite that , this thread is full of brits acting like the eu declared war or something . 
  the dutch definition does heavily rely on the act on ` unwanted entry of the body ' but seemingly leaves enough room for the penetrator to be the victim . 
  the legal definition is something like : `` forcing someone with violence or threats into an act that involves unwanted penetration of the body '' . 
  also of note is how [ tongue kissing was sometimes counted as rape in the netherlands ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/world/europe/netherlands-forced-kiss-is-not-rape-supreme-court-rules-in-reversal.html?_r=0 ) due to the strict definition of ` unwanted entry of the body ' . 
  so that 's another example of something that can affect the comparison between countries . 
  while napoleon did bring a lot of progressive policies , the netherlands was a republic beforehand . 
  when napoleon invaded he then appointed his nephew to be king and turned the netherlands into a monarchy . 
  free education , health care , youth workers , justice system aimed at rehabilitation and many projects aimed at improving things for youth would suggest sweden never wanted ghettos . 
  it 's a very good channel and video , but i do n't think it 's correct to say that this movie is near flawless when it comes to historical accuracy . 
  the movie ( and this video ) totally ignores the fact that a large portion of wellington 's army consisted out of dutch and german troops . 
  the movie shows only english troops being present , while in reality the dutch brought an estimate of 17,000 troops ( 25 % of wellingtons army ) and several german states totaled around 20,000-26 ,000 troops ( 30 % of the army ) . 
  still an amazing movie though . 
  he clearly did n't imply the netherlands was innocent . 
  his point was that there 's few countries that are free of corruption or tax evasion . 
  so changes have to be made by all countries , otherwise you 're just going to move the problem . 
  why do people get upset over some hashtag stuff on instagram ? 
  it 's just asking people to share selfies . 
  why the hell are people suggesting the existence of this hashtag campaign influences their vote ? 
  that seems reasonable . 
  however dutch referendums can only be held about legislation that has been passed by the government . 
  so the government defending or explaining that legislation kinda of makes sense in the dutch case . 
  yeah , even the internal documents in which the government gave its members guidelines about defending their pov were called propaganda . 
  i guess a referendums is seen as a choice by the people and the government giving its opinion is then seen as interfering with that . 
   i do n't get what gives luxembourg the authority to criticize it 's called free speech, 
   they seem pretty pissed that the dutch ca n't decide the relationship eu members have with the ukraine . 
  they people behind the referendum implied that they wanted to exploit that sentiment and cause tension between the netherlands and the eu . 
  the main campaign video said that they wanted a referendum not to stop the treaty , but to send a signal . 
  basically this referendum was picked with the purpose of people getting mad at the fact that we wo n't be able to scrap the treaty . 
  [ source with english subs ] ( https://youtu.be/lalqmaweo5u?t=3m43s ), 
   that depends on the scope of the decision . 
  parts of the association agreement that are not about trade require unanimous approval by the member states . 
  it 's the first link in [ this news article ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2097196-nederlanders-zien-oekraine-verdrag-als-eerste-stap-naar-eu-lidmaatschap.html ) . 
  between the netherlands and ukraine . 
  the option they checked in the poll was : `` i do n't share the ukrainian norms and values '', 
  [ polling ] ( http://content1a.omroep.nl/urishieldv2/l27m6d8c15d1019202a70057038c26000000.9afa66fcba8c81e515a65c4264f6277c/nos/docs/050416_ipsos.pdf ) found that 46 % of people thought it was a step towards eu membership . 
  34 % of no-voters say it influenced their decision . 
  sure , was just saying that he did n't need to orchestrate anything . 
   so this campaign could 've been orchestrated by pro-russian forces ? 
  no , people just genuinely dislike the eu . 
  that is why this referendum has been set up . 
  the ukraine is collateral damage .

  it could be general concern for part of them . 
  however the website behind the campaign has been blaming ukraine and the usa for hiding the truth behind the mh17 downing . 
  apparently both countries refuse to hand over radar data . 
  the website also published theories claiming the ukraine was behind or involved in the downing ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2016/02/radarvragen_ovv_en_vvd_in_het_1.html ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2016/02/bassiehof_zomaar_een_mh17_theorie.html ) ) and has criticized reports that claimed the russian military shot down the plane ( [ 3 ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2016/02/bellingcat_deze_russen_zijn_be.html ) ) . 
  so it 's also likely many people blame the ukraine for the crash to some extent .

  the interview was widely published , but people just did n't really care about the crimea comments . 
  the no-camp also engaged in conspiracies about the mh17 downing . 
  insinuating that ukraine and the usa are hiding the truth by not handing over radar data . 
  theories about a ukrainian fighter jet hiding above the plane or a ukrainian soldier mistakenly shooting the plane were spread on the website behind the campaign . 
  the bellingcat report blaming russian soldiers for shooting down the plane was likened to conspiracy theories and the journalist behind the report ( elliot higgins ) was called a nato-employee . 
  with that level of politicking already going on unchallenged the comments justifying the crimea annexation did n't even make an impact . 
  [ polling ] ( http://content1a.omroep.nl/urishieldv2/l27m6d8c15d1019202a70057038c26000000.9afa66fcba8c81e515a65c4264f6277c/nos/docs/050416_ipsos.pdf ) found that of the people voting against : * 59 % cite corruption and lack of trust in ukraine . 
  * 34 % want to avoid eu membership . 
  * 31 % cite differences in moral values and ideologies between ukraine * 30 % are concerned about immigration from ukrainian workers * 26 % is afraid it will hurt the eu-russian relationship * 23 % are against the eu * 19 % cite the mh17 crash ... 
  it should be noted that this treaty was n't actually about ukraine joining the eu or about allowing ukrainian people to work in the eu . 
  this is not a binding referendum , it 's an advisory one . 
  so it is absolutely fine if the government takes the 70 % that did n't vote into account . 
  they also said : '' [ there ] was no annexation . 
  crimea was added to russia after a referendum . '', 
  so i would n't say they care much for ukraine 's well being . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4cpb86/people_behind_dutch_referendum_on_ukraine/d1k8yw7 ), 
  the people who started the referendum said : `` you have to understand that we do n't care about ukraine . 
  [ ... ] we will grasp any possibility to put tension on the relationship between the netherlands and the eu '' . 
  so for a lot of people this referendum was about giving a sign to the government . 
  the website behind it also ran a huge amount of negative press about ukraine and the ukrainian people . 
  lots of people now see ukraine as a failed state filled with lots of corruption and they do n't want to form a treaty because of it . 
  campaigners for the referendum have also claimed that a yes vote would lead to ukraine joining the eu . 
  this all caused the high amount of no votes as well as a high amount of people who refused to participate in this referendum . 
  no is ahead in most polls , so i 'd say the chance of not making 30 % is higher than the chance of getting a yes . 
  that is incorrect . 
  the treaty was not just passed by the european parliament but also by [ each individual national government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement#ratification ) . 
  the tweede kamer and eerste kamer both voted on and passed the treaty . 
  the numbers from rotterdam indicate that it 's going to be very close . 
  if a few more yes voters stay home the quorum might not be reached . 
  it used to be a contrarian blog site that drew in users with it 's unique style . 
  all writers used absurdist pseudonyms and the site used in-jokes , self-references and coded language to create a sense of community . 
  ` purple pants ' would for example refer to people working in marketing and when commenters talked about the ` finnish ' they referred to the moroccan community . 
  geenstijls style of writing was very verbose and they would often pride themselves on having a highly educated readership . 
  they would criticize both the left and the right and could be described as somewhat libertarian . 
  lately they have made a turn to the right and dropped quite a bit of their humorous attitude . 
  they have a few writers publishing political articles under their real names and their recent coverage is mostly about politics and specifically the referendum . 
  to give one example of their uncaring and liberal attitude making place for populism or even conservatism : recently their tv spinoff send somebody to a gay mayor to go on a date and secretly film it . 
  they then published footage of the mayor talking about sex in private and called it ` unworthy of a mayor ' . 
  the mayor was subsequently forced to resign . 
  it 's the flyer for the referendum request i think . 
  you 're right that there 's many reasons for people to vote no , though animal rights did n't show up in the opinion polling . 
  it is however the reason for opposition by the animal rights party . 
  what is being talked about is the ukraine and the us not handing over radar data to the netherlands . 
  this has lead to speculation about a ukrainian fighter jet being close or hiding above the plane . 
  the main website behind the referendum also posted [ a blog ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2016/02/bassiehof_zomaar_een_mh17_theorie.html ) by one of their columnists where he speculated that a ukrainian soldier misinterpreted intelligence and that kiev then decided to destroy evidence of their involvement . 
  the website behind the referendum ( geenstijl ) has been pushing the angle that america and ukraine were involved in or hiding something about the downing of the plane as they refuse to hand over radar data . 
  they [ responded ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2016/02/bellingcat_deze_russen_zijn_be.html ) to the bellingcat research by calling eliot higgins a nato-employee and comparing it to chemtrail conspiracies . 
  geenstijl is one of the most popular news/opinion sites in the netherlands , so the fact that 19 % people end up citing the crash is n't all that surprising . 
  the quote by the chairman of the committee that started the initiative is very relevant to what the article is talking about . 
  and how can you suggest that i misrepresent the motivations of the no-camp when i have included a poll that shows exactly those motivations ?
