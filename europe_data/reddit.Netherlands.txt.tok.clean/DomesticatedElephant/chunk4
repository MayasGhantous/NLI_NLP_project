  the propaganda claim is also really ironic . 
  the [ people behind the referendum can ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4cpb86/people_behind_dutch_referendum_on_ukraine/d1k8yw7 ) compare juncker to putin , defend the crimea takeover and claim an imperialist europe is steering for war with russia . 
  [ geenstijl can ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/ ) spend like 70 % of their coverage on the treaty , spending lots of time painting ukraine as a failed state and even engaging in mh17 conspiracy theories . 
  the [ public face of the referendum can tell people on national tv ] ( http://nos.nl/video/2096208-wat-gebeurt-bij-een-nee-bij-het-oekraine-referendum.html ) : `` it 's really simple , are you in favour or against the ukraine joining the eu ? '' . 
  the [ campaign flyer can ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/archives/images/gpflyerfront.png ) refer to an `` eu-referendum '' , the official [ campaign video can ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lalqmaweo5u ) show a picture of a protest in moscow and claim it 's from the maidan square , claim people with nazis sympathies got into power after ukraine 's government fled and refer to ukraine as putin 's doormat . 
  but when i point out how low the people pushing for this referendum have stooped i 'm the one doing propaganda ? 
  for what it 's worth , i 'm not doing this as part of some secret plot to promote the yes-camp . 
  i just really dislike whatever the hell this referendum turned out to be . 
  last elections were legitimate , and there 's over 12 parties represented in government . 
  so compared to so many other countries on the planet i 'd say dutch people are quite well off when it comes to representation . 
  also , even if you are against the treaty , it seems a little weird to suggest that the government betrayed the dutch people by signing . 
  there enough argument for the treaty to simply assume they tried to handle in the best interest of the netherlands . 
   the eu just deciding big things for their own without consulting the people . 
  i really do n't get where this is coming from . 
  this treaty was [ ratified ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement#ratification ) by way over 50 democratically elected bodies of government . 
  not sure what the dig at the eu is for , the treaty was ratified by over 50 democratically elected bodies of government . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement#ratification ), 
  that is part of the reason . 
  46 % of people are convinced this treaty is a first step to eu membership . 
  for people voting against : * 59 % of people cite corruption and lack of trust in ukraine . 
  * 34 % want to avoid eu membership . 
  * 31 % cite differences in moral values and ideologies between ukraine * 30 % are concerned about immigration from ukraininian workers * 26 % is afraid it will hurt the eu-russian relationship * 23 % are against the eu * 19 % cite the mh17 crash ... 
  giving brussels a headache is exactly what it is meant to do . 
  the people who started the referendum [ said ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4cpb86/people_behind_dutch_referendum_on_ukraine/d1k8yw7 ) the following :  `` you have to understand that we do n't care about ukraine . 
  [ ... ] a nexit-referendum is currently impossible . 
  that is why we will grasp any possibility to put tension on the relationship between the netherlands and the eu '' they also said stuff like :  '' [ there ] was no annexation . 
  crimea was added to russia after a referendum . '', 
  edit : [ polling ] ( http://content1a.omroep.nl/urishieldv2/l27m6d8c15d1019202a70057038c26000000.9afa66fcba8c81e515a65c4264f6277c/nos/docs/050416_ipsos.pdf ) indicates 46 % of people are convinced this treaty is a first step to eu membership .

   do not add your opinion/commentary to the article 's title . 
  my opinion and commentary were n't in the title . 
   do n't add something that is n't covered by the article , and do n't misrepresent the article . 
  every point was covered by the article , and like i said , the title even has the same quote . 
  i hope you do n't suggest i should have submitted the following title `` we do n't care about ukraine '' . 
   even if taken directly from the submission , a title must not be misleading . 
  if what one assumes from reading the title is different from what the article says or what is reported by multiple other sources , then your submission may be removed . 
  the interview has 2 parts , one about the eu and one about russia and the ukraine . 
  my title included quotes summarizing their feelings on to both sections . 
   this also applies if the title states an opinion as a fact . 
  if the original title is misleading , you may give it a more neutral \\ factual title . 
  quotes were announced and put in brackets . 
  i hardly took the worst quotes out of the interview . 
  the people interviewed claimed russia did n't annex crimea , implied the crimean referendum was legitimate and said there 's no difference between juncker or putin . 
  they also said the eu reminds them of the soviet union and implied and an imperialist eu is steering for war with russia . 
  including any of those and not including the actual quotes would have been editorializing . 
  however the quotes i put in the headlines were the quote taken from the title , the explanation that followed said quote and to make things more relevant to this sub a quote regarding ukraine . 
  the quotes summarize their stance on the association agreement . 
  translation of most of the article : [ the referendum on the association agreement between the eu and the ukraine ] , an initiative by ` citizens committee eu ' , seemed like an impossible plan . 
  it only got wings when some it-specialists contacted website geenstijl with the proposal to build an app that would allow people to submit their signatures digitally . 
  at the end of september 2015 over 450.000 dutch citizens had given their signatures . 
  and that 's how millions of voters will go to to the polls the next wednesday . 
  `` you have to understand that we do n't care about ukraine '' says historian arjan van dixhoorn , chairman of the citizens committee . 
  the founders have only one goal , destroying the eu or driving the netherlands out of it , a so called nexit . 
  `` a nexit-referendum is currently impossible . 
  that is why we will grasp any possibility to put tension on the relationship between the netherlands and the eu '' explains van dixhoorn . 
  ** what is so bad about the eu ? 
  ** van dixhoorn : \u201e well , we only have to say one thing about it . 
  i myself was a europhile until 2005 . 
  that 's when the european constitution came . 
  some kind of elitist committee was created with giscard d\u2019estaing from france and other elitists , and they were going to create this constitution for us . 
  that whole process was wrong . 
  and worst of all , when a referendum was held in the netherlands with a no-vote as the result , it was pushed trough anyway '' van houwelingen : \u201e that was the ` original sin ' . 
  if the referendum had resulted in a yes vote you would not have heard us '' ** but what is so bad about eu policy ? 
  ** \u201e that is actually not that relevant . 
  i was not opposed to the eu myself , i was in favor of it . 
  since the original sin took place i have been thinking further and the eu became an increasingly bad idea . 
  it becomes increasingly less constitutional and is constantly grasping for more power . 
  the idea that uniforming all european people is going to cause freedom , prosperity and and peace has been revealed to be a lie . 
  i 'm sure the beautiful dream is possible , but the eu would have to be organized democratically from the ground up . 
  with lots of power for individual states and lots of referendums . 
  currently it is reminiscent of the soviet union . '' ** let 's say the current eu is gone . 
  how do you think cross-border problems like climate change and terror should be handled ? 
  ** van dixhoorn : \u201e you can discuss with other countries , you do n't need a centralist eu . 
  that 's what states are made for . '' ** those states have waged a lot of war until 1945 . 
  ** van dixhoorn : \u201e you know what caused all that blood to be spilled ? 
  it was because of imperialisme from germany , england or italy during the fascist regime with its attempts to restore the roman empire . 
  it is exactly what the eu is doing right now . '' ** but eu countries would n't be quick to declare war upon each other ? 
  ** van dixhoorn : \u201e do you like it that instead of fighting each other we will be waging war against russia ? 
  because that is how it is . 
  we hope the imperialist european union is going to collapse . 
  it 's a 19th century solution to a 21th century world . '', 
  ** what are you political leanings ? 
  ** van dixhoorn : \u201e i started at the reformed political league and have even been a member of the green party . 
  but currently i 'm not a member of any party . 
  i do n't even vote anymore , the current political system is bankrupt . 
  the parliament only recognizes the eu als sovereign as opposed the the dutch people . 
  van houwelingen : \u201e i voted for the libertarian party last elections '' ** why is the treaty with ukraine bad for the netherlands ? 
  ** van houwelingen : \u201e firstly , it strengthens the eu , while we are against the eu . 
  but you also have financial support , and we are already spending a lot of money on greece . 
  and there 's the agreement for visa free travel , which allows ukrainians to travel to the netherlands more easily . 
  there 's even talk of military support . '' ** the treaty does n't mean we wil support the ukraine militarily ** van dixhoorn : \u201e oh , just wait . 
  those treaties have to be read with understanding . 
  you also must understand that when it comes to it , the pressure on the eu to help will become very big due to this association agreement . '' ** you claim that the treaty is bad for ukraine , because it would divide the country . 
  yet according to the result of the elections it is the wish of the ukrainian people to have a pro european course . 
  ** van dixhoorn : \u201e surely , you do n't believe everything that is being said about those elections ? 
  do you really think ukrainians were properly informed about the content of the treaty ? 
  there has n't been a referendum about it , right ? '' ** if it were up to you the sanctions against russia would be removed . 
  but those have been put in place after the annexation of crimea .
