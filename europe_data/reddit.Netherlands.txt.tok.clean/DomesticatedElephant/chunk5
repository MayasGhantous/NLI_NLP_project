  do n't you have trouble with that annexation ? 
  ** van dixhoorn : \u201e that was no annexation . '' ** the people in green , who in february 2014 took over the crimean parliament , those were russians right ? 
  ** van dixhoorn : \u201e crimea was added to russia after a referendum . '' ** that referendum only took place after those people in green took power , right ? 
  ** van houwelingen : \u201e yes , but that was only after a coup in ukraine '' ** if there 's a problem in a country , that does n't mean the neighbor should invade , right ? 
  ** van dixhoorn : \u201e you must know the history of crimea ? 
  there has been a coup there and russia supported the russian population there , that also how you can see it . 
  we are the cause of that annexation . 
  because of the association agreement that divided ukraine . '' beata supheert joins the conversation . 
  she builds websites and has assisted the committee with that and other tasks . 
  she claims to be disappointed in europe as a social project . 
  calmly she explain that she sees to much power for multinationals in the eu and to little for the ordinary citizen . 
  \u201e the voice of reason joined '' , says van dixhoorn . 
  supheert : \u201e i 'm not the least angry one by the way . 
  i can also go out of my mind . '' ** back to putin for a moment . 
  you claim that in the europhile netherlands it is prohibited to say anything positive about putin . 
  this is your chance . 
  ** van dixhoorn : \u201e there 's nothing positive to be said about putin . 
  the same goes for juncker ( president of the european commission ) by the way . 
  i see no difference between them . '' supheert : \u201e they both lust for power '' * note : i left out some sections regarding the mechanics of requesting the referendum and regarding the website that helped them . 
  the dutch title is literally `` we do n't care about ukraine '' ... that statement in the interview is followed up by : `` a nexit-referendum is currently impossible . 
  that is why we will grasp any possibility to increase tensions between the netherlands and the eu . '', 
  they do say some more reasonable stuff later on , but the article itself does lead with my first 2 quotes . 
  like i said , i disagree with the idea and i have no problems with ukraine joining when it is ready . 
  i was just stating the fact that many people in the netherlands are afraid of eastern european criminals and work migrants . 
  it 's a major reason for people to vote away the trade/association treaty in the upcoming referendum . 
  beats me . 
  people are afraid that it will cause an influx of migrant workers and criminals . 
  it 's not about an actual scenario . 
  many people in the netherlands want to block the upcoming trade/association agreement because they think it will lead to ukraine joining nato and the eu . 
  the pm is trying to remove those fears . 
  i was n't talking about the interests of nordic people . 
  the nato/usa have an interest in blocking off russia , so some nordic countries could be in nato even if they 'd spend nothing on defense . 
  iceland even does it already . 
  denmark blocks off the baltic sea , which is relevant as russia has [ land ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaliningrad_oblast ) and a [ fleet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_fleet#under_the_russian_federation ) there . 
  greenland is also part of denmark , which means the north of the atlantic sea is blocked off by nato countries . 
  just check google maps , russia has no way to control the seas to the east of them . 
  not really . 
  breivik hated islam so much that he thought western people should join christianity to counteract it . 
  he argued that even if you do n't believe in god , you could be a cultural or agnostic christian . 
  religion was n't used as an argument but rather as a tool . 
  that 's quite different from groups who recruit people with religious arguments . 
  there 's also a huge difference between targeting cartoonists and targeting a gathering of a political party . 
  countries like denmark , norway and iceland could spend nothing or even ask for money . 
  their location is what is important to nato , not their budget . 
  i do n't think it 's fair to equate the belief that you can get better trade deals right after ripping up your current treaties with economic analysis by experts . 
  and the us and europe already said they are not going to bend over and give the uk significantly better trade deals than other countries . 
  the eu especially is n't going to give the uk a better deal than norway as that would pretty much mean those countries would renegotiate as well and half the eu countries would leave to also get the same deal . 
   it 's not something that requires your agreement . 
  true , but social sciences and the un agree with me to quite an extent . 
   jews are/were generally considered to be a race , not just a religion . 
  based on the orthodox interpretation that you can only be a jew if your mother was/is one . 
  that does not imply that jewish people are part of one race . 
   that 's the only way to phrase it correctly , otherwise your ` argument ' would be bollocks . 
  `` the possible presence of a moroccan passport does not make otherwise ethnic discriminatory statements okay . '', 
  in fact , since my original example contained the insults `` berber-monkey '' and `` rif-monkey '' , could you tell me if those are racist insults ? 
  i probably disagree with your unspecified definition of racism then . 
  race and racism are n't simply defined by skin color alone . 
  legally discrimination based on ethnicity is considered racial discrimination . 
  in general speech it is often the same , antisemitism for example is regarded as a form racism regardless of context or skin colour . 
  anyway , my argument does n't change if i would have used ` ethnic discrimination ' . 
  so it 's 26.6 % at its highest point in the most favorable poll , he 's just simply not as widely liked as you made it seem . 
  lots of parties and people have fully disavowed him after his recent comment . 
  and i do n't see that getting better now that he and his following are doubling down on calling for the reduction of an ethnic group present in the netherlands . 
  their nationality is dutch , they live here . 
  their ethnicity is moroccan . 
  the possible presence of a moroccan passport does not make otherwise racist statements okay . 
  and considering that i 've seen people throw around the words berber-monkey and rif-monkey i 'd say that extremists are well aware of it and do treat the group as an ethnicity . 
   he has almost 1/3 of the population behind him even polls that are highly favorable to him ( maurice the hond ) only give him 25 % of the vote . 
  20 % is a more reasonable estimate . 
  source : [ collection of opinion polls ] ( http://frontbencher.nl/peilingen/ ), 
  not really sure if it 's legally sustainable . 
  he basically doubled down on what he said and threw some insults towards his political opponents and a judge . 
  very entertaining and rewarding for people who like him , but legally it not incredibly relevant . 
  a judge in his current trial once stated that a judge in the previous trial should not have been substituted after a complaint by wilders lawyer . 
  legally not important , but for some this is proof that the justice system is biased . 
  as for his actual defense , he basically claimed that it 's legal to call for the reduction or removal of an ethnic group if you have legal or non-violent means to do so ( encouraging voluntary emigration , deporting criminals and stopping immigration ) . 
  he 's been around for a very long time and pretty much nobody has been calling for a trial until very recently . 
  he literally got a crowd to chant for the reduction of an ethnic group within the netherlands and promised his intent carry out their wishes . 
  so suggesting that he 's prosecuted to crush general dissent seems incorrect . 
  i personally prefer full free speech , but if you have laws that ban racist incitement of hatred then i 'd say a trial seems legally justified in this case . 
   do the dutch taxpayers not get tired of these inquisitions every few years ? 
  it 's kind of a media circus , but the last time was n't really that interesting . 
  the first time around public prosecutors refused to start a case , however after activists went to the court , it ruled that according to the laws in place a trial should be held . 
  in that trial the public prosecutors still pleaded for a `` not guilty '' verdict . 
  sadly , that does n't stop people from claiming the government and justice system are behind some conspiracy to get him locked up . 
  he and his lawyer essentially claimed that it 's legal to call for the reduction or removal of an ethnic group if you have legal means to do so . 
  not sure how that destroys the case , but it does allow him to campaign from the stand . 
   his laywer was also hacked that 's incorrect . 
  the statement was mailed to a number of people , after which somebody leaked the opening statement to the press . 
  it 's possible or even likely that a member of wilders political party leaked it . 
  according to a different newspaper the contact was made by phone and a face to face meeting was to be arranged to hand over the files . 
  that does not sound like a hackers work whatsoever , and people from his party have leaked stuff before . 
  the amount of people making criminal charges or some of them not being genuine is n't relevant . 
  if there 's one or more legit criminal charges being filed the prosecutors should take action . 
  nope , he told people to form resistance . 
  this can be explained peacefully as well as violently . 
  he explicitly refused to condemn the first violent incident and only spoke out when more happened . 
   do you want more or less moroccans in this country ? 
   - * crowd and party members shout `` less , less , less '' *  well , we are going to make sure that happens after saying that he was pretty much blacklisted by every other party until he makes an apology or correction . 
  singling out an ethnic group and calling to get rid of them goes quite a few steps to far .
