  i do n't think people have an issue with the guardian news section , but their blog section is often criticized for having poor standards . 
  instead of trying to form a coherent argument many sites and blogs try to edge each other out by publishing the most polarizing articles . 
  a purposefully biased blog draws in the group it 's biased towards but also draws in the group it 's biased against due to people on reddit , facebook and twitter pointing to it as an example of how their group is treated unfairly . 
  nope , it 's about keeping leverage and not losing their electorate . 
  the debt to the eurozone only needs to start being repaid from 2020 onwards . 
  committing to debt relief now would mean losing leverage over greece and in most eu countries populist parties would steamroll the next election due to voter outrage . 
  there 's no reason whatsoever for eurozone countries to hand out debt relief now . 
  they all know it 's going to happen , but they 'll push it to their successors and make it dependent on greek reforms . 
  they are in fact refugees by law . 
  being a refugee means that your country of origin is unsafe . 
  being a refugee essentially means you are stateless and looking for ( temporary ) asylum . 
  america is n't going to let europe threaten a nato ally ... 
  france and the netherlands are actually protecting the uk borders by preventing refugees from getting to the uk trough calais or hoek van holland . 
  yeah . 
  sinking civilian boats in territory of foreign nations sounds much better . 
  they enter trough [ hungary , slovenia , serbia and croatia . 
  ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/washingtonpost/2015/09/16/foreign/graphics/2300-migrants-9-16-15v2.jpg ) as you can see , there 's plenty of ways around the hungarian closed border with serbia . 
  you ca n't just sail into the waters of a sovereign nation and unload hundreds of thousands of people onto the beaches against their will . 
  that 's a great common sense idea . 
  but refugees can simply bypass the giant waiting list by getting themselves into european countries . 
  if a refugee comes from a war torn country , international treaties say that you 'll have to give this person temporary asylum . 
  and turkey is n't going to take them back anyway . 
  so it 's not unwillingness to process people in refugee camps , but rather the fact that people can bypass that process . 
  not much unfortunately . 
  turkey could be asked/forced to take action against smugglers . 
  once the boats are in greek waters there 's not much you can do . 
  the dublin agreement meant that germany and others could force greece to take them all in , but that was obviously seen as a bad idea . 
  it 's also interesting to note that greece does n't share land borders with other eu countries . 
  the refugees leave the eu and then re-enter trough countries like hungary . 
  turkey is not going to take over a million refugees back in , no matter the money you throw at them . 
  the dublin agreement is not enforced anyway . 
  why get mad at the eu when it 's only looking to replace an agreement that memberstates have rejected and stopped enforcing ? 
  you are missing the fact that the dublin regulation is pointless , unfair and outdated . 
  nobody is enforcing it anymore anyway . 
  if the eu wants to create a sensible refugee policy , they 'll have to replace it . 
  as for your second question . 
  turkey and other countries simply wo n't allow europe to dump a million refugees back into their country . 
  pretty much every country gives ( automatic ) asylum to refugees and syrians are simply recognized as refugees by the un . 
  what germany announced was that they would n't be sending the refugees back to countries like greece , thus suspending the dublin agreement . 
  the idea what germany purposefully screwed over it 's neighbors seems misguided . 
  enforcing the dublin agreement would have meant that germany would have the right to send every single refugee back to it 's neighbors or the southern and eastern countries . 
  the imf has no choice but to demand this . 
  the imf has a set rule that they ca n't loan money until creditors have made debt sustainable . 
  so when asked about loans to greece they will have to respond this way . 
  that does n't mean that debt reduction has to happen now . 
  eurozone loans payoffs start in about 2020 or so , there 's no way eu leaders will risk an outrage by their electorate when they can postpone that decision to more stable times and later governments . 
  and even if losing power to populist movements was n't a risk , the eurozone would still want to keep the debt reduction as leverage for as long as possible . 
  that 's one of the reasons why we wo n't see debt reduction . 
  the eurozone loans wo n't start being payed off until 2020 . 
  so why would european leaders risk losing their positions and give the keys the the populists when greece does n't have to pay them yet anyway ? 
  and that 's not even mentioning that they 'll lose all leverage . 
  he also wants a `` facerag tax '' and deport muslims who commit crimes along with their family . 
  last year or so he got a crowd to chant for ` less moroccans ' and promised to get it done . 
  after that pretty much all other parties have vowed to no longer cooperate with him . 
  the recent poll was held with viewers of a conservative news program . 
  not really a reliable indicator of turn-out or outcome . 
  there 's almost no immigration from morocco . 
  when people talk about moroccans they almost always mean 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants . 
  the people who organized the referendum pretty much blame the eu and ukraine for the conflict . 
  their main argument is also that there 's to much instability for a treaty to be acceptable , they cite the tragedy as an example of that . 
   undemocratic fascism in action people . 
  wonderful . 
  the treaty has been ratified by [ over 50 democratically elected ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement#ratification ) bodies of government . 
   this is nothing more than a dictatorial move by the most undemocratic political entity imaginable . 
  the treaty has been approved by [ over 50 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement#ratification ) democratically elected bodies of government ... 
  the only party that tried to get her citizenship revoked was her own party , the vvd . 
  the minister of immigration ( member of the vvd ) considered her citizenship application to be invalid . 
  the vast majority of other parties disapproved of that approach and demanded a more careful review , after which the attempt to strip her citizenship was abandoned . 
  this was already known before . 
  and his point was that you ca n't really eavesdrop ps4 communications easily , especially if people start talking in a game . 
  the racists in europe are also racist against for example polish and romani people . 
  you ca n't really apply the american view of racism to europe . 
  just because a polish person is white it does n't mean he 's somehow privileged or free from being targeted by racism and prejudice when he lives in western europe . 
  you have to look at things in terms of ethnicity or nationality . 
  he was , but the muslim brotherhood had always been the arch enemies of the egyptian military . 
  if a different candidate was elected there would probably still have been a democracy . 
  by having immigrants with brown skin , would n't the training discover racism by police officers and be able to correct it ? 
  i assume the training would have a focus on deescalation and control as the immigrants are n't violent . 
  this is about the net neutrality amendment not the entire electronic communications law , so voting yes is a good thing . 
  the amendment would have closed the loopholes and made sure europe had strong net neutrality . 
  unfortunately it got defeated with 231 in favour and 411 against . 
  votewatch has a more extensive version : [ who voted what on `` net neutrality '' ? 
  ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/blog/who-voted-what-on-net-neutrality/ ) using the table with votes i made an overview to see which eu member states had the most impact on the net neutrality vote . 
  ** top 5 countries by net contribution of yes-votes : ** * 1 . 
  netherlands - 10 * ( 17 yes , 7 no ) * * 1 . 
  germany - 10 * ( 48 yes , 38 no ) * * 3 . 
  austria - 8 * ( 13 yes , 5 no ) * * 4 .

  the airplane was partially rebuilt to reveal the impact pattern . 
  they even used the 4 pilot microphones to triangulate the exact location of the missile explosion .

  yeah , i 'm sure most parties know that debt relief is sensible but there 's just no way the eurozone will give up their leverage and risk backlash from voters when greece does n't even have to repay the debt until 2020 .
