ahh , the cheap man 's runescape white wizard costume ... 
  boy that brings me back . 
  guess now we know what his username means . 
   honestly i do n't know , i 've been contemplating leaving seeing as most of my favourite contributors have left because of the vitriolic atmosphere . 
  it is no longer a sub dedicated to civil discourse but a sub where you get attacked and downvoted for * not * generalising `` da muslimz '' . 
  the mods should just act harder against this kind of behaviour . 
  only then it can go back like it was before . 
  he must be right !, 
  why else would someone put soo much effort to press the shift key for every letter he types ? 
  and also the answer why aliens would actively avoiding us ... 
  iraq was very fucking stable till the english came , they fucked shit up what leaded to saddam eventually get in power , what lead to what is now . 
  yeah totally not the fault of forced colonization ... 
  oppression of women ? 
  ohh yeah , i forgot there is absolutely no way that someone would wear that free willingly . 
  and do n't let anyone tell you otherwise !, 
  considering some people know no shame , its possible he 's stupid enough to do such thing . 
  shhhh , you 're not supposed to be reasonable and using your brains during a circlejerk !, 
  pretty ironic to say that in / r/europe . 
  the fact that this got upvoted is just very sad . 
  seriously , op provided 0 evidence for this yet it got to the frontpage . 
  then explain why [ pkk killed 2 peshmerges last may ] ( http://www.basnews.com/en/news/2015/05/24/pkk-attacks-kdpi-killing-two-peshmerga/ ) if they 're supposed to be allied ? 
  or that the [ pkk have been asked to leave the area of iraq kudistan ] ( http://www.pppfocus.com/peshmerga-chief-urges-pkk-to-leave-iraq-s-kurdish-region-8743/ ) . 
  if i recall correctly : he said in the posts that it was peshmerga wear , which do n't have anything to do with pkk ( except for fighting daesh ) . 
  but these ones where n't : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3krpt3/z/cuzyplq, 
  yeah i have , and no i do n't support pkk . 
   pkk supporters always produce misinformation . 
  just like ~ ~ turkish ~ ~ nationalists . 
   they 're not getting attacked because they 're kurdish ignoramus . 
  yeah , totally not because they 're kurdish : http://imgur.com/hozywr1 http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-nationalists-beat-compatriot-after-presuming-him-to-be-kurdish.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=88199&amp;newscatid=341 http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/kurdish-man-forced-to-kiss-ataturk-statue-in-southwest-turkey.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=88198&amp;newscatid=341, 
  ohh thats why i see mob lynching against kurds in turkey almost daily in the news . 
  and thats why kurdish parties ' offices are getting attacked multiple times a year ... 
  well thats the first time i see the kurds starting a fight . 
  they 're indeed clearly doing wrong . 
  i was n't talking about the car running people over accident . 
  but i agree that the kurds in that video where at fault . 
   you can watch the full video on / r / turkey . 
  i do n't want to link the thread because of the brigading issue . 
  then post a np link . 
  or just the link to the video itself then . 
  edit : nvm , you did it . 
  damn , your sources are better then mine . 
  probably should n't have used google 's news search : /, 
  and from violence from nationalist turks . 
  not all turks are bad but if you 're kurdish and live in turkey you will get a very rough time . 
  [ planning to build a damn on ancient kurdish village ] ( http://researchturkey.org/hasankeyf-caught-in-the-crossfire-the-pkk-the-akp-and-the-end-of-civilisations/ ) http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/opinion/turkeys-war-of-distraction-on-kurds.html?_r=0 http://news.antiwar.com/2015/09/08/turkish-police-snipers-killing-kurdish-civilians-in-southeast/ ( not sure how reliable this source is though ) http://blog.amnestyusa.org/europe/kurdish-kids-and-turkeys-shameful-prisons/ http://www.dailystar.com.lb/news/middle-east/2014/aug-19/267678-clash-over-kurdish-rebel-statue-in-turkey-kills-1.ashx, 
  they are , you do n't want to know how nationalistic some turks can be . 
  you should look at / r/kurdistan , news like these attacks are daily posted there since it happens daily . 
  turks are fed up with the pkk attacks and attack kurdish people on sight since apperantly if you 're kurdish you 're also a terrorist/pkk . 
  while the pkk is fed up with the turkish goverment because they try to destroy the kurdish culture and force assimilation , and also because the turkish airforce is regulary bombing kurdish villages in syria/iraq . 
  when ever i see a comment of a nationalist or a ( race/nation/religion ) phobe , claiming all people from said race/nation/religion are bad because of lunatics like isis . 
  i only can think : `` glad you do n't have a gun , because you 're basicly saying the same shit the lunatics are saying . '', 
  actually the u.s had things changed for the better , but they should n't have left so soon . 
  but to blame the u.s for this ? 
  better blame maliki . 
  till reading the edit [ i was like ] ( https://media0.giphy.com/media/m9no5eaogbdjk/giphy.gif ), 
  do n't be stupid . 
  all non-western people are animals and should be treaded like one . 
  i know that feel , bro . 
  nederlands : invasie i 'm partly kurd , but idk what `` invasion '' means in kurdish . 
  family maybe ? 
  indeed this started all like : `` nah , not my problem . 
  so who cares ? '', 
  but thats a dumb way to think . 
  the world ai n't in medieval times anymore where getting to another country is a very fucking hard job . 
  we 're in a time where countries over the world are connected to each other , not just over internet , via roads or land . 
  but also politacally . 
  we 're not in a time anymore to expect if we do n't interfere with a problem , we wo n't notice it . 
  the world has been connected in such strong way that if a problem arise , that the whole world will feel the consequences . 
  in more ways than you can imagine . 
  tell me , how much better are the `` benefits '' in sweden compared to germany anyway . 
  and how are the immigrants supposed to know that ? 
  more often ai n't it sweden 's job to decide wether they may to go to sweden and not the german 's their job ? 
   it 's not our problems , though . 
  well , it is now . 
  or do you want the immigration to continue like this ? 
  no shit ... 
  if they actually fought isis , or actually helped the rebels in syria this would n't happen . 
  since then we gave the immigrants a good reason to stay . 
  ( / s ) that if you refuse to solve problems , problems will spread out towards you . 
  anti terrorist minded turks ? 
  then those people should be against erdogan for giving isis a free passage . 
  or the fact the he 's the one fueling the war against pkk and give pkk reasons to reteliate . 
   because they 're picky fuckers . 
  by the looks of it so are you , being picky about immigrants and their freedom of choices . 
  ohh hey !, 
  a post including kurdish * upvotes * . 
  if turkey does n't want to join eu can we join instead ? 
   nationalistic ? 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
   edit : just to clarify - i do n't say that we should n't take them and i feel sorry for everyone who has to leave his country because of war but ... how ? 
  how can we solve this problem ? 
  unification , helping other countries , world domimation . 
  as long the country of orgin still has problems people will try to get out there to have a better life . 
  and often those countries either ca n't solve their problems on their own or the leader simply do n't wants to . 
  i wish one of the nations already finished this long overdue civ game so worrying about someones race , culture and nationality became a thing of the past . 
  never knew / r/europe was so anti-immigration ... 
  same goals does n't mean they work together or are connected . 
  now i feel like i miss something important since i never watched this as child : /, 
  thats because hallal meat often get imported from other countries . 
  so the impact of this was very small .
