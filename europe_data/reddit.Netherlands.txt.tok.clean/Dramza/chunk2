  with a phone with a removable battery , its very easy to switch it out with another battery for maybe 10-20 euros . 
  also having a new full battery to pop in when the current one is empty without having to charge it is very useful in the right situations . 
  aside from that , battery breakages are one of the most common reason that a phone breaks because they are one of the most vulnerable parts of a phone . 
  do you have a few hundreds of billions to compensate for all the phones needlessly thrown out only because of battery issues ? 
  thanks for your input , it is interesting . 
  the commies ' anti-religion policies did n't work very well in other eastern european countries that they occupied though . 
   just because the battery is not removable does n't mean you ca n't replace it after a certain period if you wish so . 
  which will void the warranty and make it lose it 's waterproof properties if it has any . 
  sure . 
  are you willing to invest a few 100 million euros to help start it up ? 
  just because they do n't identify as atheist , does n't mean that they are actively religious . 
  wonder what 's going on in the czech republic . 
  i 'll be forced to get a new phone when my phone reaches the end of its life . 
  i just really dislike it when i ca n't switch out my batteries in a phone , because my old battery has decreased lifespan or just as a backup battery when traveling , so that i do n't have to charge the phone . 
  so , since phones without removable batteries are automatically disqualified for me , i 'm forced to get a lower range one . 
  i will think about it . 
  it 's specs look low a bit on the low-range side though . 
  i 'd be looking for a mid-range one . 
  there 's plenty of mid-range phones with replaceable batteries . 
  yeah i gave up on this guy already . 
  i should n't have carried it on for so long . 
  yeah i will be forced to do this when i get a new phone . 
  not really . 
  physical strength might not come as easy to women in general as for some men , but they can overcome that by exercising more . 
  i have a few women doing gymnastics in my family and you would not think it by looking at them , but they are surprisingly strong . 
  it is well achievable for most women . 
  among men there are also strong gradations of strength , and unless they are exceptionally weak ( if at all ) , this is not used as an excuse for why they ca n't be on the front lines . 
  what ends up happening is the strongest soldiers in the group ends up shouldering more of the weight when it is necessary in the field - not everyone is capable of it all . 
  fuck yes . 
  i want replaceable batteries and other components to be mandatory . 
  they lose capacity fairly quickly and most of the recent high-end models have built-in batteries . 
  haha you 're calling me a `` meninist '' for insisting on equality . 
  ok , `` feminist '' who apparently insists on inequality . 
  if you 're getting at the idea that women should n't be on the front lines directly fighting enemy combatants because they are somehow unsuitable or less suitable for that , you 've been ** proven wrong ** by the many women who have served in those roles successfully . 
  and if people have some kind of mental or physical limitations that make them unsuitable for that , of course they should be given another role , regardless of gender . 
  all i 'm saying is apply the same selection criteria to both genders , and if that creates a gender disparity in some roles that 's fine , but i do n't really see much reason that it should . 
   but it is free to show some ignorance on the internet , you can keep doing so , totally fair . 
  that 's what * you * are doing and can keep doing . 
  have fun . 
   a catalan government is making an illegal referendum to take over the spanish government . 
  you do n't know what the words separatism , referendum or coup mean . 
  you 're just playing a semantics game to make them look bad . 
  no , a coup would be if they forcefully took over the national government . 
  what they are doing is separatism , it 's very different . 
  your `` arguments '' do n't make any sense . 
  also you do understand what a referendum is , do n't you ? 
  you seem to not understand the definition of the most basic terms . 
  also anyone who is powerful enough to attack nato and europe and get far enough to reach the netherlands as a whole will have nukes . 
  much help conscription would be against that . 
  like einstein said , ww4 will be fought with sticks and stones . 
  ww3 would be over too quickly for conscription to be useful . 
  separatism = / = coup , plus the independence itself is democratic , so you ca n't complain about lack of democracy . 
  saying that it is not democratic because the rest of spain votes to force catalonia to stay with the cesspool is just wrong . 
  whatever their problems are , if a referendum for regional independence is won anywhere , it is their moral right to secede . 
  you 're right , but you do n't need conscription for that . 
  plenty of people will willingly sign up for the military . 
  in the highly unlikely case that the country is in immediate danger ( we 're sandwiched between the uk , france and germany , three of the strongest nato powers ) recruiting a bunch of untrained snot noses will be too late . 
  give me a realistic scenario in which the landlocked country of switzerland is threatened by invasion from its neighbors . 
  back then , wars between european countries were a realistic possibility but now , you think germany , france or italy is going to restart their empires again ? 
  fourth reich that loves and ca n't wait for millions of muslim immigrants , a new napoleon bonaparte from the french socialists or roman empire 2 : democracy ? 
  it 's stupid ... switzerland has no possible threats that it needs a big military for . 
  yeah , switzerland definitely needs conscription , otherwise they would n't be free and they would be overran by france in a day and have all their freedoms taken away right ? 
  absolutely . 
  i do n't like conscription and i 'm glad my country does n't have it , but if a country has it and they pretend to have equality between genders , then it ca n't be gender specific and all genders have to serve under the exact same conditions . 
  the answer is probably simple : they want to spread their religion & beliefs . 
   if you piss people off as badly as saudi arabia has , those people will be chomping at the bit for an opportunity to turn on you . 
  western politicians seem to have a complete hard-on for them , regardless . 
  it 's just a case where the public 's interests coincide with russian interests as seems to happen a lot lately . 
  they 're just telling them to do it and how to do it . 
  because they are `` allies '', 
  i hope they get independence from that corrupt , incompetent government and wish them good luck . 
  if independence is gained there will be issues but you 'll get better in the long term . 
  the incident happened in the waters of libya , not international waters . 
  go ahead and show me your expertise about libyan maritime law , and what should happen to bleeding hearts who try to interfere with official rescue missions because it is their goal to ferry as many ** illegal ** immigrants to europe as they can . 
  tell me what should happen with human traffickers . 
  is it tightly controlled right now ? 
  i do n't see the point , the immigrants will just go around to other countries and then enter germany . 
  oh yeah , that 's been on my mind too . 
  the living areas of millions of people will flood permanently , and that 's just the start . 
  the thing is it 's not just a choice . 
  in order to become the `` bad guys '' , european countries would have to exit from the human rights treaties , something that 'll never happen . 
  a marshall plan for africa would be an epic undertaking because there are far more people in africa than western europe , it is a very large continent , and also western europe had the advantage of having the educated people to make use of it , and working legal systems , infrastructure etc. 
  africa does n't and there are very high levels of corruption that would cause the money to go where it should n't . 
   the solution is actually pretty mundane . 
  save the people but bring them back to the shore they started from . 
  they did that in the beginning but then eu judges stopped it based on international human rights treaties and bleeding heart syndrome , so the only thing they can do is to bring them to europe . 
  europe is too constrained by human rights laws to be able to do much about mass immigration . 
  the ngo ships should be sunk and it 's sailors taken back and prosecuted as human traffickers . 
  they are the enemies of europe . 
  i like the effect of all the neon signs on the wet streets . 
  thank you , i will check at least some of them out for sure . 
  bicycle lanes are nice but i do n't really need them , in many countries i just bike next to the roads for cars because bicycle roads are missing . 
  what are your favorites ? 
  i 'm curious because i will go through the czech republic on my bicycle this summer . 
  i 've been to many european cities and prague so far is my favorite when it comes to architecture . 
  this picture does n't do it justice at all though in my opinion . 
  most dutch people even from amsterdam have never even smoked weed ... 
  it 's mostly the tourists to be honest . 
  and some of the students . 
  i 'd be curious to see this map with dates when the temperatures occurred .
