  i prefer to be a realist , being factual . 
  that said , i think being an optimist has more chance of changing the world than being a pessimist . 
  yeah , i 'm not that cynical . 
  i 'm not stupid , i know it 's definitely possible and even likely . 
  i just would like to hear what 's up , and not just assume something . 
  well , yeah , was n't saying i was surprised about the wiretapping , just that they went public . 
  i 'm interested in the reason . 
  i would n't be that cynical . 
  it 's definitely i keep in the realm of possibilities , but i do n't exclude actual ethics . 
  i 'm mostly surprised that vodafone went public with this . 
  i guess that 's a good sign concerning vodafone . 
  my primary school was christian ( ` :( ` ) , and did n't have anything like that . 
  netherlands 2 hours a week , 25 % of a year went to christianity , 25 % islam , 12.5 % judaism and 12.5 % buddhism . 
  last year was fully dedicated to philosophy . 
  the course is n't called religion - or philosophy , but something not really translatable meaning both . 
  `` levensovertuiging '', 
  they 're not very discriminatory when it comes to politicians , so no ... 
   at least 20 euros that 's to prevent you taking the train with an anonymous card , and just going everywhere for the price of a single card . 
  he had a rather large post explaining his point . 
  i count that as an actual response quite well . 
  [ indirect democracy ( representative ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/representative_democracy ) . 
  politics is full of it , because you ca n't elect everyone directly . 
  that is not possible and not something you would want . 
  he 's the dictator of a democratic party . 
  sceptical , or critical ? 
  you have to register before every vote . 
  at least in the netherlands you had to at least 6 weeks beforehand . 
  sounds like a plan !, 
  we 'll just put some dikes on the border , and have a nice little sea between nl and de , 
  that 's why the site received a bunch of criticism in / r/thenetherlands . 
  if you take down all the dikes etc right now , you already flood 1/3rd . 
  and when the see rises , we of course rise the dikes . 
  it 's already protected against certain floods and conditions . 
  because russia tries/tried to be western like the rest , and at times to have share the same values , and it 's a major part of the world . 
  many of those other countries are mostly irrelevant . 
  note this is a very crude and rough description , but it kinda works here . 
  mandatory voting is a two sided blade ... 
  sometimes it 's useful , sometimes it 's not . 
  to add to that , those remaining are also grouping together since they 're becoming a minority , increasing this echo effect . 
  you see the same effect in other minority religions . 
  that would be east . 
  right ? 
  i mean , right side ... mean ... not left . 
  whoop , seems you got some downvoting brigade after you . 
  ` -3 ` for an understandable emotion . 
  apparently i 'm german ... 
  i can live with that . 
  and closest to uk and denmark . 
  i 've never , ever heard of this . 
  the closest i 've seen was the [ nvu ( dutch peoples-union ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_peoples-union ) demonstrate . 
  they 're a nationalistic extreme-right party . 
  how does that change my point ? 
  does your information become more valuable because i can look up the relevant numbers ? 
  i 'm observing you get downvoted for saying absolutely nothing . 
   there is more slaves in the world today , than at any other time in the planets history . 
  that number is mostly irrelevant , you need to be talking about relative numbers . 
  it 's a bit ironic since it mentions the netherlands , which is second . 
  it does in a way that they want to keep their honour , their ` good ' - ness by killing the ` bad ' . 
  you call it surrender , which makes it sound negative . 
  i get it is n't all positive , and it might not be at all , but you get a lot in return , including a region which can stand much stronger facing the rest of the world . 
  over here your employer submits it . 
  it 's a reference to [ fawlty towers ] ( http://youtu.be/yfl6lu3xqw0 ), 
  just imagine drunk dutch speaking german ... * do n't mention the war !, 
  note torrents are notorious for saturating your connection in a really bad way . 
  if your connection is unstable , torrents can tip it over . 
  there are some tests online to see what content is throttled . 
  percent point i think . 
  you can read that as 1/100 . / = 10/1000 oddly enough my phone has both . 
  it was mostly `` bump bump brake bump bump brake '' . 
  it was less exciting that it looks . 
  it did n't help my camera was in my bag , so i had to be careful with the drops . 
  they were larger than it appears on the picture . 
  i posted [ somewhere else ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20eug3/eu_countries_by_the_of_people_who_answered/cg2zgpn?context=3 ) :  you mean like [ this ] ( https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qo_xrvqa5fy/uiocwwfquoi/aaaaaaaanp4/xn_rodhwo2w/w1598-h904-no/imag1454.jpg ) and [ this ] ( https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bubve-fnga4/uisa-ltzx7i/aaaaaaaan4w/0rmfk4qeq7a/w1598-h904-no/imag1647.jpg ) ? 
  cycled trough the uk last summer , found some , eh , interesting bike paths . 
  like [ this ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-77tzpbqn6eu/uir97bt3jri/aaaaaaaanjc/_5x6sf6nhzo/w524-h927-no/imag1536.jpg ) one , advertised as cycle road on the map , identical to [ this ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zbycsmcter0/uir_xb8g7ji/aaaaaaaanss/2hufa5p17vi/w1598-h904-no/imag1586.jpg ) perfect path . 
  i 'm not sure what kind of europe i meant . 
  rereading your comment i can see that interpretation , but it is n't very obvious . 
  especially when following the comment chain . 
  if you said that in your edit instead of mentioning downvotes ... , 
  i 'm pretty sure we 're talking political europe here , not geographical . 
   edit : shit , i did n't say anything negative either . 
  enter punishment . 
  you 're implying negativity and accusing him of a sentiment he has n't shown here , and is n't a subject here either . 
  you 're trying to make him take a stance , so you can attack him on that . 
  you 're like the random guy who implies that every immigrant steals by saying `` he has n't stolen , yet '' . 
  an increase detected by people living in houses , who 's houses have cracks , need to be stabilized and are otherwise worthless now . 
  the government is putting $ 1.2 billion into a damage fund . 
  which does n't cover the damages at all . 
  which in turn would require ukraine to agree with heavy reforms . 
  as far as i am aware , the amount of corruption in the system is really blocking any guarantee the eu would dare to do . 
  start out as in one of your first post . 
  you understand / r/europe very well . 
  if you post offensive , rude or otherwise stupid comments , you get downvotes . 
  and you knew it from the get go , but go on pretending that we 're all evil circlejerkers spitting on israel . 
  or not , maybe we just do n't like people who post nonconstructive , negative and rude posts . 
  edit , to back up my comment , here 's your first comment in this thread :  [ that 's great , they 'll be healthier and will more easily blow up school buses and throw rocks . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20zjvs/the_european_union_and_unicef_launched_a_project/cg87bip ) and the second  [ any reason why they did that ? 
  or is it only because they 're evil and this forum needs no explanation ? 
  ] ( r/europe/comments / 20zjvs/the _ european_union_and_unicef_launched_a_project / cg8819v ) very positive , a great way to enter a discussion . 
  the way you comment is you run in , shout all kinds of things , and then whine about people responding negatively before anything even happened .
