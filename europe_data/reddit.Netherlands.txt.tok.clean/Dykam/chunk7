  at least you 're not groningen , where until not too long ago ah was literally the only place in the city center . 
  about 6 of em . 
  same in the netherlands . 
  not sure what he was talking about . 
  even if , you 're at least going to get looked at weird . 
  why does that work ? 
  does competition not drive the price down ? 
  i understand why you 're internet providers do n't have competition , but mobile ... ? 
  hmm , we were just told to be consistent . 
  they did n't care much which of the two . 
  same for pronunciation . 
  the teacher used british , so that 's an influence , but it was n't a requirement . 
  besides which subscriptions you can and can not get , it appears there 's some minimum requirements for providers . 
  essentially , it boils down to that ( this year ) every $ 3.85 is 1gb worth ( a month ) . 
  for unlimited at home , this means your subscription , say $ 40/month , requires a provider to give you at minimum 40/3 .85 = 10.4 gb a month abroad . 
  for limited data limits or per-gb , if it boils down to your bundle being less than $ 3.85 / gb , they can surcharge you up to $ 7.70 / gb . 
  it 's not entirely clear to me whether they cap the sum at $ 7.70 , or are allowed to add $ 7.70 to the local price . 
  if someone else can help me decipher the `` national bundles with limited data '' part : [ source ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/telecoms-internet/mobile-roaming-costs/index_en.htm ) . 
  there were some similar offers here , but the subscription itself is insanely expensive . 
  you might want to explain what they are as it 's all dutch . 
  hmm here we have the middle ground for dinner , still thin , but not paper-like like a crepe . 
  while i ca n't speak for the situation , you have to frame it in a generic urban/countryside view . 
  from that perspective a lot of cities seem like typical cities with some local characteristics , but from afar berlin appears more than just that . 
  again , no expert myself , just noting that from the outside berlin seems to have a certain atmosphere other cities do n't . 
  though on the other hand it just seems like a typical `` biggest city of the country '' case , similar to respectively london , paris , amsterdam etc. 
  documentary-like things are relatively likely to jump the border , like recently tom waes 's series has been a hit . 
  do n't worry , the lad 4alre4 is trying hard to be the thread troll , pissing all over the page . 
  afaik homeless are often registered at a local homeless center or similar . 
   you 're talking in absolutes again . 
  there 's a lot of room between the current state and absolute peace . 
  you 're talking in absolutes again . 
  why do you need to know a novelist from < some country  country , just to be allowed to be called culturally curious ? 
  you can be curious without actively pursuing that curiosity . 
  there 's many things i 'm curious about , but i ca n't pursue all of them . 
  i would personally use `` open to learning about '' as a more realistic goal . 
  weird quiz , never heard of that . 
  what quiz are we playing now ? 
  to be fair , it 's not quite a village , but indeed , it 's a horrible , eh , thing , and we 're wondering how it got approved . 
  perhaps / u/idfka _ cz offered an idealistic idea of how it could work , but you 're just taking the black & white approach and assuming the alternative is the polar opposite . 
  you ca n't reach perfection without everyone participating , definitely , but you do n't have to isolate yourself entirely either . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/xuvvrpdc8sm ), 
  right , i see , that makes sense . 
  that is quite incredible . 
  why specifics the germans though , and not any of the other tribes or languages around ? 
  what 's your point ? 
  making sure the reputation of poland stays in the shitter ? 
  i 'm pondering about whether that 's beneficial or not . 
  it makes more sense and is definitely less artificial , as it tends to describe cultural areas more accurately . 
  poland had , and probably still has to a decent extend , a similar issue . 
  however somewhat recently the visual of poland kinda changed here in the netherlands , and is much more positive now . 
  it 'll take time , that 's for sure . 
  [ funny you say that ] ( http://www.tennet.eu/news/detail/tennet-presents-hub-and-spoke-concept-for-large-scale-wind-energy-on-the-north-sea/ ) . 
  i made the mistake of looking on twitter , and his twitter armies do that actually . 
  they compare their current regression to our fuckup long ago . 
  trump was ( is ) a internationally operating businessman , and now president . 
  kind of the penultimate combo requiring you to know this . 
  public also tells you how they where founded , which is by means of the government or municipality . 
  they can still be associated with either , afaik , but i am not aware of any . 
  that 's not entirely true . 
  i think this one does n't have any monitary needs , but when protests become more organised and last longer , money can help . 
  oh , right , trust in that way . 
  that 's a fair point . 
  it was n't clear whether you meant that or safety . 
  on what grounds ? 
  would you still once they 're proven to be statistically saver than humans ? 
  right now they are n't i think , not in all circumstances , but it 's getting there . 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  was being a tad facetious :p, 
   everything on rtl . 
  the only additional issue i see is the anchor thing , and as mentioned [ here ] ( http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/24561/ssltest-chain-issues-contains-anchor ) it 's merely a not-optimal error . 
  to add : the certificate is technically correct from what i gather , however it does use some outdated techniques ( sha-1 ) . 
  in case of firefox , there 's something going on , in the initial request to add the root ca in 2008 , there 's [ recent discussion ] ( https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=435736 ) . 
  we just started [ sharing part of our air force ] ( http://www.airn.nato.int/archive/2016/belgium--netherlands-to-take-turns-in-policing-benelux-airspace ) . 
  yeah , it was n't much , but enough to know they originally spoke ` dutch ' . 
  well , that helped you out of that myth . 
  while the spread of stuff like the flu and cold are correlated , not because of what they usually tell you . 
  i do n't know anyone who does n't . 
  i recall it 's part of basic curriculum . 
  but not everyone cares about history . 
  how 'd we figure it out ? 
  using country size as an excuse for anything . 
  if you can handle the inconveniences of a extremely touristy city , it 's definitely worth it . 
  different than expectations , but it 's still a city worth exploring . 
  that sounds very similar to ours , except there 's no voting in a party , you then just vote for # 1 , and the role of the monarchy has been minimized of even eliminated in this process . 
  that 's a universal problem , do n't worry . 
  that must be very regional , as during my trips in the south west and ny state i do n't remember any baggers . 
  did meet some on the west coast i think . 
  imo the difference is that in the eu cheap chocolate might be really bland , but in the us it 's the damn butyric acid fucking up most chocolate . 
  it has a charm , but i do n't think the type suited for this post . 
  it was always burning , so lets go back to how it used to be ? 
  afaik it varies . 
  usually some message that they 're poor and need to feed their children , like / u/criticalspirit mentioned . 
  it 's gotten to the point where the railways and the police issued a statement about it , what to do when you see them etc. 
  it 's apparently organized and really difficult to stop . 
  whats a vintage american soda ? 
  one with hfcs in it ? 
  what , [ this ] ( http://gawker.com/5990806/us-ban-on-kinder-surprise-eggs-finally-lifted-kinda ) ? 
  household is more formally and can include roommates etc , same as in dutch . 
  sounds like it means pretty much the same . 
  not surprising , seems to share the same origin .
