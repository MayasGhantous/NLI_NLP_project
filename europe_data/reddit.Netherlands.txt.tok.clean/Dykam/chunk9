  i do n't know how people think they can properly understand and feel the local culture when they spent less than half a week in a place . 
  as someone who 's been on multiple trips to cities , i lose at least one day to travel and one day going to random places around town . 
  then on the third day i understand the city more and are able to enjoy the unique things about it , rather than just the touristic highlights . 
  if anything , they 're different . 
  one is about health under high consumption ( doh ) , the other is about authenticity ( source name , natural minerals , method of bottling , etc ), 
  that 's not what i meant though . 
  regulations on tap are that they have to be drinkable ( to whatever degree is regulated ) . 
  i explicitly mentioned mineral and spring rather than bottled , as bottled indeed is generally the same as tap , but the former two have some stricter regulations people might care about . 
  there 's regulations on ( at least here ) spring and mineral water , and in a lot of places it 's definitely better than tap . 
  not that it warrants buying it , but depending on where you are the difference can be pretty big . 
   the flemish are incomprehensible , even though we speak the same language . 
  ironically there 's a decent amount of areas in the netherlands which for the average dutchman is less comprehensible than most flemish . 
  sounds like a combination is the best solution . 
  foldable as a default , and when budget allows go fancy with a rented bike . 
  which does require you to come back where you rented the bike and left the foldable , but that 's ok . 
  it worked for you as it already cached when you loaded it without hotlinking . 
  obviously i was stating it in the context of  granted , going from texas to oregon is culturally a whole different country which i take as a statement that the cultural differences are similar to those in europe across countries . 
  which i then refute by saying that the points you raise are last-to-mention when comparing cultural differences here . 
   yes , we used to buy fuel in holland when it was cheaper there , also several holidays in austria  welp , the fuel prices did a 180 and now we 're buying german oil . 
  just the sheer fact you 're quibbling about the same laws , and consider strength-of-religion a measure of cultural difference , means the rest is so uniform that you do n't even realise it . 
  those are kinda the last things you end up talking about when comparing cultural differences between countries . 
  i disagree . 
  it represents a strongly polarized view , dominated by economical entities . 
   have you actually taken them up on that promise or do they just promise it ? 
  it 's not a promise , they 're legally bound to it and it 's entirely in their interest to follow up on it . 
  it 's based on a cost/risk analysis , and apparently this ended up cheaper than pin-related fraud , which is n't really covered . 
   when you 're buying the paper from the homeless street vendors who unlike the ones in sweden ( according to the ny times article ) have n't started ccarrying around card readers . 
  partially because it kinda looks out of place . 
  a homeless holding an expensive device . 
  basically , yeah . 
  it was announced as alternative to cheque and cash money . 
  here 's an old [ ( dutch ) advertisement video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rppw22vgjxc ) promoting it , but it 's , ehm , easy to understand . 
  it 's definitely more left-wing , but personally it 's kinda hard to judge how much as it 's only comparable to / r/europe . 
  spoken with a lot of americans , and heritage comes up a lot . 
  that said , her thoughts about how safe it is fit jews are a but surprising , i mainly meant it 's not too unusual someone emphasises so much on their heritage . 
   like who the fuck would know or care ? 
  in the us there 's culturally a lot more emphasis on heritage , op 's post is n't very surprising to me . 
  i like to use https://www.hipmunk.com/ , used it for all my flights last summer . 
  / r/thenetherlands, 
  to get you started : http://www.lofotr.no/en/practical-info/how-to-get-here ctrl + f evenes http://www.lofoten.info/en/bus, 
  note that it 's rather rare for those to be ran by kids . 
  it happens , but not a whole lot . 
  a bit more common is drinking stands during [ koningsdag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koningsdag ) , but that 's only once a year . 
  you 're talking about the us and eu like the only thing there is about it is how states work . 
  like there is no cultural difference , other political differences , etc. 
  i do n't see how that is related to the question ... 
  the question can be about anything , not just the state-system . 
  i 'm curious why 'd you select oostende . 
  i 'm not very familiar with it , but afaik it 's not one of the prime touristic spots . 
  i hardly see iso 8601 used outside of it . 
  i am aware of iso 8601 . 
  i was n't talking about what we should use , but what we are using . 
  do n't we generally use a hyphen ? 
  which often tells me whether a date is american or european style . 
  i think you need to mention what countries and tracks you are planning to visit . 
  there is no single rail , it 's different everywhere . 
  quite often a bunch of sites do the same thing in a different way . 
  nsinterational is the international version of ns 's travel site , but there 's also e.g. 
  belgiums version : https://www.b-europe.com/travel , which appears functionally similar in use . 
  just keep in mind that a lot of city ( centers ) can be a hell by car . 
  preferably avoided , often cities have parking lots outside the city with public transportation right next to it . 
  only need my university card when delivering the exam answers to the examiner , but that 's about it . 
  utrecht university . 
  well maestro is ( mostly ? ), 
  the debit card system , whereas mastercard and visa are creditcard . 
   1 ) does this mean that i am essentially losing 27 cents on every euro i spend ? 
  you need to see it as a trade . 
  i give you 20 sheep for your 50 chickens . 
  this does not mean you 're losing 30 chickens because you only get 20 sheep . 
  it also works the other way , for those 20 sheeps you get 50 chickens back . 
  that said , there 's usually some fee involved in the transaction . 
  as in , if we do the trade , you only get 18 sheep , i keep 10 % aside as fee . 
  and when you trade back , you only get 44 chickens . 
  so yes , there is some loss in trading in money , but not the way you thought it was . 
   2 ) does your money take you further in europe than it would in the us ? 
  really depends where you are , depends on the country , depends on the area , depends on the good you get . 
  you got ta be more specific . 
   3 ) would you recommend carrying actual money , or is it as common in europe as it in the us to use debit / credit cards for eating out etc. ? 
  again , depends on the country . 
  over in the netherlands debit cards can be used everywhere ( if compatible ) , but that 's not the case everywhere . 
  having cash on you is smart , but do n't go excessive . 
  just make sure to check if you can use the local atm machines and your daily limits , to keep money for a few days on hand . 
   4 ) i 've read that it 's definitely better to just wait until you 've landed in europe to exchange your money than it is to exchange it in the us the most likely chance for exchange offices to be found are airports and train stations . 
  but again , if you can use an atm that 's usually the cheapest from my experience . 
  in that case fee depends on your bank and the bank controlling the atm . 
   5 ) is there anything special i should know about the pound for when i am in london ? 
  it 's not the euro ? 
  it 's a coin like anything else , just only usable in the uk ... 
  same rules apply . 
  there are thousands and thousands , and i fear there are no central lists . 
  i think your best bet is doing an inquiry for the appropriate instances in each country . 
  some ` cyclepaths ' are pretty funny ... 
  that said ... 
  i had a great time in the peak district , i left on my [ ( t ) rusty bike ] ( https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_u7ezkqk-24/uimd5bg8s2i/aaaaaaaavne/oa6x64kzrbu/w1630-h922-no/imag1404.jpg ) , went trough [ tunnels ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bqpvxtfqw1k/uir8xqqz8vi/aaaaaaaavoy/lpszlrlojzg/w1630-h922-no/imag1498.jpg ) , along [ canals ] ( https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gtlcwa85lyi/uiodg3bd0ei/aaaaaaaavno/irxi8vrtgqk/w1630-h922-no/imag1466.jpg ) , past [ lakes ] ( https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fnmoxgykvxq/uioerzh55li/aaaaaaaavn8/umnhgsbxyzy/w1630-h922-no/imag1476.jpg ) and some [ quality cyclepaths ] ( https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zbycsmcter0/uir_xb8g7ji/aaaaaaaavkg/qiyxn09g2-g/w1630-h922-no/imag1586.jpg ) , and i slept in some [ beautiful buildings ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xu0kisozmso/uir-cjij5fi/aaaaaaaavl0/zdq09hfgfyu/w1630-h922-no/imag1557.jpg ) . 
  that tunnel was [ slightly eery ] ( https://youtu.be/6asyiafnfpc ) . 
  bike brofist !, 
  seems denmark and the netherlands have very similar cultures , but since there 's no border being shared it 's not being acknowledged much . 
  i think that 's a good point . 
  while success might have roughly the same definition , the care for success is much less . 
  i just leave them :p,
