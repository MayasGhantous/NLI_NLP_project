  save and preserve russia !, 
  those who love russia , they love god . 
  russia , holy russia - it is a nostalgia for the divine justice and the kingdom of god on earth . 
  in the holy russia , just like in a mirror , spiritual heavens and the kingdom of heaven are reflected . 
  russia will be saved . '', 
  quick translation of the brown part of the text . 
  just because his solution is not going to be 100 % effective it does not render it useless . 
  on the contrary , if we deport 100k of migrants who do not deserve an asylum ( pakistanis for example ) , and prevent one death of an innocent person , i say we did good . 
  you are welcome to look for the silver bullet , but until you find it , i say that / u/szkwarek 's ideas are a good start . 
  i must admit that was one of the most ethereal places i have ever been to !, 
  the deep grove with the palm trees , the menhirs and the little stream . 
  just magical !, 
  i plan to go back with the gf and rent that windmill on the south side of the island for a week or so . 
  did you go to the botanical garden on the ile de batz ? 
  so is nice and montpelier and burgundy and and and ... . 
  i loved the area around roscoff , can not wait to go back to ile de batz !, 
  and the crepes are the bomb !, 
  the further west you go , the better it becomes . 
  roscoff and ile de batz are just breathtaking . 
  i appreciate you realizing how bad racial profiling can be . 
  i get pissed off at the people talking bad about `` white males '' being the holders of power in the world and i am like wtf , where is my power !!!, 
  now i can not even begin to imagine how would i react if cops kept on picking me out from the crowd for no reason other than the color of my skin . 
  if i had to chose only one , i would go for france : france has brittany !, 
  but that is a hard effin ' choice indeed !, 
   also , why is profiling bad ? 
  you sound like someone who has never been profiled . 
  man i fuckin ' love france . 
  the food , the people , the landscapes ... everything . 
  i think we are doing a fuckin ' good damn job it it too !, 
  got it . 
  tell that to the civilians in aleppo who have been massacred by your own iranian troops , ayatollah . 
  i am sorry my french friend , you do not get to absolve france from what its ' many governments did in the middle east , all the way down to sykes - picot . 
  sputnik is kremlin-based drivel that is spewing propaganda . 
  i 'd say a combo would be even better , start with the immigration stop and kick out those who have a criminal record and no dutch citizenship . 
  an example must be made before they get too cocky . 
  look what russians did in the us elections , i would not be too surprised if turkey tries to pull off some sheisty stuff . 
  i 'd say get rid of those that do not have nl citizenship and have only turkish one alongside a criminal record . 
  there should be a few thousands of those and their deportation will serve as a shot across their bow . 
  the worst thing is not to do anything and remain passive , that will only encourage erdogan 's interference in the internal matters of nl . 
  please provide reliable sources about such deportation of sizable quantity of turkish citizens out of the netherlands . 
  the guys tito ordered offed were no angels and done fucked up things . 
  good on him !, 
  in that case , lead by example and do not post in nl-related topics and delete all previous ones . 
  sounds like a good time to deport those who are not citizens and who have a criminal record , that way they know it is serious . 
  rekt !!!, 
  i am happy to see that my benevolent influence has improved your spelling skills . 
  now , you have a great day and have fun learning in school , bud . 
  i appreciate your newfound orthographic perfection . 
  if your political and historical skills were as easy to upgrade , now that would be somethin' to behold . 
  people who live in glass houses should n't throw stones . 
   bric russia : international pariah with a collapsing economy . 
  china : an increasingly authoritarian state with a depressed economy . 
  brazil : a perennial epitome of corruption and poverty . 
  india : they are us ally now . 
   um , please red for yourself , it would do you good because youre uneducated enough to refer to yugoslav wars as balkan wars it is `` read '' , `` you 're '' and `` yugoslav '' . 
  also , there should be a period at the end of your sentence . 
  now , what were you saying about uneducated ? 
  it is spelled fort knox . 
  prove it . 
  here , let me remind you of your own , 15 hrs old words : `` bric nations '' . 
  have a great day and stay out of rain . 
   no , really . 
  i am just being honest , ass hat . 
  / u/noinspi2 , at least you did not throw kankerlijer at me . 
  `` you shall know them by the company they keep . '', 
  you should stop chasing your own tail , you are already all convoluted and miles away from the original argument . 
   sooo lets get to it : a dutch , stop right there and look at my flair . 
  second , i could not care less about debating your revisionism with you . 
  have a good one . 
  i can say whatever i please , freedom of speech son . 
  and yeah , quite a few dutch love to use the good ol' `` oh i am just being honest '' as an excuse to be rude . 
  your contest of it is a proof of your inability to see the forest for the trees . 
   why is croatia wasting money on weapons ? 
   the part or croatia that was taken by serbia as a result of military victory thank you for answering your own question . 
   so why are they doing it ? 
  russia is short on friends and is trying to gain as many as possible . 
  serbia is being used by russia for russian purposes which might not be in serbia 's best interest . 
   why is the us giving the croats weapons ? 
  the us is supplying croatian armed forces as a part of nato pact , it is not `` giving weapons to croats '' . 
  croatia accessed the nato , so they get supplies from the us . 
  lmao at your divination of the meaning of my words and the denial of historical facts . 
  what i am saying is that serbia should focus on building positive and constructive relationships with its ' neighbors and forego wasting money on weapons . 
  do you really think russia is going to give you guys anything for free ? 
  that the kremlin is giving you their weapons out of the goodness of their cocks ? 
  hell , it took a croatian to kick the russians out of belgrade last time they came in . 
  i think that you have worse relations with kosovo . 
  also , why waste money on the armed forces and weapons , it 's not like they did you guys any good whatsoever - serbia lost every single balkan war of the 1990s that it was involved in . 
  if you join nato , you will get donations too . 
  and yes , that would mean another thing from the past that serbia has to come to terms with . 
  maybe serbia should ** really ** let go of the past and focus on the future . 
  oh no , you are just rude . 
  i have been living here in the nl for half a decade and dutch do not like to hear the truth any more than any other peoples in the world . 
  this is just a cute excuse to be rude . 
  lmao !, 
  either that or albania vetoes kosovo . 
  ** croatia ** : ~ 4.3 m people , its ' armed forces are ranked 51st in the world , military expenditures over last 5 years range from 1.77 % ( 2011 ) to 1.38 % ( 2015 ) . 
  gdp : $ 91.1 b.
