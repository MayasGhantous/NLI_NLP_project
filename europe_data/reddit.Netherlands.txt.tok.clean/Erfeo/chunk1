first gained independence from spain after a mostly protestant uprising in the 1500s led by william ` the silent ' of orange , the father of the nation . 
  he is our george washington . 
  protestants like william of orange , an influential nobleman , were n't granted the same rights as catholics by the spanish king . 
  this resulted in an uprising . 
  i think that 's a bit too simply put . 
  firstly , william never publicly converted , historians are n't 100 % sure what he really believed . 
  secondly , the revolution started in the eastern provinces which were predominantly catholic . 
  in the early republic only about 60 % of the total population was protestant . 
  of course religious unrest was an important part of the revolution but it does n't explain it all . 
  more then anything the dutch did n't like being ruled by a far away monarch whose centralizing policies were in conflict with their traditional rights and privileges . 
  again ? 
  this post pretty much sums up the problem . 
   maybe the dutch monarchy has not been volatile and are actually good people with sound values and useful , but who knows how it could play out into the future ? 
  it may even make them easy targets or subjecting them to extreme stress . 
  i do n't see your point . 
  if the monarch ca n't full fill his office any more , our government would continue functioning without skipping a beat . 
  yes , there may come a time when we want to do away with the monarchy , but why should that be a reason to do away with it * now ? 
  if i was spanish , i 'd probably be a republican . 
  but i 'm not , and i do n't see how their problems relate to our monarchy . 
   that you lot were ** all ** in favour of 'til now , it stinks . 
  but that 's the thing . 
  the political forces that pushed for the current accord were never a proponent of austerity , neither domestic nor foreign . 
  umm ... no ? 
  you are trying to redefine the word ` economy ' to make a point . 
  the economy is more then stock markets , it encompasses the wealth and resources of ** all ** people , not just the wealthy . 
  because what we are trying to do is stabilize the economy , not upset it . 
  and i agree with that . 
  questioning the fundaments of our economic and financial system should be left to a time when we have a better grip on things , it 's just common sense . 
  but of course , * then * no one is interested . 
  that also includes nightly frost though , so that does n't always mean the roads are actually slippery on those days . 
  the cpc frowns on a lot of things , but copyright infringement ? 
  not so much . 
  that 's really horrible but if a white guy murdered his wife or raped a teenager it would n't be posted here . 
  i do n't know about portugal but the most commonly proposed infrastructure project is about connecting western european harbours with the eastern european hinterlands . 
  lots of businesses can profit from that . 
  bringing back manufacturing to the south is a great idea but easier said then done . 
  just tax cuts would n't be enough , there would also need to be large wage cuts for them to be even remotely competitive . 
  factories are closing all over europe , why would they come back in the south ? 
  yeah , i ca n't blame you . 
  oh right , i forget i was in / r/europe . 
  the only place where you can say ` caliphate of eurabia ' and people ca n't tell if you 're being sarcastic or not . 
  making these posts is the only way to prevent the caliphate of eurabia from happening . 
  true story . 
  estonia : metsat\u00f6ll - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc3q9q4crza france : ez3kiel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heddwgs87ae and of course loads of metal bands from scandinavia and the uk, 
  most , if not all , citizens of the vatican are ordained priests so they ca n't be married either . 
  the whole age of consent law is practically useless since no one is supposed to have sex of any kind there . 
  maybe ` accepting it ' is n't the right way of putting it , ` being used to it ' is probably more fitting . 
  the push to bar non-residents from coffeeshops was never really intended for amsterdam but more for smaller towns in the south and east . 
  apparently , they experience germans and belgians who come there to buy as a nuisance . 
  while amsterdammers accept crazy tourists as a fact of life . 
  that 's really neat and all but what does this have to do with europe ? 
  i know right ? 
  instead of selling the tanks the military does n't use anymore , we should just turn them into ambulances . 
  two flies in one smack !, 
  i wish i did n't know what you are talking about . 
  what ? 
  the eu was the most important issue of this election . 
  yes , it does . 
  give it a rest . 
  no of course not , that would be horrible !, 
  we just ostracise its adherents from the general society until we deport them at first opportunity . 
   vandalism that means we can also deport white , christian petty criminals . 
  after all , most of the people you are aiming at here are second generation ( no country would give residence permits to convicted illegals ) , so what would separate them ? 
   violence and inciting violence well obviously we deal with the actual terrorists , no one is on the other side of that issue . 
   all countries have the right to secure their own borders . 
  muslims have no divine right to move to european countries . 
  no one is claiming otherwise . 
   saudi arabia and some other arab countries rigidly exclude jews , and any non-jew who has an israeli visa in his passport . 
  i do n't think they are in a moral position to complain about countries that place restrictions on muslim immigrants . 
  how is this relevant at all ? 
  you think the saudi king is lobbying to get arabs a european nationality ? 
  if anything arab leaders want their people back , if they care at all . 
  it seems you have a poor understanding of the problem at hand , are you even european ? 
  `` a witty saying proves nothing . '', 
  i definitely see what you mean . 
  but part of the problem is that we view it here on reddit , without context . 
  because we do n't have context , we might assume this video is going to convey an objective overview . 
  this would n't be a problem for the subscribers of that channel , who subscribe exactly because they like the channel 's viewpoint . 
  you have a valid complaint , but i do n't think they are consciously deceiving us or something edit : it seems talktoeu is n't just a youtuber but a part of a eu-funded campaign to promote the eu in ireland . 
  that changes things . 
  i agree , this line of reasoning might sound slightly paranoid right now , but we have to think of the future . 
  europe is quite comfortable with the current scene of global politics but this could very well change this century . 
  i believe his comital grace is showing us the ways of his people . 
  edit : or ... not ? 
  ye gods , you 're right . 
  there 's always at least one . 
  or better yet , ditch rutte . 
  i 'll never get why people think he has the competency to be premier . 
  except it logically should be a standard option , given how influential social democracy is in europe . 
  republican could make perfect sense as long as you see it as the opposite of monarchist . 
  however this is probably not what the maker intended seeing as democratic is also an option . 
  also the ratings are kind of silly . 
  rate the imf , what does that mean ? 
  are you asking if i support its existence ? 
  or if i agree with its current policies ? 
  same for the ` european super state ' , it 's a rather complex idea to sum up in a 1-5 rating . 
  i wonder if this will yield anything useful . 
  funny you should mention christianity , as all the christian parties voted * against * this particular law . 
  pvv voters would probably say yes . 
  the most misguided of those truly believe in wilders ' lies about the muslims taking over the country ( the european caliphate as he calls it ) .
