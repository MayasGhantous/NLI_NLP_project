  individual countries comparing themselves to the eu , probably not . 
  the eu comparing themselves to the past : probably . 
  it accurately represents the economic power that was gained/lost ( for as much as gdp ever was an indicator of that ) . 
  a megabyte of text is quite a lot , actually . 
  you can store a small book in a megabyte ... 
   might be confusing for people who do n't know what we 're trying to escape from ... \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  it 's because of the ungodly aquariums we call coffee mugs here . 
  they can have like 2-3 times the volume of an espresso cup . 
  how 's the trembling these days ? 
  you only need to escape one because then the system no longer sees a text surrounded by those symbols ( because it only recognizes 1 symbol for that purpose ) . 
  but that 's why you need 3 slashes : \u00af \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af to display \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af because if you type \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af it wil look like \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af ( and you typed \u00af \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af which showed as \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af ( and i had to put a linebreak there or else i would have had to escape even more underscores ) ), 
  you need to escape the underscore as well . 
  your version is missing the upper arms . 
   however , no individual should be immune from prosecution in the first place that 's why it was lifted so easily . 
  the immunity was in place to prevent harassment by the police/law . 
  it 's a failsafe so that the current ruling party ca n't abuse their power . 
  for ` normal ' stuff , the failsafe gets lifted ( let 's not get into the discussion that it was a weird law that she got prosecuted for ) . 
  i guess there usually really are real world counter examples to silly jokes  no but seriously , you are right . 
  but those are likely not a large group , either absolutely or relatively . 
  nor is it as funny as i tried to be :p, 
  yes , but then they would n't be stealing the honest and hard-working taxpayers ' jobs . 
  he put quotation marks around the word wasted , and his sentence was definitely different . 
  i have a problem with your use of ` literally ' . 
  ( for example , you did n't acknowledge the ` huge ' part of cars and houses ), 
  it was definitely the schr\u00f6dinger immigrant that did this . 
  they are both here to steal your job and to leech on your welfare . 
   [ the economist brexit bill ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21716629-bitter-argument-over-money-looms-multi-billion-euro-exit-charge-could-sink-brexit ) got ya fam . 
  his k/d is probably better . 
  more like 2rd if you 're actually keeping count . 
  to be fair , you do sound kinda smug even though what you say is n't wrong or anything . 
  i 'm sure you could say what you want to say in another tone and have less people downvote you . 
  apart from that , i 'm a fan as well  dissenting voices are always good for a discussion . 
  brexit is a bit of a circlejerk sometimes and it 's good that other points of view are heard as well . 
  ggggggggggggg, 
  https://youtube.com/watch?v=vcucyffihks our political satire program had a go at trump  edit : do n't worry , only the first 20 seconds are dutch , the actual piece is english . 
  [ a dutch radiomaker even parodied it with swedish words . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlokbik_nxe ), 
  indonesia was left with its own culture because we were just trading with them , and were n't really busy with converting them to christianity and stuff . 
  that 's why spanish is everywhere :p, 
  we 're a trading country . 
  and as nobody wants to learn dutch because it 's hard and there are n't too many of us , we decided that we needed to speak other languages . 
  pretty much everybody speak english here , and our language and day-to-day speech borrows a lot of words from english . 
  also dutch and english share a common germanic root ( even though english is like 40 % roman ), 
  [ it 's from a popular summer song a few years back .

  maybe they were sent there to protect the state . 
  but the whole point of this post was to show that they are still humans that care about other humans . 
  if pvv wins and gets the majority together with vvd , we 'll see some serious talking i 'm sure . 
  you 're -1700 km tall ? 
  the laws of nature !, 
   but that 's no excuse to pretend it 's not there look at this guys !, 
  he 's trying to be * reasonable * ... get him !, 
  i thought the netherlands was already fully covered in 4g ? 
  for $ 8,50 monthly contract ( no 2-year minimum ) i get : 100 minutes of calling 50 texts 500mb of 3g ( no deals with companies i do n't use ) $ 0.10 per mb if i go over . 
  i 'm kinda jealous of you , but it 's fine . 
  and i never go over this package anyway , i use mostly wifi and i never text/call . 
  actually i checked if they had any better deals and i now pay $ 5,50 for that package !, 
  they have a $ 2 fee if i want 4g with that . 
  they previously did n't even offer that for my package . 
  still kinda jealous . 
  about as many as comments here ... 
  i thought that was n't possible for turks ? 
  ass to trout !, 
  written by a dutch guy !, 
  we 've gone full circle ... 
  the way i understood it is that ( modern ) english is a german-root language with 40 % roman loanwords . 
  now we are just looking at the german half . 
  maybe it 's mainly used by all the ninja squirrels ? 
  how do you fit that in his moving mouth when dubbing that ? 
  they have jumped _ off _ the roof ? 
  ah yes , because your comment certainly is a prime example of being open for dialogue . 
  then why did n't they go with the tower of london ? 
  or the tower bridge ? 
  they went with the big ben . 
  should have just gone for the coliseum for rome or whatever . 
   these other guys are doing it so it 's fine for me to do it . 
  / r/shitamericanssay actually exists . 
  damn , what 's the story behind this monstrosity ? 
  there is a followup question where the drained water is dumped on mars and how that would look . 
  we conquer mars as well :p, 
   dictatorship has its upsides , folks !, 
  i still rather not have it though , thanks . 
  and i hope you guys get through it as well ... 
  so basically you 're saying that you 're gon na blame the eu for companies raising their prices whether or not they had anything to do with that . 
  because they are n't making any more costs . 
  of course they can still be dicks and raise prices regardless . 
  they could even raise prices and say it is because of this . 
  but that would n't be true . 
  you said yourself that eu laws have protected you so far . 
  maybe have some faith . 
  there is no sources . 
  they said they only asked for fees because the foreign providers asked for fees ( and they asked foreign users of their own network for fees as well ) . 
  the new laws prohibit these fees . 
  what are you basing you assumption that prices are rising on ? 
  the only reason this cost money was because the providers made deals with each other about the fees that this would cost . 
  those fees are abolished . 
  your provider has to pay less now , so that the people generating those fees do n't have to pay them any more as well . 
  as a user who does not use this feature , there was no danger of ever paying extra for it . 
  and there wo n't be in the future , in the very least because they 'd rather charge the people that are abusing the situation . 
  and also because there still is a competitive market .
