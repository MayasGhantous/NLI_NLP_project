[ some footage of it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nrllhwhq7w ) that is great , he is awesome for following through on it . 
  i read his comment as sarcasm , not sure if i think too highly of them or not . 
  to me it also kinda defies the purpose of nature photography . 
  trying to capture the beauty of nature , but meh not really let 's photoshop it . 
  almost every time i read stupid stuff online about ridiculous things happening elsewhere in the world , like female rapists not getting charged for rape because they are women , americans protesting gay marriage , abortions , euthanization , etc. 
  it makes me really appreciate my country . 
  i suspect this to have a huge sampling bias . 
  people who vote no are way more eager to cast their votes . 
  i like the simple flags the best , netherlands , finland , england , estonia , czech , russia . 
  and i dislike yellow in a flag , or too complex designs , so probably catalonia . 
  do n't really like uk , macedonia , greece or germany either . 
  i can get so upset over this . 
  they rejected the proposition against unsedated slaughter here because it was conflicting with the right of freedom of religion . 
  i do n't get why religion ( in this case ) can be used as an reason/excuse for doing otherwise illegal and morally rejectable things . 
  ( unsedated slaughter * is * illegal here , unless it 's religious slaughter ), 
  you say that like the people want something else . 
  put a candidate up that only tells the truth , not a single lie , everything backed up by facts , reasons , and rationality . 
  then put them up against somebody who promises them the world . 
  who claims to have all the answers . 
  who is more focused on charisma than facts . 
  now watch who will win . 
  the biggest problem with politics is that a lot of people are ignorant , shortsighted , and prefer charisma over boring reason . 
  lower class john with his shitty paying job and minimal education does n't even know what nuclear fusion is and why it should be funded , he just wants a raise himself . 
   breaking : trump wins pennsylvania . 
  @ap race call at 1:36 a.m. est. 
  #election 2016 #apracecall i guess that 's it ? 
  eu : manpower active personnel 1,423,097 ( 2014 ) budget $ 194.7 billion ( 2014 ) rus : active personnel 771,000 ( 2016 ) [ 1 ] ( ranked 5th ) reserve personnel 2,000,000 [ 2 ] budget $ 65.6 billion, 
  2 steps forwards , 60 years of steps back . 
  seeing as climate change is the biggest threat the whole planet faces , having a climate change denier in the office really scares me . 
  we 've already surpassed a point we should n't have passed , and trump is planning on burning more oil . 
  maybe we will see some increase in trade with asia if the usa is going to give up on trading with both asia and europe ? 
  watching abc , they 're doing great . 
  but on the livestream thread on reddit those tweets keep showing up in the feed . 
  also , anyone else really annoyed by news channel tweeting shit like breaking : trump wins xx while it 's only a projection, 
  yeah it does n't look good , but that thing is a bit wonky . 
  it really comes down to michigan and wisconsin . 
  both of which trump has a small lead , with 40 % and 30 % votes left to go . 
  whyy, 
  `` trump 's lead to michigan has gone down to only 15k votes . '', 
  there is hope, 
  any chance you 're willing to rectify it , now that europe may need to band together more closely ? 
  well if everything else goes to shit , at least i 'm really improving my geographical knowledge on which state is which . 
  nope , sorry . 
  i mean hey , at least trump honors the second amendement , in case you might need it under his reign !, 
  i want to cry that this still happens . 
  where just saying `` im going to make it great again '' without any substance , and blackmailing your opponent with made up claims is still an effective method ... 
  might as well be proud of it . 
  people putting you down for enjoying a certain type of music are petty . 
  why is it so hard to understand different people have different tastes and that most people actually enjoy popular music ? 
  just because you do n't like it does n't mean other people ca n't . 
  i like most popular music . 
  it 's well produced and easy to process . 
  i like other music as well , bite me . 
  life pro tip : let other people enjoy the music they want . 
  nobody cares about your opinion , sorry . 
  it 's no secret psychology studies concepts that are more difficult to measure . 
  but if anything , that should be a compliment towards the researchers . 
  every science makes mistakes . 
  every science has replication issues . 
  this circlejerk about how psychology is not a real science is nothing more than smug people trying to show others how ` superior ' they are . 
  it 's a science in every sense of the word . 
  and a very important and relevant one to people 's lives at that . 
  so just the same old repeated misguided arguments , nothing new . 
  do you even know anything about actual psychology or do you just enjoy talking out of your ass because that 's what everybody else does as well ? 
   but him killing people does n't really speak for him being a real german with german values , does it ? 
  because germans never killed anyone ? 
  him being iranian is n't a problem . 
  people saying he was n't a true german , but an iranian , and that explains why he killed people ; that 's the problem . 
  ah yes , i almost forgot merkel was like `` hey , you know what i want to do , pick up refugees from the middle east !, 
  '' , instead of trying to deal with a humanitarian crisis . 
  thanks for showing me the light . 
  i still think we would all benefit from having some extra visible information . 
  it would be good to easily see if there was sugar added to products that you really do n't expect it in . 
  it is here , but that really is n't visible enough in practice . 
  you 're not going to read every label on every product in the supermarket . 
  especially on things like bread , because who expects there to be sugar in bread ? 
  ~ ~ his * feelings * . ~ ~ edit : he admitted his wrong , fair enough .

  this is one of the reasons i love my country . 
  we also allow for people to check their drugs , to reduce drug related deaths . 
  you 're not going to prevent people from taking drugs if they really want to , so the least you can do is try to not let people kill themselves . 
  if you want an answer to that , it 's because most people lack nuance . 
  just like ` hopefully more mosques to follow ' is totally open for interpretation . 
  he could 've meant it either way . 
  do n't say something vague and interpretable . 
  say exactly what you mean , nuances included . 
  there 's no way for others to know what exactly you mean unless you tell them . 
  everything else is interpretation . 
  and let 's please not start an argument about whose interpretation is the right one . 
  there are numerous xenophobes on this sub . 
  if you type a message that can be interpreted as such , you ca n't blame others for indeed doing so . 
  also , a personal annoyance . 
  we also ca n't talk about why some muslim men turn into terrorists and most do n't , because the right just shuts it down immediately for being ` apologists ' . 
  so it definitely goes both ways . 
  i 'm considering unsubscribing from this sub . 
  any comment that is n't hating on islam is downvoted , regardless of the message . 
  they now somehow find a way to argue against labeling things as mental illness because it places a label on it that does n't fully explain the behavior . 
  yet are still totally fine with labeling it at islam . 
  this sub is just turning into a hate spewing racist place .
