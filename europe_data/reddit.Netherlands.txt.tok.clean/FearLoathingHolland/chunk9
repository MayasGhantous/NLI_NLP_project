  not if you care about how history judges you , then you 'd definitely be on the winning side, 
  are you serious ? 
  no , opinion sections do not have to stick purely to facts as they are used for * opinions * . 
  every newspaper has them , it is clearly labelled for what it is , and people enjoy reading the opinions of well-informed people whether you agree with them or not . 
  being upfront about the fact that it 's an opinion section is a must , but when it is labelled there is nothing wrong with that . 
  i 'm dutch so when it comes to this type of shit , i would n't trade with any country , 
  do you people need to fucking comment with this shit on every post talking about germany ? 
  the fact that gays are not allowed to marry in germany is honestly mind boggling to me . 
  i just simply do n't expect that from germany . 
  yes , because i only read shit in bolds . 
  no , but they were constantly accused of similar things back in the day by people that are unable to think with any sort of nuance , attributing all members of their group with either made up morally repugnant characteristics or generalising the actions of extremist to all in order to justify the preconceived bigotry and hatred of people like you . 
  so yeah , still a pretty good comparison . 
  p.s. , how are refugees not victims https://www.google.nl/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-attacks-germany-ten-angela-merkel-hate-crime-a7600616.html%3famp https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/casualties_of_the_syrian_civil_war, 
  whatever allows your confirmation bias to properly protect your world view, 
  dozens of floats , mocking everyone including merkel , putin , erdogan and 2 on ... trump !, 
  yeah we are totally obsessed with you !, 
  ** writing in bold makes everything true ** ** i will win the lottery ** ** ?????? 
  yeah it 's total shit dude . 
  went to work this morning , the train was delayed . 
  so i stand there , smoking a fag , and suddenly bam surprise rape . 
  get to the doctor , got ta check for hiv right , walk out after being declared clean , bam , another surprise rape . 
  so i 've got to go back in ... 
  took me a good two hours to get to work today , what with being raped 5 times and shit . 
  no jews , not gassing no gays , no homophobia no women , no rapes no politicians , no assassinations see how stupid your logic is . 
  and before some trumpkin yankee starts shouting that this is n't a real problem : https://www.google.nl/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-attacks-germany-ten-angela-merkel-hate-crime-a7600616.html%3famp, 
  you 've got to fucking love threads that reach / r/all . 
  jesus christ dude the butthurt is unbelievable , it 's like satire is something non europeans are n't exposed to enough, 
  the fact that you actually believe he 's going to benefit you is pretty sad . 
  i would laugh but i just pity you for the rude awakening when trump fucks up your economy , and the working man is going to feel that the most . 
  yes , that 's exactly what i was saying . 
  if only we had some international , europe orientated governmental body whose primary function is regulating the market . 
  come on dude , we did something about ireland and apple , and we will do something about this . 
  i know that i benefit from these tax break for international companies , but if everyone did it we 'd be fucked . 
  yeah let 's start a race to the bottom where the only winners are rich multinationals , while our state budgets shrink and their wealth explodes and we , the civilians , can pay for everything while they hoard their money . 
  great fucking idea , mate . 
  that does n't contradict what was said above . 
  they break the law , which inherently means they are subject to it , otherwise what they do/did would be legal and they could n't break it . 
  yeah , exactly . 
  pretty universal saying , probably , because everyone thinks like this to some extent . 
  thing is china is far away and not really a threat to our ( non-economic ) security , so people are less inclined to make moral judgements about them and the money is good . 
  in dutch we call it a ` ver van mijn bed verhaal ' , or far from my bed story , meaning people do n't really give a fuck when shit happens on the other side of the planet when there is stuff going on here . 
  not saying i do n't agree with you , i do . 
  just trying to give my opinion on why people care less for china 's crimes than russia 's . 
  sure thing dude , whatever you say, 
  yes , it does . 
  it 's a symbolic issue , which is important if you want to actually be accepting of people . 
  maybe we have the resources and responsibility to tackle all idiots that want to kill innocent people . 
  expecting that the * president of the united states * has a better grasp of geopolitical and economical matters than redditors now counts as deep ... 
  okay then . 
  you 're right , it 's because i have a low income ( student ) so it 's subsidised , which does take the pressure of it for poor people, 
  that 's a lot of money to me . 
  i pay 240 euro 's a year , and the worst thing that could happen would cost me another 300 . 
  12,000 would be a lot to someone making only 30,000 or something a year, 
  i 've never been to america so what i 'm going to say is purely based on online interactions and media representations . 
  with that said , it seems to me that a lot of americans feel that not being ` forced ' to pay for health care or others ' education is a sort of freedom , failing to understand that indirectly they are still paying for it only not through taxes . 
  i would argue that the real freedom is to not have to worry about these things , as they are essential and paying for them is inevitable , whether directly through taxes or indirectly through market mechanisms . 
  we are better of in this regard , because as you said , there is a weight on americans shoulders that we do n't have . 
  that line is disingenuous to say the least . 
  fortuyn was killed by leftwing extremist . 
  it is , and i 'm sure / u/notimetobeserious was being sarcastic, 
  i never realised this might happen . 
  this just keeps getting worse . 
  no , thank god . 
  fun fact , our reactor in petten produces 1/3 of all medical isotopes worldwide . 
  meaning if it goes down , there 'd probably be a worldwide shortage . 
  oh fuck off , the hallmark of someone without an argument is bitching about the language their opponent uses . 
  it 's such an empty argument . 
  you 're basically saying gay couples are incompetent when it comes to raising children and that they would impose their sexuality on them , meaning you 're degrading millions of people on bullshit assumptions but * my * language is the real problem . 
  imposing sexuality on children ? 
  what the fuck do you think parents do to their children ? 
  heterosexual parents do n't ` impose ' their sexuality on children , so why the * fuck * would gays do it ? 
  used to be you married your daughter away in return for a goat . 
  where are all the goats ? 
  weddings without goats are n't real marriages !, 
  rebel rebel !, 
  also fuck that roman-christian is our culture bullshit , not it is n't . 
  if anything my culture is protestant or calvinist , but guess what ? 
  over here it is n't , not at all . 
  you 're joking but the this is really much more efficient . 
  big boats wont be able to pass without either it being a really high bridge or a bridge that can open , which would fuck up traffic, 
  if you live in the randstad , which over 7 million of us do , public transportation works like a charm . 
  if you 're outside of it i 'm sure it could be inefficient . 
  i 'm not qualified to answer this question , but you can have my opinion if you want it . 
  i 'd say the pros are that due to is smaller size it 's a much more readily available tool for member states to use ( less bureaucracy , less interested parties etc. ) . 
  the members all have pretty aligned views and objectives in the world . 
  it provides some extra security without some of the drawbacks nato has like antagonising russia to a similar degree . 
  the uk has a formidable military so being integrated with them can provide security , and speaking for our military we 're pretty similar to the uk in using it more as surgical tool rather than a sledge hammer like the us . 
  cons ... 
  i ca n't really think of anything specific but military allignement will always antagonise someone and has responsibilities that come with it . 
  again , i 'm not an expert and am really just giving my poorly informed opinion . 
  the title is a bit misleading . 
  the joint expenditure force has existed for quite some time . 
  they 're looking into getting finland and sweden in it too . 
  from the article :  the united kingdom has offered finland and sweden the possibility of joining in the uk-lead joint expeditionary force ( jef ) , a military rapid reaction force made up of seven countries, 
  i already edited my comment regarding the size of our military . 
  other than that i agree it 's not the same , but we 're talking about the eu as a whole . 
  i already mentioned multiple times that the eu has serious military issues , the only point i 'm making is that we need to stop acting like we are defenseless against russia and like their military is top notch , able to steam role europe at a moments notice when we have 3 times the budget and over two times the troops they have . 
  the size of the us military has nothing to with that , as you guys are so far ahead in the military power game that comparing either russia or the eu to it is useless . 
  now i 'm really gon na go, 
  it 's 1/30 , but we were just talking about the afghan war here , other troops fought in other places .
