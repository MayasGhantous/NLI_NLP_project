great , good riddance . 
  i do n't want to share open borders with a arse like you . 
  i must say , you are making the perfect case to let ukraine into the eu . 
  if you can call all dutchmen ` pro-putin ' i guess i can call all ukrainians salty cunts . 
  fine , we 'll side with russia . 
  dickwad __________ edit : the comment / u/freddie _ appshero made is a perfect example of the black-white logical fallacy : `` you 're either with us or with them . '', 
  maybe we do n't like either russia or ukraine . 
  `` agressive '', 
  maybe ukraine can get some money by mining all the salt in this thread :d, 
  30 million is nothing . 
  stay salty , d'66, 
  hahaha ... oh wait , you 're serious . 
  please do n't engage in misinformation like that ... __________ edit : with misinformation i ment the second paragraph of / u/domesticatedelephant 's comment . 
  my god , people are actually upvoting you . 
  how dare you compare people with legitimate concerns with nazis , you massive bellend edit : and of course you are swiss . 
  you do realise your incredulous priviledge of not being in the eu , right ? 
   and no , trump wo n't win . 
  do n't hope for too much , you 'll be dissappointed . 
  it 's a meme ya dip, 
  `` basic logical tools '' no , you 're attacking me for daring to question the ridiculous article posted . 
  is china fascist ? 
  and which are the sufficient conditions of fascism ? 
  i take it you view those as the core tennets of fascism ? 
  fascism is indeed a form of authoritarianism . 
  and pears are a fruit . 
  does that mean that other fruits , such as apples , are pears ? 
  show me how , for example , eco 's general properties of fascism can be detected in russia . 
  you just quoted something from jeff rense 's website , a noted conspiracy theorist . 
  he has misrepresented lawrence britt 's work , besides wrongfully suggesting he has a phd and is a professor , which he is not . 
  secondly , that list is wholefully inaccurate . 
  it is too broad . 
  list of inaccuracies in the article you posted : 1 . 
  `` powerful and continuing nationalism '' . 
  such as the fascist regimes of the catalan seperatists and the scottish national party ? 
  `` identification of scapegoats '' . 
  how is this unique to fascism ? 
  this has been something of all ages and places . 
  `` the domestic agenda is neglected '' . 
  anyone who has studied any fascist literature knows this to be false . 
  fascists have an extensive domestic policy . 
  `` rampant sexism '' . 
  as has been the case with nearly all governments in the past , and a majority of governments in the present . 
  `` controlled mass media '' . 
  in which it is argued that press regulations are fascism , and that censorship is too . 
  again , these are pretty common things , believe it or not , and not exclusive to fascism . 
  `` religion and government are intertwined '' . 
  how is this fascist ? 
  `` corporate power is protected '' . 
  state power is protected . 
  fascism makes use of a thing called [ corporatism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporatism ) to organise society , i believe the mr. rense mistook the two . 
  how many of those 15 criteria must a state fulfill to in order to be considered `` fascist '' ? 
  all of them ? 
  a majority of them ? 
  you must know that mr. rense wrote this `` piece '' as a rhetorical way of showing that the usa was in fact becoming fascist . 
  in your quest to brand putin a fascist , you quoted a conspiracy theorist who believes the usa is becoming just that . 
  you also downvoted me for questioning you , i 'll downvote you for willfully quoting inaccurate articles . 
  `` fascist '' how is putin fascist ? 
  he is an authoritarian , definitely , but fascist is a step beyond that . 
  radical centrist detected . 
  obviously not . 
  fighting in wars is for stupid people !, 
  oh , young boy throwing some shade here , wewie . 
  poor turks , always mistreated in history , 
  it 's very effective . 
   for countries like the uk , sweden and germany which are estimated to have their `` native '' populations a minority by 2050 wait what ? 
   ireland is expected to have a majority population of chinese by 2050 w-what ? 
  could you share some statistics please ? 
  this sounds interesting . 
  i do n't like sarcasm regarding people getting assassinated . 
  sarcasm can also be asinine . 
  what an asinine comment . 
  edgy . 
  i do n't really understand the connection though . 
  brexit = treason , is that your point ? 
  because brexit ? 
  someone who believes right-handed people are better than left-handed people . 
  american agent detected :d, 
  oh no , the circlejerk must not be interrupted . 
  wew lad , did i trigger you or something ? 
  oh boy , do i ? 
  please , mister urban intelligentsia , enlighten me with your eternal wisdom . 
  yes :d, 
   insane proof ? 
  a failure compared to its founding ideal . 
  the eu has failed to deliver long lasting economic prosperity to many of its members states . 
  it has failed to create a fraternity of european peoples . 
  it has failed to deal with the immigration crisis . 
  it has , 65 years after , arguably , its founding document , not even succeeded in convincing enough people that a federalized europe is necessary . 
  i hope it 'll go down soon . 
  how are you right then , how is the eu is a success ? 
  enlighten me . 
  because france needed an agricultural market to sell its grain to . 
  how 's your youth employment rate , amigo ? 
  yes , it did . 
  peace is mainly to thank to nato ( not that i 'm a fan of nato ) . 
  `` the eu is a success '' - a spaniard surely a joke , right ? 
  ____ to whomever is downvoting me : i do n't care about karma , and i 'm not going to stop talking . 
  here 's a reality : the eu is a geopolitical project started by france because it needed a safe agricultural market to sell its grain to . 
  i do n't shout my opinions . 
  i can , if you want to .
