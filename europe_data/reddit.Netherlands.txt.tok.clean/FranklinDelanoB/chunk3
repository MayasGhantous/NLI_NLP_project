  for the life of me i do n't understand how these people do n't go absolutely crazy . 
  not sure if they 're scared of the unknown or simply content to be in this bubble . 
  i mean , as long as they 're happy it 's all fine of course , but i do n't understand , in this day and age , why not all young people have the urge to explore the world . 
  it 's so incredibly easy . 
  sorry for the rant . 
  my brother ( dutch ) is dating a german woman . 
  they live in brussels and speak spanish together . 
  do n't know if they 're planning on having kids but i 'm guessing they would learn three , maybe four languages . 
  i think the average globe trotter will just be more interesting than someone who has stayed in the same town all their life . 
  when i was studying in england i had a disproportionate number of non-english friends . 
  i did n't seek that out , but people who have seen many places often have interesting stories to tell . 
  also if you have to move a lot you kinda need to be a fairly sociable person as you have to make new friends often . 
  depends on a few things . 
  location : close to the german border i think a lot of people will speak pretty good german . 
  age : in general , young people will speak reasonably good english and shitty german . 
  most older people will be able to speak german . 
  ethnicity : * very * few non-western immigrants will speak any german . 
  all in all though do n't just start speaking german . 
  i think quite a few dutch people will find it insulting if you do . 
  english is fine though . 
  listening to it now , pretty sweet so far . 
  i have n't , so thanks for the tip !, 
  will check it out asap !, 
  i only listen to the radio if there 's a football game on and i ca n't find a good stream . 
  langs de lijn ( by the sidelines ) is a show on [ radio 1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/npo_radio_1 ) ( dutch version ) that commentates on all kinds of sports . 
  it started in 1967 and is still quite popular . 
  during the world cup you could stream the games online and add commentary from the radio . 
  it was great . 
  i love their commentary on football and cycling . 
  it 's ridiculously exciting . 
  during football games it seems like there is no midfield and that the ball is constantly near one of the goals . 
  it 's not good for your heart . 
  they also have a sweet intro tune : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kyyhmgixwy and for the tour de france even better in my opinion because of the nostalgia : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5c4pf--55s, 
  love that guy . 
  saw him live at roskilde festival a few years ago . 
  great essential mix , i listen to it often . 
  i 've got my personal favorite to add as well : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe8hjttwpys, 
  i love those . 
  they can stop a fucking bullet . 
  i live in south africa and a bunch of my zimbabwean friends have them . 
  i did n't realize know they never expire . 
  despite the fact you need to be 18 to buy a knife . 
  i remember starting uni there and having to show my id when i bought a bread knife . 
  i was very insulted so i stabbed the cashier . 
  do n't they always ? 
  kinda weird if you had a 30 year old picture on your id . 
  a really disgusting creature . 
  kind of like a fungus , but technically a mammal . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geert_wilders ) . 
  what kind of people live in flevoland ? 
  i 've never been there and do n't know anyone who is from there . 
  flevoland is definitely up there . 
  limburg and the south in general are made fun of as well . 
  i think because of the accent and the fact wilders is so popular there . 
  ( the question was about specific cities but the south has too many backwards cities/towns to list ), 
  yeah that 's what you say in dutch . 
  decennium is singular , decennia plural . 
  gek \u2260 stupid . 
  it means crazy . 
  that 's way different . 
  also this saying refers to `` normaal doen '' as in , being a normal , decent person . 
  it does n't mean you should dress or act like everyone else , just do n't be an asshole . 
  i actually find it a really nice saying . 
  dutch football players often say `` mijn ding doen '' = `` do my thing '' . 
  i 'm not sure but i feel like it 's taken directly from english and i personally think it sounds idiotic . 
  fairly certain it 's a recent thing . 
  also `` een biertje doen '' = '' * do * a beer '' . 
  it makes no sense . 
  i think mostly college students say this . 
  maybe only a certain group , but i heard it a * lot * last time i was in holland . 
  i did n't realize it was a training / exhibition at first . 
  very confused why the `` criminals '' were sort of but not really trying to resist arrest . 
  also the laughter really threw me off . 
  thanks !, 
  moved a year and a half ago though so i 'm pretty settled , 
  surely if it 's not interesting it wo n't get upvoted ? 
  i do n't get what the big deal is . 
  i personally quite like the content of / r/europe . 
  it 's much better than your average subreddit . 
  what is this ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  i moved to cape town , south africa : http://i.imgur.com/0goccor.jpg, 
  i much prefer germany over belgium . 
  i think mostly southerners like belgium . 
  prices will also probably drop in the west . 
  it 's shitty for the producers but for european and american consumers it 's not so bad ( in the short term , that is ) . 
  yeah sorry i just meant that i think he * was * crowned the `` normal '' way rather than appointed . 
  those photos are all of the coronation . 
  i do n't live in holland anymore but i 'm pretty sure it was a pretty big deal : http://www.nrc.nl/inbeeld/2013/04/30/de-inhuldiging-van-koning-willem-alexander/, 
  boom !, 
  grammared . 
  with a trailer , which is `` typically '' dutch, 
  the dutch countryside is really terrible , especially the south . 
  i would seriously be happy if noord brabant and limburg would someone just disappear . 
  as a dutch person who has n't lived in holland for over a decade , i really love it . 
  not at all in a nationalistic way , but whenever i 'm back , especially in amsterdam , i ca n't help but feel it has such a unique and sweet vibe . 
  i do n't know any other city that has so much to offer in terms of culture , nightlife , etc and that 's so friendly and laid back at the same time . 
  i can definitely understand the appeal to foreigners . 
  denmark - have lots of friends from there and have been there lots of times . 
  very similar people and country to holland germany - same story really .
