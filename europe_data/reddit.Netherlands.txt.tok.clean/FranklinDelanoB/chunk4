  also berlin is one of the most fun cities i 've been to ( in europe ) hungary - visited only once and just budapest so maybe a one-sided view but also a great place . 
  lots of history and great architecture ... big fan . 
   admittedly only the london area  it 's so energetic and there 's small pubs everywhere i think london is great . 
  i would never want to live there but to visit it 's an awesome place . 
  that being said , i 'm not too fond of the uk as a whole . 
  i did my undergrad in york and it 's a rather boring , slow town . 
  some other places i 've been to like birmingham , bristol , oxford , st. andrews were quite different but meh , [ geef mij maar amsterdam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iudo_gbt_c ) . 
  i much prefer it over london as well . 
  much more livable place if you ask me . 
  that 's kind of the thing with the uk i think : visiting it is awesome , but living there is completely different . 
  ok so you 're saying things backfire when : 1 . 
  the west does n't get involved in ukraine 2 . 
  the west * does * get involved in afghanistan and iraq what exactly do you want governments to do ? 
  realpolitik is about realism as much as self-interest . 
  your points are nice but so incredibly unrealistic . 
  moral high ground means shit when you have to deal with the likes of putin , hamas , al qaeda , etc. 
  western countries * are n't * going to solve conflicts that have gone on for generations regardless of any sort of `` superior '' sense of morality . 
   that 's the equivalent to building walls and not giving a damn on what happens on the other side . 
  i seriously think we should have moved past that point by now , in terms of civilization . 
  and being complacent or maybe a cynic , while a good coping strategy , does n't help anyone in the long run . 
  this is such a dramatic way of phrasing this . 
  the fact is that we live in the most prosperous as well as safe time period of modern civilization . 
  things really are n't so bad at all from an historical point of view . 
  your claim that we `` should have moved past '' not caring about other peoples is just silly . 
  70 years ago we were in the middle of world war ii and the cold war did n't end until 25 years ago , but now you want everyone to live in peace and harmony and care about the well being of all humans ? 
  it 's a lovely but incredibly naive thought . 
  the waiter analogy really does n't work because it 's not at all comparable . 
  politics and going out to dinner are n't quite the same . 
  no one expected this plane to be shot down . 
  it 's not limited foresight , it 's tradeoffs between economic consequences , political support , and perhaps some ethical considerations . 
  it 's politics as usual . 
   zero solidarity towards ailing countries i do n't really think ukraine was that much of an ally . 
  not eu , not nato . 
  there * is * a lot of solidarity among true allies within the eu though . 
  regardless , it 's unreasonable to think the richest countries on this planet would always get involved to prevent `` killing and oppression '' . 
  there are so many places where this happens , why would the eu get involved in ukraine but not in the middle east , sudan , north korea , mali , kenya , somalia , etc , etc ? 
  it 's a ridiculous thing to point out this so-called selfishness . 
  obviously every country cares mostly for their own people and economy . 
  it 's realpolitik . 
  this is n't new , it is n't surprising . 
  the point that countries are being selfish is so incredibly stupid . 
  as if it 's ever been any different !, 
  what changed is that 194 dutch people died so the country cares a lot more now . 
  that 's such a typical thing , i have no idea why we 're even discussing this . 
  it 's really naive to think that kind of thing does n't happen all the fucking time . 
  people do n't really care that much about the atrocities that are happening in north korea , but if suddenly 100 westerners got kidnapped and sent to a prison camp there the west would do something . 
  sure putin is the same person but now it 's affected the west , and especially the netherlands , in a very direct way . 
  before it harmed ukrainians which is terrible , but not quite worth the economic consequences of the drastic sanctions against russia that are currently on the table . 
  super , super , super standard politics . 
   he 's saying your population is too dumb to realize that russian aggression impacts them as well until they get hit in the head with it , or the turbine in this case . 
  that 's just kinda ridiculous . 
  people knew but unsurprisingly did n't care that much because it did n't affect them directly . 
  now it has so they care more . 
  i just do n't understand what point she/he 's making though . 
  sorry but i still do n't understand what you 're trying to say, 
  well obviously things change after such an event . 
  i do n't really get what point you 're trying to make . 
  spanish is my third language and it 's the opposite for me . 
  i feel self conscious because i am ( or used to be probably ) quite close to speaking it really well . 
  definitely not on the same level as dutch or english , but good enough to feel very comfortable in a room with only ( latin american ) spanish speakers . 
  i think subconsciously i thought that making stupid mistakes would make it obvious i was the odd one out . 
  approaching it like you do it so much better . 
  i never have any problems with non-native speakers making mistakes in english and especially not in dutch so why should i put so much pressure on myself ? 
  yeah i agree . 
  the people in the article seemed to speak a certain language only with their family back home ; i think audience is much more relevant than it simply being another language . 
  i speak dutch and english informally with friends and formally with family / at university . 
  i do n't think i 'm very different in those two but would love to take a test . 
  i feel i * am * a bit different when speaking spanish , though that perhaps has to do with the fact i 've learned it at an older age and i feel self conscious about making mistakes so i 'm more careful with my words . 
  my brother has told me my voice sounds differently in spanish as well , i have no idea why that is but perhaps it 's related . 
  honestly all this bullshit with russia can be a weird blessing in disguise * . 
  drastically reducing gas and oil imports from russia will require the eu to find alternative sources of energy . 
  if instead of spending billions on russian oil and gas the eu spends that money on renewables i will be extremely happy . 
  * though the loss of life really is n't worth it, 
  i was really impressed by his speech as well . 
  i think you were right he was overcome by his emotions , especially when he was talking about political games ( referring to what the russian representative said earlier , claiming the west was playing political games ) . 
  he also speaks fluent russian ( among a few other languages ) which has probably been useful . 
  he is n't the ambassador to the un though . 
  his name is [ frans timmermans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frans_timmermans ) and he 's the minister of foreign affairs . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://www.netherlandsmission.org/organization/ambassadors-office ) is the ambassador but no one knows him . 
  at least we can almost all gloat in english and most of us in german . 
  yeah sorry i changed it, 
  it 's wrong though . 
  [ the netherlands is actually 90 % ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bo0nwzz.png ) . 
  71 % of dutch people speak german . 
  but dude check the [ source ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bo0nwzz.png ) . 
  ~ ~ you ~ ~ the person who made this made a mistake ; it 's actually 90 % . 
  the 71 % is about german . 
  nice !, 
  i was a bit disappointed with 71 % . 
  i 'm quite impressed with 90 % and very impressed 71 % can speak german !, 
  check out / u/suikerklontje 's [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27oxbk/percentage_of_people_in_the_eu_being_able_to_hold/ci36t97 ) . 
  it 's actually 90 % . 
  71 % of people speak german . 
   the case highlights growing concerns about so-called online reputation management , which has spawned an industry that helps eliminate or minimize damaging information online . 
  does n't that mostly apply to companies and politicians though ? 
  the first ca n't use this law ( i 'm assuming ) because they 're not individuals . 
  the second group ca n't just erase google results because something critical is written about them , as long as the law is carried out properly . 
  exactly , * were * . 
  you keep talking in the past tense . 
  i 'm talking about the groenlinks of 2014 .
