  that ' s ccclxxvi for those who do n't speak english . 
  why are american stop signs in slovenian ? 
  why are romanian stop signs in dutch ? 
  why are italian stop signs in polish ? 
  could it be the word stop is the same in all these languages ? 
  - u instead of you is not a fair example ; u on its own means nothing - hague instead of the hague makes no sense and i 've never seen anyone use it - holland , on the other hand , is a very common way of saying the netherlands in english . 
  no one thinks it 's just noord and zuid holland . 
  people do n't say holland because it 's ` easier ' , it 's just happens to be the way most people say it . 
  a counter example : do you always say `` the united states of america '' ? 
  or do you sometimes say just the united states , or maybe just america ? 
  do you ever talk about the uk ? 
  well then you 're a hypocrite because you 're leaving out northern ireland . 
  seriously why bother with something so trivial ? 
  i 'm mostly joking actually . 
  the disproportionate amount of pvv voters in limburg is undeniable though . 
  that 's pretty fucked up do n't you think ? 
  you 're the second person to do this . 
  stop being so difficult about the whole holland/netherlands thing . 
  in english it 's just much more common to say holland . 
  obviously i do n't mean only noord and zuid holland . 
   it 's also because it 's a less advantaged region the north of holland has traditionally been the least advantaged area of the country and the pvda ( partij van de arbeid ) and sp ( socialistische/socialistiese partij ) are by far the most popular . 
  the pvv , on the other hand , is very unpopular . 
   the only reason for liberal parties to act either progressively or conservatively is if it suits them . 
  that 's not true . 
  d66 has always been a progressive party because they have an ideology they stick by . 
  i just think most * big * parties act according to whatever is most popular because they want to stay in power . 
  the smaller parties are generally quite ideological . 
  [ they are bad guys . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/pvv.png ) that 's the percentage of [ pvv ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/partij_voor_de_vrijheid ) voters . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/den_uyl_cabinet ), 
  the vvd is a supposedly `` liberal '' party but the only thing they 're liberal about is the economy . 
  in terms of personal freedoms they 're really shitty . 
  sadly it 's the biggest party at the moment . 
  limburg is a province in the south east of holland which , quite frankly , i would happily give away to belgium . 
  if she 's a true liberal why does n't she join d66 ? 
  surely she 'd agree more with their ideas . 
  she 's still a vvd ` er from limburg . 
  [ technically part of the european union ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee_iupineuc ) and a nice change of pace from all the dark , gray , and rainy skylines : [ willemstad !, 
  i was at a student party in belgrade a few summers ago . 
  some serbian guys asked my friend is he was gay . 
  he is n't so he told them no . 
  they replied : `` good !, 
  now we do n't have to beat you up '' . 
  and if it 's cold enough , [ ice skating on the canals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kztgwoarsw ) . 
  yeah that 's very true . 
  could be something really random like luxembourg was mentioned in some nationwide commercial or something . 
  probably not that but it just seems like an odd thing to know . 
  yeah i was thinking about that as well . 
  kinda looks like it 's joking about how ignorant they are . 
  seems like a very american thing to do , though maybe it 's something completely different ( like if they knew it was going to be posted online and just wanted to be funny ) . 
  if it 's any consolation i 've been to serbia !, 
  novi sad and belgrade . 
  enjoyed it a lot . 
  yeah honestly i 'm surprised . 
  i think all these people who did the maps had heard of the netherlands / holland and most definitely amsterdam . 
  for some reason putting it on a map is really difficult . 
   a capital city with a pot-selling district you can buy weed in every dutch city ( or village , wherever there 's a coffeeshop ) , there are no special areas like christiania . 
  i lived in nicaragua for four years , so yes . 
  before i moved though i did n't really know where it was to be honest . 
  then again i was 13 ... 
  i agree that holland is n't * that * emancipated . 
  it shows in the maternity leave , as well . 
  fathers get relatively little , exacerbating the problem of fathers not doing chores around the house . 
  relatively few women hold high positions in the corporate world and we have n't had a female prime minster yet . 
  all quite strange since i think on a personal level the vast , vast majority of women would feel very emancipated . 
  for some reason it 's not reflected in government policy and things like helping out around the house . 
  i find it a bit unfair they made it blue and red , as if owning a house is always better than renting . 
  sometimes renting makes a lot more financial sense and , this is speculation , may increase mobility . 
  if you own a house and ca n't sell , you ca n't really move cities for a new job , for example . 
  not sure how true this is but there are definitely benefits to renting . 
  i checked out [ the statistics for the netherlands ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/arbeid-sociale-zekerheid/cijfers/extra/werkende-moeders.htm ) and this list is just plain wrong . 
  according to the dutch statistics service around 77 % of mothers work , depending on the age of their kid ( s ) . 
  the [ source ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/income_social_inclusion_living_conditions/documents/tab/tab/2011%20module%20assessment%20of%20implementation%20for%20the%20website.pdf ) of this list has no definition for `` work '' , so how are we supposed to know which category a part-time working mother who does the bulk of domestic work falls under ? 
  if i had turned in a report like this in for my social research class i would get a shitty grade if i left out the definition one of the most important elements of my research . 
  another incorrect part of this survey :  the average number of children in the household ranged from 1.7 in france to 3.2 in the netherlands the average number of children per woman in the netherlands is between 1.7 and 1.8 ( [ source ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/bevolking/faq/specifiek/faq-hoeveel-kinderen.htm ) ) . 
  adoption may increase that number slightly , but i do n't see how they could possibly get to 3.2 children per household . 
  for holland the data is simply incorrect , or the definitions of these categories are weird . 
  i 'm pretty sure holland has a high rate of women working part-time . 
  they are both employees and fulfilling the bulk of domestic tasks . 
  maybe these statistics only account for women working full time . 
  i checked it out : [ here ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/arbeid-sociale-zekerheid/cijfers/extra/werkende-moeders.htm ) are the stats for holland . 
  it says around 77 % of mothers work ( depending on how old the kid ( s ) is/are ) , the vast majority of whom work over 20 hours per week . 
  if you happen to be good at kicking around a ball it 's a lot easier to get european citizenship as well . 
  i do n't like it either , but i do n't think this is too big of a deal . 
  who the fuck is going to do this except some rich folk ? 
  if they have something evil in mind surely it would be easier to track them if they 're citizens since you 'd have all their info , so i do n't really see what the issue is beyond the fact it is , of course , absolutely ridiculous . 
  yeah i meant the face of the king . 
  bit confusing perhaps , i changed my comment . 
  i think it would have been cool to have the face of king in the style of various dutch painters . 
  you could have the $ 2 coin in the style of van gogh , $ 1 rembrandt , $ 0.50 m.c. 
  escher , etc. 
  in holland there 's [ de speld ] ( http://www.speld.nl/ ) . 
  a recent article i quite enjoyed : `` dutch government wants to know why prime minster mark rutte 's phone has n't been tapped by nsa '' and : `` cabinet creates extra job in 2014 '' last one : `` nobel peace prize goes to nobel peace prize '', 
  i have had a soft spot for the finnish national team because of [ jari litmanen ] ( http://youtu.be/rfldz2kdcm0 ) . 
  such a shame he never got a chance to play a euro/world cup . 
  at first i thought this post was from / r/soccer which i 'm also subrscriped to and was even more impressed . 
  i had to look up the name but remember the story . 
  it 's absurd how these people get away with that . 
  there was an old colleague of my dad who worked at a dutch embassy somewhere who got in trouble with local police , i believe , over child molestation . 
  i 'm not at all sure about the details ( he lived in a different country from us ) but i know he got fired , sent back to holland ... and after that i do n't know what happened .
