  oh i did n't know that i though it applied for all . 
  well egypt is a state . 
  so maybe he is in state of denial . 
  good to know . 
  haha do n't worry we know what it means . 
  yeah that explains it . 
  i hope it will be kind of `` warm '' winter for eastern europe . 
  you never know when russia cuts off the gas . 
  wow i just saw next week it will be 19 degree 's over here . 
  does it snow now there atm ? 
  because here everyting is still green and warm . 
  nice to see there is a `` lowlands '' on the other side of the world . 
  you should be prepare your inbox , linking to pb is a violation of pb rules . 
  a face only his mother could love . 
  seriousley ? 
  they expect that if you are a eu citizen you have the right to demand a house ? 
  well i can go with that . 
  lit the torches and ready the pitchforks !, 
  `` gateway to europe '' and we have amsterdam which is nice . 
  i disagree , denmark is much more [ north ] ( https://www.google.nl/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;docid=qjytk5vxfukjgm&amp;tbnid=rxaqn9q8f-svwm:&amp;ved=0cacqjrw&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.standard.co.uk%2flifestyle%2fbooks%2ftoo-much-light-in-our-darkness--a-plea-for-the-pleasure-of-seeing-stars-8675992.html&amp;ei=-ss3vlrvcovypjhxgdgj&amp;bvm=bv.77161500,d.zwu&amp;psig=afqjcnedpr2cu5dsmwkvg2gxc8m6dymbcg&amp;ust=1413029217954923 ), 
  he do n't forget us , we are in the picture as well . 
  camp nou does n't look big from the outside , but when you enter you realize it is dug half into the ground , its huge . 
  oww , the japanese , always doing things a little bit different than the rest of the world . 
  americans , the netherlands is a lot more than just amsterdam . 
  try going to other parts of the country you would be suprised how different amsterdam is compared to the rest . 
  and you are all family to eachother !, 
  i think i read something about an app you can download in iceland that could verify that if you meet someone it could tell of you were family . 
  yes , i absolutely agree with this . 
  the dutch [ throne ] ( http://i.imgur.com/llkotwr.jpg ) . 
  sober and simple just the way we like it . 
  good , good let the products flow through you germany . 
  might be one of the biggest things in reddit 's history . 
  nice , that we are trending . 
  you would n't expect that with / r/thefappening going crazy . 
  this is awsome . 
  i knew europe has some very nice nature , but not this blows my mind . 
  and the wadden sea is pretty big . 
  this is it . 
  i guess you can clearly see where i am from without my [ flair ] ( http://imgur.com/pqa9vz8 ) . 
  no , the you can pick them up at the depots , or at least if you can find your bike between the thousands of other bikes . 
  hahaha, 
  maybe you should try posting this on / r/thenetherlands . 
  they have probably the anwser you are looking for . 
  you too ? 
  pffew i am glad i am not the only one . 
  heheheh , gues ger * men * y has struck the * short * * end * of the * stick * . 
  i ^ am ^ so ^ sorry . 
  yes , she married a dutch man which turns her into a dutch citizen . 
  i am against the idea . 
  i am sure that there will be reason she wanted to live here and not russia near her father . 
  even though the whole country is in mourning , she has nothing to do with the downing of mh17 . 
  she is a dutch citizen and has equal rights as any other dutch citizen . 
  in the netherlands we have the same sentiment . 
  the general feeling is that we have no control on the eu and have no idea what it and its laws is and how they influence us . 
  well , now i am gettting hungry . 
  yeah , it does not have image for being illegal ( it is ) and therefore does not appeal that much . 
  looks like the germans can look in to the future . 
  this could be an opportunity for the european forces to prove the critics wrong that we ca n't defense ourselves and our interest . 
  that everyone in the netherlands is stoned . 
  that is just amsterdam folks . 
  nice , high at all times when it is necessary . 
  a true dutchman to my hart . 
  look at the bright side , we were second . 
  we were never that high in a decade !, 
  6 ) is rather [ keukenhof ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keukenhof ) than london . 
  80 ) is [ bruges ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brugge ) edit : it is brussels , my apologies . 
  very nice timelaps and beautifully made . 
  i recognize some but it would be great if a list could be made that would name them all . 
  could be a great list for people who are looking for places to visit . 
  to all , everyone should be treated equally . 
  hahaha just beautiful !, 
  it summarises it perfectly !, 
  thank you . 
  that is not really the case . 
  it 's about people refusing to adapt to the country where they live . 
  everyone has to live together and it will be a lot easier if everyone could understand eachother is n't it . 
  i do n't agree with you there . 
  welfare imo is a tool to help people stand on there own feet in the first few years . 
  the risk with constantly providing welfare is that people deliberately refuse to learn or to develop themselves . 
  this * will * become a problem and * will * not be accepted by fellow citizens . 
  but if they have lived here for a considerable amount of time and still refuse to learn dutch , cutting them on welfare is the first step in forcing them to develop themselves . 
  if that does not work and they turn to crime the last resort is sending them back to their country of origin . 
  although it is difficult to draw a line they probably will . 
  it would be unreasonable in some cases and i am convinced they will make exceptions . 
  i agree . 
  if you migrate to another country at least * try * to adapt and fit in with society . 
  you do n't have to give up everything but at least everyone should have the possibility to communicate with eachother . 
  this will make it easier to understand and accept eachothers culture and convictions . 
  just take a look at his account ... i am suspicious , really suspicious . 
  well , if turkey reached the point that they actually * wants * to join the eu , there is lot of work to be done on various subjects like the freedom of the press , corruption and human rights . 
  and then is the issue that a considerable amount of people have to be convinced that a europe with turkey could be a stronger europe . 
  equally true , we should give the region a name other than being a part of the southern ocean , any suggestions ? 
  is n't that much more south ? 
  hmm , who would have thought that someone expected that ukraine is situated below new zealand . 
  where there is only water . 
  and no land . 
  i drink with you comrade . 
  i did not say we use it not at all , it 's just not as much as others . 
  that 's logical that we do n't use much russian gas .
