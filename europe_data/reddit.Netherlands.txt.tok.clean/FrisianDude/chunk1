that 's a matter of principle . 
  i do n't want them , but you ca n't have them . 
  belgium has all those silly hill things , not proper flat . 
  fuck no, 
  no such thing as too much terry pratchett . 
  him diamond . 
  i will not abide such insults to my person !, 
  i asked because it looked similar , the name , to ` comp\u00f4te ' which has been lifted from french to dutch and refers to thingies ... like apple sauce , only if it 's comp\u00f4te it 's got bits in . 
  what is kompot ? 
  hahaha . 
  being jerks to children . 
  comedy gold . 
  yes, 
  i get what you mean now . 
  yeah but a surplus of what ? 
  energy ? 
  will ? 
  curiosity ? 
  yeah that is translatable to surplus . 
  also overschot in dutch :d . not sure it would work like that in the sentence though . 
  ~ ~ what it will look like or how it will look :p ~ ~ but srsly that looks grand, 
  yyyeah surplus was n't really the right word i think . 
  :p something like ` enough ' would probably be preferable , only then it does n't say enough of what . 
  eh i do n't really know if it is . 
  :p i just would n't be surprised . 
  / r/askhistorians has experts and people who actually researched things :d, 
  eh , in explainlikeimfive you run the risk of hardly-even-interested planks trying to explain things they only vaguely know because they heard it vaguely . 
  nowhere neaaar on the same level as what op describes . 
  besides , the southrons are just wrong . 
  no need for dispute . 
   were descended from the vikings . 
  they were , to some extent , but that was some two centuries before the normans conquered england . 
  i 'm not sure who was living in normandy prior to rollo whose group added the north-ness to normandy , but my understanding is essentially that the normans were a continuation of both those groups rather than one or the other . 
  a continuation who developed to be quite distinct from their most famous ancestors . 
  essentially they developed , imo , not as frenchified vikings but as slightly vikingized frenchmen . 
  i do n't really know how to argue that beyond some names ` de brus ' and ` fitzurse ' are both ( rather famous ) norman surnames but do n't seem viking at all . 
  i completely forgot though to mention another factor in why the groups are separate in op 's map ; the ` viking ' bit refers to vikings who around the eighth and ninth centuries ` colonized ' a whole lot of it ( including , afaik , dublin ) whereas the ` norman ' bit on the map refers to 11th , 12th and 13th century anglo-norman ( essentially norman ` upperclass ' of knights and barons ) conquest and colonization attempts . 
  mind you , i do n't get why ` galloglass ' is a specific national identity on this map . 
  my understanding was that galloglass simply refered to a class of ( mercenary ) soldiers . 
  perhaps those were the predominant recruiting grounds . 
  tbh , perhaps / r/askhistorians would do a far better job of explaining , it 's a very smart subreddit . 
  nope . 
  * norman * in english is derived from ` northman ' as far as i know , but refers to an inhabitant of normandy . 
  sometimes people insist the normans who boarded billy the bastard 's boats and barges to bring battle to the british ( i know , english ) were vikings , but rollo had settled there more than two hundred years before william ... norman by the eleventh century being quite separate from ` north man ' as normans ( as the gens normannorum ) probably considered themselves far more similar to the english than to the ` barbarian ' vikings and such . 
  and this is a further 4 centuries ahead . 
  does n't danish use different words for those ? 
   dutch does ; noorman ( sort of easier to pronounce noordman ; northman ) and normandi\u00ebr ; someone from normandi\u00eb . 
   minotity minotitty !, 
  no , not really . 
  i am quite pleased i managed to pre-empt anyone daft enough to think frysl\u00e2n wants to . 
  no , not really . 
   a lot of kids can be assholes , anyone who 's been around them can testify to that . 
  some kid laughed at me when i fell with my bike this morning . 
  asshole . 
   gay nazis like r\u00f6hm ? 
   joke aside , i recently discovered that we had quite a good relationship with you guys also during the rampjaar of 1672 !, 
  fun fact ; the name ` dagobert ' is used for scrooge mcduck in dutch translations and originally referred to franks . 
  that honestly looks nice . 
  and baghdad is babylon, 
  i do realize that hope is more powerful , but it seems to represent what the artists * want * to believe of obama rather than what they actually seem to think . 
  but hey , i 've not been to either country so i do n't know for sure . 
  that seems different bullshit . 
  i mean , these images represent obama as hope ; as debatable as that is , it 's a far cry from putin as foiler-of-international-plots and smasher-of-the-enemy and protector-of-ukraine-against-imperialist-fascism . 
  tbh it seems more a matter of hope of ` can we finally be done with this shit ' . 
  because of noatak_kenway 's flair i misread yours and was baffled about  i think we are the only eu member who had a war on its territory recently . 
   110 million people that 's just silly . 
  it 's too much !, 
  let 's hope they keep it !, 
  monarchy ' just does n't have the same ring to it . 
  uh that 's what he 's saying . 
  they 're opposed to a policy of ` open borders ' because that * literally suggests that their job would no longer be necessary . 
  * he did not say anywhere in that post that more immigrants create jobs . 
  edit of course the old `` i deliberately misunderstand things and then downvote when someone actually is reasonable '', 
  eh , i would n't really call them all that ` liberaal ' either . 
  best not engage , really . 
  you mean that it 's about muslims , or is the elephant in this case the german named ` godblessadolfhitler ' ? 
  also frisian like brometheus / u/theactualawdev 's post ;[ a frisian version of leonard cohen 's ` halleluja ' \\ ( and frankly , none the worse for it \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydbmjc5dzrm ) sung by nynke laverman who also does portuguese-fado based singing like here ; [ vida triste ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkgcqx7ecvq ) also a thoroughly amusing [ normaal-vulgaris magistralis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6lrmxbpbqk ) in [ achterhooks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normaal ) . 
  probably all true , but there seems a snippiness to what little israeli diplomacy i read ( mostly on europe ) that seems out of place , even if warranted . 
  like the israeli embassy in ireland ; they 've done some silliness whic has been on here , and then a foreign minister who essentially goes `` well , nyah '' , ehhh . 
  he probably does have a point , i agree . 
  but this does n't seem the way to make it . 
  diplomacy does n't come from sniping snippets surely, 
  :p * yeah sure , but i have to admit that i grew up speaking bildtish rather than frisian *, 
  kind of . 
  `` how to fob off criticism with shitty one-liners '', 
  yeah but that 's a commiserable word as well . 
  it 's not just long , it 's just silly . 
  and i 'm not german p, 
  so add an english translation like / u/dclauzel does, 
  i actually kind of like it , just add some french to it all . 
  as an extra , that drawing looks unneccessarily ( how many letters are in this word ) saucy too . 
  ooh that was on qi, 
  yeah . 
  pide is usually called ` turks brood ' in dutch, 
  i thought pide was more a bread thing . 
  because of the silly joke where i replaced all vowels with accented and scandinavian ones . 
  the bald-hair-bald-hair thing is somewhat amusing . 
  also some very good classical composers from there like prokofiev and such, 
  now i wonder where you 're from , 
   not every land is the land of po [ 1 ] indeed , a strict maximum of two-per-europe,
