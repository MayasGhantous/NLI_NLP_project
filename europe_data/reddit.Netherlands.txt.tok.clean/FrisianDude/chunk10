  also my closest soulmates are in latvia , lithuania i 'm farthest from luxembourg , the netherlands but ... but . 
  butts . 
  leeuwarden and valletta are going to share cultural capital soon . 
  so clearly you are the embodiment of european culture in that year . 
  makes sense . 
  you 're the only country who fought for a hundred years to become france . 
  with accents and shit . 
  ex-redditor / u/drabkikker had a blogpost about it linked in / r/frisia a while ago arguing that the use of exonyms is endemic and that it makes sense due to linguistical differences . 
  i 'm gon na see if the link is still around . 
  found it , but it 's written in dutch . 
  want link , y/n ? 
  yeah it makes some sense , but to be honest ; ` beijing ' does n't seem much more right than ` peking ' does . 
  i wonder how someone natively from the city thinks about those versions of names for it . 
  kinda happens all the time though , in my experience . 
  though that 's mostly dutch ; londen , berlijn , parijs . 
  though that said , english `` brussels '' seems a strange combination of ` brussel ' and ` bruxelles ' . 
  i think i heard a mouse in my room this morning , but beyond that , nope . 
  exactly, 
  as an aside there ; i do n't think the vow itself is more important than an agreement between spouses . 
  if both agree not to fuck other people than each other ; then i 'd say it 's `` cheating '' and nauuuughty to do so . 
  if both go `` i do n't mind spouse fucking someone else '' then those theoretical vows can take a running jump . 
  as an aside-aside , i just noticed your name says ` durandal ' and i just read a book-chapter where someone was mocking a virgin knight for naming his own sword durandal after the mythical example . 
  gips is gypsum in dutch . 
  as well as the plaster used for casts ` round broken bones . 
  though to be honest i 'm sure it 's easy to take a simple catchphrase as intended as insult , but i for one respect pigs . 
  they 're cool beasties . 
  not sure if ` forward ' should be ` clear ' ; even not-progressives seem to have that attitude . 
  which is why it kinda peeves me when i see it on okcupid profiles . 
  `` oh hey i 'm totally this string of letters as if a ) you know what it means , b ) it actually means anything , c ) is more clear than simply describing myself . '', 
  low-saxon seems more a group than a particular dialect to me . 
  drents , twents , stallingwarfs and a bunch of other dialects are part of that group . 
  i presume stallingwarfs has had quite some influence from frisian compared to the others , though . 
  well , almost . 
  i speak bildtish at home , a sort of mixture of dutch and frisian . 
  it 's limited to the municipality ( and people from areas just around it ) , mostly . 
  i 'm fairly sure i can converse with some other dutch dialects in it , though . 
   it really kills your motivation to get out of the house . 
  absolutely . 
  was n't that `` emirati '' ? 
  and a mother called marie , and a sister called marie, 
  rome 's more to the south . 
  and i 'd agree with the trepidation , but it 's still plain killing someone for being somewhere you do n't want them to be . 
  fairly sure there 's other ways to get someone to vamoose . 
  not a school shooting according to the article . 
  he was shot in someone 's garage by someone who apparently prefers wasting people over wasting words . 
  well that starts off hilariously overdramatic . 
  i do n't know those other types either . 
  most beer is either called ` pils ' or ` bier ' here , even if there 's variations in what type it might be , as far as i know . 
  :p that said , [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tripel_karmeliet ) is good stuff . 
  i tried to look it up , according to [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/fruit-and-vegetables/product-reports/apples-and-pears/slide-shows/grex-presentation-mele-2011_en.pdf ) in 2011 most apples imported from outside the eu were from chile ( page 4 ) of about 150k t. apples imported from the us were ( page 5 ) easily dwarfed by the chile-imports at less than 10k t. and then page 6 ; eu total export of apples near 600 k t . the first link is from [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/fruit-and-vegetables/product-reports/apples-and-pears/index_en.htm ) , the top ` slideshow ' mentioned at the bottom of the page . 
  big brands tend to have fairly big assortments though . 
  i 'm not sure if they 're dark ipa 's ( they 're usually named rather than labelled ) , but some might be . 
  i mean i do n't know what dark ipa is but by the looks of it maybe something like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/guldendraakvintage.jpg/266px-guldendraakvintage.jpg ) ( belgian ) or [ this ] ( http://www.hertogjan.nl/admin_assets/content/content_visuals/76-content_05.png ) could qualify ? 
  i 've actually found another brewer 's site which also makes ` dark india pale ales ' but they say they ca n't really qualify it . 
  if only there was n't a certain country in between . 
  edit ; you guys have your e 's and a 's the wrong way ` round . 
  as dutchman , i 'm not offended . 
  your treat then . 
  more lamb, 
  no mister merkel , i expect you to dry !, 
  `` yuo smelly horse '' is way too funny for me . 
  in germanic languages as a whole i 'd even suggest . 
  dutch has almost the same thing for a flying machine ( a term which imo makes more sense than ` airplane ' ) ; vliegtuig . 
  i ca n't compare with zeeland , but i can vouch for not being able to understand a damn thing of maastrichtian dialect when i moved there . 
  even when i spoke heavily accented dutch and they spoke their heavily accented dutch it was difficult . 
  eh , in a few years that nordic union is just an extra layer between eu ( stronk ! ), 
  and the scandicountries . 
  `` if you 're a diplomat who studied danish especially for negotiation purposes and wonder why this machine answers in english press 3 '', 
  yes , smash your brother/rival 's children headfirst into boulders !, 
  oh , only sweden is more trusted . 
  only because they ca n't speak it themselves . 
  or write it , for that matter . 
  punched with a wrecking ball . 
  yeah , it 's pretty fucking funny that jihad groups would suicide bomb each other . 
  `` hey , my wife is n't a dago '', 
  dutch . 
  within the netherlands , frisian . 
  i bet andromedans are lactose intolerant and will try to force us to give up our milk, 
  web of trust says that site has very poor trustworthiness , just a headsup . 
  welfare and union are the cause of european troubles ? 
  golden dawn is a great name for narcissies imo . 
  too bad about the party nicking the name . 
  only i did n't expect flowers when i read the title , i expected the poem . 
  i really hate the term ` hive mind ' . 
  your opponents are not a swarm of insects , even if you 've convinced yourself they 're working with one mind and are out to get you . 
  red has always been the colour of commie-company it 's repugnicants who are too dumb  : u, 
  true i guess . 
  but if someone wants to contribute to a thread they 'd have to do it in the language most widely read , i guess . 
  i mean , i could comment in dutch and plenty people 'd be able t oread it , but most would n't . 
  which makes sense , given that most conversation here happens in english . 
  if someone 'd posted something in french without context or clues it 'd probably be downvoted as well . 
  something with ham . 
  sunshine . 
  wish i had an island but it 's a compliment . 
  ardennnen are awesome . 
  silesian coat of arms ( and name ) is of the bitchin ' variety , though . 
  like its moravian counterparts . 
  great idea , this thread . 
  ... awesome . 
  oh jesus i 've had tiramisu exactly once and i was apprehensive about it .
