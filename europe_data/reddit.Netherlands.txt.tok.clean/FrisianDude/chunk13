  and `` this is literally asking for it '', 
  jesus , looks like a throat wound ? 
  done dealie . 
  ''  :( '' makes it fairly clear it 's a joke . 
  oh yeah protesters just went `` hey government troops , you know those guns you have ? 
  test them on us !, 
  :d '' have some sensibility please ; fine if you think the shooters shot because they felt pressures , but there 's a big reason why the pressures were there , and , for that matter , the protest-pressure was n't the only one . 
  `` the protesters wanted it '' seems fundamentally foolish . 
  nice idea , thanks . 
  more of a guillaume , really . 
  you think you 're mocking / r/europe . 
  huh . 
  well . 
  yeah , that attitude . 
  you know you could have chosen not to come to this part of reddit , to this thread only to cry about how everything is about you but that not everyone sucks your national dick enough . 
  wait , what do you consider mainstream media ? 
  first three ` mainstream media ' outlets ( volkskrant , reuters , bbc ) that popped in my head do refer to it . 
  fyi ; the downvotes are because you * automatically * assumed a `` help help i 'm being oppressed '' attitude . 
  i hope not . 
  d : though would n't mad sort of force any party to stay with somewhat more conventional materials ? 
  that is , until one side feels * really * threatened . 
  makes me feel bad i 've been playing red alert . 
  unwanted strangers , exploited and dangerous, 
  because while no-one allows the eu to ` meddle ' , everything that goes wrong is still the eu 's fault . 
  ... the whole point was probably to go and get arrested . 
  makes her minor kerfuffle in a far more visible fuss . 
   thing is largely a difference in language seems so . 
  the corrolary is that a european is going to assume `` they 're from italy '' if they claim to be italian . 
  no but seriously , it 's actually making me almost consider looking that way for when i pick up education again . 
   this kind of sets the tone for this article . 
  title already does that . 
  `` bullying , propaganda '' . 
  superpower so certain upstart colonies can be returned to their proper place . 
  web of trust plug in in feuerfuchs, 
  death . 
  fairly sure there 's only two tiers ; peasant and stephen fry , so of course they 're peasant-tier . 
  like half the mods are brits , dude . 
  little wonder then that my ` web of trust ' thingie listed it as yellow . 
  aiite on child safety , but `` ehhhh , not really '' on ` trustworthiness ' . 
  viewed from the nl , swedish society seems lagom functional . 
  god damn , 2 million ? 
  are they trying to make the alternative seem preferable ? 
  got any 20 pound coins ? 
  ecce sniffing finger in public, 
  this has to be it indeed , it makes even me start humming ` alons enfants etc ', 
  it 's not an argument . 
  hammond looks like he 's on stilts . 
  dunno , i can easily understand cda and vvd seeing it as a stab given that without pvv support it became demissionair . 
  besides that , i vaguely recall pvv dropping an important promise practically at the start , but i do n't remember well enough what that was . 
  kind of assuming those parties will do anything rather than cry and then break up a functioning government for attention . 
  fair enough , i bet it does look like that . 
  that does n't make / u/neoliberal 's post anything but self-congratulating twaddle , though . 
  no , absolutely not . 
  nope , merely getting tired with the british idea that everything in / r/europe is about them . 
  yes , it does . 
  it absolutely does . 
  even the post going `` why is so much here about britain '' you wank at `` because / r/europe is mean and hates us : c '' . 
  it 's not , say , because english is most spoken here , allowing many britons to make threads or anything like that ? 
  it 's a goddamn conspiracy because * everything * is about britain . 
  well that 's ludicrously arrogant . 
  `` anything i do n't like has to be because people hate my country and want to cash in on that '' . 
  in fact , this shit may well be why some members seem ` anti-uk ' ; you tossers are fucking arrogant . 
   everyone here against the freedom of speech ? 
  and without jesus the inquisition would n't have happened . 
  clearly jesus christ is on the same level as torquemada . 
  just a troll , surely no one would put darwin in the same line as hitler ? 
  which is why they made client kingdoms of previously-independent nations . 
  * beret of poodle on my noodle, 
   are we all going to die ? 
  what , you think germany tells people to be anuses on news article ? 
  i 'm fairly sure they can do that on their own . 
  i read ` snowden ' as ` sweden ' at first and was mighty confused . 
  then i realized it said ` snowden ' and i was still confused . 
  hey . 
  seriously , someone gets mentioned and it 's switzerland bashing ? 
  easily offended , you are . 
  was n't he fairly healthy when he studied ? 
  i just realized that a large part of my choco is swiss . 
  toblerone 's nice and all but the vast majority of my chocolate-intake has nothing to do with switzerland . 
  interesting !, 
  also looked it up on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_intercalated_games#highlights ) and he was a gold medallist in triple jump as well . 
  edit ; also france won by a rather large margin . 
  :o thanks !, 
  only the tilburg group , i guess , 'cause / u/lobotomobility could only find them . 
  if it manages not to collapse, 
  for fuck 's sake , or engage them in conversation instead of dismissing them as `` slur of choice '' . 
   the liberal party ( vvd ) wants a special police department that only targets ethnic minorities . 
  plus watching the autopsy is probably quite instructive . 
  wait up , there 's more polish words than ` kurwa ' ? 
  downvotes prove it 's not germans who lack a sense of humour . 
   braveheart ( semi-fictionalised history ) slightly historically-based fiction . 
  yes !, 
  they all live at the edges , so much room for activities !, 
  yes . 
  i think i oversimplified it a bit , thinking `` but there 's plenty empty room '' . 
  did n't think of possible water problems . 
  eh , overpopulation seems quite subjective . 
  i 've read australians saying their empty pit of a country is ` full ' . 
  witty . 
  but , there is none .
