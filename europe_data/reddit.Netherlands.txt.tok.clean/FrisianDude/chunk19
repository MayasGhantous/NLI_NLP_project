  of course there 's a difference , there 's no stereotype regarding swedes and scots as often being in food service . 
  one of the other three nam kee 's ? 
  i thought about gordon brown . 
  how can you not like gordon ramsey ? 
  man 's hilarious , and an awesome chef . 
  are the wordsies too naughty-waughty for your earsy-wearsies ? 
   and nothing in frisian because nobody would be able to read it anyways . 
  sad :(, 
   i honestly think french people hate english people way more than we hate you . 
  lol the fuck no . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm not going farther than its title `` who will stop islam '' . 
  you may not be prejudiced , but this guy absolutely is . 
  mind you that 's not why i 'm not continuing , i have to sign in on youtube for it but do n't currently like gootube enough to do so . 
  :p but some prejudiced guy making an opinion piece is not ` statistics ' . 
  statistics ? 
  show them . 
  or do they only exist in your mind ? 
  saying no pole does that is as dumb as saying every muslim does that . 
   i 'm not speaking about polish immigrants . 
  they actually work very hard and never live from social support . 
  you know who i am speaking about . 
  lol , seriously . 
  poles have basically the same reputation as what you 're now using against ` those immigrants ' . 
  but because you 're polish the stereotype about polish immigrants is obviously not true , but the one about muslim immigrants is . 
  thanks . 
  will they start shooting a few days afterwards ? 
  lol , ` slave soldiers ' , but i guess there might be a point . 
  as if italy needs * foreigners * to provide crime . 
  where 's the fun without the scots ? 
  the trickiest part there might be finding a clear day in scotland . 
  france . 
  hey , 24 years and two days is not that distant . 
  and still working on the time majigger . 
  i just think about things . 
  plus it 's not like i 'm in there for ages . 
  i hardly ever take anything with me to the loo while doing the business . 
  it just makes me feel a bit nasty , honestly . 
  i thought it did n't , but not sure . 
  fair enough , i just thought the german army was far larger what with it 's draft and all . 
  germany to a lesser extent than britain ? 
  you sure ? 
  we 're also talking about spying here and nothing short of a very good reason is a good enough reason . 
  i honestly doubt watching internet in real time is all that useful to prevent bombings . 
  yeah , maaaaybe if they have very strong suspicion about someone to be put under surveillance it could help catch them . 
  but it can only be useful when it 's a very small net . 
  i remember when the dutch new chip-card public transport system came to being and i tried to board the way-too-fucking-early-in-the-morning bus with my school card . 
  not really related to thread subject , but it is to your post . 
  socialism ai n't what it used to be . 
  :p but those sound only like ` sort of leftish of center ' to me , which indeed is n't very catchy . 
  is n't ` socialism ' by itself ` anticapitalist left ' ? 
   dutch 80.7 % , eu 5 % , indonesian 2.4 % , turkish 2.2 % , surinamese 2 % , moroccan 2 % , caribbean 0.8 % , other 4.8 % ( 2008 est. ), 
   on a completely unrelated note , apparently frisian is closer to english than it is to dutch . 
  sort of . 
  at it 's root , yes , west-germanic branch has two main offshoots ; dutch-german branch and anglo-frisian brand . 
  but there should be little doubt that over time small languages feel a lot of influence from larger languages around them . 
  dutch in itself has had a sizable influx from english , german and french among others , but frisian has had centuries of influence mostly from dutch and frisian adapts a lot to dutch . 
  's not to say there are no differences , but frisian has come a lot closer to dutch than it once was . 
  i thought it was all interesting , i think most did n't really understand you meant internalized homophobia / think the people in question may well have been worse off . 
  though only the initial one was downvoted heavily , right ? 
  aww . 
  :( if it 's any help ; you 're +26 on my res and i like your posts . 
  wish i could help you go to someplace sane though . 
  i always assumed the oldest guy had the dutch name everywhere because i thought the reference makes sense anyway ; nestorix . 
  assurancetourix and abraracourcix are usually not translated ( though the puns do n't carry ) , but in a few i 've seen the bard called ` kakofonix ' but i do n't think that 's any better . 
  what 's the smith and the fish monger in french ? 
  in dutch they 're hoefnix ( hoef = hoof so works for a smith and the total is also similar to ` hoef niks ' ; do n't need anything ) fishguy is kostunrix . 
  ( kost un rix -  kost een riks with ` riks ' being an old term for an amount of money . ), 
  one of my favourite has to be the frisian translation for panoramix ( the druid of the village ) or maybe for a different druid ; sopinblix . 
  soup-in-can . 
   english translations please . 
  this may be part of the problem ; i dare suppose most french literature does n't get translated all that much . 
  i 'd sooner bet on the dutchies not really giving a damn , most flemish i 've heard were quite distinct in their flem-ness . 
  but now that you mention it , we have plenty of faux-flemings even within our borders . 
  they should learn dutch or get out . 
  would n't matter much if they did . 
  only because no one ever heard yours . 
  flat land best land . 
   it 's a surprise that the media does n't cover it pressured to help prevent sgp-led lynch mobs . 
  oh yeah , i know what you mean . 
  i was just being obtuse . 
  [ also anglo-example .

  interesting idea , definitely , looking at your post again though , why does infrastructure etc fall under local/municipal ? 
  would n't especially infrastructure and power supply be far more efficiently done by national government ? 
   let 's say the front of the shirt is beer only with britain , ** holland ** , ireland , germany , ** netherlands ** , austria , czech republic , poland , belgium , france etc. 
  i think i like most of this , but i 'm not sure about the first . 
  because remove kebab, 
  y' all should just fall back in line with the frisians . 
  remove submission . 
  no hair , no mouths . 
  i maaay have skimmed over that part . 
  sorry that i 'm arguing stuff without quite knowing what i 'm talking about . 
  oh absolutely there are problems . 
  but going ` things might not improve unless ... ' is better than ` things will get worse anyway . ', 
  huh , okay then . 
  he a big figure ? 
  i dunno , seems to me trust is a big factor . 
  and if talking heads are going to keep going `` it 's only going to get wooooorse '' then trust wo n't regrow . 
  oh yep , i got what you meant . 
  i simply woke up too recently to make myself more clear , my bad .
