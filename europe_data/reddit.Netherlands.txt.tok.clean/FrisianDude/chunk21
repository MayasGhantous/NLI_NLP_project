  ahh , snugger . 
  edit ; come to think of it , the same works for a lot of dutch words . 
  i 'm fairly sure that joke is too shitty for this sub . 
  i love the face on that seal , really i do . 
  from one wall to another ? 
  wall-fetishist . 
  * the *, 
  why the second p in stopp ? 
  what sense does that make ? 
  someone needs to do actual work . 
   afaik `` neger '' is not a slur in dutch . 
  sort of . 
  anything is a slur when said with sufficient vitriol . 
  intent matters . 
  but yeah , neger is more or less ` negro ' whereas ` nikker ' would be ` nigger ' . 
  lol, 
  that 's how i reasoned it further , yeah . 
  allowing other people the same rights as me does not devalue my rights . 
  like , not in the slightest . 
  disappointment . 
  yeah but thirty year olds are less likely to stand in the middle of the aisle at a supermarket to drivel nonsense about their uneventful day than old people are . 
  among others . 
  gamersgate to a lesser extent , and i recently got sc + bw from blizzard itself . 
  ( ; __ ; ) 7  off topic , i love dutch people !, 
  joooooin ussss, 
   you mean you guys actually hate being called hollanders ? 
  factual incorrect is worst kind of incorrect . 
   my whole life was a lie !, 
  of course , belgium . 
  non-steam mastermaster pc masterrace . 
  two flemings called me a hollander , so the lot of them can rot . 
  ah , yes . 
  rather than increasing security for a few , take away something nice from many . 
  which one ( s ) might you suggest as preferable alternatives , then ? 
  rotterdam is a great place for modern architecture . 
  also , why not the bulldog ? 
  good show , then . 
  depends a spot on what you like of course , but there 's a rather nice and somewhat particularly dutch architecture in fortification . 
  like the zwolse ( pertaining to zwolle ) [ sassenpoort ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/sassenpoort ) , the amersfoorter [ koppelpoort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koppelpoort ) , het [ muiderslot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muiderslot ) and [ slot loevenstein ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loevestein ) . 
  which rather interest me . 
  coincidentally i noticed last saturday that the first one of that little list was open to the public , so i took a peak inside . 
  but eh , not everyone might be interested in pretty buildings , and if they are not necessarily in fortifications . 
  amsterdam has some amazing buildings in its own right , as well , by the way . 
  and the larger churches and cathedrals all over the country tend to be impressive . 
  okay , that 's it . 
  i wonder if they have eleven cities . 
  someone put ` holland ' in belgium , ` netherlands ' in denmark and ` sweden ' in the netherlands . 
  we do . 
  it 's utrecht . 
  too terminator you mean, 
  also cause earthquakes , damage drinking water and shake up nature . 
  lol . 
  oh , that makes sense . 
  i mean , kind of rude to forbid a church congegration , especially for just singing too loud ? 
  indeed i should imagine allowing them the use of a real church would be better . 
  it is . 
  it absolutely is . 
  srsly @ that church . 
  ah yes , what better way to ensure interest in those things . 
  oh pleese , as if that 's not around when shitting into water . 
  i dunno , i can easily see virtue in complaining about essentially pointless ideas . 
  those dry shelves are what makes a toilet a real toilet . 
  ca n't stand the plop-whoops-water-up-my-anus ones . 
  how am i supposed to tell my diet is alright ? 
  huh ? 
  yeah . 
  a better thing to point at might be super indictments . 
  i guess that 's what happens when someone with some semblance of power gets mighty bored ? 
   the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
  and murdering your political opponents might well follow the same route . 
  i agree fully and enitrely . 
  except for the missile strike . 
  that 's just stupid . 
  interesting , definitely . 
  i wonder how it 'll go . 
  oh pish , get a real language already . 
  huh . 
  it 's just that swabians were ( are ? ), 
  an actual german people , but ` niemcy ' means ` mutes ' , does n't it ? 
  does szwaby count as a slur ? 
  if anything i 'd have thought niemczy ( not sure about spelling ) would be the slur . 
  you can actually submit quibbles to their site , ya know . 
  no wonder what ? 
  i mean , seems fairly interesting to me , both those things . 
  no interest in science ? 
  at all ? 
  :o not even fleeting ? 
  whatever this is , it 's definitely not a first . 
  scant surprise their baristas would go `` yeh no lol '' . 
  does n't surprise me . 
  it gets boring and lonely without anything to do . 
  i dunno , we had ` huidskleur ' crayons in the nl as well when i was a wee ` un and even that small i went `` how is this skin colour ? 
  it 's vaguely pink . 
  i do n't look like this , no-one i know looks like this '' and most kids in my class at the time where * white * . 
  do n't bullshit yourself . 
  / u/a-leamas said things plainly . 
  you overdid it , turning it into a personal thing . 
  the difference is n't the us flair , quit with the persecution complex . 
  the difference is that / u/a-leamas presented a general case , whereas / u/xenthe went straight for the throat with baloney `` let 's see how you 'd feel '' booboo-bullshit . 
  i did miss it , because i was born in dec. 1989 .
