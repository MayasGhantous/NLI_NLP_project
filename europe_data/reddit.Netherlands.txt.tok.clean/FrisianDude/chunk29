  ) , but simply that i go to bed almost every day , `` wow , that was empty and meaningless . '', 
  beneath the `` use subreddit style ' thingie in the sidebar there 's a thingie to change your ` flair ' . 
  [ viagraman ] ( http://imgs.obviousmag.org/archives/uploads/2005/seven/viagraman_1.jpg ), 
  i hate motiviation-letters . 
  `` why do you want to work at shithole inc. ? '', 
  `` i need money and something to do , jackass . '', 
  lucas is a biblical reference , though . 
  little surprise that the only lucas i know is a member of the sgp-youth . 
  who is ` we ' , flair plox, 
  how smelly can you get from second-hand smoke ? 
  unless you 're staying for hours in a dedicated smoking room , that is . 
  wut , how does it increase your cost of cleaning ? 
  well , that 's a reasonable comparison . 
  probably true , yes . 
  i was thinking too much of a city . 
  even here ` outlying ' ( a whole two km from the next one ! ), 
  villages sometimes have poor pt access . 
  public transportation can be improved . 
  yep , entirely true . 
  i just like storming brain about it . 
  i know , i was not entirely serious . 
  yet still , i can definitely see advantages ( in public health and environment as in a lot of other things ) in reducing the amount of cars . 
  yep , the prices of cigarettes and shag tobacco ( as in rolling tobacco ) get upped by the year . 
  right now i have 50 grammes of smoking tobacco for $ 8,40, 
  buses , bikes , trains , etcetera ? 
  i mean , i presume most exhaust fumes are in cities , and stay there mainly . 
  ban cars from cities , take the bike , take the bus ( i know , buses also create exhaust fumes . 
  but what , four , five times as much as a car ? 
  while also seating 10-to-50 times as much as a car . ), 
  oh right , yes he is . 
  :d nice one . 
  i did n't realize it had rapid popularity in much of europe ? 
  steve ? 
  but just a nod and a ` hoi ' or ` goedemorgen ' ca n't possibly violate any personal space , surely d :, 
  :( i actually rather like doing it , especially when getting a good response . 
  for world , there 's this baffling tendency to leave democratically elected leaders alone . 
  odd , ai n't it ? 
  sounds respectable , chapeau . 
  shame on you , lucius . 
  i thought you were a good guy , helping batman and all . 
  well , quite literally . 
  children are minors . 
  hyuckhyuck . 
  pube-cancer , surely . 
  as is the main argument for restricting circumcision ; your right to religion does not supercede the infant 's right to protection from non-essential surgical procedures . 
  try again , you utter cad . 
  [ you do n't eat pigs , we do n't eat pigs , why not not eat pigs together ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6qa-4pwdsg ), 
  it really did n't . 
  quelle surprise . 
  hey , while we [ 're talking , do danes ever say ` hello ' to strangers if they happen to glance at each other in the street ? 
  or check your ancestors . 
  i dunno , it must be a hell of a night if i suddenly woke up with a rijbewijs . 
  fairly sure i piss a higher promille of alcohol after a night out . 
  my head is n't stretchy enough , but i did know they market heineken as a luxury beer outside of the nl . 
  and 6 $ for a beer geeze louise . 
  i thought $ 2,50 / 3 was ludicrous ( given that you can get a six pack of cans for a little more ) . 
  :d i 'll keep it in mind . 
  \\ o / now i kind of want a basis for slavic languages . 
  i know tiny bits and bobs of some romance ones , germanics i 'm fairly okay with ( especially west-germanic , but i know next to nothing of ( yugo - ) slavic languages . 
  except ` pivo ' . 
  `` just that !, 
  i swear i 'm telling everyone , but nooo , like me , listen ... 
  i take it you agree , then ? 
  though google insisted it was bosnian , i presume the two sentences are quite similar in both croatian and bosnian ? 
  as a politician and therefore filled with hot air , quite possibly . 
  ook in engels ( natuurlijk ) : `` here lies bernard b. bun who was shot by a gun . 
  his name was really bell , but what the hell . '', 
  adres onbekend en post restante '' . 
  interesting to see how ( and if ) this will pan out . 
  a shitty ending to a shitty show with an unoriginally named protagonist ? 
  oh right . 
  lol , ` maximator ' even sounds like absolute vomit . 
  atlas sounds like it could be decent , but maximator ? 
  yeah no . 
  yeah , those commercials get on my nerves a bit . 
  chop them up first . 
  wha - jupiler is a bad beer now ? 
  it certainly is n't sold in the netherlands , as far as i know . 
  i rather like their logo , thougho . 
  ctrl + f ` heineken ' no , not yet ? 
  but that is if i only look at the title . 
  if it 's about get-drunk-fast-and-cheap beers , then it 's [ sch\u00fcltenbrau ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag-a8d264hg ) and comparable aldi and lidl beers . 
  and iirc ` pitt bier ' jumbo sells it for almost nothing for a crate of 24 . 
  :d what makes you think so , though ? 
  i 'm almost two minutes in now . 
  i ca n't understand a single syllable , but it all sounds good . 
  the emotion translates . 
  well , til . 
  they also have some french commercials on youtube . 
  maybe for the walloon-market , but i am surprised t hey 're not known in france . 
  but they 've been advertized a ` le bon bonbon napol\u00e9on ( sjlllup ) ' come to think of it , there 's even a brown salmiak-y version . 
  i bet you 're like two-face and the handsome part is the frisian part . 
  i see , fair enough . 
  do you think it 's one of the worst ones around , though ? 
  no. 9 is a bit depressing to me . 
  though he must have moved a while ago as the draft in the nl has been suspended for at least 6 years now ( i 'm giving this number because i understood this when i was 17 , 6 years ago ) and so he would n't have been drafted anyway . 
  what , you do that with reuters ? 
  it seems one of the most neutral and reliable sources to me . 
  it 's funny because it 's true . 
  rock , paper , scissors ya for it .
