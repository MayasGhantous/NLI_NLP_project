  thou shallt not kill . 
  at all . 
  yeah , i should have been a bit less strident . 
  however , if you thin that 's clear against homosexuality , then all the comments on sanctity of life etc should give some indication on its stance on suicide . 
  he still seems a cunt though . 
  saw it in / r/ainbow . 
  cunt . 
  like they said ; bible is far clearer on suicide than on homosexuality . 
  edit ; i was wrong and silly . 
  man was apparently not a christian but a `` practicing pagan '' . 
  a nude dude acting rude . 
  funnily , `` gjin oprjochte fries '' is more difficult than what is supposedly the hard part of the shibboleth . 
  a wily lot we are . 
  the man himself is named louis . 
  tv show be damned , it was about the person . 
  edit ; or remove the c.k. 
  then it 's about the show . 
  louie c.k. 
  is wrongo . 
  [ yes it is . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_ck ), 
  and guiness and comically violent stereotypes . 
  not mine , mullet-man . 
  piece of s\u00fakerboale , right . 
  louis is with an is . 
  ( as if there 's a point . ), 
  and most of the netherlands , of course . 
  i 'll be damned if utrecht does n't return to the proper frisian fold . 
  in fact , let 's take sleeswijk as well . 
  you can read it , ca n't you ? 
  meh , ` gezelligheid ' is n't all that far from ` gem\u00fctlichkeit ' imo . 
  the french are your family . 
  fucking cheating norse weegies, 
  how about this : the silly grinzers leave , but we keep the gas . 
  i just read  boris is n't running for a third term , so he wo n't be the incumbent in 2020 . 
  by reilly616 , so it really is n't a counter to boris . 
  ah , i see i have been out-pedanted . 
  provide the rule , please . 
  i just found three sources as reliable as yours using ` spain wins ' http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500290_162-6668182.html http://www.aolnews.com/2010/07/11/spain-wins-2010-world-cup/ http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/gallery/2010/07/11/ga2010071103265.html, 
  the danes win , denmark wins . 
  if the country was actually plural then it would be win . 
  like if the netherlands had won . 
  yeah , but that was added in the kitchen . 
  afaik , this is about pitchers on the table . 
  merely to prevent shit from coming into itsomehow ; the kitchen stuff is , no doubt , being used ( and thus overseen ) all the time by ( trained ) kitchen staff . 
   `` the country of human rights '' lol . 
  ca n't wait to see it . 
  and what does abercrombie think of this ? 
  like the locust squatting on the leaf . 
   it 's supporters openly talk of concentration camps for minorities , and turning them into soap . 
  o ______________ o, 
  ottoman empire has passed away by now . 
  yep , i think it does predate the crimean war . 
  of course , the ottoman empire has been a sick man for a long , long time . 
  joris bonson . 
  not enough people understand romanian to read that . 
  usually subsidised art works with grants , surely . 
  so the beatles would , even with subsidy , not have been created by a government ministry . 
  so you 're making a point , but not one that is quite attached to the topic . 
   i would consider being called a populist a compliment . 
  i would n't . 
  populist ideals tend to be the ideals of those who over-simplify things to make for better slogans . 
  run around with our hair on fire , everything screeches to a halt , war will erupt and hunger will sweep the lands . 
  doubt it . 
  in dutch ` as ' can be used for both those meanings of axis and also for ` ash ' . 
  i 'm slightly surprised ` german ' is supposedly an ` east european language ' . 
  the ` ancient greek soldier ' is a bogglingly bad costume . 
  damn , that 's stupid . 
  really ? 
  what parents ? 
  does last sunday , 5/5/2013 liberation day still count ? 
  :p otherwise , do n't know any news . 
  the reigns of the two queens anus . 
  mother and daughter , you see . 
  well , i hate to say it , * duh * . 
  not sure in how far that should be a joke . 
  damn , you uncovered the big anti-uk conspiracy . 
  that 's a far nicer flag than hurr durr yellow bicolor . 
  savonian , though ? 
  when i saw your message ( without flair ) i thought you might mean an italian example ( with savoy ) , but yo 're a finn . 
  also , ` een ei ' is an egg , though ` ijs ' is simply ice . 
  the bugger being from the village down the road is far worse than him being slightly darker skinned . 
  wtf @ discrepancy nl and belgium . 
  [ look at this post , orchid-love . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1dv30w/literal_translations_of_chinese_names_for/c9u64ok ), 
  ijsland in dutch . 
  island is eiland . 
  yeah , space elves or space hippies . 
  elzas-lotharingen should be dutch . 
  yars . 
   lots of alcoholic beverages \\ o / speaking of which , i shall finish my coffee and avaunt into the bustling metropool of zwolle in order to catch some sun . 
  the fuck, 
  possibly because a lot of monetary transaction is done electronically wise now . 
  i 've never felt like i had to carry two hundred euros on me , to be honest . 
  heck , i 've lived large parts of my life without any actual coins or notes . 
  me too , plus , you know , it gives an extra little piggy bank in case it 's necessary . 
  quite a lot of my ` special ' coins are two euro-ones , after all . 
  i love finnish ones , with the lion with the armoured sword-arm . 
  also out of touch , i suppose . 
  just saw it on the news here .
