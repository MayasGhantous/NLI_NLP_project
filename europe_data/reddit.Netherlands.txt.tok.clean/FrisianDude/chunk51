  collect your clogs near the exit . 
  well til . 
  i have always thought it was a socialist one , given its title . 
  thanks !, 
  these two , being the gracchi , would applaud that , though , rather than frown on it . 
   wait , that 's not how we do it ? 
  ` have you said ' , or ` did you say . ', 
   did you just said english is hard ? 
  oh irony of ironies , all is irony . 
  i do n't even really know who the bugger is . 
  first time i heard of this was right here . 
  :p edit ; volkskrant.nl ( originally a socialist , still somewhat left-leaning major newspaper ) has dedicated it 's front page on the internet to this . 
  they claim she 'll declare abdication at 19:00 here , and would abdicate later this year . 
  gee , maybe because they pretend they 're being persecuted because people have started mentioning `` not everything is about the anglophones , you know . '', 
  because it is n't . 
  get over it . 
  / r/europe brits are defensive as fuck , especially lately . 
  :p i noticed that recently as well . 
   are lining up to attack what i 've been saying in this thread not just you , not just this thread . 
  ahh , the way various uk people are arguing in this thread , up to and including trying to redefine history , rather shows just * why * so many might be just a little bit tired . 
  or that one time when the french crown took , after roughly 100 years of warfare , all english holdings in france ? 
  capitalize your damn i 's already . 
  in the netherlands we have both this * and * coin-in-cart-to-use-cart-return-cart-to-retrieve-coin . 
  'cause every cart has a small chain , and if you stick that in the front of another cart , it pushes the inserted coin out again . 
  ( and is too short to push in the cart it is hanging from . ), 
  i did n't even read the first cross that far , i just saw ` memes ' and went to the second , tbh . 
  intelligent discussion and memes ? 
  a tricky place . 
  a skin like a bucket ? 
  as a dutchie ; like the uk 's belgium . 
  pretend not to belong , and have better beer . 
  meme central ? 
  i 'll pass , thanks . 
  haha , i did mean austria , but more because of how the table is filled . 
  apologies , that 's a very valid want , but i seem to have lost the source and only had the picture left . 
  well , damn . 
  sorry , i thought the big idea was to keep your titles as close to the submission as possible . 
  :p so i went with the somewhat scifi sounding table one : access to documents . 
  it seems odd at best that so many countries seem to have far less access to eu-documents than they perhaps should , and it also seems odd that there is one very notable exception , which apparently sends all top secret documents to its ` parliament/chambers ' . 
  this seems unwieldy and undemocratical . 
  i ca n't , the site sees to have got stuck . 
  :p i only managed to answer the first one , but that one also points out i do n't entirely fit the demographic . 
  wha - i 'm a dutch student studying to become a teacher ( history ) in the netherlands , and this rather baffles me , there must have been a good amount who just made it a joke . 
  hm , how ? 
  but at least , they brag , they do n't stop for the snow . 
  glad to be of service . 
  ca n't say i noticed that . 
  yyep , just thought i 'd provide some closure . 
  i do agree , indeed , it 's something the nl should fix . 
  previous and similar threads : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/16hwhr/prevent_the_privatization_of_water_in_europe/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/16s5ca/the_eu_is_trying_to_privatise_water_wtf_is_going/, 
  little wonder , of course , and i doubt this is surprising news to anyone , but i thought it 'd be logical to post this as well , given how much attention and debate [ the original thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/16r07r/muslim_patrol_vigilantes_attempt_to_control/ ) and the [ mosque condemns ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/16sanw/east_london_mosque_condemns_patrols_and_urges/ ) thread recieved , the subject is interesting to / r/europe . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  that 's ... pretty stupid as well . 
  well , yes ? 
  at least , if said companies are headed by portuguese who then decided to move to a tax haven , then yes . 
  clearly the nl should also work to be less of a tax haven , i suppose , but would the same who moved here to avoid paying taxes in pt then not simply move elsewhere ? 
  simply an available plot , i assume ? 
  what 's the bus system like in ireland ? 
  that house actually looks tidy . 
  and other than the text , it looks like it could be an unfinished village neighbourhood here in the nl . 
   it 's a sadistic story , and france wants it : what a godawful title . 
   and the `` western '' world , i.e. 
  the anglo-saxons please do n't say that . 
  said anglos are too full of themselves already . 
   makes sense to do these during colder months . 
  sleeping with wet hair is stupid . 
  hard to brush back into some semblance of order , but otherwise i have little problems there . 
  i know , and they 're parts of the eu because they 're parts of eu-countries . 
  malinois there is simply a poor rendition of ` mechels ' :p, 
  ah , i was confused . 
  in dutch we refer to them as ` vrijmetselaars ' but when it pertains to them , it 's `` ma\u00e7onniek '' and the cedille intrigued me so much that it confused me in a different language . 
  :p thanks . 
  i was n't sure about the spelling , it might be maconic as well . 
  but yeah , freemasons . 
  * the * subject of so many conspiracy theories .

  hedgehogs . 
  < 3  i wonder who `` they '' who cry and moan are in this statement . 
  why , the zionist/maconnic nwo , of course . 
  it 's probable that there are some economic factors which help make france slightly more eager to keep that area france-friendly . 
  nono , see , saudi arabia is literally mordor . 
  and those are not independent nations . 
  that 's a waste of good beer . 
   the captions were a bit repetitive though : snow-covered x stands on snow-covered y with snow-covered z in background . 
  and half the time in the uk . 
  :( kinda rude . 
  yep , just subscribed as well after readingthis one here . 
  we have one in a coma , if you want a calm one . 
  well , yeah , but it 's still a pic of him after a plane crash . 
  you can have the whole lot for all i care . 
  oh shit , that one is great . 
  or , gee , because he 's effectively proposing the eu becomes part of the anglosphere .
