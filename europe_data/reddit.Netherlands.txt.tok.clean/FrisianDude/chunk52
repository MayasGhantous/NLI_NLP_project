   can we drop the empire thing ? 
  almost every time i see it mentioned it by someone who is n't british , its like you guys want to force the idea on us again . 
  given that there 's a thread by someone who thinks it 's okie-daisies to invite far flung ex-colonies of the uk into the eu just because they are far flung ex-colonies of the uk . 
  bet you $ 5 that no spaniard would make a thread in / r/europe suggesting mexico be allowed in the eu . 
   where i stand on the issue . 
  nowhere , you ` resittingdown . 
  i do n't want to think this is funny . 
  i mean , he barely survived a plane crash , no wonder he 's standing there like a crumpled up zombie . 
  you can check out any time you like , though . 
   is this cult of personality normal in other european countries ? 
  as a dutchman , nnno . 
  mind you , there has been some veneration , like pim fortuyn . 
  he got popular with rather populist rhetoric , got shot to death in the streets , and afterwards his party tottered on with `` pim would have wanted it this way ; ___ ; '' whenever they made some dubious decision . 
   the popular mood 's just about on the side of staying in europe - but federalisation ? 
  you must be mad . 
  he did n't actually say that federalisation was most popular , but merely that it was more popular then mrh12 's opinion . 
  already have a queen and country , bruv . 
  or the * point * of the union , perhaps . 
  pfft , let them form their own anglophone club instead . 
  always with you anglophones trying to make everything anglophone !, 
  pshaw , bosh and flimshaw . 
  ... cool . 
  funnily as well , the italian company has `` breda '' in its name , which is also a dutch city . 
  emulated from russia , usually , right ? 
  that too . 
  now i 'm going to have to read the best page again . 
  true , true . 
  but you said `` makes it easy '' rather than `` makes it slightly less difficult '' :p, 
  the use of 4chan shizzle , more . 
  :p plus , in english `` that feel '' really ought n't be accepted , dammit , it 's `` that feeling '' . 
  netherlands ; no enforced conscription . 
  indeed so . 
  but the foundations are there . 
  :p when i turned 18 i received a letter stating that conscription was postponed but that i was eligible to be called upon later should the need arise . 
  i expect more countries have similar ? 
   i would argue that although we may not have mandatory military service , for millions the military is their only real option in life . 
  sounds more like a social problem than a military one . 
  i doubt it . 
  no politicians wants to be the one to recieve the blame after botched or failed military operations ; it 's tricky at best to try to get your country to war in most of europe . 
  what the fuck does tfw mean ? 
  and so the dutch get the glory . 
  yeah . 
  :p only the vatican and swiss ones are square . 
  that second picture ( from the top ) shows an incredible discrepancy in the height of the soldiers . 
  funnily , everyone of those except for switzerland and the vatican city is wrong .

   as to my proud flag : we stole the colours , and tricolour , from the dutch . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  yugoslavia used our combination without authorisation .

  i 'd be surprised if he had anything to do with it . 
  that was kinda cool . 
  while i can understand being concerned about orange 's move , i 'm really not sure you should cheer on google instead . 
  yeah , but i also play it just for the radio sometimes . 
  hence why i said `` learn more about their own currency '' . 
  i can understand not being sure if you do n't know anything about it , but earlier people said `` i do n't want to take it because no-one else will '' , which seemed childish , everyone 's better off if they know that it is valid legal tender . 
  even if that means a cashier handing that over to a customer , even if that means a shop owner has to explain it is real . 
  but that is beyond the original point about the euros , they were also saying people would not accept foreign euros . 
  and that is childish , because if you join the euro you ca n't not know that other countries also circulate euros and that those also would be legal tender . 
  yeah , i sometimes have my alarmclock/radio on classical station as well , but it gets shit range so it 's usually just kgggzzztt . 
  oh well , the internet has a lot of music . 
  ooh , close . 
  actually slightly earlier ; december 1989 . :p i 'll try antena 2 later , though i probably would n't be able to understand the in-between song talking radio staitons usually do . 
  meh , imo / r/europe has enough loonies that additional trolls are n't necessary . 
  makes it difficult to tell which one is serious . 
  it 's nice-ish , but not quite [ nice enough to stop holst for ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahvsszw7nds ) . 
  :p ( i 'm not from the 70s : i ), 
  eh , never liked him much either . 
  lacked subtlety , imo . 
  more specifically ( though you 're right ) ; poorly educated . 
  beliefs can fuck a person , i do n't think it was intended quite as you say here . 
  quit trolling dude , you 're better than ulemad . 
  it should never have been more than the ecsc . 
  sounds like the entire country needs to a ) learn more about their own currency and b ) grow the fuck up . 
  this all seems extremely farcical . 
  i never understood that either . 
  the scotch and irish notes are legal tender in all of the uk , yes ? 
  and of equal value as english notes , yes ? 
  then how the fuck can people just go `` i do n't want those , they 're foreign '' when it 's the same value , the same note ? 
  at most they should go `` oh , hey , that 's a scottish one , cool , do n't see them much . '', 
   what i meant in my first post was that during the transition , people would go out of their way to make life as awkward as possible for euro users . 
  buh-wuh-what ? 
  i mean , i can understand legitimate opposition to the euro , but that is just petty . 
  : s ofcourse there would be a transition period though ( even if the population supported it ) . 
  dang , that 's pretty terrible . 
  eh , when the jerries had their ehec crisis they blamed the dutch as well . 
   i 've read that the `` meat '' is actually blasted off the skeletons with high pressure water jets ... awesome . 
   and can elaborate further if you 'd like ? 
  i did n't want this twaddle in the first place , i was merely saying that joining a monetary union is rather pointless if the people then do not accept foreign versions of the same fucking coin . 
  if majority does n't want it should n't be implemented , certainly , but some sort of almost mercantilist `` those foreign coins look too foreign '' attitude seems very , very odd indeed . 
  especially seeing as it 's the same coin with the same value . 
  looks rather usual `` britain is different so nyeh '' to be honest . 
  if the uk were to join the euro those shenanigans should be stopped immediately , what a load of shit that they 'd somehow only accept uk-made eurocoins . 
  but this was about u.k. - euros and a euro penny would be patently ludicrous . 
  seriously ? 
  if england would join the euro , there would be english shops refusing to accept non-english euros ?

  altgr + 5 = $ ( even says so on the key , never noticed until i tried . ),
