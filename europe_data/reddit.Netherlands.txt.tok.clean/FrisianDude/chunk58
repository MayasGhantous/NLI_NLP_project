  that does n't mean a lot of dutch folk object though . 
  some people , usually with poor english , only use hollander , true , and it is used very commonly . 
  but it 's still wrong-o . 
  i smoke cigarillos . 
  i can get pot quite legally in about fifteen minutes . 
  a fair point , i was being slightly pedantic rather than answer , previously . 
  however , i often wonder how much damage smoking does to health - in general - . 
  clearly the person smoking is damaging themselves significantly , but i wonder in how much smoking hurts general health or air quality , especially when compared to particulates and such . 
  a lower water level , possibly because the first pic seems stormy . 
  very nice pics , though . 
  true , it does n't tend to . 
  but that 's out side that particular reason i was attacking ; it 's a different reason entirely . 
  preferably not . 
  less hyped-up overattention on it might be nicer . 
  that is silly . 
  genuinely silly . 
  i also hope they 're not going to escalate this in level ; i am rather partial to vanilla-y cigarillos . 
  besides that , most young people who start smoking tend to smoke ` normal ' . 
  or quickly develop a habit for rolling their own , even . 
  not sure if you can even get flavoured loose tobacco ( speciality shops , perhaps ) . 
  and the sentence `` if it 's tobacco , it should look like tobacco and taste like tobacco , '' is idiotic unless he eats all his food unseasoned and possibly raw . 
  also no flavoured waters or milk for him . 
  or milk chocolate , chocolate should taste pure !, 
  i never even commented here though i 've had the thread open for the ten days it exists !, 
  silly me , but i want to say that this is very cool . 
  i do n't usually hear much about liet , but i think this is a very interesting subject and a rather nicely written article about it . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  no , that would be you ca n't * keep * your cake and eat it too . 
  you can have a cake and intend to eat it . 
  oh come on . 
  this is n't anti-racism out of proportion , it 's just a shithead who thinks he 's funny . 
  that does n't really matter , as it 's about accent . 
  which is formed mostly in certain sounds , and it could easily be that most brits make roughly the same sound ` mistakes ' . 
  in your own speaking there might be vast differences , but when speaking another language it 's possible that the same accent-factors are present all over britain . 
  kinda like in the netherlands ; there is the idea that there is a dutch accent for english . 
  does n't mean all dutch dialects can be understood by everyone . 
  when i was in maastricht i had a hard time understanding what them limburgers said , even though they were speaking ` proper ' dutch . 
  they also had trouble understanding what i said in ` proper ' dutch . 
  ( edit to clarify ; this is about the bildts dialect , which is dutch-frisian , not about the frisian language . ), 
  i ca n't say * ich bin ein friesenjung * really describes me , though . 
  :p i rather like coffee , for one . 
  i 'm dutch , most schools do have gates . 
  especially around the bike-parking areas . 
  d'you mean the frisians , or the dutch ? 
  that ... makes sense , but is n't what the actual sentence says . 
  you 're probably right , though . 
  ` plenty of other factors . ', 
  i rather like chunky ( appelcomp\u00f4te we say with loaned french in dutch ) . 
  i said ` the gist ' . 
  so it 's clearly a simplification . 
  two years ago i was walking late in the evening in maastricht and a beggar walked up to me . 
  to show off the sandwhich someone gave him . 
  the man was over the moon that someone gave him a sandwhich . 
   how can it be solidarity if one is paying a different tax rate than the others ? 
  rather easily . 
  the gist of the argument is that the richer help support the poorer by paying more . 
  which is a perfect example of solidarity ; shared suffering is weakened suffering . 
  that makes it sound as if they just sprinkled peanut-dust over your fries rather than the dollop of thick sauce it should be . 
  that does look delicious . 
  catholic are christian , dude . 
  well , that was dross . 
  islam is not a threat ; a tendency to fundamentalism is . 
  this tendency is not islam-specific . 
  it is not an invasion , either , nor is it an ideology . 
  it 's a religion , with all the flaws a religion has . 
  totally antagonistic to enlightenment ? 
  sure , i can see that . 
  but again , that is mostly the tendency to fundamentalism . 
  it was not , however , enlightenment philosophy which brought europe to preeminence . 
  it was good old fashioned warfare . 
   you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  imo , this is the worst phrase in the english language . 
  that 's what cake is for . 
  i think part of it is also a ( perceived ) hostility which simply makes immigrants dig their heels in even further . 
  which is why i personally think people like wilders are idiots ; he 's exacerbating his pet-peeve problem rather than working to solve it . 
  delicious shame . 
  it is a great combination and i stand by it !, 
  yeees ? 
  that 's nothing special . 
  : o it gets special when i tell people i sometimes have peanut butter on my pancakes . 
   rather than a standalone snack like , just spoon it out of the pot ? 
  that would get mighty boring mighty fast . 
  i 'm dutch and usually get sat\u00e9 sauce with my fries . 
  that 's too early . 
  lunch is between 12:00 ( though that 's early ) to 14:00 . 
  well , not necessarily the entire time , but that 's the time frame . 
  ... you silly sausage . 
  nnnno , honey melts . 
  but then it 's just slightly flavoured warm milk . 
  i ca n't stand warm milk unless it 's heavily chocolated . 
  tea goes without milk . 
  milk goes without tea . 
  i 'm dutch , do n't drink wine much , and all of those baffle me . 
  i 've never heard of adding anything to wine . 
  what 's next , beer without alcohol ?

  edit , neither work . 
  just google them . 
  :p our leverpastei is probably practically the same as the danish leverpostej , and our leverworst comes in a few variaties , but similar to leberwurst , of course of course .
