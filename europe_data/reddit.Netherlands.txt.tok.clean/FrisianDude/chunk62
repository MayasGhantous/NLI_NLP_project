  only less so . 
  not quite . 
  ehhh . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wiktionary:ipa_pronunciation_key unfortunately it does n't have this particular example . 
  as much as some people sometimes seem to overstate frisian as so much more ` scandinavesque ' than dutch is , in this case it might have produced a sensible reference point . 
  imagine next to the english ` two ' a frisian ` twa ' . 
  swedish still looks a lot like the russia ` dva ' ( obviously ) but it looks less ` out of place ' in the ( north ) germanic branches . 
  woah you almost exactly picked out ( my ) main ` these look like english/scots english ' . 
  frisian tsjerke looks and sounds more like english church ( same start sound ) but ` tsiis ' is even more similiar to the english one . 
  ` kakken ' is one of many ways to say ` taking a shit ' in dutch . 
   yep , it 's just you . 
  it being around henge would be kinda even cooler . 
  edit ; the site seemed kinda new agey fruity so i was n't sure if it was entirely reliable * hence i 'll take the liberty to add some other links http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/07/europe/new-superhenge-discovery/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34171326 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/archaeology/11844357/huge-ritual-monument-found-hidden-near-stonehenge.html https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3jxivx/4500yearold_megalithic_superhenge_found_buried/ ( lol meta ) http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/07/stonehenge-archaeology-ritual-arena-neolithic-monument ( ` ritual arena ' ? 
  fuck you say ) * mostly due to a comment by ` moonchild ', 
  weather prediction computer . 
  your username just reminds me of ` allo ` allo, 
  also under dutch law murder is n't allowed, 
  not saying he 's a plotting villain or anything , just ship him over . 
  nobody reads articles . 
  zis iz / r/europe . 
  piss off with your herbwater : u, 
  especially as large a grouping as ` slav ' . 
  hence why my wut . 
  i mean , it * is * , but that 's no slander on the slavs , or even particular to them . 
  which is why i did n't understand . 
  how is that hate ? 
  wut , you do n't like his jokes ? 
  yep , probably the french . 
  `` how many refugees ? 
   if you like beer . 
  and if you do n't you can leave europe for all i care . 
  i read this the moment my nose started itching . 
  clearly , you are a terrorist, 
  i see, 
  ah , much obliged . 
  it sounds en-chant-ing . 
  and even that , if we 're talking 20 years ( and it 's even true ) could be preventable within nigeria itself, 
  wait , how would sweden 's rape rate go * down * ? 
  at best , assuming that there are lots of rapists who then would n't come into sweden , it would n't go up . 
  rape rates not rising is obviously good , but not the same as going down . 
  surely the rapists in sweden are already there and would then be unaffected quite thoroughly by tighter borders, 
  to be honest i genuinely ca n't fault them for that . 
  simply because 1 ) closer destinations are also closer to the danger they 're fleeing 2 ) they are also often in comparable religious situations ( ie , a wrong brand of islam according to is and therefore a target ) and 3 ) refugees will often have heard , and frankly it 's true , that europe is the place to be . 
  so moving a few countries further seems the only logical option . 
  to them ` feeling at home ' ( ie , comfortable , not literally ) would be the main issue when they actually try to settle somewhere , and i assume they 'd have that issue anywhere anyway , so that would n't really stop anyone . 
  he did n't say the poles are the nazi 's . 
  i saw ob\u00c9lix, 
  is that also the same song ? 
  barely comparable situations . 
  pretty obvious he was n't talking about the colonizing but about the refugees who refuged there . 
  `` give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free . '', 
  is literally a statue of liberty thing . 
  flashmobs can be planned though ; they organised the music and then the ` mob ' , the audience mainly , gathered . 
  i used to have the same version bookmarked as ` som sabadell ' . 
  it * is * a banco sabadell idea . 
  do n't matter to me one fuck though . 
  i 'd skipped this for a few hours and now i fancied it because i reread my little joke . 
  i kinda already knew what it was gon na be . 
  all the better to tire your hand with !, 
  wait if the nazi 's were far left , what was the kpd ? 
  because many eastern european nations have ( significant ) russian minorities , i believe the thing is . 
  you know , after ten years of war and the trojans thinking it was a peace offering/offering to gods ? 
  uh what, 
  damn , dude got * sourced *, 
  oh yeah that is what i 'm doing . 
  i 'm saying `` his dad is not an evil man '' so clearly i 'm being emotionally manipulative , and a scumbag , and pushing my agenda . 
  piss well off now ; there is a fucking tragedy here and one of its victims suddenly gets the blame . 
  and i 'm using dead kids to push an agenda ? 
  no , i am not . 
  do n't be snide , you weenis . 
  i agree he took a risk , possibly made a mistake , but seriously that does not mean he 's this huge monster some commenters here seem to claim . 
  man is quite fucking likely torn with grief over his drowned child , his destroyed home , his destroyed homeland , his people shattered and he 's somehow the villain in all of this ? 
  look at ohthehorrors and zeta ' s posts above ehec . 
  wuuh, 
  literally 1984 just rename london to airstrip one, 
  rust in vredah . 
  aww ruff pups, 
  the great migration has been with us for centuries . 
  this is not that . 
  now it 's confirmed ; it 's a first world thing . 
  let 's send a letter of complaint to london that they should stop appropriating whining as a british specific thing . 
  nicely written in fraktur . 
  do n't give me that shit . 
  ` you guys ' is a specific and defined group of planks who * start a conversation by saying how desperately silenced they are by the evil leftists * . 
  and really not convinced anyone who mentions ` cool aid ' in that sense should give anyone else shit about tinfoil hats, 
  eh , why ? 
  i 'd completely forgotten about fritzl !, 
  is it just me who is not at all reassured by that excuse for a fence, 
  hm i see what you mean , come to think of it, 
   from reddit you would think all euros do hate us . 
  really ? 
  'cause it 's usually just criticism of something that raises a lot of american hackles about ` anti-american circlejerk ' . 
  tbh to me it always seemed as if there 's a larger ` anti - anti- american circlejerk ' than an ` anti-american circlejerk ' . 
  it 's `` far-left rah rah cool-aid '' and '' all racist fascists '' and `` at least that 's what this sub taught me . '', 
  that make anyone think that you guys , coming here with an instantly-beleagured attitude making assumptions rather than actually looking what a response might be , that you are `` raving '' . 
  west and east blame each other for the current neonazis, 
  cool . 
  :d i was just prodding to also provide that source, 
  is it ? 
  it says ` our recommended redraft ' .
