  whereas here among the mostly young social liberal people it 's mentioned like clockwork . 
  no it is n't peewee . 
  winterhold lacks the * style . 
  rising up over fields of cotton :o, 
  no it is n't . 
  that 's cleary artwork from a fantasy game . 
  with those helmets they might as well be droids . 
  it freezes in spain ? 
  how does this relate to the title or the article ? 
  now all that 's left is rope . 
  that 's almost the silliest conclusion to take . 
  the zombie plague affected many innocent people . 
  . . this is a bad title . 
  looks more like he 's dancing something mj . 
  why the weird pose on tsipras ? 
  ` boef ' is a rather silly reference to criminals in dutch . 
  i thought that in a thread about exactly this it was mentioned that the australian government manages to divert most boats to some offshore thing . \\, 
  while that is a good point , overpop has less to do with absolute numbers and more with whether the ecnomy can sustain them surely ? 
  young men 's cult ( of ) mel brooks , i assume . 
  i thought you were refering to the hideous footwear at first . 
  ... kill me now . 
  real original naming there . 
  i thought that was a form of ancient greek . 
  ... that some shit . 
   for obvious reasons . 
  you got rabies ? 
  yeah but to be fair it can be so busy that you do n't notice the bike lane until someone has already cycled up your leg and parked his front wheel in your armpit . 
  rude, 
  i like how you drink !, 
  look at her tiny flutethingie at 3:58 . 
  ( o\u03c9o ), 
  i recognize '' ` ollandik\u00e1 '' and '' \u00c9llenika '' so imma assume it 's the same sentence . 
  we 're not sauce dude . 
  * the once mighty army of azeroth lay among the blackened and charred remains of stormwind keep . 
  and then also boltered because genestealer . 
  that 's too creepy , pls dont . 
  their flag is lovely though . 
  in ck2 my halland united sweden and denmark . 
  once just like that , onece with the kingdom of lotharingia ( lol , elza\u00df rightful danish clay ) and once all of scandibravia . 
   have experience as a moderator ( or similar ) not very active subreddits . 
  sometimes had to delete some stuff . 
  / r/strips , for example , is * not * about strippers . 
   do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator [ 5 ] ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox [ 6 ] ) ? 
   what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
   what is your favorite/least favorite thing about / r/europe [ 7 ]  what could be implemented to make it better ? 
   what would make you a good moderator ? 
  not really . 
  gmt +1 favorite is that there 's always a good discussion to be found in / r/europe . 
  least favourite is that just as often there 's shitty ones , with people being overly personal and threads often looking like they 've been brigaded . 
  implemented ? 
  a wider coverage of timezones by moderators , possibly . 
  also , a well stocked bar and a boxing ring . 
  what would make me a good moderator ? 
  i usually try to be reasonable and often see and understand both sides to an argument , so i 'm not very likely to get ` drawn in ' . 
  and if i do get drawn in , i would do so as a user , not as moderator . 
  :o :d i quite liked most of it . 
  the exam was n't very hard imo, 
  ravel is also fairly well known . 
  ... also , b\u00e9la bart\u00f3k was part of the ` art ' exam today !, 
  ahahah buk you, 
  christ . 
  that 's more toff than the chocotoff factory . 
  ... the fuck, 
   ode to joy sung in any language other than german should be a crime . 
  and as much as i adore rowan atkinson his rendition was also criminal . 
  what the fuck, 
  i 've been fretting about my mortality since i was nine . 
  you can scratch ` northern ' from that . 
  ( titles within ) benelux , france , spain , the hre , bohemia , basically all over europe lions were one of the more common heraldic symbols . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ france ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ hre ^ ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ lions ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ their ^ ^ ^ big ^ ^ ^ flag , ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ many ^ ^ ^ titles ^ ^ ^ under ^ ^ ^ those ^ ^ ^ thrones ^ ^ ^ did . 
  * rohan * is in france . 
  * saruhan * was something in what 's now turkey . 
  * mordor * is now known as blackpool . 
  ... [ saucy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/troll_%28gay_slang%29 ) . 
  that does seem a very odd goal to try to reach . 
  to make as many people feel offended as possible . 
  perhaps some venting and ranting might be necessary . 
  in ranting someone might generalize , quite unintended , which might ruffle feathers . 
  i do n't really know if it 's wise to hold it separated but i can see some logic in it . 
  for that perhaps they thought a separate meeting might be useful first . 
  i can disagree with that , but i think / u/thecritic06 has a point , and if it really is * one event specifically for discussion of a particular type of discrimination amongst people who were or could be victims of it . 
  * i see little problem with it . 
  eventually though , what you say probably is necessary and i 'd raved to myself about exactly that when i had merely read the post 's title . 
  yeah okay , but still almost the same thing ; it seems much easier to me to get info from americans on this site than from north-africans . 
  am both burger and fries . 
  yes . 
  i know . 
  thank you . 
  piss off . 
  and actually no it is n't . 
  i confused you with the other guy asking stupid questions . 
  ` in that case ' refers to the flag . 
  look at the stripes . 
  then picture the polish and indonesian flags . 
  yeah no shit . 
  how is that a raise ? 
  if anything , i think i already know more about usa than about north africa and as such this might be less interesting . 
  poland and indonesia are clearly far more important us states , in that case . 
  upfeegled . 
  no questions , but thanks for the interesting thread and your honest answers !,
