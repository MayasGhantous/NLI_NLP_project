  the man just wants friggin sharks with friggin lasers . 
  non-affiliated i 'd guess . 
  not in themselves secular :p, 
  i want one . 
  i did n't even get that from the question . 
  fairly logical though since a mother can have a son and a daughter and genes probably ( i 'm no scientimatist ) did n't change in between . 
  hell , look at those fake two-eggy twins sometimes producing a goy and a birl . 
  pop density : \u00fe, 
  actually no of course, 
  i never said they were n't european . 
  i said that calling them ` elite ' somewhat suggests the rest of the elite accepted them as such . 
  no , but their leaders were , while educated and all , hardly accepted by the larger ` european elite ' . 
  i 'm like below -2 :(, 
  i thought skalpelis meant the commies, 
  so frilly < 3, 
  and i agree with all of that ( though the last point seems fatuous ; what pressure are western feminists going to put on sa or india ? ), 
  but that is more or less my point, 
  western sense of ` feminist ' is still not what so many redditors pretend it is . 
  ah , right . 
  i thought it was more like the noun carrier than a verb . 
  i thought the ` fer ' referred to carrying . 
  for lucifer both work , but i thought the fer was related to ` phoroi ' . 
   somniferum ` sleep-carrier ' ? 
  love the name . 
  pretty sure no-one is mocking you for * remembering * . 
  does it matter ? 
  ohh i thought it was just a mislink or something . 
  maintenanc makes sense . 
  thanks !, 
   it does n't fully satisfy the requirement for 360 degrees defence ( image [ 1 ]  ) - it 's focused in one direction while having very inferior capabilities in other directions ( note one big antenna and 2 small [ 2 ] ) these two links want me to provide authentication . 
  minefield !, 
  op there fuckn mangles the joke, 
  come to think of it , never . 
  i mean , they may be there , but i do n't usually see them . 
  ahh of course . 
  i should have thought of ` ontdekken ' . 
  ( to discover ), 
  is aufdecken ` to cover ' or ` to uncover ' ? 
  i thought the first , at first , because in dutch ` afdekken ' is ` to cover ' . 
  and ` op ' as ` ent ' , i guess ? 
  ` opdagede ' i did puzzle out to be something like ` discovered/foiled/noticed ', 
  i just need to do ` opdagede ' . 
  give me a moment , i 'm not the enigma-machine . 
  too little , too late . 
  i can read your words ah-ah-ah, 
  and even then . 
  a crossbow at short range ? 
  let the teachers be well padded and plated !, 
  denmark 's clearly better though . 
  's flat like proper countries should be . 
  does that matter ? 
  : o was it maybe your first one ? 
  i 'd have thought this one would be understandable if context was provided in the comments . 
  arse , you know that 's not what he said . 
   btw you know sub sahara is not a country right ? 
  hence ` the marvellous country ' . 
  i read it as dripping with sarcasm . 
  / u/aleixasv was pointing out that sub sahara is n't a country and if that 's as specific as it gets , then we do n't know where they 're from . 
  i was n't saying it was understandable for japan , but understandable for the person in question to flee so far . 
  it 's not just ` being out of range ' but also ` being far enough out of range to feel able to start a safer life anew ' . 
   what they are doing is like an iraqi fleeing isis and deciding that the best place to start a new life is japan . 
  understandable ? 
  bloody far away from the armed bastards sounds like a time-honoured plan . 
  because does boko haram mind borders ? 
  is kenya so much more stable ? 
  is it possible , when fleeing civil strife to simply rebuild in the next country over ? 
  look at comments here for example ; https://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/32y243/a_boastful_13yearold_boy_has_been_jailed_for_a/ there 's being against immigration and there 's that . 
  wot . 
  lul has no connotation outside ` penis ' . 
  also for unpleasant persons . 
   i think it 's only fair , if that land belongs to the municipality , they can dump whatever they want there . 
  surely that 's bound by legislation . 
  just throwing shit in such quantities on one spot ? 
  i doubt the municipality is allowed to dump it whereever :p, 
  tbh the breaking of molotov-von ribbentropp was probably stupider . 
  especially if , as ed __ says , nazi 's chance was mostly in having all of western europe before turning against the soviets . 
  that would be a no . 
  tbh i do n't think they went ` we need someone for the vatican , find a gay man ' . 
  seems more likely ` we need someone for the vatican , this guy 's good , and * he happens to be gay * . ', 
  i like capslock . 
  they make me feel important :(, 
  wtf is wrong with you idiots always going ` why not send him to x place where he will probably die ? 
  murat reis by the way was n't born under that name before anyone goes all ` see those foreigners in our country are all criminals ' :p edit ; woah . 
  i was gon na joke he was probably born as ` jan janssen ' or something ... he actually was born ` jan janszoon ' . 
  guess i remembered that better than i thought . 
   wan na know what remote control means ? 
  user manual is bedienungsanleitung . 
  i assume zuiper is dutch ( because the word would mean ` one who zuips ' -  ` one who drinks a lot ' ) and both are somewhat similar in dutch . 
  remote control being afstandsbediening and user manual usually just being ` manual ' ; handleiding . 
  's what i used to think due to ` krankzinnig ', 
  i think he might be joking . 
  ohhh . 
  i thought the suit was a taxi driver . 
  did n't pay much attention to the vehicle . 
  edit ; oops leftie is taxi . 
  mistake , not a lie . 
  top 5 on there seems a reason they should . 
  not a `` really should n't . '', 
  j' ai uhh had to look that up . 
  i read ` perterved ' as ` perverted ' .
