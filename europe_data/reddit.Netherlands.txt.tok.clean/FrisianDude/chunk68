  then stared at it a bit . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( whoop ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ there ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ goes ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ multilingual ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ cred , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ gerrammar ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ probably ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ off ) also do n't acknowledge that ` cerveza ' silliness . 
  they should just learn to say ` bier ' . 
  harrumph . 
  this is why you feckers send people who do n't speak german to listen to german speeches at a german press conference in german in germany . 
   can we also ban any symbols of capitalism please ? 
  what ? 
  like ... factories ? 
  cars ? 
  top hats ? 
  cigars ? 
  capitalism never really made particular symbols , afaik ( or perhaps i do n't recognize them ) whereas communism did . 
  for capitalism certain things associated with capitalists/capitalist societies/wealth became symbols . 
  though this may sound , no doubt , peevish i 'm actually wondering what symbols of capitalism you mean . 
   also if we 're banning things based on them representing mass-murderers , can we also ban anything which symbolises the united states ? 
  not sure most western nations could get away with that without some redfaced embarrasment . 
  buuurhh, 
  usually one does n't wear a tunic next to the body either , but on it . 
  and i have no idea what ` canvus ' would be and how it differs from ` canvas ' . 
  interesting . 
  the 1066 one does n't seem to be there though . 
  it is [ here ] ( https://imgur.com/gallery/g6wf47v ) , along with some of the others . 
  should n't be hard , i 'm on ` broil slightly ' . 
  of course , googling that got a rather different ` marrons ' as well . 
  edit ; i clearly misremembered . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ flemish ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ frankish, 
  and here 's where you became a twat . 
  huh . 
  what , i thought mensur was old stuff . 
  which two guns are aaron and moses ? 
  i see four and two empty placements . 
  that 's a fortress alright . 
  no redoubt about it . 
  my hero, 
  i knew it was gon na be about hnaflbaflwhiflsnifltafl !, 
  i also just read there 's android versions for it , must try . 
  you 're right . 
  i 'd just woken up and had it a bit wonky . 
  communism itself is like diametrically opposed to abolition of state . 
  baffled at slow post , i expect . 
  yeah . 
  and at first i missed the billion so it seemed believeble . 
  just ` euh , hey look at that ' . 
  as if it had gotten lost in mist of bureaucracy . 
  despite what the dutch often seem to claim ( half-serious ) , separation is n't a popular thing in our bit either . 
  :p mind you , yellow is n't a very often used colour in the frisian flags ( except i think north frisia , which goes yellow-red-blue ) , so westerlauwersk could make more or less the same objection . 
  yeah , i just read about it ( on fy . 
  wiki ) turns out there was a lot of criticism about it . 
  from east-frisia especially because your colours were n't in it . 
  maybe the unofficial ynterfryske flag could be a nice addition . 
  as well as other frisian flags . 
  that 's true as far as i know . 
  unless plain ol' ambushing counts :p the sharpe tv-series ( and i assume the bookseries , but i 've only read two or so ) has the british forces working * with * guerilla . 
  and also against villainous guerilla . 
  but the guerilla tend to be spaniards . 
  frisians object : we drink coffee . 
  especially this frisian , and looking at my name i 'm clearly the frisianest :3, 
  did n't the spanish kind of do the whole guerilla thing ? 
  see the name , for instance ? 
  i 'm not saying britain was n't involved , but eh . 
  always seemed a spot odd to say two groups celts never met one another . 
  ` course they did . 
  they grew from the same stem, 
  it 's not a * cum spoon . 
  exactly . 
  first thought was ' i used to live near there ' but then realized it was off . 
  could be * anywhere * . 
  dude clearly lives on mars or something, 
  certainly does, 
  and do that for 35 years erry day, 
  ` vocal ' or ` radical ' is not necessarily islamic terrorist . 
  the great big picture in the article does also have brown eyes though, 
  seems a typo . 
  are n't brown eyes the most common eyes ? 
  ^ ^ ^ everyone ^ ^ ^ has ^ ^ ^ one . 
  depends what you call a person , but yeah i guess . 
  let 's start a war . 
  start a nuclear war, 
  alternative ; the corners white with a wee pompebl\u00ead in each :3, 
  kill 'em with kindness ? 
  clever . 
  they should vistula the helmets instead . 
  well , you 're wrong . 
  man , i thought this would be the offical response . 
  but it 's him and his silly hat again . 
  i read ` hammer first ' because i see the french flag and assume it was a reference to karel martel ( e sort of \u00e8 for dutch , in this case ) ; saviour of western europe ( yadayada , he fought a raid of arabs into southern france ) , grandpap\u00e8re to karel the grote ( ` charlemagne ' is a silly word to use in english ) and violent oppressor of the proud frisian people ; __ ;, 
  etymologically , does n't that mean he was n't genocidal ? 
  just ... really really cidal . 
  not too sure they had genuine lobbies then , but interesting . 
  probably a good idea too to make sure bakers and brewers do n't combine . 
  economic policy ? 
  i thought it had been meant to make sure some hygiene and quality requirements were met . 
  like a reverse d\u00e9pardieu, 
  i was so thinking of a little dig at greece , then resolved to just make it a dig at whichever country it turned out to be from . 
  and then it was dutch . 
  yeah . 
  those got shoved eastwards later . 
  to the north too . 
  just pickle his dickle . 
  not even necessarily eu4 just paradox grand strategy in general,
