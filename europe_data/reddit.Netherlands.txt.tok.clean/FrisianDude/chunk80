  guy with a moustache , does n't know how the internet works , apparently cool . 
  likes meat . 
  alas , poor hobsbawm . 
  wow , no wonder cia removed that page . 
  oh that is so lovely . 
  tears to the eyes lovely , that shit is beautiful . 
  of course !, 
  i forgot about the border checks , my bad . 
  the netherlands , eh . 
  :p or thinking of dutroux ( via woods - ardennes ) or ~ ~ schnitzl ~ ~ fritzl a basement would be quite enough . 
  it 'd make more sense for them to skip the eu altogether/hide in woodsy parts ( not necessarily outside own country . ), 
  iirc that does n't always work , though . 
  then again , maybe it does . 
  chicken is chicken in both instances , right ? 
  it does n't turn into poulet . 
   caused by the unrest due to the thirty years war against france , well that 's slightly oversimplified . 
  there 's always someone claiming to be constantly bashed . 
  `` keuninge '' ( kings ) is pretty much the same in frisian . 
  :p but the actual linguistic branch english belongs to is anglo-frisian , subset of west-germanic , subset of germanic , so in terms of origin frisian is certainly closer to english than french is . 
  the normans make the distinction far less obvious , of course . 
  i 'd easily argue many ` upper class ' terms would be more close to french , whereas many lower class are more related to frisian and to some extent german and dutch . 
  mind you , i am merely interested in linguistics rather than an expert , but there are some great cognates . 
  schule-school-school-skoalle vs ecole ( spelling ? 
  ) , for example , though both * school * and * ecole * are the same root again . 
  * church * is better perhaps ; kirche-kerk-church-tsjerke vs eglise . 
  then again , * pork * and * beef * are * porc * and * bouef * . 
  though * pig * and * cow * are closer to * big * ( piglet , actually ) and * koe * than to * cochon * and * vache * . 
  though * big * , an adult one is * varken * , and * koe * are dutch rather than frisian which calls them * baarch * ( cognate is boar ) and * ko * . 
  is not !, 
   if a child is abducted in the eu , the logical step is to move to another eu state if possible . 
  i do n't quite get what you mean here . 
  : o it seems to me as if you 're saying i should move to germany if a child in the netherlands is abducted , but that seems pointless and unlikely what you meant , so you probably meant someone who abducts a child then flees to the next eu state ? 
  they lost algeria , they just kept the algerians . 
  they lost algeria . 
  dang , that sucks . 
  is it possible to rename the village ? 
  i do visit / r/islam sometimes . 
  they 're almost all condemning extremism . 
  yes it is , because if you 're out burning camps you ca n't prevent anyone from nicking your tv from your home . 
  i 'm mostly surprised at the low numbers for lebanon here . 
  you really believe that ? 
  of course most muslims condemn idiotic acts as it only makes them look bad . 
  i really really doubt a significant number go `` secretly i am glad that this person blew themself up in order to spatter gooey chunks all over the western infidel '' and anyone i 've seen argue to ban blasphemy did it not just because it might be against one certain religion . 
  and that is why burning down camps is pointless . 
  it does seem really hopeless , that situation . 
  well , yes . 
  and most do believe that , surely ? 
   where the government is n't supposed to prefer one religion over the other . 
  but they do . 
  erdogan is quite stridently muslim , and you ca n't not be christian or sort-of-christian if you want to be us prez . 
  :p edit ; reassessing ; that 's probably not what you meant . 
  tbh , acupuncture is one of the few ` alternatives ' i can see working . 
  not in the sense of needle up the buttocks cures eyepains , but some relief of pressure might be brought . 
  as others have said ; the map is certainly not complete . 
  but credit where credit is due ; i love what they did with their heraldry . 
  edit ; also , the amount of danish breweries surprised me . 
  best answer possible . 
  maybe it should be . 
  and with tournaments . 
  the best player gets to decide eu policy . 
  err , i get what you 're saying , but burgundy was a county , and there were no ` german ' nor ` italian ' unified nation-states , much less kings thereof . 
  you 're right on bohemia though , bohemia had a king who was also elector to the hre . 
  exactly . 
   while your politeness system is admirable and should be the solution to this problem we should n't forget that the smokers had centuries to be polite and simply prefered to ignore the non-smokers . 
  really ? 
  smokers get to live for centuries ? 
  awesome . 
  i 'd rather belong with a merkelreich than in the anglosphere . 
  god is big and he said `` bang , let there be light . '', 
  and lo there was light . 
  this is why people now often bang in the dark , in honour of the first lightless bang . 
   edit : if , of course , you were born after 1983 . 
  he said he 's 21 . 
  so he is . 
  i hope they wo n't switch over to it ; seems rather expensive . 
  more like `` i broke shit , my bad , hey everyone is using my retouched image for humour , give me money . '', 
  i misphrased , i meant `` is popular mainly in the ( middle ) - east . '', 
  yes , islam is popular in the ( middle-east ) but , no , that does n't mean it 's an eastern religion . 
   [ the term western religion refers to religions that originated within western culture , and are thus which historically , culturally , and theologically distinct from the eastern religions . 
  the contrast between western and eastern religions largely pertains to the distinction between monotheism and polytheism , respectively , and the term abrahamic religion is often used in lieu of using the east and west terminology . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_religion ), 
  but i wo n't promise to like it . 
  islam is a western religion in the sense that abrahamic religions ( as opposed to dharmic ) are referred to as western . 
  my main concern is that people are using ` quota ' to refer to the singular . 
  noooo . 
  agreed , though dislike of roma seems very , very common outside of / r/europe as well . 
  looks like the ottoman empire + vastly simplified balkan region . 
  as interesting as discussing this is , i 'm not going to read something calling itself ` truthdig ' . 
  there is just no way that that site is n't filled with wacky-for-the-sake-wacky , tinfoil hats , etc. 
  ( also , i ment law when i typed man . 
  oops . 
  utopia , as more wrote it , seems pretty shitty to me , tbh . 
  :p you simply can not be atheist there without everyone else seeing it as their duty to get you to acknowledge the existence of souls and other hokum . 
  err , i personally am somewhat socialist and i do n't see how my thought about anarchy can be seen as a thought about socialism . 
  you said that  but continually developing and continually re-adjusted in accordance with the ever-growing requirements of a free life stimulated by the progress of science , invention , and the steady growth of higher ideals '' and what i meant was that i thought that this is likely to mean that every day people have to argue their boundaries/wishes/plans ad nauseam . 
  and to be quite honest , i think it 's a bit childish to assert that people now live ` petrified ' by law , routine and superstition . 
  the one most likely to be petrified of is that one which changes most often ; law . 
  in a democratic nation law does change . 
  it changes slowly , and i think that the change of law should be slow . 
  routine might be the hardest one to duck out of , especially if the position of the employee/student/anything else is rigidly defined .
