  : o is this common at all ? 
  very strange . 
  ( side note ; personally i think it 's too bad that one guy is called ` enrique . ', 
  `` hendrik en hugo '' sound like a better combination , but then i 'm just fond of alliteration . ), 
  that actually makes it slightly better . 
  in which case it still seems mighty peevish to actually bother contacting the police for being called a butthole . 
  was the victim elderly as wellderly ? 
  the lying i can understand levying heavy fines on . 
  on the insult not so much . 
  i have to say i do n't really consider it a right to be safe from insults . 
  if only because insults tend to do very little harm , indeed none at all , unless they are heaved at you constantly . 
  a single off-hand remark of ` arschloch ' should be repaid with ` fick dich ' or whatever , not with big wads of money , imo . 
  outside of the netherlands as well . 
  officially eu-recognized and all . 
  it is a language . 
  i do !, 
  i speak [ bildts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bildts ) at home ( rather than ` real ' frisian or dutch . ), 
  which limburgisch ? 
  does n't every town have a different version , sort of ? 
  look around in that factbook i linked in the previous post , might take some worry off your mind when you see that the numbers of muslims are actually quite low in western countries . 
  you did mention you do n't care about those numbers , but without numbers no-one simply can take over ` our way of life ' . 
  he 's saying that if 3 % manage to somehow take control over the other 97 % then clearly they 're good at what they do . 
  also , txampion is a fucking moron . 
  imo , the media concentrates too much on the failures in integration ; i dare say by far most do integrate well enough , and though some cloister themselves off ( quite possibly mainly due to negative attitudes towards their religion ) and in cloistering become more fundamental , most children and descendants thereof of immigrants are less religious than their parents . 
  - however , the only way to allow better integration is by actually allowing those immigrants to integrate . 
  if the society they move to attack everything they hold dear like idiots like wilders do , what incentive is there for them to join a society that decided from the start that those immigrants are evildoers with  a poisonous ideology that threatens my culture and way of life . 
  even though all immigrants want is to live without the constant threat of exploding/being murdered by talibastards . 
  hostility always breeds hostility . 
  - that said , there certainly is a tendency to fundamentalism in the - often shitty - countries said immigrants left . 
  sometimes that is why those migrants left . 
  i do n't think that the religion itself is more fundamentalist than most christian groups are . 
  ( indeed the most important difference seems to be the number of prophets . ), 
  exactly , they wanted their own domains/nations to expand . 
  in doing so charlemagne may have helped kickstart ` western civilization ' , but it was never his goal at all in the least to unite anything . 
  precisely !, 
  got ta have sugar . 
  well , okay , but owning a dick is enjoyable as well . 
  and holding it . 
  and swinging it . 
  and helicoptering it . 
  do n't need to suck it to enjoy it ; it 's not a lollipop . 
  i see . 
  i 'd only noticed this in / r/wtf earlier . 
  the title says when , not to . 
  first thought ;  many leaders have tried to unite europe -- attila , charlemagne , napoleon , and hitler among others oh come on . 
  as if their goals were ever ` to unite europe ' . 
  attila and charles hardly even thought of europe as a single entity with multiple nations . 
  now i 'll read the rest . 
  edit , actually , no i wo n't . 
  this made me feel sad for everyone involved . 
  i saw it mentioned in / r/wtf that the woman was eighty and homeless ( !! ), 
  and tried to help . 
  actually , your [ here ] is just a [ here ] , not a link . 
  oh , he did use music as just an example ; i 'd think the entire ambience 'd be slightly adapted for ladies night . 
  no , it is n't . 
  it 's not even threatening . 
  i mean , just look at the [ cia world factbook . 
  ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nl.html ) entry for the netherlands :  ethnic groups : field info displayed for all countries in alpha order . 
  dutch 80.7 % , eu 5 % , ** indonesian 2.4 % , turkish 2.2 % , surinamese 2 % , moroccan 2 % ** , caribbean 0.8 % , other 4.8 % ( 2008 est. ), 
   religions : field info displayed for all countries in alpha order . 
  roman catholic 30 % , protestant 20 % ( dutch reformed 11 % , calvinist 6 % , other protestant 3 % ) , ** muslim 5.8 % ** , other 2.2 % , none 42 % ( 2006 ) oh noooooooo . 
  granted , i would n't mind an update but more because a more current year is more likely to still be accurate ( therefore , useful in argument ) than because i think it 's grown so very much . 
  - then again , you are probably trolling , spoofing those who tout `` judeo-christian '' bullshit . 
  but does not everyone enjoy dick ? 
  like he said . 
  by changing  belg belgium to  belg fritkotten , zenne . 
  or similar . 
  nope , seems entirely accurate . 
  many ladies ' nights are specifically that ladies get in cheaper , sure , but what alexanderpas said is also possible . 
  i see little reason to take regressionists seriously . 
  daaamn , lucky son of a gun . 
  yes , but i do n't see how that makes it surprising that there 's been war in their history . 
  :p even sealand has history of war . 
  what 's surprising about that ? 
   one of the arguments you may hear in favour of it is that they bring in tourism money . 
  i do n't believe there would be any less without them - after all , france gets more . 
  this is n't an argument . 
  france gets more because of vinery traditions , because of chateaux , because of paris ' reputation , because of good beaches , because of the weather . 
  they do n't get more tourism because they have an elected head of state rather than an inherited one . 
   we 've been quite lucky with the danish monarchy , our queen is well liked and quite suited to the job . 
  the crown prince is harder to imagine as king , same with the dutch , really . 
  to restructure ; judaism does not equal zionism . 
  way you phrased it means that judaism is synonymous to not being zionism . 
  hah , lovely . 
   we 're in shit , how do we get out of it ? 
  lie . 
  [ that 's why i fear ikea !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oa5t0-e9um ), 
  via spray or just chuck it down in cans ? 
  pardon me for not knowing everything of a country thousands of kilometers away . 
  hm , i was more thinking that indeed it was caused by poverty , it also makes it harder to combat that very poverty . 
  so while indeed not the root , you 're right , it does propagate a shitty situation , right ? 
  interesting , never heard of that . 
  i was under the impression those organized crime groups were southern-grown like most of their other problems . 
  that seems so apt . 
  the idea about brits in my head is that they ca n't decide whether they want to be with europe or not . 
   edit2 : just though of it , the union jack was quite popular ( as in i noticed it a lot ) as a symbol to put on clothing etc , do you like it or something ? 
  so is the stars & stripes . 
  both look like shit on clothing , imo , but i suppose people just like the clash of colours without seeming too nationalist ( elsewise the dutch flag would be just as great . ), 
  and perhaps a little bit of `` we love everything anglophone '' as well for some reason .
