  you can vote in any voting station within your municipality , except for when you apply for a pass to vote in another municipality . 
  it seems like that 's not a thing over here . 
  first exit poll traditionally comes when the voting 's closed, 
  [ dionne ] ( http://s.numrush.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/dionne-stax.jpg ) is a lovely replacement, 
  third or fourth is very realistic, 
  i think ( and hope ) that gl wo n't go in a coalition just with these three parties . 
  in four years they will suffer in a similar way as the pvda does right now . 
  the animal party has had a great influence on our politics in 10 years , all achieved with a few seats . 
  that we get the elderly party and very conservative christians as well is something we should accept . 
  you 're implying that the situation will stay too dangerous in syria for a whole more decade and that the refugees will keep coming in millions . 
  i do n't think so . 
  some of our christian parties are indeed non-secular and everyone says so . 
  the other 16 % might vote for them as a protest vote, 
  that 's probably true , but i do n't think that would be a good development . 
  that 's indeed part of the problem , but sadly a large part of our country just does n't like eastern europeans . 
   some i 'd guess * most *, 
  we 're reaching peak democracy . 
  i do n't think pvda will want to be in government after the huge loss they will suffer . 
  depending on which party will become biggest it will be either cu or gl or both that will form a coalition with vvd-cda-d66, 
  you do n't get a seat if you do n't get enough votes for 1 seat , a * lijstverbinding * ca n't do anything about that . 
  so you could say we have a 0,67 % threshold . 
  no normal threshold stops 8 parties from getting over 5 % and below 20 %, 
  \u00cd know what the outcome would be if a referendum was held . 
  our word is without - fe ?!, 
  i 've been doing this wrong my whole life, 
  well , because you only vote for a few seats in a 750 seats parliament , you ca n't change much indeed . 
  but every vote still counts . 
  wow , slovakia only has 13 % , how can you care that little ? 
  we have a party literally named ` libertarian party ' , they are n't even close to a seat in parliament . 
  i think dutch people cherish at least a part of the welfare state too much to vote for libertarians . 
  you should add to this that his main voter base is enterpreneurs and upper ( middle ) class people , who mostly only care about their wallet . 
  this gives him a very stable foundation , especially since cda lost a lot of voters 7 years ago . 
  no main party in our election comes close to libertarianism , maybe only vnl . 
  i thought rtl 's carr\u00e9debat was this weekend ? 
  not only the visegrad . 
  the nordic countries and my country are opposed to a lot of further integration as well . 
  i 've never heard of it and i consider myself as an eu-aware citizen . 
  if there has been a public debate on eppo i 've missed it completely . 
  well , of course it does n't really look like this if you 're standing were he 's standing . 
  i made a similar picture and it looked like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/27aqy ) . 
  if you zoom in you can get a similar frame as the picture that is posted . 
  i do n't know how often the sky is clear enough to get a really impressive view of the mountains . 
  that 's why you say `` american here '' at the start of every second post . 
  but does it mean that from that language group irish is closest to portugese ? 
  same for dutch and greek , why is greek not connected to german or any other language within the germanic group ? 
   great 60s-70s music scene still a great music scene , especially in the 90s and 00s . 
  there is no threshold . 
  you just have to get enough votes for one seat , which is 0,67 %, 
  the images people have about their role in ( ex - ) colonies is largely shaped by domestic media , so it should n't be a surprise that they think it 's way more positive than it actually is . 
  xenophobia is also a phobia . 
  you asked everyone who is affraid to fly why they are ? 
  ** germany ** most thrustworthy : germany most compassionate : germany least arrogant : germany this does n't add up, 
  maybe he thinks trump does n't need to be demeaned ? 
  to a lot of people he already a bad candidate as being himself . 
  it 's still doable, 
  this tweet does n't mean he supports trump . 
   this idea of what is german or what is french , etc. 
  is something that was partly fabricated by our respective ruling classes to convince us to die for their personal enrichment . 
  wow thanks , i never thought about it this way , but it 's a very strong thought . 
  but not all of those moroccans , turks , indonesians and surinams were born abroad , i 'd even say most of them were n't . 
  not sure about germans though . 
  those combinations of u 's i 's and j 's look perfectly normal to me . 
  more and more people use bike sharing schemes where they can just take a bike at the train station and cycle to their destination, 
  i absolutely loved tuscany when i was there in 2009 , definitely planning to go back . 
   he 'll need at least 2 other parties to form a coalition probably true , but there is a scenario possible where there will be a two-man 's race between vvd and pvv . 
  they could reach 76 together , suddenly decide that the differences are n't that big and form a coalition . 
  very unlikely , but not impossible to be honest . 
  that 2 % is way too high . 
  it 's just not necessary if you cooperate , i think 1 % of eu gdp already is enough . 
  i think he means that you could afford it without bad consequences . 
  that the message would come across . 
  you know nothing about correlation if you think that one or a few countries in the good education & bad democracy already disproves his point . 
  i used to religiously watch eurosport . 
  ski jumping , biatlon , alpine skiing , you name it , i 've watched it . 
  he is very recognisable and the commentators always said he was a hero in poland . 
  but speed skating will always be a superior sport , 
  le pen does not represent an entire country and is probably not going to win the next election either . 
  blaming everything on one side also leads to pretending people who made mistakes did nothing wrong . 
  maybe economically it is n't that much of a difference . 
  but the strongest powers in the world steer the common values and goals of humanity , i would much rather have those determined by france and germany . 
  krakow is a great city , loved the wawel castle , the central square and the schindler factory museum . 
  used to be more to the east and in a partnership with lithuania . 
  they get a lot of euromonies . 
  yes , we 're at kettles now, 
  triggered, 
  i had my semester abroad in newcastle when gbpeur peaked at around 1.40 , i was so poor over there . 
  there were some margharita 's for $ 17 or something i guess . 
  i was in bern last summer and i was really shocked . 
  impossible to get a pizza for under $ 15 . 
  switzerland is such a beautiful country , but an impossible holiday destination for a lot of people . 
  but is 2 % really still necessary ? 
  especially with more cooperation between countries and the massive advantage in gdp compared to potential agressors i think 1 % enforced minimum already is enough . 
  i believe that soft power works most of the time and ramping up defence spending only sparks feelings of hostility . 
  but maybe that 's just pacifist me . 
  they are n't dissolving the eu are they ? 
  what if you subtract payments from the budget ** to ** the uk from that number ? 
  the problem is not that ` the eu does not listen ' . 
  the eu is still mostly a group of member states . 
  there are many good proposals as you said , but there is always a few countries opposing those . 
  decision making is hampered by the power that only 1 member can have on the outcome .
