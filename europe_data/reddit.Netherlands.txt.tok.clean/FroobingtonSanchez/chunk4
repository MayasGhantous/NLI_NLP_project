   he led the party into another grand coalition . 
  but it would be seen as good if schulz did the same ? 
   if an mp carries on ignoring the whip they 'll likely find themselves forever a backbencher and/or losing their candidacy at the next election in the netherlands this is usually the moment where they start a new party . 
  i get that this is not a viable option with a fptp system . 
  maybe he does n't want to scare away the part of the electorate that he 's losing to ukip and voted for brexit . 
  he might think he has little to win with opposing the invocation of article 50 , because it will pass anyway and it shows that he respects the decision of the people . 
  namibia and botswana are not the best examples . 
  their fertility rates are slightly above european level now . 
  the economy changes a lot quicker nowadays . 
  it was quick , but not that quick iirc, 
  who 's the turkish guy ? 
  cool to have a non-footballer as national idol . 
  technically juncker is also a president, 
  but a slight increase or decrease in percentage already makes a big difference . 
  on top of that : lower than 40 or higher than 80 hardly happens anywhere . 
  depends on what you want to compare . 
  this discussion was about size of funding space agencies . 
  if europe 's funding is bigger , it 's bigger . 
  if you want to put it relative to gdp , you may , but that was not the point . 
  it also has huge areas where living or farming is not sustainable, 
  if we would convert the us and european space programs into rubles it would look exactly the same . 
  definitely suez canal , the pacific is huuuge . 
   sea trade routes are under usa control ships have to pass the us to go from china to europe ? 
  you ca n't control sea trade if ships do n't go through your territorial waters . 
  there are pretty succesful muslim politicians in the netherlands . 
  the mayor of our 2nd biggest city rotterdam , some mps and the chairwoman of the parliament are all muslim and most of them are not disliked . 
  it adds legitimacy to their claim . 
  i can see him quitting wto, 
  damn, 
   no shit , if the german , french and dutch elections go wrong , we wo n't even have a eu at the end of the year . 
  that 's what i meant , but some people pretend that europe would be better off without it . 
  comments like these make clear that global powers like the us and russia are eagerly waiting for this to happen . 
  if it happens it means we are divided and divided you are weak . 
   that said , i think only the dutch are at risk of actually electing a demagogue . 
  pvv might become the biggest party , but it will be very hard for wilders to form a government . 
  i 'm not extremely worried about us . 
  i never heard him criticising it , although that does n't mean that much . 
  he obviously loves trump , but he already stated that he expects the us to be a solid nato partner under trump , which now seems unlikely . 
  he also said that their views and the us 's and dutch national interests can be different . 
  i think the us has as much too lose from less trade with the whole eu as is the case the other way around . 
  an eu - china coalition would be even riskier for trump . 
  if the french , dutch and german elections turn out badly we might be in some very big trouble . 
  but if trump goes through with this a lot of countries will realise how important european cooperation is , so it could turn out pretty good as well . 
  i saw that , i just went to wikipedia to see what eu institutions there are . 
  luxembourg wo n't be happy with that , but they ca n't complain with that much money and their status as tax haven . 
  another idea as someone in this thread pointed out , would be to move the ema and/or eba from london to strasbourg . 
  but everything is also crazy expensive there . 
  they must be having a fucking blast while on holiday though . 
  is ireland also that expensive ? 
  i did n't expect them to be this high . 
  which ones ? 
  why do n't they base one of the other eu institutions in strasbourg permanently ? 
  like the european court of auditors or something . 
  long term forecasts also predict cold weather next week , so we might finally see some real snow and ice again . 
  soon . . 
  that 's the whole idea right ? 
  it is strongly encouraged to join , but opt-outs are possible if you make a strong case . 
  just like the euro and schengen . 
  nato relies on the same expectations . 
  it 's just a slightly different group of countries . 
  that 's a bit harsh for a city founded by greeks more than 2000 years ago . 
  that must be billions going down that drain , such an extremely common situation . 
  they are our germanic brothers , as long as they learn dutch i 'm fine with it . 
  we 'd have more than double our area and population , i 'd say good deal . 
  imagine being evacuated on christmas day , who comes up with that ? 
  how did you get there ? 
  did you take the hogwarts express ? 
  how is their university system not a mess if a lot of americans ca n't pay tuition fees ? 
  yay , southern recognition . 
  people , our language does n't always sound like someone is choking !, 
  who will have a white christmas ? 
  it 's going to be 5 to 10 \u00b0 c here again :(, 
  is it maybe because a lot of people in luxemburg work for eu-related institutions , making the net contribution smaller . 
  wow cool , i never saw this . 
  in which period was that ? 
  great !, 
  i had the first two and a birthday in early january . 
  it was a winter jackpott every year . 
  ah , because other things were wrong with the us elections , russia could n't have played a role in this . 
   ~ ~ dat ~ ~ stat oil ftfy, 
  i got mine too !, 
  did n't answer question 51, 
  so ... catvia ? 
  the numbers you are referring to are terrifying , but they assume that there wo n't be a ** major ** food/water crisis before 2100 . 
  no way africa is able to feed more than double the population it has now . 
  i also think that birth rates will fall faster than predicted , just for the sake of necessity . 
  awareness about the problem at hand has grown so quickly in the last 20 years , that the next 85 will surely spark a huge turn-around in the mentality of people on that continent . 
  they ca n't ignore it . 
  helmond is not that bad, 
  when i went to prague and looked over the city from the castle 's side we thought it was a rocket launch platform or some alien thing . 
  such a weird thing to see in the distance . 
  it 's enormous as well . 
  you 're right , but that was a pretty complete other situation . 
  she was not murdered , had been able to live a long and peaceful lives and most importantly : personally ruined the lives of a lot of people with her actions . 
  i 'm not saying you should celebrate any death , but i can understand them a lot better . 
  what did jo cox ever do to those people ? 
  but ethno-fascists are already radicalized , what do they become when they radicalize * more * ? 
  that would make a great show . 
  a sports channel would definitely help , especially for showing european competitions like uefa europa league ( champions league would be way too expensive ) , european championships in all kinds of sports etc.
