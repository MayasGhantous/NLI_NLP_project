  i think it should be more meat , less other things . 
  but i eat my pasta with tomato sauce and minced meat with paprika and mushrooms and still call it bolognese . 
  suck it , italy, 
  this research group bases its method on the fact that advanced producer services ( mostly financial ) makes the ` globalness ' of a city . 
  they 're connected to the world economy through having hqs or at least important offices of those companies . 
  i think it 's outdated since it has taken off massively in the last 15 years , but they 're still highly regarded in this type of research . 
  most surprising was monaco for me . 
  imagine having a lower peak than a micro state next to the sea . 
  my physics teacher once explained why it almost always feels like you have headwind . 
  tailwind only works when it 's within x degrees right behind you . 
  because you move forward , the wind must have at least the same velocity in the direction that you 're heading , if it does n't it does n't feel as tailwind . 
  but even when the wind comes from the side , it will feel as a headwind , because , again , you 're moving forward and the difference between your own velocity and the wind ( in the same direction ) is negative . 
  so you have ` headwind ' more often than tailwind . 
  just calling polders and dikes ' a flat landscape ' is not paying it justice . 
  it 's a whole different kind of landscape than flat landscapes elsewhere, 
  when i was in venice with my parents basically the only thing i saw was the park and the biennale ... 
  i need to go back some day . 
  people love cities more and more . 
  certainly does n't look like that trend will be reversed very soon . 
  yeah , same for italy . 
  just something we 're not used to at all . 
  a single market is more than that, 
  it 's my dream too , but at least you get that most of the year , for us it 's only possible in the summer and incidentally in april , may and october, 
  let 's make europe day a public holiday !, 
  there are only positives , most people love free days and if the whole of europe has a free day at the same time it really helps bonding . 
  or you do two rounds , so the people that voted for the ` wrong ' choice would have a say in the details too, 
  you did n't confuse them . 
  buma was all for restricting freedom of speech and even locking people up before they can commit a terror attack . 
  this is glorious, 
  or : `` the country formerly known as the former yugoslav republic of macedonia '', 
  not top priority , but our coalition system as it is works fine . 
  there is no reason that every party should be represented in a government , parties that are n't in it can propose laws too and they are often enough accepted too . 
  too bad the world is not ready for it , it would be a better place with coalitions everywhere, 
  that 's basically the same as no government . 
  it would mean making a new coalition for every proposed law . 
  that would be very inefficient, 
  hmm i see . 
  i guess that you want a single ruling party with a presidential system , but for parliamentary democracies proportional really should work best . 
  i do n't mind coalitions at all actually , i think it creates really balanced policies and a constant move forward . 
  i find it really funny that everyone panics if a government is not formed immediately . 
  i 'm not worried at all after three months . 
  russia loves having more land , estonia has a substantial russian minority . 
  if they feel that europe / nato is divided or weak they might try something . 
  maybe it would be better than if people could give 3 votes to one party , 2 votes to a second party and 1 vote to a third party . 
  that way it can be proportional and it would favor the parties in the middle . 
  do n't worry , most dutch people have 3 to 5 gb nowadays . 
  it 's changing though , unlimited is quickly approaching normal prices, 
  this was really good !, 
  i 'm so happy that france seems to have a convincing and strong leader again . 
  europe will need that in the coming years to be a global force, 
  iceland has no pornhub ? 
  does n't watch porn ? 
  has no females ? 
  has sunk into the atlantic ocean ? 
  so many questions, 
  was that the actual reason ? 
  the eu did n't ignore our referendum result though , our government did . 
  it 's not foreign , we are the eu, 
  they 're not getting a member of the eu . 
  besides , behind ukraine there 's only russia , who 's already at our doorstep . 
  a more stable and wealthy partner at our doorstep . 
  maybe not more motive to do it , but certainly less reasons ** not ** to do it, 
  just testing how good my portugese reading skill is ( thought it was not existing ) . 
  does this say : ' i ca n't think of a name more portugese ? ', 
  i think it would be great if our european entertainment industry would get the attention it deserves . 
  i 'm sure we have the same creative qualities as the american entertainment industry , but due to non-english languages and smaller budgets it is very hard to compete . 
  if we let the market do its job , it 's possible that soon almost nothing is left . 
  i appreciate this move . 
  you could 've used the uk and i 'd almost agree with you , but i have n't noticed erdogan-like rhetorics against germany, 
  but we would n't use such rhetorics against a country we 're allied with . 
  it 's a missed opportunity . 
  our green party combines ` labour ' and ` libdems ' policies with a green sauce and it brought them a lot of votes this year . 
  but we have such a fractured political landscape that there is both a more left and a more pro-environment party than the greens :d, 
  in the netherlands you ** have ** to change your permanent address if you 're living on your own close to uni . 
  so those statistics must be right , unless there are people sleeping at friends/family during the week . 
  but i think that 's an exception . 
  what about the greens ? 
  are they a ` normal ' party in the uk or too radical ? 
  does labour qualify as a progressive party ? 
  you automatically learn to work together with other parties to get shit done . 
  that results in more balanced policies and that they are not being turned around completely after 5 years . 
  i lived in newcastle for 5 months and i did n't expect that cycling would be * that * dangerous over there . 
  almost no cycling lanes , cars not noticing you or doing weird stuff because they were confused by me . 
  all the other people that * did * cycle were wearing helmets and visibility vests , but i did n't want to look stupid . 
  for us it did matter . 
  when you failed you had to do it again the next year . 
  plus they are much more likely to be outside on the street , for multiple reasons . 
  new elections could turn out good too . 
  with less people voting for parties that would n't make a coalition anyway like fvd , denk and pvv . 
  maybe even more people would vote green / progressive after the big call for sustainability during the last few months and the victory for macron . 
  we had a similar scattered political field in the mid ' 00s though , when they were still the biggest party by far . 
  the vvd took their role . 
  sieneke and de toppers ( there was n't anyone in between right ? ), 
  were the absolute lowest we could sink , glad that 's over . 
  true . 
  one thing 's for sure : it 's always a great spectacle, 
  a large part of the public sees it like that in the netherlands , but there are countries that take it really seriously . 
  and most of the artists do too i reckon . 
  hey , austria was the original combo breaker ( and us after that ), 
  can it get more ironic ?
