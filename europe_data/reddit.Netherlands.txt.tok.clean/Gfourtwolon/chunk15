  * that does not apply to the srebrenica situation at fucking all * . 
   unless your country scorns heroes that die defending civilians . 
  they would n't have been defended ; they would 've died . 
   you do n't know what a no-win situation is unless you fight . 
  have you seen what they were up against ? 
   but history proves you wrong there . 
  history does n't prove anything . 
  all the battles this has been compared to were exceptions to the rule , which is why they 're such prominent examples . 
  thing is ; you never hear the losing side where a last stand situation * was * unwinnable . 
   i was talking about the dutch state . 
  which has been tried with the result in the article . 
  i do n't see the issue ? 
   if the netherlands does n't think it belongs in peacekeeping operations of `` second world countrys '' cause that 's below them the government thinks we should be there ; the underequipped and undersupplied soldiers stationed there not so much . 
   do n't follow the damn alliance . 
  what alliance ? 
  the un ? 
  this was n't a nato mission and the un is n't an alliance . 
  the characters are similar or the same ( simplified vs traditional ) , but the pronunciation is * completely * different . 
   and it was those soldiers ' duty to protect them , not hand them over . 
  regardless of the responsibility that also burdens the higher-ups , these soldiers fucked up too . 
  they would 've been scorned even if they died . 
  it was a no-win situation , best they could do is survive and get some hostages freed . 
   ause they 're not citizens of as an illustrious country as yous and throwing grenades at soldiers . 
  how strange soldiers do n't want to defend you if you throw grenades at them . 
   you should n't be in this war in the first place agreed . 
   you deserve to get trialed . 
  why ? 
  those soldiers did n't decide to station themselves there . 
  the article states that the dutch * state * is responsible , not the soldiers . 
  please do explain to me how dying in this specific situation would 've been helpful in * any * way ? 
  you can use cool metaphors all you like , but none of them apply to the srebrenica situation . 
  \u7537 means `` man '' or `` male '' and \u5973 means `` woman '' or `` female '' . 
  \u4eba means `` person '' or `` human '' . 
  ca n't help you with pronunciation , though . 
  thing is ; srebrenica had no other defences or anything that could 've been set up if the enemy advance had been slowed down . 
  it was an enclave within a country that wanted those bosniaks dead . 
   also , that last bit is exactly why i 'd never want the uk in an eu army . 
  troops on the ground do n't get to make the ` these civilians are n't worth fighting for because of their nationality ' decision . 
  there 's a difference between defending an allied nation and defending an imploding second world country 's citizens with those citizens throwing grenades at you and while receiving no supplies or air support . 
  they . 
  would . 
  not . 
  been . 
  able . 
  defend . 
   death in the defence of civillians , in the line of duty is n't needless . 
  they would n't be able to defend them ; it would just add to the death toll . 
  it 's great sitting behind a keyboard or typing on your phone that `` these men should 've died '' , but at least be realistic . 
  these men were undersupplied , undermanned , and denied the support they requested . 
  i would n't have defended it with my life either if my allies decided to not act as allies should , or if the ones i 'm supposed to protect are now lobbing grenades at me . 
   the point is , if you 're told to hold your position , you hold your fucking position , because that 's your job . 
  that 's a fun anecdote . 
  also shows that following those orders was completely useless and only gained a general or politician i could n't give a fuck about some bonus points in the media . 
   a proper army knows that . 
  un peacekeeping force = / = a proper army . 
  i fully understand why dutch soldiers would n't give their lives for some shithole in the balkans . 
  they 're always fighting eachother anyway . 
  soldiers who die needlessly are even worse . 
  i would n't call ` dying for certain ' a risk . 
   poland can leave eu tomorrow and there 's nothing you can do . 
  they can , but before that they 're bound to that agreement . 
   `` i 'm proud of my government sending me and my citizens to slaughter people , whose only difference is that they live in an another geographical region , where my government ca n't tax them . '', 
  is n't this , kinda the definition , of cuckoldy ? 
  imagine if you replaced the word government with the words `` catholic church '' there . 
  i 'm not german . 
  you talked about bullets , implying poland would fire them at ( i presume based on this incident ) germany . 
   well , look if you are not gon na acknowledge that germany has blasphemy , i mean hate speech laws they do . 
  i 'm asking for proof of people being imprisoned ( they * can * , but none have ) and being raped . 
   inability to learn is also a trait of low iq people . 
  i can see that . 
  you do seem to have a low iq . 
   so that 's a null hypothesis ( you did n't google that term , did you ? ), 
  just one step removed . 
  so it 's not . 
   it 's like saying , `` only the thing the bible/quran says it 's true , it 's true , and i wo n't accept any other source '' . 
  no , that would be excluding * all * other sources of information , i 'm only excluding those run by a megalomaniacal government . 
   do n't see it , feel free to make an argument as to what i 've said is a false equivalance or reduction to absurdity . 
  equating abortion with killing babies ; false equivalence . 
  claiming abortion is eugenics ; reductio ad absurdum . 
   wtf ? 
  what book ? 
  i 'm not aware of any book that was written in a span of two millenia , must be pretty valuable . 
  it 's the bible , numbnuts . 
  [ and you did n't mention a book ? ], 
  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6js7xz/german_students_insulted_and_spit_in_the_face/djgr8or/ )  xenophobic much ? 
  or a muslim ? 
  neither . 
   first you assume i 'm polish because `` hurr durr polish hate muslims '' i assumed you were polish due to the contents of the article and your defending of the person spitting children in the face . 
   and now you assume i 'm an american because ... 
  i do n't even have an idea ( posting on t_d ? ) . 
  your gun fetish . 
  you wo n't shut up about guns . 
   discrimination based on a group is also a lack of critical thinking , therefore an indication of low iq . 
  uh , your iq must be at rock bottom . 
   now time for me to be a little bit xenophobic , genuine question , why are krauts so much in favor of the eu ? 
  discrimination and inability to distinguish flags , you must be wicked smart . 
   google it . 
  try keywords like : critical , thinking , low , iq , correlation , causation etc. 
  ca n't even back up your argument while the burden of proof is on you . 
  interesting .
