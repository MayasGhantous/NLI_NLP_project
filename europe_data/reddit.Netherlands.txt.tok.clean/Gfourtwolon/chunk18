   anyway , you 'd come begging in all 4 if 1-2 million migrants/year would come . 
  i doubt that many are being stopped by the fence . 
   btw : did your country fulfilled your quota a recent court case said we did . 
  i have n't noticed much of the brain drain coming here . 
  i * have * noticed drunk slavs working as construction workers , unless they 're the brain drain . 
   and us slaving to the western companies welcome to capitalism ? 
  that 's not much different here . 
   land grab ? 
   monopolistic infrastructure would n't this be a remnant of communism ? 
  that 's happening here more as well anyway . 
   for 16 years ( since joining eu ) how many times was that ee opposed the big ones ? 
  not often , because all you did was benefit . 
  now you 're asked to do something you refuse . 
   for once we decide to stand our ground and we get all the poo on the planet . 
  except some of those countries `` standing '' their ground already signed binding agreements regarding refugee relocation and others were overruled by democratically elected eu leaders . 
  the ones who signed the agreement and now refuse to cooperate are especially egregious . 
   we shall tear down that fucking fence and give you an actual chance to show your `` superiority '' . 
  most of the west was against that fence in the first place . 
  because the west * has * companies . 
  a former communist bloc would n't have many companies , no . 
  western companies would 've dominated the markets anyway . 
   you see , in democracy people get to decide what their country should do via proxy . 
  that proxy , the polish government of that time , signed the agreement . 
  that agreement is binding . 
  we 've improved your economy , rebuilt your infrastructure , and improved living conditions . 
  now you 're not willing to give something back for it ? 
  anti-eu sentiment spiked after the eastern european countries joined . 
  one of those issues was them migrating here . 
  poland is actively blocking refugees from being relocated there , though . 
  they can whine about hypocrisy all they want ; but they 're guilty of if themselves . 
  where in the fuck are you going to put the stadiums ? 
  the ijsselmeer ? 
  traffic circle . 
  america what the fuck . 
  how about you take some refugees ? 
  i think they wanted to run the pipeline through poland , an eu country , at first . 
  poland declined because they wanted to help ukraine , who was stealing gas meant for the western european market . 
  tada ; the current shitstorm . 
  we 're not increasing our gas consumption or import due to ns2 , it 's just circumventing gas-stealing , corrupt countries such as ukraine . 
  that , and ukraine stole gas . 
  i do n't think that 's related to just lowering the price , i think the price dropped too sharply . 
  there are a lot of spanish and portuguese students over here . 
  a portuguese housemate of mine is doing her masters degree here . 
  sending your own citizens to a foreign country to be tried before a foreign court would be sending a bad message . 
  football hooligans ? 
  in the netherlands , we do n't sing the anthem every morning at school , nor do i have to swear an oath of allegiance to anything or anyone . 
  start other projects that will open later because they started later ? 
  the tgv is n't going to top it at least , as there are no plans to have such trains go around europe . 
  shinkansen stop at more stations i think . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hikari_ ( train ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kodama_ ( train ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nozomi_ ( train ), 
  their commercial speed is similar . 
  and i think you should specify tgv vs shinkansen [ because the japanese have this on the way ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l0_series ), 
  f-35 is n't that expensive anymore and will be cheaper in the maintenance department due to mass-production of spare parts . 
  no , the cities are overcrowded , not the country . 
  japan has big cities , because nearly the entire population lives in those cities . 
  that leaves a lot of sparsely populated or uninhabited countryside , pulling the average down . 
  there was a poll among eu countries a while ago , and a lot of the west feels obligated to defend the east in case of war . 
  alright , you up for romanians being posted on our caribbean isles as part of an eu army ? 
  because if that does n't coincide with the eu `` goals '' , whatever they may be , the netherlands is n't going to join that initiative . 
  ireland ? 
  i do hope you realise that canada gets the good migrants , ones that are in no way comparable to the migrant populations in europe . 
   learn from us . 
  put an ocean between us and the middle east ? 
  fantastic idea !, 
  why have n't we thought of this before ? 
  it 's not that estonia is innovative , it 's just that russia is even less so . 
  ukraine already stole gas that was on its way to germany . 
  there 's no feasible way for germany to trust any ukrainian promises after that . 
  the rest of the license plate is , yes . 
  i 'm not sure if they even drink a lot of wine in japan . 
  does n't near everyone have ac there ? 
  many have been that way for centuries . 
  so poland , czechia , slovakia , and hungary should accept refugees then ? 
  i know all this , but they do n't line up with western european days of the week apart from monday and sunday . 
  what do you mean ? 
  \u706b\u66dc\u65e5 = kayoubi = fire day = tuesday \u6c34\u66dc\u65e5 = suiyoubi = water day = wednesday \u6728\u66dc\u65e5 = mokuyoubi = tree/wood day = thursday \u91d1\u66dc\u65e5 = kinyoubi = gold day = friday \u571f\u66dc\u65e5 = doyoubi = earth/ground day = saturday \u65e5\u66dc\u65e5 = nichiyoubi = sunday, 
  it has n't , but the waalkade has flooded several times . 
  source : 23 old groesbeker who spent 3 years in nijmegen . 
  what old european culture ? 
  we do n't really share one culture across europe . 
  the waal river tends to flood as well . 
  at least my time in nijmegen has taught me so . 
  the tsunami would have to magically cross the uk and ireland to get here . 
  earthquakes that heavy do n't happen over here either , unless the nam fucks up * massively * . 
  ... you have northern ireland . 
  warning shots , let their boats sink , tow them to the clostest port ( libya ) etc. 
  we do n't * have * to take care of the rest of the world . 
  shoot the migrants . 
  illegal border crossings will not be tolerated . 
  they 'll stop trying as well . 
  sanctions . 
  stop financially supporting them if they refuse . 
  simple , really . 
  similar in japanese . 
  the royal netherlands navy is anything but pleased with the nh90 . 
  not really . 
  all projections point to the f-35 price tag dropping significantly down the road . 
  the expensive part was the development phase . 
  it 'd actually be * more * expensive to upgrade rnlaf f-16 's to the latest block * and * perform maintenance on their eroding airframes . 
  i just think it 's incredibly funny how a country seen as an endless source of immigrants when it joined the eu is now turning its back on the eu because they do n't want to house refugees .
