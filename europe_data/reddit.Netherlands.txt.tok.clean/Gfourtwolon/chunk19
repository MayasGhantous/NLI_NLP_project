  this is normal ... 
   unfortunately what we should n't forget is that they did not spent a substantial amount of money on renewable sources . 
  and they fucked over students . 
  and teachers . 
  and healthcare . 
  because it 's about the ones in italy and greece , not the ones in germany . 
  the pvv used similar arguments against polish immigrants , just fyi . 
  strong and stable, 
  why ? 
  the netherlands pays more per capita than germany , luxembourg , and denmark . 
   why estonia , a nordic nation heh . 
  my grandparents ' generation does n't have nearly as many uni graduates as my generation does . 
  they did n't read a lot of books either . 
  we dutchies could use some more . 
  we 'd probably get a campaign referencing srebrenica ; when european allies left dutch peacekeepers without support and blame dutchbat for the incident to this very day . 
  the netherlands does not have tolls , and we 're a major transport hub . 
  i was wondering what you were talking about . 
  but this makes a lot of sense , yeah . 
  the raid on the medway saw the dutch navy engaging both englishmen and scots , though . 
  we do n't need those . 
  our governments usually collapse before they can call those . 
  voc trumped eic in every way possible . 
  actually , no . 
  the dutch east india company had the first recorded shipment of tea to europe in 1607 , the first one to do so . 
  you have warmer weather . 
  dutch healthcare has privately owned insurance companies . 
  the one in the netherlands is just a shelter they store equipment in . 
  they recently restocked it with abrams tanks and such . 
  because the kanji , or hanzi , used for the netherlands is that of the orchid . 
  i mean , it 's only one party less than the us . 
  not * that * much worse . 
  that 's a sensible answer , thanks . 
  that does n't answer the question . 
  and now the economic justification behind why we should push * harder * now than we did before . 
  ca n't save the planet if no-one 's buying your more expensive green energy . 
   if that became a serious issue then the eu would slap an export tax on us goods . 
  * would other markets do so though ? 
  and other markets would also apply those tarrifs ? 
  why ? 
  the us would enjoy cheaper production as a result from this , making europe unable to compete . 
  these are jobs focused on the uk in the first place . 
  great again ? 
  * indonesia here we come !, 
  http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/chart/getchart/themeky/29/groupky/181 this one ? 
  link ? 
  i can only find some map saying that  20 % means that we very strongly support an eu army . 
  where did you pull those stats from ? 
  because i sincerely doubt it . 
  poland wins that , just the witcher series is enough . 
  we have that already . 
  it can only improve if they did listen to the masses . 
  still do n't have it back . 
   the eu has pretty good net neutrality laws ? 
  they allow zero-rating . 
   and if you want you can have even higher standarts [ apparently not . ], 
  ( https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2017/04/24/dutch-regulator-overruled-in-t-mobile-net-neutrality-case/ ), 
  that 's how we pay for the roads . 
  stop fucking with our net neutrality , then . 
  that should n't matter , not in a democracy . 
  using emotions is different from emotional blackmail . 
  it 's true it includes trade , but it does n't * only * include trade . 
  it also includes military cooperation , which is a sensitive topic considering the state ukraine finds itself in . 
  i 'm saying that deciding the validity of the votes on how informed the voters are is undemocratic . 
  you * somehow * claim that it is . 
  and move the doorstep closer to other unstable countries so we 're back to step 1 ? 
  we can play thought police now ? 
  you ca n't vote [ insert party ] !, 
  that 's bad !, 
  votes towards [ insert party ] do n't count because [ insert party ] voters are n't informed !, 
   i doubt even a quarter were informed votes . 
  this should n't affect the way the government approaches it , though . 
  that would n't be democratic . 
   referendum was 61 % no at 31 % turnout , that 's like 19 % of voting population deciding for the rest 100 % . 
  that 's what happens when you do n't vote . 
  others decide for you . 
  but how is it beneificial to * us * ? 
  we 're sending money there , after all . 
  he should 've . 
  or just not allow referenda in the first place ; none of referenda we 've held were listened to anyway . 
  above the minimum requirement . 
  that 's all that counts , or we might as well get rid of the european parliament , as their elections enjoy similar turnouts . 
   well you directly supported russia by voting ` no ' . 
  i hope you were aware of that . 
  i do n't think you know what ` directly ' means . 
  also , we 're still sanctioning russia , causing more damage than the ` no ' vote ever could . 
   sometimes you ca n't stay neutral . 
  not neutral , * we 're already sanctioning russia because of the occupation of crimea * . 
   besides , there was nothing to gain from voting against it . 
  there 's nothing to gain from voting in favour of it . 
   it would only have been beneficial why ? 
  ukraine is very unappealing , economically speaking . 
   then do what will inevitably happen anyway and accept the treaty . 
  why would it inevitably happen ? 
  just refuse to sign it . 
  i do n't see how other countries could force us to do so without unwanted and illegal meddling in our political system . 
  if you just sign off on it , you have n't taken it into consideration . 
  just grow a pair and refuse to sign it . 
   with international agreement . 
  `` a treaty is an agreement under international law entered into by actors in international law , namely sovereign states and international organizations . 
  a treaty may also be known as an ( international ) agreement , protocol , covenant , convention , pact , or exchange of letters , '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty  i expect this ignorance in public but you had enough time to do some quick google to actually learn it .
