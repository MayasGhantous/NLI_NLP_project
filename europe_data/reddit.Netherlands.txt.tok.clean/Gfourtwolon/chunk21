  and that still does n't take into account the profession and sector they work in . 
  more women work in education ? 
  yeah , that 'll drive numbers down significantly . 
   and most organisations take in factors such as profession and working hours . 
  source ? 
  we 'll see that when the stats even out . 
  the anti-german rhetoric , however , is starting to grate on me as most of the countries complaining about germany seem to have dug their own grave by having lower retirement ages . 
  ca n't blame germany for what your own government did wrong , i 'm afraid . 
  the gender pay gap only takes into account the difference in salaray * regardless of profession or working hours * . 
  coincidentally , men tend to work in higher salary sectors * and work more hours * . 
  that 's not what i 'm pointing out . 
  you retire 5,7 years earlier than germans , and the state has to start paying pensions an average of 5,7 years earlier than the germany , as working people do not get pensions . 
  that 's a lot of money you 're wasting by retiring earlier . 
  russian slave labour ? 
  germans retire at a later lage , which means a more evenly spread working schedule and fewer pensions that have to be paid out . 
  [ but you do work less and spend much more in pensions as a result . ], 
  ( https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_6767_which_eu_countries_have_the_longest_working_life_n.jpg ), 
  [ hurr durr ] ( https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_6767_which_eu_countries_have_the_longest_working_life_n.jpg ), 
  that still makes the referendum valid . 
  refusing to vote is throwing your voice away , so those who abstained should n't complain , really . 
  they might be from either of the two holland provinces , they do n't seem to dislike it as much . 
  after the referendum , they returned four . 
  and they were found in a pro-russian villa , but were in the possession of ultra-nationalist ukrainian militia fighting on the government 's side , who tried to `` sell '' it back to the netherlands ( basically blackmail ) . 
   i do n't know enough about the case to be able to say why they do n't try to get back the paintings by force . 
  but do you know for sure that the paintings are still in the ukrainian territory ? 
  4 of the 24 have been returned . 
  we knew that they were in ukraine since 2015 , but the ukrainian government just sat on its hands and is then somehow surprised a country 's citizens vote against the association agreement when given the chance . 
  same with the mh17 radar images which they did n't share with the investigation team . 
   ukraine gets loans from the west , under more favourable conditions than some other country would , but it 's still a loan , not free money . 
  they wo n't pay it back . 
  much like greece was absolved of part of its debt , and still wants more from us . 
   or because they just want them to be more stable since their stability somehow helps with their own security . 
  it 'll disappear in a politician 's pocket . 
   if the current administrative does n't have the paintings under their control , how can it give it back ? 
  raid the militia . 
  we know who they are and where they are , ukraine just wo n't do anything about it . 
   you 're not handing them free money . 
  we are `` offering '' financial assistance ( free money ) . 
   you said it yourself , it was the previous admistration , so why blame the current one ? 
  they did n't give them back . 
  ca n't cooperate with people who wo n't cooperate, 
   but that 's not just their fault , that 's irrelevant . 
  i 'm not convinced handing them free money will fix any of it . 
  especially when the burden will , once again , go to the richer countries who are already funding most of the eastern european members . 
   what , when did this happen ? 
  they were `` found '' in 2015 by ultra-nationalist ukrainian militia in a villa belonging to a member of the previous administration . 
  the militia asked for $ 50 million to return the stolen , badly damaged paintings . 
  i do n't think the referendum should be considered when looking at the netherlands ' position . 
  ukraine is corrupt , unstable , unreliable ( they swing from eu to russia back to eu and then to russia again ) , and the ukrainian secret service was complicit in stealing several dutch golden age paintings ( which had n't been returned at the time of the referendum ) . 
  i support defending eastern-europe from russia , but voted ` no ' in the referendum . 
  belgium , for most of its history , was under either habsburg , spanish , or austrian rule . 
  it was under dutch rule from 1815 to 1830 . 
  to incentivise other countries in the eu to watch another country 's films ? 
  i would n't see a reason to force the issue otherwise . 
  they 're banning vpns . 
  i did n't say benelux . 
  i said netherlands . 
  swamps are n't very nice to live in . 
  2.000 years ago , maybe . 
  ca n't really call it dutch before the 16th century , though . 
  not a naval power ( which use a lot of trees to create a fleet ) , nor an industrial power . 
  poland was underdeveloped during the time period when most of the countries he mentioned cut down their primeval forests . 
  on the flipside , the netherlands now has more trees than it has ever had in history . 
  we do n't have any untouched nature , though . 
   so they must be doing something right , being underdeveloped for a long period of time and only catching up since the fall of the soviet union ? 
  any kind of regulation of previously public information sounds fascist to me . 
  let alone finig companies for hiring foreign labour . 
  surely there are better ways to incentivise hiring domestic labour ? 
  https://www.google.nl/?gws_rd=ssl#q=may+wants+new+internet https://www.google.nl/?gws_rd=ssl#q=uk+hiring+foreigners+2000+pounds, 
  `` may 's new internet '' and fines for companies hiring foreigners are starting to make them look like fascists , though . 
  i think he was suggesting that the tories are basically ukip at this stage , if not worse . 
  try `` nederland '' . 
  change the language . 
  problem solved . 
  would n't really call that unified . 
   of course it did . 
  point me to a unified german state in the 16th century . 
  citizens of a former french colony migrating to french-speaking countries is that odd to you ? 
  it has n't been our anthem for that long , though . 
  languages change over time , though . 
  you ca n't just transliterate old text while applying a modern context . 
  it was . 
  the dutch did n't see themselves as german during or after the eighty years ' war , but used it to refer to themselves as germanic . 
  heck , germany did n't even exist back then . 
  politically , probably . 
  individual culture . 
  we tend to give less of a crap about others and put our own wellbeing before that of others . 
  i would kill myself if i had to live in one , though . 
  try eating a ` kapsalon ' found in the netherlands . 
  you do not . 
  try making one with dutch parties . 
   people that still `` work '' until late in their 80s are people that have delegated their whole workload and just do `` business '' on golf courses and at luxury dinners . 
  that 's not true . 
  they still attend negotiations with other businesses at the very least . 
   putting your signiture under some papers that you did not even read is not hard work , source ? 
  because the king * has * to be informed by the ministers as per the constitution , so it 'd seem unlikely that he would n't read documents he 's expected to sign . 
   if you want to worship your king and make a big deal of every little thing he does , which is not what 's happening . 
   that is none of my business , then why are you in this thread ? 
  why are you bitching and moaning about our monarch when it 's none of your business ? 
  the people that do that are ceo 's or company presidents , which still is a lot of work and also a job that i 'd somewhat equate to being king .
