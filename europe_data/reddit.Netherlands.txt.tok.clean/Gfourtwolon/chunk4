  that 's exactly why . 
   the people in that metro were just average antons and olgas , just like us . 
  does n't matter . 
  russia does n't show sympathy to most of us either , they do n't even owe up to their own actions which result in civilian deaths ( mh17 ) . 
  no sympathy from me . 
  * ours * is a mix of french and german !, 
  house of orange ( french ) and house of nassau ( german ) to become house of orange-nassau ( ???? 
  it 's the netherlands ' motto . 
  german family with french motto ruling over britons . 
   no reason the rest of europe could n't have . 
  people do n't bother with locks on $ 15 bikes , because of kids with bolt cutters . 
  too many kids walking around with bolt cutters nowadays . 
  projecting a russian flag on buildings might have them try and annex it , after all . 
   perhaps in the us or maybe ** europe ** but as i said that 's the point is n't it ? 
  it 's the / r/europe subreddit after all . 
  that 'd be illegal as well . 
  the emulator in itself is illegal , as it uses copyrighted software . 
  many emulators work around it by not providing the console 's software , but require users to rip it from a console they own ( heh ) . 
   no i am talking about making an emulator that is line for line perfect code . 
  in such a way it can read the disk right from the pc blu-ray slot . 
  has n't been done before , but i 'm quite sure console manufacturers could successfully sue for using the copyrighted software required to read it . 
  you ca n't play it on an emulator without the rom , so it 'd be illegal . 
  unless you suggest ripping the content from the game you bought to make a rom so you can use it with the emulator , which would probably still be illegal . 
  ` tis the way copyright works . 
  buying a copy does not entitle you to download a rom and play it . 
  but i 'm only the messenger , i voted pirate party in every possible election i could . 
  good luck finding functioning lights on dutch bicycles in general . 
  ehh , aluminium probably . 
  drunk tourists throwing bikes in the canal cause it 's funny . 
  ( read : it 's the brits ), 
  i 'll admit ; i 've never seen them on bikes . 
  yes , it is . 
  you implied it with your neat row of pictures . 
  that 's still piracy . 
  edit : way to shoot the messenger , guys . 
  that 's not a pc release . 
  that 's piracy . 
  really ? 
  i 've always thought arnhem was pretty shit . 
  it wo n't . 
  do you see killzone on pc anywhere ? 
  guerilla games is a subsidiary of sony . 
  there 's no way they will ever release a game on pc . 
  they have the weird hand-pedal bike . 
  they 're kind of like tricycles , but also kind of not . 
  my loins ache at the mere thought . 
  they took dutch bikes and had the army use them for transport ( or melted them for steel , as resources were scarce ) during wwii . 
  it was a tragedy . 
  nah , tricycles are for plebs around here . 
   yeah on the first draft , for 4 years before it was definitly changed . 
  so it has n't always been the same . 
   that does n't seems to be yours either . 
  you 've been spouting nonsense for several posts now , and i 'm wrong ? 
  heh , looks like the `` arrogant french '' stereotype applies . 
  look at all that space we could polder . 
  actually , no . 
  your flag used to be inverted . 
   yeah , cia does n't know shit . 
  worse intelligence agency . 
  history is n't their job , mate . 
  you edited it , that 's cheating . 
   after about 1630 , the orange band tended to be replaced by a red one , as indicated by paintings of that time . 
  the cia factbook suggests that this was merely due to the orange dye used tending to fade to red over time an american intelligence agency about dutch history , alright . 
   also the color is different . 
  what you are refering too is this . 
  the blue is not your current color nor the one used in the comic . 
  they 're interchangeable . 
  17th century paintings also use the darker shade of blue currently found in the dutch flag . 
  heck , you said it in your original post . 
  we 've only officially adopted our current one in 1937 ( and only out of spite ) , we were using several variants before that . 
   to finish , this was merely a joke . 
  you do n't need to be triggered over it . 
  both flag have completely different source of inspiration . 
  at least use factually correct humour . 
  there 's literally a picture of a red-white-blue voc flag in the article , but no sign of an orange-white-blue one . 
  but eh , have some 17th century paintings . 
  [ 1653 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/reinier_nooms_-_de_zeeslag_bij_livorno.jpg/1920px-reinier_nooms_-_de_zeeslag_bij_livorno.jpg ) [ 1673 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/battleoftexel.jpg ) [ 1670 ] ( http://manchesterartgallery.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ludolf_backhuysen_1200.jpg ) but yeah , we definitely took it from a flag * designed in 1794 * . 
  red-white-blue was in use at the same time as the prinsenvlag . 
  sorry to break it to you . 
  it was adopted later , but designed and used way , * way * earlier than the french flag . 
  dutch flag is older . 
  the first one does n't make sense . 
  amsterdam is expensive as fuck and does n't have * any * government institutions . 
  they 're just pixels . 
  greece fucked its own economy , and was quite proficient at doing so . 
  might as well remove the netherlands from this plan , then . 
   people who are supposed to be doing science should n't be influenced by religious bias . 
  they are n't . 
  it just reflects the roots of the uni . 
   at least you admit that there is '' some '' influence , right ? 
  shinto ? 
  well yeah , i 'm studying japanese for business purposes ( trade etc. 
  ) , culture ( e.g. 
  religion ) is part of that . 
  you could remove any course regarding the culture of the country you 're studying the language of , but that 'd only cause trouble later down the line . 
   my point is that there should n't be '' any !!!! '', 
  religious influence in any univeristy . 
  cause that is the biggest insult to science imo . 
  how would anyone study theology , history , etc. 
  at uni then ?
