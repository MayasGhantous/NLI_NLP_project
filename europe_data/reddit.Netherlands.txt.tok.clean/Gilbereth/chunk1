ehh . . [ close ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqtqe2vnpbg ) . 
   why georgia left the ** cis ** made me think of [ these guys ] ( https://youtu.be/od-kurfsbo0?t=38 ) . 
  netherlands closed its borders ? 
  afaik they do some superficial checks because of the recent terrorist attacks but the borders are still pretty much open as can be , i think . 
  why do greeks think this is a thing ? 
  yup , it is . 
  in dutch we no longer use the plural , which would be * nederlanden * ; `` netherlands '' . 
  no problem : j, 
  and as such , there is this running joke on the / r/thenetherlands where we 're always happy to end above finland on some random ranking or something . 
  the finns never seem to care , however . 
  it happens more and more and thus some have suggested swapping the finns for the swedes , but they 're already busy with the danes . 
  i guess it just would n't be the same . 
  the way i was tought hofstede 's stuff it was more like `` let 's group up traits a , b , c under the name ` masculine ' and traits x , y , z under the name ` feminine ' . 
  so not so much that the traits are inherently masculine of feminine but they 're just the names given to them . 
  eh , why , if i may ask ? 
  i have the feeling that they do n't gain a lot from getting indepence . 
  it 's not like they can compete on a international level anyway ( or at least most of the small islands ) , from a practical point of view it might be better to be protected by a bigger entity that has had a connection with your island for hundreds of years and have a tourist business going on instead of possibly being annexed by some developing nation that wants your resources . 
  okay , i must admit that my post was mostly meant to adress the similarities between danish and dutch culture , and forgot that on a national level german culture * is * rather different from dutch culture in the process . 
  i still had mostly * north-western * germany in my head from a different post . 
  my apologies . 
  i am very much aware of the differences . 
  i live close to the border , travel there on occasion and work with germans a few days in a week . 
  but you 're right , i have not yet been able to move to a different country , sadly enough . 
  exactly . 
  i have a danish friend that has lived here for a few years now and recently i jokingly said that dutch is 50 % english . 
  he laughed and said that it was more like 50 % danish to him . 
  obviously it 's not actually 50 % , but it does raise a point about how it is perceived . 
  also , people do not seem to like my posts about this subject , apparently , as i 'm getting downvoted for some reason . 
  i just want to clarify that i 'm not claiming that danish and dutch are the closest of languages by any means , if that makes any difference . 
  how do * you * not get throat cancer by not speaking like that ? 
  we 're spitting all the cancer out into the faces of those standing opposite of us !, 
   honestly , it 's not that bad . 
  it 's just an everyday letter / sound for a dutchman . 
  that it 's `` harsh '' and `` ugly '' is - funnily enough - subjective , yet it 's apparently a very common opinion for those not speaking the language . 
   for a country that actually belongs to another cultural region , the number of similarities is striking . 
  that might be noteworthy . 
   the thing is , those cultural regions are almost always arbitrary . 
  i doubt that - other than the change of the official language being spoken - the culture * really * changes . 
  the nations that we know today are relatively new in comparison to the cultures that lived before them ( and were n't displaced ) . 
  i often hear people acting as if the scandinavions are a completely different kind of folk than , say , the dutch ~ ~ or germans ~ ~ in terms of culture , language , etc. 
  i think that sometimes that difference is overestimated . 
  i 've been having that feeling for a while as well now . 
  i 'm always filled with joy when i find out that there 's this expression in a danish series that 's almost the same in dutch or the like . 
  this goes even further when considering the local regiolects/languages in the north . 
  i 've been watching * follow the money ( dk : bedrag ) * for a while now and kept noticing that the mothers always use the word * skat * when talking to their kids . 
  then i suddenly realised we do the exact same thing with * schat * . 
  it 's weird but also really cool . 
   there is no way that the danes are closer to the dutch than the flemish . 
  i do n't know . . like you said , if you 're from brabant , zeeland , limburg , etc. 
  then obviously flemish people are closer but as someone from the north ( groningen , frisia , etc. ), 
  i ca n't help but feel more similar to southern scandis and northern germans . 
  i still love you flemish folks , though !, 
  ca n't blame you :d, 
  interestingly not all images are postcard-like images . 
  appingedam is about as standard and boring as it gets ( sorry appingers ) . 
  so to make this list even more wrong , i 'd suggest pics of something like esonstad instead . 
  like [ this one ] ( http://www.henri-floor.nl/plaatjes/2008/flal/20080308/foto07.jpg ) , [ this one ] ( http://elkedagvakantie.nl/images/esonstad6.jpg ) and last but not least [ this one ] ( http://esonstadonline.nl/media/home/home_slider.1.jpg ) . 
  does it get disqualified when the whole thing is a commercial place where you can spend nights in one of those houses ? 
  exactly !, 
   the dutch , as usual , will ignore all nuance and pinpoint to their indeed marvelous spatial planning and how they 're so much better than us . 
  also , shitting on other countries always results in upvotes in this sub , true european style . 
  you know that , behind all of that , we still love the lot of you . 
  what would we do on this planet without those glorious accents or great waffles !, 
   not arabs but islamized germans great , now i 'm imagining nazis dressed with turbans and robes . 
  is it still 1st of april in the colonies ? 
  like in dutch `` zweef '' !, 
  ( which is pronounced like `` svef '' , though ), 
  well , the article does specify that it 's also just for belgians . 
  when a third thinks that the accent is n't that glorious , and only a fifth considers it sexy ( compared to nls 17 procent ) i have a hard time taking that as `` generally '' . 
  but that could just be me , of course . 
  the earth is generally considered to be flat as well . 
  whoa , go easy on those dutchisms . 
  also , comparing french and dutch is n't that effective , really . 
  although a long long time ago frankish kings conquered roman gallia , they adapted and spoke the local version of vulgar latin which started to develop into old french . 
  although old dutch/old low franconian would definitely have an influence , they both come from two seperate language families . 
  ( germanic vs romance ) . 
  but that 's kinda common knowledge i guess . 
  [ to add to * that * , the voc is also the company that had the highest value in history ] ( https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/photos/most-valuable-companies-ever-adjusted-for-inflation-1351801906-slideshow/most-valuable-companies-in-history-adjusted-for-inflation-photo--1113431046.html ) , and dwarfed other east india companies for a long time :  statistically , the voc eclipsed all of its rivals in the asia trade . 
  between 1602 and 1796 the voc sent almost a million europeans to work in the asia trade on 4,785 ships , and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of asian trade goods . 
  by contrast , the rest of europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795 , and the fleet of the english ( later british ) east india company , the voc 's nearest competitor , was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships and a mere one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the voc . 
  the voc enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century . 
  ( good ol' wikipedia ) the trading mentality lives on to this day , i 'd say . 
  i do care and i 'm from groningen . 
  so i guess that point is moot . 
   on second thought , i oppose this plan . 
  i do n't want to have to cycle through the snow and up a mountain . 
  those are two glorious things that the netherlands lack !, 
  why would you forfeit such a chance ?!, 
  i 'm all for it , but would n't including the lowlands mean that belgium and luxembourg are also in ? 
  that * would * get a bit crowded , i think . 
  they talk like a belgian being strangled . 
  that 'd be the swedes , i think . 
  a dane sounds more like a choking saxon from the north . 
   is not enough to offset that . 
  [ well , it 's like the netherlands , but somewhere else . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjj1jcaffcm ) that 's close enough i 'd say . 
  but . . but . . we ca n't resist the waffles for much longer !, 
  you 'll need the lowlands as well then . 
  we 'll probably be in anyway , since there 'd be some fine beaches in the south !, 
  low saxon is still spoken , but mostly by older people .
