  ( 30/40 + , although depends on the region . 
  sometimes only 60 + speak it ) however , it seems to be improving at the moment and more and more young people are becoming interested in the local and often ancient languages or dialects . 
  also , younger people from certain regions might speak some sort of mix of both standaardnederlands and the language/dialect with dutch being the `` foundation '' and local words as added vocabulary . 
  thank ze lord you are not . 
  [ there are already enough german invasions on our beaches as it is . 
  ] ( http://satwcomic.com/day-at-the-beach ), 
  the [ original saxons ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/290-width/images/print-edition/20130119_eum935.png ) or [ weird saxony ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/map-dr-saxony.svg ), 
  that 's better . 
  [ except that no one dares to fuck with switzerland ] ( http://www.badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=31684493594 ) for like , what , a thousand years ? 
  ca n't say that for england . 
  it 's not about terrorist drones . 
  it 's about drones who are causing danger by flying in closed airspaces . 
  the police officer mentions that there have already been incidents where ambulance helicopters wanted to land at places but could n't because there were people playing around with drones . 
  in the video , they say they 're researching various methods to protect the eagles ' legs , such as adding defensive scales on the legs . 
  although i agree that the legs being damaged might be a problem , it seems to me that eagles are much faster , have way more control over the drone and do n't make as much of a hassle when taking down drones . 
  this is extra important in urban areas , which are relatively more common in the netherlands , being a country of cities rather than lots of land . 
  well , to be honest i figured it would be that after recalling my best brabantic and limburgish and reading it five times . 
  my version is a saxon version of that sentence . 
  and in the south * only * . 
  i ca n't understand this even in written form , let alone when someone says it to me . 
  in the cold north , try something like `` ej , wat hastu schiere oogn . '', 
  instead . 
  that the netherlands can be traversed in a day by foot is irrelevant when it comes to our dialects , funnily enough . 
  on the other hand , dutch still uses * koning * with only a minor vowel change and the - az being omitted . 
  i heard that in the 1600s there was a bit of dutch influence on gotland due to the dutch being very active with the baltic trade , maybe that 's why they use something like * bos * instead of * skog * ? 
  not enough , that 's how much i had . 
  on the other hand ... 
  well , you * could * argue that he is switching between his two arms . 
  i mean , the other * other * arm could be the same arm as the arm he began with . 
  i think . 
  maybe . 
  neither do i , which is why i never go to the south . 
  well , they must be very hungry , then ' :d, 
  i agree , these women look awful . 
  omg , that 's quite the slaughter . 
  does that happen often ? 
  yup . 
  like i said , it is quite easy to understand written danish ( and to a slightly lesser degree , swedish ) even though the spoken forms are pretty much gibberish to me . 
  although i must say that i start to recognise words in the dialogue from * the bridge * , which always brings a smile on my face : j, 
  why , thank you !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ compliment ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ an ^ ^ ^ ^ insult ? 
  so whose fault is it ? 
  is it the fault of the violent swedish women ? 
  the dutch who have language resembling some awful form of gutterspeech * ? 
  or the finns , for using their infamous and dreaded staring skills ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ * ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ ^ true !, 
  swedish ( like danish and norwegian ) has a rather suprising amount of words and expressions that are the same or very close to the ones used in dutch . 
  grammar and pronunciation messes up the ( partial ) intelligibility that might have been otherwise , which is unfortunate . 
   but that is also true for people from the achterhoek . 
  or frisia . 
  or , like , the other 50 % of the country . 
  hmm . 
  there is actually snow in the netherlands right now , but only in the northern half . 
  benelux into nordic !, 
  benelux into nordic !, 
  yup . 
  i have a tiny collection of guilders/gulden as well , it 's pretty cool to have a piece of history in your house . 
  hmm , no , the lowlands are definitely not checkered with dikes . 
  i guess there are a few areas where dikes are more common and numerous , as is shown by the link , but in general dikes are absent in places far away from the sea ( a few kilometres away from the shoreline ) . 
  the moment you 're talking about a dike in an area that 's not really threatened by water , you 're actually talking about artificial elevations . 
  artificial elevations * can * be pretty , but long strips piercing the land whilst also creating lots of noise are definitely awful . 
  regardless , there is no real benefit to these elevations . 
  that 's why they are a bad solution if you want to preserve the land a bit . 
  i do n't think a dike helps protect against a flood when it 's in the middle of the country , [ https://i.ytimg.com/vi/owi0dsqkwie/maxresdefault.jpg] ( and dikes are n't that large anyway ) . 
  i think you mean a hill , but an elevated motorway in the middle of flat wildlands does n't look that pretty . 
  have you ever seen dikes ? 
  they 're mostly on the shorelines and near rivers . 
  they 're often considered as recreational places as well , and usually they 're not that big . 
  in addition to that , most of the major cities are not near the sea , so there 's no need for highways near the shores . 
  tl ; dr it has no use , it 's unpractical and it costs money . 
   euh , yes we are out of room . 
  we 're the most densily populated country in europe experiencing the largest population growth of the century . 
  the two remaining trees in this country can make room for a solar panel , or we make more efficient use of the limited space we have . 
  although we are n't entirely out of room , it is precious space and nobody wants precious space being filled up with wide and ugly ( arguable ) fields of solar panels . 
  creative and efficient use of space is highly preferred in the netherlands because space * is * somewhat rare . 
   not even 1 % of all available roof surface is covered in solar panels , and that 's the lowest of the low hanging fruit . 
  perhaps , but those are for private use , right ? 
  not everybody is willing or able to buy solar panels . 
  it 's not like the government can force civilians to put solar panels on their roofs . 
  at least you guys have normal winters . 
  if the weather stays as it is now , we 'll have christmas in summer . 
  holland + the other ten provinces , yes . 
  they 're now saying it 's 26 , although that number is still unconfirmed . 
  woops , my bad . 
  heh , it 's ~ ~ putin 's ~ ~ * russia 's * personal geographical punching bag . 
  that 's often probably more due to the rather curious quality of the topography skills of the americans than it is the fault of the brits , though . 
  we named an entire country !, 
  that 's not too bad , i 'd say . 
  do n't mind us , we 're just casually naming parts of the world after our own regions , [ like ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_netherland ) [ we ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_zealand ) [ usually ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_brazil ) [ do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=new_holland ) . 
  i think an important thing to remember is that ij almost never gets stressed . 
  that has probably to do with the fact that many words that have ` ij ' in them and are important for the clause are already stressed versions of non ` ij ' words by themselves . 
  stressed pronouns are a good example of this . 
  think of ` jij ' vs ` je ' , ` zij ' vs ` ze ' , ` wij ' vs ` we ' and of course ` mijn ' vs 'm 'n', 
  same thing goes for dutch . 
  with a few exceptions , they are hardly ever used . 
  i believe i saw somewhere that because of that , as well as the fact that in netherlandic dutch ` ij ' is technically considered as one letter , that a stressed ` ij ' would then be correctly written as ' \u00edj ' , not 'm \u00edj\u0301 ' . 
  but that 's just nl dutch . 
  i would n't know about belgian dutch . 
  is correct .
