  ( i was going to question myself if this would be proper dutch low saxon , but then i remembered that there is no proper dutch low saxon . ), 
  yup . 
  i heard before that germany dodged the economical crisis a bit , but i always felt that it is only since one or two year that our economy is picking up again . 
  then again , that 's just me . 
  ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ want ^ ^ ^ andorra , ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ cute, 
  if they did n't , why would i be drinking it , then ?

  yes , we were teamed up with spain . 
  spain !, 
  they 're , like , our nemesis . 
  i 'd rather share a cup of tea with a brit . 
  - cough - * dutch * * courage * - cough - also , i just drank some tea with [ the exact same name as your user name ] ( http://static.webshopapp.com/shops/005147/files/013692401/pickwick-delicious-spices-herfststorm.jpg ) . 
  is that a coincidence or were you just a lil ' lazy ? 
  good . 
  i do not mind some more kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6t in my belly !, 
  why do we get all the crappy nations ? 
  ah , you know what , blasting each other to bits is a waste of time ( that we could 've spend on drinking tea instead ) . 
  i call for a truce , as is befitting for truly civilised gentlemen like us !, 
  * what * * say * * you , * * dear * * chap ? 
  us , of course !, 
  aside from a good ol' tussle here and there , they 've been our buddies up until the world wars . 
  we need a new flag though . 
  it was cool when we started it , but this tricolour thing is starting to get mainstream . 
  similar , but not the same . 
  it 's more or less simplified dutch with a funky twist to it . 
  united netherlands stronk !, 
  or if you 're willing to stretch it a little , south africa 's flag . 
  then again , luxemburg 's flag is just a copy of the dutch [ ` statenvlag ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statenvlag ) . 
  it 'd still be an outdated flag , but it 's better than having another country 's flag . 
  ( imagine the horror if belgium 's flag were there instead !, 
  for me family , sort of . 
  i consider the belgians , luxemburgers and germans as brothers . 
  the swedes , danes and norwegians i would consider as close ( r ) cousins ( although i have the feeling this does not go the other way around ) . 
  the rest is either too far away or have their own buddies . 
  now excuse me , i have some drowning to do . 
  swamps , weird languages , always on the top of online rankings and no belgians . 
  the more i go on the more i like the idea !, 
  aw shit , i 'm sad that we sold them . 
  they 're so sexy ( for a tank ) . 
  swamp germans , sea germans . . we do n't know anymore !, 
  calling the wadden `` mud north of friesland '' is like calling the amazon rainforest `` a oversized bunch of trees in brazil '' . 
  but i guess there is little that we dutch folk can do to change your opinion . 
  :( a shame , because it 's definitely a very interesting place !, 
  shit , that might even be a valid tactic !, 
  thanks man !, 
  yes , that 's what i 've been saying , but i also offered an alternative . 
  i realise it 's not the preferred use , of course . 
  actually , that would n't work in german/dutch/swedish / etc. 
  `` germanspeakcountries '' * would * work . 
  the - ing turned it into an adjective and you ca n't slap that on a noun and call it a day . 
  there 's more than one ` g ' sound being used in dutch , some more `` harsh '' than others ; some as soft as a pillow . 
  you monster !, 
   seaxe kiek wie we doar hem ' !, 
  ailanners fan over ' t wotter die zittn te snakkn over ons . 
  boom ` dien hem ' we doarveur willy oal . 
  * nou most tou ` ns eem opholdn , tammo !, 
  not even that , mostly the length and the placement of the comma 's . 
  wel , that , and * idiootti * , 
  is that . . is that a witcher reference ? 
  i like how i do n't know finnish , but still instantly recognise that this is the navy seal copy pasta :d, 
   holy poop . 
  why , yes . 
  yes it is . 
  hun germans ? 
  is that a reference to the name given to germans in ww1 ? 
  mof germans work , too , but i thought german germans did the job . 
   what always blows me away are the countries / peoples that are right next to each other , with no appreciable natural boundaries , and the word is completely different . 
   between germany and france , though , ( ... ) it 's basically people on opposite sides of a valley speaking completely different languages . 
  i do n't want to sound rude here or anything , but , emm . . 
  i think that 's how languages work ? 
  mwhahaha , even us petty west-germanic scrubs have pagan names for days !, 
  finally the tables have turned !, 
  ^ ^ ^ jk ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ you !, 
  at least we 're not german germans !, 
  i think it 's because the name * odin * differed slightly between west - and north germanic languages . 
  in old english , old saxon , old dutch ( or old low franconian if you will ) , you spoke of wodan instead of odin . 
  this changed a bit , and the 'd ' wore off . 
  ( e.g. 
  you write * wednesday * but say * `` whensday '' * . 
  same happened with the other languages , but they altered their spelling . 
  add to that that north germanic languages tend to have dropped out the ` w ' in some instances ( e.g. 
  wolf -  ulv ) , and you get something like * onsdag * . 
  that 's my take on it . 
   especially how to grow some balls and do n't behave like a little grils . 
  oh yes , staging coups and then blaming some old guy for it is truly an example for all . 
   pedestrianisation and then they say we 're the one with long words . . , 
  what do you mean ? 
  that first image has a house that has all these weird square thingies that almost but not quite form swastikas . 
  ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ bad ^ ^ ^ person ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  we get weapons , you get tulips . 
  fair trade , right ? 
  dutch forces also use the c8nld in combination with the hk416 if i 'm correct . 
  is n't the hk416 a `` blend '' of the g36 and the m4 ? 
  that 's what i 've heard somewhere . 
  would make it less of a clone if it was , though . 
   glad we do n't have to deal with that in america . 
   hell no .
