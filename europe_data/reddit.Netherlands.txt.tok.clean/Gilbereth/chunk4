  propaganda would n't work in the land of the free and the home of the brave . 
   / r/executivemonkey that 's your answer right there . 
  they will be replaced with bicycles . 
  they 're much more efficient , cleaner , easier to maintain , easier to adapt for all kinds of combat roles , and - above all else - they are * cheaper * . 
  [ they 've been doing some testing already , apparently . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yprlf21miy ) they can be deployed in 2021 . 
  russia 'd better watch out . 
  this . 
  i 'm doing an international study and had some foreign students in the first few months of the study that assumed i knew stuff about drugs and all that . 
  the stuff is tolerated but that 's all . 
  but i guess there are worse stereotypes in the world . 
  hell , of all things that the netherlands has done in the past i 'm glad people take us for some innocent drug using country at times instead of the money-usurping monster we had become at a time long ago . 
  actually , we 've already started banning cars from city centers , favoring bikes and public transport , 
  the very same goes for their respective religious counterparts . 
  dicks are dicks , religious or not . 
  hmm , i feel from personal experience that most men are well above that height . 
  then again , i 've heard that in the north men are taller than in the south of the netherlands , so that might explain why it does n't line up with the average . 
  that , and the swedes and danes are usually too busy with each other to care about us , so finland will have to do . 
  there is a difference ? 
  hmm  in hamburg is st\u00f6rtebeker op 20 oktober 1401 staande onthoofd . 
  that 's pretty badass  after the end of the war , the victual brothers continued to capture merchant vessels for their own account and named themselves `` likedeelers '' ( literally : equal sharers ) seems like an interesting dude to me . 
  then name it in it 's true low franconian name and call it * frankenrijk * . 
  you monster, 
  what 's a `` belgium '' ? 
  i think you meant * rightful dutch clay * ? 
  ca n't we just form a happy hanze 2.0 with the scandies again ? 
  dutch to talk to flowers ? 
  what , first you want to install a new reich and now you want to kill nature , too ? 
  you monster !, 
  interesting !, 
  i 'd say that tea has been popular here for a long time , arguably as long as it has been introduced . 
  i myself love some [ * herfststorm thee * ] ( http://www.derooijgroothandel.nl/images/image/pickwick_ds_herfststorm1.jpg ) , or `` autumn storm tea '' , which is made from apple and cinnamon . 
  great for a rainy , bleak autumn day in northern europe for sure !, 
  although recently i 've stopped drinking tea and now mostly still drink * milk * , which is more normal here than it is in some other places from what i understand/experienced . 
  well , not much to elaborate on , really . 
  although the english are known to be tea lovers , the dutch ( or at least in the northern parts ) have quite the love for it as well ( with ceylon having been a dutch colony for a while ) . 
  it 's just not part of the stereotype , and an increasing amount of people switch to coffee at some point in their life . 
  but , for example , if my dad does n't get his tea in the morning and in the evening there 'd better be an emergency or something else that caused it , otherwise he 'd probably be dead . 
  as far as i know , whenever not replaced with coffee , tea is still a big part in dutch culture as well . 
  someone commented that only the last - ta comes from thee , and that the combination means `` tea herbs '' . 
  that 'd be a plausible situation , i guess . 
  huh ? 
  allright , hang on a moment , let me get germany to reform the hanze league . 
  why would n't it count as one ? 
  i 'm sorry to break it to you but the netherlands did n't participate in world war 1 . 
  not sure if belgium would count as dutch , either . 
  i knooow , but he was saying that , not me . 
   the netherlands ( ... ) are just breakaway bits of the medieval german empire i think the fact that we 've been out for about 500 years has something to do with the fact that we 've developed a unique cultural identity . 
  ( or at least claim to have one . ), 
  i think his point was that dutch is basically german but with only a few tiny differences , instead of , y' know , what you seem to think he meant . 
   everyone knows that dutch people = cool germans . 
  except for the fact that dutch people are n't germans , but i get what you mean , of course . 
   if you are germany 's us , then i feel sorry for you already . 
  uh , i 'm not sure if i understand . 
  is being canada really crappy or . . what ? 
  care to elaborate ? 
  or maybe because we 're also extremely cool ? 
   in addition to that , i think the netherlands is one of the neighbouring countries that has had the least amount of conflicts with germany . 
  ( ww2 is the only thing i can think of atm ) . 
  so we 've always been cool with each other , really . 
  fair enough . 
  it 's just that recently i got some thedonald stuff thrown at my face , so i ca n't tell whether or not they are * actually * being serious that well anymore , sadly enough . 
  right . 
  i think you forgot the * / s * here . 
   those children are healthy and supervised in a playful environment . 
  i 'm glad to see that the police spends its time elsewhere on more important matters . 
  ftfy . 
  you 're welcome . 
  i hope this will stop people from making `` oh you 're tall because otherwise you 'll drown '' jokes . 
  [ our dikes will do their jobs . 
  in dutch it 's mostly the same , save for some different ways of spelling the names . 
  most of the changes are pretty regular , such as * - ia * turning into * - i\u00eb * or * - ije * .

   i do n't speak german but it seems like it 's pronounced : us-ter-ike . 
  eh . . [ not really ] ( https://translate.google.nl/#de/nl/%c3%96sterreich ) ( press the `` listen '' button ) . 
  i did n't , but okay . 
  it 's more that i find it interesting that german got the same status as french or dutch , even though the amount of german speaking belgians is nowhere near the amount of dutch or french speaking belgians . 
  you mean namibia ? 
  yea , it 's indeed a bit weird , though it happens occasionally , i think . 
  it 's a good thing i never said that , then . 
  well , afaik it 's just a few villages and towns at the eastern border that are german but they somehow managed to make german the third official language . 
  . . * dammit * . 
  i 'd better go there as soon as possible , then . 
   it 's also likely that eu members would find it harder to get visas to live in post-brexit britain , reducing their opportunities to learn english from native speakers . 
  w-what ? 
  as if i learned my level of english by coming to the uk . 
  hell , i 've never even been in an anglophone country . 
  internet 's a thing , you know . 
  did n't you know ? 
  jutland was nuked by angry greenlanders last night !, 
  as far as i know ( some versions of ) colourblind people differentiate shades better than colours . 
  so they might see , for example , a bigger difference between light brown and dark brown than that they can see between dark brown and red . 
   have you ever been to estonia ?
