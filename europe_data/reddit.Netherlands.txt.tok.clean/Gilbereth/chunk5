  ** could you find it on a map ? 
  ** come on , that 's just insulting . 
  eh , the origin of the dutch flag is n't certain , but certain sources suggest that the red-white-blue flag is actually older than the prince 's flag . 
  ( albeit with different shades . ), 
  i believe that technically they 're both still part of the same language together with luxembourgish : [ central franconian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_franconian_dialects ) . 
  low franconian is ( basically ) [ dutch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/low_franconian_languages ) and high franconian is spoken in [ southern germany . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_franconian_german ) . 
  all come from frankish , a germanic language spoken by the franks which eventually conquered and gave their name to what we now call * france * . 
  eh , it 's up to discussion . 
  depending on how you take it . 
  after all , it 's sung in first person as if it were sung by william of nassau himself . 
  now , it happens to be that this fellow came out of what is modern day germany , so it 'd be technically correct to say that he 's german , and the word used in the modern anthem is the exact same as the word for `` german '' ( duits ) . 
  however , this word comes from an older word which referred to basically all continental germanic peoples ( diets ) and this is still reflected in the way that in english , * we * are called dutch and not the germans . 
  so it can mean either , but i 'm rather confident that when it was written that the latter meaning was meant . 
  glad to see you survived !, 
  lots of randoms were attacking smaller projects left right 'n centre and a large part of the organised community wanted to attack you to claim more lands . 
  fortunately , our mods and diplomatic relations were able to prevent it , and after the pat & mat plans started popping up , people had a new goal to work on . 
  yeah , yeti is being rekt by randoms . 
  which is a shame , because it wo n't do much good for our relations with pretty much anyone else . 
  the official discord is actively trying to stop it , though . 
  but we 've also got other projects at the moment . 
  czechs are allied/friendly and officially we 're making [ buurman & buurman ( a je to ) ] ( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/298015008791461890/298417982512824321/a_je_to_2.png ) to commemorate this friendship . 
  yea , that 's us . 
  we set up shop above you and sweden , and plopped down our anthem while we were at it . 
  initially all the hearts that were there were dutch ( but there were n't as many ) , but after a while someone suggested putting other neighbouring flags in there as well . 
  i mean , we 're pretty chill with you guys so why not show it ? 
  op is a unimaginative nazi . 
  we should impose sanctions , if you ask me . 
  it 's nice to see that even a low saxon that far away still has a number of similarities to the dutch variants !, 
  especially * `` rostock , mien oll vadderstadt '' * is practically identical to how it 'd be said here in groningen ( in low saxon , that is ) . 
  that 's . . good to hear . 
  i think . 
  * `` rutte says he 's doing what he can to de-escalate the situation - *  * ik zal furie over u schyten en gy zult er in verzuypen . 
  * * . . but has been unsuccesful so far . 
   [ das war ` ne witze . . ] ( https://youtu.be/bcfxfpsv6rw?t=98 ) . 
  ha , got me there !, 
  you too . 
  ( ` er ' in dutch is n't a personal pronoun , that 'd be `` hij '' . 
  but of course , you 're a `` zij '' . 
   ` er ' means as much as ` there ' in `` there is a spy among us '' . ), 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uf81ikqnrw ) . 
   ( officially ) . 
  * officially * it is pa\u00edses baixos if i 'm not mistaken , it 's just that holanda/holland/etc is an accepted alternative in many languages , even though it is not so much in dutch and to a lesser degree in surrounding languages . 
   the only thing we know is our land is a lot higher than the netherlands ... i thought we were lowland bros. :(, 
  both translations work . 
  would n't it be blackbergh ? 
  burgh is related to borough , or at least so i thought . 
  it 's the same in dutch : berg -  mountain burg \\ borg -  borough, 
  * do n't mind us , we 'll just borrow this ship for a while . 
  and that name in turn comes from a latin name for a tribe that lived in the lowland ; the batavi . 
  yea , weird stuff . 
  the former flag and now part of the coat of arms of groningen ( https://nl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/wapen_van_groningen_ ( provincie ) ) , which is basically a mirrored frisian flag ( https://nl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ommelanden_ ( groningen ) # / media/bestand % 3aommelanden.jpg ) but older , also has more heart shaped lilies . 
  however , they do specify something , and stand for the number of * ommelanden * ( lands that surround the city ) . 
  edit : links are dead because they use '' ( ) '' , i 'll link the info pages instead . 
  i think it 's just a northern european thing , rather than just something that 's frisian . 
  we should 've known earlier !, 
  he 's a back-up belgian after all !, 
  the same lilies ( fake hearts ) are also on the danish coat of arms , btw , 
  in dutch , words change gender depending on whether they are dimunitives or not . 
  other than that gender is effectively dead in dutch save for a few archaic constructions like these . 
  nah , i 've seen loads of foreigners do it . 
  spanish people are generally not that good with dutch words . 
  also , there 's actual names for the sound , rather than calling it ` prehistoric gurgling ' or the like . 
  it 's just a sound ... : t, 
  also , i feel like * ij * should also be shown on this map , as it is regarded as a single character , despite not looking like on when typed on a keyboard . 
  netherlands-belgium also have some love-hate thing going on . 
  he was also talking about noise pollution , i think . 
  perhaps roundabouts are more preferable than junctions in certain situations . 
   rather than that dutch thingy with way too many consonants . 
  that 's funny , seeing that come from a german . 
  the brits were secretly scared of you guys going all danelaw on them a second time , 
  there are a few dutch movies about it , but the quality of such attempts are often somewhat . . disputed . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=minvbv-k9ni ) 's a trailer of one such movie ( kenau ) . 
  i thought it was decent . 
  then there 's also [ michiel de ruyter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glwnk5x1scy ) . 
  even though historical timeframe is full of material to work with , i found the movie to try to fit too much in one movie , there 's too much flagwaving , it used too much cgi and the acting of mdr was often lacking , in my opinion . 
  it 's not about the dutch revolt , but rather about the life of the [ legendary admiral ] ( http://badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=579429818534 ) and its role in the many wars against the surrounding powers . 
  hmmpf , what is this ? 
  bikes stolen by the germans ? 
  seems we need to give m\u00fcnster another beating to get our bikes back , boys !, 
  apparently they have n't learnt their lesson at [ groningen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_groningen ) . 
  ... which is present in dutch as well . 
  i 'm assuming it corresponds to the dutch * drie eikels * . 
  that 's an awesome name . 
  why does this have a nsf - ... oh , i see . 
  interesting design , i 'd say . 
  well , their homes [ can fly ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/02/b6/02/02b602dc9a9ee8485334829776db08f8.jpg ) . 
  we 've still got catching up to do , boys !, 
  at least we still have our language being represented by our own flag . 
  then the rest would be dutch , i 'm guessing . 
  i think it could be true , but rather because of the past rather that napoleon being unable to take it . 
  the dutch had been resisting british , french and german invasions for two hundred years , and were able to have a colonial empire at the same time . 
  arguably , that 's quite impressive . 
  by the time of the rise of napoleon , the netherlands had lost its position of being a world power for over a hundred years already , and was internally collapsing due to the aged government structure and lack of innovation . 
  meanwhile , france had only become stronger , and warfare itself had changed , too . 
  , by the way . 
  oh you , we 're just kidding . 
  we [ love you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjj1jcaffcm ) and you know it !, 
  i know , i know , it was on purpose . 
  in the past the ` y ' and ` ij ' were interchangeable , but now the ` y ' is pretty much only used in borrowed words and names . 
  really , they are seperate letters these days , which is why we do n't use them as capitals .
