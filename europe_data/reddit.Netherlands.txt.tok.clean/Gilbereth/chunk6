  * / shitty old-ish dutch, 
  i think i threw up a little . . 
  i love the upside down poland !, 
  yes , though the literal translation would be more like * illness-costs-insurance * . 
  otherwise 5/7 perfect score in swamp german !, 
   which is one more reason why english is idiotic language ... of course , just leaving a/an out gets rid of the problem as well !, 
  those are not runes either , though the latter is indeed a latin version of one . 
  you guys * had * to help them with the whole `` independence thing '' , signing an alliance to defend them against us dutch folk . 
  you ca n't get away from this * that * easily . 
  they 're actually a part of france and - ...  dunno . 
  i think it 's a part of holland . 
   * think it 's a part of * holland . 
   ** holland ** :(, 
  ahh right , that makes sense . 
  i actually did think \u16b3 was a ` k ' but i think it 's upside down when compared to elder futhark , so i just made it a ? 
  instead . 
  and yeah , it 's a great boast indeed !, 
  my futhark is a bit rusty , what does it say ? 
  i could only make out [ e?umadit ] : o ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ scrub ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  make that three :(, 
  definitely !, 
  especially when it comes to the language , with the lack of the high germanic consonant shift and all that . 
  ah , my bad . 
  i should 've called it german german , which would make your proper mountain german , well , * mountain german * . 
  still , it 's no swamp german quite yet . 
  oh , i 'd love to use that name , but it 's not exactly used anymore . 
  ( `` allow us to build a bridge '' versus `` let 's build a bridge '' ) . 
  i 'm assuming the german version meant the same as the latter one . 
  exactly , hence the literal translation . 
  i think that 's what i was trying to say . . ' :d, 
  please enlighten me : what exact version of swamp german is this ? 
  * limited offer only : order now and get two languages for the price of one !, 
  ** * ^ low ^ saxon , ^ limburgish , ^ west-flemish ^ not ^ included ^ in ^ offer . 
  * cough cough 2 . 
  atlantikwall cough *, 
  yes , true . 
  but referring to the whole country as * holland * can feel like calling the uk * england * . 
  but then there 's also people who stopped caring/don ' t care and happily spread it around , annoying the aforementioned group even more , and confusing foreigners as well . 
   ~ ~ holl ~ ~ the netherlands good boy !, 
  here , have an internet cookie . 
  that accent reminded me of something north germanic at times !, 
  welcome to dutch . 
  you have passed the first class , and can now start your very first * polder !, 
  northeast and carnival ? 
  not in groningen , unless i 've been hiding in the basement for too long again . . 
  close enough !, 
  though literally translated it 'd result in * laat ons een brug bouwen * . 
  to get the same meaning however , you need to change it a little , and make it as the following sentence : * laten we een brug bouwen . 
  * kudos for trying , though !, 
  please try swamp german instead . 
  ( that 's one of the northern varieties of low saxon . 
  can you make something of it ? ), 
  and then there 's low saxon , sitting there all cozy between dutch , german , frisian and danish . 
  depending on how you want to count them , there can be 2-4 at least . 
  maybe the danes or swedes ? 
  they sure seem to enjoy shouting * danskj\u00e4vlar * and all that , maybe we can join in on the fun [ like the good ol' times ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_sound ) . 
  nothing better than a proper northern tussle !, 
  interesting , never heard of that word before . 
  but i can see the resemblance . 
  of course we also have * kapitaal * , but that has a different meaning altogether . 
  ah , like * hoofdstad * in dutch, 
  you 're welcome , 
  it seems *, 
  and what about the saxon and frisian regions in the northern netherlands/germany ? 
  to me they feel closer to denmark than anything that belgium or southern germany can offer . 
  that 's the hre , not the romans proper . 
  do n't forget greening ( groningen ), 
  so that why there 's only nordic languages and dutch on the back of the pizza boxes . 
  i thought they were preparing to ditch the eu and form a northern union instead . 
  apparently the danes have * hygge * / * hyggelig * , which has roughly the same meaning . 
  but yeah , english does n't have an equivalent . 
  there 'll be sealandic vikings raiding everything for shits and giggles as well , i reckon . 
  filthy fake-saxons !, 
  * :p seriously though , what happened in order to have another saxony spawn on the other side of the country ? 
  as long as we get our own language !, 
  if the frisians can have one then so can we !, 
   other than that : putting south sweden , denmark and schleswig holstein together with parts of lower saxony , frisia , drenthe and groningen is an interesting concept . 
  it 's basically a 5 language country . 
  well , west + east frisia , groningen , and drenthe all have a friso-saxon background , which is relatively close compared to their northern germanic partners . 
  far from being the same , yes , but it could 've been worse . 
  imagine being humped together with a * baltic * nation !, 
  ewww / s, 
  i know , but for some reason the flemish have the reputation that they beat the dutch in dutch language tests/shows . 
  well , that , and they speak funny . 
  would n't be surprised if that were the belgians , to be honest . 
  nice !, 
  dutch has * slechtstschrijvende * , which has also has seven if you choose to pronounce everything . 
  then again , you can skip half and get away with it , so i doubt many would bother . 
  hmm , i 'd agree , but we love our sea trade money too much to throw dikes in the whole thing . 
  but you are probably right . 
  we need our yearly dose of polders to stay healthy , though . 
  low saxon intensifies, 
  great choice !, 
  yet this map still calls us `` holland '' instead of * the glorious dutch republic of the seven united provinces of the netherlands * . 
  seriously , pick a few of those words and you 're good . 
  but nooooo , it * had * to be holland . 
  fine , i submit . 
  ^ ^ tsk , ^ ^ * holland * . 
  i 'd add ( northern ) netherlands and northern germany to northern europe ( frisians , saxons , etc ) , and split central europe in west - and central europe . 
  this is then based on cultural areas more than geographical .
