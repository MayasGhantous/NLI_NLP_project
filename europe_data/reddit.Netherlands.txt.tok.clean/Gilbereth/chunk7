  maybe a few minor changes , but yeah . 
  saying this as a dutchman . 
  when is n't it ? 
  the more lions the better . 
  heh , yeah i hear that a lot . 
  english just sounds like english to me because i 'm using it every day half of the time for many years and i am familiar since i was very young . 
  however , i have grown up and live in an area, 
   after tripping and falling on his own sword , henry died , leaving 3 stab wounds to the chest let me guess : he sucked so bad he failed to kill himself twice ? 
   with the most unattractive language in the world i 'm sure many dutchmen would n't mind sharing that honour with the danes . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ think ^ ^ ^ danish ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ fine ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ , 
  hah , that joke works in dutch as well . 
   the glorious revolution was an invite . 
  of course it was . 
  or luxembourgish/belgian/dutch . 
  basically , he was frankish . 
  reminds me of the whole netherlands vs holland thing . 
  less severe , especially since the history and all is different , but still the same essence . 
  generally , people in one of the holland regions do n't mind and do n't see the isdue , whereas a bunch a people in one of the other 10 provinces do n't like it . 
  yea that 's the modern one , in one of my posts i refer to the statenvlag , which is an old flag of the dutch republic and uses a lighter shade of blue , hence the earlier remark of someone . 
  it is , it 's a heraldry thing . 
  also . 
  maybe ? 
  ah , shit , ca n't check right now . 
  i 'd take it , but yeah ... nazi stuff . 
  rightwingers stuff fly it around sometimes so sadly it 's not going to happen anytime soon if ever . 
  nope . 
  our red was * darker , and they first adopted their flag in 1830 . 
  they should use [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/civil_ensign_of_luxembourg.svg/1190px-civil_ensign_of_luxembourg.svg.png ) one instead , it 's much cooler than either tricolour . 
  edit : is -  was , i 'm referring to the old statenvlag here , obviously the modern flag has a darker shade of blue than luxemburg . 
  probably . 
  there was a time where the russians thought this whole dutch republic thing was kinda cool , and they most likely liked the flag and swapped the colours a bit . 
  they were n't the only ones , hell , look at france . 
  most people probably think we stole it from them , but the dutch tricolour was * adopted * in * 1572 * . 
  the colours were n't exactly ... [ the same ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/statenvlag.svg/450px-statenvlag.svg.png ) , though . 
  uh , you are welcome , hrvatska . 
  i 'm afraid our patent ran out long ago . 
  it still has lots of seabirds and ducks !, 
  the netherlands is still a place for lots of migrating birds to feed and rest before moving . 
  but you 're right , their numbers are dropping and have dropped a lot , but luckily there are some government projects to reverse this effect . 
  not exactly , but there were some maps online that showed the state of the area in the past . 
  it was pretty much a random blob of seas , marshes , bogs , tidal seas and lakes iirc . 
  the romans referred to it as land `` that was neither land nor sea '' . 
  i 'll find a link for you , brb . 
  edit : 5500 bc , [ here you go ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:5500vc_ex_leg.jpg ) later of course it changed into something we recognise much more easily , this is from before the poldering : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:political_map_of_the_low_countries_ ( 1350 ) - nl.svg make sure to use the entire bit , reddit screws up links sometimes . 
  hmm , honestly , this map displays the lack of ireland better than any of the three on that sub . 
   ( marine fish biomass dropped by 80 % over the last century , which -- taking into consideration the growth rate of the world 's shipping fleet -- leads to an odd conclusion : sometime in the last few years , we reached a point where there are , by weight , more ships in the ocean than fish . ), 
  that 's . . disturbing . 
  well , the sentence itself is prison for life . 
  it just so happens that the living standards/prison standards are rather high in norway , so * in comparison * they are rather comfy to some of the worse places in europe . 
  i mean , what would you suggest they do ? 
  aside from stripping his room of all the unnecessary stuff , which he can probably prevent because then it 'd be discrimination , unless his sentence specifically mentions such . 
  i do n't think it works like that in most northern europe . 
  no , but you do for the other ones that did n't murder a whole island full of people and did something more human instead . 
  those prisons are n't custom made for each prisoner , so he 's got ta make do with what the standard is . 
  at this moment , that 's a prison styled for reforming prisoners . 
  i guess both apply . 
  it depends on what country you 'd compare with your own . 
  spain would be north / south , ukraine would be west / east . 
  the netherlands also sits on the corner of being both north and west , not unlike spain . 
  some algae are toxic and can in turn prevent people from swimming . 
  no need for such an aggressive remark . 
  thought so as well , but wikipedia [ insists ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/sleeswijk-holstein ) it is holstein . 
  good . 
  you help us with these m\u00fcnster pretenders , we 'll give sk\u00e5ne a try later on . 
  sound like a deal ? 
  it 's nsfnl , there 's a difference . 
  [ the average dutch * fietsenstalling * ] ( http://media.nu.nl/m/m1oxconajm5k_wd640.jpeg ) . 
   schleswig-holstein you mean sleeswijk-holstein ? 
  me too , i regained some faith in youtube comments , if only for a short while . 
  i think it 's the one right of finland , using the prince 's flag . 
  you can see the top bar being orange . 
  the dutch nazi party sometimes used that flag in wwii , i believe . 
  otherwise i would n't know . 
   pity they sound like a dane on heroin when actually talking does it make a difference ? 
  ca n't understand either one anyway as a swede , i imagine , 
  yeah , you did seem to be triggered . . ' :d hence the apology . 
  did n't intend to trigger anyone . 
  here , have some upvotes !, 
  oh definitely !, 
  there 's loads of french influence . 
  my response was more aimed at people who have the idea that english is basically french and that it contains no germanic influence , only to be suprised when they recognise words or even sentences . 
  ( they exist ) . 
  i think we 're on the same line , really . 
  i think i deserve such a response since my comparison was rather sloppy . 
  though , in my defence , i 'm writing all this on my phone . 
  :p oh , i did initially put down `` drinking water '' , but decided that since i was going for an approximation the other 'd fit better . 
  cheers !, 
  i just wanted to add some extra context to see how similar it was . 
  it was n't to be a 100 % correct , especially considering some words change their meaning over time . 
  but i guess i was wrong and should 've expected such a response . 
  my apologies . 
  not really , rather , it 's relatively easy and this example compares it to dutch . 
  it 'd be impossible to do with any non-germanic language , and gets harder the more the other language is away from dutch ( in this example ) . 
  if i 'd try with icelandic or swedish the results would be similar , yet they 're about as germanic as german itself . 
  anyway , i was writing a reply to your other comment which you removed , in which i wanted to share this [ image ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/languages_benelux.png/320px-languages_benelux.png ) . 
  the top image kind of shows the ethnic/linguistic backgrounds of the low countries regarding the franks , saxons and frisians . 
   . . en dan mogen ze vervolgens geen drinkwater gebruiken om 'm te vullen :d  . . and then may they forfollows [ no ] drinkwater [ a ] brook [ to ] him to fill :d i tried approximating it with cognates and the like , though far from correct n shit . 
  mostly germanic word replacers in english , too . 
  notable is the lack of any kind of english version of - en , which still exists in continental germanic languages in various forms . 
   translation : * and then they 're not allowed to use drinking water to fill it up :d *,
