  well , i do like my waffles ... 
  * because of your racist comments towards the dutch nation and language , you are now banned from / r/thenetherlands . 
  flemish is dutch , just a collective name for dutch dialects in belgium . 
  i am confident that when ( yes , when ) eastern europe catches up to the economies of western europe , many people who left for work will return and birth rates will recover . 
  we also `` forgot '' about our ~ 10,000 waffen-ss volunteers and 100,000 dutch nazi 's from the nsb . 
  the german empire did n't fuck up anything . 
  it was just an empire like all the others , but penalized and satanised by the entente because they fought only the germans on the western front in the great war . 
  i understand most of it , and `` grunnegs '' is n't even dutch , its low saxon . 
  only the elderly speak mainly in dialect , mass media and school have eradicated dialect usage . 
  i have never ever traveled to some place in this country where the locals spoke in `` incomprehensable gibberish '' on the street like some redditors here claim they have . 
  not sure which country they live in ... 
  i am screenshotting this , the day has come !, 
  that 's nice , hungarian sounds really cool to me . 
  if you ever want to practice speaking to somebody who wo n't speak english , send me a message . 
  are you a hungarian who learned dutch ? 
  otherwise i ca n't believe that . 
  i 've been to tilburg , breda , flanders , drenthe and have never ever had trouble speaking to and understanding people . 
  i am from the leiden area myself . 
  macedonia is glorious bulgar !, 
  ek begrij da niks von = totally incomprehensible dialect, 
  the surname sounds like he is of german descent , pretty interesting . 
  muh feels , i do n't even ... 
  bulgaria no :( maybe you will get a good anti-corruption system , gypsies move to sweden and the uk , turks go to turkey . 
  never give up !, 
  sunny weather and doner kebab , always +1 :d, 
  if they ca n't tolerate a turkish lgbt walk in turkey ( neither does akp but hey ) they should get over themselves or go away . 
  we actually got 150,000 . 
  i know you have way more , but turkey is geographically and culturally way closer than europe is . 
  i would prefer the refugees to be in a safe and familiar country , like jordan or saudi arabia . 
  maybe because they know you guys wo n't tolerate being messed with . 
  what ever is decided , it will remain a political decision ( a language is a dialect with an army and a navy ) . 
  if ukrainians however have two alphabets like the serbs , they might start looking more towards poland instead of russia . 
  learning english will also be much easier i suppose . 
  that looks really cool and very `` european '' . 
  are there any talks about switching alphabets now that ukraine is moving to the west and ( according to polls ) hating russia ? 
  topkek, 
  there is no point in talking about them 10 centuries ago , we have problems today . 
  in many islamic countries women ca n't go to school , drive a car , go outside without being completely covered or without a male family member , get a job etc. 
  if you really think this is all to protect them from the horrible men you are quite naive . 
  do n't forget women are the ones being jailed or murdered when they get raped for family honour , where is the protection here ? 
  this is not what it looks like , since islam is about tolerance and equality . . right ? 
  yes , can you find somalia , afghanistan and mali on the map ? 
  if they were `` rich '' before , usually no . 
  look at russia and poland . 
  third world countries with extremist islam issues pump out 6 kids . 
  world will be nice . 
  topkek . 
  is n't belarusian a seperate language ? 
  if you do n't think so , what would that make ukrainian , which russians do n't seem to understand much . 
  that 's what i noticed too . 
  in 1500 it sounded pretty much the same as it did now , in 1000 it sounded way more danish or norwegian . 
  let 's see if they get a new car and house when they do , 
  im atheist and agree with the pope , now what ? 
  not pro-gay child adoption = homophobia . 
  realism, 
  okay , so you 're a hippie ? 
  you do n't need to ask the question in dutch , english is fine since it 's about ** manners ** . 
  non-native english speakers do n't take it for granted and do n't rely on others , unlike natives who usually do n't know any other language and rely on others learning their language to get around . 
  so , to show ** manners ** and not appear arrogant just ask `` do you speak english '' in english . 
  you still do n't get it do you ? 
  imagine dutch is the international lingua franca . 
  pretty much everybody speaks some basic dutch , some speak it near native and some poorly or even barely at all . 
  now i am going on vacation to england . 
  i walk into a pub and say `` een bier alstublieft '' . 
  do you think this would be good , since everybody knows dutch ? 
  england is still a non-dutch country so if i had ** manners ** i 'd ask the person if he speaks dutch . 
  lol , there is now racism against anglophones ? 
  english speakers are a race now ? 
  this is getting better and better . 
  communists also want equality for all , are you a communist ? 
  well ... you [ decide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bca8fcctmsq ), 
  yes that 's correct , but because of english those words come quicker to the mind of journalists and politicians and thus they are starting to get more common than our own native words . 
  but you wanting to understand me , is that my responsibility or yours ? 
  what happend to our :  yeah but the problem here is , you do n't get to decide who is a neo-nazi and who is n't . 
  i am not a neo-nazi , i am a patriot and conservative but in your little echo chamber that must totally be a nazi . 
  it 's not about my opinion above here , for you it 's about my ideology or according to you , my `` shit '' . 
  if it was purely about the above opinion , you would n't have to give anything to `` help them decide '' . 
  the difference between us is , you seem insecure about your own opinion so you try to turn people against alternative opinions . 
  there is no calling me out on my shit , since i have a perfectly legal opinion and have free speech just like everybody else . 
  yeah but the problem here is , you do n't get to decide who is a neo-nazi and who is n't . 
  cry me a river . 
  the only reason you try to portray me as a nazi is because i do n't fit your political narrative and you want to set up a circlejerk against me . 
  but have fun kid . 
  mhm yes . 
  i should value the economic opportunists just like they value human value , like that time they threw christian refugees off one of their boats ... oh wait . 
  zucht ... once again i shall repeat , this is not an english country so you ca n't assume everybody speaks english . 
  even if we all do , show some respect and ask `` excuse me do you speak english ? '' . 
  that 's how simple manners are . 
  there is no butthurt or jealousy , just your rudeness . 
  well to be blunt but honest , their lives have no value to us . 
  they have no education , no skills , do n't speak the language or know the culture . 
  imagine me coming to britain and asking questions in dutch . 
  it does n't matter if english is the lingua franca , it still does n't force anybody to speak it and the fact that most do should be a service and not something that should be taken for granted . 
  good luck with your lingua franca and arrogancy in places like china or russia . 
  if a german or french would speak to me in their language it would be weird and rude but not arrogant , they do n't have an attitude of `` i speak english and so should everybody else '' americans and many brits have . 
  how hard can a polite and respectful `` excuse me do you speak english '' be ? 
  and if you are really awesome and want to make some smiling faces , pick up a tourist booklet for the netherlands and look up some useful phrases . 
  how close are the scandinavian languages with zero training and knowledge about the others ? 
  can you speak to eachother by default , need to speak slowly and clearly or do you need some practice ? 
  no , pretty much everyone here speaks english to some extent but that 's not the point .
