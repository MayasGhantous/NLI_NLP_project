swamp german best fake german confirmed . 
  it 's not hard to get a lot of things done if you have no regard for the people it affects . 
  why should we not include the victims when judging his actions ? 
  frankly with all the resources russia has available it could have easily been as prosperous as the united states if it were managed by better leaders over the years . 
  wo n't happen for the netherlands . 
  we wo n't have a new government before that deadline :d, 
  i 've never seen a street like that before but yeah that would be for parking . 
  i bet that street is packed with parked cars at night . 
  hmm , more space for polders . 
  i like this map . 
  my favourite bot . 
  fascinating !, 
  well . . to be fair a lot of people do n't have a good understanding of what being transgender is either . 
   as usual with these european polls , it makes me wonder if there 's som hidden connotations related to the language used for asking the question . 
  i think it 's a poorly phrased question to begin with . 
  a better version would be : '' * would you prefer a cisgender leader over a transgender leader ? 
  * '' [ ] * yes * [ ] * does n't matter *, 
  yes that 's what it usually refers to : * a person that desires to or has changed their sex * . 
  which happens to apply to most transgender people . 
  i would argue that such a child does n't actually skip the social , intellectual and moral aspects of those developments at all , even if they do experience them differently from most of their peers . 
  i 'm more than slightly uncomfortable with the idea of letting children suffer through puberty of the gender that is n't theirs when we have the available expertise to help them - safely . 
  just fyi that does n't mean surgery for kids , that would be irresponsible . 
  and why is that ? 
  you 'd rather see boys grow boobs which they will bind anyways and will probably only make the surgery they want to have later in life harder ? 
  you 'd prefer girls that are afraid to talk because they got a lower voice and that want ( and sometimes try ) to cut off their penis ? 
  all hormone blockers do is delay puberty from happening so these kids have a longer time to develop mentally and can decide to take the hormones of the gender they are transitioning to later on . 
  i 'm sure different countries have different guidelines but i believe they tend to start taking hormones at around age 15 . 
  there are no rash decisions in the proces . 
  they are n't kids going through some phase they will grow out of . 
  they wo n't get hormone blockers if it 's not very clear that they really want to go through with it and realise what it means . 
  edit : looked up the guidelines for the netherlands . 
  hormone blockers from age 12 , hormones from age 16 . 
  surgery from age 18 . 
  transsexuals are by definition transgender . 
  transgender is the umbrella term that also includes things like agender and bigender . 
  transsexual is actually a pretty shitty term to use since it has nothing to do with sexuality . 
  edit : the use of non gendered pronouns like `` they '' is usually preferred by people who do n't really fall into 1 of the main 2 genders . 
  but they are a minority even within the transgender community . 
  in the [ corresponding thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/60pduw/how_comfortable_would_people_in_the_eu_be_with/ ) on mapporn the op said this :  percentage who responded 7-10 on a scale where 10 is ` totally comfortable ' and 1 ` not comfortable at all ' in response to the question :  ` how would you feel about having a person from each of the following groups in the highest elected political position in [ country ] '  a transgender or transsexual person . 
   based on the eurobarometer report ` discrimination in the eu in ' 2015 ' , which can be found here : http://www.equineteurope.org/img/pdf/ebs_437_en.pdf, 
  a few things that are holding back transgender acceptance : * transgenders that we see in the media and notice in every day life often still have obvious traces of their original gender which makes them stand out and feel ` unnatural ' . 
  the new generations of transgenders can usually transition so well that you will never find out that they were born in a body of another gender ( especially when they start hormone blockers and stuff at the beginning of puberty ) . 
  * there are very few to none public figures that are known to be transgender so a lot of people will never know any and ca n't get used to them . 
  * very poor education about transgender issues ( this applies even to progressive countries like my own ) . 
  for example a lot of people do n't know the difference between dragqueens and transgenders . 
  a lot of people think transgenders are gay when it has nothing to do with sexuality . 
  people also think that transgenders are doing it for attention . 
  could n't be more wrong ; transgender youth have even higher suicide rates than gays . 
  genderdysphoria is no joke , it can lead to very severe depression . 
  transitioning is a very complicated and hard proces that takes ** years ** . 
  i think it 's very interesting , have n't seen stats specificly about transgenders before . 
  the only acceptable time to use holland is when cheering for our national football team !, 
  you 're never going to be accepted if you call us holland instead of netherlands . 
  the road really ruins the picture for me . 
  why would regional differences make the data irrelevant ? 
  i 'm sure most countries have those differences . 
  urban vs rural , old vs young etc. 
  netherlands has a biblebelt , should we exclude it to make the data ` more relevant ' ? 
  people the commentary is satire ( turn on subtitles ) . 
  this game is from 2015 . 
  this video was made by the same show that made the america first netherlands second video . 
  also , holy shit i forgot how bad our football team is nowadays . 
  losing 3-0 to turkey smh . . 
  they will be talking about trade , security , russia , isis and refugees . 
  will be interesting to see what the relations between germany and us are like after some of the negative remarks made by trump and members of his government and also disapproving comments made by german officials before trump was elected . 
  worth it . 
  he 's too competent to be vvd though :p no scandals . 
  yes they won there last time too . 
  limburg traditionally has lots of pvv voters . 
  kerkrade ( municipality in limburg ) : pvv 28,9 % sp 19,3 % vvd 12,8 % cda 11 % d66 6,4 % gl 5,3 %, 
  do n't forget to mention that denk has gotten 7,5 % which is very significant . 
  amsterdam has been counted and gl won there . 
  they do n't hold a majority , they will have 69 seats and need 76 . 
  closer to 13 % actually . 
  tied 2nd place with d66 and cda , the black bars and numbers display the result . 
  me too thanks, 
  i just wanted to ask everyone , fellow europeans and outsiders alike to stop agenda pushing in this thread . 
  we do n't need your advice on who to vote for . 
  these elections are about much more than what the english language media portrays them to be . 
  this is n't some fight against populism or against islam . 
  we are a democratic country . 
  after the elections our parties will attempt to form a coalition government that represents what we have voted for . 
  that 's how democracy works . 
  regardless of whether you are going to like the result or not , it will be fair . 
  as long as people go out to vote for what they believe in . 
  luckily we are expecting about 80 % attendance so its going well . 
  you could authorise someone else to vote for you in that instance though . 
   ** far ** left wing saying there are no problems . 
  ftfy . 
  yes , and we also have the most advanced xtc labs too !, 
  it caters perfectly to the edm pop trend that started around 2010 . 
  pretty basic , upbeat and good for radio stations . 
  i 'm not a fan of him either and i 'm quite into electronic music . 
  [ almost 1 billion views ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcychz2k5x0 ), 
  i think it really depends on the extent of his fear . 
  i do n't know geert wilders well enough personally to make a judgement of that . 
  i doubt paul wilders really does either at this point , since they have n't had a good relationship for many years . 
  should he fear an attack/assassination by muslim extremists ? 
  for sure . 
  hell i reckon without security he would 've probably been dead today .
