  really ? 
  this looks so wrong to me , like 2 flags stitched together with an ugly border around it . 
  i have no idea who would upvote this abomination . 
  how come ? 
  i love reading a newspaper in the morning . 
  my breakfast is incomplete without it . 
  to me that sounds a lot like the argument people used against playing violent videogames , that it would desensitize them and encourage violent behaviour in real life . 
  i would assume sexual frustration is the reason that some pedos do end up crossing the line and sexually abuse a child . 
  if anything a doll would help release that frustration to some extent . 
  same with stuff like loli which i think is also illegal in a lot of places . 
  well they 're not wrong , being a music instrument sounds like a pretty bad life and you can easily become a terrorist by tweeting something mean to erdogan so ... ^ ^ / s, 
  that said the whole it 's natural therefore it should be normal argument makes no sense to begin with . 
  rape is natural , cannibalism is natural , murder is natural and so on . 
  i 'm a lgbt person myself but i always try to discourage people from using the `` it 's natural '' argument when advocating for lgbt issues . 
  lol this sub was never exclusively serious content . . 
  that was hilarious !, 
  dutch people love cycling , it is one of our main ways of transport . 
  [ to give you an idea ] ( https://idonotdespair.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/sea-of-bikes-utrecht.jpg ) . 
  that 's at a train station . 
  it 's not even the only bike parking at that station . 
  there is also an old joke between dutch and germans of asking to give our stolen bicycles back . 
  during ww2 many bicycles were stolen by the germans , especially in the last days of wars when they had to retreat . 
  so naturally hanging bicycles is a declaration of war . 
  it would though . . queen elizabeth overthrowing the british government and naming herself god emperor of the world is more likely to happen than this . 
  trump getting elected for a 2nd term is also more likely . 
  the only country that we have a closer bond with , both politically and culturally is belgium . 
  the funniest thing is the people that initially believed the title of your post lol . 
  germany !, 
  i thought we were brothers ?!, 
  how could you . . 
  a bike is n't meant to go fast . . just needs to help you get from point a to b without getting sweaty in summer . 
  also needs to last through years of every day use in all weather conditions . 
  north-holland and south-holland together are the ugliest of all dutch province flags lol . 
  mods do n't remove posts for `` having different opinions '' . 
  [ small album ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/babsb ) of the wadden sea . 
  the dutch province of north brabant has a bit of a problem with drug crime . 
  the main issues are cannibis farms and xtc labs . 
  the police discovers new labs pretty much weekly . 
  research of sewage water shows us every year that the eindhoven region is a hotspot for dumping chemicals used to make xtc . 
  a lot of chemical waste also gets dumped along forests in the countryside . 
  it 's very toxic waste . 
  most labs are found in the countryside too , usually in barns or sheds . 
  1 out of 8 farmers in north brabant has been approached by criminals to use their property for drug production . 
   the argument that one needs religion for morality is a baseless fallacy it 's not what i said . 
  i am atheist myself and i `` sin '' a lot less than your average christian probably does but the point is for some people having an extra reason helps them . 
  hence it being moral guidance , not morality itself . 
  there are a lot of christian charity organisations and holidays like christmas remind people that they should think of others some more . 
  the same applies to ramadan in islam . 
   the view that people pick out only the pretty things is very naive . 
  that 's the point i was making . 
  i 'm fully aware this is not what people tend to do which is why i said people are sheep and that they will take the easy route of following what someone else says . 
  i did n't say that people pick out pretty things , i said it was up to them to do so . 
  as in : it is their duty to start doing so to let religion evolve . 
  after all as you said religions are merely a collection of old stories and moral guidelines of a different time that are not up to date . 
   the real question is if you can really change something that is considered the literal word of god and any deviation from is considered heresy . 
  i believe that it is possible for there to be a revolution within the main religions just as we have already experienced numerous times in the past . 
  it would require a strong movement and it will take a long time to be accepted worldwide . 
  it will be harder for islam than christianity because that religion is rooted in the middle east and no change can start from there in my opinion . 
   religion is the antithesis to modern society . 
  im afraid that you are the one being naive here now . 
  religion is already very much part of modern society because that 's what we 're living in . 
  the share of religious people compared to atheists will only continue to grow as the populations in africa and asia grow much faster than the western ones . 
  we have to live with religion in modern society and give it a place instead of trying to fight it . 
  that does n't mean we should not fight backward ideas that accompany those religions but rather that we should help religions transition . 
  but what if erdogan is shitposting here on / r/europe ? 
  if we call him a poopypants it would simultaneously be a personal attack on him as a reddit user and as a politician ? 
   [ but if you think they are stupid meanie mc poopiepants , you can say so freely , gay or not . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6keeos/the_german_parliament_just_approved_a_law_opening/djlnct4/ )  calling each other poopy mc dirtypants will get you slightly banned , but banned nonetheless . 
  make up your mind mr. mc poopypants !, 
  also stop being so active , it took me like 10 minutes to find that comment in your profile ... 
  in this case the concept appears to originate from [ france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wildlife_crossing#history_and_location ), 
  probably because in north brabant we have a [ clusterfuck of small forests ] ( http://www.clo.nl/sites/default/files/styles/clo_infographic/public/infographics/0061_005k_clo_10_nl.png?itok=yr2vf6yo ) seperated by a lot of small towns , roads and farm areas . 
  i do n't agree . 
  people being sheep and not thinking for theirselves is the problem . 
  religion can have many positives to it and give people a type of moral guidance that they otherwise would n't have . 
  it is up to each individual to pick out the things they believe are important and fit well in modern society . 
  it is however much easier to just stick with what you have always been told to believe and to act the same as the people closest to you . 
  religion is a human made thing so it can easily be changed to go along with the times . 
  it is human unwillingness to do so that has prevented many of the needed changes from happening . 
  please also check out gay rights in excellent christian countries such as botswana and congo and get back to us . 
  oh my , would n't want to live next to a christian amirite ? 
  ah yes because muslims in a war torn country with on average much lower education and very different cultural standards surrounding them are completely comparable to muslims born and raised in a modern western countries surrounded by people that are generally accepting of homosexuality . 
  well it is the independent after all . . 
  i make a point out of not clicking on their article links . 
  absolute garbage journalism there . 
  i also found [ this collection ] ( http://www.collectiontrade.nl/cms/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=1457&amp;itemid=35 ) of dutch mailboxes from different time periods . 
  the website loads a bit slowly but there are some pretty cool photos in there !, 
  my favourite is probably [ this one specificly for tax returns ] ( http://www.collectiontrade.nl/cms/images/stories/prod2/brn-0130-01.jpg ), 
  the plaque above the mailbox says an organisation in maassluis borrowed this mailbox from the ptt ( old state company for post , telegraph and telephone ) to remember the first mailbox placed in the town of maassluis back in 1881 . 
  this is n't that original mailbox but actually an older one but it does n't say where it is originally from . 
  mailboxes you say ? 
  has that one been done ? 
  that would be an excellent idea ... 
  it reminds me of a house that a 5 year old might build in minecraft , using the same materials for the floor , wall and ceiling . 
  oh that explains it , they probably designed it to make fun of ugly belgian houses . 
  classic banter , and you guys fell for it too !, 
  lol who the fuck came up with the design of the german-speaking one ... 
  it feels a bit small , how many people are in your parliament ? 
  edit : i think it 's because of the shape , i guess there are quite a few seats actually .
