  we had a wolf from germany here for a while until it got hit by car or something . 
  and king of poland, 
  ah okay , that 's what i thought . 
  i suppose you would call them educational trails . 
  i actually think those kind of people are a lot more common in the us ( eg the buzzfeed crowd ) . 
  we do n't usually take things to the extremes like they do there . 
  i sure as hell have n't met any of those people here . 
  the only thing that i see on a small scale is some people calling everything racism . 
  doing that gets them a lot of backlash though . 
   ` learning paths ' what makes them different from normal paths ? 
  haha there are many beautiful things to see in iceland but i probably wo n't go there to visit a forest :p, 
   around javornik and sne\u017enik , you 'll find forests like this with european hop-hornbeam , turkey oak and durmast oak . 
  wow !, 
  i would love to do some hiking there , looks really cool . 
  do forests typically have well marked trails ? 
  when i was in australia i noticed the trails were really well marked , but even when they were n't you could not really go into any other direction . 
  so it was easy to find the right way . 
  in comparison the dutch forests usually have lots and lots of intersecting trails and most of them have some marked routes . 
  if they do n't have marked routes , its easy to get lost because you can go into many directions . 
  at the same time it 's impossible to get lost due to the small size of dutch forests though . 
  haha me every time when i see something for just one second . 
  `` i want to believe '', 
  guys do n't bother replying , [ / u/neezypetersen ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/neezypetersen ) is either a troll or completely delusional . 
  his comment history is full of ridiculous statements essentially hating on americans just for the sake of hating on them . 
  cool , did you ever see a wildcat ? 
  i bet those are pretty good at staying out of sight . 
  me too thanks, 
  [ 1 ] ( http://static.zoom.nl/df4c54eb7bf981183c71148ec3794dab-oisterwijkse-bossen-en-vennen.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/domsvyvq860/maxresdefault.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.bestemminginbeeld.nl/mediabank/2008/10/22/cda9d/max.jpg ) most common trees are english oak ( called summer oak in dutch ) , european beech , scots pine , dwarf birch and white willow ( usually not in forests but near water ) the northern red oak ( called american oak here ) is also pretty common and originates from northern america . 
  in some places it 's possible to see [ red deer ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/5a/dd/54/5add541b2a43e5ea0122a2ad132ce003.jpg ) which is really cool . 
  i never see those though , usually only some [ roe deer ] ( http://www.reeenopvangwesterwolde.nl/ree%203-art.jpg ) . 
  back in 1750 the netherlands only had 2 % of its land covered by forest . 
  medieval construction and such took its toll . 
  since that time we have been improving . 
  nowadays it 's closer to 11 % and still going up slowly . 
  well historically the [ golden age of the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_golden_age ) was during the 17th century . 
  however i 'm more inclined to say the golden era is taking place now . 
  we might no longer have a global empire , but quality of life is better than ever and still improving . 
  sure , some things were better in other times and there will always be old people complaining `` back in my day x was much better '' . 
  i like to live in the present though and i 'm pretty content . 
  i think the netherlands is one of best countries to be born and raised in even if it 's far from perfect . 
   sexual immorality jesus dude do you live in the damn stone age ? 
  you do n't have to be married to have kids . 
  in fact there are plenty of countries where getting married does n't have any advantages at all . 
  with the amount of divorces going on and people losing large amounts of their posessions due to court rulings i can understand why some people would prefer not to get married at all . 
  you can be a perfectly good couple as parents without being married ... 
  i 'm going to leave a somewhat skeptical reply . 
  okay so from first glance your idea sounds pretty nice , original and fun . 
  i 've had a long time interest for other countries around the world so as a kid i would have loved a gift like this myself . 
  certainly would n't describe it as lazy . 
  however , there are some negative sides to this idea : * you are asking strangers on the internet to give their location ( and probably their picture ) * we do n't know anything about you : your age , location , what you look like it 's not just that though . 
  the thing is , this subreddit has recently received a few threads from guys asking to do almost the same thing for their girlfriend , as a valentines day gift . 
  i 've also seen threads like that on / r/europe and some other place . 
  this could mean 2 things : * there is a new trend going on ( which would just be annoying and should be stopped ) * people are collecting personal information with ill intent ( impersonation , defamation , etc ) now , i 'm a pretty chilled person and i do n't automatically assume the worst of people . 
  i 'm going to say you meant well and that you just see this as what it sounds like , a fun idea . 
  but you have to understand that 's not how the internet works . 
  cyber crime is a very real thing that will only grow bigger over the next decades . 
  anyways , i personally value my privacy somewhat so i wo n't help you with your little project . 
  nonetheless i wish you the best of luck with it . 
  yes i agree . 
  i read the volkskrant daily and it 's one of the best quality newspapers we have but it certainly does show left wing bias at times . 
   they have a president that can do anything he wants and americans ca n't stop him because he can just fire and elect people that will agree with him , essentially getting rid of democracy . 
  he ignores the us constitution and nothing happens to him . 
  this is simply not true though . 
  it 's the united states we 're talking about , not turkey . 
  i have full faith that trump will do something so outrageous that impeachment is the only option . 
  most republicans in the senate might be spineless old men but i 'm sure even their patience will run thin eventually . 
  hello `` dumb '' american . 
  you can safely ask a question here without calling yourself dumb , do n't worry . 
  i would be against it mostly because of financial reasons . 
  the amount of security that has to come with an american president visiting is outrageous . 
  a few years ago obama visited for ** 3 hours ** and it cost about 360 thousand euros . 
  a visit from trump would cost even more because he has a lot more enemies than obama . 
  on top of that a visit from trump would cause lots of protests and in general it will probably have a negative light in the media . 
  so not very helpful for tourism and business . 
  i ca n't look into the future but if trump continues to make decisions that go against the values that my country stands for , i would support canceling any planned state visits . 
  however i would emphasize that it 's his actions that matter , not his ridiculous statements in media and on twitter . 
   it 's like not allowing your teenage son to stay over at his girlfriend 's house . 
  if they want to have sex , the will find a way . 
  it 's more like not allowing your teenage son 's girlfriend to stay over at your house ** and ** also not allowing all of his friends , classmates and any random kid his age you do n't even know . 
  all that to prevent your kid from having sex . 
  hahahaha omg the dutch one . 
  i remember when that was a thing . 
   yasmin levy - la alegria i guess it 's in spanish ? 
  when i saw alegria i was expecting [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmrnsfwtxjq ), 
  yep of course those are worse , but not in my region , 
  i found out yesterday there 's a german version of it o_o, 
  yep one of my favs  it was really big here . 
  did stromae 's tracks ever reach the american charts though ? 
  i would look into flying from barcelona to paris . 
  ryanair will probably have great deals . 
  from paris to brussels and then amsterdam go by train . 
  you can use the [ thalys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thalys ) for that . 
  til . 
  i 'm sure there 's spanish artists doing the exact same thing though . 
  in general summer hits are pretty basic and we tend to associate spanish language with that summer feeling . 
  well those songs were perfectly appropriate for the time though . 
  late 90s and early 2000s just had lots of weird songs . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj-cmhzrkhu ) was a hit only a few years ago , i love it but it 's definitely not top quality music ;-), 
  those years are n't over yet my friend . 
  every summer a couple new ones come out and conquer the charts across europe ,
