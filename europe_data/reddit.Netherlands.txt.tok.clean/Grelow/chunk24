  you might enjoy [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp04jkgzlp4 ) old song . 
  the videoclip is amazing too !, 
  i 'm going to edit this post later with some more songs , i have a cd with songs from africa somewhere that i have to find . 
  edit : found it , i 'll just link the [ playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34ltkqtjwu&amp;list=pl1260e91df2b8d6a4 ), 
  wow that was pretty awesome !, 
  wow 289m views on youtube how do i not know of this song . . ?? 
  i guess it was not a hit in australia cause i was there when it came out . 
  when it comes to sci fi i do n't really care that much . 
  i like a pretty wide range of options . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of universes with tons of non human species ( like starwars and startrek i guess ) . 
  something post apocalyptic is usually cool . 
  i prefer robots over aliens . 
  some sci fi series/books/games i like : ** enders game ** book series ** stranger things ** tv series ** hunger games ** books/movies ** portal ** games with fantasy i also prefer if most species are humans or at least humanoid . 
  i do n't like for wizards and stuff to have too much power . 
  timetravel is a big no no for me . 
  i like the following series/books/games : ** lord of the rings ** ( best fantasy universe of all time , hands down ) ** game of thrones ** ( i 'm obsessed with the books , stopped watching the tv show some time in season 3 because it went in the wrong direction ) ** runescape ** ** deltora ** book series ( i loved these as a kid , do n't think they hold up for adults though ), 
  it 's a lot more interesting than brexit threads . 
  my favourite is probably [ papaoutai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oikj0z_xnjc ) by stromae . 
  another of my favourites is [ haus am see ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmqiuaj92tm ) by peter fox . 
  yea it 's pretty amazing , i can * almost * see the sea from here !, 
  my town has an area that is maybe 2-3 meters lower than my neighbourhood . 
  it 's such a challenge to ride my bicycle up and down / s edit : to add to the fun , if all of the netherlands that is below sea-level floods , i will have a beach really nearby !, 
  that would be great . 
  most of that area was far above sea-level though ( far = more than 10m :d ) edit : my town is 6m above sea level, 
  the meuse , waal and rhine floodings of 1995 . 
  i think no one died but it caused one of the largest evacuations in dutch history . 
  the most important highway of the country was flooded and there are some [ iconic images ] ( http://i1315.photobucket.com/albums/t595/wgsverstoep/47a34vl_zps1f231cde.png ) of [ that event ] ( https://www.bhic.nl/media/pagemedia/image/lijden-1995-a2-7.jpg ) . 
  maybe in extreme cases where leaving the embassy would result in life threatening danger ? 
  well in highschool foreign language teachers are usually native dutch . 
  i did have a french teacher from france but his dutch was good . 
  the one time i had an english teacher that could n't speak dutch ( she was from czechia ) it was very inconvenient and resulted in bad grades for the whole class . 
  it should also be noted that we tend to focus on british english rather than american english . 
  sorry for adding another reply but i wanted to add that you should definitely try some local foods . 
  on the markets try raw herring ( haring ) , old amsterdam ( cheese ) , stroopwafels , and a croquette or frikandel on a bun . 
  also try some liqourice ( drop ) if you like that , we have many different kinds . 
  i quite like [ this museum ] ( https://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl/ ) in amsterdam . 
  it 's a maritime museum , we have an interesting history of exploration . 
  other popular options would be the [ rijksmuseum ] ( https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en ) where the famous night watch painting can be found and of course the anne frank house . 
  if you are staying in amsterdam for more than a day i would recommend visiting utrecht or maybe rotterdam as well . 
  the train connections to those cities are extremely good and you can get there in < 1 hour . 
  rotterdam is very different from amsterdam because its old city center got bombed to hell by the germans . 
  there 's a lot of interesting modern buildings there now . 
  utrecht is more similar to amsterdam but far less crowded . 
  well it depends on your definition of fun . 
  i would personally go and visit a number of museums and walk around the historical centres of both cities . 
  basically just see and experience things that you ca n't really do in your own country . 
  both cities definitely offer a lot of options for partying as well . 
  you can do what all the british chavs do in amsterdam and visit the red light district and smoke weed , do shrooms or whatever . 
  not really things i would waste my time on lol . 
  ja ( that 's yes in like 10 languages ) si oui tak, 
  what time do you live in ? 
  lol, 
  most of germany 's neighbours love germany too though . 
  it 's been like 10 years now but i think de lama 's was a really great improv comedy show . 
  yea well i love traveling so i will simply have to keep pushing my boundaries . 
  if i did n't do that i would spend my days sitting inside my own home not meeting anyone my whole life . 
  last year i traveled around australia on my own for 6 months . 
  there were so many things completely new to me on that journey and i did n't really have anyone to fall back on most of the way . 
  being autistic i knew i was going to have to go beyond my limits and was going to experience fear on the way . 
  i did n't let it stop me which in the end lead to the greatest experience of my lifetime . 
  if someone comes to my country only for a holiday and wants to order something in a restaurant , and they butcher the pronounciation so badly that i ca n't even understand what they are saying . 
  why would i want them to continue trying dutch , when we could 've started off in english much more easily and had a normal conversation to begin with ? 
  it 's not just france anyways . 
  it would be much more convenient if people could speak english as 2nd language everywhere . 
  if i ca n't make myself understood in another language it gives me severe anxiety and basically ruins my day . 
  i have memories like that still haunting me . 
  not effective at all imo . 
  anyone remember [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkpdk3jxlay ) french gem from the 90s ? 
  damn almost every single one of these songs have used autotune . . 
  i do n't keep up  still ronnie flex , lil kleine and mr polska most popular ? 
  [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtkrehr3igi ) [ are ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqlhazzc2xa ) [ also ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je8gqvhp0cw ) [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnlam8ejw1e ) [ pretty much sums up the dutch hiphop/electronic pop scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnmxskfwflq ), 
  this might be just me but i 'm at the point where i chat more comfortably in english than dutch . 
  i 'm in the catholic south but have n't heard of this before . 
  went to a catholic school and all . 
  guess i missed out . 
  i do n't like wearing my shoes inside , but guests usually keep their shoes on . 
  yes , although not much more other than `` most of the royal family was hiding in canada '' . 
  except for queen wilhemina , who stayed in london . 
  she was famous for her speeches on an illegal radio station while the germans occupied netherlands . 
  she encouraged resistance and said not to cooperate with the germans . 
  surely those that want to defend europe , especially on european soil , would want to do that out of love for their own country and eu ? 
  not for the money . 
  you 're talking about an actual war situation right ? 
  not about training exercises . 
  i should 've been more clear . 
  in history classes that i took throughout highschool the only mentioned involvement of canada was in ' 44 . 
  my point being , i did learn plenty of history , just hardly any about canada 's involvement . 
  alright , i 'll admit i was wrong about canada 's involvement in ww2 . 
  does n't mean you have to keep using this rude tone to me though . 
  i did learn quite a bit of history and canada was only mentioned as liberator in the late 1944-45s . 
  so that 's my excuse , take it or leave it . 
  i have no beef with canada as you could 've easily read from my posts , so you can calm down . 
  that does n't mean i want to be in any military alliance with them . 
  there are plenty of other countries that the netherlands has excellent relations with but there 's no way in hell i would go to fight there either . 
   i do n't like the us acting as world police me neither , and that 's why i want out of nato . 
  it 's just an organisation for the usa to extend their power . 
  their only motive for letting the baltic states , romania and bulgaria in nato is so they have that power closer to russia . 
  no one in the us will shed a tear if estonia gets attacked by russia . 
  those countries are just a buffer zone between the west and russia . 
  what us does n't want is for russia to extend its power so they wo n't let the baltic states get attacked , but that 's the only reason .
