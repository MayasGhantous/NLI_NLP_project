  but if they do want to leave i do n't see why the uk would need to prevent them from doing so . 
  more likely candidates for independence here would be friesland or limburg . 
  if they had a majority population supporting independence i would n't exactly mind if they did . 
  it would be their choice - i 've never fully understood why countries insist that parts of their country with a strong identity seperating them from the rest of the country should stick together against their will . 
  it seems to me that it 's purely for economical reasons . 
  regardless of that it 's not exactly unique that third party nations get involved in these kind of affairs . 
  the serbia kosovo issue comes to mind , crimea and countless others . 
  anyways it 's not like anyone in a position of power here is rallying for scottish independence . 
  i 'd never heard of this guy before , doubt anyone has . 
  i get the impression that it 's mostly going to be scots that are living in netherlands and germany at this march anyways , with a bunch of them visiting to add to the numbers . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  it was a pretty good photoshop . 
  people that do n't see these kind of altered images on a daily basis can easily assume that it 's a real picture . 
  sure within a minute of research you can find out that it did n't actually happen but tons of people do n't do that kind of research . 
  you may think it 's funny but it was clearly not intended as a joke . 
  it was done to make pechtold look bad which at best is simply a low blow but at worst is propaganda that reminds me a lot of what we see in north korea or russia . 
  if the pvv had a leader that did n't resolve to personal attacks and statements that can easily be considered racism then it could be a respectable party . 
  it would be useful in representing a view that many people in our country share . 
  right now it is the cancer of our political system . 
  if this sort of rhetoric is really where we are heading as a society with people like trump gaining massive popularity despite their complete lack of respect for anyone or anything , that makes me very sad . 
  [ the picture tweeted by wilders , original on the right side ] ( https://nos.nl/data/image/2017/02/06/351629/864x486.jpg ) . 
  it was taken at a demonstration in london in 2009 against wilders who was there to speak . 
  in his tweet there was no clear indication that the photo was altered to put pechtold in there . 
  leading to the possibility of his many followers believing that this picture is real and that pechtold supports terrorists/islamist extremists . 
  this sort of deliberate spreading of misinformation should honestly be illegal , especially when done by figures of authority such as wilders . 
  it 's a threat to our democracy . 
  honestly you guys deserve some of that sweet soros money . 
  if only !, 
  that 's really impressive . 
  the dutch news broadcast 30 minutes ago said it was only 100k in bucharest . 
  except scotland does also have its own government and its own police force . 
  the uk government is just one step higher up . 
  same way the eu has a government which is higher up from national governments . 
  again , this does n't make the eu any less secure if information between different police forces is exchanged properly . 
  if anything you should be complaining about your own border security failing if criminals do get in . 
  the uk has a much easier border to defend due to the limited ways of getting in . 
  you have to go through immigration at the airport even when coming from another eu country , unlike when flying in between the continental eu members . 
  same way a wanted man from scotland would go to england . 
  but i do n't see you complaining about that . 
  what 's wrong with police authorities from multiple countries cooperating and exchanging information , same as they do within a country on a smaller scale ? 
  by your logic any big country is automatically more insecure than a smaller country because a criminal has more space to move around . 
  have an upvote . 
  regardless of your political stance i think this is quite funny . 
  edit : to clarify the mainly american stereotype about sweden being overrun by islamists is so exeggerated to the point where its funny . 
  whether this poster meant it as a joke or not , the way he portrayed it gave me a chuckle . 
  you people need to stop taking everything so serious . 
  i really have to visit turkey some time . 
  for the cats . . and historic buildings . 
  can i join ? 
  [ `` he ( the pm ) also said that the justice ministry and justice minister florin iordache would take responsibility for the poor communication and confusions related to the adoption of this emergency ordinance . 
  '' ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/romanias-government-will-revoke-emergency-ordinance-justice/ ) looks like he will shove all the blame on the justice minister , maybe get him to resign and then walk away just fine by himself . 
  it 's great news that the ordinance will be gone of course but i think romania is still going to be stuck with a shitty government for quite some time . 
  yeah kinda sad when countries that allow american military bases on their soil are not considered allies . 
  oh they know how the eu works alright . 
  they are just poking with a stick to see if they can find any holes . 
  the amount of salt from / r/all in these comments is hilarious . 
  to the americans apologising for your leader : do n't worry we might judge usa by its government , but not its inhabitants . 
  we know there are plenty of good americans . 
  european countries always shit on their neighbours ;-) . 
  probably would 've gotten the same from your dutch friends if you had gone to belgium . 
  do n't worry we all still remember bush too . 
  this will pass . 
  yes our unemployment numbers were ( for dutch standards ) extremely high in 2013 . 
  one of the worst years in our recent history . 
  it was at about 8.5 % . 
  this year we are around 5 % and steadily decreasing . 
  2013 is 4 years ago . 
  not really relevant today . 
  we recovered a bit more slowly because our economy depends on trade so much . 
  the people here that are against the eu are mostly anti immigration . 
  they just want closed borders and no workers from other countries . 
  they do n't know anything about what the eu does and how it affects their lives . 
  they only know `` eu = bad so more eu = more bad '' . 
  i can ensure you that pvv will not be able to use the eu involvement to fight corruption in romania and to fight restrictions on press freedom in poland to their advantage . 
  well the dutch public news broadcaster has posted 2 articles about the romania situation today so at least you guys are getting some more attention now . 
  it 's just them being arrogant about not being arrogant . 
  i like the swiss one most . 
  good luck today guys . 
  are you expecting a turnout as big as yesterday ? 
  did the incidents yesterday scare any people away from protesting ? 
  i hope they still have some space available . 
  we could take it to new heights . 
  yea he has a very unusual accent for a dutch person . 
  i suppose it 's because of his long experience with other languages and different countries .

  come on serisouly wtf dude ? 
  please stop this awful trend . 
  timmermans is a very genuine and passionate politician . 
  i 'm glad he is clearly speaking out against the romanian government 's move . 
  tomorrow there will be an informal summit of the eu leaders in valletta . 
  mainly going to be about libya and trump , but i hope they use it as a chance to adress this issue as well . 
  i think it 's very important for romania 's future . 
   < < < context    : under the pretext that the european court of human rights mentioned our prisons are getting crowded , the government passed an emergency ordnance late last night * . 
  this ordnance made it so that abuse of office is not considered a crime if the damages are below $ 48,000 . 
  it also modifies the penal code so that denunciations can only be made within 6 months after the fact , which makes it harder to fight crime , corruption , terrorism or drug-trafficking . 
  nepotism is also allowed now !, 
  thousands of corrupt people , politicians and moguls will be pardoned through this ordnance . 
  also , any illegal activity committed through a normative act is no longer illegal ( this ordnance included ! ) . 
  * note : an emergency ordnance is passed almost immediately , but since they modified the penal code too , it takes 10 days at a minimum to come into effect so there 's a chance to fight it, 
  sanctions and yeah general political pressure .
