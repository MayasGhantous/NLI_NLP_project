  the real question is . . who the hell is that creep slovakia is googling for ? 
  yeah too many trump lovers in the rest of europe ;-) at least we care about more important things haha . 
  if you need space to lock up prisoners send them here . 
  my country has closed a ton of prisons over the past 10 years . 
  we also rented them out to norway and belgium for a while . 
  norway is still renting one of our prisons . 
  the d66 members of the europarlement abstained from voting though . 
  how is moldova 's relationship with russia generally ? 
  is there a chance of them becoming pretty much a satelite state of russia ? 
  we do n't hear much about them over here in the west . 
  winter is coming and the long night that never ends is upon us . 
  that 's glorious . 
  ikeas are amazing . 
  every country deserves to have ikeas !, 
  we have a very similar word in dutch , `` zondagsrijder '' which translates to sunday driver . 
  meaning the same : a bad/inconsiderate driver . 
  orange . 
  the building looks pretty neat from the outside imo . 
  it 's also ecofriendly which is good . 
  i love the design of that meeting room , but at the same time i would hate using it to work in . 
  think it would be rather distracting . 
  any link to the actual interview ? 
  exactly what i was thinking too . 
  kind of frustrating , but as long as vvd stays in power here that will never change . 
  i 'm sorry you had to go through this . 
  i hope your sister will fully recover soon . 
  sadly doctors are only humans so they make mistakes sometimes . 
  i 'm no doctor myself so i ca n't judge the specifics of this case . 
  i believe in my country when a doctor fucks up bad there usually is an investigation that may lead to him/her getting fired if it is concluded that he made unforgivable mistakes . 
  however , with that being said , it 's impossible to always find the cause of every sympton . 
  ideally everyone would frequently get a full health checkup and all sorts of bodyscans to look for possible diseases . 
  this is entirely unrealistic though because of the insane costs . 
  the truth is we ca n't always save everyone , even if we have the knowledge available to cure them . 
   the quality of medical treatment is declining in the western world , due to greed and privatization . 
  do you have any data/research to support this claim ? 
  netherlands on a 3d map looks the same as it does on a normal map . 
  it 's all fun and games until your frozen dick breaks off . 
  so it took just 4 days for such a thick layer ice to form in a river since the moment the fox broke through ? 
  that 's absolutely insane . 
  how cold was it ? 
  i 'm not 100 % sure if i believe this story . 
  the river on the background does n't look frozen ? 
   that 's probably related to how closely something affects you personally . 
  absolutely true . 
  i 'm a bisexual male myself but because i live in a town ( population around 25000 ) i do n't get a lot of contact with muslims . 
  it also helps that i wo n't be perceived as gay unless i 'm dating another man . 
  i do n't feel like letting gay-bashing control my life though . 
  `` native '' dutch people also still do ** way ** too much of that . 
  the amount of homophobic slurs that got thrown around in highschool was insane . 
  also when i worked in garbage collection for a few years i overheard plenty of conversations talking about being gay as `` gross '' and `` weird '' . 
  religion did n't have anything to do with that either . 
  one of my coworkers was found out to be dragqueen sometimes in his spare time . 
  the amount of shit he got . . 
  in both of those environments i did not feel safe to be open about my sexuality at all . 
  for the record , i was n't calling it irrational fear . 
  lgbt people have plenty of reason to be worried . 
  the pvv just tends to make things bigger than they are and also present hate as their main solution . 
  they seem to forget that christians were equally bigoted not so long ago . 
  they still are , in lots of countries . 
  oh of course the nuclear power bullshit excuse . 
  do you honestly believe that any nation in the world in their right minds is willing to start a nuclear war ? 
  not to mention if russia used nukes within europe it would probably affect their own country as well . 
  there is a 0 % chance that russia would be willing to start a war against all of continental europe , simple as that . 
  there is no need to speculate about some stupid `` what if '' scenario . 
  they have nothing to gain from war . 
  nor do we have anything to gain from starting a war . 
  we have our own defence . 
  the usa contributes to it but united european forces can easily hold off a russian threat ( which is hardly a realistic threat to begin with ) . 
  let 's make yurop stronk again !, 
  care to translate ? 
  well right now it 's still raining here , rather than snowing . 
  with all this water on the ground i do n't think the snow will last at all , even if it does snow for a few hours later tonight . 
  well the article suggests that it 's mostly politicians being scared to do something about it , no ? 
   according to a nationally representative poll from the summer of 2016 , 87 % of danes favor a legal ban on non-therapeutic circumcision of boys under the age of 18 years . 
  so far , politicians have been hesitant , but increasingly willing to listen . 
   what a surprise that you 'd assume i do n't know what kosovo is or where it 's located . 
  not what i was implying at all . 
  you are reading too much into comments and getting defensive because of that . 
  circumcision on baby boys is unneeded mutulation regardless of what country it takes place in . 
  the reason some europeans feel the need to center out the usa on this issue is because they are expected to have moral values similar to those in europe and other western countries . 
   acting like circumcision practiced on 30 month old boys by what essentially account to tribesmen is akin to what happens in the us is just a fallacious false equivalency . 
  / u/tvrtkoikraljsrbljem has n't mentioned usa in his comment . 
  he was talking about something that happened in kosovo , which is europe . 
  consequently he said it should not be tolerated in ** europe ** today . 
  you 're the one bringing the us into this because you feel the need to defend your country before it even was attacked . 
  i do n't think there is much to discuss here . 
  surely most of europe feels the same way ? 
  obviously people voting for pvv and similar right wing parties do think it 's a `` very real , very legitimate potential threat '' as you say . 
  i do n't agree that there is one , that 's why i would describe it as fear mongering . 
  regardless , my point was that in the netherlands the far right has n't been anti semitic towards jews for decades . 
  it 's just not a thing . 
  [ it 's the perfect plan . . ] ( http://www.livingspace.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/according-to-plan.jpg ), 
  it 's a win win , the brits get rid of a bunch of their chavs and greece can keep its islands . 
  i would n't mind having a nice summer villa on one of these islands . 
  if there was a sgp equivalent for muslims they would probably vote for that . 
  muslims do n't really have right wing parties representing them at the moment . 
  also the political right gets associated with antisemitism because of its politicians and the things they say . 
  the left wing politicians do n't really say antisemitic things ( at least , i ca n't think of any examples ) . 
  yes you 're right , in that regard the american republicans have evolved somewhat , but only very recently . 
  but at the same time trump did choose mike pence of all people as his vp so there 's that . .
