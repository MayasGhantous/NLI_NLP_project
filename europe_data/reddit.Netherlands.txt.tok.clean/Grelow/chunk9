  everything in our airports is expensive . 
  btw in most west european countries you can easily drink from the tap . 
  i consider buying water to be quite a silly thing to do in my country . 
  does n't really apply to all of europe but generally because the government has invested a lot of money in train infrastructure . 
  because of the density of europe it is very much worth it because commuters use the train a lot . 
  honestly london is probably my least favourite capital city out of the ones i 've visited . 
  e : that 's including canberra , aus, 
  oy , stick to yer taters, 
  netherlands . 
  the refugee crisis does not affect me personally . 
  my country did receive quite a few refugees but we can easily handle it . 
  i would like to see more european cooperation to help solve the crisis . 
  i love greek food . 
  it is very difficult to name a ` worst ' food country because europe consists of about 50 countries and i 've only visited 10 of them . 
  i 'm not a big fan of polish food . 
  [ poolse bruid ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142772/ ) ( polish bride ) . 
  as for books , i kinda stopped reading in my teens and do n't care for dutch literature . 
  oh i agree , do n't worry . 
  everyone is free to do what they want . 
  it 's just more ideal ( from my point of view ) if everyone was atheist . 
  the existence of multiple `` competing '' religions causes problems . 
  if there were no christians we could 've moved on from anti gay sentiment much sooner in our country . 
  islam is one of the reasons why it is so hard for turks and moroccans to integrate in our society . 
  sure , if someone is only moderately religious you probably wo n't ever notice it . 
  but as soon as a religion starts to get threatened people only get more religious . 
  anyways i 'm not saying we should ban religion or anything . 
  i think the way we have seperated state and religion in our country works pretty well . 
  nothing needs to be changed . 
  i was just giving my view of a more ideal society . 
  '' ** atheist community ** '' - there 's your problem . 
  i 've never heard of such a thing here . 
  atheism is just what it says ; non religion . 
  it 's not some sort of anti religion movement . 
  i do n't care if people choose to be religious . 
  it 's their own business , and it should stay that way . 
  it 's a private thing here , talking about it is mostly a taboo . 
  being religious or not does not affect a person 's personality . 
  it only affects people 's actions and way of thinking . 
  so of course there 's nice religious people just like there are nice atheists too . 
  the reason i said i `` prefer '' if everyone would be atheist is because religion stops people from being progressive . 
  it holds back change . 
  it 's one of the driving forces of anti-lgbt sentiment . 
  religion is a box that limits the open mind . 
  plus it 's a large cultural barrier because of the main religions competing against eachother . 
  i thought he met up with the leaders of a drug gang at first . 
  i think us dutch would generally prefer if everyone in our country that is n't atheist already , became atheist . 
  you are absolutely correct . 
  the person that came up with the idea has very idealistic globalist views . 
  basically what it comes down to is the cause of all of the world 's problems ca n't be solved due to individual countries focussing on their own population and problems . 
  he sees competition between countries as a problem and wants to make a change so everyone starts thinking about the whole world instead of their own country . 
  yes and no . 
  obviously any ranking such as this has to be taken with a grain of salt ( or multiple ) . 
  the stats used for this ranking give a very black and white image . 
  most of them are relative for the size of the country 's economy btw . 
  the idea behind making a ranking like this is for governments and large organisations to look beyond their own country . 
  what we do affects the whole world now due to globalisation . 
  it wants to activate an ( idealistic ) mindset that strives to make the world a better place or something . 
  objectivity regarding this ranking and having political motivations for making it are not mutually exclusive in my opinion . 
  i agree it sounds odd , but i think what they mean is that they are not saying x country is not doing enough to contribute , or x country are selfish - just because they rank low . 
  most of the lowest ranking countries are war torn and/or in extreme poverty & economical crisis . 
  they do n't have the resources to contribute to the greater good of humanity . 
  if you live through the day worrying about whether you can feed your kids , helping others or the environment are probably not on your mind . 
  it would n't make you a worse person . 
  `` the idea of the good country index is pretty simple : to measure what each country on earth contributes to the common good of humanity , and what it takes away , relative to its size . 
  using a wide range of data from the u.n. and other international organisations , we 've given each country a balance-sheet to show at a glance whether it 's a net creditor to mankind , a burden on the planet , or something in between . 
  it 's important to explain that we are not making any moral judgments about countries . 
  what we mean by a good country is something much simpler : it 's a country that contributes to the greater good of humanity . 
  a country that serves the interests of its own people , but without harming - and preferably by advancing - the interests of people in other countries too . '', 
  you do n't get karma from asking waiters !, 
  yeah who the hell would want to live in mountains ? 
  you ca n't even cycle there easily !, 
  to add to the facts : * she has lived in switzerland from age 8 , so for 34 years now . 
  * she was married to a swiss man * she has raised 3 children born in switzerland * her entire life is in switzerland , all of her friends and social activities . 
  * she mostly wants the passport so she can take part in political activities ( vote ) * without the passport she would still be allowed to stay in switzerland . 
  every train also has free wifi and the trains they started using this year have power outlets below every seat , including usb port to charge your phone . 
  :d but other than that , the current government is not doing all that much to battle climate change . 
  their policy is to kind of do follow the average eu trend when it comes to that . 
  it really annoys me . 
  we have plenty of money to be one of the leading countries when it comes to clean energy and other climate neutral solutions . 
  um which article are you referring to ? 
  lol, 
  asking the important questions . 
  i love that , makes him a lot more relatable for normal people . 
  i think directors/ceo 's of companies should do that kind of stuff too . 
  i worked in garbage collection for a few years ( one of the most fun jobs in the world , i swear ) and we had our ceo join us for a day on the road too one time . 
  just shows you they 're human and that you can get to know them too . 
  would eating your flag really be nationalistic though . . 
  i wonder . 
  it depends on how it 's done . 
  if they are put on an island with no option but to wait until someone decides their faith that 's effectively imprisonment . 
  since they have n't committed any crimes , that can clearly be considered a violation of human rights . 
  even if they have the option to leave , but only to go to their own country then that would still be a violation of human rights if that country is unsafe ( such as syria ) . 
  however , my main issue with this idea is that it is very difficult to execute without creating pretty inhumane conditions for those people . 
  we 're talking about hundreds of thousands of people , in uncertainty about their families and future . 
  the reality is that it does n't take `` a few weeks '' to process their requests for asylum . 
  it 's taking ** months ** right now . 
  sometimes years . 
  and if they get rejected ? 
  they can simply start a new procedure . 
  the next problem is how are we going to divide these refugees fairly once they have been accepted ?
