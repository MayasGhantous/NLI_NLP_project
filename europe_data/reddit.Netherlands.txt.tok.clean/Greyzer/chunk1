[ there 's the van heutsz monument ] ( https://nl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/monument_indi\u00eb-nederland ) . 
  no , not directly . 
  better get off reddit then !, 
  no , we send those south . 
  i think that political ideals made the eu accept new members that were n't ready yet . 
  bulgaria and romania especially . 
  the same thing happened with the introduction of the euro . 
  if you have an italian passport , you are an eu national . 
  * nice weather during my vacation * new location * country where i feel safe and that has rule-of-law * maximum 4 hours flight ( my wife has bad knees ) * nightlife in the area i usually fly and rent a car ( unless i 'm in a city ) . 
  i prefer apartments/airbnbs so i can cook myself . 
  the language barrier is no big deal usually ( i speak english/dutch/german / french and a little bit of spanish/portuguese/italian ) . 
  [ amsterdam has one too ] ( https://amsterdamlightfestival.com/ ), 
  at least the finns did n't ever win one either ... 
  40-45 hours a week . 
  not a norwegian driving license . 
  get a passport . 
  nah , it 's contagious , like many religions . 
  nice try , aivd !, 
   especially - but not exclusively - swearwords that 's right , co\u00f1o !, 
  yeah , you can keep your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free . 
  no backsies !, 
   i 'll be able to call spanish landlines for free wrong : you 'll be able to call italian numbers for free . 
  spanish numbers will be just as expensive as when you 're in italy . 
  calling to any other country than italy will cost you . 
  because nobody speaks dutch . 
  your citizenship has very little to do with the height of your taxes . 
  it 's residency that counts , unless you 're from a backward country like eritrea or the united states . 
  we 'd have to start with the roads . 
  how about belgium and luxemburg ? 
  nobody is going to refund your stolen equipment unless you were insured . 
  people would think you 're deluded at best and deranged at worst . 
  it 's easily double that in australia . 
  socks in slippers for me . 
  barefoot in slippers for the rest of the family . 
  we should invest more in developing nuclear fusion plants . 
  filter coffee with a little powdered creamer . 
  the standard is filter or senseo pads nowadays ( at home/work at least , in bars and restaurants espresso machines are the norm ) . 
  sugar and milk optional . 
  there 's no point in having a large quota if you do n't have the boats/industry to use it . 
  quotas were usually negociated based on the size of the fleet at that time . 
  so if ireland did n't have many boats , they would get a low percentage of ` their ' fish . 
  to prevent a [ tragedy of the commons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tragedy_of_the_commons ) . 
  we have had a fusion of the dutch reformed , the reformed and lutherans in the netherlands called the pkn . 
  besides that there still a few fundamentalist reformed churches . 
  lately there 's been a rise of several evangelical groups ( pentecoastal/7th day adventists/jehovahs witnesses ) , especially under migrants . 
  yeah , it 's a cultural thing . 
  most restaurant will ( either happily or with a grudgingly ) bring you some tap water if you ask for it specifically . 
  some assholes flat out refuse to serve it . 
  this is occurs mostly in northern europe . 
  mixed nuts . 
  andalusia and ibiza . 
  spanish tap water is nasty . 
  too much chlorine . 
  that 's how they make money . 
  on the other hand , you do n't have to tip 20 % . 
  give the tories a few more years ... 
  they 'll learn when we take their cars ... 
  they practically speak dutch already . 
  well , at least no worse than the limburgers . 
  i thought their public transport was n't bad at all ( around lisbon ) . 
  north rhine would make a nice extra province ... 
  the netherlands is obviously from the riverlands . 
  so one of the coastal houses : mallister or mooton ? 
  stark always felt more scottish to me . 
  greyjoy = vikings obviously . 
  whole wheat bread with cheese and a glass of milk . 
  boring is good if you have a child . 
  any good muslim should be able to speak some basic arabic . 
  it 's more effici\u00ebnt to learn a language that 's spoken where few people speak english . 
  if your goal is to be able to communictate with as many people as possible . 
  it should be illegal unless there is no other option for the child to go to a normal school and the caregiver is a certified teacher and the national curriculum is followed and tested . 
  renting a car and dropping it off in another country will be really expensive . 
  for cute , coastal quaintness , i 'd recommend zierikzee or veere . 
   also , i do n't care about needing to find a job because i work online . 
  do you have eu-citizenship ? 
  otherwise getting a visa will be difficult , depending on the country of choice ... 
  most people that speak swedish will already speak english . 
   90 % or more of people in kentucky or the ghetto would be able to integrate just by their education and fluency in english . 
  ehhh , just no !, 
  have you ever been to europe or spoken with a real life european ? 
  stupidity does n't have to be respected . 
  gunpowder tea . 
  [ stroopwafel ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyfoodporn/comments/6jjphn/i_tried_to_make_stroopwafels_using_a_waffle_maker/ ) . 
  under the benevolent leadership of [ king willem ] ( https://staatsieportretten.nl/remote-images/staatsiefoto-koning-met-koningsmantel.jpg ) . 
  apparently there is an intermediary providing insurance for non-residents . 
  [ more info here ] ( http://advrider.com/index.php?threads/uk-motorcycle-insurance-for-non-residents-is-now-available.1165906/ ) . 
   it looks like gambling only exists in impoverished places even in the us it ** exists ** everywhere . 
  it 's just not legal everywhere ... 
  are you sure you can even register a bike without residency ? 
  and if it 's registered in the uk , that 's where you need to get it insured ( which also will be hard without residency ) . 
  a rather huge flop iirc . 
  what about [ blauwestad ? 
  thank you !, 
  seemed like an easy day to remember !, 
  bavaria does feel very different from berlin to me . 
  maybe it 's just southern germany that should join france/belgium/italy . 
  it 's just a [ tourist thing in amsterdam ] ( http://www.interferenties.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/amsterdam-taxi.jpg ) . 
  yes , it 's my wedding anniversary !, 
  i 'd divide [ by religion ] ( http://www.churchpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/traditional-religions.png ) . 
  it feels very much linked to the culture and mindset to me .
