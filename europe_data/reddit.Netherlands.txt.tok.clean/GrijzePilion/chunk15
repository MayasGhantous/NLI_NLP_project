  they always have these plans ( trump builds a wall , farage has the uk leave the eu , wilders bans islam ) , but every time it turns out that those plans are completely unrealistic . 
  i usually say quid or bucks as well . 
  it 's not right though, 
  piek , i think . 
  a `` ten euro '' shirt would 've cost `` tien piek '' . 
  what was yours ? 
  i still do n't think brexit 's gon na happen , and this is why . 
  it 's a bit like trump . 
  not gon na happen either . 
  not * really * , at least . 
  germans are really funny when they 're on tv , for some reason . 
  on reddit , not so much . 
  i do n't think we need to worry about the yanks the coming years . 
  with a bit of luck we 're gon na be able to rob 'em of every record , statistic and source of income they have . 
  yeah , like a strawpoll or something . 
  or one of those twitter polls . 
  disregarding less important issues because there are ones that are considered more important is no way to live . 
  and besides , what issues ? 
  i 'm not seeing any besides the media being turned into a bunch of lying , clickbaiting bastards . 
  no shit . 
  there 's no real danger . 
  hell , europe is safer than it used to be . 
  by a lot . 
  it 's a pretty well-known song . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtvnmo6crfg ), 
  he certainly has an accent . 
  it sounds like a mix between actual flemish and a frenchman speaking dutch with an accent . 
  i do n't know a whole lot of beautifully sung dutch song , but for me [ het dorp by wim sonneveld ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8ff5oeuzd8 ) comes to mind . 
  it 's a very nostalgic song about his ( or actually , his boyfriend 's ) childhood town as he sees it tainted by progress and modern technology . 
  til jacques brel was belgian . 
  maybe like a sewn-on patch or something . 
  we really need to do something about breitbart . 
  maybe sue it out of existance ? 
  [ the spa-francorchamps motor-racing circuit . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circuit_de_spa-francorchamps ) wow , truly ahead of it 's time for 1831 . 
  we can arrange that . 
  i have no idea , ask someone else . 
  i think that 's how it 's works , yeah . 
  they 'd need to have control ( either directly or indirectly ) over the majority of the seats to form a working government . 
  but i 'm no expert . 
  i ca n't find anything on that , but judging by the other trains i 'm seeing it ca n't be all that bad , can it ? 
  even the worst train i 've seen still looks alright-ish . 
  not really . 
  they 're democrats and they were founded in ' 66 . 
  it 's like if the art of the deal was actually written by trump . 
  other way round . 
  you mean the dutch ? 
  i do n't think that 's sad at all , strangely enough . 
  [ looks pretty new to me ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=pkp+intercity&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiipmssyabrahuye1akhqstcroq_auicsgc&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950 ) . 
   flemish accent can be very , very sexy . 
  their roads are shit, 
  i think we should be burning the perps instead . 
  at the stake , like in good old times . 
  being an asshole/hufter should become a capital offense again . 
  ... and that 's why i 'm not in charge of anything . 
  i can assume that there were more fossil vehicles targeted than electric ones , so at least there 's that . 
  really ? 
  how odd . 
  oh , thought it was about the guy in the thumbnail . 
  say what you want , but you ca n't deny that the jewish people have interesting names . 
  that 's strangely adorable . 
  exactly . 
  this whole us wall bullshit is way overdone and has been from day one . 
  i 've been saying so from day one . 
  in europe , it actually makes sense to have these walls . 
  i 'm dutch . 
  if the sea gives any problems , we 're the first you can count on to solve it . 
  oh definitely . 
  if you 're gon na do homo stuff , no better place to do it than here . 
  tall = attractive , apparently . 
  me and you both . 
  which is why we need to build a wall . 
  but fuck america if they dare to be so cruel to do the same thing . 
  in my/our defense , mexicans probably are n't as easy to radicalize . 
  i 'd say america 's culture is more macho . 
  who is it for then ? 
  one 's wife ? 
  which is like the opposite of real life right now ... 
  man , i ca n't wait to go to space . 
  there 's a difference between awareness and fearmongering . 
   well this is mapporn is it though ? 
  we should build a wall to keep bullshit headlines like this one out . 
  please just post actual trains . 
  i like trains . 
  based italy . 
  following the us is a kind of degeneracy . 
  we need to stop fucking doing it right now . 
  blm once shut down heathrow airport . 
  in london . 
  there is n't even institutionalized fuckin ' racism in london . 
  our cops are known for being almost shockingly intolerant around black people , but that do n't warrant a blm attack either . 
  i should get on many streets . 
  dutch streets , american streets , quality street ... 
   white people will continue lecturing me on twitter and even sometimes irl over what real islam when they have n't looked at a koran in their entire life . 
  that 's * nearly * racist . 
  most sensible , moderately anti-islamic people are white . 
  `` water probably wet ( will require further investigation ) '' . 
  who r u callin a m8 m8, 
  * `` protesting does n't work !, 
  okay , i 've lost you now .
