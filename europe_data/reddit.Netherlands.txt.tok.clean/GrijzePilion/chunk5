  i agree , it should 've happened already . 
  but that 's too late now , so we must take action now . 
  the point is , it 's a matter of time . 
  changing the values people are taught in schools will take several generations to make a big change . 
  threaten to confiscate their money , ban them from teaching , fine them , put them in jail , have them be monitored ... 
  i 'm definitely in favour of headscarves , i do n't have a problem with them at all . 
  but in some official functions , i do think no religious attributes should be worn . 
  so it was previously banned ? 
  i do remember hearing that turkey is becoming less secular , which is obviously the last thing any country should do . 
  a clear difference , and a welcome one if you ask me . 
  not to claim any credit , but the dutch and the ~ ~ germans ~ ~ belgians have always been leaders in european unity . 
  surely they can , they 're not not trying very hard . 
  one common theme in europe seems to be that we 'd rather be nice than efficient . 
  it 's admirable , but a bit too soft . 
  til h&m is swedish and not swiss . 
  if the schools and mosques stop preaching these values , which is something we can make happen , eventually muslims will lose their edge and start fitting in better . 
  even though turkey is only mildly religious , relatively speaking , is that realistic ? 
  how about the hijab/headscarf ban ? 
  and here i am thinking they were long banned already . 
  extremes do n't count . 
  they have oil . 
  who hurt you ? 
  i 'm open to a second opinion , but i did n't ask for a depressing , dystopian , most likely exaggerated look into the future . 
  is it not ? 
   an admirable stance . 
  one of my most sincerely held beliefs . 
  i 'm for the kind where women and blacks and gays and whoever else do n't get denied anything simply for being . 
  i want to live in a world where a black gay woman has exactly the same opportunities and chances as me , a white straight guy . 
  and i would n't want that lady to be harassed or made fun of . 
  well that 's equality taken to the extreme . 
  people should n't be fully equal in physique or wealth , that 's not only ridiculous but also completely unrealistic . 
  i 'm slightly wealthier than the average person , i 'm completely average in terms of looks , but i 'm slightly shorter , but i 'm considerably more intelligent and i 'm considerably worse at socializing . 
  i 'm not a fan of extremes but for the most part , i do n't believe in such forms of equality . 
  you and i both live in * very * different societies if that 's true for you . 
  there 's a reason christianity is on the decline here and a large part of that is because people are ridiculed and excluded when they 're openly religious . 
  which , i should add , is something i wholeheartedly support . 
  fuck 'em and fuck what they stand for . 
  exactly . 
  but unfortunately , many of them are too ignorant and naive to realise that the reason they live in poverty and wars is * because * they hold such archaic beliefs . 
  worse yet , when some of them come here they refuse to shake their beliefs . 
  i believe that they have no right to be here if they think and act like that . 
  exactly . 
  but unfortunately , many of them are too ignorant and naive to realise that the reason they live in poverty and wars is * because * they hold such archaic beliefs . 
  worse yet , when some of them come here they refuse to shake their beliefs . 
  i could make a point about them infringing on my right to look at hot beach babes ... but headscarves are fine , i do n't have a problem with them . 
  either way , someone who wears a burkini is more likely to also hold beliefs or engage in activities that are incompatible with our society . 
  therefore it 's logical , albeit slightly unfair , to ban burkinis simply to make a point . 
  the point being , ** your customs are not welcome here ** . 
  the soviet union was pretty good if not for the communism . 
  you ca n't seriously expect people to all be as rich as one another , but other than that i 'm sure they knew what they were doing . 
  it 's not hate speech . 
  equality is not religious oppression , it 's fucking equality . 
  government-sponsored secularism is , to quote my favourite pointy-eared fictional character , logical . 
  everybody is , * until * they start being assholes . 
  ** that ** is the beauty of our system . 
  be nice , do n't hurt anyone , and you 're golden . 
  be religious all you want , be any skin colour you want , love anyone you want , but as soon as you start bothering others in ways they do n't like , you 're done with . 
  sounds like my kind of oppression . 
  love it !, 
  islam is unworthy of a liberal democracy . 
  i get your perspective , but i 've decided it no longer works . 
  and the fun thing is , they can never win . 
  we 're way too powerful , the only reason we 've been so reluctant to react is because we 're incredibly nice . 
  we could nuke them but we obviously wo n't . 
  you can kill a few hundred people but in the end , it 's only a statistic . 
  they 'd need to kill many tens of thousands to actually make a change . 
  i 'm biased towards girl-on-girl but that does n't give me any right to be a fucking bigot , you know ? 
  oh god . 
  what the actual fuck is wrong with people 's geography skill ? 
  i 'd say we do n't mistakes like this but apparently we do too . 
  the fuck ? 
   the difference lies in interpretation and individual zeal of the followers , not so much the religion itself . 
  theory vs. practice . 
  and theory does n't mean shit when the reality or the practice is stuff like isis or the wbc . 
  actually , it 's * freedom of religion as long as your religion is n't fuckin ' scummy . 
  * so that rules out most of islam and select bits of christianity . 
  ca n't speak for judaism , but they do n't seem to be a problem . 
  so there 's still shit going on in ukraine ? 
  til . 
  do n't be sorry , you 're not a goddamn canuck . 
  dammit , this was the part where i was going to be clever and have all the names and codes ready and shit . 
  because it does . 
  look at steam 's flag , then look at your flair . 
  oh for fuck 's sake , go back to / r/murica . 
  i 'm preeeeetty sure the dutch flag has the wrong colours . 
  now this , this pisses me off . 
  how so ? 
  it looks alright to me , if not for the fact that finland and whatever 's between serbia and greece are missing . 
  ... so americans and canadians ca n't just hop their completely unprotected borders ? 
  that 's really odd . 
  the funny thing is , every dutch kid builds stuff like that when they 're at the beach . 
  i 'm not sure about other kids , but ours certainly do . 
  we should go build a second flevoland . 
  actually , we should 've already done that . 
  we should be on our third by now . 
   it is like the difference between citizen of the usa and native american the difference being , white americans have been in america long enough to be universally considered the `` real '' americans . 
  north african immigrants have been coming here for less than a century , so it 'll be a long while before they integrate fully . 
  who gives a shit about non-imperial nations ? 
  not to brag or anything , but we 're the ones doing best overall . 
  it 's us and the countries we hang out with .
