  society has a task here , as we see with the ` buddy 's ' for example . 
  ( giving young people some pocket money or other advantages if they spend the tuesday afternoon with a cup of tea and a card game with a lonely elderly ) putting these people to sleep is too easily brushing off a form of responsibility you have as a society . 
  there 's not a single use of `` stand '' . 
  if you do not want to quote someone , do n't use quotations . 
  ` stand ' is not a word i used , please avoid indulging in slander . 
  if your memory is failing you , you can [ recollect it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ogw4v/hungary_stands_by_poland_and_calls_on_the/dkhcb78/ ) . 
  seems like a waste . 
   how do you expect they will `` force ngo ships to change course '' ? 
   you should probably ask dw , because those are their words . 
  it 's only 12 miles back to where they came from . 
  more efficiently would be to have them board the ngo vessel , drop them off , and tow their rafts/ships to italy and sell them to recycling companies . 
  ngo 's are not militaries . 
  if we had ships to spare to do so . 
  perhaps we can ask portugal , belgium and chile to sell our ships back . 
   i personally do n't understand the opposition to euthanasia , because it 's a cheap opportunity to do away with your responsibilities as a society . 
  do n't you think when people want to die , that there can actually be things we can do that makes it * worth living * for them ? 
  it can be extremely simple , like the ` buddy ' system . 
  right wing conspiracies everywhere . 
  do n't forget your tin foil hat . 
  we drink a lot of milk , finland too . 
  naturally , after luhansk socialist republic and donetsk socialist republic the proletarians of mallerussia are now rising up to create the next dictatorship of the workers , and rid them of the bourgeoisie kievan rus and their individualistic farms feeding people with their capitalist poison . 
  proletarians of all nations , unite !, 
  you do n't even notice them . 
  problem is that they 're quite devastating to buildings . 
  while of these things might matter , i 'm sure they would still vote no . 
  they just do n't want it , why should they after all , any developed country has no reason to join . 
  the eu is attractive to poor countries , for the time being , not to rich well governed countries like norway or switzerland . 
  it is , however i ca n't use that word , autocensorship removes all my replies containing it . 
  it may have been a slight form of sarcasm . 
  only 17 % of the germans in 2007 believed suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilians to defend their religion can be justified . 
  and only 36 % of the french . 
  they 're still minorities . 
  the smugglers own the boats , they 're all phsycially onboard as they make port to unload in italy . 
   what means would they have to bring the immigrants to the shore if the boat starts sinking ? 
  they 've done some dangerous maneuvers against the libyan coast guard , but none of them have yet sunk . 
  not likely , then they can leave it to the smugglers to bring them to italy . 
  they have more means to do so . 
  ca n't say they 're extremist . 
  they want to rescue people , just like all the others there . 
  they just intend to bring them to the nearest safe port , instead of hundreds of miles away . 
  hardly an extreme notion . 
   there is ( or maybe used to be ) difference between `` groups like these '' and reputable news sources , like dw . 
  comparitively little in the basis . 
  both are populist demagogues . 
  they just have different ideas of who their mortal enemy is and how to rile up their audiences . 
   the sweet irony of insulting french of communism yet talking about nationalization right after . 
  temporarily . 
  we wanted klm to be commercial , the french did n't hold up their word , so the ultimate goal would be to commercialize it anyway . 
   it 's always a pleasure to trigger the nationalist and it only cost a 6 $ tax cut . 
  best deal ever . 
  nothing nationalistic about being against state-communism . 
   also , yes , please skyrocket the value of air france klm share . 
  actually the shares have plummeted from 13,49 to 11,90 in 2 days . 
  ` funding ' is done through treaties and contracts , you ca n't just break them . 
  you can only decide not to make new commitments , but these effects will take time to be felt . 
   a final ultimatum to poland  with what consequences ? 
   suspend eu funds for cohesion , agriculture , infrastructure etc this is not possible , only a slow reduction over time would be possible . 
   strip voting rights of poland this requires unanimity , which is not possible if hungary supports poland . 
   suspend polish membership that is not possible . 
  only membership rights can be suspended , and only with a lengthy procedure which requires the full support of 27 countries . 
   expel poland from the eu this is not possible , ever . 
  a country can only leave on its own account . 
  the better option is probably the same approach as they did with austria . 
  let everybody break diplomatic contact with poland , no meetings or communication anymore , pass laws that slowly reduce benefits poland gets , bring them to court , fine them ( this is possible without political support ) , substract their fines from the funds . 
  they say eyes are the windows of the soul . 
  i think that 's quite accurate in this instance . 
  support is probably even worse now indeed , the 1990s early 2000s were the years of hope and optimism for the eu , until everything went to shit . 
  it 's interesting to compare norway as well ; 2003 ; * yes - 37 % * no - 38 % 2016 ; * yes - 16 % * no - 66 % [ sauce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norway%e2%80%93european_union_relations#opinion_polling ) pretty sure that if we had the same question now , we would be against as well . 
  that 's nice . 
  in that case i do n't see the problem , if you can neatly restore a bus , why not do it . 
  it 's the same bus , except with a new front section and paint job . 
  i sure hope they did change the engine though , every time someone starts up a 1970s bus diesel two people spontaneously die of lung cancer . 
   switzerland -- 1997 : requiring the approval of a referendum and the cantons to launch accession negotiations with the eu , ** 74.1 % against **  switzerland -- 2001 : opening negotiations for eu membership , ** 76.8 % against ** seems very unlikely , the swiss do n't want the eu ( and that was in a time when the eu was still nice ) , they value their own statehood and independence . 
  the problem is that swiss politicians want ( ed ) to join but the swiss people do n't , just like the norwegians , where the government wanted to , but the people not . 
  i do n't think ` reforms ' will change their mind . 
   it is a commercial company . 
  just not as much as you guys would want it to be . 
  but you do n't own enough of it anymore to have a say in the matter . 
  the french broke their promise . 
  the company was supposed to be commercial , not your regular french state communism . 
   now i do n't know how you can buy klm since it does n't exist anymore . 
  unlike the french we 're not broke and bankrupt . 
  the merger was always intended to produce a commercial company . 
  france just broke their promise . 
  if necessary , the finance ministry already said it 's ready to buy klm out . 
  due to the amount of people they directly and indirectly employ and facilities they exploit at schiphol . 
  why does it exclude certain countries , politically motivated ? 
  euhm they cut oranges in half as a threat to the netherlands , and beat up a norwegian journalist because they thought he was dutch . 
  it was already a good idea to avoid the place . 
   and falsely accused and persecuted ultra nationalist secularists out of the military and government . 
  that 's good . 
  slovakia and czechia would n't pick the western side , they have their own grievances over the western attitude and oppose meddling in internal affairs . 
  the rest will depend on how bad it escalates and entrenches . 
   an economic `` war '' between poland , hungary and the rest of the eu would be detrimental to both sides indeed , i expect more members to take their side . 
  there 's a clear east-west divide present , poland and hungary might be at the helm , but there 's a lot more behind it . 
   however the nearly +300 million market of developed europe has much more leverage than the 50 million , sure , and they have more leverage then the 65 million brits as well , more leverage than the 145 million russians , and more leverage than the 80 million turks . 
  you know at some point , when everybody is your enemy , your leverage is n't going to be decisive anymore . 
  that is true . 
  i do n't know the exact content of the bill either , no media seems to actually translate and quote the contents of it . 
  calling a horse a cow does not make it a cow .
