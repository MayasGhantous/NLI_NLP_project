  the * treaty * of lisbon is not a constitution , or the * treaty * on the functioning of the eu and all the other * treaties * are not a constitution . 
  again , the eu * does not have a constitution * . 
   sanctions need not to come through article 7 only . 
  the sanctions on austria were done by the memberstates , not by the eu . 
  this naturally needs no consent of the parliament or council . 
   the net contributors to the eu budget can also decide to withhold the funds , that depends on the legal bases of such funds , you can not just unilaterally stop your commitments under treaties and contracts . 
   effectively terminating the significant funding flows toward the country in question . 
  and they can retaliate . 
  the cohesional funds are to compensate the east for the open borders between two regions with a massive wealth/development discrepancy . 
  when half of europe sanctions the other half and vice versa , i imagine brexit is going to be quite amusing . 
  because in case you have n't forgotten , there 's already a country leaving the eu . 
  the us president appoints the judges of the supreme court in accordance with the senate as well , does the us not have rule of law or modern republican democratic standards ? 
  it does n't , a treaty is not a constitution . 
  a constitution has been specifically rejected by the french and dutch people . 
  the other steps do n't mean anything . 
  it 's been a british plot all along . 
   this . 
  you ca n't describe the how the tc felt when cyprus was admitted into eu even though they rejected the annan plan and tc accepted it . 
  perhaps you should 've offered them something better than the annan plan . 
  of course they refused that offer , and of course the tc accepted it . 
  it was extremely unfair to the greek side , and did nothing about their grievances . 
  you 've no business being in the eu as long you 're a turkish puppet state . 
   now nobody can solve the issue because greek side is currently profiting from the status quo . 
  get used to that then , because that 's how it 's going to be . 
  they would 've to rescind their claim on the north if they would . 
  all in all they may as well take their loss indeed and merge with greece if that 's what cypriots ( and greeks ) want . 
  he 's not actually american . 
  without hungary , an article 7 procedure wo n't make it . 
  so it 's already solved . 
  the eu does n't have a constitution . 
  is the british government shareholder of ba ? 
  ( or iag ? ), 
  british business culture is a better fit probably , but it would be best not to merge with any partially state owned carrier again . 
   is that a saying ? 
  what does the saying mean ? 
  someone who gets screwed ? 
  no not really . 
  moroccans are often discriminated against though , they have a bad name ( even worse than turks ) . 
  so it 's based on that mostly . 
  worlds ' smallest violin manufacturer to resume production . 
   but few very few politicians survive being caught driving drunk . 
  then you should be glad your king is not [ willem . 
  ] ( http://www.anp-archief.nl/image/226/2188896-620-412.jpg ) because ours did n't take the bus home from the bar . 
   at that level in sweden you 'd have your license revoked for a year . 
  that 's too extreme , especially for such an arbitrary difference . 
  yes but you beat passengers out of the airplanes . 
  the french own 17,6 % due to a recent increase , which is against the understanding , as the french government was supposed to decrease their share , which they did from 50 % + originally to 15,6 % up to 2015 . 
  the netherlands owns 5,9 % in klm , but the ministry of finance has already said they will buy the company out if klm is threatened , as they consider it of critical national importance . 
  they also said they will first leave it to airfrance-klm to solve . 
  if the french government wants to play entrepeneur , it 's better for klm to go its own way . 
  klm is a national carrier as well . 
  this was never part of the merging deal , it is a commercial company , not some public healthcare provider . 
  both were supposed to retain their own ` identity ' . 
  it 's probably best the companies go their own way . 
  de franse economie is een tijdbom en air france is een kleine tijdbom . '' ` france is a sort of greece but bigger . 
  the french ecnomy is a time bomb and air france is a small time bomb ' . 
  we feel like the morocans of the dutch . 
  you can make good profits and cut away 30 % of the personnel but the work load eventually comes on our shoulders . ', 
  ` the french do n't know how to build a profitable company . 
  while klm comes with enormous improvements in productivity . 
  the french pilots almost strike the company to its end . ', 
  one of the french labour unions is literally speaking of ` war ' against the ` klm ` ers ' . ', 
  this does n't like a healthy venture at all anymore . 
   among the petty grievances , there is irritation that a klm employee working in paris is charged $ 10 for lunch in the canteen , while an air france colleague pays only $ 4 . 
  that 's nice . 
  well then we disagree , i think it should be reversed . 
  green = good , red = bad , no alcohol behind the wheel = good , alcohol behind the wheel = bad . 
  though other laws also help , because 0,051 g/dl in the netherlands is 360 euro . 
  so people do n't tend to test fate . 
  odd choice of colours , is the map made by an alcoholic ? 
  this is mostly bullshit though . 
  a modern mbt is near indestructible , and as such one of the most powerful weaponsystems on the battlefield . 
  there 's been a british challenger 2 that got hit by 70 rpg 's , yes you read that right , 70 rpg 's , and it kept on rolling . 
  another got hit by 14 rpg 's and an anti-tank missile , it was ready for the next battle within hours . 
  they 're not our tanks , so that would probably be 0 . 
   defending against nato aggression . 
  so we have zero . 
  that 's accurate right ? 
  that is sufficient for the motion , however to adopt it ;  2 . 
  the european council , ** acting by unanimity ** on a proposal by one third of the member states or by the european commission and after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 after inviting the member state in question to submit its observations . 
  and only then ;  3 . 
  ** where a determination under paragraph 2 has been made ** , the council , acting by a qualified majority , may decide to suspend certain of the rights deriving from the application of the treaties to the member state in question , including the voting rights of the representative of the government of that member state in the council . 
  in doing so , the council shall take into account the possible consequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons . 
  the british did nothing wrong , they defended their islands as is their full right . 
  i 'm not british . 
   what is there to support ? 
  it 's a bit late to be asking for that , nothing for you anymore . 
  it worked out as it did , and as such it will be remembered . 
  in the end it 's always the same countries you can rely on , and i give credit where credit is due . 
   lol well this is what people use when forecasting . 
  people do n't forecast based on targets . 
   they do n't just pull number from thin air . 
  so why would you ? 
  i do n't care what the ecb inflation target is , i only care about what they actually achieve , which has been way below 2 % for some time now . 
   no it just means they have nothing to lose . 
  sure you guys only think about yourself , i never tried to suggest otherwise . 
  it was only 298 innocent people after all , german business interests must go on . 
  i already explained that in my initial reply why it 's better europe remains weak and divided , as this sort of egocentrist moral bankruptcy is not something a society should want to commit to . 
  inflation is sub 1 % , they 're not ever reaching 50 % debt to gdp unless they cut the deficit to around 0,5 % soon . 
  the next crisis will happen way before they reach that level .
