   nor does the us . 
  they [ do . 
  ] ( https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/21/supreme-court-us-mexico-border-shooting/98194778/ )  this is n't a thing either . 
  that they do [ too . 
  ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/us/patrol-heavily-armed-civilian-vigilantes-arizonas-border-mexico/story?id=45201990 ), 
  we also do n't have a cap on immigrants , unlike the us . 
  and we can not and do not deport people with such ease as the us , nor do we arrest them when we find them , or shoot them when they cross the border , not even our vigilante citizens do that unlike the us . 
  we also do n't put caps on individual countries like the us , nor do we refuse visa 's from countries with a certain religion . 
  an american immigration policy is basically what the far right here wants . 
   and we have relatively lax immigration policies hmm , no you do n't . 
  us immigration policies are far stricter than european . 
  no they brought factories and technology , now finns only [ clean toilets .

  or stroking a cat against its hairs for that matter . 
   the `` equivalent '' of the nazis ? 
  well actually they turned out worse than the nazi 's , but that was only because they were given more time to do their thing . 
  actually it is , there 's a difference between the state and a private entity . 
  a swimming pool can have female only nights , without getting charged for discrimination . 
  a state can not rule out men from participating in swimming . 
  it was , asians working on ships is the most common thing ever . 
  pretty much every ship that comes outside coastal waters is manned by ` foreigners ' . 
  that only means states ca n't forbid it , but the owner of the gym can . 
  same as the / r/europe mods can remove posts and submissions they do n't approve without being charged with violating freedom of speech . 
   why ? 
  the ussr was the biggest player in the fight against the nazis ... 
  it was also the biggest equivelant of the nazi 's . 
   it seems strange to me that people forget that so often . 
  that tends to happen when you only fight to replace another oppressor . 
  15 just took the plane home , 5 were bribed to request asylum . 
  regardless , it was never their intention to bring them to cyprus . 
  ( why would they even dock in * turkish * cyprus for that ), 
   ` historic value ' if by ` historic value ' you mean brutalist oppression . 
  you did n't ban anything , the gym did , and that is their choice . 
  except it does n't . 
  and now that you 're calling 1.000.000.000 euro nothing and a soviet lifestyle , i 'm afraid you 've reached the end station of pants of retarded . 
  he 's not in jail , neither did he traffick people from sri lanka . 
  they had employees from sri lanka who were supposed to leave the ship in egypt , but the ship was refused in egypt , so it went to the nearest next port on the route , which was cyprus . 
   the ministry accused poland of `` russophobia '' and of `` striving to belittle the ussr 's role as liberator '' . 
  good god these people are delusional . 
  all the more reason to remove them . 
  i think there [ has been ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-dutch_wars ) , with a very sun tzu ending . 
  after a succesful dutch invasion [ of the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glorious_revolution ) , the dutch king/prince was installed on the british throne . 
  the uk at the time being more strategically located , draw many merchants , and thus economic power , from the dutch republic to the uk ending in the demise of the dutch republic and rise of the british empire . 
  the country we had subjugated to our throne was now surpassing us peacefuly , something our predecessors did not cope with well , and eventually ended up in the bankruptcy of the voc . 
  ironically on the subject , the british and french teamed up against the republic , in what we call the ` disaster year ' [ ( 1672 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rampjaar ) . 
  a british fleet , a french army , and a german army , attacked the republic , and although the dutch republic defeated all at the same time , the war was incredibly costly . 
  and also one of the most brutal periods with the notorious [ death of ] ( http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=urn:gvn:rijk03:dagpren_rp-t-00-3506&amp;size=large ) the ` brothers de wit ' , our stadthouder and his brother ( contemporary president if you like ) of the time . 
  ( having neglected the army , the people took their revenge ), 
  do n't mistake germany for europe . 
   it 's going to be really funny if it really happens . 
  it would n't . 
  between germany and the us , most countries would pick the us any day . 
   into a key element of ~ ~ european ~ ~ german energy security . 
  germany is , i sure hope the eu will not . 
  i do n't know what you 're on about , but that is discrimination . 
   okay , but then he will sell a billion dollars worth of goods and go home . 
  this will make computers incredibly expensive and you would n't have one right now . 
   jea , it does n't work like that kid . 
  and for that he may be rich , a billion is enough . 
  i do n't feel entitled to his money , but millions of americans are . 
  you can only divide the cake once , this should be done reasonably . 
   if you 're selling something you created at the market and people want to buy it , why should the government come in and tell you that after the 50th tomato that you 've sold everything goes to the government ? 
  i doubt a tomato is worth 20.000.000 euro a piece . 
  your math seems to be incredibly poor . 
  i prefer patat to be honest . 
  spanish is most common . 
  they do n't innovate , they have employees who innovate , and these will still want to innovate . 
  that 's nice and all , but it 's money they should n't have . 
  there should obviously be differences between rich and poor people , however nobody deserves to have 50 billion euro , let alone 5 billion . 
  if he had 1 billion euro , he could live 1000 western middle class lives , is n't that enough reward for success ? 
  where does the more stop ? 
  when he can build a stairs to the moon if he would withdraw it all in dollar biljets ? 
  what 's the point ? 
  it 's ridiculous . 
   it must be some belgian pyromaniac taking revenge on us for antwerp * en * . 
  / s oh that , well that was all in good jest at the time , i think the flemish understand it . 
  you do not pronounce r 's ? 
  you 're in for a treat then , [ try ours . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/7c8iwl2pnlq?t=1m9s ), 
  that explains the desire to split up poland . 
  gabriel-lavrov pact then ? 
  did you just tear out of your trousers ? 
  federalization , ever closer union , contineous integration , that basically . 
   can we get anything north of the ejder river ** back ** ? 
  sure , [ sure ] ( http://imgur.com/cwwpqye ) , there 's enough for everybody . 
  he meant specifically in the contested part . 
  pretty sure there 's no drilling going on there , it 's also a protected zone . 
  how on gods green earth did that look like a comparison to you . 
  you did n't , you just made up a story around it . 
   no , she did n't say she wanted political islam in europe , she did . 
   `` i am not afraid to say that political islam should be part of the picture . 
  religion plays a role in politics -- not always for good , not always for bad . 
  religion can be part of the process . 
  what makes the difference is whether the process is democratic or not . '', 
  they [ do actually ] ( http://www.ems-eems.nl/typo3temp/fl_realurl_image/vertragsgebiet-nl-gr-ve.jpg ) it 's been a contested border with germany for very long , the netherlands wants a median line , germany wants all . 
  it 's been temporarily solved by agreeing with a zone that is controlled by both states . 
  still a triviality and nonsensical debate , just put a median line there . 
  i 'm okay with that , as long as we get the northern part of the rhineland , about 1/3rd will do . 
  you may have ze rest . 
  she wants political islam to be part of europe , as is noted in the second quote .
