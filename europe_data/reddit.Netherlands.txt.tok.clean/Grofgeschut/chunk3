  specifically * political * is how she put it . 
  now one may be forgiven for saying ` islam should be part of europe ' , but ` political ' adds a whole different level of insanity . 
  the full speech [ can be read here ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/6332_en ) . 
  mogherini specifically graduated in france because italian universities did not accept her thesis , as it was based on the political islam . 
   ' i graduated two years before 9/11 and it was hard at that time to find a professor who would accept that political islam could be the subject for a dissertation in political science . 
  italy has a great university system , but i had to go to france with the erasmus programme to find someone who would consider islam as a topic not for history , or literature , or cultural studies thesis , but for political science . ', 
  -----  ` for this reason i am not afraid to say that political islam should be part of the picture.religion plays a role in politics -- not always for good , not always for bad . 
  religion can be part of the process . 
  what makes the difference is whether the process is democratic or not . 
  that is what matters to us , the key point . ', 
   federica mogerhini i suppose in order to achieve her desires for political islam in europe through democratic means she 'll need voters , could explain a lot . 
  it 's all over the news [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.nu.nl/buitenland/4861869/twee-doden-bij-schietpartij-in-discotheek-konstanz.html ) supposedly it was a machine gun , one of the wounded ( and perhaps deceased ? ), 
  is the guard that tried to asssault the attacker ( s ) . 
   i mean , if that 's the case , i would rather keep my money in a mattress . 
  it 's my money , after all . 
  that 's exactly why they introduced the deposit insurance . 
   what do you want ? 
  one referendum to vote , a referendum to commit or not to commit to a superstate . 
   and if its outcome is n't `` out '' , there wo n't be any other referedum ? 
  or should there be a waiting period ? 
  we 're not going to rule out referendums . 
  if subsequent generations want one , they should have one . 
  there 's nothing funny about being a nazi , so you wo n't see me laugh at your attempts of humor , nor the revisionism . 
  buying goods you know are stolen to sell them to others is illegal as well . 
   never heard of this before though the government suspended requests for the remainder since 1998 , the cda still talked about it continuing in 2014 though . 
   does every generation get to vote ? 
  there 's no reason nor precedent why that would be the case . 
   should we limit all memberships to 10 years and then ask for a new vote , and if people reject membership , undo everything that has been done ? 
  membership should only be limited to the relevant article of departure from the eu . 
  this referendum would be none of your or any other countries ' business . 
  other countries can decide for their own . 
   sure . 
  but what 's the etymology of ` duits ' ( in the sense of ` dutch ' ) then ? 
   it comes from the old west-germanic word of ` diut ' meaning ` people ' . 
  --  any way you look at it , it 's german ( s ) all the way down :3 if you 're a nationalist german then that 's your cake , not mine . 
  so the referendum would not impair it ? 
  because that 's how the news was brought here . 
  for [ example ] ( http://www.nu.nl/politiek/3941277/zwitsers-stemmen-nederland-geroofd-goud.html ) ` swiss vote over dutch stolen gold ' , [ or ] ( http://www.ad.nl/buitenland/zwitsers-stemmen-over-nederlands-goud~a4491e88/ ) ` swiss vote over dutch gold ' . 
  it also stated gold bullion may not leave switzerland anymore . 
  i was mistaken , the referendum was the ` rettet unser schweizer gold ' however it was rejected , i thought it passed . 
  since 1998 there have been no plans on bringing the remainder of the gold back though , there 's about 70 ton remaining . 
  good on you . 
  somewhere along the line i feel like we should have a vote as well . 
  i do n't think it is up to politicians to give the country away to someone else without the people 's direct consent . 
  luxemburg is part of the ` nederlanden ' or low lands . 
   until resistance is futile . 
  sounds like something people would want to be part of . 
  i do n't find nazi 's funny , sorry . 
   benelux ) are willing to move forward with more integration between them , that is not true . 
  both the dutch public and finally politicians as well have their stomach full of ` integration ' in the eu . 
  the public has never been in support of eu integration , but years back the politicians were . 
  however the governing party ( the largest party ) wants less eu interference and less eu rules , and an eu focussed on a common market alone . 
  the second biggest party is the pvv , and the third biggest party wants the eu to revert back to its core tasks only . 
  belgium is very pro-eu , so perhaps it could be germany-france-belgium . 
  van duitsen bloed in the anthem means ` of dutch blood ' . 
  no thanks . 
  nobody knows that the uk and netherlands were at war until 1986 , when a peacetreaty was [ signed ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/scilly-eilanden ) . 
  it 's called the ' 350 years war ' ( 1651-1986 ), 
  you have tripwire forces anyway . 
  there 's canadian , german , american , british , dutch , spanish troops in the baltics at the moment . 
  if an attack on the baltics wo n't ` trigger ' people , then surely the death of their soldiers will . 
  we were/are always very war averse as well , just look how quickly that changed with mh17 . 
  plenty of people were calling for joining the war in ukraine , and the preparations were being made to do so . 
  it was n't only the jews they stole [ from . 
  ] ( https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/koos-jansen/guest-post-guilty-gold/ ) the swiss made the last payment as late as 1998 , and then in a referendum decided they would call it a day , leaving the other half to be laundered with tanks apparently . 
  makes sense , though ` pays-bas ' is actually a translation . 
  it is true it is based on ` de lage landen ' ( the low lands , ` les pays-bas ' ) however nederland means the same ( neder is low/down , land = land ) . 
  the only exception is that france still uses the plural form , and while our official name is ` koninkrijk der nederlanden ' ( plural ) we only use singular , because belgium is also part of the historic ` low lands ' so saying it in plural would/could imply we would claim belgium/luxemburg again . 
  ` nederlanden ' ( - en is plural ) means belgium and luxemburg as well . 
  well this particular video is an american demonstration from 1953 , they were n't that far yet then as they 're now . 
  the americans used to have a lot of these nuclear artilery shells stored in the netherlands in their former base at havelte . 
  as well as the notorious ` lance ' missiles ' . 
  interesting , is there any reason why ? 
  groen is dutch for green , and land , albeit pronounced differently , means ` land ' . 
  but in french groen/green is vert , unless my french classes are failing me . 
   in the second anglo-dutch war , denmark participated side by side with the dutch empire against the kingdom of england , from 4 march 1665 until 31 july 1667 . 
  the war ended in a dutch victory , and the treaty of breda was signed . 
  they are long forgiven for their trespasses . 
  [ enjoy the firework ] ( https://youtu.be/xt5jo7azztw?t=31s ) . 
  it 's only 14kt , about 2/3rd of nagasaki . 
   groenland a french flaired person using the dutch word for greenland . 
  what 's happening here . 
  neither is turkey , it 's still included . 
  true , but not with tropical climate . 
  ah yes , the battle against malaysia airlines , it resulted in a decisive defeat of the coalition airforce . 
  such glorious russian forces , they did n't lose a single soldier . 
  i bet russian children will be singing songs of those hero 's of the people for many generations to come . 
  10 % are active russian soldiers . 
  if you include the ` resigned ' russian soldiers and the private militias and ` volunteers ' from the caucasus and other parts of russia it 's closer to 90 % russians . 
   the dnr leader for example always stresses how he 's ukrainian . 
  russia replaced borodai exactly because zakarachenko was a ukrainian . 
  at first they could n't find a ukrainian henchman to keep up pretences , in 2014 they finally managed to recruit a local low-life though . 
  i know , just kidding . 
  it 's mostly limited to certain industries these days , either in the national interest/security ( like this one , being a defense contractor ) or in cases where the market ca n't really function . 
  ( for example railways ) and of course in cases where ` important ' companies go bankrupt , like the banks . 
  ( some banks are still partially state-owned i think , abn amro at least still is ( 61 % ) . 
   this was an example and it is not helpful to the discussion to leave the level of the example to the level of practicality . 
  it 's quite a poor comparison if it is n't true , is n't it ? 
   broader speaking if we abandon the principal of proportionality a law could be made that punishes jaywalking with life in prison , detention seems like a poportional response to illegal s who have ignored requests to leave the country .
