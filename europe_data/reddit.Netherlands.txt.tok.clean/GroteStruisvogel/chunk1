   he also did n't use the word `` fucking '' , it 's more like `` shit '' . 
  those are alike ? 
  that could cause some confusion . 
  that has n't been made clear yet . 
  except for the draft , nothing new really . 
  a lot of my teachers in school were ex-military . 
  bragging about my counterstrike kill-streak just does n't feel the same when i 'm standing next to an ex-commando . . 
  like i said , the regulations are getting stricter . 
  but to speak of a `` government crackdown '' and a `` war '' goes a bit far . 
  it is more opstelen 's personal crusade . 
  well , he was but then the law got changed . 
  no coffeeshops in a 350 metre radius around a school is bullshit anyway . 
  when i was in highschool i always took the metro to the coffeeshop :p, 
  very bad tourists , together with the russians . 
  regulations are getting stricter . 
  war on weed ?
