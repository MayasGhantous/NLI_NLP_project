  i think they have been driving in the netherlands for over a decade now but it is still pretty cool . 
  [ and they are hideous . 
  ] ( http://www.mp-produktie.nl/images%20gvb-bussen/gvb-bussen-75.jpg ), 
  i do n't know how to translate it , but it was a malfunction in one of those little buildings you see in neighbourhoods that have those electrical warning signs all over . 
  just like last time , only then two of them failed simultaniously . 
  the poll litterally said that the remaining percentage filled in `` neutral '' as what they thought of the eu . 
  ** the netherlands ** * wubbo ockels passed away today . 
  ockels was the first dutch person in space , and after that a professor in `` aerospace sustainable engineering and technology '' . 
  ockels reached the age of 68 years . 
  edit : the day before he died he gave an interview , he said ; afraid to die ? 
  absolutely not . 
  i am afraid to suffocate though . 
  thats why i myself decide when it 's time . 
  because you do know it 's over , right ? 
  i have everything taken care of , even my gravestone . 
  and you know what 's going to be written on it ? 
  ` my time stands still ' . 
  i have had a wonderfull existence , a super life . 
  but it is horrible for joos ( his wife ) and the kids . 
  that 's the heaviest burden on my soul . . * another power-outage in amsterdam causing the area around the central station to be without power for about an hour . 
  this is the second large power-outage in a short time . 
  a couple of weeks ago most of south-amsterdam was without power for a while . 
  * two of our apache helicopters arrived in mali to support our troops stationed there . 
  * saudi arabia sanctioned the netherlands because of the geert wilders anti-islam thing going on here . 
  i do n't anybody really cared that much about the sanctions . 
  the attitude about this is mostly ; look who is talking . 
  saudi arabia is a nation that does n't allow women to drive and persecutes people who do n't believe in islam . 
  * a poll showed that only 31 % of the dutch people have a ( moderate ) positive view of the eu . 
  27 % have a ( moderate ) negative view of the eu . 
  than what do you propose we do to `` not ignore '' it ? 
  how does the west defy the will of those glorious beards ? 
  they can have their union . 
  put some of the - stan countries in there . 
  maybe belarus , a bit of transnistria here and there . 
  it would be a glorious economic powerhouse rivalling the west !, 
  at least i have a glow in the dark dick for a year . 
  well , i live in an apartment with an identical one across the street . 
  everyone went to their balcony to see what 's going on . 
  i think that is why these guys panicked so badly , suddenly everyone was looking at them . 
  russia can suck my dick . 
  the fact that you can name the frisian people on reddit actually kind of confirms my joke . 
  and they are probably going to be a real dick about it . 
  nice , a conversation between the two only people in frisia with internet . 
  emigration is forbidden in eritrea , so they saw the change to flee wen they went to uganda . 
  one time i was watching tv with my parents , and on the parking lot beneath our apartment some idiots emptied a machine gun on a car . 
  at first i thought i heard firecrackers . 
  but then i was like , how the hell do you light up firecrackers so fast ? 
  then my dad said ; those are bullets !, 
  and we ran to the balcony and we saw two panicked guys starting up a scooter , crashing into a pole , and then picking up the scooter again and driving away . 
  later a police helicopter found them trying to get rid of the scooter . 
  i do n't know if it 's just me , or that accidents with trams occur way more often . . 
  just clicked on a swastika the moment my brother walks in . . 
  when it comes to fascism germany is a `` special case '', 
  you three punched that putinbot out of the arena , well done !, 
  someone forgot to tell iceland and denmark that they had to keep their flag a bit subtle . 
  and the romanian one looks like it was designed by a child . 
   a german who wrote ` bin laden ' on a bank transfer form was added to the national bank 's terror blacklist for 10 years aber ich bin laden !, 
  ** the netherlands ** * we got second place in the eurovision songfestival with a beautifull song . 
  beardlady won , and i 'm not sad about that . 
  hello putin :-) * the national soccer team of eritrea , that dissapeared in uganda . 
  appeared in the small city of gorinchem . 
  the team now lives in small groups in seperate houses and according to the newspaper had to get used to the windy and rainy weather but were quoted saying `` i love holland '' * in amsterdam a tram derailed , and destroyed more than 10 cars . 
  [ link with pics ] ( http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/127247/ontspoorde-tram-richt-chaos-aan ) * in utrecht a 24-year old female cyclist died after getting hit by a tram and dragged along . 
  * our military have been told that they are not allowed to accept the russian st.joris-ribbon during the russian wwii memorial in leusden . 
  * a small storm appeared suddenly , [ causing stormdamage . 
  ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/645956-schade-en-overlast-door-onweer.html ) it was a windy day , and in the evening a big dark cloud of doom appeared . 
  and shortly after all hell broke loose and the furniture on my balcony started flying around . 
  [ also this picture of a rainbow taken from a police helicopter shortly after the storm . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/depolitieheli/status/464855215427321856/photo/1/large ) * a russian carrier fleet moved close to the netherlands through the north sea and our , [ and the british ] ( http://content.nos.nl/data/image/xxl/2014/05/09/645631.jpg ) , navy got dispatched to follow it . 
  * on the museumplein in amsterdam an `` exercise '' of the dutch military police went completely wrong . 
  neither the public or the regular police was informed when someone suddenly got shot at with rubber bullets from a car . 
  people started to panic and running . 
  the major was furious saying that ; if the regular police was at the scene they might have actually started a real firefight . 
  same thing happened last year , when the exercise included people shooting in the vondelpark . 
  * the police arrested two russians and someone from armenia because they were driving in reverse over the highway and because they were very stoned . 
   our trains suck as well . 
  that 's good , keeps the railroads clean . 
  russian psychiatrists are now working overtime . 
  austria is higher :'(, 
  ow sigh how about another country ? 
  i heard luxembourg is really nice around this time a year . 
  seriously . . against a firearm ? 
  allright here we go !, 
  * cleans his rifle *, 
  north-brabant best brabant !, 
  middle-south ? 
  you mean true brabant ? 
  aaaaahahahahahaha made my day !, 
  it does make the work of the immigration officers a whole lot easier . 
  calling everything european fascist and driving away in a german car . 
  just russian things . 
   from democracy to dictatorship coming from russia , i would be laughing if this situation was n't so sad . 
  ** the netherlands . 
  ** * for some reason half the country hates amsterdam and wishes for it to be returned to the sea . 
  * we actually enjoy scaring tourists when they try cycling . 
  * for the same reason we enjoy scaring tourists when we are cycling and they are walking . 
  * you know that snacks that you can pull out of a paywall at the febo ? 
  do n't ask what 's in them . 
  just do n't . 
  nice job replying to a 3 month old comment .
