  was n't that picture taken after they switched from driving on the left to driving on the right ? 
  because the eu is n't as perfect as it should be . 
  i 'm pro-eu . . but let it be in a more , democratic way . 
  * [ there are plans to make the muntplein in the centre of amsterdam car-free . 
  `` group project '', 
   the nation-wide strike of train & trainstation cleaners continues . 
  the ns has rallied some of their office workers to clear some of the mess in and around the trains . 
  passengers have also been asked to not leave their rubbish behind . 
  you never notice how much of a mess people make until the cleaners go on strike . 
  [ these trains turned disgusting . 
  [ no , this is a sodom show .

  ah , right . 
  i must go to sleep . . 
  tanks ? 
  i was aiming at the fact that the european south is more religious than the european north . 
  and that the same applies in the us . 
  and this is n't a problem although it affects the outcome of this survey . 
  but like i said , fuck it . 
  it was too far fetched anyway and i 'm not in the mood for some deep discussion right now . 
  allright you know what fuck it . 
  gips maybe ? 
  not really , you americans just made self-hate a sport . 
  every country has a few nutjobs but in general americans are just as open as europeans . 
  is that a dutch or a frisian dialect ? 
  would i , as an amsterdammer , understand these people ? 
  a friend of mine comes from the achterhoek , i ca n't understand his father either . 
  all i can do is nod , smile and pretend i know what he is talking about . 
  i myself have a very strong amsterdam accent , the only thing dutch people ca n't understand about that is why i would do such a thing to our language . 
  i must find my way to ostrich mt. 
  north and defeat the evil gamekeeper that guards it !, 
  stop making provocative remarks !, 
  ~ ~ the f\u00fchrer ~ ~ putin does n't like it . 
  never forget . 
  orange stronk !, 
   that stock photo girl that is everywhere is in the site you linked . 
  if you scroll down a bit you see good girl gina . 
   honour killing is how we say it . 
  ah ok , i did n't know how to translate it properly so i just translated it litterally :p but i 'm not changing it back because there were n't 500 murders but 500 cases of revenge . 
  this also includes rape and harresment . 
  [ yes yes , a very charming accent .

  i visit prague regularly , and there are a few things i noticed about the czech people . 
  they really do n't like their communist past , but it had an impact on their lives in the way that they do n't really like to be different . 
  do n't get me wrong , but czechs often wear the same kind of clothes . 
  they drive the same skoda cars , and everyone has a little second house were they go to in the weekends . . so much people go there that in the weekends the streets of prague are almost empty . 
  i did n't come up with this myself , a friend of mine who moved to prague told me this and i noticed the trend as well . 
  furthermore , even if they do n't know how to speak english they are always very curious and friendly . 
  and the beer , the beer !, 
  i bring truckloads back home . 
  you crossed the fucking line there !, 
   another fucking giraffe died . 
  link . 
  goddamnit denmark stop trying to have a zoo it 's not your thing !, 
  with it 's own train-station . 
  ** the netherlands ** * yesterday was kingsday , today the streets are full of hangover people . 
  it 's like a zombie-movie here . 
  * a test with lines on the side on the road that glow in the dark failed . 
  they do n't shine bright enough and now the project goes back to the designer-table to get improved . 
  * a driving-school car hit a scooter and drove away from the accident ( wtf ) * last year there were 500 cases of `` honour-revenge '' ... i do n't quite know the english word . 
  this is what happens when the family of a muslim does n't agree with their daughters lifestyle , in 17 of these cases this ended in murder . 
  interesting to note that there are now more cases of honour-revenge than of deadly car accidents in the netherlands . 
  either our roads are getting real safe or . . * two f16 's had to take off to intercept a russian `` bear '' aircraft over the northsea . 
   drunk ( especially in amsterdam they are the worst ) not only that , we all endure the delight of drunken english piss odour in the alleyways . 
   the dutch themselves however sound like they were raised in klingon and then tried to emulate the flemish . 
  flemish sounds like they lost their testicals at a young age . 
   ~ ~ at around 35 . ~ ~ exactly at 35 , overnight . 
  that 's the thing with eastern european women . 
  either they are beautifull or they look like cthulu . 
  there is no grey area in between . 
  how about the philosophers that kickstarted the enlightment ? 
  that seems like a very , very important part of european history to me . 
  so small i did n't know it existed and just read about it for the first time . 
  i 'm getting old , here i was thinking . . that was n't so long ago . . 
  it 's been 4 years . 
  there , there finland . 
  it 's allright . 
  at least your women are of splendid quality . 
  as workers , mostly , but also as drunk drivers causing accidents . 
  especially the truck-drivers . 
  i 'm sorry poles , but if your license plates keep popping up in the news when somebody drove through a house or in a ditch these stereotypes come quickly . 
  wow , i already had you tagged as `` frisian extremist '', 
  i agree with you at some point , but i see pedophilia as a dangerous disease . 
  and the people who suffer from it need some serious professonial help . 
  having a club that glorifies wrong behaviour from these people is n't helping in their process of staying the fuck away from children . 
  i think the freedom of speech is an important asset of our society , but encouraging dangerous behaviour ( like pro-ana or suicide-assistance sites ) should be act upon carefully . 
  huh ? 
  it 's called the * right * side of the road . 
  ** the netherlands ** * a 16-year old girl fell 6-stories from an appartment building in rotterdam . 
  she is heavily injured but survived , initially the media reported that prior to the incident there was a fight in the house but the police later said that it was just an accident . 
  * the court said that the pedophile-group martijn is illegal . 
  * in amstelveen a cow escaped and got eventually shot down when the cow walked in a children-rich neighbourhood . 
  [ here a video of the fire department chasing the poor animal . 
  ] ( http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/6594040/0f4144f1/boe_onstapte_koe_in_amstelveen.html ) * a girl tweeted a threat to american airlines and got arrested . 
  i 'm not going too far into this , she was just too stupid to remain calm . 
  * there is a still ongoing fire on the veluwe nature reserve , the biggest since '76, 
  we will crush luxembourg to protect our flag !, 
  ok , i do n't know how to properly say the word for it in english . 
  i ment the thing that you mock another country etc. 
  i was already thinking , are the hostilities a thing of the past now ?
