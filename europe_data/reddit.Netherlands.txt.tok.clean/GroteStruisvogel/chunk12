  i mean , the rivalry will always be there , but ca n't you two just be friends ? 
   i hope so , the news is getting a bit boring . 
  so you can experience the news in a trench while your friends intestines are spread across the tundra ? 
  third world just means a non-ally of us or the ussr , so ukraine is a third-world country right now . 
  over time it was used for poor countries . 
   when i visit those i am an alien in my own country . 
  i 've heard this a couple of times before , but it is n't that bad . 
  maybe in limburg or something , but the rural area 's are n't that vastly different . 
  might be just because i rarely ever go east of lelystad but still . . 
  and they lack the creativity to come up with their own flag . 
   not punishable . 
  how did you dare to come from eternalwaristan to our netherlands ? 
  we have a new policy , we wo n't send you back to your country anymore . 
  ooooh noooo ... you have to endure our terrible jail now !, 
  how you like that ? 
  * three employees of a fish-stand in almere suffered severe burn-wounds after their fish-stand exploded . 
  [ source with pics ( dutch ) ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/632346-viskraam-ontploft-vijf-gewonden.html ) * wednesday a russian aircraft made a reconnaissance patrol over the netherlands and belgium , and was allowed to do so because of a treaty that allows these patrols each others territories . 
  [ source ( dutch ) ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/630842-rusland-inspecteert-benelux.html ), 
  njet njet njet njet njet njet njet !, 
   russia should drop principles of multiculturalism and tolerance . 
  so who are the `` fascists '' in ukraine again ? 
  surprise anschluss !, 
  * because we care about you . 
  [ wait , i now have a limburg flag ??

  i 'm wondering , which city will be named putingrad ? 
  [ music for on the go .

  thanks to putin . 
  this putin sure gets a lot of things done . 
  also , the new flag shows your new location to were you shall be deported to make sure you do n't mingle with your facist neo-nazi friends . 
  really ? 
  we had 0 months of winter this year . 
  too me it sounds like you might want to give the alps a shot . 
  i just stand next to them and crank up some good ol' cannibal corpse . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxwcginsjhc delightfull . 
  mostly not , the night-sky is completely dark if you look at it . 
  usually the ursa major is visible though , but only the `` coocking-pan '' part of it . 
   the southwestern netherlands and northern belgium appear to be the brightest spot on earth . 
  we 're the enlightened people . 
  they 're supposed too , but nowadays some are fitted with a very bright led-light that makes it impossible for me to determine if it 's a bike or a scooter heading my way . 
  pollution mostly . 
  better ? 
  what is exactly bothering you ? 
  ** the netherlands ** * a jeweler-shop got robbed , and the wife of the owner of the shop shot and killed the two robbers . 
  the police have said that it was an act of self-defence , and the shop-owners were sent home . 
  * in the hague the `` nuclear security summit '' was held , and world-leaders from all over the world came to visit our country . 
  barack obama also made a visit to the rijksmuseum to look at some painting . 
  [ here is his speech . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mayiphiwrs ) the entire nation got a raging boner because we were relevant again and obama said nice things . 
  i got woken up by an entire fleet of blackhawk helicopters , for a minute i thought russia was invading . 
  * three of obama 's agents got a bit too much of amsterdam , they were send back to the states for `` disciplinary reasons '' . 
  washington did n't want to give any details but it has been said the agents got drunk , one of them even unconsious , a day before obama 's visit to the rijksmuseum . 
  * f16 fighters jets intercepted a cargo-plane that ignored the no-fly zone set up because of the summit and send the jet to germany . 
  * some mongoloids pushed a 75-year old of the platform of a train station on purpose because they were fleeing of a scene they caused . 
  the 75-year old is still in the hospital with broken bones . 
  * the motorway a10-west now has a decreased speed limit . . it 's 80 now instead of 100 . 
  which is total bullshit because it is a 6 lane motorway and now everything feels so slow . 
  the government loves to make the speed limit on some roads insanely low because they are idiots . 
  [ like this road which is only 70 ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.341402,4.935221,3a,75y,335.24h,89.4t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s-uqemlpv3vmzwqkeiolo0q!2e0 ) . . or [ this one which has a limit of 50 . 
  ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.511415,5.452242,3a,75y,358.89h,74.44t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s7ku9jbyufmi-suu9ipmp3g!2e0 ) on the other hand it is a smart tactic , everybody ignores these limits and the government gets a lot of money from the fines . 
  * in the province of zeeland , an exhibitionist got caught after 5 years . 
  this guy repeatedly jerked himself off to female cyclists in public . 
  so ... potato 's have sex ? 
  nobody can touch me bro nobody, 
  yes , that 's how i roll . 
  they also tend to use their arms all the time . 
  it 's kind of intimidating to have an argument with an italian or greek . 
  all hail the sacred potato !, 
   edit : you know what , never mind we drink a good deal more beer than sweden and norway , so everything 's okay . 
  yaay for alcoholism !, 
  putin put transistria on the table . 
  ofcourse they are skoda , everything in the czech republic is skoda . 
  everything . 
  though i have to say , those new luxury cars that skoda built seriously match volkswagen quality . 
  a while ago i had the chance to drive the new suburb and i was very pleasantly surprised . 
  a bit the same here in amsterdam , last year i saw the front of the central station for the first time in my life without a construction site in front of it . 
  also in potato europe . 
  that 's just a matter of price . 
  my guess is that swedes can drink as much as you guys can when they get the chance . 
  i once was on a ferry from sweden to some finnish island , and the boat was full of swedes hauling cheap liquor into sweden . 
  there was a maximum you could bring back with you so these people brought their children , parents , grandparents and what not with them and then left the boat with a year 's supply of booze . 
  russia is the `` new europe '' ahahahahahahaha, 
  i 'm a melancholic , beer drinking , butter eating , quiet , emotionally repressed , fag hag who only lives 21 days a year and is n't aware of the term : dining table . 
  seems about right . 
  farao sounds awesomer, 
  * major european producer of synthetic drugs , including ecstasy , and cannabis cultivator ; important gateway for cocaine , heroin , and hashish entering europe ; major source of us-bound ecstasy ; large financial sector vulnerable to money laundering ; significant consumer of ecstasy * that 's true , not many people know it . 
  but our greatest drug-export is n't weed . 
  but xtc ... i heard somewhere the netherlands produces and exports the most xtc in the world . 
  it 's good xtc though . 
  no you are from the farao islands . 
  like seriously , how many people here on reddit are from the farao islands ? 
  in my language farao means pharaoh , so i tagged you as such ;-), 
  it 's dickbutt , just the thing i expected when i opened up this thread . 
  a very good example of this is the `` damrak '' in amsterdam , the road connecting the central station , with the dam and onwards to the munt . 
  this used to be a major waterway in amsterdam , this is also how the dam got it 's name . 
  back then it really was a dam . 
  in the animation the damrak can be seen as the wide canal in the middle of the city running north-south . 
  today a lot of the damrak is dug open again , but this time because they are building a subway . . and are at it for 12 years now . . with 3 more years to go . . 
  on the bright side ; you can never have enough pizza .
