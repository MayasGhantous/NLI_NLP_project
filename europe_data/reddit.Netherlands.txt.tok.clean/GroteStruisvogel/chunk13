   lots of these :  ) ) ) ) ) :'( (   ) ) ) run . 
  but do you know what i mean ? 
  and i 'd rather have earthquackes than russian gas . 
  we once again have a king named william we could send to england to help you guys out . 
  could be worse , they are biased but at least they have interesting articles . 
  it 's not as bad as de telegraaf . 
  why is the volkskrant a terrible newspaper ? 
  oh please not , i want to be able to go to the albert heijn on sunday . . 
  nope , he was super cereal . 
  according to that logic ireland could become very dangerous . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/amsterdam you can google translate it yourself :p, 
  i agree , the whole city ... and country for that matter . . was founded on immigrants and amsterdam is the city with the highest number of different nationalities living in it in the world . 
  not to be netherlands # 1 or something , but when it comes to diversity amsterdam really comes first . 
  when it comes to inhabitants however , with its 800.000 , it comes somewhere way below the list . 
  i also find your username slightly disturbing :p, 
  former plumber turns into a war-machine in less than half a year . 
  i like poland . 
  yes !, 
  make them suffer !, 
  close down their amazon account so they have to walk to the store .

  a bit off topic , but what kind of rifle do you own ?

  i 'm just going to post the part of the speech where he says that here : http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/6589873/ae2c069e/wilders_wil_weer_naar_de_rechtbank.html translated : * wilders * : and the third question is , and i 'm actually not allowed to say it . 
  because people will registre it at the police , and maybe there will be d66-officers ( democratic party ) who will take it to court . 
  but the freedom of speech is important , and we have n't said anything what is not allowed , we have n't said anything that is n't correct . 
  so i ask you : do you want , in this city and in the netherlands , more or fewer moroccans ? 
  * crowd * : fewer !, 
  fewer !, 
  fewer !, 
  then starts a surprise nazi-speech i did n't put in there . 
  talking about hitler , some people call wilders `` witler '' now . . 
   it 's nearly a stereotype in and off itself now that 1st generation immigrants and their countrymen at home are more friendly , accesible and less radical then their offspring especially the younger ones . 
  and this . 
  a lot can be said about moroccans , but the first generation are more kind than most native dutch persons . 
  did n't really work out , nobody really cared for the `` polenmeldpunt '' he is back on the morrocan track now . 
   you have to fight them back op fiets . 
  [ can be done . 
  and while you 're at it , just give your country to us as well .

  i 'm wondering , how many people include the frisian language into their final exam ? 
   i am from a bilingual area ( west-frisia ) and i have the feeling the government is n't doing enough to provide lessons in the local language . 
  seriously ? 
  i did n't even know this was a thing . 
  it is n't * technically * broken . 
  i jumped off a 0.5 metre high platform , accidently landed on a working shoe with my feet on the soft part and my big toe on the metal nose . . and then fell forward . 
  dislocating my big-toe . 
  it hurt soo bad , much worse then when i broke my wrist . 
  thanks !, 
  something to watch while i 'm lying on the couch with a broken foot . 
  like belarus ? 
  so ... is this bad or good ? 
  i do n't really know anything about trans-dniester .

  poland stronk !, 
  you bet these kind of things happen quite often here !, 
  our government is now replacing all the crossings and replacing them with tunnels . 
  because i would n't like a country without free speech/press to be the world power of the world . 
  why would you prefer one of those countries above the us ? 
  well , the us is very corrupt but it is integrated in the system . 
  i 'm talking about the power of coorporations over the political process . 
  but the us is n't corrupt like russia is . 
  i 'd rather have the usa as * the * superpower than china or russia . . or brazil/india for that matter . 
   there is no reason to believe they will . 
  [ that 's right ] ( http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5232093ceab8ea8a68966704/meet-the-pr-firm-that-helped-vladimir-putin-troll-the-entire-country.jpg ), 
  because it is more free , and with less obligations . 
  the laws in western europe are pretty tight . . eastern europe feels more `` loose '' so to say . 
  and i once ate the best hamburger in poland . 
  and poland is the only one in the eu to show off its big fat hairy militaristic balls to russia . 
  but ... just as we are starting to love eastern europe . 
  you abandon us and call us pesky ? 
  you make me sad . 
  back then , you had some strong shit . 
  that last shirtless guy under the blood photo looks like a white carlton . 
  well that is canada . 
  i 'm just saying what i have learned over the years in the netherlands ;-) warm summer usually means wasp-plague . 
  it depends on the weather mostly . 
  last year we had a very cold winter , and this means that a lot of these animals do n't survive and there will be a lot less insects . 
  this winter however , the temperature did n't even went below 0 celcius . 
  usually this means armageddon , the netherlands is a water country . 
  insects love that . 
  ah , i did n't know the word for it . 
  but in dutch we use the same word for christening ships as for baptizing . 
  how about now ?

  why is cyprus stupid ? 
  nice weather , and beautiful nature . 
  want to switch places ? 
  ** the netherlands . 
  ** * it 's nice weather , nature skipt our winter and went straight to the spring . 
  i 'm really starting to like this global warming . 
  since the beginning of our temperature measure it has n't been so hot on 8 march . 
  on the downside , i spotted the first wasp of the year a couple of days ago . . this means that this summer shit will get biblical when it comes to insects . 
  * someone on the run for the police , [ crashed ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/620702-verdachte-botst-met-moszkowicz.html ) into a famous ex-lawyer bram moszkowicz . 
  the last person you want to crash into . 
  it 's quite funny because moszkowicz once played a role in [ this commercial were a similair thing happened .
