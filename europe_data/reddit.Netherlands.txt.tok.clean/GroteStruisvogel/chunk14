  it is now illegal to carry a camera or a protest-banner with you . 
  they also went as far as deploying sam-sites in residential areas . . * the municipiality of amsterdam has conducted a research , which found that . . to everyones surprise . . terraces are more filled when it 's nice weather than terraces in rainy weather . 
  the research took a couple of months . 
  * a shoarma-restaurant exploded in zwolle .

  yes , or we could take this opportunity to make europe a less fossil fuel dependent continent and be better prepared for the future . 
  but look at me and my crazy hippy ideas . 
  awww , i thought we were important for a minute :(, 
  i know it is an eu thing that wo n't be enforced in normal countries . 
  but here they are very strict on that and you 'll see that every dutch website has a banner or pop-up . 
  and weed and prostitution is n't legal . 
  it is n't even legal to build a website with cookies in them without a pop-up warning you of the cookies . 
  so that every dutch website has an annoying pop-up warning you of cookies since every website uses them ... 
  what worked ? 
  the russians do n't have any troops deployed !, 
  those people bought those state of the art ak74m 's with holographic sights at the flea market . 
  that 's true , and i hear a lot more apache 's and chinooks flying over here as well . 
  imagine how people drive when you go more east . 
  eastern europe , no wonder they are so high . . some of them drive like absolute lunatics . 
  especially when it 's a black mercedes , those things will fly past you at ridiculous speeds . 
  one time i was walking from the tram-stop to the side of the road in prague , there was a car approaching but the light on my left was red . . so he had to stop anyway . 
  he fucking put extra gas on it when i crossed the road , and then he made an iiiiiieeeeee brake because of the light . 
  or one time i was walking over a pedestrian crossing and this fucking tourbus comes at me with 80 + , i had to run for my life litterally . 
  and the best part , the police . 
  when they have an excuse to drive fast , they drive fast . 
  when they go around corners you can sometimes even hear their wheels squaking . 
  [ i want one of these . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:wystawa_sprz%c4%99tu_w_cytadeli_2008_%2801%29.jpg ) look at those wheels/tracks !, 
  we do actually , we find it quite funny when you guys are angry . 
  is that still true to this day ? 
  it 's been 70 years , come on !, 
  germany ai n't going to surprise anschluss nobody anymore they are our hole-digging friends . .

  oh i see , damn nos giving me wrong information . . 
  thanks for correcting me . 
  bad luck eta . 
  finally lay down their weapons - world war three breaks out . 
  ** the netherlands ** with everything happening in ukraine local news falls a bit to the background . 
  someone posted this with the title : [ russians occupy crimea ] ( http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/6587294/0201fd62/russen_bezetten_de_krim.html ) ( in dutch crimea = de krim ) made me laugh . 
  * a man ( and women ) hunt on a couple who were suspected of robbery . 
  their photo 's got released in the media and shortly after that someone caught them stealing on a camping site . 
  the couple then shot this guy , who is now in critical condition in the hospital , then proceeded to kidnap an entire family and drive to germany . 
  the manhunt took a couple of days , every time the police got a tip an entire batallion of me ( dutch swat ) searched the village the tip came from . . this happened to a few villages . 
  the car they stole of the family they kidnapped earlier was found in the german city of m\u00fcnster and shortly after the german police arrested the two fuckers in a hotel in ~ ~ k\u00f6ln ~ ~ schwerte . 
  thanks germany !, 
  * a person set himself on fire at the entrance of a supermarket in vlissingen . 
  traumatizing children who were watching it . 
  he survived but is in critical condition in the hospital . 
  * someone defended himself against burglars with hydrochloric acid injuring himself and another burglar . 
  two of three burglars got caught by the police . 
  * [ a trucker forgot to put the handbrake on his truck . 
  the truck rolled away , hit 10 cars , injuring eight people and then proceeded through the wall of a tourist office .

  i don \u00b4 t think people are going to go full on nuclear holocaust over some gas-supply issues . 
  fingers crossed, 
  thank god i just bought an electric heater . 
  i know , the song i 've linked is about the charge of the light brigade , 
   cannon to right of them , cannon to left of them , cannon behind them volley 'd and thunder 'd ; storm 'd at with shot and shell , while horse and hero fell , they that had fought so well came thro ' the jaws of death , back from the mouth of hell , all that was left of them , left of six hundred .

  not much really . 
  i think that if we are talking about one european army , it would have been a whole different thing . 
  but why would he want to restore the old ussr ? 
  is n't russia enough , i mean ... it 's the biggest country in the world !, 
  just keep them nukes at home , ok ? 
  sometimes i see/hear lynx/nh90 or apache/chinook helicopters come over my house . 
  and these are loud ... really fucking loud . 
  there is a lot of military equipment for sale , i myself wear an old jacket of the 11th airmobile . 
  that \u00b4 s it basically , maybe when you go to den helder you see a lot of our navy . 
  ` murica !, 
  you must be german ? 
  i can tell by your lack of sense of humour . 
  i know that but my keyboard does n't have a ringel-s and it looks like a b so i just went with that . 
  i would first like an italian insight before i could give my own opinion . 
  scheisse is the polish kurwa . 
  i once was in a rollercoaster with a german behind me . . sounded a bit funny . 
  * fixed for the german/austrian spellungsgestapo . 
   with all the stereostypes of snobby westerners associated with that area . 
  you 're just jelly . 
   2 giant pandas have been transported from china to belgium ( awww ) is that to help with this ? 
   about 1.2 million belgians in therapy for depression ( 1/10th population ) i like the belgium way of thinking . 
   did i miss anything ? 
  you flair maybe ? 
  then your name should be : overijsseldude :p, 
   no , i live in europe . 
  do n't avoid the statement frisian dude you live in friesland , far away from the civilized world !, 
  war is hell . 
  and he is riding a pink unicorn whilst carrying autistic kittens on his shoulder . 
  i know , i graduated at harvard in advanced reptillian overlord studies . 
   if obama is pro-ukraine repubs will bash him * for being a lizard alien . 
  * ftfy, 
  i do n't know who downvoted you , but i believe you are right . 
  just looking at obama 's body-language gives me the idea that his hands are tied in this conflict . 
  but this has been going on for a while now , the `` fix what we can fix '' attitude seems to be something of the past . 
  since the crisis and the two wars it seems that the international community , not just the us , is very carefull about sticking its nose into other countries problems .
