  so in the video they are saying that the people who are getting shot at in the video ... are on a street leading away from maidan . 
  these dogs are shooting at people who are trying to get away from the protests . 
   oddly it seems that there are flemish men speaking near the camera around the 2:00 mark , almost impossible to make out , something about being helped . 
  or : you ca n't say that he ( directly ) helped him . 
  if you shoot a ricochet into a concrete ground , contrary to what most people think , the bullet will travel in a straight line over the ground . 
  and not upwards . 
  i saw this in an old 50/60 's era police training movie on youtube somewhere , they explained that if someone is hiding behind a car you could shoot the ground in front of the car and the bullets will go under the car . 
  that 's what makes it strange to me that the women is shot in the head . 
  i do n't know , ukraine does n't have foreign fighters coming in like syria nor do i think that will happen . 
  more people should sing songs on the streets !, 
  we held that fucking [ front-li ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsnl6gmgoza ), 
  i something similair like this ended up in the courtroom in my country . 
  and the conclusion was that it is legal to hyperlink . 
  nope , i do n't even want them to ` murica ukraine . 
  before you know it , russian t-90 's are rolling through the german lowlands . 
  nope !, 
  no , turks work hard . 
  i agree with northern africa . 
  the real question is who will be our canada ? 
  step 2 : broadcast it on public television . 
  i would watch !, 
  it 's legal to hyperlink google translated articles is n't it ? 
  so why would n't it be legal to post self-translated articles ? 
  so who is shooting who ? 
  police is shooting civilians , or are the civilians also shooting back with live ammo ? 
  orange really is our national colour . 
   after the eu has fallen apart . 
  you live in a mcdonalds ? 
  me too , i spread it like it was choco-butter . 
  i almost threw up !, 
  do they have tomtom 's for boats in venice ? 
  the danish giraffe holocaust . 
  no ... what i ment was , why would you do the effort of taking in workers from other countries , who do n't speak the same native language as the rest of the company , when they have the same pay as workers from the country the company is in ? 
  there would n't be any financial benefits for all the extra effort . 
  black people live in the same country as the company so you do n't have to do extra effort to integrate them . 
  it surprises me that i have to explain that because its just as obvious as water being wet . . / u/imapeacockletmefly said companies would hire eastern europeans because they are doing a `` good job '' ... maybe in professions that require a lot of knowledge and proffesionalism . . but working in a plantage or a construction site is n't one of those proffesions . 
  he then said that eastern europeans could n't be good in the job he/she is doing according to my post and i replied with that eastern europeans are just as good in their job as western europeans and showed him that his way of debating is polarizing . 
  that 's a stupid argument , it 's like saying ; so if eastern europeans are n't better than natives of a country , they must be not good at all . 
  this is a wrong way of thinking . . all humans are born equally right ? 
  why do you think that ? 
  it 's the pay . . trust me . 
  i 've never heard that one before . 
  well , if they didn \u00b4 t end up with a lower pay there wouldn \u00b4 t be any reason for a company to let a bunch of people who don \u00b4 t speak the language of the country work here . 
  it works the other way around as well . 
  a lot of western european companies outsource a lot of work , mostly it-work or things to do with phones , to eastern europe because the wages are lower . 
   the government seems to be determined to lead germany to a greater political and military role in world http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7fkalyloug, 
  really ? 
  i always get this one :  foreign dude : were are you from ? 
   me : i 'm dutch  foreign dude : deutsch ? 
  well , we could all stand in a circle with our pants down . 
  and jerk the one-eyed snake . 
  that 's it basically . . 
  `` welcome to denmark , we kill giraffes '', 
   his staff and their children to be killed and fed to the lions ( lolwut ? ), 
  this would n't work unless you would really starve the lions . 
  i 'm not saying they would survive , but human meat is n't really tasty . 
  a giraffe , being a herbivore , is much more tasty . 
  what you would get is a bunch of half-eaten bodies with tigers around them . 
  not very child-friendly . 
   a man who , whilst having more than 2 per-mills of alcohol in his blood , let his 8-years-old son drive the car was charged with endangering life . 
  his son caused a traffic accident . 
  [ rmf24.pl ] how considerate of him not to drive intoxicated . 
  though problem solving can get a bit weird while being so drunk . 
  ** the netherlands ** * very windy , very fucking windy . 
  went to work on my bike with an average speed of 3km/h . 
  on the way back i think i could have used the highway :p * [ the volume of music in concerts gets lowered . 
  ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/610818-volume-bij-concerten-omlaag.html ) * in 2013 , the police raided and closed almost 5300 weed-plantations . 
  hidden in empty-houses , powerstations , under highways , at your grandparents place . . everywere . 
  thing is , you can buy weed here and smoke it ( semi ) legally no problem . 
  but when you want to grow more than 5 plants your being a criminal and the police will come to take you and your plants away . 
  this also means that no coffeeshops can buy their weed legally as well . . * on a highway in gouda an otter got run over by a vehicle . 
  the last years there is a rising trend in animals that come back into this country after their species has dissapeared hundreds of years ago , like the otter and the wolf . 
  but the only way we seem to know this is because they usually end up in the grill of a car . 
  * a morrocan immigrant received a lot of death-threats from the muslim community after opening a wine-bar . 
  they think that a muslim should n't serve alcohol . 
  everybody got involved to support her , even the major of rotterdam came to drink wine . 
  [ and now people inside the morrocan communities have started initiatives to support her by coming to drink ( alcohol-free halal ) wine in her wine-bar .

  * old d66-politician els borst has died , and the conditions in which she died are very suspicious . 
  the police is having a huge investigation , and is not letting much info out . 
  though i read in a newspaper that people said her knuckles were damaged and her head was struck with a heavy blow , hard enough to make her nose unrecognisable . 
  [ els borst died at 81 years old .

  the judge accused the trucker of tailgaiting , [ when a traffic jam appeared the trucker needed to brake but hit a small car with the children in front of hit and then drove on into the back of another truck crushing the small car . 
  ] ( http://nos.nl/video/188511-vrouw-en-drie-kinderen-omgekomen-op-a59.html ) at least one of the girls that got killed in that crash lived in my neighbourhood , it was all really sad . 
  people who moved to other eu countries ? 
  some people i know moved to eastern europe for work , mainly the czech republic . 
  on the one hand everybody is glad for them that they found work in another country and the experiences they will get . 
  on the other hand , 2.5 years away from family and friends kind of sucks . 
  at least that guy on the bottom left got a good taste in music . 
  up the irons !, 
  wow , that is very cool !, 
  so i cycled to work and my average speed was 3 km/h on the way back on the other hand i went like 50 or something . 
   you 'd be a lot better off finding people and talking to them you do realize that our english is so good because of the us television programs being broadcasted here , right ? 
  if i did n't grew up watching kenan & kell , the fresh prince or spongebob when my mother already told me `` the third time to go to sleep , now go to sleep or i take that tv with me '' , i would n't be able to talk to you this well . 
  in a few months :  39-year-old matteo renzi accused of corruption etc. 
  too bad that thing they posted those photo \u00b4 s in freezes after watching 2 pictures . 
  these websites nowadays with their fancy-schmanzy-look how much we payed our webdevelopers-websites that are always faulty . . 
  still a lot better than most russian streets though . 
   yet it calls them this sentence in itself is racist .
