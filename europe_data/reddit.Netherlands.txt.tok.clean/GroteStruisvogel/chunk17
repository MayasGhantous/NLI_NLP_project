  it works , despite what those lefties have to say about it .

  the drunk driver got caught .

  no , thats not a combination . 
  it 's more like `` ij '' which replaces the `` y '' , like how our national hero van speijk is called van speyk abroad . 
  i think you ment that . 
  the only word with a `` js '' that i know is the word for ice ( cream ) : ijs . 
  i would love to write my last name here but i do n't because of privacy reasons . 
  but it 's fun to see non-dutch speaking people look confused when they see it . 
  it has both the `` ij '' and a `` sch '' in it . 
  and it 's not like poland has some weird combinations too , i once been to this unspeakable place . 
  someone learned me how to say it but i have to use google to find the proper way to write it down . 
  wtf . 
  like this : fdjsalfj pnjhsdjhs atgjsdhagjdas jbna bvhan dhsag hsdagj . 
  [ that does n't look so good .

  certainly , he was a thousand times better than this wilders who creeps me out . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o0gw39apwe ) ** this country has enough , c'est ca . 
  ** from a former politician fortuyn who basically started the trend the pvv is on now . 
  he was talking about the immigrants that do n't adapt to our western society . 
  i did n't agreed with his political views but he was quite a figure . 
  he dramatically changed the political and cultural landscape in the netherlands . 
  unfortunatly he got shot dead . 
  small detail ; at about 0:43 he says :  ik kan niet anders . 
  ** i ca n't do it different . 
  and i wo n't do it different . 
  then they will kill me . 
  ** and he was right . 
  when `` i '' ( because appearantly i speak for the actions of my country ) tried to withdraw from uruzgan for financial reasons a whole lot of shitstorm came from the us to continue the mission in afghanistan . 
  and so we went back in , to kunduz under a different name . . `` police mission '' . 
  and with the jsf and nsa bullshit i doubt the us is n't the country that pressures other countries for its own interest the most . 
   it 's only when it comes to policy on issues that we disagree sometimes , and even then it 's often valid . 
  no it 's not , especially in the military corner . 
  pressuring countries under a nato agreement to participate in a war the us started for its own interest seems very fucked up to me . 
  i did n't mean it like that . 
  i just assume that when these guys on those forums say they want to vote `` socialist '' , and i assume they wo n't vote for the pvda . . i think they vote sp . 
  i did n't mean to drag the sp through the mud , though it is n't the party i vote for . 
  i think the pvv ties with the sp actually . 
  it 's called national-socialism for a reason , and as you can read a lot of these people votes socialistic . 
  it 's the pvv that has the nationalism and the sp that has the socialism . 
  imagine a coalition between the two . . brrrr . . 
  well , [ when i 'm reading through this stormfront-thread i do n't really get the idea neonazis are a big fan of wilders and the pvv . 
  ] ( http://www.stormfront.org/forum/t711651-6/ ), 
  why do neonazis want to affiliate themselves with an openly pro-israel party ? 
  if you visit the headquarters of the pvv you see one dutch and one israeli flag next to each other . 
  does n't really sound like something neonazis would be interested in . . 
  i thought i read : never get off * on * the bus without thanking the bus driver .

   i know that in holland you learn the 12 provinces also the general region names , like `` achterhoek '' , `` veluwe '' etc. 
  i 've never had to learn the american states , but i finished school very quickly to be honest . 
  i did had to learn all the european countries , the east bloc was a bitch to learn back then . 
  and yet the only place i 'm reading this is here , nothing on the news . . 
  i 'm not a history teacher i do n't know . 
  even the catholics were tolerated as long as they did n't `` openly '' practiced their religion . 
  they had to practice it in `` schuilkerken '' , or `` shelter churches '' . 
  in that time this was very uncommon not to prosecute people with another religion . 
  [ yes , but some say it is only a matter of time until this happens .

   amsterdam , all of noord-holland whoooooooo there ... that 's enough .

  [ i recently had the pleasure to take this skoda for a drive . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0koda_superb#second_generation_.28typ_3t.3b_2008.e2.80.93present.29 ) i would have never thought skoda to build such awesome cars , no bad words about skoda . 
  better example yet ; look at the religious freedom during and after the 80-years war in the netherlands . 
  one of the reasons the netherlands flourished in that era was because of all the people fleeing to the netherlands , afraid to get prosecuted in other countries in europe . 
   the reason we want to keep our dongs is because we would very much like to use them ourselves . 
  besides , what is a man without a dong ? 
  how about ; sunshine in the uk ? 
  when that happens , i 'm building an ark . 
  well then mention it . .

   everything 's flammable right now .

  at least your country has the balls to admit it ... 
  * pussy riot held a conference in amsterdam , and went on to meet our ministre of foreign affairs timmermans . 
  they do n't like the fact that the netherlands is sending a big delegation including our prime ministre en king to the sotsji olympics . 
  * next week a museum about prostitution opens in amsterdam . 
  * in amsterdam starts experimenting with a `` psycholance '' . 
  an ambulance which is specifically aimed at helping `` confused '' people , mostly psychiatric patients . 
  last year the ambulance had to bring 1819 people to the mental emergency clinic and it is viewed as too much of a burden for the regular ambulances . 
  the psycholance was a norwegian idea . 
  * the court ruled that internet providers ziggo and xs4all could lift the blockade of the piratebay . 
  brein , the organisation fighting for internet censorship also needs to pay the costs of the trial which is about 340.000 euro .

  * the military personell deployed at the [ train-hijack at the punt in 1977 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_dutch_train_hostage_crisis ) get a veteran status despite never being deployed abroad . 
  * an aircraft travelling from scandinavia to great brittain made an unplanned landing because of a `` drunken swede throwing with objects '' . 
  the swede got arrested . 
  * a dutch television program aired an interview of a jihad-fighter in syria . 
  the surprising thing about this is , that this guy is an ex-soldier of the dutch military and is now training new recruits for the syrian opposition forces .
