  actually quite interesting to watch . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwua3exa6rw ) * in brabant a v1 rocket from wwii was found . 
  * in amsterdam-noord a guy got shot dead in what was probably an assasination in the criminal sphere , something that is happening more and more the last years . 
  * truckers have decided to close all highways in the busiest morning rushour at of the week at 7 march . 
  i am currently still searching why ... it is n't that clear . . edit : they are protesting because of the unfair advantages of truckers from eastern europe . 
  what they want our government to do about it is unclear . . 
  i 'm just glad you and me will probably never see war in our lifetime . 
  i wish there were more people who could say that . 
  almost every problem in the news has russia and the west opposing each other . 
  i wonder how this will develop over the years . . 
   amsterdam 16 7 9 44.5 amsterdam is n't really representative of the netherlands . 
  some neighbourhoods are way poorer than other parts of the country , while people living in oud zuid are among the wealthiest of the country . 
  i guess this is the same with any capital . 
   they discovered that we 're robots construction robots , right ? 
  i 'll show myself out . . 
   i guess war always looks the same . 
  war never changes . 
   the initial response to the rising was to send a small force of lancers trotting up the middle of o'connel street for a jolly old gander at the bit of a tiff in the post office , do n't you know !, 
  the insurgents opened fire and four of the unfortunate lancers fell dead . 
  suddenly the british were planking it as the scale of the problem dawned on them - and they only had 1,200 men in the city . 
  they called for reinforcements and a gunboat `` the helga '' sailed up the liffey where it proceeded to flatten liberty hall with shell fire , british `` intelligence '' having failed to let them know that this building was completely empty . 
  determined to demonstrate their incompetence to the full , the helga 's guns continued to fire into the city , sometimes with such inaccuracy or lack of concern for the lives of civilians that their own men thought they were being attacked by rebel gunfire and they started shooting at each other !, 
  they also nearly destroyed the viceregal lodge in the phoenix park ( three miles away ! ), 
  after a lot of practice shots , ( 200 buildings destroyed ) the guy working the guns finally found his glasses and proceeded to rain shells down on the gpo .

  wow , slovenia is beautifull !, 
  actually , i might want to go on vacatian there and bring my parents with me like we do each year . 
  is piran interestingly enough to have a vacation there or should we better head for ljubljana ? 
  it 's been a while since we last visited the beaches so i 'm leaning towards piran . 
  i never even knew that , i knew there were bad neighbourhoods but not that it was so bad !, 
  only 30 % thinks its safe to walk in brussels at night , just wow . . 
   and it 's safer overall . 
  hungary is safer than belgium ? 
  til, 
  they should have made those names less confusing . . 
  but seriously , looking at slovenia at the map . 
  these guys got fucked over at the coast , wow !, 
  [ i like places like this . 
  ] ( https://maps.google.nl/?ll=46.649436,23.950195&amp;spn=21.00767,46.538086&amp;t=m&amp;z=5&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=48.794074,21.975517&amp;panoid=lg0s_1umgjuc378ftxhs0a&amp;cbp=12,149.7,,0,-5.52 ), 
  i went there for the first time a few years ago . 
  could n't believe my eyes , i was sitting in a dutch train ... that was going through hills . 
  it was just . . very weird . . 
  the netherlands does n't really have that much nature , only small bits . 
  but there is one part of reclaimed land in the province of flevoland that was unneeded . 
  so it was given back to nature . 
  [ here is a trailer about a movie made about the reserve . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o99ss6k7ru ) too bad this reserve has a huge over-population problem causing a lot of animals to starve . 
  and they do n't show this in the trailer but there are a lot of carcasses laying around . 
  still a beautifull piece of the netherlands though , when you take the train from the randstad to the east , more specifically between almere and lelystad , you have a nice view of the landscape and you can see all the wildlife etc. 
  we will invade belgium with our armoured cows !, 
  only in some regional parlements , there is no muslim party in the nations parlement . 
  there is however the [ pvv ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_for_freedom#political_issues ) which is certainly anti-islamic . 
  [ i google translated a news article for you . 
  ] ( http://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.at5.nl%2fartikelen%2f120147%2fscam-city-gebruikte-nep-zakkenrollers-in-amsterdamse-aflevering&amp;act=url ) even though national geographic still denies it . . 
  i know , not much interesting has happened . 
  and i filtered like 95 % of the more uninteresting news out . 
  but then again , no news is good news . 
  yeah , i do n't even ... that writing is a bit . . 
   except that the world does n't really give two shits what the dutch are doing . 
  same as that the dutch do n't really give a shit about what the prime ministre is doing . 
  hard times . . 
  i wish we could just all be friends . 
  yeah you can forget about that :d, 
  the translatormachine had . 
  appearantly it means `` language '' . 
  my bad , sorry . 
  sae wull th ' scottisch leid become th ' official leid o ' scootlund then ? 
  yeah ... i used a translator for that . . 
   i have n't seen much enthusiasm on / r/europe when it comes to that , but i still think it 's good news . 
  welcome !, 
  enjoy your stay . 
  i prefer snow over a mild winter . 
  i like the atmosphere it gives off , and it makes for an always valid excuse to arrive late at work . 
  ** the netherlands ** * finally !, 
  the winter is setting in , in groningen the first cars spun out and ended up in a ditch because of the snow . 
  [ like this police car . 
  the city earned 166 million this year in total on this . . * a politician from the `` moslim-party '' in zwijndrecht resigned after threats , some people claim these treats came from the anti-moslim party pvv . 
  * some unknown people laid an iron pipe on the railway between lelystad and zwolle . 
  this pipe ended up going through the floor of an intercity train . 
  fortunatly nobody was injured . 
  [ this is a photo of the place the pipe exited the trainfloor . 
  ] ( http://static3.volkskrant.nl/static/photo/2014/18/3/4/20140120075449/media_xl_2052379.jpg ) looks mild , but a lot of people sit on those steps when the train is full so its actually pretty shocking . 
  * two burglars in nijverdal caused a car accident injuring six people . 
  the police already terminated the pursuit becaus of the insane speeds the guys were driving . 
  after that they crashed into an oncoming car while overtaking . 
  [ i provided a link with a video in it taken just after the crash , turn down your volume because you can hear the burglars screaming out in pain and crying . 
  nsfw needless to say . 
  * in the hague a tram collided with another tram and 4 people got lightly injured . 
  * germany acknowledged that there were in fact 4 `` ghetto neighbourhoods '' during the second world war in amsterdam . 
  some jews who did `` voluntary work '' at the time can now claim 2000 euros from a german ghetto-fund . 
  * the government is working on a new project creating super silent asphalt . 
  the so called poro-elastic asphalt should reduce noise levels by 10db . 
  a what ? 
  edit : awww fuck thanks !, 
   road network nope , it 's not your road network . 
  i ca n't even speak to my other passengers when driving in belgium . 
  its absurd . 
  and the fucking ring of antwerp , worst congestion in the world . 
  flagstealers . . 
  and guess which country we are going to reclaim .
