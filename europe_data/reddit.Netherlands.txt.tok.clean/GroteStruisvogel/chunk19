  oh man , when we defeated brazil in the world cup . 
  i raced to the city centre of amsterdam to see all the madness . 
  and madness i saw . 
  maybe we could lure them out ?!, 
  i 'll start : jeeeeeews , jeeeews everywhere . 
  and they are married !, 
  with black people !, 
  whoooooooo, 
  also the ( rather sudden ) withdrawal from afghanistan which the international community got quite pissed about . 
  we need some things to make up for that . 
  i do n't know , i do n't really know polands weather . 
  my guess is , is that it is less influenced by the atlantic ocean and more by the continental climate of the east . 
  the winter is very mild , at least compared to the last few years . 
  and it wo n't get any colder either , at least probably not below freezing point . 
  [ here is the ensemble of the netherlands , every computer calculation about the forecast is a green line and the red line is the outcome with the most chances of becoming reality . 
  ** the netherlands ** * a meteorite was spotted by many people . 
  the comet landed in the north sea . 
  [ here is a dashcam video of the comet . 
  ] ( http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/6581335/65484cf7/megavuurbal_gezien_over_nederland.html ) * the police found the body of an 11-year old boy in a house in amersfoort . 
  they also found his 47-year old mother who was injured . 
  according to the police the father is not a suspect . 
  * in the province of groningen , they will lessen the drilling of gas because of earthquakes . 
  this after large protest against the drilling , in a conference the vice-ministre held a speech against the protesters in which he got so emotional he even started to cry a bit . 
  the decision made costs the country 2,7 billion euro . 
  not something our fragile economy could use right now . 
  * [ in alphen aan de rijn a drug-awereness campaign in a highschool failed after the demonstration-coke got stolen . 
  they still do n't know who stole it .

  no injuries but the entire route was out of service from wednesday till monday .

  [ here in the netherlands we have a special kind of police . 
  ] ( http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/6575221/5fd10bfa/de_politie_komt_naar_je_toe_deze_winter_.html ) also , [ i would advice not to call other people a pancake here .

  dark but funny , i upvoted you . 
  [ we have a whole truckload of satire . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evt986g7lt0 ), 
  yup , they certainly do . 
  `` management '' [ at least we got a funny song out of it :p ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr-jo386cq0 ), 
  this could also be applied to english/french/german / scandinavian/dutch/italian / polish/russian/greek tourists . 
  geenstijl made a link that 's called [ fuck tim kuik ] ( http://www.fucktimkuik.org/ ) that gives instant acces to the pirate bay . 
  tim kuik is the guy who runs the anti-piracy lobby . 
  ofcourse not , how dare you to doubt the trustfullness of our great governments ? 
  the [ 1600/1700/1800 class ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ns_1700_class ) is french , pretty good locomotive . 
  maybe local italian trains , but this was a euronight . 
  i do n't think they would allow that . 
   sachs alleges that obb caused her injuries by negligently moving the train while she attempted to board . 
  i know were i live this would be impossible . 
  a train can not depart unless all the doors are locked and a so called `` green light '' lights up . 
  if one door does n't close fully the train can not depart . 
  in other words ; she is lying . 
  every time ? 
  i have to drive amsterdam - prague and back a few times a year . 
  so i have to pay 200 euros in total for the ride through germany ? 
  someone already opened up a `` netherlands '' post . 
  i removed this one , 
  the city of amsterdam accidently payed 9000 people a total of 188 million euros . 
  people who actually got 155 euro in support now got 15.500 euros . 
  and ofcourse a lot of people spent this money so that they now have money problems because the city is ordering the money back to them . 
  also , the mayor of maastricht cheating on albert verlinde is a quite ironic story given alberts job . 
   in syria they sell beer . 
  yeah , good luck with that !, 
  agreed , taking a shit on the dinner table is always a bad idea !, 
  i think it has something to do with socks . 
  quit stabbing the dragon with him !, 
  this time i see it through the fingers , but next time the turnips are cooked !, 
   also some people do n't even know that amsterdam is our capital but instead think that amsterdam is a seperate country . 
  a lot of people in amsterdam act like that too . 
  for me , going outside the randstad is a lot like going abroad . 
  it 's a secret frisian sport he just gave away : o, 
  nobody chants `` nederland ! '', 
  at footballmatches . 
  it 's always `` holland ! '', 
  how about going past cyclists with 50km/h on a cycle path that 's merely a meter wide . . 
  that is because they are called `` snorscooters '' . 
  basically named after the sound that they make ( snorring ) , but it also means mustache in dutch . 
  i said blue licensed because there are two types of scooters defined by the colour of the plate here . 
  the scooters this article is about are allowed to always use the cycle path . . and they have a blue license plate , instead of a regular yellow one . 
  that would be the exrements of a bat , which happens to be quite valuable among biologic farmers because it is a highly efficient [ fertilizer .

  i thought he just ment the western culture/society/policies in general . 
  for some reason putin turned into a giant hater a while ago . . 
   63 naked people protest in a cage in munich against intensive animal farming pic , nsfw i would have picked another season to do this , getting locked up in an open cage with my bare dick exposed to the december climate is n't my idea of having a good time . 
   putin : russia prevents the movement to chaotic darkness and ofcourse russia is the most well-organized country in the world with the highest standard of living so putin knows what he is talking about !,

  hooray !, 
  [ pabo ? 
  that must be something new , i never had english in kindergarten ... 
  for me it is a lot harder for some reason , especially limburg and the achterhoek . . 
  it 's quite emberassing to go to a store and do n't understand what the person behind the desk is saying while she can understand me just perfectly . . 
  that 's how it works , especially in the cities . 
  you can thank american television . 
  [ get out !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc5njqioprs ), 
  i do n't think fooling a few brits is as evil as trying to exterminate an entire race . 
  sometimes i walk through certain neighbourhoods that convince me otherwise . 
  sometimes the english confuse dutch with german . 
  a fun thing to do is to act super-offended .
