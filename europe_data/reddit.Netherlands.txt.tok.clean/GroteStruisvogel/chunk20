  i 'm really not offended , but it 's fun too watch them excusing and stuff . 
  and every other dutch person i know does this too !, 
  it 's some kind of secret conspiracy against the brits . 
  well then , in order to receive welfare in the netherlands . 
  you must speak dutch . 
  how does that sound ? 
  do n't care , whenever i 'm in belgium my amsterdam accent intensivies heavily to show my dominance over the `` afvalligen '' !!, 
  gggggggggggggggggggggggg !!!, 
  a scandal broke out after the media learned that there was a conversation between our minister of justice and the ( now fired for corruption major of roermond ) which was n't recorded by a telephone tap because of `` technical difficulties '' . 
  [ appearantly there was a power-shortage for 90 minutes while the conversation between the two lasted for 60 minutes . 
  a bit off-topic , but red on top and blue on the bottom is a much better combination . 
  i tell this to anyone visiting our beloved `` tourist-trap '' amsterdam . 
  cities like delft and haarlem are beautifull without all the tourists that are in amsterdam . 
  when i 'm walking over the damrak i ca n't see a single `` not-tourist '' , and the entire area is shaped to sell as much overpriced drugs/sex and souvenirs possible . 
  and there is metal in front of our coast !,

  [ here is an equipment list of the greek army .

  lets say , hypothetically speaking , the euro gets divided between a northern euro and a southern euro . 
  catalonia being in spain will have to deal with the southern euro . 
  while france to the north will implement a ( much stronger ) northern euro . 
  a catalonian independence might mean a northern euro for catalonia too . 
  but because catalonia is stuck with spain they will have to pay with the economically much weaker southern euro . 
  basically meaning spain will drag catalonia much further down . 
  do you think a situation like this could be a recipe for disaster ? 
  but why does catalonia want to be independent ? 
  do you think the public support in catalonia for such an uprising is enough to escalate into an armed conflict ? 
  i was thinking of greece being in the danger-zone because of the combination of the rising of parties like the golden sunrise , a huge military and major economic problems . 
  shall we place bets on which european country is the first to fall into civil war or start an invasion ? 
  to be honest , i think its greece . 
  i got quality weed right here , i do n't care about his :p,

  the hamburger is n't really american . 
  it came from germany , from the city of ... hamburg . 
   new york city was the most common destination for ships traveling from hamburg , and various restaurants in the city began offering the hamburg-style steak in order to attract german sailors . 
  the steak frequently appeared on the menu as a hamburg-style american fillet , or even beefsteak \u00e0 hambourgeoise . 
  this history caused american preparations of minced beef to evoke in european immigrants memories of the port of hamburg and the world they left behind .

  it was a bit confusing excuse me :p, 
  if you were talking to me , it is a bit confusing . 
  the turkish and the morrocans are the biggest groups of immigration in our country since 1970 . 
  yes , and so the practice of a religion is defined by ones culture . 
  culture is a different thing than religion . 
  her grandpa was the mussolini ? 
  true , but that comes down to culture . 
  and religion is a part of a culture , not the whole lot . 
  for example , there are almost no problems with turkish immigrants and they are muslim . 
  while there are many problems with moroccan immigrants who are also muslim . 
  yes , there is . 
  there is , unfortunatly , rape everywere in the world . 
  but it 's not like it is in their culture to rape girls on the streets . . 
  i think what he was referring to , was that immigrants are more prone to criminal behavior than natives . 
  he is right , statistics back this up . 
  but like i said , the cause of this is a number of factors in which the islam is non-existent . 
  were the problems are , you can write whole essays about this and still do n't cover it all , it 's about immigrants feeling viewed as inferior by dutch natives . 
  and sometimes they are right , most of the times it is overdone . 
  wilders is only provoking these views by the dutch about immigrants making the problem worse . 
  not exactly true , i think wilders gets most votes because of his ( fierce ) stand against muslims . 
  what he does n't understand is that the problems with our arabic immigrants is not caused by religion but by their socio-economic upbringing . 
  but that is a whole other story . 
  i just watched 10 minutes of the persconference with le pen and wilders , and this question came up . 
  what wilders basically said was that le pen is the leader of her own party and that he is merely interested in working together with fn to form a stronger anti-eu bond . 
  i disagree , one of our parlements main function is to guard the democratic process in decision making in this country . 
  nobody wants the aivd to spy on us . 
  yet they roll these decisions through the parlement like 80 % of the population agree with them . 
   im surprised this was n't already the case . 
  the thing with the nsa is , is that we do n't have any influence at all over their actions . 
  ofcourse i am against this spionage , but our own government agrees to this and that makes the pill easier to swallow . 
  just went ahead and translated your post ;-) what probably will happen is that the opposition will start screaming that it is wrong and what not to get votes . 
  and when they turn into the coalition next election their opinions will suddenly change in the nsa 's favour . 
  like always . . edit : misread something .

  frisians are the people that live in the northern province of friesland in the netherlands . 
  a very sparsely populated province with a mostly agricultural economy . 
  they speak something that sounds like dutch , but i can not understand . 
  it is appearantly the oldest germanic language in the world that they speak . 
  also , they have a very rich culture different from the netherlands . 
  with their own sports like [ flierjeppen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp32iwoqjnq ) and most of all : ice-skating . 
  when there is a strong winter here , and a canal between 11 villages in friesland completely freezes over . 
  there is the [ `` elfstedentocht '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnm0rzoap0u ) which is the hardest ice-skating match in the world . 
  more so , to the rest of the netherlands . 
  frisians think they have the best province in the netherlands . 
  this competition is mostly a laugh , there arent any real tensions . 
  so the frisians are n't a separist group in the first place although it may seem like so . 
  the frisians invaded the north of north-holland , groningen and a part of germany !, 
  i always knew they were evil !!, 
  beware of the frisian empire !,
