  may , but a few months ago i went to a mcdonalds in aachen . 
  none of the employees spoke english and they were all under 30 . 
  you mean an abundancy of cows , families with 10 + children and unemployment brings impeccable spoken english ? 
  til, 
  if you look at germany , it is ranked up pretty high . 
  but whenever i go to germany nobody seems to speak english . 
  also youre very own sweden . 
  in the cities their english is quite good . 
  but when you drive up north nobody can speak english . 
  i did n't just piss you off did i ? 
  just be a bit carefull with the germans , allright ? 
  wow , thats what i call living !, 
  come to the netherlands , with the exception of some immigrants , nobody would think less of you or would disrespect you because your gay . 
  wow , i never thought i would see someone from the farao islands !, 
  what are you people called ? 
  and what is there to do on that island ? 
  exactly , she does n't have a slightest clue what she is talking about . 
  it 's like saying to americans they should cancel christmas , its insane !, 
  [ zwarte piet unchained , an upcoming blockbuster movie in the netherlands . 
   as your country consistently offers asylum to large amounts of dark-skinned refugees . 
  that used to be true , but nowadays the netherlands has a very strict immigration policy . 
  for example , if you are a refugee you better be in a whole lot of trouble before the netherlands makes you a citizen . 
  and while the refugees citizens request is looked at ( which takes a looong time ) the refugee gets trown in a special jail . 
  [ this is the zwarte piet the whole thing is about ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwarte_piet ) , appearantly people find it racist to dress up black and make children laugh . 
  if you ask most black people on the street what they think about zwarte piet nobody has any problem with it . 
  but since 24 people started comparing zwarte piet to the holocaust last week this whole debate got fired up again . 
  even the prime minister had a say in it : `` zwarte piet is black ; i ca n't change that . '', 
  [ i hope this will help .

  russians are fun , as long as they do n't get into cars . 
  last week someone on the a10 cut me off in a maniac way , he went from the exit-lane all the way to the left , barely missing the guardrail seperating the roads , and he went all the way to the most left lane . 
  cutting of everyone on the busy road . 
  i thought , is he having a stroke or something . 
  then i saw he had a russian license plate ... 
  this story sucks , i feel for you and i hope you can make it to whatever country you want to live in .

  its extra dark coming from a german . 
  depends on what you would think is reliable . 
  he got released after a night in jail i think . 
  yes i understand , but imagine if you were a police officer . 
  and you see a screaming kid getting punched and what not by an adult . 
  are you going to say ; too bad he is a diplomat , lets just give him a warning . 
  ofcourse not . 
  and he did n't actually got arrested , he got released after a night in jail ( i believe ) . 
  if he would have been just a regular joe he would have been in a whole lot of trouble . 
  so i think the police did the right thing , let this aggresively drunken guy sleep in the cell for the night so he would n't cause any more problems . 
  that picture must have been a bitch to make . 
  the business ties go beyond tulips and dairy supplies , there is more to that to the netherlands i do n't know why russia and the netherlands are acting this way . 
  it seemed to have all started when russia introduced the anti-gay law and the netherlands , a wannabee gay-capital , started putting some diplomatic pressure on russia . 
  personally , i think the police had to arrest the diplomat who `` dragged a kid by his hairs through the house '' and i think it is weak of timmermans to apologize to putin .

  i certainly hope so , peace is always better than ( cold ) war . 
  but i do n't think many cypriots will be so accepting with these memories in their minds , maybe in a few generations . 
  then why does greece have this enourmous military pointing at turkey ? 
  when i was around the beautifull greek island i saw so much naval activity around the border . 
  i 've been to cyprus too . . and a lot of the people i talked to . 
  mostly the older people , they did n't just dislike the turks . 
  they hated them . . kind of hard not to , the turks have this giant turkish flag on a mountain that can be seen on the whole island . 
  the biggest `` fuck you '' i 've ever seen in my entire live . 
  i live in amsterdam and the police had to set up a taskforce because the pickpocketing statistics went trough the roof . 
  and they found out that 9/10 these pickpockets came from eastern europe . 
  they usually come in packed vans , and all go out to pickpocket . 
  they then return to their van and go to another city . 
  and this happens a lot !, 
  when i worked in a supermarket in the centre , there was this room with headshots of known thiefs . 
  these seemed to all come from eastern europe . 
  also , certain people who used to work around minimum wage ( mostly in the agricultural or transport sector ) now are having a though time . 
  because eastern europeans come in and work way below the minimum wage . 
  for these people now it is either stay jobless or work below minimum wage . 
  now do n't get me wrong , i really like eastern european people , nothing against them and they are very friendly and cool to hang out with . 
  but it seems like allowing these countries to join the eu is only benefical to them . . and not to the eu . 
  let alone opening their borders . 
  it is a brand , you can buy them in most supermarkets . 
  [ actually , our golden age ended because we got fucked over by england , france and m\u00fcnster .
