  after 4 hours the power was cut of and the fire department took her down . 
  this is special because there are n't that many aardvark alive worldwide . 
  a quote from the article : `` aardvark are kind of `` lomp '' ( help me out dutchies ) , we have to constantly pay attention because there is a big chance the mother will crush her newborn '' [ link ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2050334-bijzondere-geboorte-aardvarken-in-dierentuin-arnhem.html ), 
  that war were we got overrun by germans while our soldiers only had 10 bullets for a carbine and 60 for a machine gun . 
  and we managed to hold out long enough for the germans to resort to plan b ( rotterdam ) , which is overshadowed by a horrible occupation . 
  i always figured dutch culture to be somewhat close the the us culture for some reason . 
  i went from vienna to bratislava by boat :p, 
  it was a cool place . 
  should n't stay there longer than a day though , which is n't hard considering it is n't exactly the middle of nowhere . 
  vienna is right around the corner . 
  where were you planning on keeping that wallet in your french speedo 's ? 
  haha, 
  very sad , i hope the injured will recover . 
  i speak german quite well but still resort to english in germany so i understand what they are saying to each other . 
  it 's usually quite obvious when people try to fuck you over though , i do n't really need to hear what they are saying in order to recognize that . 
  there might be some minor problems that needs solving first though . 
  not really , this was it 's change to die . 
  now it has to continue being a smart . 
  yes, 
  well ... it is a heavy machine . 
  so yes ? 
  i 'm with you too , [ it 's not the first time a piece of heavy machinery crushed people in the netherlands .

  [ aftermath ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33cbpbmo8xs ), 
  there was a train heading there , and i thought . . why not ? 
  i once took a train to esch zur alzette in luxembourg years ago . 
  that was not a nice city . 
  also szcezcizczczczczin or how you write it in poland was n't really a tourist attraction to say the least . 
  did eat an awesome hamburger there at a local snackbar though , i give them that . 
  the guy running the place was awesome as well . 
  i remember a few years back i went to liege while it still had the old station , and basically right after you leave the train station there were hookers in windows . 
  was n't expecting that . 
  were n't pretty hookers either . 
  when i was a kid and my family went on vacation i remember that when we passed liege we called it the `` dirty town '' , because it smelled of heavy industry . 
  what is wrong with breda ? 
  oh wauw , that might actually be the cause of my error . 
  it 's staying .

  ** the netherlands ** is this back again or was i just not paying attention ? 
  * there was a big ass storm yesterday . 
  this is n't unusual in the netherlands but it is unusual in the summer . 
  summerstorms are notoriously dangerous because all the trees are full of leeves and indeed a lot of trees fell over . 
  one person died after a tree fell on his car , three people got injured after the same thing happened to them . 
  a couple of highways closed down because trees and branches made them unusable . 
  most of the public transport network closed down as well . 
  a transavia aircraft had to made an emergency landing at schiphol after numerous go-arounds at rotterdam [ ( captured on film ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nio38kxye-i ) . 
  also captured on film was the exciting landing of [ this boeing 777 .

  the family and friends of the girl followed the man , drove him to a stand-still on the highway and beat the shit out of him . 
  * a dangerous convict called ali benhadi escaped and is on the run . 
  he is violent when not taking his medication and possibly armed . 
  thuesday a huge police force entered a home in amsterdam - west . 
  they were searching for ali benhadi but did n't find him . 
  [ dutch article with pictures . 
  he got caught after he asked a cab-driver to guide him to an adres on schiphol airport . 
  after the cab driver noticed the driving-style of the truck driver he called the police . 
  * in uithoorn a police officer got stabbed in the arm when he wanted to arrest someone in his appartment . 
  another police officer then shot the attacker who is still in the hospital . 
  the officer is no longer in the hospital . 
  * in nieuwegein 60 guns , 36 automatic weapons , 9 hand grenades and an enormous amount of ammunition were found . 
  appearantly these were the guns used in assasinations which plagued the netherlands the last year . 
  eight people were arrested .

  those jerks brought a lot of jobs and a lot of money . 
  [ but the dark side .

   you probably ca n't get away with as much there , and given that it is a living city , british actions there are less `` forgiveable '' you 'd be surprised as how strict our police and handhaving is . 
  just because you can smoke weed and fuck hookers , does n't mean you can get away with other shit . 
  you know in how much trouble you can get for throwing a beer can in the water ? 
  i 'll have to add the dutch one myself . 
  us : i love you !, 
  russia : meh england : i love you !, 
  greece : i still love you !, 
  france : je t ` aime !, 
  i can travel for free with public transport because i 'm a student and the dutch railways surely put the money they get for it to good use !, 
  7 german coins . 
  i did just arrive home from a stay in berlin though . 
  they used it on railyards to compose trains , mostly pulling a few wagons or so . 
  that 's why you can see the train driver on the side of the locomotive , you can actually control the locomotive via the side because it is easier than getting in your cabin every time . 
  i actually have that locomotive as a small model on my desk , it is called a [ `` sik '' ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/sik_%28locomotor%29 ) ( dutch wiki ),
