  story of our lives . 
  southern germany is our last hope against feminist facism, 
  although it is bad news a lot of those flights will now be served by transavia . 
  i have to amputate my legs to travel with those aircraft . . 
  i think the whole `` cutting in the defence budget '' is a thing of the past now, 
  that would actually bring a lot more sense in that sentence !, 
  so no hitler and fritzl ? 
  i 'm out of bullets . 
  you want to know what austria is famous for ? 
  at first they are shouting ; child abuse !, 
  child abuse !, 
  ( kindermishandeling ) then one guy in the crowd starts to shout ; get that knee away !, 
  ( haal die knie weg ) , and then the rest of the crowd starts shouting that shortly after the video starts to end . 
  those sneaky bastards . . would n't expect nothing more from the ov-chipcard company . 
  you know if you hold your chipcard in a certain angle in the light it shows the text ; eerlijk & slim . 
  which means honest & smart . 
  whahahaha, 
  i do n't know , maybe she just wanted to go for a swim . 
  it has crossed my mind as well a couple of times to be honest . 
  and the only organisation for the rights of public transport passengers i know of is rover , which complains waaaay to much in my opinion . 
  ** the netherlands ** * in diemen , near my house , a huge gas-explosion occured in an appartment building . 
  there were workers working on an elevator shaft when appearantly a gas-pipe got hit or loose and a huge explosion occured . 
  two people died , 15 more got injured . 
  i have been to the spot about 30 minutes after it happened and the fact that only two people died is a miracle . 
  yesterday i went again and i noticed you could now see right through the building . 
  [ here is a video from right after it happened . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbnxdlo5sv0 ) the two people that died were n't living in the building , but were the contractors working on it . 
  i heard from my neighbour that they found one body hanging in the elevator shaft a couple of stories high and when they tried to remove him the body fell down . 
  another neighbour told me he saw one of the workers walk away from the house , realizing something and walking back when the explosion occured and he got thrown away 15 metres . 
  it was long unclear how many casualities there were since the last houses could n't be searched out of danger for collapse . 
  * the first fyra has left the netherlands so the wretched piece of fail can take up space in italy now . 
  [ here it goes . 
  ] ( http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/6615981/50fa5c93/arrivederci_faalfyra_stilletjes_het_land_uit_gesleept.html ) on the line this train was supposed to run on ( amsterdam-rotterdam-breda ) they have used older intercities that go 160 km/h max for a while now and the ns has decided to keep using them . 
  but they changed the name from fyra to intercity direct . 
  and they are also going to chance the ugly colours . 
  [ here is the first train in new coloours in this facebook link . 
  ] ( https://www.facebook.com/nedtrain/posts/775452969165290 ) * the police was attacked by a group of around 200 persons in the notorious schilderswijk in the hague . 
  the police responded to a guy beating up his child in front of a supermarket . 
  when the police intervened so did the amassed crowd and the police arrested a 13-year old for intervening with police bussiness . 
  when they did this the crowd went mental and a guy attacked the police officers with a meat chopper and then the police drew their firearms . 
  [ there is a video about this incident on youtube . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhoebiueay8 ) * a lady missed her ferry at the amsterdam central station . 
  so she decided to swim across the ij . 
  the lady was ok , but emergency services pulled out just in case and checked her for hypothermia . 
  she was given no fine . 
  [ here is an article with video her swimming . 
  at the almere train station a women was knocked unconcious after a gate closed into her face . 
  at the amsterdam amstel station someone broke their glasses in the same way . 
  de maatschappij voor een beter ov ( society for a better public transport , it 's the first time i heard of it ) said that they get calls every month about these things happening . 
  i myself experienced the same thing once and it hurt . . these gates close fast . 
  [ the gates look like this . 
  ] ( http://www.transportticket.com/image/chipkaart/ovchipkaart-poortjes-ret.jpg ) * the police arrested someone going 25 km/h on the a2-highway in a stolen microcar . 
  they now suspect him of murdering the former owner of the microcar . 
  * there was no train-traffic for most of friday to schiphol airport because someone stole the copper-wiring . 
  if anyone has more , please collaborate , 
  the netherlands is by far not the best country for non-western immigrants . 
  tolerance has been thrown out of the window a long time ago . 
  nobody gives two fucks about china 's foreign policy . 
  they could napalm the whole of tibet and people will just cluck their tongues and shudder . 
  if american soldiers kill one civilian the whole world goes absolutely batshit insane . 
  it sucks but for some reason that is how this world works . . 
  oh , right .
