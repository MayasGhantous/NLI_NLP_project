  we have the ugliest number plates in the whole wide world . 
  when i 'm abroad for a while , and return back to the netherlands . 
  i 'm stunned every time by how ugly those yellow plates look on nice cars . 
  belarussian sea-food ? 
  nope nope nope,

  yes , the british are weird . 
  but in a good way . 
  well , the photographer tried to include them . 
  but his camera got stolen . 
  we all came on belgium . 
  germany , france and england even at the same time . 
  i present to you : [ limburg ] ( http://www.provum.nl/files/2013/06/limburg.jpg ) we can into hills . 
  it prevents delays , and that is making them faster in a way . . 
  still , people keep dying in belgium . 
   and the ecologist inside you smiles i think that guy is mostly smiling because of what his left hand is doing . 
  fuck they discovered my secret , time to ring up my old pal kim ... 
  well , if coffeeshops are the reason to move to amsterdam you need to get your priorities straight anyway :p the reason i love amsterdam is because i 've grown up here and lived here all my life . 
  it has a special feeling to it that you ca n't describe to anyone . 
  sure it is ridden with drunken english , stoned french , puke , dogshit , kamikaze cyclists and psychotic automobilists but i love this city damnit !, 
  yes , we have bad neighbourhoods as well . 
  the schilderswijk is far from tolerant and liberal . . 
  well to be honest , amsterdam best netherlands !, 
  delivered without the containing package . 
  maybe with the privatization of the dutch railway system in the future these connection will start to appear . 
  lol a tram wtf xd they took the `` force them in the slowest train '' tactic and stepped it up a notch . 
  they need to stop with the borders already and make them into normal train routes . 
  when going abroad you either have to pay a supplement for a high-speed train or take the slowest train the companies have in their arsenal ( heerlen-aachen for example ) why ca n't there be a regular intercity that goes amsterdam-maastricht-cologne . . 
  will you get your way , [ friedman will be right again . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_next_100_years#new_powers_arise ), 
  i think the brussels-cologne high-speed would go over liege instead of maastricht . 
  why ? 
  because it already does so . 
  no porn in norway, 
  i already imagine putin raging der untergang-style ; these dicks ca n't keep one fucking thing a secret !, 
  goddamnit france stop giving the russians nice things !, 
  to go to war with japan . 
  the cat is old and incontinent . 
  the entire couch is soaked with piss . 
  you are right , my cat did n't do those things . 
  not sure there was a `` siege '' they just kind of went there and did n't left . 
  like how my cat `` sieged '' the right side of my couch . 
  no , putin will most likely go like ; the evil ukrainians destroyed a humanitarian aid convoy hurddurdur . 
  so it begins . . 
  yes , martin van drunen is a real killer . 
  really cool guy as well , one of those that you see standing in the crowd during the opening/closing acts instead of lurking backstage . 
  their songs do n't have a nations demographics as the main subject . 
  [ nobody into death metal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujualhzclyy ) no ? 
  [ we are at 16.8 million right now so it 's kind of outdated . 
  just out of curiousity , you have never been in drenthe ? 
  what you 've been up to in that part of germany ? 
  wacken ? 
  you rented a boat on the ijsselmeer ? 
  do n't worry , we have all been there once . 
  [ this is mine ] ( http://imgur.com/xwrkstr ) i 've counted all the places i have at least walked around for a while , driving through them does n't count :p some things were a bit hard , because i 've been to countries like belgium and germany so many times i do n't know witch provinces i 've visited . 
  other than that the islands ( malta/aland ) were kind of tricky to fill up without colouring the entire sea . 
  when i was younger i 've travelled by train all over switserland so that one looks nice and green , 
  you dare to insult our glorious stampot ? 
  on sep the 1st i can once again pick up my new student public transport card . 
  this means i can travel for free on the weekdays with everything from local busses to long-distance trains . 
  other than that , travelling by train is expensive . 
  a few days back i had to pay around 40 euro for an amsterdam-groningen return ticket . 
  feels so bad because the day before i paid just a bit more than the double price for an ice-high speed vienna-frankfurt-amsterdam ticket . . other than the idiotic prices , the railway system is one of the best of the world . 
  dutch people like to complain about it * a lot * , but in reality delays are relatively uncommon and the density of the railroad system is absurdly high . 
  for long-distances the trains are comfortable ; for the busy routes the [ regiorunners ] ( http://www.rail-pictures.com/1024/irm-regiorunner-double-unit-is-7471.jpg ) are used . 
  for other routes the [ koploper ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/ns_koploper_icm_4227_verlaat_utrecht_centraal.jpg ) . 
  on regional lines the [ slt ] ( http://www.fransmensonides.nl/foto/slt_gd.jpg ) is mostly used which i hate because it does n't have a toilet and the seats are built for lilliputters . 
  in the more rural areas the regional lines are run by veolia , arriva and a number of other companies . 
  for the other public-transport . 
  i only really know it in amsterdam . 
  there are a lots of trams , which is not a really good system . 
  there is a subway line with about 5 stops underground . 
  the swampy ground of amsterdam makes building a good subway very hard . 
  they are trying to build a new subway-line but it turned out a lot harder than expected . 
  it should have been opened in 2011 but now this is delayed to 2017 . 
  not even to speak about the costs . . for me , i drive a scooter through town . 
  it is way faster and cheaper than going by public transport or by car . 
  and when i had something to drink i use my bicycle . 
  that bandana guy in the first pic of the article looks cool as fuck though , reminds me of battlefield ; bad company . 
  those volvo 's are mostly used by the traffic police , like in wegmisbruikers , 
  were you live maybe , but here they either drive in these [ tourans ] ( http://police-car-photos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/3821.jpg ) or these [ volkswagen vans ] ( http://police-car-photos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/518.jpg ) the only police that does n't drive in a volkswagen is the highway police . 
  they use these [ volvo 's ] ( http://i1181.photobucket.com/albums/x439/jasir_kuiper/img_1261.jpg ), 
  should n't have split from the czech republic then :p, 
  the town centre , it 's cozy and the view from the castle is outstanding . 
  though i have to be honest , it really is a `` 1 day city '' since it is not `` that '' big . 
  last week i visited bratislava , more beautiful than i expected !, 
  [ dutch bicycle cops best bicycle cops .

  it would be way more effective to piss it out than to jizz it out . 
  then why is n't there a french flag in that picture ? 
  hammerfest sound like a metalfestival . 
  i like belgians , they have humour . 
  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/category:trash_bins_in_the_netherlands#mediaviewer/file:litter_bin_graffiti.jpg  you live here ? 
  ooooeeeeehhh  in this you will find lots of sex .

   thrashbin is cool because shoarma is good for you . 
   it is a cunt , it is a dick , together it is cuntdick !, 
  i thought i translate it for you guys .
