  do you really want me to explain that to you ? 
  you should spread the ~ ~ word ~ ~ protein !, 
  this whole thread made me crack up . 
  no , the italians said there are no major problems with the train so it must be fine . 
  loosing parts mid-journey can happen to any train / s, 
  i agree , the fyra is a public health violation . 
  and trains complain a lot less . 
  italian ? 
  free wifi on intercity trains in the netherlands * puts sunglasses on * awwwww yeah !, 
  oh , i thought you ment they were about to be demolished . 
  i think it looks like one of those small vacu\u00fcm-cleaners . 
  yes i know what the mat '54 are . 
  i noticed the virm-trend as well . . lots of them on the hanzelijn . 
  but i do n't think the icm are getting phased out or i would have heard of it . 
  they are still running the intercity amersfoort - amsterdam - enkhuizen that i do know for sure :p, 
  cheapest bid . 
  thats it . 
  i believe that is because the ns did n't ordered extra slts because of the toilet-issue and had to phase out the mat '64 series . 
  and even then most of these services are getting serviced by the new nid . 
  i believe the icm still runs the rotterdam/the hague-groningen/leeuwarden lines in the schedule . 
  nope , nope all wrong . 
  they arent getting phased out until over 10 years or so . 
  they have just been modernized . 
  the train in the picture is the modernized icm , [ this is how they looked before ] ( http://www.kevinevers.nl/pa150001.jpg ) . 
  only the first series 4001-4011 went to the butcher . 
  in the past these trains could be coupled so that you can walk between train-sets . 
  [ like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mii2cdyg7jc ) . 
  therefore they have the nickname `` koploper '' ( head-walker ) . 
  but since the modernisation this option is removed because it caused delays . 
  the virm is another intercity ment for busy randstad services although in practice they run along the long-distance icm-trains . 
  the icm is my favourite train to ride in , they are so comfy !, 
  yup , they are stored near my house . 
  and they take up a lot of space . . [ and they are ugly as fuck .

  here another question , how conservative are the austrians ? 
  i have long hair to my arm-pits as a male and i get stares of dissaproval in masse in this city . 
  i really like vienna , that 's not the point . 
  but this staring . . 
  in my case that would sound a lot worse . 
  does it really sound good in german ears ? 
  i can speak quite a lot of german but right now in austria i resort to speaking english to spare me the emberassment :p, 
  i thought the largest building in the czech republic was the tv-tower in prague ? 
  or does n't that qualify as a building ? 
  i saw it on the page , turned my head and looked at the tower in real-life :p, 
  interesting !, 
  have you ever experienced a blown-tire on the metro ? 
  how was it like ? 
  i remember those paris metro 's used rubber tires , why ? 
  speaking as someone who went to school with that metro , [ my buttocks did n't found it as charming as you do . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/interieur_lhb_metro_amsterdam.jpg ), 
  that is the sexy new amsterdam metro that is going into service as of this year . 
  [ they are replacing these pieces of crap we have had since the 70 's ] ( http://www.nicospilt.com/dia/dia5905.jpg ) also , there is an interesting metro driving around this city on line 51 . 
  it is a metro that converts into a tram , by switching from 3rd rail to overhead wire , and [ looks like this ] ( http://amstelveen.blog.nl/files/2011/02/tramlijn_511.jpg ) the spanish helped us out with a shortage of metro 's and sold us [ these things ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8040/8060851334_c506f33925_z.jpg ) which are serving both on the regular metro-lines as on the 51-line . 
  the netherlands : number 2 in anything . 
  putin can suck my netherlands . 
  yes i know , it 's just . 
  i 'm on vacation you know i do n't have reason to do math !, 
  it 's the 8th month , so more than half are born in 1999 edit : oh shit school was a long time ago as well . . 
  nice . 
  also , most 16-year olds are now born in ... 1998 they were 3 years old when 9/11 happened . 
  they never knew the world * before the internet . 
  * they have never used windows 3.1 or even 95 . . their starting system was windows xp . 
  i 'm feeling old . . 
  and ... ehm ... certain parts of eastern europe arent the prettiest either . 
  and we fought the japanese with our navy , but everybody keeps forgetting about that . . 
  you are hereby banned from our beaches . 
  well , we also have an excellent train-system . 
  yes , for him it was pretty easy getting out of that grave . 
  the amsterdam bus shown was only a single prototype that does n't drive through the city anymore . 
  that factory is in limburg , i believe it 's making mitsubishi 's now . 
  it used to produce smart cars . 
  dutch car best car !, 
  the dutch roads are among the best in europe , and i say this like that because i am dutch and therefore would be arrogant to call them the best in europe . 
  the belgians roads have lots of holes , and are very noisy in general . 
  hertog jan one of the best beers in the country , i think everybody visiting the netherlands should try one . 
  or more . 
  gambrinus , cheap and delicious . 
  i wonder why nobody has picked up on the fact that a white vs brown dish is called `` war fries '', 
  i clicked on this gif while playing hail of bullets - guadalcanal in the background . 
  his head shaked with the music at 0:33 perfectly . 
  laughed out loud :p, 
  i do the historical context of the song . 
  but they do n't taste good trust me . 
  but i 'm not of german blood . 
  and i will never in my life honour the spanish king . 
  i think our anthem needs some updating , but i 'm afraid the end-result will be horrible . 
  remember the koningslied ? 
  same here , i tried eating those blocks you put in your dishwasher because we were out of candy :p, 
  even the french do n't like that city so i do n't think it 's that strange of you . 
  when i worked in the albert heijn i got asked this a lot . 
  appearantly a lot of foreigners think we sell weed at the supermarket :p, 
  this sounds like the start of a bond-movie . 
   so it 's nature reserve type land on top the kennemerduinen , that is a very cool place . 
  beautifull . 
  [ netherlands can into nature . 
  a bit yes , but i 'm sure it was n't easy being germanies short-cut either . 
  it 's not that our mayonaise is sweet , it 's just that you have grown up to tolerate mayonaise which tastes like it has been spilled on the ground 5 years ago and recycled . 
  yup , you and poland are two countries which history has n't treated well . 
  aahaha we war you !, 
  scheldt blockade best decision ever !,
