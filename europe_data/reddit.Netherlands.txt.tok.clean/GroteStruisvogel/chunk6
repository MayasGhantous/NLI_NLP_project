  it 's waaaaay to souer . 
  everybody has their own musical taste and that is fine . 
  but the lyric thing i do n't really understand . 
  there are tons of movies with that as their main subject but somehow when a band starts writing lyrics about it it is wrong . 
  i am just now listening to a song about the japanese army in ww2 . 
  those lyrics are n't weird they are cool as shit and the music fits the subject as a perfect soundtrack . 
  [ hear that riff come in at 1:50 \\ m / ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5v0kwodapu ), 
  what is offensive about metal festivals ? 
  they tried the same thing here when the elsrock metalfestival was held in perhaps the most religious village of the country . 
  in the end it just ment that a lot of signs were put up telling us how evil we are . 
  it 's nice to see some confirmation . 
  we got the jews , you guys got the blacks . 
  we all got history son . 
  berlin as the capital of europe ?? 
  you know it ai n't * that * long ago :p, 
  we could call it : our western neighbour is an idiot . 
  than you guys automatically get taunted if you do n't stay in . 
  i subbed , that 's weird to read . 
  yes !, 
  those straight roads in the us and the guns in every locker room would make for a great stalingrad situation . 
   amsterdam is one of the world 's great cities . 
  you should seriously come to / r/thenetherlands spread the word a little . . you know a lot of dutch people are not as intelligent as you are !, 
  seriously , what is up with those roads ? 
  you can fucking hear you crossed the border it 's pathetic . 
  no disrespect but the flemish mayonaise is absolutely horrible . 
  ireland is my favourite country in europe besides the netherlands so you know . 
   no mountains here either . 
  i feel you bros :( respect brother . 
  struggle together . 
  well , you know ... the beach is never below sea level . . 
  nope , just germans . 
  they had more impact on the coastline with their bunkers and holes than the sea itself . 
  does n't matter , holland is the best part of the netherlands anyway . 
  [ kapsalon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kapsalon ) i am a simple man . 
  i work for the mail-service . 
  i wish people thanked me for my service :p, 
  [ for you romania ] ( http://www.clipartbest.com/cliparts/mil/lad/millad6et.png ), 
  i figured if you do this often , and than attack for real . 
  you give the boarder-guards less time to prepare . 
  if you oppose ~ ~ russia ~ ~ almighty putin the flawless , well sorry to tell you but you 're a fascist . 
  that is when they awake the dutch lion . 
   crude petroleum , processed by dutch refineries in rotterdam , accounts for the lion 's share . 
  and 30 percent of crude oil and 45 percent of oil products entering rotterdam come from russia . 
  four thousand dutch companies do business in russia , making the netherlands one of the top investors in russia , with more than $ 63 billion put down . 
  i did not know that , fuck . 
  in the article it says that they will most likely be there to protect the researchers .

  `` free port '' we are dutch , nothing is free haha, 
  maybe they could put a secret remotely controlled self-destruct system on the ship, 
  quality over quantity . 
  the opposite is true in the netherlands which specializes in `` slightly flavoured water '' otherwise known as heineken . 
  i really like the look of those new skoda 's , [ this is a though car !, 
  have you tried driving on the ceintuurbaan or the overtoom when it 's busy ? 
  you wo n't get anywere with a car . 
  that , and the fact half the city is always under construction/maintenance ... right now the piet heijn-tunnel is closed so the whole indische buurt is jammed up . 
  they should put a sign up at the arrival-hall of schiphol that says : caution , a cab drive to the city centre will cost you more than 50 euros . 
  she is getting yelled at by the taxi-driver obviously . 
  so there you are , hiding under the table while everybody is looking at you . 
  cyprus really made an impression on me . 
  the island is beautifull , absolutely stunning . 
  but there was one city , i can not recall the name of , were there was a dmz-zone were nobody went since the cease-fire . 
  if you looked through the fence you could see parts of the city that looks like tjernobyl , with trees growing through houses etc. 
  there was also a very large tower with a big hole in it that looked like it was hit with a missile . 
  on the other hand , have you seen the number of yellow plates on french highways in the summer ? 
  who would have thought ? 
  here i was thinking it were the evil ukrainian nazi jews who shot that plane down . . 
  that does n't immediatly mean that dutch is an easier language to learn if you are an english speaker . 
  dutch pronounciation is extremely hard . 
  or maybe they could stop interrupting pers-conferences with stupid questions about things that had already been made clear in the pers-conference itself . 
  french is easier , just saying . 
  even if you learn dutch , you come to the netherlands and start speaking dutch here . . everybody you speak to switches to english as soon as they hear your accent . 
  we are assholes like that . 
  i just watched the pers-conference were they said that number has again been increased to 189, 
  and a big fire-radius . 
  aaaand burn . 
  facebook brought me the story of a guy who is now in a hospital after he lost his whole family . 
   she is now my ex after i fucked her to death . 
  he was born french so . . 
  you do realize we all move to vlaanderen after that do you ? 
   no fucking way that the dutch people are going to accept anything short of serious action now . 
  you do n't know dutch politics . 
  you could nuke the randstad and they still wo n't do something . 
  you know i would n't be surprised if it happened like that . 
  on the other hand , russia 's plays politics like a game of chess . 
  you never know what the motives behind their moves are . 
  i deleted it because it was an idiotic comment , and now the awkwardness that you already replied to it  . <, 
  so what do you propose we do ? 
  dude , these missiles might be fired by rebels . . weapons like these in the hands of rebels do n't make an accident unlickely . . 
  why do n't we just rule out if it was an accident first before drawing conclusions ? 
  i mean , [ the military of your own country once made the same mistake . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655 ), 
  oh , sorry sealand . 
  but your runway ai n't big enough . 
  yes , i worked at schiphol and this was always a pretty full flight . 
  lots of people took this flight to continue their journey to australia or new zealand . 
  it was shot down with a buk missile system . 
  [ those machines look like this . 
  ] ( http://rt.com/files/politics/kuril-islands-defense-military-736/buk-m1-anti-aircraft-missile-system.jpg ) but seeing how the `` self defence-forces '' had armed themselves very well in crimea . . the only conclusion we can draw is that ukraine has excellent flea-markets . . 
  i read from various sources that the plane was shot down using a `` buk '' surface to air missile .
