  295 people who did n't had a single fucking thing to do with the situation in ukraine dead . 
  another horrible chapter in this sad story . 
  ** the netherlands ** * we are out the world cup against argentina . 
  [ we played outstanding though , the whole cup we played beautifull games ] ( http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/6608931/79f61be6/hoogtepunten_nederland_wk_2014.html ) and for the next game : go germans !, 
  * friday-night a freakstorm unleashed it 's fury over the country . 
  were i lived i could enjoy the stroboscopic thunderstorm , unfortunatly a guy trying to hide from the rain in the centre of amsterdam died after a tree [ fell on the busstop he was hiding in for the rain . 
  ] ( http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/131014/storm-eist-een-leven ) in the rest of the country some streets and basements flooded , and a library got destroyed . 
  * the police arrested a drunk driver driving against traffic on the a7 highway . 
  * a guy got killed in amsterdam in a drive-by in which a german plated grey golf was used . 
  * in norteast groningen a couple of bridges are getting maintenance so that a couple of villages are difficult to reach for dutch ambulances . 
  temporarily these villages will get served by german ambulances . 
  * from now on the paper train ticket will dissapear , you can now only use the nationwide hated chipcard to travel by train . 
  * a transavia-pilot removed all the passengers of his flight and flew home with an empty aircraft from turkey . 
  the pilot requested if a couple of passengers could be moved because of the weight-balance and the passengers started to get `` aggressive against the flight-crew '', 
  i really hope we see each other in the final , it would be a beautifull game . 
  me too , van gaal is a football-god . 
  he is a true genius , and if you speak dutch it 's even better . 
  the way he answers press questions is hilarious . 
  first got ta get rid of a little argentina problem . 
  and if you drive a scooter in belgium , you do n't even have to have a plate !, 
  or the traffic jam in brussels/antwerp that has been going on for 30 years straight now . 
  what an excuse !, 
  it is because some people are a bit afraid of flying and get drunk before boarding the flight and these people can be very annoying . 
  i worked on an airport , and this happens a lot often causing delays and you name it . 
  almost right , nowadays tatars ride on pink unicorns as the gay horsemen tearing down the fabric of russian society and with moral chaos as their only goal . 
  if it was foggy we would have had a tenerife 2 on our hands . 
  that would be quite a sight considering the railroad looks like [ this ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02965/tynllwynnen_1_2965910c.jpg ), 
  it is n't hard to spot a bomb on an x-ray since every material has it 's own colour on that screen . 
  a bomb would probably be very dense and organic so it stands out like a gay ballerina in baghdad . 
  i came here very skeptical , but this was indeed very dangerous . 
  did the a340 had permission to cross the runway ? 
  ** the netherlands ** * we won our football match against costa rica . 
  barely , thanks to a surprise move from louis van genius . 
  now up to argentina , to be honest my buttcheeks are clenched so tight i could sharpen a pencil with it . 
  but like always with the dutch team ; if you expect them to play an easy game they are getting owned , if you expect them to play a hard game they are owning . 
  * the police got a call in utrecht about a shooting were someone supposedly got hit , but when the police arrived both the shooter and the victim were gone . 
  * last year 19 people drowned in recreational waters , a staggering 7 of them were polish . 
  because of this our rescue brigade gets help from their polish colleagues who will provide information and help in polish . 
  * the headquarters of dutchbat in potocari , screbrenica will become a museum . 
  dutchbat veterans will help with the renovation and the project will cost a total of 1 million euro 's . 
  pax ( a peace organisation ) says that the goal of the museum is not to look for the truth but to present conflicting stories and visions together . 
  * a whole lot of shitstorm about our sinterklaas tradition , a judge ruled that our `` rascist '' zwarte piet needs to be `` re-evaluated '' or something . 
  a dutch human rights board said that dutch people were unwilling to accept zwarte piet as racist because :  dutch natives have a positive view of themselves and the netherlands , see themselves as a victim quicker than immigrants , and claim to have more right on anything dutch . 
  they do n't even realize that saying that is racist themselves ... * an accident happened were a truck smashed through a highway-barrier , onto the railroad amsterdam zuid - schiphol . 
  causing huge disruptions in both train and car-traffic . 
  [ here is a dutch video . 
  ] ( http://nos.nl/video/670345-verkeershinder-bij-schiphol.html ) * the emergency services of rotterdam are now experimenting with a new vehicle . 
  this vehicle is both and ambulance as a firetruck . 
  [ it looks like this . 
  ] ( http://content.nos.nl/data/image/xxl/2014/06/30/668533.jpg ), 
  i thought the polonaise means making a train with everybody by grabbing each others shoulders and then parading around the room . 
  but my countrymen are just weird at parties . 
   build new nuclear power plants and nationalize the entire power industry . 
  you know we are trying to stay nuclear-free . . and you guys are n't exactly helping with all these power plants of impending doom and horror at our border . 
   re-nationalise public transport  re-nationalise postal services  stop the tax evasion by foreign companies through fake registration in the netherlands  eliminate all excise tax on alcohol/cigarettes/gasoline aaaaand bankrupt . 
  i could name my star after you for 30 . 
   the dutch soldiers failed them it 's the job of a soldier to do as they are told , and they were just following orders they did n't fail anybody . 
  also be carefull what you say , imagine being one of those soldiers . 
  i know some came back very fucked up from the whole ordeal . 
  i remember going on vacation to france as a kid by car with my parents , and the stench of the heavy industry in that city was horrible just driving through it . 
  this was a long time ago so it 's probably better nowadays . 
  i 've been there for a couple of times afterwards , not going very far from the train station to be honest . 
  the 're are a lot of nicer places in belgium so to speak , although luik may be better in other parts . 
  charleroi , and liege too for that matter , are shitholes regardless of the people who live there . 
  that 's because you killed them before you got to know them . 
  i can feel that burn all the way over here . 
  it 's a start but 1 czech koruna is still only 4 eurocent :p, 
  it would make things a lot simpler though , i still have a fuckload of czech currency laying around here because there are just so much coins . 
  why ? 
  they are built in france !, 
  if those ships have the same quality as their cars , russia owning them would be an advantage for nato !, 
  are you deaf ? 
  the roads i often drive , over the afsluitdijk and almere-lelystad . . i think 130 is perfectly fine . 
  these are straight roads were you drive 140-ish anyway . 
  keeping it 120 is too slow in my opinion . 
  the maximum speed in the netherlands is 130 since a short while ago . 
  also , do not drink those entire jugs of beer you see in the picture before driving . 
  it 's bad . 
   driving relaxed  in the netherlands maybe outside of the randstad , but inside ? 
  it 's not like fire-arms are totally illegal in europe . 
  you just have to be a member of a shooting-centre for a while and you must pass a psychological test . . at least were i live . 
  and i think this is a better system than just buying firearms at wallmart or whatever . 
  keeps the guns from the crazies . 
  2014 were the americans wish for soviet era-housing in their country . . 
  also merkel 's hairy twat . 
  out of respect to the fallen finnish . 
  they can have their bit , flanders is the best bit anyway . 
  sooo ... we can annex belgium now ? 
  yes ? 
  let 's just say i hope we can win over you guys next time :p, 
  maybe they could place a guy at each exit of the roundabout , and if someone drove nicely and behaved himself he gives the driver 10 pounds . 
  you 'll be cheaper off and you keep the motorists happy . 
  i do n't know about belgium , but here they have implemented an alcohol-lock . 
  if you get caught a number of times they install a lock in your car that can only be opened if you blow in a device and the device measures the alcohol in your breath . 
  so if you have alcohol in your breath your car wo n't start . 
  and you have to pay for the entire program including the device yourself . 
  the total cost of this is around 4000 euros . 
  ** the netherlands ** ** we will become world champion !, 
  ** * a 52-year old homeless man stole an ypr ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aifv ) ) at a military base and made a joy-ride with it on the highway . 
  he got arrested when he stopped at a gas-station .
