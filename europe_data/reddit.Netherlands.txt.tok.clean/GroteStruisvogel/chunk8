  [ here is a pic of a crane lifting the ypr he stole . 
  ] ( http://content.nos.nl/data/image/xxl/2014/06/28/667882.jpg ) * a museum in amsterdam is showing art from crimea . 
  expensive , gold , art . 
  but now that the russians have annexed crimea it is unclear to whom this art needs to be returned since both the russians as the ukrainians are claiming it . 
  right now lawyers are investigating the case but this might take some time because ; every document needs to be translated first . 
  * [ eleven people got injured after a bus rear-ended a traffic jam . 
  ] ( http://content.nos.nl/data/image/xxl/2014/06/27/667332.jpg ) * a 20-year old male got a prison sentence of a year after he killed 3 of his friends because he drove of a bridge going 200 km/h . 
  a detail is that he was the designated driver . . * something happened in a juwelery store , probably a robbery , in which the owner and another person ( the robber ? ), 
  got stabbed . 
  the ` other ' person died from this . 
  as of now nobody really knows what went on in there , but if this is a robbery this is the second case in which robbers got killed in a short time and the last time the media-uproar was enormous . 
  * a big piece of the city centre of amsterdam , dam square and the bijenkorf got closed for public because of a bomb-threat . 
  no bomb has been found . 
  * a rotterdam taxi-driver got stabbed in the abdomen because the costumer did n't thought he was driving fast enough . 
  * two bodies of the missing girls kris kremers and lisanne froon have been found in panama . 
  what has happened to them is unclear as of now . 
  and then ... hahaha ... and then i just put all those green men on their country . 
  and ... bwahahaha ... they were like . 
  who the fuck are they ? 
  better get the fuck out of here !, 
  and now that land is mine hahahaha !, 
  it could , depends on the air-pressure . 
  never were i live . 
  nope , ca n't beat that . 
  you won . 
  the metro-station of rotterdam central station looks awesome though . 
  just like the station itself . 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  [ here is how the amsterdam metro looks . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/amsterdam_metro_lhb.jpg ) thankfully they are getting replaced now . 
  thnx , fixed it . 
  she was quite big though . 
  belgians say `` poepen '' , i learned this because there was a scandal over there were some mayor got filmed while she got banged from behind while enjoying the sight on a castle . 
  the headlines in belgium said `` de poepende burgemeester '' ( the fucking mayor ) what so weird about this is that in the netherlands , poepen means taking a shit . 
  that headline here means `` the shitting mayor '', 
   unfortunately , she has a condition where all her kids are retards ... :( she 's belgian ? 
  in dutch dom means stupid . 
  i 'd say we tried to stay nuclear-free and you fucked it up for us big time . 
  the only thing i can tell you is that you must not put your phone in a cargoshort pocket at temple bar . 
  beware , i was there last year and my phone got stolen :(, 
  i just woke up in my underwear beneath a bench on the museumplein with cocks drawn all over me and for some reason it 's now monday . . 
  thats nice , here these girls got their hair shaved off , swastika 's drawn upon and then paraded through town . 
  we were relatively mild in our colonial years , compared to other countries at least . 
  but then again , mild in those times did n't mean respecting human rights . 
  like the punisment for rebellious slaves :  [ to force an iron meat hook beneath a person 's ribs , and hang him up to die slowly .

  the only thing you are missing here is that the russians in power do n't give jack shit about diplomacy as long as their wallets do n't get hurt . 
  i 've been to pisa , it is a nice city but i do have to advice you to visit florence as well because it is not far away and also very awesome . 
  next week i 'm going to hellfest , a metalfestival in france near nantes . 
  and then in a couple of months i 'm going to take the night-train to prague to visit a friend , and from there i 'll take a train to vienna to visit my parents . 
  [ here is another metro-line under construction in amsterdam . 
  ] ( http://www.hierzijnwij.nu/category/stations ), 
  did n't lissabon just completed a beautifull metro-line ? 
  in the south , but when i drove up north . . a lot of people at the gas-stations and supermarkets did n't speak english . 
  [ or they could just replace them with these ones .

  ** the netherlands ** * a norwegian 17-year old boy suffering from autism hid in the wheel-well of a klm-cityhopper aircraft and died from oxygen-starvation in-flight . 
  he was found by the ground crew on schiphol airport . 
  * a shell plant has gone up in flames . 
  the fire was enormous and the explosions were heard up to 30 kilometres away . 
  luckily only a few people suffered from light injuries . 
  [ here is a news-link in english . 
  ] ( http://rt.com/news/163436-shell-explosion-moerdijk-netherlands/ ) * good news , from next year on municipalities can decide on their own policy regarding mopeds . 
  in the netherlands there are two kinds of mopeds , one with a yellow license plate which are allowed up to 45 km/h , usually drive on the road and a helmet is mandatory . 
  and the blue plates allowed on the cycle path , no helmet required , and up to 25 km/h . 
  problem is dat 99 % of the blue plated ones have their restrictions removed and in some cities they are a plague . 
  now that the law has changed a city like amsterdam can say that these blue plates are n't allowed on the cycle-path but on the road where they are also required to wear helmets . 
  * a jogger died of a heart-attack after the ambulance-personell could n't get to him fast enough because they did n't had the key to remove a pole intended to keep cars of a cycling path . 
  * an artist had a genius idea , to put a huge women without a head and arms next to a railway . 
  railway personell soon started to complain because they did n't want to relive some nasty experiences railways personell sometimes have to deal with . 
  the piece of `` art '' has now been moved elsewere . 
  * [ the police are getting a new , more modern , uniform . 
  i think it looks like they come from star trek .

  he can come on a landing craft !, 
  we will be waiting in the dunes , 
   sounds like you 're surrounded by really drunk english-speakers . 
  like being back in the uk ? 
  ehm ... why do so many people die in belgium ? 
  only the weedpass idea was let go off almost a year ago . 
  it 's the stupid corrupt opstelten/teeven duo you have to thank for this bullshit . . they are the satan in our politics . . 
  to be honest , it was only a year ago i found out about the german part of belgium . 
  i took a random train to it 's final station were i ended up in a nice town were everybody suddenly spoke german . 
  i was n't even sure if i was in belgium anymore :p, 
   government of the german-speaking community lol what , that is only one town or something . 
  i love belgian humour . 
  the best stuff comes from belgium . 
  sometimes the laughing hurts . 
  [ stuff like this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voanalpqcqu ), 
  yes , soused herring . 
  love it !, 
  now that you say it , the best herring are caught end may/beginning of july because then the fish are full of oil and some non-tasty organs are undeveloped . 
  this means it wo n't be long until i can enjoy this sweeet dish again , 
  it 's funny that d\u00f6ner kebab is actually a german brand . 
  western europe totally stole a turkish dish and made it it 's bitch :p, 
  here in amsterdam there are snacks that you can pull out of a wall [ like this . 
  ] ( http://ockideashare.blog.com/files/2011/03/dsc045271.jpg ) these things are very easy , just put a 1/2 euro coin in the machine and choose the ( probably deep-fried ) snack you like . 
  you do n't have to stand in line so it 's perfect at train-stations etc. 
  my favourite snack is by far the [ ragout-filled kroket ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croquette ) .
