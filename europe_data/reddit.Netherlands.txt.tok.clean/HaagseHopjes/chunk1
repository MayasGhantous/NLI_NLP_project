the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung is a mainstream , centrist daily newspaper . 
   but muslims declare that isis are n't muslim . 
  that depends on which muslim you ask . 
  some of them declare that isis are not muslims . 
  however , some of them consider isis to be muslims . 
  there are even groups of muslims that recognize that isis follows the quran quite closely , but that condemn isis because they are n't scriptural literalists themselves . 
   and now you 're saying that they are muslims they follow the quran and the hadiths quite closely , yes . 
  that makes them muslims in the eyes of many people that are familiar with islamic doctrines . 
   and that they draw heavily from the muslims community . 
  they recruit radicalized youths among the muslim community , yes . 
  who else would they recruit ? 
  buddhists ? 
  they claim to be a muslim group , why would they recruit non-muslims ? 
  note that that does not mean that the majority ( let alone * all * ) of people in the muslim community feel like joining isis . 
  not even close . 
  the majority of muslims most probably wants nothing to do with isis . 
  but the considerable minority that does support isis : they are the big problem that european countries have to deal with . 
   as such , having a muslim community seems dangerous , according to your analysis . 
  sure some may be more dangerous than others , but clearly the fact that the muslim community exists , is a danger . 
  if a fixed percentage of a group are radicals , that means that the larger the group , the larger the amount of radicals . 
  if a given percentage of muslims are radicals , and the entire group becomes twice as big , that group of radicals will also become twice as big . 
  if the percentage of radicals among muslims is markedly higher than the percentage of other extremist elements among the general population , that would mean that an increase of muslims in a given country could be a danger to that country 's security . 
  i believe this to be the case , because i believe that young muslims are quite prone to radicalization . 
  i also believe that islam is an anti-humanist , anti-enlightenment ideology , that threatens our western values through its expansionist dogmas . 
  the basques actually differ a lot from the romance cultures elsewhere on the iberian peninsula . 
  for starters , basque is a language isolate ; not related to any other european language . 
  i am okay with other cultures , as long as they are compatible with mine . 
  as it happens , the differences between polish and dutch culture are not big enough to be insurmountable . 
  the polonization of the silesians should be seen in the context of the aftermath of wwii , by the way . 
  yes , and that 's why i explained that as a percentage * of the muslim community * of those countries , albania actually has very few people that joined isis . 
  you 're misunderstanding my point . 
  according to estimates , there are about 5 million muslims in france . 
  1700 french muslims joined isis . 
  that 's 1 per 3,000 muslim inhabitants . 
  there are about 2.5 million muslims in albania . 
  a little over 100 albanian muslims joined isis . 
  that 's 1 per 25,000 muslim inhabitants . 
  you can be willfully obtuse , but that 's not necessary . 
  scholars also call poland homogenuous . 
  yes , all of us were at some point in distant history part of different ethnicities and cultures . 
  but that 's irrelevant : we 're talking about * today * . 
  when i refer to `` regional cultures '' , i am talking about minor and negligible differences like how one region has a different type of kielbasa compared to another region . 
  not extreme differences like how one region forces its women to wear burkas , while the other region accepts gender equality . 
  is that less weasel words for you ? 
  i do n't even know why you 're arguing with me about the well-established notion that poland is homogenous . 
  instead , should n't you be attacking my statement that culturally homogenous states are preferable over multicultural states ? 
  in this context , nationality refers to ethnicity . 
  that 's what the polish census calls ethnicity . 
  all census respondents were polish nationals . 
  some ( + -2 % ) declared kashubian , lithuanian , ukrainian , byelorussian or some other `` nationality '' / ethnicity . 
  look , poland is one of the most homogenous countries in the world , second only to countries like japan and the koreas . 
  sure , they have a lot of regional cultures , but those are all part of a polish macroculture . 
  98 % of polish nationals speak polish as their mother tongue , 97 % consider themselves ethnically polish . 
  this is the result of the fact that poland never experienced large-scale non-western immigration after the 1960s , like many western european countries did . 
  no , we 're talking about people who joined isis in syria and iraq , right ? 
  i bet there is not a lot of non-muslims who joined isis , lol . 
  in 2011 , 97.10 % of the people of poland claimed polish nationality , and 98.19 % declared that they speak polish at home . 
  that seems pretty homogenous to me . 
  that number is not even true , it 's too low . 
  as another commenter pointed out , the real number is 4.8 % , and 14.9 % for severe sexual assault crimes . 
  keep in mind that refugees are , at the very most , 1.8 % of the population ( and probably less than that ) . 
  in other words , they are overrepresented by ** a factor of more than 8 ** compared to the entire german population . 
  you 're missing my point . 
  i am trying to explain that as a share of the muslim community of a country , the amount of albanian muslims that joined isis is quite low compared to countries like france and belgium . 
  i realize that . 
  however , i am of the opinion that police should allocate the money and officers required for arrests like these towards anti-terrorism monitoring . 
  police forces have limited resources . 
  why do you people always turn things into false dichotomies ? 
  why ca n't we have homogenuous countries where we ** do n't ** send thousands of men to slaughter each other every few years ? 
  poland is homogenuous , and as far as i know they are not at war with anybody right now . 
  albania is majority muslim . 
  that means the numbers per capita for the muslim community of albania are quite low , compared to the numbers per capita for the muslim communities of other european countries . 
  and because of / u/peterg92 , the enlightenment instantly spread throughout the islamic world . 
  over a billion people that were stuck in a medieval ideology suddenly and without explanation embrace humanist western values . 
  `` the platitudes , flag filters and hashtags touched me on a personal level . 
  thanks to them , i now realize that the religion i practiced every single day of my life is n't the correct value system '' , explains afghani villager karim abdullah , while burning the burqa of his wife . 
  glad the police is focusing on the `` important '' things , such as people making off-color remarks on social media . 
  instead of , you know , allocating the money and officers towards monitoring actual terrorists . 
  this is corporate virtue signalling to impress naive quinoa hipsters . 
  the only reason starbucks is doing this , is because a couple of guys in suits calculated that this will improve the company 's public image , leading to more profits . 
  i also bet that the refugees they will employ are also the refugees that would have found work anyway -- not the ones that are completely incompatible with western societies : the homebound somali women , the groups of young men loitering near train stations , the barely literate south sudanese ... 
  you 're missing the point . 
  also , nice , a fresh new copypasta . 
  having had a full-blown panic attack once after smoking a joint , i can assure you that actual weed paranoia is not fun * at all * . 
  it can not , under any circumstances , be compared to `` feeling mildly nervous after smoking a joint '' , which is the feeling you 're probably referring to . 
  yeah , sounds like he did more than just smoke weed ...

  spending a long time in a coffeeshop is really common in the netherlands , but for different reasons . 
  there is a step inbetween : in many european countries , townhouses ( terraced houses ) are the standard . 
  haarlem , in the netherlands , is pretty great . 
  it 's in a convenient location , next to the dunes and close to the sea , just west of amsterdam and schiphol airport . 
  it 's not too big or too small : 200k people live in and around the city , which means all important facilities and infrastructure are present , without it being an overcrowded metropole . 
  it 's got a beautiful historic city center , and most of its suburbs are also pre-wwii neighborhoods . 
  there 's a lovely river that meanders through the city , lots of historic buildings ( most notably a lot of * hofjes * and a huge-ass church ) . 
  plenty of jobs too , since it 's so close to amsterdam . 
  there 's also a great local indie music scene , and lots of quirky things happening . 
  i loved living there . 
  none . 
  dutch cities are n't really comparable with north american cities .
