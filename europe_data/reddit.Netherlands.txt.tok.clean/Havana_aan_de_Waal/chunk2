  french and german start being taught in first and second grades of secondary school , respectively . 
  ( ages 11-13 , there is no middle school in the dutch education system ) . 
  you can drop either french or german after the third grade of secondary school , but not both . 
  in some schools there are also electives for languages like frisian ( the other language native to the netherlands ) , spanish , russian , chinese , etc. 
   do you guys have animated adult stuff i do n't think i have seen anything animated ( be a tv show or movie ) from europe that 's strictly aimed at adults ? 
  i ca n't think of anything like that , no . 
  but i do n't really watch tv , so i am not really in the loop with tv series . 
  the dutch east indies are a very important , defining part of dutch history . 
  the east indies were an important influence on dutch culture , cuisine , the economy and demographics . 
  most people here have at least one friend or colleague that is `` indo '' ( people from indonesia whose family had ties to the colonials , mostly through intermarriage ) . 
  even for people with adhd ? 
  why are the swedish social democrats against repealing the ban ? 
   so , what 's the big difference between londoners and parisians or berliners ? 
  an important difference between the various cultures of europe is the demeanor , the taboos , the way of communicating ( not just language !, 
  ) , political opinions , world view , s the social cues that are used , and so on . 
  true , europeans tend to form one macroculture with many similarities , but the differences between the various cultures ** within ** that macroculture are still immense . 
  remember that on reddit , you are mainly interacting with young , highly educated europeans that are very `` deep '' into internet culture . 
  but compared to the rest of their countrymen , european redditors often are n't very representative of the average . 
  also remember that participating in the same online spaces and consuming media from other cultures does n't mean that our own cultural backgrounds are suddenly gone . 
  even though you 'll probably be able to `` get '' the broader , more superficial strokes of my culture were you to move to the netherlands , a lot of intricacies , nuances and cultural ideas will be lost on you . 
  culture is not just confined to the immediately visible `` technicolor '' aspects , such as festivals , dress , food and music . 
  there is much more to it . 
  this is called `` deep culture '' in antropology . 
  [ here is an infographic ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/79/6e/f7/796ef7089ca858a882463189199de6ce.jpg ) on the difference between deep culture and surface culture . 
  out of curiosity , have you been to europe ? 
  and if yes , where have you been ? 
  the netherlands effectively has an election treshold of 0.66 % ( you need to get at least a single seat out of the 150 seats available ) . 
  i support this low treshold , because in my opinion it makes it easier for new ideas and new parties to get representation , which in turn generates more interest in that particular party 's platform . 
  it is kind of hard to stay in the news as a political party when you do n't have any seats in the parliament . 
  because , thus far , democracy has been proven to be by far the ** best ** tool to create more stable and prosperous cultures . 
  suspension of elections is a route towards single-party oppression . 
  also , you have to understand that many european democracies are not two-party systems ; and hence there are many more lines of disagreement than just `` the populist right versus the rest '' . 
  the dutch house of representatives has 12 different parties and an additional 5 independent factions in it at the moment !, 
  and this does not even account for the many , many factions within the five or so `` ideological big tent '' parties . 
  there is no single party even close to having an absolute majority of the people behind it . 
  this means that dutch political culture is based on compromise and agreement , ** even ** with the populist parties . 
  secondly , many of these populist right-wing parties claim to safeguard this very stability and prosperity you 're talking about by stopping the fragmentation of society and preserving an homogenuous national identity . 
  whether you agree with the effiacy or moral validity of this method is yet another question . 
  that is the easiest route towards civil war . 
  democracy is holy and suspending it for pragmatic goals is still evil and very dangerous . 
  the right-wing `` populist '' wave will also not pass , as long as the current establishment governments do n't address concerns about immigration among their constituencies . 
  what languages do you speak ? 
  what academic qualifications do you have ? 
  what kind of job do you hold , and what kind of job do you want to have over here ? 
  i have not even the slightest clue what that means . 
  [ here is a non-exhaustive list of these interjections in many european and non-european languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross-linguistic_onomatopoeias#scream ), 
  likewise , emotions and feelings too are modernist fuckery from across the pond . 
  a true northern european expresses him - or herself solely through alcohol and silent , but meaningful nods . 
  the contrast is insane , it is right next to two of the most beautiful cities of the netherlands : haarlem and amsterdam . 
  zoetermeer is probably the biggest city in the nl i have never been to . 
  i nominate [ ijmuiden ] ( http://static.zoom.nl/d2cfcf1d0082a5b6ddf473a952bba775-ijmuiden-zicht-op-tata-steel.jpg ) , just west of amsterdam and north of haarlem , in noord-holland . 
  and to think that the architecture/urban planning are n't even the worst part of rotherham . 
  where do you live that you get jumped multiple times in your life ? 
  i barely know any people that such a thing happened to even once . 
   i think there 's also a possibility of her increasing the vote when faced with a center-right candidate , because most of her voter base are voting fn because they want socialist policies . 
  it is certainly possible . 
  in the netherlands , there are a lot of voter defections in both directions between the socialist party and the party for freedom ( = geert wilders ) . 
  this is because their voter bases consist of low-income , native dutch voters with a preference for `` strong '' policies . 
  it is actually a capital offense to accuse someone of being belgian here . 
  we drown offenders in polder ditches . 
   no , denmark has n't anything to do with being dutch ( why do americans think so ? ), 
  i got this too . 
  i was staying at a friend in the us , and we went to a outdoorsy get-together with her family . 
  i made small talk with someone , and , after hearing my accent , she asked where i was from . 
  so i said `` i am dutch '' , thinking that would do . 
  immediately she gleefully said : `` oh you 're from denmark !, 
  i love denmark ! '', 
  it will largely depend on her opponent 's political colour . 
  a centre-right candidate will mean she will lose badly . 
  a left-wing candidate on the other hand ... 
  it is within the realm of possibilities . 
  i expect her to make the second round of the presidential elections . 
  after that , all bets are off . 
  there are a couple of things that this will all depend on : - how much she is able to distance herself from her father , who was much more notorious . 
  - whether her opponent in the second round will be left-wing or centre-right . 
  her chances increase exponentially if she faces a left-wing candidate , because it could mean that all the centre-right voters flock to her instead of choosing for four more years of hollande politics ( whose approval ratings are ** extremely ** low ) . 
  - and the wildcard of course is whether we 'll see another terrorist attack or not . 
  a second multi-location , urban guerilla-style attack , similar to the 2nd paris attacks , will favour her on a long-term basis . 
  ( not short-term , because , counter-intuitively enough , there is always a temporary peak in the approval ratings of the government right after a terrorist attack ) . 
  jean-marie le pen was much more notorious than his daughter though . 
  they are even trying to force him out of fn to clear up their image . 
   any that wo n't charge tuition for non-eu students . 
  no such thing . 
  all european countries charge high tuition fees to non-eu citizens . 
   i would rather study overseas , apply for their citizenship , and join their air force now . 
  i remember reading that it is hard for recent immigrants to get the security clearance to serve in a foreign air force . 
  which country were you thinking of immigrating to ? 
  have you ever been to europe before ? 
  my house is from 1923 , so almost a century old yes . 
  what do you mean ? 
   it 's actually kind of a fashion for middle-aged women now to have short hair in a bright color hahaha kortpittig, 
  not many people view azerbaijan as part of europe , if they have even heard of it let alone know where it is located . 
  as for turkey , only the part west of the bosporus is seen as part of europe . 
  as for kazakhstan : it is even further away than turkey and azerbaijan for most europeans , and the people over there are genetically a mix of east asians and europeans i believe . 
  so that might historically play a role in the perception of it being european or not . 
  nowhere is safe from the us election . 
  not even / r/askeurope . 
  what do you mean ? 
  is n't that a violation of states ' rights ? 
  i though conservative voters considered states ' rights a very important thing ?
