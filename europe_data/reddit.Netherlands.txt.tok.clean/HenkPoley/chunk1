go tell that too the swiss . . they have excellent roads btw . 
  nah , putin just wants all russian speaking areas to come back to the motherland . 
  he should have just tried to buy it though , or some years long advertisement campaign in eastern ukraine . 
   it is probably also enough to trigger worldwide doom scenario . 
  [ there are some other large cities there ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_and_towns_in_russia_by_population ) . 
  more than a dozen is uhm . . overkill anyways . 
  [ carl sagan has some wise words on this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6ozuj3hgb4 ) . 
  [ some more ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdymlq7ny_m#t=311 ) . 
  [ what could have happened , and essentially can still happen today ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident ) . 
  / u/not _ cia has been afk for a while . 
  the wonders of communism , economic efficiency is n't one of them , 
  if you put 1 in 10 black men in prison , no wonder the `` raised by single parent '' is so high . 
  [ look over here ] ( http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=murder+weather+temperature&amp;btng=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2c5 ), 
  so basically since december 2011 things have only become better ? 
  the ` weed smoking dutch ' is something foreigners keep alive . 
  just as in other countries where it legalized , the dutch smoke less and less weed over the years . 
  just * never ever * tell them that . 
  just pretend it 's northern germans speaking in dialect . 
  if lots more men cheat than women . 
  then there have to be women who cheat a lot ( more outside partners ) . 
  simple numbers game . 
  ( given that homosexuality is sort of at the 5 % level for both genders , we can assume that the overhead of male cheaters are not having gay sex with each other . ), 
  clicks in with the results from okcupid , where 80 % of men were rated below average by heterosexual women . 
  sort of as if men have to compete with women on the scale of desirability . 
  src : http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-looks-and-online-dating/, 
  looks like if both genders had equal cultural suppression it would end up at around 50-55 % . 
  or maybe the german women are really taken aback by their partners beer belly . 
  twin studies came up with 55 % chance of one of the twins had sex outside their relationship . 
  seems about right  ( aka , the same as not being twins ) . 
  ca n't come up with the paper , but it should be by [ tim spector ] ( https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fik--deaaaaj&amp;hl=nl&amp;oi=ao ) . 
  on the other hand , the data is collected by [ gleeden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleeden ) a site similar to ashley madison . 
  so they have some economic incentive to make it seem more common . 
  [ more like ] ( https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=722&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=riding+dog&amp;oq=riding+dog&amp;gs_l=img.3...11676.11676.0.11900.1.1.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.img..1.0.0.kakrrwyimaq ) ? 
  you mean , [ like this ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=dog+in+stroller&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cceqsarqfqotclqzjnz98sycfyxsfaodwlmlkg&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=722 ) ? 
  as i understand it greece actively hid their huge deficits and loans with help of goldman sachs . 
  do n't think you can do much about that , if it was done smart enough . 
  thats another angle . 
  but be sure to note that there 's a whole list of countries , up to france even , that at some point while already in the eu were not qualified to join , if re-examined at that time . 
  france is a pretty big tentpole country of the eu . 
  at some point we will need to face it that even in the usa , another monetary union , the rich states share about 5 % -8 % of their gdp with the poorer states just to keep them afloat . 
  which is sort of similar to the amount of money that 's needed to keep poor people afloat within a country ( social securities ) . 
  so hard-lining that no money will go to greece means basically that someone does not want a european monetary union . 
  one reason is that the bible does n't write about vaccinations . 
  but then stuff like cars and computers are n't in there either . 
  with 25 % less people to enact the plans , it would n't be quite ` exactly as planned ' . 
  if you are so concerned about them , maybe you should call in here : http://www.brussels.be/artdet.cfm?id=5212&amp;, 
  are they homeless ? 
  if you do n't know , then please refrain from speaking :p, 
  still , with less legal guns around it 's more obvious that the guns you do see are to be confiscated by the police . 
  the thing is , these recent attacks were sort of unplanned . 
  the actual planned attacks were supposed to happen this easter ( next sunday ) . 
  so in a way , he would n't have known , even if questioned more . 
  and the police , who are trained and paid professionals to handle these cases . 
  well , it 's the country next to syria . 
  syria has several internal violence problems ( seperatists , daesh , assad , . . ) that the world mostly ignored between '08 - ' 14 . . 
  yeah , with free access to guns the people in this video would clearly have less guns in their possession . 
  yeah , but it 's not very easy to end up with sufficient radioactive material . 
  also , such a ` dirty bomb ' mostly reaches as far as a normal bomb already would . 
  the additional nuisance is extra precautions with cleanup of the near vicinity . 
  with most radioactive substances , as long as you are not trying to ingest it , or are next to a rather large pile of it , you 'll be fine . 
  that they hide their face with a cover it 's pretty obvious that they know inside what they are doing is wrong . 
  the way to a man 's heart is through his stomach . 
  they take personal space very seriously : https://i.imgur.com/fpv0whf.jpg, 
  soon they 'll begin with reservations for fibre internet around here . 
  suppose that will shave off a bit of the 15-19ms of adsl latency i 'm currently seeing ( peak 50ms under load ), 
   perhaps because they do n't need as much data . 
  well , ( in 2011 ) the netherlands had the densest use of twitter in the whole of europe ( maybe apart from ankara , afaik ) : https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/5912946760/in/album-72157627140310742/ we are pretty wel connected . 
  fixed line ? 
  what 's the bufferbloat like ? 
  1 ms ping ? 
  you set up a server on your local lan ? 
  what does http://speedtest.dslreports.com say about bufferbloat on that line ? 
  ( i suspect that 's a fixed line and not mobile ), 
  you heat at night ? 
  is n't that disruptive for your sleep ? 
  ( yes ), 
  in 2009 the european commission was so nice to publish in a [ report ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/doc/factsheets/14thimplementation/14th-progress-report-nl-final.pdf ) that the dutch had one of the cheapest phone plans in europe . 
  for some reason a year later that was no longer the case . 
  i 'm not sure why -_- though if you pay enough , have a landline too , and live together ( !, 
  ) , you can get reasonably priced plans with large data bundles ( meaning : our high end & low end cost nearly the same ) . 
  there 's also some pressure from people living in the countryside , they would really like to have something better than end-of-the-line adsl data rates ( 4 mbit/s or so ) . 
  so there are some tests with 4g dataplans in the 50-80gb / month range . 
  there are movies like interstellar , where even a native speaker might want subtitles , because of the ehm . . artistic freedom . . of the producer mixing loud music over the spoken word . 
  you mean : speciesist, 
  it 's 17th century dutch , with centuries of separate drift from how it 's nowadays spoken in the netherlands . 
  also : * the * netherlands . 
  in the netherlands we had a period in the 90s when about a third of the youth dressed like that . 
  called themselves `` gabbers '' . 
  there now is a hybrid called liquid democracy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delegative_democracy basically you may delegate your vote on a particular subject to a subject expert who was elected or advices the parliament . 
  i think we spotted the geert wilders voter . 
  `` if i had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . '' - henry ford in the mean time the other eu countries try to work on better cooperation . 
  which is the thing that brings economic progress , doing work for eachother . 
  on any referendum people will vote the ` against ' vote . 
  change management is hard . 
  common people do n't notice what the union brings them . 
  so sure , if you do a referendum people will vote to leave the eu . 
  they would also vote against any other change . 
  ( nb : the above is true , unless you carefully cultivate a debate culture first ), 
  and view it from the side of the other eu countries , each time this rich bratty country comes around that they _ need _ special exemptions . 
  well , go then .
