  that 's the defining moment in islamic history halted the islamic golden age of culture and science . 
  the timurids were muslims but fell in the tradition of other nomad empire , notably the mongols who they considered themselves the inheritors / restorers of . 
  the blame of these conquests is not religion but culture . 
  nomad hordes will be nomad hordes . 
  some area 's never fully recovered from the invasions or got weakened and taken over by others . 
  it 's pretty reasonable to place the blame on the hordes , not muslims in general . 
  ah yeah , the great mongol and timurid retaliation for . . 
   where the middle east is mostly a product of islam . 
  well that and devastating invasions from both the west and the east , very complex geopolitical dynamics , both religious and tribal struggles and regular conquests from every direction it 's more than just islam . 
  same goes for europe, 
  depends , if we get a coalition with wilders you 'll be able to vote next year :'), 
  cda has n't been religious for several decades now . 
  it has its roots in christian parties , but it 's usp 's are being the farmers party , strongly pro-eu and moderately conservative . 
  as a former active member of that party , the ` christian ' aspect of the party is not relevant anymore also : pvdd is not populist at all , it 's a ( mostly ) one-issue party . 
  there 's a big difference between that and populists, 
  the squeaks of my bike soothe me and refresh my spirit . 
  a bike that does n't squeak ca n't be trusted, 
  the squeaks of my bike soothe me and refresh my spirit . 
  a bike that does n't squeak ca n't be trusted, 
  apparently not enough to convince our government though . 
  dunno , honestly i do n't really care but the least i can do is trust the decisions of our government as they usually do a good job, 
  makes sense , although it probably depends on different expectations from both countries . 
  i assume that romanians want to join and improve the corruption stuff , where the netherlands probably want romania to improve before joining or something like that . 
  that constanta harbor thing sounds interesting though , what is that about ? 
  that 's not the reason at all . 
  the reason is that romenia and bulgaria failed to meet criteria on criminal and corruption statistics and most importantly ** failed to show an adequate plan of improvement ** . 
  that means our government did n't trust your countries to take the necessary steps to improve and eradicate corruption . 
  i honestly do n't understand how you could even try to blame this on the netherlands . 
  it sucks to live in a corrupt country , but it has to have consequences if the eu is going to stay as good as it is now . 
  do you people really see this as our fault instead of your own ? 
  would you bother to explain why that is ? 
  seems pretty odd to me, 
  obvious troll is obvious, 
  a lot of imams in turkish mosques in the netherlands are appointed by the turkish government , surely that helps in creating a more onesided view on things . 
  the mosques that do n't appoint a state official as imam are generally ( not always ) more open-minded and progressive . 
  euro 's are glorified friendlies , right ? 
  now the wc , that 's where it 's at jk we 're gon na fuck that up too, 
  coffee-culture as in doing fancy stuff with it or just drinking a lot of it ? 
  i disagree , it would kill of the 2nd tier of football clubs in both luxemburg and belgium . 
  destroy a lot of rivalries too, 
   then it must enforce the proposition like singapore does i hope not, 
   or even had a colony . 
  actually , about that . . they had some sand in namibia and i 'm pretty sure i 've got a german new guinea colonial company share somewhere in a box here . 
  woah that sucks man , did someone get fired over that ? 
  huh , what was the problem ? 
  no , all ukip did was misspend money which they got for a certain purpose . 
  it 's fraud , theft and illegal . 
  there should be consequences for that . 
  if i give you a thousand euro and make you sign a document where you promise me you 'll only use it to pay your rent , but you go to a music festival with that , obviously i 'm going to get angry with you . 
  can someone post that lee mack bit about irish names ? 
  some of the stuff in the bookshop is available in all eu languages or at least the major ones . 
  that 's an oddly specific acronym, 
  actually they have thousands of hadith too, 
  thanks mate , that 's genuinely interesting, 
  but why, 
  wait , just butter ? 
  that 's pretty normal though, 
   i bet it 's double whammy , as in , more people in minorities do crimes and police is n't even touching any cases where the suspect could cry `` racism '' . 
  doubt it, 
  that 's actually quite popular to say but not true . 
  but even then : not the eu 's business , imho . 
  edit for other reasons : why the downvotes ? 
  did i break some rules ? 
  eh about $ 311/month , excluding gas , water , electricity and internet . 
  not that bad as i get a ` huursubsidie ' , basically about $ 200 from the state to help me pay rent . 
  the 21m2 includes a kitchen , toilet and shower so i do n't have to share . 
  quite a good deal for student housing . 
  i 'm 21 and i rent a 21m2 room from a student housing corporation . 
  i do n't intend to buy a house too soon ( nor will i be able to ) , as it 'd mean i 'd ` chain ' myself to a particular place and not be able to move freely . 
  in a couple decades i 'd like to buy though . 
  tell you what , i 'm actually considering doing that . 
  i really should just finish this study for once . 
  you 're quite optimistic . 
  it turned out the makers payed some criminals to stage everything , according to the mayor of amsterdam . 
  national geographic denied everything , but will not show it again , basically admitting it was fake by doing so . 
  the difference between de jure and de facto is massive though . 
  it 's true though , taxes on products are a joke in germany . 
  the 28th of december i drove to germany to buy cheap liquor , tobacco , meat and fireworks . 
  fireworks are like 50 % cheaper for the exact same thing , liquor is priced the same as it is in dutch online stores , but i buy it in physical stores over there . 
  got a $ 10 fine for driving too fast , would 've cost me $ 40 in the netherlands at the very least . 
  shit 's cheap , yo . 
  very good list , i 'd suggest adding maybe johan de witt for his massive ( ! ), 
  contributions to the position of the netherlands in europe . 
  ** johan de witt ** he was considered to be one of the greatest politicians of his age , propelling the netherlands to the front of european politics . 
  he created an huge fleet which was called `` the fleet of johan de witt '' by his peers . 
  he appointed de ruyter as an admiral and ordered him to initiate the raid on the medway , which won the 2nd anglo-dutch war for the netherlands . 
  he fixed the state finances . 
  he did important shit . 
  well , he obviously is fluent in english . 
  just not in any * other * language , most likely . 
  wait , there are jackals in the balkan ? 
  i think there was a stereotype of the portuguese in the netherlands a couple centuries ago when we where fighting them for the spice trade , but since then there 's nothing . 
  same in the netherlands . 
  peope forget that the netherlands as a whole are and can be pretty conservative and down to earth . 
  a pretty good example is the saying `` doe maar normaal , dan doe je al gek genoeg '' which rougly translates `` behave normal , that 's already crazy enough . '', 
  dutch tolerance is not acceptance , it 's tolerance . 
  i do n't care if you smoke weed or want to get married with men or want to have an abortion or euthanasia , as long as you do n't bother me with it . 
  those spices do look profitable , if only we could have some of it . 
  or maybe all of it . . 
  nope , she 's real .
