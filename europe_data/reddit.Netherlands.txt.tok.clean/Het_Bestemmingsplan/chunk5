  the netherlands are a huge trade partner for russia and invest a lot in them . 
  dutch groups are among the largest investors in russian agricultural projects . 
  putin has to make a stand and show the world and more importantly the people of russia that they are a powerful country so he uses harsh words against the dutch government , but at the same time he ca n't be too harsh because russia and the netherlands need each other . 
  it 's not worth risking the decent relations with the netherlands , especially because the netherlands are considered to be a so called ` multiplier country ' in the eu . 
  that basically means that the dutch opinion on matters is usually considered to be important . 
  if the netherlands agree or disagree with something , it makes other countries much more likely to agree or disagree . 
  ( source : the leaked cables on wikileaks a couple of years ago had the american ambassador to the netherlands explain this in detail to his superiors . ), 
  being too harsh might mean there are consequences in the eu , which as a whole is by far the biggest trade partner of russia with about 50 % of total trade . 
  i can imagine why he 'd be rather careful when discussing matters with the dutch king , especially after recent events . 
  true , nobody in their right mind wants to secede . 
  this is better . 
  to be fair , it ** is ** best . 
  dude , what ? 
  you do know zwarte piet was a slaver , not a slave , right ? 
  well , the netherlands and russia are currently battling it out diplomatically if i can trust the newspapers on this one , so the winner gets him ? 
  racism is the belief that some characteristics are part of belonging to a race and the belief that races can be ranked . 
  `` better '' vs. `` worse '' or `` intelligent '' vs. `` barbarian '' would be examples of this . 
  nowhere does he give this impression . 
  he only says he is more likely to be careful when he sees non-white people he does n't know in a country where non-white people are much more likely to commit a crime than white people . 
  that 's common sense . 
  heidelberg is extremely close to where you 're driving , check it out . 
  beautiful city . 
  it 's still too long to see anything , you 'll literally be driving more than seeing the cities . 
  i 'd suggest dropping the swiss and italian cities , save them for another time to give them the time they deserve . 
  italy warrants an own roadtrip itself , you included verona and venice but honestly , most cities in italy are worth visiting ( like milan , torino , genova , bologna , cremona , firenze , pisa and dozens more ) . 
  same goes for france , switzerland , belgium and to a lesser degree the netherlands and germany ( the war left it 's marks on a lot of historical cities in the latter two countries . 
  there are many , many beautiful places left but less than in the other countries mentioned ) . 
  my advice : keep it simple . 
  in france , visit paris ( it 's much closer than most of the cities you chose ) . 
  in germany , visit cologne and trier , maybe heidelberg if you really feel like driving ( which you apparently do ) . 
  in the netherlands , check out maastricht , amsterdam , maybe utrecht . 
  yeah , 15 % is the maximum over here , so a lot of stuff is sold at 14.9 % . 
  not 45 % stuff like in germany though . 
  the dutch go to germany for cheap alcohol . 
  i mean , distilled spirits are sold there in the supermarkets !, 
  fucking heaven right there . 
  actually the netherlands too . 
  in my village ( 35k inhabitants ) we do n't have a single traffic light , only roundabouts . 
  pretty convenient . 
  not 100 % about this . 
  i was born in germany and lived there for about 13 years , when we moved back to the netherlands the schools where definitely better than the two i went to in germany . 
  my level of english is n't particularly high but still much better than the german friends i still have . 
  some countries are better on average than others , but i agree with you that the german level is over all pretty good . 
  noted . 
  aflossingsvrije hypotheken did n't have to be paid , only the interest . 
  the loans where disallowed on the first of this year . 
  well that 's something to be proud of . 
  exactly , this is a very real dilemma , especially if you have to cycle for more than twenty minutes . 
  ikea actually sells it over here , it 's pretty good . 
  together with some berries or something . 
  partially , yeah . 
  in the netherlands it 's usually a bit more crowded though , it 's flat but with a lot of villages and farms between . 
  seeing the horizon is unusual too , because there are lots of trees next to streets and farms to catch the wind . 
  but yeah , it 's just as flat !, 
  that 's what she said too . 
  no , i just do n't think it 's flat at all . 
  it 's mountainous , i do n't get how he can say it is n't . 
  you guys took macau back or something ? 
  or read goethe and schiller , on that matter . 
  it 's a pretty sweet language . 
  do n't consider the chinese to be lazy at all . 
  more like introvert , the chinese over here are generally held in higher regards than the turks and moroccans , but they definitely do n't mix with the population like them . 
  yeah , i knew someone who smoked $ 400 worth of weed a week . 
  kind of an eye opener really , i think he quit it when he realised just how much that was . 
  do n't forget to tour the 11 cities of friesland as well ( more like villages , really . ) . 
  oh oh oh and check the waddenzee . 
  oh and buy yourself some s\u00fbkerb\u00f4le and beerenburg . 
  yeah , me too . 
  i mean i could probably name the majority of them , but pointing them out would be pretty hard ( except for really obvious ones like california , texas , florida , ny , new mexico , michigan etc. 
  jan van speijk too , btw . 
  exactly . 
  four hundred year old farms and buildings are pretty common , they 're old but not * extremely * old . 
  ah , thanks . 
  not the smartest people around . 
  what . 
  300 in denmark , 4 in the netherlands ? 
  what ? 
  yeah , fifteen minutes usually was the time we waited before going home . 
   two criminals went to a police station and admitted stealing some cash because they were afraid of the victim who found out where they lived huh . 
  no worries , after the war you 'll have at least one apache helicopters or so . 
  exactly , which is why it 's so hard to tell if this is accurate . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are tons of local agencies tweeting things over here , it 's very decentralised . 
  is the royal family more popular in walloni\u00eb or vlaanderen ? 
  the former queen of the netherlands travelled a lot to foreign countries with ` handelsmissies ' , which means she was usually accompanied by business men from several big companies with an interest in that particular country . 
  quite a few deals have been made that way . 
  ah alright , makes sense, 
  what do you mean ? 
  the belgian economy ( gdp and shadow together ) is n't bigger than the german , french and dutch one . 
  if you 're referring to the shadow economy , that one is bigger in percents , but only bigger than the dutch one in numbers . 
  gdp are only the officially recognized products and services , so it 's added on top of the gdp . 
  in the netherlands it 's probably low because it 's legal to do some handywork if the pay is less than a certain amount , so most of it falls under that . 
  zwart werken in dutch , exactly the same . 
  why did these people have their citizenships revoked ? 
  where they part of a minority , illegally immigrated or something like that ? 
  or a train . 
  the link seems dead , would you happen to have another one ? 
  well , if i see the news the people of greece do indeed seem to not have any euro 's at all ... 
  but he *** was n't *** austrian , or am i missing something ? 
  but they do n't overreact when someone mentions the war or hitler, 
  watch out , there are germans on this subreddit .
