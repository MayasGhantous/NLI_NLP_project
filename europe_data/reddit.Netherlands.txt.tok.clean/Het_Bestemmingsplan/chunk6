  yeah , i do n't think that pride automatically leads to idiocy . 
  poland was n't ready for something like that immediately after being free though . 
  oh well , hopefully in a few years . 
  okay . 
  op used them though , if i 'm not wrong . 
  might be because of american 1/32rd irish subscribed to the sub ? 
  just a guess but i know quite a few americans that do this . 
  i agree with this , we do n't really have the image of loud obnoxious belgians over here . 
  belgians are very cute , actually . 
  i mean , have you ever heard a flemish girl whisper shit in your ear ? 
  she could be reciting the necronomicon for all i know but it still sounds like the cutest thing ever !, 
  fair enough , never actually had the pleasure of trying those . 
  guess i 'll get a jar next time . 
  it 's the * healthiest * , not the * best * . 
  the chemicals make it tasty . 
  definitely *** not *** . 
  calv\u00e9 met stukjes noot is the one and only . 
  no , i was referring to the difference between ` proper ' butter and margarine . 
  well , as i said i could compare them to german , dutch , french , british and other tourists of the same age . 
  the swedish teenage boys really where the least manly of them all . 
  haha , they 're trying the same over here as well . 
  not gon na happen . 
  there are still several finno-ugric republics in russia , if i 'm not wrong ? 
  the mordvins and several smaller people ? 
  another one from the flevopolder ? 
  we seem to be pretty rare, 
  lidl and aldi are cheap but good . 
  the quality of the food is very decent , the meat is often better than in more expensive stores . 
  here is the [ source ] ( http://www.everyoneweb.com/worldpenissize/ ) this graph was based . 
  basically , the statistics where either self reported or measured . 
  from the top-3 penises only the dutch data are measured . 
  comfortable , easy to wear , cheap . . what 's not to love about them ? 
  i do visit farms a lot though , also good if you 're gardening . 
  one x with a protector . 
  the camera is in the middle of the phone and elevated compared to the rest of the body . 
  dropped a brick on it, 
  well , there are three different canals within a 500m radius , so there 's that . 
  but not a lot of boats , only on the big canal there are like twenty or so . 
  50/50mbps fibre , paying 40 euro/month but that 's including tv and phone . 
  considering 100/100mbps for an additional twenty euro . 
  beauty, 
  oops . 
  an alternative way to spell ulkje would be uilkje . 
  not very common though . 
  horst is used in germany as well ( horst wessel for example ) . 
  sybren , wybren , doekele , ulkje , wytse and others are frisian only as well ( though ulkje -  ulrike ) . 
  partially , they 're not all self reported . 
  quite a lot of them are measured , actually . 
  sooo ... the dutch have the longest ** measured ** penises ? 
  aw yeah !, 
  fuck esf , this is the only competition that really matters !, 
  not like that , i had one course but could use whatever i wanted on the essays , as long as it was consistent . 
  enfin , free frisia and stuff . 
  yeah basically all of western europe . 
  sounds reasonable enough , let 's gather the men . 
  well , it was an okayish long-term decision but it still sucked big time . 
  i prefer it this way though , being cheap is what gives us jobs . 
  for example , i work at a company importing stuff from austria and selling it to germany . 
  we 're cheaper than the german companies that sell the exact same product , which is the reason they do n't have a lot of customers anymore . 
  well , king radboud once captured cologne , so yeah . . let 's just take northern germany while we 're at it . 
  how about this : we take the ommelanden back from the silly lower saxon invaders and call it klein friesland . 
  huh , those downvotes are ridiculous . 
  how fucking hard is it to get this joke ? 
  `` eisen '' means `` to demand '' , it could mean that they 're ... very demanding ? 
  alright , looks interesting !, 
  i 'll take a look at the articles , thanks !, 
  well , my grandmother does . . 
  i think . 
  but yeah , hardly anyone does . 
  while we 're at it , how is the koningshuis seen in belgium ? 
  i could imagine there are differences between the flemish and walloon point of view , is it seen as a good thing in general ? 
  personal preference i guess . 
  i do n't think there really should be a song , but if there 's going to be one , it better be good . 
  yeah , i looks like we 're both wrong , apologies . 
  read too fast to check the context . 
  there 's not need for but hey , it 's `` lekker gezellig '' . 
  or so they say . 
  i 'm not against having a song for the occasion , because getting a new monarch is n't something that happens a lot . 
  something to sing along during `` het hossen '' is welcome , as long as it is n't garbage like this . 
  they should 've asked two or three artists at most , max . 
  one or two writers . 
  oh well , we might be able to reuse this at the next songfestival . 
  would fit in perfectly . 
   the song used the word `` krenken '' . 
  best translation i could come up with or find was to offend or maybe derange . 
  maybe i was a bit off there . 
  either way it 's not applicable to anything but an ancient conflict but therefore should n't be considered bad . 
  here 's the last part of the 10th couplet you 're referring to : * edel neerland zoet , * * als ik daaraan gedenke , * * mijn edel hart dat bloedt . 
  * it means the writer does n't like having to harm the spanish . 
  anyways , preferring peace and respecting the spanish is a recurring theme in the anthem but it 's not really that important . 
  most dutch do n't even know the anthem except for the first and sixth couplet , so there 's that . 
  to be honest , it 's stupid but except for the `` w van willem '' part it was n't really * bad * . 
  just stupid . 
  it 's not offending to the spanish at all , it specifically mentions the respect the rebel leader had for the spanish king , meaning they fought against the spanish , but did n't bear the spanish king ill will . 
  as for the sentence `` i of german blood '' , that translation is just plain wrong . 
  the word `` deutsch '' or `` dietsch '' used to mean both dutch and german , a few centuries ago . 
  these days , it exclusively means german but that was n't the case when the song was written . 
  you can find the word back in the english word `` dutch '' . 
  and as the frisiandude mentions , it 's not a kings song but an anthem ( though it was originally written as a song to praise willem , so in a way it could be called a stadhouder 's song ) . 
  frisian still live in the area on the map i posted , but most of them speak german , dutch or lower saxon variants these days .
