  we have channels that are government funded . 
  political parties get a few minutes of airtime on it . 
  they can show whatever they want on there as long as it does n't breech any laws . 
  wilders wanted to air it , but somehow tapes got mixed up so it did n't . 
  that 's why he has been shouting ` censorship ' . 
  it will however most definitely play in a few days , as promised by the network executives . 
  seriously . 
  everybody is like ` go ahead then , good luck ' . 
  i could n't care less what he does . 
  cheapskate trick ; when it is 9.97 pay cash , when it 's 9.98 pay with card . 
  it took way to many scrolls to finally see a comment that clarifies this . 
  in the netherlands every investment opportunity must have the disclaimer `` results from the past give no guarantee for the furture '' . 
  this is the same with these graphs . 
  nothing from the past is 100 % comparable to the situation now . 
  i 'd rather not , thank you very much . 
  why would you want that ? 
  the comment section is free entertainment, 
  a bit drastic , but it would indeed solve a lot of problems . 
  motion accepted !, 
  i am not mad at you , op . 
  i can never stay mad at you . 
  i was just venting . 
  just ... do n't do it again please . 
  `` just walk it off '', 
  i 'm allergic to peanuts . 
  are you telling me i should kill myself ?? 
  dick !, 
  i already do . 
  can we please stop with the - exits . 
  they are seriously getting on my nerves . 
  the terms i mean . 
  it 's not like they are ever going through with bailing anyway . 
  ... ^ ^ ^ thank ^ ^ ^ you, 
  i hate them . 
  just post the goddamn maps separately . 
  how the fuck am i going to compare them when they keep fucking changing ever 2 fucking seconds . 
  this is a nonsense article . 
  it was the pope actually who said the word genocide . 
  which is good news , but i fail to see what the dutch government have to do with this . 
  we are still very hesitant to call it a genocide . 
  the motion in which is urged to call it ` the armenian genocide ' instead of ` the matter regarding the armenian genocide ' did n't pass . 
  political nonsense , that is all it is . 
  guerilla gardening taken to the next level . 
  i like to live on the edge . 
  plus , i did n't think the irish would be up already . 
  you brits have never heard of the hola extension ? 
  poland ca n't into space !, 
  by top notch i mean they ride ( mostly ) on time , and you never have to wait long for the next train . 
  what i heard about the italian system ( though i have no idea if that is true ) is that this is not always the case . 
  it 's the same system as in the netherlands . 
  our rail system is government owned , but the operators are privately owned ( although in the case of the largest operator , the ns , all shares are owned by the state ) . 
  but we invest heavily in the railway system , and ( although we like to complain about them a lot ) are actually top notch and fairly cheap . 
  unless we have freezing rain . 
  than we dispose of our milk . 
  it 's * a * solution . 
  not * the * solution . 
  seriously though , if you think guns would solve this problem you need to get your head checked . 
  assaults happen even in the us of `` the best '' a. 
  pao 's back , baby !, 
  if we just call the normal police the ` crime police ' it would solve everything !, 
  would be interesting . 
  might not solve anything , but \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  blackbirds can be found in higher numbers than ` usual ' this time of year . 
  the northern populations are migrating south , while there is also a resident population . 
  the other trushes are most likely [ redwings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/redwing ) and [ song thrush ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/song_thrush ) ? 
  they can be very abundant this time of year . 
  depends a bit on your location though . 
  my neighbour brought me a duck this weekend . 
  ate the meat , now making duck soup . 
  may i ask what type of birds they are ? 
  i guess blackbirds and other trushes as you say they eat the berries ? 
  their local density can fluctuate enormously during this time of year . 
  birds migrate in waves . 
  after a few days of bad weather you can observe large flocks migrating on weather radars . 
  it could be one of those waves passing by . 
  in a few days your garden might look very different . 
  silly finland , flag of poland other way around !, 
  and indonesia wear hat !, 
  same here in the netherlands now . 
  we even had a ` the onion ' ( de speld ) article that ` gay man were so ecstatic that they will stop having sex so they can donate blood ', 
  i wonder how you guessed my age . 
  the referendum on the eu constitution did get ` misused ' to say we do n't want turkey in the eu . 
  also , local referenda do happen . 
  i 'm not saying that i hate people who have different opinions , but referenda have the large problem that people vote against current politics instead of for/against the real issue . 
  they are useless . 
  what what is ? 
  the outcome ? 
  i 'm willing to place a bet on it . 
  it does n't really matter how it is framed . 
  referenda usually result in a vote against the ruling parties . 
  that clouds the votes that are really about the issue . 
  i lost fate in direct referenda a long time ago . 
  more of a ` dutch expected to vote against eu and immigration , disguised as a referendum on ukranian treaty with no merit at all ' . 
  it 's a lot more hassle . 
  after the initial vote , the tweede kamer has to dissolve and new elections have to take place . 
  then they need a 2/3 majority in both 1st and 2nd kamer . 
  we take our constitution seriously . 
   which in turn requires a 2/3 majority in parliament . 
  in two consecutive parliaments if i remember correctly . 
  ohh i 'm shaming them alright .
