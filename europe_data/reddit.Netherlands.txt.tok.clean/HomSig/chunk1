holy shit , that 's really invasive . 
  do they do that on purpose to scare people away ? 
  it does n't matter what it 's used for , 1,7 billion is still 1,7 billion . 
  i think solid blue 'd 've been better . 
  in the netherlands it 's defiantly used as an insult . 
  an acquintance of mine told me he was surprised to hear it used normally when visiting his family in turkey , said it sounded much nicer . 
  it was not my point . 
  i just mentioned it that they were opposed it because they would n't want to do something america does n't like . 
  i get your initial objection because it 's a bit of an obscure vote and they were in favour of it the second time , but i just mentioned it to illustrate how pro-american they are ( casting doubt on / u/holmoen 's idea that sweden is even more of a lapdog ) . 
  i also do not see why it is more important that i refer to them as neoliberals . 
  while it 's true that mark rutte does n't seem to identify with any ideology or vision , people like bolkestein definitely consider themselves to be neoliberal . 
  it 's not an insult made up by left-wingers . 
  i said that the vvd voted against gay marriage because they were afraid the americans would ' t like it . 
  i gave you a source that they voted against it because they were afraid of `` international isolation '' . 
  that they changed their mind later on does n't change that at all . 
  wow , no need to get angry . 
  i gave you my source . 
  if you still refuse to believe it , then so be it . 
  if you really want ` discussions ' that are really just some insulting , then we can continue on / r/thenetherlands . 
  so you finally see that they were indeed against it and changed their mind later on ? 
  good . 
  i think it 's the most neutral position to make a map about what is the case rather than what should be the case . 
  yes , it 's a good thing they changed their mind later on . 
  see the source i added or just google it for yourself . 
  a decade ago the liberal party in the netherlands voted against gay marriage because they were afraid it would piss off the americans . 
  they are the biggest party right now . 
  edit : guys , just google it . 
  the first source you will find is [ this ] ( http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/archief/archief/article/detail/2471852/1996/04/17/kabinet-moet-recht-op-huwelijk-en-adoptie-regelen.dhtml ) . 
  okay , it was a bit more than a decade ago . 
  at the time , we had a government consisting of pvda ( labour ) , d'66 ( progressive neoliberals ) , and vvd ( regular neoliberals ) . 
  pvda and d'66 wanted gay marriage and adoption , but the coalition did n't ( why oh why ? ) . 
  gay marriage was voted in with 81 votes against 60 votes . 
  vvd-leader bolkestein and several party members of his voted against because they were afraid it would `` isolate the netherlands from the rest of the world '' . 
  the proposal regarding adoption was voted in with 83 votes against 58 votes , but it would only be carried out if there were no international objections . 
  we 'll probably be the last country to do so . 
  well , after germany maybe . 
  i 'm not sure if we can take even more . 
  the german economy is already shaking . 
  it 's like if they 're trying to be more racist than the dutch . 
  yeah , they may want taxes now , but in the future they may want even more !, 
  seriously , they should just ban taxes . 
  they 're way too expensive . 
  so newspapers go untaxed in denmark ? 
  but how do you catch them ? 
  wo n't they fly away when you get near ? 
  why should the parliament in the european capital ? 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  and it 's also really archa\u00efc to care about a symbol so much . 
  i doubt many people would care . 
  why is it such a problem to have a eu institution in germany , france , or spain ? 
  i doubt the location will give them more influence ... 
  i did n't say none of it is in europe . 
  but the biggest part of turkey is clearly in asia ( regardless what you think of cyprus ) . 
  only a very small part of turkey is in europe anyways . 
  lost in translation on your part ? 
  `` prorussische rebellen '' are n't rebels from russia , but they 're rebels who favour russia . 
  in this case , they are ukrainian . 
  so rt is correct . 
  it 's pretty ironical that you think it 's russian propaganda that there 's propaganda on both sides . 
  i do n't know about lithuania , but if you were to read a couple of dutch newspapers you would know that there is propaganda on both sides . 
  [ our previous minister president was persuaded to try a skateboard . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=gbfwlxacogw#t=51 ), 
  is that a common opinion in hungary ? 
  they 're doing the exact same thing in the netherlands . 
  and apparantly in germany too ( according to the article ) . 
  these fuckers just buy themselves out of the law . 
  fines simply do not work on them . 
  they will only stop when every potential taxi driver has a criminal record and is forbidden to ever become a real taxi driver . 
  yes , that was exactly what i was talking about . 
  thanks . 
  somehow , op managed to change `` there are open manifestations of neo-nazism '' into `` the baltic states are neo-nazi '' . 
  i do n't get why the people here on / r/europe are fine with it . 
  look op , you only wrote the title , and you still managed to put a flat out * lie * in it . 
  well , i never realised same-sex activities are banned in muslim countries . 
  i thought they banned opposing-sex activities ... 
  what 's the difference between a ban and no recognition ? 
  oh , a female minister . 
  let 's all judge her by her appearance then .

  i 'll post a map in half an hour or so . 
  the website of the reformed newspaper is offline on sundays . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://www.refdag.nl/polopoly_fs/2010_11_26_dkreg_confgemeen_1_517906!image/962668649.jpg ) it is . 
  it shows municipalities in which the confessional parties had a majority in 2010 , and the colour shows which of the three is the bigges . 
  the cda consists of christian democrats with no strong political opinions . 
  they just go wherever they can get the most power . 
  the sgp consists of the worst lunatics our country has . 
  they advocate family values , want to deny women their voting rights , and are even in favour of the death penalty . 
  the cu is calvinist too , but they do n't want to turn the netherlands into a theocracy . 
  on more realistical matters they 're the same as the sgp though . 
  i always thought these things were made up by cartoons ... 
  wow , it must be terrifying if your house is there . 
  was everybody evacuated ? 
  i think it works the same all over the eu . 
  you know that the uk actually * does * use solar power ? 
  on a very small scale , sadly . 
  it 's a shame the eu does n't throw its money at renewable energy ... 
  aww , you 're so oppressed . 
  it was probably made by the kind of person who says : `` i do n't hate gays , just people who have gay sex . '', 
  i do n't think so .
