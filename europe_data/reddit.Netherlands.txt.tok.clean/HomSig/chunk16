  well , not every day of course . 
  just once in a couple of months . 
  i hate it when russian propaganda completely ignores the fact that half the new government is n't even fascist . 
  because if there 's some bad thing on crimea , there 's no way there could be bad things elsewhere in the ukraine . 
  on top of that , the eu has pretty much lost all its remaining credibility , now it supports the coup d'etat and the nazis that are currently in the government . 
  a couple of years ago they could still pretend to be against war in europe ( that 's after all why the eu was founded ) , but now they seem to wish for an ukrainian civil war . 
  where do i find ` vocabulary ? ', 
  i tried to learn some german using duolingo , but it does n't work at all . 
  it does n't even give me a list of the words i have to learn ... 
  why ? 
  if you see how we install a nazi government in the ukraine , i do n't trust the eu with nuclear weapons either ... 
  oh look , the green party is the only party that cares about democracy enough to give us the information we need . 
  i guess that makes for an easy vote then . 
  if you want to read news about the ukraine , you 'd better not read the propaganda on / r/europe . 
  and the netherlands are fifth , as the pseudo-nordics we are !, 
  for real ? 
  mensrights and theredpill ? 
  if a woman goes to the police and says she 's been raped by her boyfriend every day during the past year , not-sweden says it 's 1 rape case , sweden says it 's 365,25 rape cases . 
  i 'm sure putin will give in to this huge pressure soon , especially if you combine it with the special olympics boycot from the uk . 
  not going to work for those giraffe murdering barbarians ( b\u00f6rkb\u00f6rkians ? ), 
  anytime soon . 
  haha , if only . 
  this fight has n't been won yet . 
  it 's a shame . 
  i bet there are many shelters which would prefer their animals to die in a more useful way than just being put down . 
  how is it a strawman ? 
  surrealistswimmer actually says that , even though it 's sensible if you want to counter involuntary prostitution , he 's still in favour of legalization . 
  to facilitate concensual prostitution . 
  i doubt it 's legal . 
  25 may is on a sunday , and in the netherlands we have too many relinuts who would n't vote on the lord 's day . 
  after all , the right to work as a prostitute is waaaay more important than the right not to be raped on a daily basis . 
  what 's the difference between a factchecker and a journalist ? 
  is the former just more competent ? 
  meh , i think you should n't comment on nice videos while drinking vinegar . 
  spying . 
  because you live on a worthless mountain ? 
  last summer . 
  just look for a house with unprotected wifi and you 're fine . 
  good . 
  fuck those giraffe murderers . 
  / r/mapporn is over there . 
  yeah right , even the most extreme of liberals do n't go as far as claiming gay rights for themselves . 
  is there even a single country that got gay marriage legalized without help from progressives and left-wingers ? 
  in the netherlands they were even against it in those times . 
  maybe sweden should make a law that says you do n't need to be bothered with rules when you 're 70 years old . 
  apparantly , a lot of people are in favour of such a rule .

  yeah , i hate it when they start every word with a capital . 
  i think they now go after the unknown particles . 
  longyearbyen , definitely longyearbyen . 
  not sure if american or walrus . 
  i did n't even know herrings can get 25 years old . 
  do n't they all die before 20 or something ? 
  on one of the fences that surround putin 's villa . 
  do you have a ream for me ? 
  fear for your life , marry some dutch person , or bring a lot of money . 
  this is getting out of hand ... 
  the dutch simply ca n't stop winning . 
  as long as there are no dangerous spiders i 'll come , too . 
  no , we 're selling only four . 
  flevoland will be given back to the sea . 
  the primaries are basically just party members voting who will be the party 's leader , are n't they ? 
  i suppose many countries already have that . 
  not going to denmark anytime soon . 
   amsterdam payed 100.000 euros for a new logo . 
  the scandal is , is that the new logo is almost identical to the old one . 
  the old logo on top and the new one on the bottom . 
  some journalists suggested that the designer got $ 100.000 , - for pressing the enter-button once , but that 's bullshit . 
  they now have a uniform style rather than the various differences they used to have , and they changed road signs etc. 
  uh , i think i should 've translated it to ` organic meat ' ( though it does not just refer to the organs ) . 
  a while back , supermarkets had the so-called ` kilo-knallers ' . 
  i 'm not sure how to translate it , but it was basically an advertisement for large quatities of cheap meat . 
  meat comsumption is pretty bad for the environment , and the animals from these ` kiloknallers ' were kind of tortured , too . 
  so an animal welfare group had a large campaign against it , with slogans like `` een dier is geen stuntartikel '' ( ` an animal is not an article . ' ), 
  and ` een kiloknaller is een kilo dier ' ( ' a kiloknaller is a kg animal ' ) . 
  they got some supermarkets to stop it . 
  but now , a while later , they have started to advertise with cheap meat again , and actually increased prices for biological meat , too . 
  ** netherlands ** - the liberal party ( vvd ) wants a special police department that only targets ethnic minorities . 
  - the danes are going to kill a perfectly healthy , 18 months old giraffe . 
  - two golden medals , one silver medal , and a bronze medal . 
  - supermarkets are making advertisements for meat again . 
  - the government wants to reduce the number of provinces from 12 to 7 . 
  - a ( dutch ) ceo from bayers , a farmaceutical business , says they only make the cancer medicines for rich western people , and not for india . 
  what ? 
  again ? 
  he 's complaining that we do n't agree enough with him . 
  i hope this damages their reputation even more than just paying the fine would have . 
  that the criminal organizations transport people to beg for them . 
  when i deleted my account a couple of years ago , it was only three days . 
  be careful though , if you come online again within the next two weeks , even if it 's only through another website that has the facebook f-buttons [ if you 're logged in automatically ] , the account will not be deleted . 
  do n't we all . 
  well , it 's a bit odd that 48 % thinks that slurs are acceptable in private , and that a 52 % majority respects sexist believes , but other than that it 's not so bad at all . 
  and then again , most people do n't claim to be progressive anyways . 
  so i do n't see why this is cognitive dissonance . 
  if i give you a cup of tea , i can predict you 're going to complain it tastes horrible . 
  unless you 're too polite of course , in that case i 'll just read the look on your face . 
  and if i send an email to a guy two villages away from my city in two days , i can predict i 'm getting an angry reply next monday about how i should n't sent emails on a sunday . 
  it also asks wether rich people should get better health care . 
  i know some people work in the pharmaceutical industry and agree , but seriously , is it worth to give people left-wing points for disagreeing ? 
  edit : economic left/right : -7.88 social libertarian/authoritarian : -6.05 so i 'm the capitalist authoritarian now .
