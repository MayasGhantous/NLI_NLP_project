  oh , we 've got our share of shitty politicians too . 
  i do n't doubt that for a second . 
  but do n't you see the contrast between de following two quotes ? 
  obama : `` the united states of america is prepared to use all elements of our power , including military force , to secure our core interests in the region , '' - in [ this ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2013/9/25/the_empire_president_jeremy_scahill_on ) un speech . 
  ploumen ( dutch minister of foreign trade ) : `` we constateren met z 'n allen , nadat er meer dan elfhonderd mensen gedood zijn in die fabrieken , terwijl ze gewoon aan het werk waren , dat we met elkaar aan de slag moeten om te verbeteren . '', 
  ( we can all conclude that , after more than 1100 people died in a collapsed factory [ in bangladesh ] , while they were working there , that we should cooperate to improve the situation . ), 
  - commenting on her negotiations with dutch companies that have factories in bangladesh , to improve their work environment and get them a higher wage . 
  wups , it seems like i stepped on some nationalist toes . 
  maybe you can give me a couple of sources for what you just said there . 
  after all , you also demand i give sources . 
  i still ca n't find the full speech , but i 've got a part of it [ here ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2013/9/25/the_empire_president_jeremy_scahill_on ) . 
  ( the video starts right after it , so you have to scroll the video back to 52:45 . 
  ** edit ** you do n't actually need to scroll back :p ), 
  there are n't many desserts in the netherlands , if any . 
  but there 's a little [ sand-drift ] ( http://www.gastenverblijf-lindeboom.nl/userfiles/image/sahara_ommen.jpg ) in my neighbourhood . 
  i usually do n't eat there , but i think the last time i did , it was bread with a baked egg . 
  it 's actually quite a nice place . 
  i love to go to the middle of it and pretend i 'm in a huge dessert . 
  it 's also called ` the sahara ' , which seems appropriate , because it 's next to a 77m high mountain . 
  the article mentions a cooperation with the nsa , so maybe it 's the same incident . 
  i ca n't find the video back at the moment , but i 'm pretty sure i 've heard obama talk about it . 
  obama just flat out says he works in the usa 's best interest . 
  and it 's okay if americans elect such a nationalist guy as president , but we should n't hope the spying ends anytime soon . 
  a couple of weeks / few months ago . 
  do you remember when the brazil president was so angry at the usa because of the industrial spying at some important brazilian companies ? 
  well , in response to that , obama said that he serves america 's best interest , and that the us would protect the flow of resources to the usa . 
  obama has already said that he thinks economic spying is ok if it helps the us economy and that the us army will come and take any resources they need if they ca n't get it in a more peaceful way , so i 'm afraid the eu parliament ca n't do much about it . 
  edit : http://www.democracynow.org/2013/9/25/the_empire_president_jeremy_scahill_on, 
  nice try , america . 
  you can keep your texas . 
  and the german border has the same . 
  for example with the cities kerkrade/herzogenrath and some cities on the german-polish border . 
  it hurts everytime i listen to it . 
  i wonder who ` se making all these lists ... it must be at least a full time job . 
  damn , got heino-rolled again . 
  nice . 
   it 's a shame they sing in english though . 
  haha , those roller skates . 
  norway will join when their oil has been burnt , and iceland will join when all edible fish are extinct . 
  what ? 
  never heard of alexander marcus ? 
  i 'm not sure how it 's in germany , but here in the netherlands , the anti-fascist action is mostly a peaceful organization . 
  i do n't think they 've ever done something worse that throwing stones to neo-nazis . 
  apart from the violence commited by infiltrants from the dutch secret service , of course . 
  edit : why is this being downvoted ? 
  ok , so does that mean that they fear competition from actual left-wingers ? 
  why do they accept that the police hunts for left-wingers ? 
  i mean , like half the seats in hamburg are for the spd , right ? 
  so they could just stop the police if they wanted . 
       \u201e personen , die augenscheinlich dem linken spektrum zuzurechnen sind `` ( links-alternative demonstrationen ) , holy shit , they really do that ? 
  what the fuck . 
  i thought the spd were left-wing themselves ? 
  do they fear competition ? 
  do n't listen too much to him , he 's just reciting some far-right mantra . 
   much of its population believes that they should join the european union , and not stay as an independent country . 
  the eu is not some new nation state . 
  the ukraine would still be independent if they 'd join the union . 
  the european union is in fact the exact opposite of nationalism , because it is the cooperation between nations even if there is no obvious short term benefit for one side . 
  it 's not every country for its own . 
   are you that insecure about your own political beliefs in that you want to censor anyone that makes you very uncomfortable ? 
  are you that insecure that you need to ask loaded questions when talking about politics ? 
  showing racist propaganda on the television only makes it more acceptable , and it makes immigrants and their children feel unwelcome . 
  it hurts our society an alot . 
  and yes , it * is * acceptable nowadays . 
  the talks about the moroccan problem and the cunt moroccans are considered valid opinions nowadays . 
  ten years ago , schools could still have their children make [ these things ] ( http://www.psdgraphics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/paper-people.jpg ) , and it was considered good to teach children tolerance , but now it is political indoctrination . 
  it 's sick . 
  yes . 
  i do n't know much about colombian politics , but here in the netherlands , they let the extreme right on the television some 15 years ago ( i think ) . 
  it was with fortuyn , a guy with a creepy personal cult , who never failed in front of his fans because he was shot . 
  ten years later , we 're stuck with the ` totally not racist but only against islam ' freedom party . 
  and it 's all right to talk about ` the moroccan problem ' , and to discuss what we should do with ` those cunt moroccans ' . 
  it 's not that i 'm against opposing views being shown on the television , but there 's a line , and hateful racist propaganda crosses that line . 
  and rightly so . 
  those sick extremists deserve no platform . 
  i think all ` journalists ' do that . 
  if the polish government already does that , then why should the british do it again ? 
  how about have the polish government do something ? 
  like , seriously ? 
  it has a big , green button , and even a green check . 
  surely , every intelligent person would choose for that . 
  i suppose it 's the same as in dutch / german , where it 's called oudjaarsavond / altjahrsabend . 
  because it 's the last evening of the old year . 
  what ? 
  and remove [ our king ] ( http://www.metronieuws.nl/_internal/gxml!0/2qijkhn0ctpwx8acoz5fxkpvtmr4nbh$ht4xafpxa88zwswchqkboodqzny191l/anp-25315336.jpeg ) ?!, 
  madness i say !, 
  oh , i did n't realize the danes can choose their king . 
  that 's already a thousand times better than in the netherlands . 
  i always wonder how they make such polls . 
  do they just pick the people who will say they support the monarchy , or do they make up the outcome ? 
  83 % of the danes do n't like democracy , does anyone actually believe that ? 
  how often must they break this ` taboo ' until even the attention seekers ca n't call it a taboo anymore ? 
  depends . 
  i guess it 's you to decide wether you think it 's a problem . 
  i mean , it was a bit silly on my part , but in the end , it 's not all that bad . 
  i failed to see that ? 
  depends .
