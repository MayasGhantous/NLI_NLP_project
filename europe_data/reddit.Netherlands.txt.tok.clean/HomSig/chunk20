  that are able to store data , you already pay a fee for the downloading . 
  this is called the ` thuiskopieheffing ' . 
  countries continue to over-use antibiotics because it gives the highest profits and they do n't care enough about the future . 
  here in the netherlands it 's so bad , even the people who pretend to be against it consume lots of meat . 
  better take some antibiotics to be sure then . 
  do n't people ever learn ? 
  gypsy is not the same as roma . 
  gypsy is an umbrella term for people who live in trailers ( ` trailers ' - often not actually trailers anymore ) , so roma are just a gypsy subgroup . 
  i think most non-roma gypsies do n't like being called roma . 
  what city did they move to ? 
  downloading music is legal in the netherlands , now what do i answer ? 
  heh , then i 'm counting flemish . 
  by that definition , my town is full of militant christians . 
  brb locking the door . 
  and nobody cares shit about the environment . 
  i guess they like to swallow the climate ` skeptic ' propaganda to feel better . 
  i 'd like the netherlands to form a union with wallonia . 
  to buy some jsfs . 
   i wonder when we 'll get to know which corrupt officials get that through . 
  i know villages with 6000 people that have a bigger station ... 
  i think driving in belgium is actually pretty okay . 
  most people stay concentrated and awoken because of the noise and all the holes in the roads . 
  why would you even bother to colour your water if you 're going to mix it with milk anyways ? 
  uhh , why are they provoking us ? 
  well , kerstman is the translation for santa claus ... even though no-one cares about him . 
  in the netherlands , they think that they believe in the only true religion ; that all other people are depraved ; that women belong at home with the kitchen and with the children , and that they should n't have a right to vote ; and many more rather fundamentalist ideas . 
  jep , still working . 
  did you check the box that asks if you want to show your flag ? 
  well , they can just read your failed jokes and trollposts . 
  nope . 
  still shows for me , it seems . 
  test post , please ignore . 
  `` circumcision is genital mutilation and should be discouraged as much as possible . 
  ... what ? 
  are you jewish , you say ? 
  ah fine , go ahead , circumcision is not bad at all . '', 
  at the moment they 're still england 's protectorates , so i guess it 's accurate . 
  it 's pretty easy . 
  just substitute moldova for moldavia and belarus for white russia and it 's ok . 
  well , y\u00f8u can just press the \u00f8-butt\u00f8n . 
  right alt + l d\u00f8es the trick t\u00f8\u00f8 ( n\u00f8 idea why it 's the l -_- ) . 
  \u00d8\u00f8\u00f8\u00f8h , n\u00f8w i get it . 
  how do you make an \u00d8 ? 
  i approve of this . 
  if you 're in holland , you can safely say holland . 
  why do you use ` what ' for the verb ` call ' , but ` how ' for ` named ' ? 
  so that 's why you pull all the nice things to the randstad . 
  than the armenians ? 
  i think we should have a test that accepts the answers in all european languages . 
  votes brigades are n't a conspiracy theory . 
  there are quite a lot of them on reddit alone ( for example : / r/shitstatissay or / r/progun ) . 
  oh i 'm sorry , i think i missed your substantive argument . 
  where can i read it ? 
  `` you are just whining and throwing ad-hominems . '', 
  did you do that on purpose as some ironic joke , or were you serious there ? 
  in other news : black tulips are no currency either . 
  ugh , i think i see it . 
  there have never been so many europeans as today , so please stop pretending we 're going extinct . 
  that image shows the population in europe will stay roughly the same / increase slightly . 
  how is that ` dying out ' ? 
  i actually think we 're being brigaded . 
  a while back there were a couple of really bad anti-gypsy threads . 
  i res-tagged all of them . 
  in the following two weeks , i saw maybe one or two of those tagged guys in other threads . 
  but then there was some anti-gypsy article again , and they all came back . 
  i 've no proof or anything , but i think there must either be a brigade , or just a rather large group of lurkers who post only when they see some room for racist comments . 
  how could europe die out ?!, 
  europe is one of the most populated areas on earth , only after a couple of regions in asia . 
  wow . 
  it 's amazing how such figures can spawn so much hate and racism . 
  and for the next minute , you 're breathing their exhaust gasses . 
  in the netherlands , they passed a law that says you can only advertise medicines with proven results . 
  so now our shops are full of homeopatic medicines , but no-one knows what they 're supposed to do because the label does n't tell . 
  [ actually , it 's true . 
  ok , i tried really hard , and now i 'm able to hear ` tuu-elliet ' . 
  i suppose you hear this mythical d at the hyphen ? 
  i was so excited when you could understand what i wrote , but now i think i would n't be able to learn danish after all . 
  do you hear a d on that website i linked to ? 
  well , i usually just assume the people i speak with are n't retarded and are thus able to understand their own mother tongue . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.translate.com/english/tydeligt/5571894 ) website it 's pronounced like ` tuulliet ' . 
  in dutch , we have the verb * waaien * . 
  it means * to blow * , like the wind does , so ` het waait ' = ` it ( the wind ) is blowing ' . 
  now what happens if you say it in the past tense ? 
  one hoi is enough in either case . 
  but for hello , you can also say hoi hoi . 
  so we 're in fact the opposite of danish . 
  :d nice . 
  you got it right . 
  the word ` maar ' means either ` but ' or ` only ' , so ` je zegt dat maar ' = ` you only * say * that ' / ` that 's what * you * say ' . 
  yeah , but in dutch you can do it for nearly every noun . 
  small computer = computertje , small train = treintje , etc. 
  we can even do both , small small child = klein kindje . 
  we do the same in dutch ( use the same word for hello and goodbye ) . 
  the sp is not radical . 
  oh quit with the climate skeptic nonsense already . 
  it 's getting worse and worse , and the majority of the people does n't care shit . 
  beeldje noumaarniks , want me spelling is allemachies veul bitter as de jounes . 
  enje kennie geeneens de g zegge man . 
  they talked so odd on the radio to be understood more easily . 
  people did n't actually talk like that .
