  well , you 'd better inform him then . 
  from the city of gelre / gelderen , which is german now ( it 's called geldern in german ) . 
  in dutch they 're also called * pepernoten * . 
  it happened a while ago in some village . 
  someone threw stones at a pvv politician 's house ( or rather his parents ' house ) . 
  in dutch , i call it ` ad ' if part of an e-mail address , but otherwise i say apenstaartje ( monkey tail ) . 
  speak for yourselves . 
  it all depends whom he is replaced by when he dies or falls ill . 
  because the sd want more funding for asylum seekers . 
  how dare the government protect asylum seekers ? 
  it is to my understanding that isra\u00ebl outlaws illegalsettlementdiscrimination . 
  le gmos are science and therefore good . 
  of course the reactions would all be as sour as a citron . 
  i hated it when das ( badger ) died . 
  he was my favourite animal . 
  i 'm sure that putin will change his mind soon now . 
  at the start , yes . 
  ` warum bin ich so fr\u00f6lich ' at the end is a woman . 
  i 'm just explaining why a lot of cda voters stopped voting . 
  i ca n't imagine many people actually care about the lawyers ' opinion on this matter . 
   and yes , religion has no place in politics . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it could 've been even better if there had been no trade ban . 
  in the netherlands , we have three christian parties , the cda ( christian-democrats , comparable to the german cdu but more to the right ) , the cu ( chrsitian-union ) , and the sgp ( calvinist party ) . 
  the cda used to be quite big , but now they 're a minor party . 
  their voters are quite old , and a lot of them recently stopped voting because the party co\u00f6perated with the pvv ( the racist party ) . 
  we do n't have any muslim parties on the national level . 
  there have been a few tries , but they all failed due to a lack of support . 
  a few weeks ago there were talks to ban muslim parties from national politics , but i do n't think anything like that will actually happen . 
  we do n't have separation of state and church in the netherlands . 
  that 's quite expensive , i wonder how much more hospitals they will have to close for financial reasons . 
  some people are still mad at the germans , even young people . 
  he 's called alfred jodocus kwak in dutch and german . 
  pico bello . 
  hmm ? 
  it 's the same singer , herman van veen . 
  he translated it himself , too . 
  you can find them all on youtube . 
  the german word * heute * is stressed on the first syllable , so a direct translation would n't fit in the meter . 
  die nationale kr\u00e4henpartei . 
  alfred j. kwak also had japanese animators . 
  i had forgotten most as well , though i distinctly remember the national-crow party marching through the streets . 
  it was really scary . 
  jep , he 's dutch . 
  he also voiced professor paljas in the dutch cartoon as well as in the german one . 
  i could never understand him as a child because he 'd mix too much german into it . 
  finally , a voice of reason amidst this mess . 
  i wished we had such people in the netherlands !,

  oh , i did n't mean you specifically . 
  i just noticed an increased amount of immigration stuff posted outside the megathread this morning . 
  it did n't seem to unlikely that you used to post to coontown considering that you frequent / r/european as well . 
  god , the lot of you are overly active since the coontown ban . 
  trying to spam the frustration away ? 
  i 've tagged op as a coontown regular . 
  you 're no longer calvinist if you miss a single church service , yet you are jewish to the tenth generation . 
  * netherlands * germany ( holiday ) * denmark ( holiday ) * sweden ( holiday ) * norway ( holiday ) * poland ( just a single day right at its german border ) * tsjechia ( a day in praag ) * zwitserland ( visiting family ) * belgium ( traffic jam ) * france ( holiday ) * spain ( education related ) * italy ( in middle school ) * greece ( holiday ) * uk ( holiday ), 
  the problem many municipalities in the netherlands face is , that the national government keeps giving them tasks and obligations without giving money to execute them . 
  so now they 're desperate for effici\u00ebncy gains . 
   c1 : can express ideas fluently and spontaneously without much obvious searching for expressions . 
  so i do n't even speak my first language fluently according to this system . 
  no idea . 
  dutch schools do n't teach vector calculus anymore and in university we use english book because they 're cheaper . 
  edit : from what i remember , the dotcomma was only used when the comma could be confusing , much like you only use [ ] when ( ) could be confusing . 
  if you 're worried you can make it ( 34,29 ; 804,37 ) . 
  if the gov ' t tries to take my grenades , i 'll just 3d print them . 
  if everybody had a grenade , this would never have happened . 
  what ? 
  how can a watch be that expensive ? 
  that 's about $ 570 , - . 
  quite a lot , but he could 've saved up for it . 
  every politician who votes against renewable energy in favour of renewunable energy will have to drive a prius . 
  wooohooo finally !, 
  the 5 euro coin is all i ever wanted !, 
   while the other is taking down personal content that does n't violate any international laws . 
  are n't they required by eu law to do so ? 
  the netherlands are like a small farmers ' village sometimes . 
  you can live here for all your life and some still do n't consider you to be dutch . 
  i ca n't speak for norway or spain , but etnic registration was abolished about 70 years ago in the netherlands . 
  why would i be proud of my own country , it was pure chance that i was born here . 
  [ no subs but i think you can understand some of it .

  not wanting gay teachers is a calvinist issue . 
  we 're talking about the netherlands here , people even blame the traffic jams on muslims . 
  $ 461.000 , - for a fence that violates the greek constitution . 
  i guess you need to make some sacrifices if you want a summer villa next to putin 's . 
  most of the complainers already visit that subreddit anyways . 
  ah , so that 's why the front page looks so nice today . 
  keep it up , mods !, 
  wups , time for our daily two minutes of hate . 
  i was n't talking to you . 
  i am not subscribed to european because i do n't want to discuss things with neonazis . 
  that 's also the reaaon why i do n't want them here . 
  there has been so much racism and support for far right violence lately , i can understand the mods want to keep people like you in one place . 
  why do n't you just keep your anti-brownimmigrant posts in european and coontown ? 
  problem solved . 
  you are surprisingly aware of your own na\u00efvity . 
  i think that people should be bannef of they support far-right attacks . 
  as long as i see support for far-right violence the moderation is lacking .
