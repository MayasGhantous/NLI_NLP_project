  you do n't even know anything about me . 
  why am i not surprised to hear this from a fellow dutchman ? 
  think of the children !, 
  pretty sick that they waste so much fuel just because some children do n't want to leave the earth without polluting enough . 
  edit : is n't it funny ? 
  if i had made a comment somewhere else opposing unnecessary flights i bet at least half the people would 've agreed . 
  put some ill children in it and everybody hates me . 
  like if it changes anything . 
  giving away state companies to some capitalists nearly for free is exactly what the liberals want . 
  yeah right , ` can not ' . 
  it 's more like `` do n't want '' . 
  i do n't know why you are being downvoted . 
  you are 100 % right . 
  the council of europe said that the liberals breeak international agreements but that the council if europe lacks the authority to force them to abide by it . 
  i think vvd+d ' 66 + cda is more likely ( remember , cda has an alot of seats in the senate ) . 
  but yeah , it will be horrible either way . 
  the dutch are just way too far to the right . 
  the right-wingers do n't care about all the corruption , the liberals just need to bully some blacks and they get all the votes . 
  but for the labour party to bend over and do whatever the liberals want , they should stop that immediately . 
  even if there is no alternative . 
  i have no words for this agreement . 
  the labour party should dissolve this government . 
  considering how similar their culture is to other eastern european countries such as belarus , estonia , tsjechia , and poland , i 'd say they definitely are european . 
  yeah , gmos are sciency and are therefore good . 
  anybody who disagrees is just fearmongering . 
  i would n't be too happy about it . 
  only west-chile will profit from it , as always . 
  how well do you speak dutch ? 
  how long have you been learning it ? 
  welp . 
  not visiting paris anytime soon ... 
  americans do n't pay taxes on a lot of online stuff , such as video games . 
  denemarken in dutch . 
  of course you can join !, 
  in fact , we already call it `` de benelux '' in dutch . 
  it 's the same in the netherlands . 
  most people here are only culturally athe\u00efst , and have n't done anything about it for years . 
  the greeks are robbed until they do n't even have clothes left . 
  and why ? 
  some bankers feel they do n't have enough money . 
  it 's sickening . 
  well , that doesn not sound very nice . 
  i have no idea what icily means , but it doesn not sound very nice . 
  can we trade one for [ mark rutte ] ( http://www.nrcnext.nl/blog/2012/01/04/mark-rutte-lacht-graag-heel-graag/ ) ? 
  why not ? 
  they can always close another hospital . 
  got ta defend ourselves against the russian danger . 
  no , it 's a very serious problem . 
  i fell victim to it last summer when i went to denmark to watch a public giraffe execution . 
  it was horrible . 
  have n't eaten ice since ... 
  the dutch government is at the verge of collapse over the issue with asylum seekers who will be sent back . 
  the labour party wants to give them a food and a place to stay until they leave , but the liberals want to let them roam the streets instead . 
  in the netherlands the monarchs are pretty much admired . 
  we even gave our now-queen a driver 's license and blamed the other guy when she caused an accident . 
  what does it matter ? 
  if we support it , we store american nuclear bombs , and if we oppose it , we store american nuclear bombs in secret . 
  if people keep reposting deleted threads , then what are they supposed to do ? 
  i quite like the rijn , though the donau is ok as well . 
  wow , thanks for the good advice , obama , i had n't looked at it that way . 
  longyearbyen is a pretty international . 
  because calvinists think , that to prevent a disease is to question god 's authority . 
  i can calculate it now if you 'd like . 
  it turns out to be a bit over a decade . 
  i think i made a mistake the last time i calculated it . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_uranium_reserves ) wiki page , there 's about 6.300.000 tonnes of uranium available for $ 260 per kg or less ( the current price is about half of that ) . 
  i ca n't find a total number of uranium , but let 's take 10.000.000 tonnes = 10 ^ 13 g . about 0,7 % of that is 235-u which can be used in our reactors . 
  the mass of one mole of 235-u is 235 g , so we have 0,007 \u00d7 10 ^ 13 / 235 moles of 235-u . 
  the constant of avogadro is about 6 \u00d7 10 ^ ( 23 ) , so that 's 0,007 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 10 ^ 36 / 235 atoms . 
  now , according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uranium-235 ) wiki page , a single 235-u atom produces about 3,24 \u00d7 10 ^ ( -11 ) j energy . 
  the efficiency of a nuclear reactor depends a bit on the type , but at 40 % we have 0,4 \u00d7 3,24 \u00d7 0,007 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 10 ^ 25 / 235 j. 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_energy_consumption ) wiki page , we need about 474 exajoules = 4,74 \u00d7 10 ^ 20 j in a year . 
  so if we 'd produce all our energy with nuclear reactors , we can continue about 0,4 \u00d7 3,24 \u00d7 0,007 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 10 ^ 5 / ( 4,74 \u00d7 235 ) years . 
  putting it all into a calculator gives 4,9 years . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_power_in_france ) wiki page , france produces 75 % of its electricity with nuclear power . 
  but of course i should not look at the electricity production , but at all energy production . 
  this is 39 % . 
  so if every country would produces 39 % of its energy with nuclear reactors , we 'd have enough unarium for only 4,9 / 0,39 = 12,5 years . 
  * nuclear energy is not a good idea . 
  it takes money that could better be spent at renewable energy , we 're stuck with the nuclear waste , and it 's not sustainable . 
  if every country would produce as much nuclear energy as france , we 'd be out of uranium within a decade . 
  * i think racism is bad , and stating so does n't derail meaningful discussions . 
  just closing your eyes for the far right does n't make them stop . 
  * i think it 's pretty sick that the danish murder healthy giraffes ` for children 's education ' . 
  * i think the parents should decide if their child is vaccinated . 
  we have freedom of religion , and if someone believes that vaccination is just another way to question god 's authority , the government is to respect that decision . 
  oh wow , i never realised the filthy putinbot scum said evil things like `` it 's time to see how it 's not your fairy tail about good vs evil '' and `` it 's good time to stop blindly support one side '' . 
  i hope the mods of / r/europe will help protect us against such horrible brigading . 
  aww , that 's so sweet of you . 
  maybe i can give you some soup recipes in exchange . 
  cook a courgette and some potatoes for about twenty minutes , add some salt , remove half the water , and mash it all together . 
  it 's a regional specialty . 
  is it too much speculation for you ? 
  surprising . 
  wow , good that kiev protects itself against this pro-russian scum . 
  maybe we should send them some more weapons , it 's the least we could do . 
  thanks rutte . 
  more germans are studying dutch than vice versa . 
  but i really like google so maybe the law should make an exception for them . 
  so the v and the f are pronounced the same in german ?
