  ( in liberal jargon : students will get their responsibility back . ), 
  another good thing is that our universities are pretty international . 
  i 've met students and professors from germany , denmark , sweden , england , belgium , france , spain , and even italy . 
  and they 're making an effort to make them even more international . 
  by making it more international they * obviously * do n't mean they will offer more language courses . 
  no , in fact , it means the exact opposite . 
  foreign students wo n't have to learn a second language anymore , and dutch speakers can abandon their first language altogether so we can all brabble in broken english . 
  regarding lower education , i think the system is pretty good . 
  we have good public schools all over the netherlands . 
  and if you do n't like a public school , you can always send your children to a catholic school if you do n't want them to learn about the pagan burnings from the spanish , to a protestant school if you do n't want them to learn about the martyrs of gorinchem , to a muslim school if you do n't want them to learn about the holocaust , or to a free school if you do n't want your children to learn anything . 
  one guy locked his bicycle through the front wheel . 
  a thieve decided it would be too much work to cut through the lock , so he just took off the bicycle frame from the front wheel . 
  then he took the front wheel of the bicycle next to it , and put the two together . 
  the frame he stole probably had a second lock , which he was able to open . 
  this exact same thing happened to me and my new bike two weeks after i moved to a bigger city . 
  edit : i now usually try to use at least two locks and tie my bicycle 's frame to a fence or something . 
  i just hope no-one needs my front wheel . 
  if you do n't know how to use your locks , [ this ] ( http://api.ning.com/files/ug-ogup9pz*l*42wksdpizrz*wi7kow53qxauiefdxmbfzpuls*pldx*pl140kjddsq4wtwf8aymwjq91zuar1zzjbmavyad/photo.jpg?width=425 ) will happen . 
  there are too few dutch actors . 
  it sucks seeing the same actors in every single dutch film . 
  ^ made my account to say this . 
  it 's very politicized in the netherlands . 
  on the right we have parties like the pvv ( freedom party - neonazi 's ) who want to shoot moroccan football holigans and want a dutch flag at every school ( to counter leftist indoctrination , of course ) ; and the vvd ( people 's party for freedom and democracy - liberals ) who want a special police department to target ethnic minorities and who want to deny immigrants * their first language . 
  and on the left we have people who are n't all that patriotic . 
  no-one knows why , maybe they hate themselves or something . 
  \\* immigrants are only poor , non-western immigrant of course , otherwise they 're called expats . 
  when they grew up here and speak dutch . 
   sick !, 
  european countries does n't even collect such statistics but i 'm pretty sure that number is 0 . 
  some dutch policeman shot a 17 year old a while back . 
  so it happens . 
  not very often though . 
  i 'm only 1,87 m , so i wished i were a bit taller . 
  not such a big deal though . 
   we do n't form genuine friendships , just superficial hi to all kinds of complete strangers hah , if you 've found a solution to this problem , you may pm me . 
  i 'd definitely go with the weather . 
  i wished the netherlands were as cool . 
  ah , that 's pretty interesting . 
  in the netherlands , we have fireworks just like in that youtube-video about denmark . 
  but every year , oculists and environmentalists make a case to only have organized shows and ban private fireworks . 
  do you think it works properly in france ? 
  do people complain about it a lot ? 
  when i first read the question , i thought it actually was a weekly . 
  i 'm not so sure about it . 
  on the one hand , i 'm not a right-wing authoritarian war-mongering nationalist , but on the other hand , i do n't like the republicans either . 
  liberals are usually blue , same for europe , but red is usually for the left-wing rather than for conservatives . 
  dutch food is so bad , even people who are tried for ethnic cleansing think it 's [ torture ] ( http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/war-crimes-suspects-%e2%80%9ctortured%e2%80%9d-dutch-prison-food ) . 
  the netherlands are pretty racist . 
  at the previous elections , about one in twelve people even voted for the racist party . 
  but it 's mostly directed aganst moroccan-dutch people - and sometimes other muslims , too - so you 'll probably encounter hardly any racism yourself . 
  we have a pretty high population density though . 
  i have no clue what you 're talking about , but i suggest asking on an internet forum . 
  i 'm not really an expert , so i do n't know what the best way is . 
  though , i 'd say that if you learn 60-80 common words every day , you already know 1800-2400 words after a month . 
  which is enough to get you started ( for example , the simple english wikipedia uses only the 1000 most common / basic words ) . 
  and in the beginning you 'll need to learn the new sounds you ca n't yet pronounce ( not that i ca n't pronounce the english th or a , but whatever ) , and later on when you know some words , you 're able to learn some more advanced grammar . 
  at least , that 's the method i 've always seen used in schools etc. 
  and the course my german housemate did also work like that . 
  i have to admit it was a german , so it 's a bit cheating , as some of the words are the same , and the grammar is nearly identical ( dutch is a bit easier to learn because there are no cases ) . 
  she did a really intensive course , learning dutch 8 hours a day and memorizing words in the evenings . 
  very exhausting and they had no time to do anything else , but after three weeks she spoke another language . 
  the mailman did n't even notice she comes from germany and thought she 'd just speak some dialect . 
  amazing . 
  :-) for english speakers , it 'll probably cost a bit more time . 
  but i think , if you were willing to spend your summer learning rather than relaxing , then you could still learn a new language in two or three months . 
  i 've seen people learn semi-fluent dutch in less than a month , so i would n't care too much about it . 
  meh , you just did n't meet the right europeans . 
  why do n't you try a couple of violent criminals ? 
  they love lethal weapons too . 
  that 's possible , too . 
  i figured they already drive over the large bridge between sweden and denmark so the afsluitdijk would be a bit too much of water . 
  though the afsluitdijk is not a bridge , which makes it special . 
  if you go to the afsluitdijk , i 'd cross the border it bit more to the north . 
  i 'm looking at google-maps now , and it seems like l\u00fcbeck ( the city that has been the most important hanze-city i mentioned earlier ) is just in the north-east of hamburg . 
  so i guess there are now three main routes through the netherlands i 'd suggest . 
  or to rotterdam -  ouddorp -  burgh-haamstede -  middelburg -  terneuzen ( netherlands ) -  gent ( belgium ) it all depends how much time you want to spend in the netherlands and where you want to go to in belgium . 
   instead , we would love to hear about your favorite roads to travel on . 
  not the belgian roads . 
  :d on a more serious note , you could cross the german-dutch border between meppen and meppel . 
  from there you can for example go to the village of [ giethoorn ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=giethoorn&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=qqw&amp;rls=org.mozilla:nl:official&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=qlfourq7d8ythgfppydybw&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=762&amp;dpr=1.25 ) ( quite nice in the summer ) . 
  you can then go further west , though i would avoid driving in the polder for too long , because it 's the flattest and most boring part of the world . 
  a better option is to go to the city of zwolle , an old [ hanze ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanseatic_league ) - city . 
  the hanze was a trade group in the 13th to the 15th century in northern europe . 
  i guess you can also see the city of l\u00fcbeck ( if i 'm not mistaken ) in the north of germany . 
  it has a nice star-shaped [ inner city ] ( https://maps.google.nl/maps?q=binnenstadzwolle&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;ei=l1nouuuwodgqhqfvvidyaw&amp;ved=0caoq_auoag ) . 
  you can still see the ` gracht ' ( moat ) , but most of the city wall does n't exist anymore . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=stadsmuur+zwolle&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=wfvouvx4jmmthqf9m4ag&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=762 ) you see a couple of meters of city wall , [ here ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=stadsmuur+zwolle&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=wfvouvx4jmmthqf9m4ag&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=762#q=sassenpoort+zwolle&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgdii=_ ) the ` sassenpoort ' ( poort = gate , it was build between 1406 and 1409 , and zwolle became a hanze-member during that time ) , and [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/peperbus.jpg ) you see the peperbus ( literally : pepper shaker ) . 
  from zwolle there are two ways south , one following the river ijssel ( the i and j are both capitalized in dutch ) to the city of deventer , and one more to the west to the city of amersfoort . 
  as for roads , we do n't really have much special , especially compared to swedish nature . 
  but i guess you can drive over a dike for a while . 
  there are plenty of dikes along the coast line but maybe along rivers , so it probably fits in your route . 
  in the netherlands , you can drive here with your aussi licence if you stay here temporarily . 
  if you are going to live here , you will need to get a dutch driving licence within half a year . 
  you can do this by either doing a dutch exam , or by marrying a crown prince . 
  depends a bit on the context . 
  in day to day life , it can refer to any immigrant . 
  but when a politician says ` immigrant ' , he means only the brown people [ irregardful wether or not they were born here ] . 
  nah , i do n't use plastic bags . 
  i guess that 's edible , but it tastes nowhere like when you do the same with boerenkool , andijvie , or wortelen . 
  i do n't know what it 's called in english ( or if it even has a name ) , but in the netherlands , people eat ` sour herb ' .
