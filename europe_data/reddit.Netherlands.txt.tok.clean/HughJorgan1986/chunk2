  https://twitter.com/euromaidan/status/439410888697589760/photo/1 but ukrainians ca n't really ca n't do shit about it . 
  and , to be honest , nato wo n't do shit about it either . 
  apart from expressing support : http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=5383 http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/infoservice/presse/meldungen/2014/140228-gem_erkl_ukr.html, 
  that 's already overdue . 
  they are now reporting that one of their border guards have been surrounded by russian commando units . 
  russian foreign ministry just issued a statement in which they say events in crimea are internal matters of crimea and , as such , they do n't see a need to talk to ukrainians . 
  regarding movements of armoured vehicles , russians say they are ensuring safety of the fleet . 
  what 's up with poland being so eager to adopt this and at the same time ordering time for possession of even trace amounts ? 
  young yanukovych 's assets , money trail goes to switzerland ( per usual ) and the netherlands . 
  i 'm 35 and i 've not seen it . 
  maybe i 'm not coming to the right sites . 
  yes . 
  it must be a new emoji coming from the japanese . 
  i have n't seen it ... 
  thanks,

  yes, 
  yes , shitlords from rt.com are already saying that southeast vows to restore constitutional order . 
  according to http://vk.com/wall-55297091_234484 ** yanukovych was found he was hiding in kharkiv ** . yanukovych night plane sat on the airport kharkov aircraft factory . 
  from there , the now former president went to the country one of the most influential local officials . 
  this is with reference to an unnamed source said , `` donetskie conduct . '', 
  according to sources , the board , `` unofficial '' prezydentskyy ** board flew to the united arab emirates , to divert attention . 
  yanukovych himself under the cover arrived in kharkiv to attend the congress ** . 
  initial plan called victor yanukovych at the congress proclamation of the new republic and the separation of the south-east of ukraine . 
  security guarantees for the new formation had become russian president vladimir putin , who had officially support the young state and enter a limited contingent to protect the country . 
  however , despite expectations , putin harshly refused even to recognize yanukovych , not to mention military support . 
  after this demarche project proponents refused to implement it by deciding on congress to support the integrity of ukraine . 
  yanukovych take part in it refused . 
  currently , the yanukovych seeks ways to escape from the ukraine . 
  the main obstacle remains the refusal of some countries to give him shelter .

  he 's already over iran , probably heading to dubai . 
  yanukovych is most likely escaping ukraine . 
  he 's on a private airbus a318 elite with rybak and a few other officials . 
  heading in the direction of tehran or dubai . 
  before leaving ukraine , he ordered that his most expensive belongings be packed and sent away from his mansion . 
  http://i.imgur.com/0zm13lj.png earlier report ( when it looked like he was just heading to kharkiv ) : http://zn.ua/politics/yanukovich-vyletel-v-harkov-139448_.html update : plane ( highlighted with arrow ) over the corridor to dubai ( traced by another plane , coming from dubai ) : http://i.imgur.com/f5nq7li.jpg some other sources ( unidentified high profile person from washington ) say he may already be in kharkiv . 
  what would russian news outlets say to this footage ?

  when it comes to consumption , your focus shifts with the amount of things you can buy . 
  granted , in a country like poland , the most people are preoccupied with is lodging and food , so this constitutes the majority of people 's expenses ( please check relevant gus data ) . 
  when it comes to clothes , they do n't get cheaper at all . 
  purchasing power parity does not apply , but it is not relevant as people 's focus is not on buying a new jacket each year . 
  as for choosing phones and laptops , it 's half marketing , half apple 's commitment to detail which brought its success . 
  still , they are the most expensive phones and there are simply very few people in poland who can obtain a phone for 5000 z\u0142 ( we 're not talking about old models ) , which are still very popular in more financially fortunate countries . 
  and whether apple purposely `` forgot '' poland , how many people you know owns a 9000 z\u0142 laptop ? 
  that 's why so few people have iphones for phones and macbooks as their laptops in poland and almost everyone and their dog have them in the uk . 
  but in the amount of potato we can buy with our wages , we are kings !, 
  plumbing is not required in america , we still need visas . 
  we 're the same eu , but slightly impaired . 
  mix water in bowl . 
  most expensive olympics in history , why should you expect them to be shabby ? 
  and all of these constitute a large portion of their respective countries population , so they actually grab the country conditions . 
  i 'm not trying to say anything else . 
  an iphone is surely cheaper in the village . 
  lyon , milan , geneva , munich , frankfurt , barcelona are not capitals . 
  i get they wanted to see the conditions where countries ' majority of people live .

  frankly , this looks worse than belarus . 
  seemingly , it 's not the first time . 
  i wish . 
  alas , the catholic church is a very serious player in poland , [ see ` gender ' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1uza0i/gender_is_the_new_enemy_of_the_polish_church/ ) , so it 's difficult not to take them seriously . 
  are n't they doing that already with netflix and youtube ? 
  this is also why so many poles emigrate . 
  if it was n't for your [ strange language ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvtdgsirsk8 ) , you 'd have them in throngs . 
  people do move out here . 
  they often move out and share rooms . 
  there are plenty of classifieds where people are advertising `` spots in two/three-person room '' . 
  this means there are two/three beds in a room . 
  this way they can afford living apart from their parents and still having money to buy food . 
  having a room to yourself is a better option , but i doubt many people will manage on the remaining 150 euros per month . 
  the most common entry wage is 300 $ after tax and e.g. 
  my rent ( 60 sq meters ) is 600 $ per month ( i ca n't complain ) .
