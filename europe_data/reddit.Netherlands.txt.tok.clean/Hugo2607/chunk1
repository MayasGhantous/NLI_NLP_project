it now says that the video has been removed by the user, 
  in 1815 ( the same year the netherlands became a monarchy ) the former `` spanish netherlands '' were added to the territory of the newly formed kingdom ( for reasons that are difficult to explain and not clear to me either ) . 
  the constitution was rewritten ( in both french and dutch ) and as a result and the belgians were given `` equal representation '' . 
  this all resulted in two things that did not sit well with the belgians : 1 . belgium barely had any national debt . 
  the netherlands had a very large national debt . 
  therefore the belgians were paying taxes in order to cover the dutch debt . 
  `` equal representation '' meant that belgians got 50 % of the seats in the states-general . 
  completely ignoring the fact that the belgian population at the time was bigger than the dutch population . 
  the belgians called this `` nederlands rekenen ( dutch calculation ) . '', 
  this lead to a civil war that the belgians won in 11 months , but the netherlands took 9 years to recognize belgium . 
  and then this guy did n't get it and did n't make a 19th century reference , 
  you guys are cool with covering most of our national debt , right ? 
  constantly threatening to leave the eu ? 
  but he 's also linking to evidence that russia supplied a buk to the separatists and does n't argue that someone other than the separatists shot it down . 
  that 's quite the opposite of the narrative on russian tv . 
   so says someone with russian flair are you seriously considering ** all ** russians biased ? 
  they 're not all a mouthpiece for their government you know . 
  also , it 's more than a bit ironic that you 're judging someone based on flair while you 've not even set yours . 
  yeah , that 's not how it works . 
  do n't worry , we were still the first country to legalize gay marriage . 
  does n't matter , as long as i still get the karma . 
  scotland does n't . 
  true , silly if you ask me , but true . 
  do you think this sets a precedent where sites could be blocked more easily . 
  even if you 're over 18 ? 
  then why do filters improve the isp 's image in england , but is it not considered necessary in other european countries ? 
  like i mentioned in another comment in this thread , opt-out isp-side internet filters are actually illegal here . 
  opt-in filters , instead of opt-out filters . 
  no , it 's part of our net neutrality law which was amended into the telecommunications law in 2011 after kpn ( one of the three major mobile isps ) was planning to charge extra if its customers wanted to use whatsapp , to make up for their lost revenue in texts . 
  this was so controversial that 6 months after kpn announced their plan ( widely dubbed the `` chat levy '' ) net neutrality was signed into law . 
  therefore it is now illegal for isps to : * block traffic ( and therefore websites ) * throttle traffic ( and therefore websites ) * enable web filters by default , isp side filters can be enabled but only if the customer explicitly requests them . 
  unless it 's necessary to keep the network available to others . 
  speed and data limits still apply of course . 
  ( though there are n't any data limits for fixed providers , applying them to fixed connections is legal . ), 
  websites can also be blocked nationwide if ordered by a judge . 
  this happened once , when the pirate bay was blocked . 
  the isps appealed and the site was unblocked one year later . 
   t 's their business they can do what they want no , they ca n't . 
  i ca n't speak for england , but here in the netherlands such an opt-out filter is actually illegal . 
  it 's censorhip . 
  the provider is adding sites to a list of `` inappropriate '' content , they are censoring . 
  of course it 's not like they 're censoring major news sites and sure you can turn it off in 5 minutes ( unless you 're over 18 ) , and most teenagers will know how to bypass it anyway . 
  but it 's still censorship . 
  strange , drowned by the sea would be more logical :p, 
  estonia stronk !, 
  estonia can into baltics !, 
  hey , the texts ca n't differ , eh ? 
  actually , you do , press and hold the button for the letter that needs an accent , a menu should pop up . 
   quest for mh370 continues after another disappointment :p they wrote another one , however google translate does n't really translate it all that well , so here 's a rough translation  ** chief executive of malaysian airlines receives help from his mother . 
  **  *** ` where did you last see the plane ? 
  ' ***  malaysian airlines executive ahmad jauhari bin yahya enlisted the help of his mother in the search for the missing flight mh370 . 
  he spoke of ` the last hope ' for the family and passengers : `` if she ca n't find the plane no one can . '', 
  mother aisyah binti osman appeared annoyed at the first press conference : `` men ca n't search at all , they look with their noses . 
  i asked ahmad where he last saw the plane . 
  he should start searching there . 
  but no , mister starts searching thousands of kilometers away . 
  pff , men . '', 
  ahmad however also keeps in mind a different scenario : `` she probably cleared the plane herself . 
  and if she finds it she 'll say ' i told you so ' . 
  but try to prove that . '', 
  somehow related : a google translated link to a dutch satirical news site mentioning the lost city of atlantis :p https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.speld.nl%2f2014%2f03%2f30%2fgevonden-brokstukken-zijn-delen-van-atlantis%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url, 
   5 . ancient greek fully prepared for time travel i see ? 
   willie wortel that 's gyro gearloose for the native english speakers , 
  je hebt je reactie niet in twee talen geschreven  you did n't write your comment in two languages , 
  he was actually playing along with the joke, 
  even if not written down i do n't think the eu would take kindly to any violation of its member 's borders . 
  is n't finland 's territorial sovereignty already guaranteed by the eu ? 
  well , you guys did paint this one building in moscow :p, 
  since joining the eu is purely voluntary this would mean that a lot of conflicts would have been resolved peacefully . 
  way to go eu , then xd, 
  why would you ? 
  ( also what country are you from ? ), 
  this is the exact reason why they might introduce such a ban in the netherlands . 
  probably only satellite internet . 
  so datacaps and high ping . 
   also , `` holland '' ? 
  i 'm raising my eyebrow as hard as i can right now . 
  plz do n't . 
  just let them call us holland and save everyone some trouble . 
  [ no they do n't . 
  wait , why would france even care ? 
  those charts do n't seem to account for streaming . 
  really ? 
  i thought german was 10x worse than french . 
  my local voting booth here in the netherlands also uses one of these , it 's pretty common actually . 
  not in the netherlands they wo n't . 
  that would violate our net neutrality law . 
  which is why we need a constitutional court . 
  no , but our house of representatives interprets the constitution , they could deem it unconstitutional . 
  ( we really should have a constitutional court though ), 
   but i like the icelandic one the best because it 's in a progressive order iceland is known for their progressiveness, 
  the current mayor of munich considers himself a `` fan of microsoft '' . 
  however switching back to windows would cost a lot of money , and there are n't any real issues with their linux systems , so a switch back to windows is highly unlikely . 
  this has already been discussed to death , right or wrong , the term gnu/linux or gnu plus linux simply is n't going to catch on . 
  the free software foundation and gnu project deserve recognition for starting the free software movement and making big contributions in the making of free software , but trying to change what people call the resulting system does n't help the movement at all . 
  people are going to keep calling it linux and in the long run it does n't really matter . 
  edit : i think i may have missed something obvious about the comment i was responding to ... 
  needs more [ vocaroo ] ( http://vocaroo.com/ ) . 
  i 've heard dutch being described as `` people speaking english in the other room , it sounds familiar but you just ca n't make it out '' by native english speakers , would you say that 's accurate ? 
  well , i do disagree with the law that makes it mandatory to have an id card with you in public at all times ( identificatieplicht ) .
