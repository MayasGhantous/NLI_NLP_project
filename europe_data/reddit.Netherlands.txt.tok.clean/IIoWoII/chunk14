  was n't a free election . 
  you applaud it based on your feelings about who the person is and not what is reported that she has done ... 
  the only things this article shows is that she used her democratic rights and she 's being negatively affected by doing so . 
  `` political correctness '' is the new `` cultural marxism '' . 
  just the usual bullshit by right-populist parties . 
  then you do n't know what that means . 
  this is reporting on sources , you can call the polls fake all you want but the news is n't . 
  stop saying fucking dollars you american idiot . 
  nationally , the us polls were actually correct . 
  the problem was people interpreting those polls wrongly and problems with a few key states . 
  sp though ... 
  meh , that sounds more like breitbart, 
  it 's not like it 's proven that you 're more likely to cause harm than disable the threat during an event or anything . 
  ( looking for the multiple sources ) weapons do n't prevent violence . 
  insecure ? 
  the fact that you feel any connection to the roman empire is fairly stupid . 
  * they 're . 
  your language is n't that hard ... 
  yea , the nazis sure were unifying . 
  wtf are you taking about you idiot ? 
  go back to the_dipshits, 
  those rule changes get calculated retroactively with the numbers ... 
  the options in the referendum were both effectively the same ... 
  those comments are removed and/or downvoted, 
  restaurants are owned by franchisees , and they pay their own taxes . 
  how do you know who to fine over jaywalking ? 
  merkel insists on peaceful resolutions , that 's why she 's a warmongerer !, 
  and then md5 will call for the same referendum, 
  eu has almost nothing to do with france 's current immigrant numbers . 
  afd ... 
  the problem is also that it 's effectively a regressive tax , since larger companies can and do use loopholes that smaller companies ca n't afford to use . 
  obama got 69 million in 2008 . 
  hillary got 60 million ... 
  so , how about that `` half '' . 
  or did you not read that graph from a few days ago correctly and thought the x-axis started at 0 ? 
  she is the most voted-for democratic candidate ever besides obama, 
  `` monthly disposable net worth increase '' then or something . 
  you do realize it 's `` a '' as in `` a / r/bestof '' , right ? 
  learn to differentiate editorials from regular articles ... 
  simple economics is the neoliberal conspiracy . 
  which is pure bullshit and completely disregarded in political theory . 
  the only place you find it is when people want to act smart . 
  ` le naive attack ' when you spout your nazi antisemetic nazi conspiracy bullshit . 
  not for me this time though . 
  because people do n't know what `` modern '' means and what they mean is `` contemporary '' . 
  1 dollar bills huh ... gulen is a stripper !, 
  needs more horrible photoshop . 
  steelseries headphones ? 
  interesting choice . 
  talking about north korean missile me thinks . 
  getting downvoted for asking for proof of something the guy later acknowledges is false ... 
  mics are peaking . 
  do n't know if these is a single feed or you can blame rt. 
  cato , nice source , no gun-hardon at all . 
  the comments here also have a nice display of saviour complex . 
  [ guns do n't make you safer ] ( https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/scientists-agree-guns-dont-make-society-safer/ ) . 
  even in ` allah hu akbar ' situations , as is being referred to ... 
  your ass is not going to help shit . 
  inb4 ` le lefty scientists ' . 
  we did this series like a couple months ago already . 
  i 'm not ever going to bungee jump . 
  not because it 's scary ( it prob is but that 's the point ) but because most of these venues look shady as fuck . 
  i hope the business owner . 
  then akgnz 's point is mute . 
  yea ... an american one . 
  they do n't care about being logically consistent . 
  i 'm fairly pro-eu but i 'm going to correct you ... 
  it was known that greece was lying . 
  just like italy , but because italy was allowed to join anyway , greece was too . 
  i do notice that i say `` boterram '' actually yea . . 
  i think the `` spin '' is a more direct reference of ` spinnen ' , making yarn from fibers . 
  the noun for something made in that process could be called a ` spinsel ' . 
  but the animal ` spin ' is of course also named after the making of the yarn ... 
  so i would be interested to know what is derived from what . 
  oh and the textile ` spin ' is of course derived from the fact that you spin a wheel to do it ... 
  but we do n't really use that definition in dutch ... 
  probably many components for all kinds of things . 
  like you said , chips , but broader . 
  do n't they have factories here ? 
  remove your local tax . 
  20 % of 400 is 80 . 
  so compare 320 euros to 400 usd ... 
  the vat issue is actually quite easier than he makes it . 
  if the money you get from a country is lower than https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/resources/documents/taxation/vat/traders/vat_community/vat_in_ec_annexi.pdf than you just charge the vat where you are in . 
  otherwise the other way around . 
  also , free movement is a part of the common market and ca n't be seperated , as stated by many officials . 
  fuck off , there are like 3 people like that . 
  but they have n't ... 
  tagging galore in this thread . 
  guys , this means they are the opposite of homos !, 
  just eurogay propaganda . 
  the banks for helping the greek gov. 
   did n't france used to have a ` french only ' policy for military stuff ? 
  pretty sure that 's illegal now . 
  even switzerland had to be forced to let non-swiss companies bid on military-knife contracts . 
  the idea that you ever had the internet was a techno-utopist acid trip anyway . 
  switch jobs ? 
  best way to get a raise ... 
  must be the chemicals in the water . 
  you know what the uk should do ?
