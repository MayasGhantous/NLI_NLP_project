  yes . 
  you do n't know about alf ( animal liberation front ) ... ? 
  fbi qualifies it as a terrorist organisation . 
  sad that every eu youtube-video attracts so many anti-eu people ... sigh . 
  not fucking you again , go away . 
  wtf is this bullshit . 
  edit : also , '' amerikkka amirite !? 
  ron paul 2012 and alternet ftw , do n't forget trusty old russia-today ! '', 
  '' who do i call when i want to talk to europe '' - henry kissinger, 
  hopefully a majority by number of people , instead of states . 
  lol '' noisy tourists go home ! '', 
  reminds me of `` waito piggu go homu '' in japan . 
  it 's not , it just has to be approved by a doctor and done in special conditions etc , ifaik . 
  you ca n't overdose someone else . 
  no problem . 
  hmm ... 
  anyway , i highly doubt it also because the pvda ( labour ) is generally euro-friendly and is getting a lot of votes instead of the sp ( socialist ) which is more eurosceptic . 
  probably low ; they already signed the treaty ... why would they block it ? 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/croatia-eu_accession_treaty_signature_page_5.png pvv is also probably going to get less votes . 
  huge wall of text , gon na leave that for tomorow to read . 
  breaking news : stop reading alternet . 
  who cares about the law when you have a tank ? 
  who says you ca n't buy a tank ? 
  just post it to worldnews or something . 
  by your reasoning i could post anything here . 
  oooooowk . 
  i think he was being sarcastic ... 
  i really hope so , anyway . 
  i disagree with my results , jill stein seems extremist `` nationalize all big banks '' on some things . 
  i 'm more like obama ( although the campaign-obama seems a bit much to the left sometimes . ), 
  so ... you want to get * spend * nuclear fuel out of a thermal reactor and put it in your own reactor ... ? 
  there 's a reason why they got the spend fuel out of there . 
  everything , it 's the doom-and-gloom anti-eu anti-us anti-anything-western channel . 
  it 's supposedly russia-today but they never talk about russia critically ... hmmm ... why would that be . 
  stop fucking linking fucking rt you scum !, 
  strange . 
  yea , they pasted some other things on their program to look like they are n't . 
  d66 is kinda centre-right progressive . 
  vvd * should * be in favor of withdrawing of the wietpas because they 're a liberal party ( original liberal meaning , not the new american `` liberal '' ) , but i do n't know what their actual stance on it is . 
  every one on the left is in favor of withdrawing it . 
  because , people should n't vote for a one-issue party . 
  yes , you do . 
  you get treated the same in the uk as a uk citizen applying . 
  young people are stupid and `` rebelious '' . 
  will always be . 
  so ... awesome . 
  seeing earth like that almost got me teary eyed . 
  most people here are probably leftist about that issue , mostly because you do n't see many opposing arguments here and thus becomes a circlejerk . 
  i am centrist on it though . 
  that sounds so fucking terrible . 
  damn internet hippies . 
  i like the taste better , other in my family generally do n't care and drink fresh . 
  you do n't have to be either of the extremes ... you can be somewhere in the middle . 
  also , people have to stop equating the financial industry with capitalism ... like it 's the same . 
  i would regard myself as capitalist ( if that 's even a thing ) but i want more banking regulation ( not that that 's really relevant for the netherlands anyway . 
  but i guess it 's fashionable now to call yourself anti-capitalist with even knowing what it really means . 
  jesus was middle eastern . 
  how unbiased and neutral . 
   it blames market regulation and rules  they say capitalism in eu failed yea ... market regulation and rules is pretty much the opposite of capitalism . 
  i wish i lived in the beautiful country of oink . 
  well fuck that . 
  qatar is insane . 
  and potatoes , potatoes hate the irish . 
  you should do example cases , that 's idiotic and against the idea of justice . 
  omg , the ** evil ** corporations again !, 
  woohoo , i can understand some sentences !, 
  not yet , please . 
  well , there 's the northern and the southern g. northern is harsh coming from your throat , like sambri said `` if someone knows spanish , it 's like `` je '' ( like in jam\u00f3n ) '' . 
  the southern g is soft ... like uhm sort of an sh sound coming from the back of your ` palate ' ( roof of your mouth . ), 
  hard g : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_glottal_fricative / http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiced_glottal_fricative soft g : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_palatal_fricative / http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiced_palatal_fricative, 
  but they have futurama in saudi arabia . 
  good that i unsubscribed from / r/business , it rarely is about business . 
   it 's been proven to not work . 
  where ? 
  no , please , no . 
  it will be full of loaded question from extremists of both sides that frequent / r/europe . 
  pretty sure i heard this a couple weeks ago . 
  also funny how they think the average wage is norway is twice as high as in germany . 
  germany does n't have minimum wage . 
  you might wan na try australia , they have quite a demand for construction workers . 
  you ... got married at 20 ? 
  damn ... 
  i do n't even want to think about marriage for a long while . 
  i do n't like the youth 's obsession with binge drinking . 
  seems to be every but in your country it seems to be way more common . 
  overal , it 's ok ... might be going there in the next couple of years to live . 
  guess they wo n't be the only gay in the village . 
  i 'd like common tax . 
  some people think here that money leaving your country is good , haha . 
  `` good riddance '' , sure lol . 
  why not tax it at 100 % , eh ? 
  that will surely keep 'm here . 
  ow wait , you guys do n't care about that ... why not tax everyone at 100 % ? 
  and have the government distribute the needs of people for free ? 
  there was clearly european elitism with the higgs boson discovery . 
  do n't act like a douchebag . 
  most men would sleep their way to nothing . 
  i heard of people eating at 17.30 . 
  that 's crazy early for me . 
  wel , pvv is the only party that does n't have to show their finances because they 're a one man party .
