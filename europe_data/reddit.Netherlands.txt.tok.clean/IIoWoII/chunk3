  just wait till 2015 then . 
   frothiness, 
  uhm ... headscarfs are banned in turkey because it 's seen as radicalism . 
  atat\u00fcrk saw headscarves as backward-looking and an obstacle to his campaign to secularize and modernize the new turkish republic . 
  the issue of the headscarf debate has been very intense and controversial since it was banned . 
  [ 1 ] turkey is a secular country and over 95 % of its people are muslims . 
  [ 2 ] it has resulted in a clash between those favouring the secular principles of the state , such as the turkish army , [ 3 ] and those who are more conservative with their religious beliefs . 
  except it 's not fucking 50 , 50 . 
  stop saying that , it 's just not true .

  pffffffff uhm ... ... ... :\\ ... ... 
  being a baltic state ? 
  i thought this was , what do you know about ? 
  putin : `` eu is literally nazi germany '' . 
  bit extreme ...

  how generous . 
  secretary , not minister . 
  because animals / objects ca n't consent to anything . 
  retard . 
  f-secure is obviously totally unbiased . 
  private debt is not relevant . 
  population problems are overstated, 
  disagree with the `` no freedom of expression `` because honestly , its not that bad ... 
  but agree with the other things . 
  please stop spreading this extreme unproven idea on reddit , kthx . 
  reported for misleading ? 
  this is nothing new , uk already has / had laws like this . 
  and that is relevant because ... ... ... ... ... 
  it 's not really true . 
  permanent visa is not citizenship . 
  learn the meaning of socialist if you think france is socialist, 
  is that supposed to be cheap ? 
  i can get atleast 2 here for that price . 
  stop circlejerking iceland, 
  ca n't you vote at an embassy or consulate or something ? 
  that joke must become old . 
  `` atheist laws '' ? 
  are you aware that that 's totally irrelevant ? 
  because the adopters need to be background-checked . 
  born out of wedlock does n't even mean that you 're not the child of someone anyway ... 
  and that 's relevant because ... . . ? 
  poisoning from radioactive substances ! = radiation poisoning . 
  and that 's relevant because ... . . ? 
  i remember when they poisoned our wells . 
  qmv is going in in 2014 so the area that 's veto-able is getting way less already /, 
  it 's still reduced price compared to full price ( something like 20k , which us students pay ) . 
  you 're wrong . 
  it 's so that say canadian companies can sue eu governments ( or the eu itself ) if the eu does n't comply with things in treaties . 
   so , is there any countries in the eu that would allow me to study for a reduced price every eu country . 
  do n't you mean ... the presinator ? 
  the arctic sunrise actions were pretty much retarded though . 
  i , for one , do n't care if they stay in prison . 
  or eu citizenship , which gives all voting rights if you 're a resident .

  fucking populists everywhere . 
  and the rational centrists have no idea how to make themselves appeal to the public . 
  in other news : why does n't anyone have any presidential candidates yet ? 
  it 's not hard to fight such aggresive strategies as a company : buy the solar panels from china and resell them here in europe . 
  they might even decrease the price even more , which gives you an even bigger profit . 
  classic way to fight these tactics . 
  free trade is atleast fucking giving them a pay rise of atleast 10 % each fucking year in china . 
  stop fucking taking `` low wages '' as an example of corporate `` exploitation '' when the wages are increasing every year as a consequence of that `` exploitation '' . 
  having lived in japan , they seriously have some lack of computer knowledge . 
  fax machines every-fucking-where , the school computers were running windows millenium ( or 2000 ) when i was there in 2009-10 . 
  the computers people used at home were like atleast 7 years old and running ie5 as the browser . 
  japan has a high degree of  failed ict or no computer experience so typical . 
  bet mouth cancer 's higher .

  still , instead of economies naturally recovering , reddit wants to artificially inflate economies by government spending . 
  vodka = russian , wodka = polish . 
  lol , `` vodka '' when talking about poland . 
  i remember everybody liking it in elementary , but i hated it . 
  s ^ o ^ b ^ r ^ a ^ v ^ e,

  although i also thought he meant the opposite . 
  there were never forests here , all forests here are fake anyway . 
   their royal family are the house of orange , and so there 's an affiinity with that colour misconception . 
  the association of the colour orange with the house of orange-nassau comes from the house of nassau , which has the colours of orange & blue , the house of orange has the colours of yellow & blue . 
  swiss sounds like finnish-german to me . 
  it 's not done by nationality but by residence . 
  what 's italian reddit 's opinion of centrist parties ? 
  warmongering dictators ? 
  sure ... sounds good . 
  in the end : united kingdom of london ... and northern ireland .

  the slightest movement of the hand translates to meters at that distance .
