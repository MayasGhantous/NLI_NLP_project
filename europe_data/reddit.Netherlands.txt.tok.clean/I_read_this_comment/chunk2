  i think its way better to focus on the small things that can have a large impact on society . 
  stop the foreigners with very questionable goals that fund moqsues in netherlands and decrease the influence of extremely reactionary imams on our community . 
  you can also simply increase the number of policemen doing counter-terrorism . 
  thins like this allready happen . 
  censoring just differs per country . 
  convicts in netherlands are named with full first name and only the first initial of their surname while many other other countries do the opposite , first name is a initial and show the full surname . 
  you also got the same thing on censoring faces . 
  faces in germany and netherlands are more often censored if the person disagrees with it being shown . 
  even if they had commited a misdemeanor or are arrasted for a crime . 
  if you care you can find it out but a big part of the population just doesnt care enough to do that . 
  depends on the source of course . 
  but in college i had a very good source in my ergonomics book . 
  the book used several studies from the university of delft . 
  it had average heights of female/male and age groups and all specific body parts too ( width of the bottocks , length of forearm , eyesight height that kind of things ) . 
  and those studies werent selfreported but done by professors and their students . 
  it also has a site ( with a bad interface ironically enough ) : http://dined.io.tudelft.nl/en, 
  technically you 're a heretic then . 
  heathen are people who dont believe in the same god . 
  heretics follow a different religion of the same god . 
  nutrition too , no famine since 1815 . 
  except the last two years in wwii . 
  cant you just do that by nationally funding your own cooperatives more alongside the eu funding ? 
  why not both if your marketprices are a problem and feel a need to boost local production . 
  though personally i would vouch for investments and funds on high end farmer products while importing the cheaper products . 
  i think your should be honour bound to making rational decisions . 
  using the future prognoses of exting eu ( get a bad trade deal like norway or completely leaving and only having new trade deals being developed in the next 5 or 10 years and have a big recession until then ) and spin the advisory election results into we must change eu from within into something we like it to be . 
  and take the reasons why people voted brexit ( immigration and more democracy and transparency in the eu and the important eu commisioner positions . ), 
  all the way and defend them as vocally as possible . 
  if you do the above you are still representing the people as a politician . 
  which is the essential part of indirect democracy . 
  depends on the age but pretty much any bicycle build in the past 15 years is build with an aluminium frame . 
  specifically the 6061 t6 alloy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6061_aluminium_alloy, 
  the way that food regulation is written sticks the rules and guidelines down the throat of companies , not on consumers . 
  that is a huge difference . 
  its fair to ask for a balance because companies need the room to be competitive and the room to deliver the highest quality product too . 
  and its fair to question about how to inform people concerning food products but that is in a whole different context than what your argument is about . 
  more of a hindsight is 20/20 question . 
  but is it possible to renegotiate one or two parts of the eu membership for a country ? 
  the two painfull points for great britian seems to be freedom of movement for eu members and contributions to eu . 
  would it have been possible for great britian to explore and negotiate alternative options while still maintaining the eu membership ? 
  ( to me this seems to be the most stable choice for a country to make ) or is a soft / hard brexit the only way ? 
  nuclear power comes from 1 power plant and it provides 4 % of the total energy . 
  it takes 10-20 years of construction before you can build a new power plant . 
  i 'm a bit nihilistic but being in favour or agianst nuclear energy matters very little on the whole in my country . 
  it would n't happen that the only power plant is closed in the near future either , simply because it hasnt been a important point for years and the focus is about how much gas we are pumping in the north and about opening new or closing coal power plants . 
  assuming the voting base doesnt change that much they are close to garantueed to get more experience on governing the big student cities ( cities like amsterdam , utrecht , delft , groningen and wageningen ) in the next year provincial elections . 
  thing is you need to form a coaliton between parties to rule the government . 
  that means compromising and working together for a mayority , so an extreme party cant rule unless they compromise severly . 
  every dutch government has been a centralist , centre right or centre left coalition since mid 19th century . 
  neo liberal policies , which includes doing austerity during depressions , is supported up to an extent by centre and centre-right parties . 
  mostly vvd , cda , d66 and sgp . 
  a different and older school of thought namely keynes is more supported by centre left . 
  keynesian policies means doing a bit of austerity and reforms but having the focal point on increasing investments and kickstarting the economy by pumping money into it . 
  and then in good times trying to reduce the debt you made . 
  i would argue that pvda support of too much austerity policies was its downfall . 
  austerity during depression is pretty heartless in the eyes of centre and centre left voters . 
  because you 're not there for the people who need a bit of support from the government . 
  nor are you throwing bones or offer a good vision on the future when you dont invest enough besides austerity . 
  greenleft isnt really far on the left in terms of how socialistic they are . 
  its economic policies besides the new drastic tax-changes on emissions , cars and meat are closer to social-democrats than that of the socialists . 
  they dont want to nationalize things , they want better distribution of wealth similar as the pvda . 
  and they arent conservative / stubborn on healthcare , pension age or education as sp but share more their views with social liberals on those areas . 
  i think its stupid to view them as socialists , to me they are progressive greens on the centre left . 
  is this about the first round of elections or second round for presidency ? 
  they made a wrong move , they should stay longer in the eu until the dutch shared their land reclamation and polder techniques . 
  only then the uk could move towards the centre of the altantic and get out the eu geographically too . 
  foreign rule of the lower countries didnt really start agian since karl the great until philip the good of burgundy . 
  philip aimed to become king and he gained a huge amount of territorries in the 15th century . 
  in 1400 only parts of wallonia were ruled by burgundy and in 1477 , just before philip died , philip ruled over whole belgium and netherlands except friesland and the bishopric of liege . 
  besides burgundy only france ruled over flanders and antwerp until the 1300 's . 
  karl the great is not seen as one of us . 
  he is seen as a forefather of the holy roman empire and one of the most important figures for western europe . 
  just like napoleons brother ( who ruled over us during the napoleonic wars ) karl is seen as a foreigner who loved us and improved us . 
  utrecht specifically got a lot of funds and visits from karl . 
  mainly because it was a bishopric and they played an important role in christianizing the north . 
  its two opposing economic philosophies that collide , especially in some countries that had to do lots of austerity measures . 
  the opposing philosophy of austerity measures during recessions is increasing spending and setting up investment plans to boost the economy . 
  usa back in 2009 when obama made an investplan to boost the economy is a very good example of the opposing philisophy . 
  to complete both philisophies : austerity measures in bad times is combined with investing in positive times and you combine investment plans and increased spending in bad times with austerity measures and decreased spending in positive times . 
  i want to understate that ** both philosophies work ** as long as you stick to it for a very long time . 
  i personally support investment plans and increased spending in bad times , because thats the moment people need support ( you feel goddamn afwul without a job or if you got no prospects on getting a better job ) . 
  and there are lots of other valid reasons and protests to say austerity increased the burden on the citizens . 
  however when austerity is done correctly it should also fix the recession quicker . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** those countries and people are mad cause the eu enforced too much austerity on their countries and they would 've prefered more investment plans . 
  then you would see it in the data thats gathered , but you cant really see effects of cultural and religious differences as big as wealth and health have when you look at birthrates in countries over a period of time . 
  on [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/countriesbyfertilityrate.svg ) you can see that iran , thailand , south korea and tunisia are on a western average . 
  while they are buddhist , confucian , shia and sunni . 
  meanwhile all countries that have industrialised so far went from 6-8 children pre-industralisation per parent to 1.5-2 .5 children after industrializing . 
  its totally fair to think that a diference of having around 1 child more between two groups is signifcant but a difference of 3-6 children should then be considered as far more significant . 
  there are also some really weird differences that are hard to explain with only culture , religion and wealth alone . 
  france has a birthrate of 2.1 while portugal has 1.2 , but the ( lack of ) differences between their cultures , religion and economy would not explain that big gap . 
  i 'm talking about the big picture not minor groups and you should adjust your policies to handle these differences in a reasonable way . 
  you should know that your examples are about very few minorities . 
  to combat your point i would change child support to decrease per every child a family has in order to promote having only a few children per family and to relieve the burden on the rest of society from big families . 
  having more wealth makes people breed less and immigrants adopt the fertility rate of the new country after 1-2 generations . 
  even 3rd country `` hellholes '' adapt quickly thanks to their increase in wealth . 
  bangladesh went from 5-6 childern to 2.2 children per parents in less than two decades . 
  thinking others with outbreed the west and that religion and culture are the biggest impact on how many children they get is a very outdated view . 
  lack of wealth and high chance of death for children makes people breed not their culture/religion . 
  it even prognosed that world population is going to stagnate before we reach 12 billion , which is a lot and a big problem but manageable and not a `` the end of the world '' problem .
