i truly doubt europe/nato would stand idle were russia to occupy sweden/finland . 
  although ( a part of ) ukraine aspires ( or perhaps , aspired ) to be a member state of the european union , they are n't currently and the invasion of ukraine is , although morally disgusting , not a breach into european territories . 
  true , but that does n't withstand the fact that it worked pretty well . 
  the idea of going to war to russia is n't something i would be looking forward to either . 
  what / r/parabellum8g said ; to give a fine example of the internal divide , belgium went for 541 days without a government , as they could n't agree on how it should be formed . 
  they currently hold the unenviable world record for this . 
  they have three national languages , french , dutch and german , although the influence of the latter is negligible . 
  there 's a federal and regional governments , but besides that , there are ` community governments ' based on the language of the citizens . 
  the regional and community governments tend to conflict with each other . 
  internal power struggles , a heavily polarized populations . 
  not really a safe bet for the future . 
  that seems like a safe assumption . 
  if one of the european member states prefers to be ruled by force rather than the rule of law , i gladly see these member states rolling over to the side of russia . 
  europe is n't perfect ; it lacks transparency and the european countries may be culturally diversified , but from my point of view , russia is only making europe better and stronger by creating a common enemy . 
  actually , if we look at history , was n't germany forged together with wars ( 1871 ) ? 
  we 're going to need a cross-post to / r/nottheonion here . 
  it works multiple ways . 
  why are n't we seeing for example a capital levy of 5-10 % on personal net worth exceeding a certain amount ( say $ 200,000 ) ? 
  high net worth individuals are the people who have seen their wealth increase as a result of the growth of the previous decade ( s ) . 
  why is n't europe looking at financial repression , thus shifting part of the unsustainable debt burden to captive audiences such as banks and other long-term debt holders ? 
  why are n't we seeing the successful [ ` icelandic model ' ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/09/business/dealbook/iceland-to-lift-capital-controls-imposed-after-financial-crisis.html ) not brought into practice in greece ? 
  -- most likely because having a single currency in the eurozone does not allow such a construction . 
  mark blyth wrote a wonderful book ( [ `` austerity : the history of a dangerous idea '' ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22104268-austerity ) ) on this subject , and also a [ youtube video ( 5.34 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go2bvgi0ree ) if reading an entire book is a bit too much for today . 
  back on its feet by what measure ? 
  unemployment is still at [ 22.4 % ] ( http://www.newstalk.com/spain-is-starting-to-get-back-on-track--but-the-eurozones-recovery-has-slowed ) . 
  and to quote [ the article ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21660550-growth-has-returned-dangers-still-lurk-back-its-feet#uhh4dy3tl3kqpktw.99 ) bears the headline ` spain 's economy back on its feet ' : `` yet so deep was the downturn that spain is still far from regaining all the ground it lost . 
  moreover , it is not clear how much the recovery has to do with spain 's vaunted policy shifts . '' i strongly advise you to read the entire article as it is not so overwhelmingly pro-austerity , nor does it attribute much of the recovery to the measures imposed by the trojka . 
  i do not feel any sympathy for greece 's current representatives , and there 's enough to be said about greece -- what developed country does not a properly functioning tax collection system in place ? 
  however , the measures imposed by the trojka are passing the bill to the greek tax payers , and eventually the european tax payers as greece 's debt is unsustainable . 
  if we look for example at iceland , we see a different picture . 
  the government allowed the banks to go bankrupt and imposed capital controls . 
  its economy nor it citizens did not suffer like the people in greece did - iceland 's investors and bondholders did . 
  but are n't they exactly the people who should bear the risk when it goes down south ? 
  not implying the situation in greece and iceland is fully comparable , though . 
   fresh evidence of the dramatic impact of the greek debt crisis on the health of the country 's finances has emerged , with official figures showing tax revenues collapsing . 
  or perhaps : '' fresh evidence of the dramatic impact of the trojka 's austerity measures on the health of the country 's finances has emerged , with official figures showing tax revenues collapsing . '', 
   google is only dominant because it 's better than all the competition . 
  was internet explorer the dominant browser because of its superiority in comparison to other browsers ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  internet explorer was a wreck which held back competition in the market for years . 
  microsoft effectively eliminated competition by bundling internet explorer with its dominant operating system , window . 
  you could argue that if other browsers were better , then consumers would 've switched to such browsers . 
  if consumers were indeed rational and all-knowing , the market would most likely sort itself out . 
  my grandmother or parents however , do not install a new browser . 
  why go through all ` the hassle ' , when ie ` just works ' ? 
  not to mention that they probably even do n't know that there are alternatives out there . 
  when the european commission forced microsoft to implement the ballot box , the screen which allows you to select a new browser , the market shifted . 
  chrome , safari , and firefox all increased their market share . 
  simply because they were superior to microsoft 's - then - outdated internet explorer . 
  ever since 2009 , or better : the ballot box , browsers have improved greatly . 
  not just chrome or firefox , but internet explorer as well . 
  on my surface , i even use edge alongside chrome because it feels so smooth . 
  back to google . 
  google products are awesome - i most certainly agree on that . 
  we do n't however know what the market would look like if competitors actually stood a chance . 
  why use any alternative if google shoves down your throat any of its services via its dominant search engine ? 
  the market does n't settle itself simply because of the fact that google 's products ` just work ' . 
  we do n't know what the alternative would look like if there was an actual level playing field between competitors . 
  perhaps , if you manage to find our president . . 
  austerity !, 
  we 'll replace gold with silver , or even bronze , if that may be required !, 
  i was n't aware that iceland was ( still ) under capital controls . 
  came upon [ ** this article ** ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/06/iceland-bins-capital-controls ) in the economist . 
  interestingly enough :  unsurprisingly , in his latest announcement mr benediktsson was gushing in his praise for the government , and the icelandic people , for having righted their economy so fast . 
  ** many economists point to iceland as a case study of what should be done during an economic crisis : devalue your currency , impose capital controls and avoid excessive austerity . 
  ** but whether this strong performance will last is not clear . 
  household debt is still high , and the imf worries about the effect of removing capital controls too fast . 
  some people also fret about a house-price bubble . 
  iceland is not out of the woods yet . 
  hurts to read this when we look at the greek situation . . 
  or morbidly muscular . 
  why bmi ? 
  the body mass index is not a great metric to measure ones health . 
  if you workout , are 1.90 m tall , weigh 100kg , while having 14 % bodyfat , you 're perfectly healthy . 
  your bmi will however be 27.7 and you 'll be considered * overweight * . 
  sorry , i was n't being clear , and i think you therefore misunderstood me . 
  i do n't hold any grudges against people who are more wealthy than i am . 
  rich ( er ) people have just as much right to complain as any ` ordinary ' citizen . 
  what i was implying , is that the middle class ( and up ) * in general * tend to find their way through the legal system more easily and tend to be more assertive in claiming their rights . 
  litigation in general is more accessible to these citizens . 
  i do n't lack empathy for the situation these people are in . 
  living next to a building site for years would drive me * nuts * . 
  i however am somewhat sceptical towards their ability to actually do something about it . 
  to put this into perspective . 
  if you were to live in a small rental room , while living on near minimum wage , and your neighbours cause nuisance , you would be more reluctant to litigate , as the costs of doing so are quite a hurdle ( if not unaffordable ) . 
  on the other hand , if you live in a multi-million neighbourhood , a lawyer might be quite eager to pick up your case on a no-cure no-pay basis , as he will earn some of the damages ( which will be significantly higher in the multi-million neighbourhood vs. the small rental room where the minima lives ) . 
  i know my posts contains a lot generalizations , but i hope you get the gist of it . 
  i just wonder , half of the documentary is about citizens complaining about their neighbours building these multi-level mega-basements . 
  these citizens have to stand the noise of the excavations for multiple years . 
  why do n't they take up civil litigation in order to get compensated for the nuisances/disruptions ? 
  the prospected owner of the basement get their fancy multi-level basement , while the neighbours get monetary compensation . 
  i do n't really see the problem here . . like the top youtube comment states ; this documentary is mostly about rich people complain about richer people . 
  did not any of them decide it was a good idea to consult a lawyer , or does english tort law prohibit such claims ? 
  i would assume this would depend on the state in particular . 
  in the netherlands , decentralized governmental organizations are assumed to be autonomous . 
  public agencies having reserve cash seems normal in this scenario . 
  on the other hand , france has a more centralized state form , i would ** assume ** that deconcentrated organizations of the state might not have as much discretion in keeping reserve cash . 
  the france part is merely an assumption though . 
   we can keep that going man , east vs west . 
  just like those germans themselves did a few decades ago !,
