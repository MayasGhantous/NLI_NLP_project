   i think the biggest problem with the austerity policies that were imposed is how they diminished the impetus for genuine structural reform . 
  it seems to tear down the fragile social fabric in the european union too . 
  we actually do need social cohesion within the european union if we want to stand as an united europe . 
  i do n't think the austerity measures - although perhaps necessary - contribute well to that goal . 
  is n't this sold commonly at weihnachtsmarkten either ? 
  i recall having one of these in berlin last winter , they were delicious !, 
  especially since * only * 20.7 % of the population from the netherlands is from a multicultural background . 
  that video ended abruptly . 
  it looks amazing though . 
  i saw several documentaries on this sarcophagus , but none of them mentioned its capabilities to dismantle the facility . 
  the chernobyl disaster is tragic , but it is also a beautiful piece of human history . 
  i still look forward to visiting the site some day in my life . 
  it 's a company with dutch origins !, 
  interestingly , they 're all around the world . 
  i was rather surprised when i saw a randstad-establishment in essen , germany . 
  at least , i think it was in essen !, 
  would n't a constitutional court be a better idea ? 
  the legislative procedure would become shorter , allowing parliament to respond more quickly to the needs of society , while a truly independent court would be granted the authority to declare the very same legislation unconstitutional - very much like the german * bundesverfassungsgericht * or the united states * supreme court * . 
  if i only look in my own country , the netherlands , there can be made a case against a collective minimum wage . 
  living in the ` randstad ' , which is practically the only part of the netherlands which most foreigners will ever see ( amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague , and utrecht ) is more expensive than other parts of the country . 
  i would n't feel comfortable living on a minimum wage in the randstad , but in the cheaper areas it 's quite a different story . 
  living on the dutch minimum in krakow , poland , would be rather awesome though . 
  why would n't , for example , a progressive tax system benefit less developed countries ? 
  background information : the provinces directly elect our senate ( ` eerste kamer ' ) . 
  formally , the eerste kamer operated as co-legislator . 
  historically , it only judges the [ lawfulness , practicability , and enforcability ] ( http://www.eerstekamer.nl/id/vil7lkxkqjw1/document_extern/101214_staatsrechtelijke_positie/f=/vil7lm95a5zw.pdf ) ( * dutch source * ) of proposed legislation . 
  however , our constitution does not prevent the eerste kamer from including political motifs in its decision . 
  this is rather controversial , as the eerste kamer is not elected directly - unlike the house of representatives ( ` tweede kamer ' ) . 
  besides not being elected directly , the turn-out for the provincial elections are rather low - if i 'm correct less than 50 percent of the voters turned out . 
  the eerste kamer therefore lacks the legitimacy which the - directly elected - tweede kamer has . 
  the eerste kamer should go back to its roots . 
  instead of doing so , it seems to become more and more of a political chamber , rather than doing which it did perfectly well in the past century ; being an auditory chamber . 
  a chamber that gave the tweede kamer sometimes a nudge * `` are you guys sure this really is a good idea ? 
  '' * the current attitude of the eerste kamer gives the tweede kamer plenty of reason to get rid of it all together . 
  so , eerste kamer , if you would go back to your roots and get back to doing what you were pretty good at , that would be great . 
  tl ; dr : our senate is behaving like a stray dog lately , where 's cesar milan when you need him ? 
  complimentary breathing pause for those , who are asthmatic . 
  or let 's just use their precious [ princess madeleine ] ( http://www.nhlsnipers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/princess-madeleine.jpg ) . 
  not even the [ groninger museum ] ( http://images0.tcdn.nl/incoming/article22066356.ece/binary/u/groninger+museum.jpg ) ? 
  my argument was that aachen can bring its claim for a germany court applying german law . 
  in addition , i implicitly stated german tort law can lead to an injunction , even on belgian soil . 
  i have not said anything about the actual state of belgian nuclear reactors ; i merely pointed out the possibilities . 
  i am done here . 
   `` the city of aachen is suing a neighboring nuclear station over claims of failure to fix safety issues at the aging plant . 
  the suit alleges that a reactor was brought back online with cracks in the protective concrete . 
  ( dw.com ) '' if you can prove ` failure to fix safety issues at an aging plant ' and/or ` bringing back online a nuclear reactor with cracks in the protective concrete ' , i can guarantee you that you are pretty much there . 
  do you think that for every type of conduct there is a specific provision on the law books ? 
  tort law can be used to sanction behaviour that is contrary to the law or contrary to , for instance , a duty of care . 
  if i leave open my basement hatch and someone falls into it , i have not broken any specific criminal rule ( provided that i did not press that person into the hatch , naturally ) . 
  yet , that person can hold me liable if it is established that i broke a duty of care . 
  now , you could argue that nothing went wrong yet . 
  thankfully , tort law does not force us to wait until after something went wrong . 
  if your neighbour has a tree which is highly unstable , and will likely fall on your house in the foreseeable future , you can go the judge and get an injunction to force your neighbour to remove that tree . 
  why do you think those principles do not hold for an apparently badly maintained nuclear reactor ? 
  if the city of aachen thinks there is an unsafe situation which may affect their city/citizen , it would be weird if they were * not * able to seek an injunction against the company managing the nuclear reactor . 
  since european regulations provide that in this scenario , aachen can fight this legal battle in german courts , applying german law , we do not have to bother with the laws or safety standards applicable in belgium . 
  the only role that they could play is that if they were breached , a claimant could rely on that fact to establish ` wrongfulness ' . 
  that 's nothing but a nice procedural aspect that makes your claim easier to prove . 
  tort law does not work that way . 
  why ? 
  you can initiate a tort claim on the basis that one ( in this case : the nuclear plant ) acts contrary to the standards of care . 
  naturally , it 's not a case that can be handled by a single lawyer within a day , but it is not legal rocket science either . 
  and in any case , a successful claim forces the other party to reimburse ( to some extent ) the costs incurred by the claimant . 
  you completely lost me here . 
  that is not a reason to make an international claim impossible . 
  if this case is a tort case , aachen can sue in germany , on the basis of german law . 
  see respectively the european rome ii ( substantive ) and brussels i ( jurisdictional ) regulations . 
  interesting . 
  i recall these provisions from my undergrad in law , and do not remember the scope of the provisions entirely . 
  i can see initiating proceedings in germany being more favorable than doing it in belgium . 
  article 5 ( 3 ) [ reg 44/2001 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/pdf/?uri=celex:32001r0044&amp;from=en ) :  a person domiciled in a member state may , in another member state , be sued : ( ... ) in * matters relating to tort * , delict or quasi-delict , in the courts for the place * where the harmful event * occurred or * may occur * ; in addition , article 7 of reg 864/2007 deals with the applicable law in tort claims arising from environmental damage . 
  does not have influence on the competence of the courts though . 
  that is what i quoted . 
  however , aachen is a german city . 
  the reactor is in belgium . 
  under brussels i , aachen has the right to bring the suit before a german court . 
  it is generally preferable to bring a lawsuit for your own courts instead of ` fighting ' on foreign territory . 
  hence , that is why i am confused . 
   the german city of aachen announced on tuesday it would launch a lawsuit against a nuclear power plant in belgium . 
  in a unanimous decision , the government for the metropolitan area * agreed to bring the suit to the belgian administrative court amid * ongoing safety concerns aachen said have yet to be addressed . 
  i wonder why . 
  under the brussels i regulation , the city of aachen should be allowed to bring the suit to a german court . 
  sure . 
  but do note that these are merely anecdotal examples . 
  the uk uses - like the us - a common law system , whereas continental europe uses a [ civil law system ] ( https://www.frenchentree.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/global_law_map.png ) . 
  uk judgements , quite similar to the us , tends to look to what 's agreed upon on paper , while continental europe tends to look to the intention of the parties . 
  no judgement on what is better system from my behalf intended . 
  uk knows concepts like parliamentary sovereignty , i.e. 
  whatever the uk parliament decides , irrespective of international treaties , holds true . 
  similar behaviour is expected from the us . 
  hence why the uk has trouble ` fitting in ' with europe , as europe ` asserts dominance ' , so to say . 
  from a business perspective , corporate governance in the uk is quite similar to that in the us - and both diverge greatly from the german system . 
  lastly they share a common language . 
  this inevitably leads to more cultural divergence . 
  would it be weird to state that uk and the us is probably more ` culturally aligned ' than germany and france are ? 
  or , if you want to leave some historical bias out , the netherlands and france ? 
  i do not so much think that the uk is like the us , but i do feel it 's more like the us when compared to the rest of europe . 
  que ?
