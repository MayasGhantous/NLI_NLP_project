  the eu27 's economy is roughly [ five times as big ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20170410-1 ) as that of the uk . 
  of course india would prioritise the eu over the uk when it comes to negotiating trade agreements ; there 's simply more to gain . 
  i will correct myself on the democrats slowwalking trump nominations , the senate is indeed taking longer to confirm trump nominees than was historically the case but [ trump has also been slower in nominating people ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/slow-pace-of-trump-nominations-leaves-cabinet-agencies-stuck-in-staffing-limbo/2017/04/25/0a150aba-252c-11e7-b503-9d616bd5a305_story.html?utm_term=.d6939624bd2d ) . 
  i also agree that clinton lacked a coherent message actually , but the idea that she ran on ` it 's her turn ' is total bullshit . 
  she had more policy proposals prepared than all of the other candidates put together , but did n't have a good theme to sell them with . 
  also , the media chose to basically ignore the policy debate ( and are still doing that in favour of covering the daily scandals and stupidity emanating from the trump administration , which is why it seems the dems have nothing to say on anything other than that ) . 
  that 's only one reason she lost though . 
  the comey intervention and the daily drip of dnc leaks were also responsible . 
  anyway , i 'm going to leave it at this and thank you for the discussion . 
  * the republicans in congress could easily help push trump out by letting the trumprussia investigations move along instead of slowwalking them , but they 're not doing so . 
  graham and mccain are the exceptions in being so critical , they 're not representative of the party as a whole . 
  the gop mainly wants someone capable of holding a pen and signing the laws coming out of congress and trump has given no indication that he wo n't do so . 
  * thanks to harry reid 's abolition of the filibuster for cabinet nominees , the democrats [ were powerless to stop trump 's nominees ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/4/donald-trumps-cabinet-nominees-aided-by-harry-reid/ ) . 
  the people who were nominated got confirmed quickly enough , even the manifestly unsuitable ones like ben carson . 
  the lack of nominees is mainly due to trump mismanagement in choosing the scandal-compromised chris christie to handle the transition and then firing him after the end of the bridgegate trial , and then ignoring the issue after that . 
  * i mentioned breitbart as part of the [ ecosystem of rightwing blogs and media ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/opinion/sunday/why-nobody-cares-the-president-is-lying.html?_r=1 ) . 
  there 's a lot of people who will never hear anything critical about trump as a result as to fox , it 's enough that it 's constantly trying to change the subject away from all of trump 's scandals . 
  * trump supporters being a minority might not hurt in the presence of the electoral college , but his margin of victory in crucial states was really thin . 
  next time , there will be no clinton on the ballot , and no endless coverage of emails . 
  and almost any democratic candidate is going to look good compared to trump , particularly if the ahca passes . 
  what has the republican party done to oppose trump ? 
  how is he being sabotaged when he himself has nominated hardly anybody at all to fill out all the executive branch functions needed to run the government ? 
  how is nearly the entire media against him when he has fox news , breitbart , and talk radio everywhere on his side ? 
  you 're also forgetting that fewer people supported trump in the election than supported hillary , and next time , trump might not be so lucky at where voters decide ( not ) to show up . 
   he intentionally puts spelling errors in his tweets [ citation needed ] you 're probably right that people in the media pointing out how dumb he is probably does n't harm him , but at some point voters will want tangible results and his utter and complete ineptitude is probably going to prevent him getting those . 
  i was thinking mostly in the way trump told lies in his speeches in rallies . 
  if you read what trump says in paper or on your screen , it has a totally different effect than if you were listening to him speak in a campaign rally . 
  in the first case , you can spot the patterns of how he lies and how he reacts . 
  in the second , you 're listening to a showman , and i do n't think many people do live factchecking when they 're listening to a performance . 
  and of course his performances got broadcasted extensively , while hillary 's speeches got ignored or always footnoted with her emails . 
  of course now that he is president the act is failing , since people do n't get to hear him speak every day ( and probably would n't be interested to ) and they 're able to evaluate him more critically . 
  so his magic only remains alive in the conservative bubble . 
  no , it looks more like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgxx56wqqjw )  . 
  trump has certainly had a lot of practice being a salesman so it stands to reason that he 'd be good at that . 
  also , his total disregard for truth makes him an exceptionally convincing liar . 
  but he 's the president now and does not appear to have changed his way of speaking at all from the campaign , except where he 's reading a prepared speech . 
  also , he will randomly bring up irrelevant stuff in speeches about the election months after its conclusion , go on about people being unfair to him and attack them , or parrot whatever he saw on fox news . 
  i think the effects of stress and old age are beginning to tell ( as well as what appears to be a horrible diet , a total lack of exercise , and a shortage of sleep ) . 
  [ apparently he used to be much more articulate ] ( https://www.statnews.com/2017/05/23/donald-trump-speaking-style-interviews/ ) . 
  anyway , i guess it does n't really matter what his vocabulary is like when everything he says is [ bullshit ] ( https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/30/15631710/trump-bullshit ) anyway . 
  the ` shadow education secretary ' is just the opposition party 's spokesperson/expert on education , who is presented as someone who would be education secretary if the opposition were in power instead . 
  they 're ` shadowing ' the education secretary as in , following their moves/policies/decisions and criticising them . 
  nothing spooky about it . 
  germany is competitive in manufacturing because of the high complexity ( technology content ) of its exports , meaning that it has no real competitors for many of the products it produces ( [ some background ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1212/why-germany-is-the-economic-powerhouse-of-the-eurozone.aspx ) ) . 
  this is thanks to the excellent domestic institutions and ( vocational ) education system built up over the course of centuries , and not thanks to currency manipulation . 
  furthermore , germany started on a strategy of increasing competitiveness through wage moderation in the late 90s already , and further improved its competitiveness with the harz iv reforms in the early 2000s . 
  germany 's preference has always been to have a strong currency , because it has a high savings rate and as such maintaining an artificially low exchange rate hurts german consumers , who could otherwise enjoy imports more cheaply . 
  this is also why all of the rules around the euro ( low inflation , fiscal discipline ) were set so as to maintain its value , not reduce it . 
  you are heavily overestimating the ability of policymakers to see into the future and understand the full consequences and implications of what they are doing . 
  letting greece in was largely the product of politics : wanting to make the euro a success and have as many countries as possible join it , and it was thought ( mistakenly ) that the greek economy and institutions would adapt once it had the euro . 
  bailing out greece in the short term prevented a messy exit from the euro and maybe the eu and the probable instant collapse of the greek economy , as well as stopping another disaster for european banks . 
  a greek bankrupcy might well have led to further pressure on the other crisis countries with risk of a systemic crisis . 
  if anyone had known what the consequences of the bailouts would have been maybe things would have been done differently . 
  or maybe not , because the alternative was too awful to contemplate . 
  just , as the saying goes , never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity . 
  boris johnson iirc suggested that obama was biased against the uk because of his kenyan heritage ( the uk in the 1950s suppressed a kenyan uprising against them through the widespread use of concentration camps , [ rape , torture , castration and other forms of mutilation ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/uk-compensate-kenya-mau-mau-torture ) . 
  the death toll ran into the tens of thousands ) . 
  maybe it caught on . 
  anyway , obama tried to disabuse the brits of the notion pushed by the leave campaign that the rest of the world stood ready to provide them with wonderful trade deals to replace the loss of trade with the eu by telling them that the americans were very busy with other deals and that the uk would be ` at the back of the queue ' for a deal if they left the eu . 
  this got resented . 
  in the real world though , trump too [ appears to be prioritizing ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-europe-iduskbn17o07z ) a deal with the eu over a deal with the uk . 
   i might be dead if i was n't wearing a helmet as a kid , once a flock of birds hit me while i was driving downhill ah , i see your problem there . 
  we do n't have any real hills here other than in the very south of our country . 
  i suppose living there would constitute an acceptable excuse too then  . 
  the only acceptable reasons for why you 'd be wearing a helmet in the netherlands would be if you were using your cycle for racing or had some form of epilepsy and you were at legitimate risk of falling over . 
  other than that , practically nobody wears helmets . 
  besides , countries were people are required to wear helmets [ are not actually more safe for cyclists ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/03/the-bike-helmet-paradox/273555/ ) , either because cyclists themselves feel free to take more risks or because car drivers take more risks around them . 
  for most kinds of political negotiations , i 'd agree with you on this point ; the sausage does n't get any more tasty if you watch how it 's made . 
  but brexit implies such a massive change in the legal order , in the rights to be enjoyed by all british citizens and the eu citizens in the uk , and in the trading relationship between the eu27 and the uk , and in financial flows ( e.g. 
  eu structural funds money for regions , the cap etc. ), 
  that people should know what their government is trying to negotiate . 
  in particular , extracting the uk from the eu will require rewriting many laws , and people should be made aware of how that is done like in any other democratic process . 
  this is all the more important since after the june elections , may is likely to have no real parliamentary opposition to speak of , and so no major check or balance on her power . 
  if this gives us another wonderful [ paul murray book ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/22/the-mark-and-the-void-by-paul-murray-review ) then i 'm happy . 
  [ irish gdp surpassed its 2008 peak in 2015 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/gdp ) . 
  [ it grew 4.3 % last year and is projected to grow over 3 % this year ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/ireland/news/winter-2017-economic-forecast_en ) . 
  if that does not show an ability to grow i do n't know what does . 
   when the supply of labor goes up , the price for that labor ( i.e. , wages ) goes down . 
  you 'd think so , but economists have found it surprisingly hard to establish that there is a relation between the increase in labour supply thanks to migration and wages . 
  there are many other factors at play , but the consensus as far as i 'm familiar with it is that immigration does not actually put downward pressure on wages except perhaps at the very bottom ( i am not really an economist either , though i sort of used to be ) . 
   i 'm not convinced though that those benefits are shared equally among all segments of society me neither actually ; i 'm actually convinced we need to reduce inequality period , also outside the contet of immigration . 
   something is n't working for them and has n't been for a long time ( and you ca n't blame austerity because ( 1 ) the problem precedes 2008 and ( 2 ) the us had the opposite of an austerity package but has still seen a frightening decrease in the quality of life for working class people going back many decades ) . 
  here i would argue that governments have in the west largely been cutting back on public services and the social safety net for a long time too , so that insufficient public social spending is a factor ( and also that the us has in fact had an austerity package carried out , not at the federal level but at the level of state budgets ) . 
  also the political war against labour unions leading to a loss in workerr bargaining power . 
  the most important factor though is really automation : robots cause far more job loss than immigrants do . 
  finally , it bears pointing out that the actual powers of the eu in labour market policy are limited to pooling knowledge , making recommendations , and spreading ideas . 
  other than setting some common minimum standards ( the working time directive etc. ), 
  the eu has no legal competences over the labour market . 
  it thus entirely lacks the power to force countries like france or the uk to reform their labour markets . 
  * gross domestic product ( gdp ) is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced * within a country 's borders * in a specific time period . 
  that is , polish workers in the uk do not directly contribute to polish gdp , * because they 're busy contributing to uk gdp instead * ! . 
  only the money they send home to poland gets spent or invested over there and as such contributes to polish gdp . 
  the value of these ` remittances ' amounts to between 1.5 to 2.5 % of gdp , i.e. 
  not nearly enough to explain poland 's growth rate . 
  * polish , or other eastern european workers are [ usually not low-skilled workers ] ( http://ukandeu.ac.uk/who-are-you-calling-low-skilled/ ) . 
  * the high unemployment rate in france can not be ascribed to immigration , because immigration does n't cause unemployment , and also , as a practical fact , the uk has a similar degree of immigration from the eu and has an unemployment rate that is close to 50 % lower !, 
  * more generally , this idea that immigrants displace native workers is known in economics as the ` lump-of-labour fallacy ' , i.e. 
  the idea that there are only so many jobs to go around . 
  however , in practice , immigrants contribute to demand by spending their wages on housing , food , transportation , paying taxes , public serrvices etc. 
  this extra demand creates extra jobs .
