i do n't think that the international community will accept an amendment in the geneva convention that permits people being traded for money . . 
  man am i suddenly hungry for some spaghetti . 
  it 's not like tear gas is n't the standard thing that european police forces deploy at every riot . 
  i do n't get this whole `` macedonia is so bad '' sentiment after that . 
  it 's tear gas , not mustard gas . 
  if someone steals your shoes and i buy them from him , that 's cool right ? 
  what i 'm trying to say is : give me your shoes . 
  have n't you heard that the way macedonia treats poor refugees is [ `` deplorable '' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36009497 ) ? 
  i 'm being serious here , most attention at least in the media here is on how your police officers and army are shooting tear gas and such at them . 
  sometimes the news reports omit the tear gas part and just say `` shooting at refugees '' . 
  accompanied by pictures of children and women behind a fence . 
  also that video of the macedonian officer that told a refugee he would `` die for his country '' did n't go over well either . 
  hence , because you guys have been branded as big bullies we 're doing the turkey deal because erdogan is much more humanitarian . 
  well if we 're looking purely on a public opinion level , the eu is currently making a big mess of things . 
  the turkey deal wo n't go over well . 
  but what to think of the dutch referendum being , essentially , ignored and the treaty with ukraine still going on ? 
  i 'm not saying these measures themselves are wrong , but it definitely will boost the pro-brexit camp in the uk tremendously . 
  before all of this i was fairly sure the uk would vote to remain in the eu . 
  now i honestly do not know anymore . 
  we ca n't stop the migrants ourselves , honestly . 
  the geneva convention means we technically need to accept any refugee that comes to our borders and asks for asylum , and with so many migrants having no passports or other identification papers we ca n't assume they 're * not * refugees . 
  so europe 's only option is to stop the stream of migrants before it reaches the borders of the eu . 
  as the geneva convention does n't apply * technically * if the refugee is not directly at your border asking to be let in . 
  hence we do n't have to say ` no ' , we can have turkey handle the problem . 
  or , before we decided to drop some bombs on the country , we had the libyan government say ` no ' for us . 
  unless we break the convention we 're bound by it . 
  and even then , how are you going to stop people that are circumventing border checks ? 
  build a big wall around europe ? 
  lay sea-mines all over the mediterranean and aegean ? 
  that in no way contradicts what i have said , or prevents governments from amending the treaty proposal after it is given to them . 
  ttip is a mixed competence agreement and does not fall under qmv voting . 
  it requires unanimity . 
  [ here ] ( https://stop-ttip.org/ttip-study-ratification/?noredirect=en_gb ) is a link to a study . 
  it is both in english and german and explains why ttip is a mixed competence agreement . 
  i did make a mistake picking malta randomly for my example though , as it is somewhat of an exception . 
  again , i agree with you that an independent international court would be preferable . 
  in practice , however , it would not come into existence . 
  it is a nice ideal but the international community ( of nations ) is not going to universally agree on how to do this . 
  let alone the united states recognizing the court at the hague . 
  it is a nice thought , an independent court . 
  but nobody is going to agree to have one . 
  so , because there must be * some * way of settling disputes , isds is thus far the way that is generally considered to be the best * compromise * . 
  again , it is not that an isds is somehow better than a hearing at an international court . 
  it is that none of the parties are going to agree to have such an international court . 
  the problem is that there is no such international public court . 
  so to get around that , there 's isds tribunals . 
  i am not saying they are good , but they are thus far the best solution for dispute settlements that people have come up with . 
  i completely agree with you that it would be ** far ** better to have such an international public court . 
  the problem is that it does n't exist and that it is nearly impossible to get everyone to agree on what it should look like . 
  you ca n't use the hague for ttip for example because it 's in europe and also the us has some issues with the court in the hague as it is . 
  so what do you use ? 
  do you make a new court in a different non-eu/us territory ? 
  do you make a new court like that for each treaty that is signed between new parties ? 
  and if for example you put the international public court for ttip in say , japan , and the us then forms a very beneficial treaty with japan , does that mean they might be influencing the court ? 
  it 's a very hard question that nobody seems to have a practically applicable answer to aside from isds . 
  i believe the level of secrecy of ttip is * the level of secrecy any international treaty negotiation has * . 
  nothing gets signed before it is made public . 
  maybe the ep can move between brussels , strassbourg and sydney now ? 
  w - well i would never want to be in the usa s-so there !, 
  if the us does not pass the required regulations that they agree to do in in ttip , then ttip is null and void . 
  so you can be assured that if ttip says that the us government is going to raise standards to a certain level for something , they will pass the needed legislation to do so . 
  this is simply because before signing ttip the us government will have made very sure that everything they promise in the treaty is something they can actually deliver on , because us law binds them to obey international agreements they are a part of . 
  basically , if the us does not put in place the required regulations to meet their promises in the treaty they are breaking it , which is against us law ( and also voids the treaty ) . 
  this means that for ttip they will not commit to anything they ca n't pass . 
  after they sign it , they * have * to pass every regulation they promised in ttip that they would pass . 
  do you mean the isds systems ? 
  those are pretty standard in trade treaties and the eu has large numbers of them in place in for example the treaty with canada . 
  the idea is that they are not really a way for corporations to sue governments for profit , but protect investors from governments breaking their promises . 
  say you got a permit by the government of germany to build a coal mine , you start to finalize your plans and everything is set to go and suddenly due to new elections , the new german government says `` only german companies can mine coal in germany '' . 
  you now have lost tons of money as a company and can take germany to an isds to reach a settlement . 
  isds itself are not that bad ** if implemented correctly ** . 
  what makes isds risky in ttip is that they cover a far broader area ( so companies can start isds procedures over a much greater number of things ) , ttip itself is a very large treaty , and finally the standards between the u.s. and eu are very different and as these files show , these standards are a point of contention . 
  if the standards themselves were not a point in the treaty , corporations could essentially not take states to an isds tribunal over a different in health standards as the eu and us would never agree to link their health and safety standards together so investors would be aware beforehand of this . 
  however , as we can read in these files , the us wants the eu to abandon the precautionary principle ( burden of proof is on proving something * is * safe . 
  as opposed to the us system that places the burden of proof on the side that says something is * not * safe ) . 
  this makes isds ** very dangerous ** as now , health and safety standards are potentially linked between the eu and the us and neither side can change their standards without being liable to be sued by investors , as the ttip treaty would link them together . 
  this is less of a problem for the us as their health and safety standards are not based on the precautionary principle and thus generally far less restrictive . 
  unless your country is run purely by direct democracy , and it is not because no country in the world is , then every single negotiation that your government has ever had , has been in secret . 
  you clearly have no idea how the eu works . 
  governments do not sign the deal . 
  governments give the eu permission to sign the deal . 
  the eu does not get the ability to sign it without permission from ** all ** the member states and the european parliament . 
  if for example the luxembourg government wanted to stop ttip it could , since a luxembourg `` no '' means that the eu will simply not be able to sign the treaty . 
  edit : changed malta to luxembourg because malta happens to be a bad example due to its constitution . 
  you have no idea how the eu works . 
  the commission has no power to sign anything into law . 
  it can not do this . 
  it performs the negotiations because it is the only eu institution with the power to speak on behalf of the eu on the international stage . 
  the only thing the commission can do is work out a ** potential ** deal with the other party . 
  then it takes this ** proposal ** to the member states who have to agree unanimously to sign it . 
  the commission can not sign ttip . 
  it is the negotiator , not the enactor . 
  it negotiates , then goes to the member states and shows `` this is a common position we negotiated that we think might work for everyone '' . 
  if even one national government of a member states ( so elected officials ) disagrees with it , the treaty is not signed and it 's either back to the negotiation table for the commission or the whole treaty is tabled . 
  are you just trolling at this point or not reading it right ? 
  he 's giving a hypothetical example to clarify his explanation . 
  because you give away your negotiating position and public opinion also locks it in , giving your side no room to maneuver . 
  you are clearly correct . 
  only the united kingdom stood up against the nazis . 
  the countries of poland , albania , serbia , france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , denmark , greece , norway , romania , yugoslavia , ukraine , and probably several i am forgetting ^ ^ ^ ( sorry ! ),
