  the second point on reducing immigration is something member states are often not picking up on to the satisfaction of the population . 
  hence for example the pvv is so high in the netherlands , fn is doing pretty good in france and ukip is doing good in britain , just to name a few western members . 
  national governments can deflect criticism to the eu quite easily . 
  this stops when the eu actually takes a hard line on immigration control . 
  the turkey deal is not a good example because working together and giving lots of money to erdogan , a textbook crazy dictator at this point , is not going over well with pretty much any eu citizen . 
  i 'd advice her to wear trousers with some pingpongs to simulate it for the experience . 
  but unfortunately women are n't allowed to wear them , i just read . 
  oh i agree with your sentence , i would just replace ` kindhearted ' with ` civilized ' . 
  they should know the risks and maybe they did . 
  that does n't mean that it is normal , mentally stable , behavior what the locals in that area did though . 
  there should n't be any risks for just walking through a suburb asking residents if they want to be interviewed . 
  aside from you moving the goalposts right now , it 's also totally normal for journalists to interview people on the street . 
  you can just say you 're not interested in being interviewed , instead of having some kind of mental breakdown and beginning to chuck rocks at them like an idiot . 
  dude it 's not a gated community , it 's a public venue . 
  everyone is ` supposed to be there ' because it 's a street . 
  i do n't think you can say `` they had it coming '' when we are talking about violently attacking someone with rocks . 
  or without rocks for that matter . 
  if you attack people over walking around in your neighborhood , even if you severely disagree with their ideological views , you have serious problems . 
  guys pull back frontex and call off the troika , if we stop ttip our troubles will be over . 
  you mean the stereotype that they attack people with rocks ? 
  everything above the great rivers is the north . 
  they 're like a great wall . 
  and then half the carriage full of rowdy lads is going to beat you into the hospital to protect blondie 's honor . 
  [ wiz predicted it ] ( https://youtu.be/ueptoxdhjsw ), 
  it 's a 1,8 kilometer long pizza . 
  i do n't think taste was the main thing they were concerned with . 
  they have a wheeled oven slowly run along the length of the pizza . 
  that is true , mainstream culture does accept homosexual and other lgbt people . 
  i was mainly arguing that the parade is still needed because just because we have legalized gay marriage , does n't mean the country is 100 % accepting and open to homosexuals . 
  half naked people !, 
  let 's go beat them up/harrass them ! '', 
  a day at the beach must be torture for homophobes . 
  to be honest , we still have a fairly significant amount of of homophobia . 
  this is significantly so in religious communities and certain culture groups that are heavily built on macho/patriarchal culture . 
  just to give a relatively recent example : a morroccan gay couple was extremely and sometimes violently harassed in the city of utrecht for years by teenagers . 
  the city could/would not stop this and recommended the couple to move . 
  in 2010 , they did . 
  then , in 2012 , it was revealed that the teenagers had followed the couple to their new home and the harassment had not stopped . 
  this is true , and berniebros and rabid antifas and so on can be crazy too . 
  but there are frankly less of them . 
  bernie sanders did n't even make it past the primaries , trump blazed through and straight into the white house . 
  also i would n't say there is anything comparable to infowars on the left . 
  all of this is sad though . 
  it should n't be a competition of which side is more or less crazy than the other . 
  from an outsider 's perspective , it looks like partisanship is completely ripping the us apart and destroying it from within . 
   the consensus is that there are risks can you please cite a few ( proper peer-reviewed ) scientific articles that conclude that the mmr vaccine has significant , quantifiable , risks associated with it ? 
  no weblogs please , just empirical research . 
  like 4 or 5 articles ? 
  since you say there is consensus it should be easy to find , i imagine . 
  what i mean is that in this particular case , if some semblance is justice is to be served , the case should be viewed in and of itself . 
  the greater debate surrounding this practice should of course be had , but right now at this very moment it is not criminal to circumcise a young boy with parental consent . 
  i would hope it is criminal to do it * without * and that the assholes that did this can be brought to justice . 
  while obviously the boy was circumcised over religious beliefs , from a legal standpoints this case should not be seen with religious beliefs in mind . 
  as you can see from the way the police and politicians refuse to burn their hands on the case , injecting a religious angle into this will just make it harder to get justice . 
  it does not matter * why * the kid was circumcised ( and also , it is legal to circumcise over religious beliefs ) , it matters that a surgical procedure was done on an infant without consent of the parents . 
  that is the immediate crime here , the lack of parental consent . 
  i fully agree that male circumcision ( or genital mutilation if you want to call it that , since that 's the usual name if a similar ( ish ) procedure is done for women ) should be done only with the consent of the person getting circumcised . 
  not their parents . 
  regardless of belief system . 
  reading this article and some of the comments is honestly very saddening . 
  i think it is important to note that while the debate about male infant circumcision involves religion and men 's rights , etc. , this case is ** not about the legitimacy of male infant circumcision . 
  ** it does a tremendous disservice to this poor boy and his mother to immediately inject religion and gender politics into this discussion . 
  all that has happened here is that , for whatever reason , a child 's bodily integrity was compromised without consent of his parent . 
  it is precisely because people inject religion into this case that the police and law enforcement do not care . 
  but this case has nothing to do with religious beliefs . 
  a doctor can not treat a non-life threatening injury on a baby without parental consent . 
  if you do not want your baby to be vaccinated , it is criminal for someone to take your baby and stick it with the vaccine needle anyway . 
  the only time it is acceptable to perform any medical procedure without consent is if this procedure is the only way the person 's life can be saved . 
  ** this ** is how this case should be seen . 
  the reason why the baby was circumcised is irrelevant right now . 
  the fact that there was no parental consent * and * it was a botched job is . 
  making this into a larger discussion about religious rights and gender rights does nothing but make it controversial and ultimately lead to nothing being done out of fear . 
  meanwhile this is an extremely clear-cut case : child was surgically treated without parental consent . 
  as such , arrest and try those responsible for this crime . 
  the discussion about `` religion is so bad '' and `` men 's rights/feminism '' muddies this case and should be had * after * justice has taken place . 
  edit : just to clarify , of course religion played a role in why this boy was circumcised . 
  however it should not be about the * why * but simply that a child 's body was violated without parental consent . 
  that should make it a very clear-cut issue and i hope that if it is seen purely in this light , some measure of justice can be exacted . 
  adding a whole religious angle into this will just ruin the chances of anything being done for this poor child and his mom . 
  i really just want the assholes who did this to be brought to justice , the greater debate about this issue should be had separately . 
  it 's not religious practice to do these things without parental consent . 
  this is about violating a child 's bodily integrity without parental consent . 
  not feminism or men 's rights . 
  for the purposes of this article i can overlook the debate about whether male circumcision of children is good or bad . 
  this is secondary to what happened in this situation . 
  the primary issue is that someone can take another person 's child , get it circumcised and that this is considered fine by law enforcers and legislators . 
  children are unable to consent to anything . 
  we place that responsibility on the parents and if something goes wrong with the child , we hold the parents responsible . 
  in this case the parent was not even informed . 
  the child 's bodily integrity was compromised and no matter how you feel about unnecessary circumcision of infants , any decisions that alter a child 's body can only be taken by the parent . 
  i would be equally livid if a baby had a cough and a doctor decided to cut out the child 's tonsils without asking the parent ( s ) for permission . 
  this is clearly criminal and the fact that the police and legislators are unable to give this the light of day is very upsetting . 
  i do n't know the reason behind this , but at the risk of speculating i can only think that they do n't want to burn their hands on anything even getting close towards criticizing religious beliefs . 
  that is not what this is though . 
  this case is entirely detached from religion . 
  sure , the motivations of the grandparents are religious in nature , but at the core someone violated an infant 's bodily integrity ** without parental consent ** . 
  religion or not this should have heavy consequences and it saddens me that it does not . 
  i think this might be nsfw . 
  oh no , i did n't mean to take that tone , sorry if it sounded that way . 
  i honestly am not sure of the process .
