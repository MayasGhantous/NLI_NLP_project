disturbing on many levels . 
  well , the dutch culture is mostly liberal , protestant and ( relatively ) tolerant , and really diverse because of the good old spirit of the merchant . 
  this diversity however caused most of the current dutch to forget about their culture , hence why we are n't nationalistic at all . 
  this made us become more ` sober ' . 
  italy has known a far greater history , with their roman empire stationed in most parts of europe . 
  it also bloomed during the renaissance , with their great roman catholic church and their widespear influence concerning literature , art , religion and much more . 
  italy did not achieve this with trading , nor can we say that they are protestant and liberal . 
  luther and calvijn had far more influence in the netherlands rather than in italy . 
  people in italy are way more nationalistic than here , because they have a history that is far more acknowledged as the centerpiece of everything , yet in italy the people are far more concerned with ( family ) traditions rather than in the netherlands . 
  the only moments that i 've seen real dutch nationalism were during the wc of soccer and our inauguration of our king and queen . 
  i would n't say that the netherlands and italy have cultural similarities . 
  i remember he said something in the lines of not bowing down to protesters . 
  he is really stubborn , so it would be considered `` weird '' for him to actually give in , or back down . 
  . . unsuprising . 
  probably , lots of stray animals in the turkish cities . 
  it felt like watching a 9 year old using his watergun against others . 
  i 'd rather have the eu fix things up first before we add another fault . 
  glad he did n't die . 
  he 's really lucky not to have severe consequences of that . 
  imo de telegraaf , algemeen dagblad ( ad ) and sp!ts are those papers . 
  might want to check with other dutch people . 
  it was my intention to summarize it into a general ` provoke ' because ripping up the koran was a provocative action , since it was in front of a bunch of muslims and his intention was to piss them off ( which worked , clearly ) . 
   you do n't like to admit that ripping up the koran was a factor in his arrest no intentions of that sort was implied . 
  it was a factor , yes , but in this case the accused person was someone who already committed a crime before , hence why his penalty was 4 months instead of a nolle prosequi . 
  it usually ends up being a nolle prosequi because the prosecutors have no foot to stand on . 
  but in this case , they did . 
  quoting from wikipedia what the exact specifications are :  among others , the following acts were made illegal by the anti-racism law :  * incitement to discrimination , hatred or violence against a person on account of race , colour , origin or national or ethnic descent , in the circumstances given in article 444 of the belgian penal code ;  * incitement to discrimination , segregation , hatred or violence against a group , community or its members on account of race , colour , origin or national or ethnic descent , in the circumstances given in article 444 of the belgian penal code  * announcing the intention to commit any of the aforementioned offences , in the circumstances given in article 444 of the belgian penal code . 
   if he did n't provoke them , this situation would n't have happened and he would n't be arrested . 
  thought that was a clear `` no '' . 
  from what i know this man was involved in a demonstration of a far right party called vlaams belang . 
  afterwards he went to a cafeteria and provoked the muslims sitting at the same cafeteria . 
  if he did n't provoke them , this situation would n't have happened and he would n't be arrested . 
  well yeah there are anti racism laws in belgium , trying to prevent any ways of xenophobia and since discrimination is against the law , he was arrested for discriminating ( just like people from sharia4belgium get arrested based on the same law for spreading hatred ) . 
  true , true . 
  sorry for misunderstanding . 
  modest consumption meaning one glass of wine . 
  another glass counteracts this effect . 
  and yeah , people can die from eating too much food or drinking too much water , but my point with that statement is that it 's better to drink 1 liter of water than 1 liter of beer . 
  still , no one ever got laid because of that extra glass of water they drank which made them push over the line to have a good time with someone . 
  i 'm half turkish and i find that the akp is really being detestable . 
  they say it 's to protect the health of citizens . 
  i agree that alcohol is a commonly accepted poison ( i drink a little ) but this is far from being a regular health bill . 
  ataturk would n't want this at all , these people are trying to jail others for 2 years and fine them for a huge amount of money for the fact that they drink alcohol . 
  raising awareness about how retarded it is to drink bottles of vodka/raki , sure . 
  but not like this . 
  there most likely would n't be a lawsuit against him if his only crime was ripping the koran , since it was repetitive disorderly behaviour that caused him to get the punishment . 
  based on an anti-islam blog ( that copies it from other anti-islam/pro christian blogspot ) and pasted on a website that does n't check their sources for authenticity . 
  belgium news has said that it was because of his prior deeds ( which were n't the typical nice deeds e.g. 
  burning a forest ) that he needed to learn how to behave . 
  yeah , i agree my comment was superficial . 
  it 's just , they downgraded the usa only in 2011 when they had problems with their debt years before . 
  and with greece they started downgrading when their whole financial situation became laid out . 
  it 's not predicting the weather , it 's describing what happened before and making a summary of their current situation by a rating . 
  i do n't care what they say , credit rating agencies are bullshit . 
  i thought someone was supposed to say `` name three ... '' and that the person below him answers the question . 
  i taught . 
  myself english by watching tv when i was young , which mostly consisted out of animal planet , nat geo , discovery channel , etc. 
  so i guess it 's the american variety of english . 
  however i started to mix them up , like saying color and football instead of color/soccer and colour/football , so i went with the british variety since soccer sounds stupid . 
  putting nuance in these claims costs time and removes the power of the words when they are being spoken . 
  hence why some people usually do n't put nuance in their phrasing , while they mean the same thing . 
  if poverty arises , so will populism . 
  well , he does need to represent the greek stereotype . . 
  most of the times you say there , it should be their . 
  yeah , i figured . 
  thanks anyway . 
  op , can i ask why you submitted this ? 
  that would be alde , then . 
  honestly i keep forgetting that these elections exist . 
  for now , atleast . 
  i 'd like to see the eu and turkey cooperate more . 
  if there wo n't be a nutter such as erdo\u011fan , leading the country . 
  would n't it be more logical if the cause was that they simply can not afford electricity in those regions ? 
  and latvian . 
  weird , usually when i go to the barber he takes only 40 % of my hair . 
  [ ha ] ( http://dutchreviewing.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/animaatjes-geert-wilders-25201.jpg ), 
  exactly . 
  it 's not like that everything will get better when they leave the euro . 
  they do n't have a lot of choice . 
  finland sure likes grannies . 
  lets hope that most of the traditionals will not interfere . 
  redneck opinions usually do not require sources . 
  to be honest , i am really suprised to see self-burning in europe as a form of protest . 
  you 're most welcome . 
  it 's a small newspaper compared to the hurriyet , but nevertheless accurate . 
  yeah , i 'd rather not have those parties in power . 
  also , i personally prefer http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/ but i do check both websites . 
  that is what i thought at first . 
  but from what i heard of the dutch news and my ( turkish ) family , he really tries to censor all criticism against his reign and atat\u00fcrk and make the country more islamised in a way the christian democrats would only dream of . 
  still , under erdo\u011fan the economy has been running fine . 
  from what i heard , i think the chp suits more to my taste but i do n't know how the chp is , since i do n't follow all of the turkish politics . 
  erdo\u011fan is a bit of a nutter , but most of the turks are friendly people i assure you . 
  he basically owns all of the media , so yeah . 
  do n't worry , you 're still number one for us . 
  our politicians can learn a lot from them . 
  in the netherlands we have basic education ( basisschool ) from ages 4 to 12 . 
  it has a total of eight grades . 
  after the eight grade you go to high school . 
  from here on you can either go to ** vmbo ** , ** havo ** or ** vwo ** vmbo is the lowest out of the three ( preparatory middle-level applied education ) , and it has 4 grades . 
  it 's divided in 5 different parts , from high to low : * vmbo-tl ( theoretical education ) * vmbo-gl ( mixed education , both theoretical and practical ) * vmbo-kb ( middle management-orientated ) * vmbo-bb ( basic profession-orientated ) * vmbo-pro ( practical education - meant for people who ca n't achieve a diploma with the other 4 educations .
