yeah why cant they make up some bullshit reason like normal people . 
  yeah they should have put it on paper . 
  and the russia establishment will say anything , only relating to truth in a tactical sense . 
  not sure where i got the idea that joining nato was more recent than it was . . 
  still , fact remains , joining nato is not the only way of protecting those states . 
  europe is not a passive victim , if it is acting like that , * is * bad policy . 
  neither does russia 's bad establishment excuse treating it in a way that causes bad responses from russia . 
  and `` not interfering with internal affairs '' ? 
  well , i * suppose * our establishment sucks to much to do it . 
  lets say that wasnt true , would it * even be sane * to leave a country with nuclear bombs to go whatever way it goes politically , to do nothing in that context ? 
  could we really not have flown a drone with a banner against militarism when the russians have one of their gay little parades ? 
  ( like happened in a recent football match ) perhaps that is * not * up to europe , this is more a point against our society , no-one in our society is going out and spread notions like anti-divide-and-conquer ( that 'd be racism , class-ism , nationalism , ` hard working ' vs the lazies etc ) anti-facism and anti-militarism , even though we * clearly * have an interest in having the public in a nuclear-power ( practically ) neighbour empowered and informed . 
  spreading the word is * hardly * `` breaking the sovereignity '' of a country . 
  to be frank , we could probably have done much better . 
   when they were freed from soviet clutches , the first thing they wanted is to be shielded from future invasions or geopolitical meddling . 
  so they requested nato membership , and nato obliged . 
  except you forgot that there was a promise not to expand nato eastward , and it is nearly * eight * years before poland got included , and some of the other baltics are only being included now . 
  the reason they are under threat might well be due to deterioration of the relationship . 
  really , i cant argue well why i think the establishment here didnt handle russia . 
  that is my general sense , their lack of clear stance and option to the russians to retreat is one reason , the whole debacle with the russian-dutch year another . 
  [ hueys are choppers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bell_uh-1_iroquois ) . 
  ( and typo ), 
  thats not how you do it , [ this is how you do it !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfzev7tezbg ) ( lessig at mit : `` tweedism '' ), 
  it being pathetic doesnt help the victims . 
  ask north korea . 
  or , maybe , ask our future selves . 
  quite frankly , i do not think our ` leadership ' has played this well at all . 
  nato moving east is * probably * just a pretext , but what use did we * really * have for moving nato into the old east block ? 
  have doubts about it being useful enough , even if all we get is to give russia a bit more contorted pretext . 
  instead of incorporating into nato , couldnt we have pacted those countries . 
  also , presumably , when the ussr fell , basically a new ( ish ) government was set up . 
  not sure what sort of influence the west had on it , but it didnt work out . 
  talking propaganda , i saw some yesterday on dutch tv . 
  not much less ridiculous . 
  those heuys hanging in the sky standing still and the small army with armored vehicles with terrible aim . 
  ( or ... maybe it is great , and they should work at a circus ) [ there it is ] ( http://www.tvgids.nl/strijd_op_vijandelijke_grond/artikel/69614/ ) , `` behind enemy lines '' . 
  it is not a part of human nature at all . 
  it is a consequence of human nature . 
  it is the consequence of ignorance and the tendency to follow authority . 
  well , i dont know what it is a consequence of that well , but to call war part of human nature denies the fact that the same aspects of ` human nature ' - really , culture and the status quo , that causes war is around us . 
  would probably better to just nag and make a fuss about it , instead of ... frankly , cowering away ? 
  reddit is a place where lots of people express their opinions , and they should not have a right to block that . 
  if they need security . . well they should have separate devices for that , i mean security good enough for parliament + full browsing of regular web ? 
  its an unrealistic aim in the first place . 
  use tor with a bridge . 
  [ read this one . . ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jdysz/beyond_parody_national_union_of_students_wont/clavu49 ), 
  someone thought , oh dear , revolution at the door ... 
  they 'll be starting marches soon . . 
  wait they 're anti capitalists !, 
  maybe we can find some other cooky anti capitalists and smear the whole thing !, 
  and then use our ownership of lots of media to dimish it !, 
  got ta start soon with that !, 
  oeh . . just looked down , [ * apparently * they couldnt even find cooky enough people . . ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jdysz/beyond_parody_national_union_of_students_wont/clavu49 ) gasp !, 
  left wing students actually being rational human beings !? 
  of course , that is not exactly how it works . 
  they presumably dont give media organization direct orders , at least ones that sound out at the workplaces themselves . 
  maybe they just have different people with different biases and tickle them appropriately , and some carrots and sticks . . btw , for the record capitalism \u2260 free market . 
  capitalism is when you raise a lot of . . capital for stuff , using stuff like stock markets . 
  in the current context , it is the owning of our resources ( incl . 
  ` human ' ) by private parties . 
  practicing for future carreers ? 
  well that implies their motivation might be their own carreers , remove that implication . 
  no bullshit in the 3d animations , yay !, 
  but you cant keep nato or the eu parlament secure through obscurity . 
  also , i dont know how well that works , i mean , it isnt being updated , so a vulnerability on the powerbook will last long . 
  and it is not like an attacker has to remember it , presumably they basically use a database and automatically find vulnerabilities for whatever you 're on . 
  on the other hand , stuff like that does help . 
  * regular browsing , and some other activities . 
  using a computer with no mike or camera , infact , have it talk to a wireless device that doesnt tell it where the computer is at either , and behind a vpn . 
  this computer must be consider infected . 
  + mind that stuff like accelerometers can detect sound too , and typing in the neighbourhood . 
  people will want to use their own computers . . + yah , the raspberry pi can emit [ radio ] ( http://www.instructables.com/id/raspberry-pi-radio-transmitter/ ) with just a little wire on a pin . 
  definitely a possibility to happen w/o modification on regular computers . 
  everything else is done on a second computer . 
  whatever everything else means . . you need a stick to get people to use it . . * everything shall be open source . 
  * documents should all be converted into a * single * simple format . 
  ( minimizing surface area of parsing lots of file formats . ), 
  this format will be used for everything . 
  ( edit : programs are made available that convert other files types into that format ) + equivalent of . pdf , . html + email messages . 
  ( that functionality ) + chat . 
  * the os should implement mac , and that should extend to user files . 
  * * all * communications shall be public-key encrypted . 
  + users should know how to use paper private keys with any part of the system . 
  + infact , we probably want to hide who is talking to who . 
  * audio should have a hardware switch on there , cameras should have a occluding patch [ and a hardware switch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkxoucxb4a8 ) . 
  it might be an idea to again implement a separate public key for each microphone-speaker pair . 
  one that is not accessible to the computer . 
  * code tests and static analysis . 
  and pentests . 
  also , you need measures to ensure that the devices are actually programmed with the correct code . 
  possibly use a sd card that contains the entire state , and scrutinize the contents with another computer . 
  also ... [ sd cards themselves can betray you too ] ( http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3554 ) . 
  ( everything is a hole . . ) policy has to deal with people dragging a lot of phones in . 
  possibly too draconian/hard to disallow , give people faraday cages for their phones and ask them to use that . ( i.e. 
  tinfoil bag ) instead : still using windows , haha . 
  obviously , i dont think linux is safe either , if you at all read the above . 
  note : yes i am nutty . . 
  gave it a shot . 
  it is important that it stays a resource that the public has a good degree of control over though ... and i do not think that privatization is compatible with that .
