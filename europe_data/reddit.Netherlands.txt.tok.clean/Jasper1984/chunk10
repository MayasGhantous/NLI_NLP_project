  * exactly * the kind of thing that makes stuff like wwii possible . 
  i do know how they might do better ; they should just look at things that are perceived as risks to freedom and peace , and where elsewhere in the world those are risked , and why . 
  i do think that advertising tries to get under your skin aswel . 
  for instance ` nose blindness ' , tries to push in that meme . 
  or the veneration of cars tries to associate cars and a particular kind of person . 
  or merely marketing to children , who might not have the cognitive skills to separate ad from reality . 
  some of these things , like the `` admiration of cars '' pre-exist . 
  i do n't think the culture and the commercial push there is entirely separable . 
  entire brands exists just for feel-value . 
  infact , lets call `` brands '' the ones that get under your skin , and `` trademark '' the marks of the trade by which you recognize a product . 
  if a product appears on the internet , there is always the question how it got there . 
  i think if a centralized server is used by millions , eventually cant trust it . 
  or it effectively becomes a cabal ; trusted implicitly . 
  ( i use this word , because the haskell packaging tool uses that name , probably it 's a joke ) point is , i do feel generaly at unease about the flow of information . 
  i suppose the soviet union was far worse in many way , and perhaps , i am just seeing issues as . . in the way of progress . 
  the establishment never sees itself as in the way of progress , but just making new products is not going to solve some of the problems we have . 
  there is also the concern of risks me may run . 
  well such alliance forming was part of the reasons for wwi . 
  but things seem far less polarized now , and it 'd turn into a ( probably more dangerous ) cold war immediately . 
  but also , really , sure , those coalitions could be good for peace . 
  but their mere existence doesnt say that much about how the societies are organized internally . 
  fox news : hurr hurr freedom !, 
  someone using the freedom to be egalitarian [ get the pitch forks !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shnlrsu2h90 ) in some ways , they do better at freedom of enterprise i think . 
  in part because they can ; they have room . 
  but investors push their angle . 
  europe exists for the people , and some liberties are more important than the advantages the eu brings . 
  and whether the eu is good depends on what it does . 
  i mean the eu has expanded far beyond steel & coal thing intended to make future wars impossible . 
  the euro was , in part , the result of hubris , and as is the sentiment against the eu . 
  missing from the article is hungary ( if i remember correctly ) which had anti-free speech tendencies , and standing up against corporatism , like preventing lobbying from being too powerful , and saying no to race-to-the-bottom treaties like ttip . 
  ( yeah . . the vvd in the nl basically wants it . . from what i heard , the goddamn things effectively gives multinationals a special - better - legal status . . ), 
  well , `` we '' is basically the us/eu . 
  and there was talk of arming the rebels/air strikes . 
  so yes , we were definitely siding . 
  but presumably they dont all end up fighting for isis . 
  and remember , until recently we were supportive of anti-assad fighters . 
  also , i dont agree . 
  people do change sometimes . 
  the perspective is that france put up a ridiculously long state of emergency , at a time terrorism is far less than the 60ies or 70ies . 
  and that was used on unrelated protests at cop21 . 
  ( they were only allowed the last day ) the perspective is that hungary has become significantly undemocratic , and turkey is also heading the wrong way . 
  that greek democracy basically has to bend to creditors , and that the eu is controlled increasingly technocratically . 
  the perspective is that people used to laugh has east-germanies control . 
  but then added dots to our printers to make sure who printed that stuff . 
  that it is apparently an * economic * concern to not track all that stuff , not a * moral * , or * ideological * one . 
  the perspective is that this basically was always the case to different extents , but that kissinger is still admired and part of the establishment . 
  despite his complicity in genocides in indochina , indonesia , and east timor , to just name a few . 
  personally , i think * this * example is more one of people being dumb in how to respond to search results and what ends up available to said search results . 
  not particularly to do with said perspective . 
  of course the effect on public opinion remains ;  [ i mean , it 's not like we could just demand to see the code that 's governing our lives . 
  what right do we have to poke around in facebook 's private affairs like that ? 
  [ here is a long-ass video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd4owt05-zm&amp;t=2h32m42s ) , starts at 2h32m30s . 
  the american guy , james gay . . something . . ( didnt catch it properly ) that helped yanis has some important to say . 
  edit : funny how they defend being `` utopian '' , of course , ambition is only a thing for the technical realm , `` of course '' being impossible in the cultural/moral realm . 
  yeah , there was this kung fu guy in a car crusher too . 
  spoiler : got crushed . 
  really worked wonders , that kung fu . 
  well he still has a right to a lawyer . 
  and i dont think it is necessarily a good things to `` use that '' for the same reason that it angers people . 
  no it is not . 
  if kids play with fire , near a curtain , you can tell them they 're terribly lucky for not burning down the house . 
  the only reason you believe that it means you deserve it is because you 're the equivalent to an egotistical kid . 
  obviously it is not . 
  the joke is that we 're connected to these events , but want to live in protective bubbles . 
  that is not to say that we 're not incredibly lucky for the low , low levels of terrorism towards the west resulting from its actions . 
  i do n't think it was all that clear cut , or applied in a non-hypocrit , consistent way . 
  but think this is a great statement . 
  maybe a bit much is lost from [ this more complete variant ? ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/40xgu8/kouloglou_yes_men_antiterrorism_hoax_eu_parliament/ ) . 
  ( edit : go terrible noise in these sometimes ) an earlier submission was removed as `` low effort '' . 
  edit : in this case people are sort-of co-operating with it , of course . 
  i still think they 're doing a great thing . 
  we 're not allowed to decide this for ourselves . 
  which rule is it ? 
  like 1m immigrants vs 500m europeans it wo n't thin out very quick . . that 90 % probably isnt a real number . 
  also , he doesnt actually go into why hitler mustache might have been drawn actually . 
  http://www.ifla.org/publications/the-new-press-and-media-act-in-hungary the excess of corporate/financial/elites power is real though . 
  various mechanisms , like lobbying , [ propaganda model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda_model ) , revolving doors , similar socioeconomic backgrounds , race to the bottom , control of the decisions of the big companies create that power . 
  the eu is just another turd if it can not keep them off . 
  edit : or absurdity of `` oh no where are the refugees coming from now , why now ? '', 
  arab spring , droughts in africa and syria , wars in iraq , afghanistan ( it flared up , but the establishment , doesnt want to go back , so keep it quiet ) syria . 
  ( yemen ) furthermore , i have seen zero evidence of any campaign advocating the movement of populations . 
  ( well of course , as it happens , the news reports naturally act as such . ), 
  i think it is what it looks like , they feel obliged to take in people who come from war zones they co-caused . 
  nevertheless the way it happens , i sometimes feel they 're purposefully fuelling anti-immigration people . . 
  this whole `` it was organized '' conspiracy theory ... is there any evidence for it . 
  / u/roaringsilence might be right . . ( edit : not his words ) the facists ( - enablers ) come in different colors . 
  some sincerely believe that panopticon will be allright . 
  before you promote your fancy panopticon dystopia , when there were riots in the uk before , * did * they actually arrest these people ? 
  but then so should kissinger , who recently attended a funeral in germany with zero fear . 
  ( not sure if we should use the visit to the funeral , but probably , yes ) ( edited : removed unfinished sentence , fuck it ), 
  plus , we should call antidemocratic/anti-civil-rights shit in turkey what it is , having the camps there might hamper that . 
  unfortunately we can say similar threat to anti-free-speech etcetera about frances ' `` state of emergency '' . 
  it seems like states and the eu are * not exactly good * . 
  i mean i wish we could do better than `` i guess what we have here is better '' . 
  the kkk was basically terrorist , so i guess all whites are fair game . 
  edit : for the record i am sarcastic . 
  and it * is * exactly the same argument as / u/damir33 uses non-sarcastically . 
  yeah the title is sensational . . 
  i should have edited it .
