  otherwise though , you 're attacking a straw man . 
  they just want to stop the movement , not cause more trouble for themselves by causing civil war . 
  there is zero doubt that they forcibly replaced the editors of multiple news organizations , that nationalist mobs turned up at hdp offices . 
  or that they have supported or ignored terrorists . 
  if we want a better future we should fucking act like it . 
  but we do n't . 
  we allow corporations and revolving doors everywhere . 
  we do n't scrutinize the media and what it gives attention too . 
  would be good to know how these people have ties to the `` industries '' engaged in this stuff . 
  and of course the netherlands is * hardly * alone in this . 
  for one , i expect the eu will be detrimental , not beneficial if it is corrupt in this way . 
  ( and it largely is ), 
  2 % consumption increase ? 
  [ raising the minimum wage ] ( http://www.bna.com/germany-national-minimum-n17179892612/?_escaped_fragment_=# ! ), 
  related ? 
  ( edit : dumb that they do n't mention this , imo . ), 
  i would expect it . 
  is more effective at increasing ( actual ) economic activity than giving it to investors/capitalists etcetera . 
  ( though a combination is even better ) the latter is what quantative easing and bailouts do effectively , of course . 
  one advantage of the economic crisis was that it kept carbon in the ground . 
  i am ready for the corporate influence in the european commission to fuck off . 
  one thing you have to understand about the establishment is that it is not out to get a better world . 
  ( edit : at least : you can not count on it ) you can see from the lobbying and revolving doors that they 're interested in promoting their own interests and the interest of corporations . 
  they claim it is a-moral ( as opposed to im - ) drive , yet they constantly install ( neoliberal ) policies that produce such amoral behavior . 
  i know that the public is too complacent , but the blame on the soundbites is too easy . 
  some news sources have significant funding from government , ant that should be used to seek for informing the public , - not - seeking popularity . 
  they hang on to their official sources and the news wire way too closely . 
  the [ propaganda model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda_model ) indicates a lot of the causes . 
  ( it is not a conspiracy - \\ _ - ) that includes consolidation of media empires , which is essentially a deliberate act . 
  furthermore in media too , there are ( edit : not researched enough ... ) revolving doors too for instance , rona fairhead is be chairman of the bbc , and has a lot of connections to the financial industry . 
  stop hating on protests , sure some of them are doing it to feel good , many of them are trying . 
  also , some of those are not even environmental protests . 
  i find it quite insane that people would actually protest for coal , i suppose they swallowed the lies . 
  for instance pascoe sabido did plenty of research at [ corporate europe observatory ] ( http://corporateeurope.org/ ) , another participated in earlier cop19 talks and got kicked out , others are already being affected on low-lying islands , or by tar sand operations that `` created jobs '' , but most of the people come in from out side , narrow minded men bringing in crime . 
  others yet are about generally `` keep carbon in the ground '' . 
  most see coal as highest priority . 
  2 ) oil 3 ) gas , obviously shale oil/gas and tar sands are worse than the regular variety . 
  and if you worry about them not trusting science . 
  i mean , i am all for science , but lies have been thrust into this [ for a long-ass time ] ( http://insideclimatenews.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming ) . 
  seriously , trust is long dead , iraq war lies , financial industry failure and lack of consequences , extensive corruption via lobbying an revolving doors , abuse of terrorism to destroy civil rights , drugs in sport . 
  and we know the msm aint there to inform us . 
  and that is just the recent stuff . 
  people can not see through all the science and see that that is right , people dont know if they can trust you . 
  basically you have to start at the beginning . 
  yes it sucks . 
  worse , if you 're building one , some people are going to think , `` so what company are you with '' . 
  maybe people `` need '' pr companies , i think it starts with the [ dysfunctional media ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda_model ) . 
  it is in-effect not made to inform people . 
  education is not going to cut it , if people do n't have good sources in the first place . 
  i mean , you can hardly ask them to put all the raw evidence together . 
  journalism should make a stories out of correcting incorrect beliefs , and realize that they have some responsibility to their audience about what gets attention . 
  there have been plenty of actions , i hope it is not one that happens to be stupid that becomes popular to look at here . 
  fossil fuels that are actually poluting are protested against too . 
  besides , nuclear technology can be a way to try reduce co2 emissions , but i doubt it is something to put all eggs in . 
  ( unless we magically figure out super-effective fusion or something ) i also worry about the large per-unit costs of nuclear . 
  https://skepticalscience.com/co2-lags-temperature.htm apparently , precession makes the seasons align with the eliptical orbit , causing warmer summers , releasing co2 , causing more warming . 
  really , meh , i am not arguing with this . 
  climate scientists have consensus on this , co2 drives it up , and there is no reason to think that some other parameter will come to save the day . 
  it is hopeful thinking . 
  the difficulty with the models is largely where the co2 ends up . 
  the co2 * in air * versus celcius relation is better . 
  though albedo effects like from icecap melting and cloud cover affect it . 
  given that contrails and aerosols might have a downward impact , and temperature rise might cause wildfires/tundras/wars to produce more co2 , climate disaster might worsen itself . 
  co2 raises temperature as sure as the sky is blue . 
  co2 absorbs longer wavelength light as sure as nitrogen scatters blue light . 
  i am a complex system too , but i am warmer under a blanket . 
  [ it really has warmed ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/global_temperature_anomaly.svg/320px-global_temperature_anomaly.svg.png ) , weather patterns have really changed . 
  ( including droughts in california , syria ( co-causing the war ) , australia , sudan ) ice has really melted , the oceans are really [ acidifies ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/woa05_glodap_del_ph_ayool.png/300px-woa05_glodap_del_ph_ayool.png ) . 
  and [ exxon knew for over 30 years ] ( http://insideclimatenews.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming ) , they * all * know , and use the projections for seeing where business interests are going . 
  these companies do spend money , but just for seeding doubt . 
  stop believing the propaganda . 
  basically , all of it . 
  not like there have been particularly large amount of vulcanic activity or anything . 
  of course , wildfires and other co2 release are caused by the climate change itself , but i count that as human-caused , the proximate cause is only temperature rises . 
  ( besides humans set many of those fires ), 
  in no way i trust 100 % or anything . . 
  i said `` take seriously '' . 
  ( might have been a bit hyperbolic in implying others are not taken seriousl ) it helps that democracynow selected them for interview , and george monbiot ( writer ) and michael brune ( executive director of the sierra club ) are well known , and i 'll likely read/see more of them , adding to `` falsifiability '' . 
  michael brune is optimistic , in that , while he basically says that the agreement doesnt do near enough , he does think some critical progress about positions about co2 emissions and fossil fuels has been made . 
  george monbiot basically argues that these opinions might simply not have sticking power . 
  firstly , that there are few stories on cop21 on / r/europe , while it is certainly an important topic . 
  secondly corporate lobbying influence ( also via revolving doors ) is in many articles barely recognized , and i find that pretty ridiculous . 
  i mean * i * am being presumtuous . 
  unfortunately , climate articles do n't seem to stand a good chance here . 
  ( prove me wrong please ) today heard one [ somewhat positive voice ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2015/12/14/a_turning_point_for_the_climate ) on climate change i can take seriously ; i can take it seriously because he [ doesnt deny corporate corruption ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-brune/the-lights-of-paris_b_8714022.html ) . 
  i think this is `` opinion '' , not news . 
  unless you want people to do `` interviews '' and then have articles written for them , instead of writing articles themselves . 
  similarly , [ this is opinion too ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wre3n/many_iraqis_already_want_out_of_finland_im_dying/ ) , i mean 70 returners on 10k refugees ? 
  interviews do n't make things not-opinions . 
  i am asking if you checked the evidence . 
  i mean , all this sentiment , but few indicate more particular knowledge . 
  you 're lucky many here live in states with good justice systems , otherwise , you 'd cheer on a show trial too . 
  yeah , that is presumptuous , but as i said , i disdain the sentiment-posts . 
  did you check ? 
  disdain 100 % - sentiment pointless comments , despise the hateful ones , even if the persons involved did some nasty shit . 
  if they 're upvoted , at least . 
  i can well imagine people making them , but not that they 'd consistently upvote them , hiding actual informative/insightful stuff . 
  ( i think i earned my downvotes already , so i 'll leave it at that . ), 
   criminals will make their own and sell them across continents if there 's money to be made . 
  * because * it is much more expensive where they are banned .
