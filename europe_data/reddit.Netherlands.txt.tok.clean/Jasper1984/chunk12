  illegality makes it harder to get your hands on a gun , period . 
   by banning almost all guns , and making people pay 400 dollars for permits and 90 dollars for finger printing fees for just ownership ( forget carry ) , nyc has made precisely zero impact on the sale and trade ( the illegal sale and trade ) of firearms . 
  yeah , and it has open borders to the entirety of the us . 
  the gun issue is mainly worse since we opened borders with east block countries . 
  i am sure that is what this law is aimed at . 
  [ quick look ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overview_of_gun_laws_by_nation#european_union ) , they pretty soon saw the need for a minimum . 
  yes , according to another post , the protesting party apparently did the same . 
  see also / u / _ marcoos [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wiegs/march_in_defence_of_democracy_livestream_from/cxwgz82 ) ... 
  i do n't like the vote-by-opinion stuff . 
  well i see claims of unconstitutional acts , this is the claim to counter , if dismissiveness is the complete response , that suggests that the claims are true . 
  seems overly optimistic . 
  compare attitudes to eulas , attitude of the nsa , existence of leaks . . and it 'd make it technically possible , even if it is legally not allowed . 
   here 's a quick scenario : cheaper insurance if you allow to be tracked so that the insurance company knows you do n't overspeed . 
  but it could also look where your car is parked . 
  if that is risky . 
  if the insurance is for healthcare , that might also be problematic . 
  i mean in the netherlands , insurers may not discriminate , but their algorithms might . 
  i mean , there is even one named `` promovendum '' , apparently to scare lower-income people away . 
  these people have more health care costs . 
  and if you just look at the position data , you 'll see that people in richer neighbourhood will have less health care costs too . 
  will turkey allow the free press to do its job ? 
  will it allow democratic/civic alternatives like hdp to operate ? 
  or will it keep creating an atmosphere of fear like last elections ? 
  i mean , i do n't know the situation that well . 
  but i am not going to shut up when i think it is just a population resisting repression . 
  even if it is sometimes violent . 
  and i also disdain the claim that suddenly * all * members of that group are terrorists . 
  it is plainly a designation of hate . 
  yeah , if this thing works , we 'll need to make a larger version , and then it still * also * has to work pelted by neutrons , * and * then still the power/euro ratio is in question . 
  there is literally only [ one other ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3w7kfu/ban_petrol_diesel_cars_by_2050_european/ ) environment-related story in two pages or / r/europe , and it has been simular throughout the cop21 . 
  it seems like climate is not really getting enough attention . 
  but `` new shiny tech '' easily gets attention . 
  this is problematic , because the tech basically is n't a solution most of the time , those developping it have an incentive to exaggerate , and corporations even push for some false solutions for its own sake . 
  ( so they can keep emitting , pwomising fixes in the future ) they 're also impressed by china and india 's rise , and the small drop - in recession - in the eu/us . 
  we totally need more than this drop in co2 production . 
  quite frankly , i worry about compounding factors like forest ( peat ) fires or methane that permafrost can produce . 
  i know , they all sound like doomsayers , `` they want it psychologically '' . 
  maybe . 
  but corporations [ go ] ( http://insideclimatenews.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming ) far [ too ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/3w39h2/exposed_academicsforhire_agree_not_to_disclose/ ) . 
  quite frankly , we can expect problems , and because the likelyhood of droughts in africa and potentially resulting terrorism and refugee streams . 
  well , i worry for our humanity . 
  it is not for simply having a positive opinion of isis ;  the charges included [ 1 ] `` belonging to a terrorist organization , '' [ 2 ] recruiting youngsters to join the `` islamic state , '' [ 3 ] inciting others to commit acts of terrorism , and [ 4 ] participating in military training in syria . 
  her face , it is mary robson , the lips move and words come out . 
  it is an interview , you know . 
  7th president of ireland , united nations high commissioner for human rights , one of [ `` the elders '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_elders_\\ ( organization \\ ) ) . 
  as for climate change and its effects , do i have to explain that whole thing to you ? 
  can you not find it out yourself ? 
  you know , this global warming problem is pretty damn old . 
  [ mary robinson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mary_robinson ) . 
  [ pt2 ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2015/12/10/cop21_treaty_draft_excludes_gender_equality ) , [ pt3 ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2015/12/10/fmr_irish_pres_on_refugees_its ), 
   if you want peace , prepare for war perhaps valid criticism of some of his policies . 
  though if you look at wwi , the arms race only helped make it happen , and you can wonder if [ the defense industry is that great ] ( https://theintercept.com/2015/12/04/defense-contractors-cite-benefits-of-escalating-conflicts-in-the-middle-east/ ) . 
  or you can wonder if something like mad has any longevity , considering the constant risk that it causes . 
  but also , bombing syria is more like `` do war '' than `` prepare for war '' , and it is hardly discussed at all if the strategy there is effective at all . 
  well it assumes an open market , it assumes never ending growth . 
  we 're pretty much the richest per capita . 
  if we 're to keep the same ratio in wealth level , environment is not going to take that in the first place . 
  the whole attitude f \\* cks up the planet . 
  we 're the wealthiest now , we put in the historic co2 , we should lead in keeping carbon in the ground . 
  and maybe even putting co2 back in , but none of these technologies in the foreseeable future are going to make much of a dent . 
  pushed out there as false climate solution campaigns . 
  edit : business [ loves it ] ( http://corporateeurope.org/fi/node/1483 ) of course , they can yell `` give us stuff , drop regulations , we need to be competitive ! '', 
  yeah , we have to be competitive , also after we fuck up the world . 
  or we can like , just give the right example and push for the others to do so . 
  you know , live your values , instead of being a bunch of rats . 
  it doesnt take much to see that afghanistan is basically a lawless , despite using bombing * and * people on the ground * and * local contacts . 
  obama had to reneg on leaving . 
  similar for iraq , though i think things might be a little better there . 
  however , isis did obviously basically overrun places there , though the ground was overrun . 
  of course isis is a `` state '' , but relying on that . . 
  it is basically crossing your fingers . 
  it does n't take much to see that this shit does not work . 
  and people saying that you 're saying ... well , my other comment is accurate . 
  people like / u/sunlightbear swallow the `` look enemies there ! '', 
  bait , hook , line and sinker . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  well , ultimately , going to play out over-the-decades , but i think if we imagine the potential consequences it is hard to stumach the consequences of doing nothing . 
  i mean even if we 'd fail we should try do stuff about it . 
  one main thing in my head is , educating about the consequences of that propaganda model . 
  it is one big bit in making alternative worldviews more palletable ; it answers why people do n't know about it already . 
  it simultaniously in-effect demands for people to find good sources of information . 
  basically , what is different from what we 've been doing in iraq and afghanistan for over a decade ? 
  note : [ the first four sections are jeremy corbin ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2015/12/8/ ) . 
  well , the us has * been * that bigger invader nation multiple times , so it is a little hypocritical in the first place . 
  also , well , saudi arabia is a long-time ally . 
  maybe all hindsight . 
  if [ this speech by president carter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcod-qwzb_g&amp;spfreload=10 ) was better received , maybe we would n't have been in this mess . 
  it is all baked in the assumptions of how things work . 
  as i said , basically , the things the media we see gives attention to ( there may be low-attention articles ) paints the world view . 
  so you need to find good journalistic sources . 
  and those necessarily need to avoid the pitfalls msm media fall in . 
  i find [ democracynow ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/ ) good . 
  telesur probably good to try , have n't seen much from there , neither are european-based , though . 
  otherwise , stop the machine from rolling , fix revolving doors , lobbying and overt corporate influence , denounce the use of military power for economic or political gain . 
  it has been suggested to liken the fossil fuel industry influence to to the tobacco influence in who , and they threw them out entirely . 
  divest from fossil fuel , heavily invest in green energy and energy savings . 
  natural gas is the least worst , so perhaps use that as a transition . . 
  though i heard that fracking , * next * to the toxicity , also leaks methane , potentially making that natural gas awful co2/j again . 
  make sure that developping countries skip fossil fuel infrastructure entirely . 
  recognize that we can not grow our economy and fit the constraints .
