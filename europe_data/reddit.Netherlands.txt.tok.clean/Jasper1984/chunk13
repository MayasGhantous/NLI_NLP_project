  we need to eat less meat and not fly/drive around as much . 
  but also recognize that we can still grow socially if we connect our societies together better , and fight economic inequality . 
  fighting it also might free up money for more jobs . 
  we might need to recognize , sometimes something should take more labour to saver energy . 
  something like ets can kindah represent that , but if you look at the history of carbon credits , it does n't look very good . 
  recognize past wrongdoing . 
  starting with the worse offenders , send people to the international court . 
  at least send bloody kissinger there . 
  i am actually not sure about how to deal with isis . 
  should be very careful bombing . 
  but there is a lot to do on the sides , preventing trade-in-and-out when it might help isis . 
  look at where the weapons and drugs are coming from . 
  try get civilians out from the area . 
  i can hardly be complete , or entirely right with this size of topic . 
  [ found this ] ( http://www.alternativetrademandate.org/ ) on on [corporateeurope.org ] ( http://corporateeurope.org/ ) though . 
  yeah , but it is also not like they 're that active causing trouble in other countries , and there is this deal to stop nuclear proliferation . 
  the deal is a whole story on itself , but . . it does go as far as allowing inspectors not only to facilities , but also uranium mines , etcetera . 
  yeah , maybe you should get angry at saudi arabia first . 
  they give out a lot more lashes , do more beheadings , and making your government stop supporting them will hurt saudis much more than anything we can reasonably do against iran . 
  also , it is kindah understandable that they 'd want nuclear weapons , considering the us has the habit of invading countries there , and supported iraq in its attacks . 
  edit : to be clear , i mean the [ iraq-iran war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran%e2%80%93iraq_war ), 
  the facts are also anti-establishment . 
  for instance , most of the refugees are from conflicts we caused . 
  in the case of syria , the iraq and afghanistan war , and the mujahideen versus the ussr . 
  the saudis and turkish we support have supported , or failed to fight isis and other groups for a long ass time , and probably still are . 
  we support the saudis despite this , their human right violations , opposition to our values . 
  cnn give them and similar states nice spots , lots of media do n't report as heavily on them , like in the case of the yemen war . 
  ( [ largely how this happens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda_model ) , relevant throughout ) furthermore , the bombing we do right now will not be any more effective than those that we did in the past . 
  why are we killing people , many of which innocent , if it does not serve any purpose \\* . 
  syria also had a terrible draught before the civil war . 
  that gets us to climate change . 
  [ 30 ] ( http://insideclimatenews.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming ) - year [ corporate ] ( http://corporateeurope.org/ ) liars allowed in cop21 , it is a trueism that little will be achieved there , by those inside the summit , at least . 
  these people are allowed to peddle their false solutions . 
  like ccs `` sure we 'll put it back into the ground '' . 
  it is much easier and cheaper to keep * coal * in the ground . 
  the eu * alleged * goal is for europe have more power in the world , but what the fuck are we using it for . 
  neoliberalism is about removal of these powers . 
  and removal of regulations like those of co2 emissions . 
  i could also mention how shitty the financial system is , and a lot of historical and more recent meddling . 
  or ukraine ... well russia kindah sucks , but from what i read , we did n't do diplomacy very well either . 
  or you can mention , you know , nsa spying . 
  and i can also shit on ourselves . 
  people are n't that fucking know the truth , they do n't have `` propaganda model '' in their head watching tv . 
  they are `` tired '' coming home , mindlessly flick that shit-thing on . 
  they accept the win10 eula . 
  they do n't support independent journalism . 
  extremism and racism both do n't accept the lies . 
  unfortunately they replace them with their own lies . 
  the movements are there to replace the status-quo with another one , and supplant the lies aswel . 
  understanding the propaganda model , and listening to actual independent media , that seeks the truth as far as they can see it , that is the solution . 
  ( not `` objective '' or `` neutral '' media ), 
  note that part of the point of the book [ manufacturing consent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manufacturing_consent ) is that there is a illusion of a full debate out there , but really anything out of a particular range of opinions is marginalized . 
  that 's how you get all those interventions the us did , with relatively little backlash in the us itself . 
  of course the book is from 1988 , the internet probably broke the system a bit , but it looks like it may be bouncing back . . well no blog is simultaniously that all-round and actually good . 
  the `` blog '' approach is rather limited and not `` professional '' enough to do that i think . 
  ( professional has so many connotations , and i mean a few ... ) i find [ democracynow ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/ ) , [ truth-out ] ( http://truth-out.org/ ) , [ truthdig ] ( http://www.truthdig.com/ ) good myself . 
  guardian is pretty good too . 
  [ telesur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telesur ) might be good . 
  ( but have just seen a little bit of them ) actually for europe-specific i do n't know too many that aim at regular news . 
  ( and simultaniously aim at independence like that , obviously ) been following [ corporate europe observatory ] ( http://corporateeurope.org/ ) . 
  ( but their texts arent very good for general-public consumption . . ), 
  putting it on the back pages is not giving it attention . 
  noam chomsky had to repeatedly say that about his [ propaganda model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda_model ) . 
  and then we get to our own corruption in fifa .

  i 'd paint a bigger picture , but it is pointless . 
  you do n't like me telling you that the msm keeps this , and for instance the war in yemen quiet . 
  was he actually involved with that aswel ? 
  edit : dunno , seems like guilt by association to me . 
  point taken , i should have looked before that . 
   joke apart ; you 're not looking for a serious answer but for a reason to complain i am pissed off . 
  for various reasons , i should be pissed . 
  off . 
  [ take it you 're referring to this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3uu160/france_places_climate_activists_under_house/cxhwdkh ) , dunno what to say . . [ here is a recent interview with jos\u00e9 bov\u00e9 ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2015/11/30/french_farmer_activist_jose_bove_on ) . 
  yeah , actually the real question is if an attack is realistic . 
  how do you know they stopped a dozen attacks ? 
  `` oh it is super secret '' is not actually a very satisfactory answer . 
  edit : . . to be honest , the fact that they allowed the christmas markets at champs elys\u00e9es and soccer matches to continue ( despite the latter being attacked before ) but not cop21 protests , says it all . 
  unless you believe they simultaniously know enough to know there would be attacks on the protests , but not enough to actually capture anyone . 
  similarly you claim `` they stopped a dozen attacks '' * yet * there are zero stories of people being arrested or killed in said prevention . 
  in which case , you * just dont know * there is an actual risk being stopped , i.e. 
  you should stop the state of emergency . 
  your message is `` yes this guy helps plunder abroad , but we have to listen to him '' . 
  and that is what sums up cop21 too . 
  pretend to do something about it , and `` universal responsibility '' , when * our * countries are the ones pumping most of the co2 into the atmosphere . 
  and then just use our power , guns and nuclear bombs to keep our end of the world the way we like it . 
  but then i guess i can hardly convince you that that is even a remote possibility . 
  media rants on about these topics , cop21 ? 
  not very prominent in the media at all . 
  the media just selects what it wants us to see , [ via these mechanisms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda_model ) , plus a bit of revolving doors , and complacency . 
  [ gay marriage .

  you can also look at what they allowed and what they did n't .

  the christmas markets as champs elys\u00e9es will still go on , and even the football games will continue ( !!?! ), 
  where the terrorists were trying to get in !, 
  but no , no climate protests . 
  next up we 're going to take the term `` axis of evil '' seriously . 
  the state basically has been given the right to raid and house-arrest people with fairly little oversight . 
   [ french interior minister bernard cazeneuve announced wednesday that authorities had carried out more than 2,200 raids since a state of emergency was declared following the november 13 attacks that killed 130 people .
