  under the state of emergency , french police can raid any home without judicial oversight . 
  in addition , police have held 263 people for questioning -- nearly all have been detained . 
  another 330 people are under house arrest , and three mosques have also been shut down . 
  the vast majority of those targeted in the raids have been muslim . 
  we speak with yasser louati , spokesperson and head of the international relations desk for the collective against islamophobia in france . 
  ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2015/12/3/state_of_emergency_in_france_2 ) however , i do n't know in how many cases they actually found something noteworthy . 
  minor criminal offenses , and drugs do not necessarily equate to terrorism , obviously . 
  a concern is that normal people are pissed off when it happens to them . 
  yeah , lets listen to this guy , not like he simultaniously [ has diplomatic ties in the region ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tony_blair#post-premiership_.282007.e2.80.93present.29 ) , and has financial ties to the oil industry . 
  including :  blair 's links with , and receipt of an undisclosed sum from , [ ui energy corporation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ui_energy_corporation ) , have also been subject to media comment in the uk . 
  where ui energy corporation  it is part of international consortium for development of prospects in iraqi kurdistan . 
  it claims that its network of advisors gives it a strong competitive edge over other companies . 
  yeah `` advisors '' . 
  nothing to do with swaying policies . 
  ( also ... right next to syria . . ) oh , he is also godfather to rupert murdoch 's daughter . 
  ca n't do stuff without some [ manufacturing consent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manufacturing_consent ) . 
   it 'll probably last for the duration of the syrian/iraqi civil war to be honest . 
  that is , you know , abroad , in another country . 
  also it is likely going to last for many years , it is not at all clear that there is that big a risk . 
  more traffic deaths since the attack in france already ... 
  i clearly said one aspect . 
  and the article clearly talks about a particular mentality , and you clearly did not get it . 
  wow , superspecific . 
  why am * i * supposed to give a name to it . 
  edit : i suppose it is alright to make that many assumptions about the people you 're talking too . . 
  well i dont care because i basically already know there is going to shit in it . 
  democracy should not be about washing out all the shit out from proposals created in secret by non-representatives . 
  corporate influence on decision making is * very * evident , and well documented . 
  [ also in the eu ] ( http://corporateeurope.org/ ) . 
  you basically have to been living under a rock to not know so . 
  ( but the msm will also do ) also , the tpp also showed itself to be terrible . 
  btw , i hardly trust reddit . 
  all sorts of stories get nuancing statements fairly quickly , but not this one ? 
  furthermore , `` conspiracy theorist '' is * fucking just namecalling * . 
  so ... irrational fear , cowardly put above ideals . 
  you know , more people have died in traffic accidents in france since the paris attacks than in the attacks themselves . 
  that is * exactly * what we 're freaking out about . 
  edit : [ one aspect of why it is bad ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/02/free-speech-twitter-france ), 
  presumably the states of emergency are allowed by the constitution . 
  presumbably they can they judge the legitimacy of states of emergency ? 
  if so , i 'd expect that the law stipulates there having the be reasons for calling them ... 
  name calling is an action too , yet you feel the need to defend yourself against the idea that you 're doing that . 
  my point is that calling something grandstanding can be name-calling . 
  yeah , but i do n't call people not-supporting it names for it . 
  edit : it is * the point * that they stress their opinion , it is * the point * that they present arguments , * also * those that might help their popularity , when people think they are right . 
  the concept of `` grandstanding '' only has a role when the arguments are vacuous or something . 
  otherwise , it is simply an anti-democratic term . 
  [ democracynow ran a story on state-of-emergency raids . 
  ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2015/12/3/state_of_emergency_in_france_2 ) ( seems mainly from the raided-end ), 
  you mean that they 'll express their opinion about it , and it will be negative . 
  because you dont like it you call it `` grandstanding '' . 
  edit : right , i 'll add that to the list of insults you can do without any reason , conspiracy theorist would be another . 
  add `` in a secure reading room '' , mods ? 
  nevertheless an improvement . 
  i want it entirely public before going to votes too . 
  also , i am against it in any case , because it started as corporate/elites wishlish . 
  we totally havent been doing that at all so far !, 
  and , that will totally require putting them in jail for 1.5 years !, 
  hint : 1 ) yes we have , 2 ) no it does n't and it is wildly injust 3 ) ~ ~ you are an idiot . ~ ~ ( okey pissy mood ), 
   have you seen the suspect pulling the trigger ? 
  i must admit , i feel a lot of evidence is there , but nothing that connects all the dots . 
  but if that was the standard for trials , barely anyone would ever get sentenced . 
  it does n't matter , why are there these numbers of trucks going in and out there ? 
  what is actually in them ? 
  when it was russia and much smaller areas of ukraine , it was important and now it is not ?!, 
  well , just on nos ( dutch public news ) they basically did include putins threat , you 'd say these accusations would be mentioned too . 
  but they 're not getting that much treatment . 
  it is extremely noteworthy . 
  edit : * and * marked as opinion , yet people come in and say it is `` obvious '' , lol !, 
  noteworthy also * not one * cop21 story on / r/europe right now , really , it is * incredible * . 
  that does n't implement what i said , and elected officials * can * do wrong . 
  [ etat d'urgence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/states_of_emergency_in_france#statute_provisions_-_.c3.89tat_d.27urgence ) , looks to me like it can do a lot . 
  ( what the fuck does `` obsolete '' mean ... ) 2 . 
  for one there were plenty of peaceful protesters and [ at least one monument was desecrated by the police ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2015/11/30/thousands_defy_paris_state_of_emergency ) , and according to the report , the police reported it as-by-activists too . 
  ( so you might have just regurgitated propaganda ) also , clearly some of them are having problems . 
  i am not actually sure about the nature . . of the protesters . 
  really these police clashes have rarely been associated with anything like the terrorism that is feared . 
  i asked someone , wearechange.org was down in france , up for me . 
  ( tried proxies to check myself too , but they all sucked ) 4 . 
  your data will * often * cross nsa and `` five eyes '' international fiberoptic taps . 
  i expect they cover 99 % of your traffic , and you infact have zero legal protections because you 're not a citizen to the tappers . 
  furthermore , [ on the us end , they * did * abuse the paris attack ] ( https://theintercept.com/2015/11/15/exploiting-emotions-about-paris-to-blame-snowden-distract-from-actual-culprits-who-empowered-isis/ ) . 
  i suppose it 'd be handy if i actually knew more on france 's situation . 
  edit : [ farago , french women rights minister , quoted , directly supporting censorship on the internet ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/02/free-speech-twitter-france ) . 
  edit : from [ this article ] ( https://theintercept.com/2015/01/09/solidarity-charlie-hebdo-cartoons/ ) :  to see how true that is , consider the fact that charlie hebdo -- the `` equal opportunity '' offenders and defenders of all types of offensive speech -- [ fired ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/4351672/french-cartoonist-sine-on-trial-on-charges-of-anti-semitism-over-sarkozy-jibe.html ) one of their writers in 2009 for writing a sentence some said was anti-semitic ( the writer was then charged with a hate crime offense , and [ won a judgment ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/actualite-medias/article/2010/12/10/charlie-hebdo-condamne-pour-le-licenciement-abusif-de-sine_1451578_3236.html ) against the magazine for unfair termination ) . 
  does that sound like `` equal opportunity '' offending ? 
  we literally know of only one terrorist running around . 
  and otherwise , so fucking what . 
  if that is all it takes to stop doing `` libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 '' , risking a few dead , you never believed in anyway . 
  it would basically be an ... anxiety-state , a fear-state . 
  see 58 road deaths/year/million people 67m people , 3.9 k/year or 10 a day , and it is like 20 days ago , so literally , we can expect more deaths on the road than by the terror attack by now . 
  terrorist-scared people , sirs , you are retards . 
  ( and this is coming from someone who is scared . 
  of state power , of corporate power , of international tensions , of climate change , of resources running out . ), 
  ( note : [ dumb table does not show if per-year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/road_traffic_safety ) , seems to be per-year ), 
  estonia is in the eu , and so might end up signing ttip . 
  edit : for all those naysayers , yes , this actually risks sovereignty . 
  yeah , if they understood they wouldnt have fucking allowed three months of it . 
  * they have decided to have a * 3 months * state of emergency . 
  which is * totally insane * infact , they shouldnt even have used all the 12 days after which they needed parliament .
