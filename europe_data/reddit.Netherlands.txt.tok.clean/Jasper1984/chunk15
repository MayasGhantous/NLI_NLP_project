  they * should * have passed a law some limited ( like , absolute number ) extra ability to do house searches so they can find these people . 
  ( like , one or two a day , and some openness about them , after them ) * they have banned climate protests at cop21 , there is * absolutely no * indication that the activists are targets or that they themselves pose any threat . 
  also heard about other activities involving crowds were allowed . 
  * ( less certain ) it seems like they 're going after `` conspiracy theorists '' . 
  at least wearechange.org is down . 
  reading the definition of hollandes party of `` conspiracy theorist '' , it is dangerously widely defined . 
  again and again , when terrorism happens , * civil liberties and privacy are attacked * . 
  snowden didnt reveal that they spied on terrorists . 
  he revealed that they spy on * everyone * . 
  this shit is n't for us . 
  see links [ in my other post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3v5149/russia_turkeys_erdo%c4%9fan_tied_to_is_oil_trade/cxl3thu ) . 
  i much doubt they are lying on this one . 
  and turkey is heading towards being a dictatorship , sorry to say . 
  [ russia provides detailed information here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/3v576a/russian_military_reveals_new_details_of_isis/ ) , though i have not checked up to them . 
  [ at least two reporters have been killed recently ] ( http://theantimedia.org/1-journalist-dead-3-more-arrested-after-exposing-turkey-arming-syrian-extremists/ ) note that presstv is iranian ( aledgedly independent . 
  i take that is on the level of cnn or rt ) . 
  there is [ lots of evidence ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-l-phillips/research-paper-isis-turke_b_6128950.html ) of informal allegiance with isis . 
  ( [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/18/turkey-cut-islamic-state-supply-lines-erdogan-isis ) ) ( edit : [ this guardian article is good too ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/26/isis-syria-turkey-us?cmp=share_btn_tw ) ) still a bit missing is an article making sense of it , but i am pretty much convinced to be frank . 
  ( yes , our establishments are shit ), 
  [ :\\ ( ] ( http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/33501-why-the-paris-climate-summit-will-be-a-peace-conference ) . . maybe a hint about [ what this opinion actually means ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t3wb2/europe_must_learn_from_israel/ ) . 
  did not realize the news had to be new . 
  and it doesnt make sense to censor it for that reason , because the story itself spans more than a decade . 
  as far as i am concerned , all this does is make the media-savvy more effective . 
   never mind `` post-modernity '' well . . there has to be a delicous , absolutely delectable rant about our `` post modern '' democracies and media in there . 
  i hope someone minds !, 
  it also says 10 warnings in 5 ~ ~ seconds ~ ~ minutes , and mentions 6 dates at which letters were sent about this topic . 
  the pkk was a terrorist organization in the past , but was on a peaceful track for a long time . 
  this pattern was broken * by turkey * , when the current people in power were threatened by future elections . 
  turkey has basically attacked political parties , and created an atmosphere of fear in the last election . 
  [ here is a list ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-l-phillips/research-paper-isis-turke_b_6128950.html ) of evidence that turkey is working with isis , but afaik ( i have not looked far yet ) nothing that is definitive . 
  [ here is a list ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-l-phillips/research-paper-isis-turke_b_6128950.html ) , i am not sure yet , but it is starting to look like it . . 
  i should always know their motivations , and me not knowing them makes me wrong . 
  http://www.democracynow.org/shows/2015/11/20 , you cant get your mind changed by discussion . 
  follow non-propaganda . 
  the thing i hate most is the hating . 
  this is a small chunk what * we * do and what * we * are complicit in , transported here . 
  separate yourself from the dependent media , or you will be complicit too . 
  intolerance gets them recruits . 
  probably `` wanting to be a state '' might motivate them too . 
  certainly , they didnt do it to get the west to stop bombing them . 
  is goal is to destroy the gray area of between terrorism and muslims in general . 
  plenty of europeans are doing a splendid job helping them out . 
  meanwhile the media transmits it all uncritically , and not seeking their own sources much . 
  some media blatantly lie , even . 
  they allow people do drag in the topic of `` poor against the rich '' , and suggest we take the same approach to the world as israel have . 
  meanwhile they barely mention the jemen war , dont question anything about the hospital ( \\* [ the kunduz one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kunduz_hospital_airstrike ) ) fired at for 30 minutes after reported ( and clearly indicated in multiple ways ) barely mention the honduras coup . 
  barely use the information good sources like the intercept produces . 
  suggest you see http://www.democracynow.org/shows/2015/11/19 edit : btw ayaan makes some good points . 
  i am not sure if we really can not deal with the refugees , i still think we can . 
  israel was always a colonizer state , of course , that may be the matter-a-fact condition , nevertheless , we should [ bds ] ( http://www.bdsmovement.net/ ) for how they act * now * , and * not * act like them . 
  basically what i meant , however , not necessarily higher-end jobs like `` consultant '' implies . 
  however , in some cases , they do it for postal workers , home-to-home-nurses , and cleaners aswel . 
  well , i can not judge that , but if she is writing this stuff , she 's gone way off the track . 
  i like [ amy goodman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amy_goodman ) better . 
  how do `` paperwork tricks '' like `` having a company so you can park your car closer '' , or one-man-businesses that obscure employeeship ? 
  not entirely clear what we 're seeing here . . 
  maybe it is an opinion , but it certainly is * not * `` just '' an opinion , it references plenty . 
  i suggest you take it seriously . 
  i do n't think it is a bad thing . 
  but it will make europeans more guilty for what happens . 
  ( for instance [ on climate change ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3sgaqu/big_fossilenergys_has_more_access_to_europes/ ) ), 
  also according to it , ca\u00f1ete was president to petrologis and petroleos ducar , and has a dubious record as environment minister in spain . 
  but that 'd make it titlegory . 
  it 'd be handy to know how many other parties were there on average , for different parties . 
  ( i.e. 
  a meeting gives less influence if lots of other people are there too ) edit : shit timing of submission i think ... 
  most people watching/reading it are anything but anonymous . 
  you can get out of the media , pick your sources better . 
  and there are political parties to vote on , that roughly fit the idea of open source government . 
  most people do n't really , getting people out of the media that misinforms or fails to inform them is probably the most important goal . 
  i do n't think people are for open source government . 
  ( i do n't believe in centrally planned economies either , except for some controllable things like electricity , maybe ), 
  well , [ this submission ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qrmiy/the_revolving_doors_spin_again_corporate_europe/ ) didnt make much headway either . 
  and that is just informing yourself , not fighting . 
  lack of fighters is due to lack of people informing themselves and organizing themselves . 
  even reading reddit is too passive , if you ask me , nevermind the dubious nature of the voting system . 
  edit : btw , in dutch tv , the guy that reported on this came to a show about joining the reserve ( army ) . 
  i 'd hate fighting the russians , what the hell are we fighting * for * ? 
  what * the fuck * are we even doing in syria . 
  ca n't sell `` supporting moderate rebels '' as taking a stance against russia or the syrian govt , it is a stance * for * idiocy . 
  their rebel group is fictional , they even tried making one from scratch , spent many millions , ended up with ... 5 people . 
  i am not fighting for that shit . 
  i hope that they 're finally going for a deal . 
  bernie sanders indeed has not aligned himself against drone strikes , for instance . 
  i think you might be asking for too much . 
  [ as noam chomsky said  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/3qtawm/noam_chomsky_abby_martin_electing_the_president/ ) ( t +23 m :40 s )  abby martin : what do you think we should be focussing our energy on ? 
   noam chomsky : take for instance the bernie sanders campaign , which i think is important , impressive , he is doing good and courageous things , he is organizing a lot of people . 
  that campaign aught to be directed to sustaining a popular movement that uses the election as an kind-of-a incentive , but then go on . 
   but unfortunately it is not , when the election is over , the movement is going to die . 
  and that is a serious error , the only thing that is going to ever bring about any meaningful change is ongoing , dedicated popular movements which dont pay attention to the election cycles . 
   it is an extravaganza every four years , you have be involved in it , so fine , we 'll be involved in it , but then we go on . 
  if that were done , you 'd get mayor changes . 
  we , ( and americans in this case ) are going to have to be a-apatheists . 
  or maybe ahatheists . 
  [ in a link from there ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/turkey-heads-in-the-wrong-direction-and-europe-helps-it-on-the-way-a6718131.html ) ( independent.co.uk . .  the eu 's role in the whole business is entirely shameful . 
  in an attempt to appease erdogan , the publication of a critical progress report on turkey has been delayed by the eu commission until after the elections , and a fortnight before the elections germany 's chancellor , angela merkel , paid a visit to turkey , which was seen as tacit support for erdogan 's regime . 
   in an attempt to stem the flood of refugees heading for europe , the eu has offered a number of incentives to turkey : $ 3 billion in aid , the restart of membership talks , visa-free travel to the schengen area from 2016 , and an invitation to turkish leaders to eu summits . 
  true to style , turkey has just upped the ante to $ 3 billion a year in what an eu source calls erdogan 's `` protection racket '' . 
  it will be interesting to see whether the eu is hard pressed enough to fall for it . 
  i am absolutely stumped how this could possibly end up at zero points .
