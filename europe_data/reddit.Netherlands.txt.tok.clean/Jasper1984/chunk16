  maybe it needs summarizing . . 
  it 'd be quite depressing if the reason is that people do n't see the continuously increasing power of corporations , or how that worked out on the other side of the atlantic ... 
  [ backup link ] ( https://archive.is/nncmn ), 
  the people in the pkk are still largely kurds . 
  you 're right , that article does not fit in the rest of what `` my current idea '' of the state of affairs . . 
  which , btw , didnt include turkey supporting isis , but does include the `` current moderate rebels '' being relatively insignificant . . ( so supporting them is dubious ) i dont care for calling it `` circlejerk '' though . 
  anyway , i still think that turkey is basically cutting off with violence what could have been a peaceful process to the position of kurds in turkey , because erdogan and friends feel threatened about the potential kurdish state forming . 
   `` the pyd is committing ethnic cleansing here ( of ) arabs and turkmen , '' erdogan said . 
  `` if the kurds withdraw and do n't form a canton , there 's no problem . 
  but if the mindset continues , then what is necessary will be done or we face serious problems . 
  strange how he mentions a particular form of organization and ethnic cleansing so close to each other . 
  doesnt seem like those are related . 
  i dont really believe that they 're doing ethnic cleansing either . 
  nor would that absolve the turkish from anything , it seems [ they have been attacking the offices of the hdp ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2015/9/11/military_curfews_firebombings_airstrikes_shattered_peace ) since they won some seats in parliament . 
  it looks to me like there was a process of peaceful change was going on in turkey , and the turkish government selfishly is trying to destroy it . 
  i hope the eu will be wise in how to deal with turkey ... 
  unfortunately , i doubt it will be . 
  pkk is essentially kurds , and the main fighting force against isis according to many sources . 
  the focus on pesh merga seems to make sense considering the pkk is designated terrorist group by the us , and no doubt they could foretell the issue here . 
  not that it matters that they were a terrorist group before , because there was a sort-of slow peace process going , which erdogans status quo has now broken . 
  i have the source code of tox , i can compile it , send it to a friend . 
  both run it . 
  no companies involved . 
  the only way to guarantee communications can be listened to is to infringe on peoples ' computing . 
  next up , your analog hole . 
  if the computers are not backdoored and do n't have security flaws , and use unbroken crypto , a warrant does not give law enforcement any access . 
  so access would not at all be guaranteed to be available . 
  so if they should , some kind of broken-ness has to occur . 
  denying access is the amateur part of suppressing that story , of course , [ manufacturing consent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manufacturing_consent ) can work much better than that . 
  the `` joke '' \\* of course is that book explains how it helped the us support murderous regimes , and claimed the media was biased the opposite way it actually was . 
  no it should n't work that way . 
  it presupposes that the government controls what runs on every computer everywhere . 
  the linux master race will get very angry . 
  not as idiotic and childish as it should be . 
  [ for instance article ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/uk-police-investigating-five-alleged-pedophile-rings-involving-highly-influential-politicians ) ... 
  it is quite evident that the establishment shielded them . 
  edit : unfortunately is not out of the question that large portions of power hang together from a web of blackmail . . 
  in the us , the dennis hastert case could be something to try figure out . 
  similar for criminals , revolving doors with financial industry . 
  even terrorism is not out of the question . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manufacturing_consent ) is why you dont know . . really that is the main issue with / u/zoemayacastillo 's comment , it isnt convincing . 
  ( memory does not serve , so that vice.com link is a bit arbitrarily chosen . ), 
  700 $ x12x20 = 168k $ what can you build/maintain for 20 years with that ? 
  someone costing 30 $ / hour working 8 ^ \\* hours/day can work for 700 days for that . . to put it in perspective . 
  quite frankly , i expect that what you get for those 700 $ it is entirely possible to build stuff . 
  ( which is the obvious , this is not the middle ages , building stuff is cheaper compared to labour costs ) i think the rules prevent this , and builders fishing for more profit prevents it . 
  i hate that our own problems are now the problems of refugees . 
  at least we 'll get punished for it by higher crime rates , lol . 
  yeah , but then you 're a bleeding heart liberal perpetual whinypants complainer !, 
  just weigh it by gdp + population !, 
  just kidding of course , if gdp i euros that 'd boil down to just gdp , point is even with the simple approach a factor be needed . 
  should probably have gone for png . 
  ( it is non-lossy , the texts would look better ), 
  that might well be true , but it is nutty . 
  especially that many sundays they are open , actually in the netherlands , every sunday in some places . . 
  i do think it is a good idea to have mandatory down time , so smaller shops are at a more level playing field . . ( or just to slow stuff down a bit ) but the opening times should make sense . . 
  if you count the euro as expansion , that was definitely a failure . 
  at best too early , and at worst , a bad idea in any case . 
   i 'm not gon na talk much about / r/atheism , except to say that it 's mostly a humor subreddit . 
  you might not like their jokes , but the subreddit is n't really meant to be taken seriously . 
  it used to be different . 
  maybe it is a ` humor ' subreddit , but one that religiously follows atheism . 
  i 'd rather call it an ` ego-stroking subreddit ' , with ego-stroking often comes picking a population group ( mostly abrahmic religions in this case ) to put down to put yourself up . 
  it is quite lame . 
  i have the habit of downvoting every post that is a variant of ` this is bad ' . 
  however , in the linked thread , it does n't seem so popular to circlejerk . 
  but how it looks does depend on how you sort the list . 
  firstly people have the right to express themselves , but also the right to ( not ) listen . 
  ( though they kindah have the duty to try inform themselves ) we should n't make low-value arguments and articles on * any * topic prominent . 
  the thing about religions is that the poor fellahs are emotionally tied to it . 
  just like not all christians are nutty , not all muslims are , they ( mostly ) just grew up being told that stuff . 
  you can tell them otherwise , but learning is n't a matter of telling the whole topic , especially there are preconceptions saying otherwise . 
  nevertheless things have to be relevant to this and if it is old , there must be some reason for bringing it up . 
  and discussions should be discussions , not circlejerking or incessant whining . 
  i think it is ridiculous . 
  the eu is a wholly different beast than the coal-and-steel thing or since the euro . 
  is this a really strange way of saying ` give away your sovereignity ' or there ^ \\* will be war in the future or something . . 
  they fucked up the ` optimum monetary region ' and now they 're fucking up the `` optimum democratic regions '' . 
  i am sure [ the guardian responses list ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11cvzv/congratulations_to_eu_on_the_nobel_peace_prize/c6lcy90 ) has it covered . 
  the point is n't reducing the cost to the tax payer , the point is to * not * keep alive dysfunctional organizations . 
  i guess the loans do n't really need to be cancelled , they could help pay for the money other account holders had on the bank . 
  that 's why the banks should n't be too big . 
  i guess allowing banks to fail implies you need to make new ones though . 
  in the netherlands , [ fortis ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/fortis_%28finance%29 ) was broken up . 
  that is why the dutch government assures bank accounts up to 100k $ per person . 
  instead of bailing out banks , you can bail out all the customers , you know . 
  this is styled as a report , not an opinion piece , and i dont really see too much value in it as an opinion piece either . 
  and it 's value is what determines if it should be voted up , i think it is not . 
  i did n't say that ` this ' could be used as such . 
  i was just commenting on * one * of the points listed in the document . 
  now , at least , i do n't even believe it is necessarily a good idea , to actually hire someone for it , but someone posting well formulated information at the right time could make a difference . 
  i am very dubious about europe itself you know , as happens a lot ( but not quite enough , depending on the subreddit ) on reddit . 
  and it is valuable exactly when it is not an argument from authority . 
  ( and the top comments usually fail miserably because they 're knee-jerks ) you 're just calling me a federalist because i do n't want to focus on the storm in the glass , but instead on those at the horizon . 
  ( and closer ) [ terence moonseed ] ( http://thejuicemedia.com/ ) ca n't stop anyone . 
  edit : ftr : the dutch saying is ` storm in a glass ( like one you drink from ) of water ' is usually used to indicate something is blown out of proportion . 
  unless corporate/special interests are overly involved , i think we should ^ \\* not be too rash . 
  something that the title clearly promotes , what this has to do with a clown i can not fathom , looks like mood-setting activity to me . 
  i do n't like that style . 
  [ recent thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/10g6gd/the_european_commissionfunded_cleanit_project/ ) , i consider it a dupe . . and is [ via arstechnica ] ( http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/proposed-eu-plan-to-stop-terrorist-sites-even-more-ridiculous-than-thought/ ) , which is more even-keeled .
