  the size and culture of the financial sector comes into play there . 
  those points are only partially valid though . 
  the young do often have fewer obligations like children , fewer costs , if they live with their parents . 
  ( or they have the option to ) though mortages on houses are metal balls people chain themselves to . 
  unless the bank covers the risk of the price of the house falling , it is * a loan * covered by a house . 
  the awkwardness of it seems to be a feat to me . . 
   no , because of the decisions i 've made . 
  personally . 
  unless it involves migration none of them made you - not-greek ? 
  i guess it is n't a good description , you 're right on that . 
  but how you saying puts the onus on greeks as persons . 
  edit : why is this discussion is played as a tug of war on the points aswel ? 
  ( and feh , why do i care about that ), 
   well , no . 
  for example in the uk we 've had a very difficult time ` the uk ' ! = you , you feel entitled because of the country you 're from , and apparently have little empathy for people in greece . 
  ( ! = greece ), 
  ` the greeks ' simply allowed the problems of their society to continue , just like basically all the other societies . 
  it happens because it is very hard to change politically , because some portion of the population resists , and/or because it is hard to explain to the people what needs to be changed . 
  it just happened that it was the greeks were hit hard by it . 
  for many greek citizens the crisis is basically bad luck . 
  besides , the rest of the world is also responsible . 
  they lent the money to greece , if you make a stupid investment , expect loss . 
  often , they failed to know what was going on with how their retirement funds were managed . 
  maybe one day your society will be hit by whatever the consequences of all that surveilance , or maybe you should have been looking better at how nuclear weapons are stored , or power plants , or some chemical plant , or something else . 
  you dont want the greeks to go all like ` your own fault , you should 've just done x ' . 
  highest incarceration rate in the world , ( despite appearances ) bigger financial issues , bigger income divide , poorer healthcare for a large portion of the population , leading in stupid interventions in afghanistan , iraq , vietnam . 
  much worse public opinion about the us . 
  disfunctional democracy . 
  need i continue ? 
  the people that see it ... see it . 
  if you cant ` hit your target ' you have to write for whatever you might hit . 
  i think maybe it is over the top enough , but i am not sure . 
  that 's how i like my propaganda , clear what the message is and who sends it . 
  unlike all the propaganda that permeates our society , from advertising to pr that you are the product for when you read those free papers . 
  not sure if it puts the ` foreigners ' on a too ` adverserial ' position , maybe it is so over the top it does n't matter so much again . 
  they could have put a cowboy in there and tsar ( well , something russian . . a tank ? ), 
  in there to even things out ethnically a bit more . 
  homo sapiens are being out-sensed , out-gunned , out-calculated by their technology . 
  maybe we will be out-thought at some point . 
  homo sapiens value human being nearly having least to do with the technology , because what you get paid is a politics game , and not a meritocracy . 
  they make up silly titles for themselves . 
  kids may not take apart electronics that is thrown away , even if they contain useful parts , and they may learn something . 
  hell physics bachelors can not . 
  the most popular operating system vendors do not provide a basic cs learning package with the computer . 
  people try to make laws so they can make money . 
  they play a dangerous game of tying down knowledge and skills , calling it ` intelectual property ' . 
  they wear suits as if that makes them more important . 
  some humans have invented this thing called ` marketing ' and ` pr ' in order to shape the thoughts of the masses into something beneficial to them . 
  some even consider it something that you have to apply to your own mind to keep out negitivity . 
  humans had this nice thing they call ` the united nations ' , which they made after screwing up horribly ( wwii ) , and after ` the league of nations failed ' . 
  ( which was itself created after wwi ) however , they veto things all the time , and the only reason that held up was the invention of the nuclear bomb . 
  the loss to a community of ( long ) downtime is hard to determine and prove . . for instance for open source projects the gpl and copies are given away free . 
  as my father said , the costs of mistakes you 're allowed to make goes with the square of your income . 
  i think mostly political parties of the individual countries have formed ` equivalents ' in the eu parlement . 
  still , it is an ` extra degree of separation ' there , and in the past there were some issues with the eu commision having a lot of power relative to the parlement .

   capitalism : the law that the people of iceland have to pay the debts of their banks . 
  this sentence irks kindah me , but i am not really informed enough to respond . 
  capitalism as we know it is pretty much dominated by limited-liability corporations , and most of the time capitalism existed , bankrupcy also did . . 
  someone draw a pile of glitter with a bit of [ mitre ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/mitre ) and a finger sticking out : `` see through the superficial glitter '', 
  nice graphics , but would have been nice to know [ the gdps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_past_and_future_gdp_%28nominal%29 ) so you know much much money the percentages count for . 
  ( germany 3,286 g$ , france 1,333 g$ , italy 1,100 g$ , spain 582g $ , greece 92g $ ) although apparently the private debt is very big , the fraction of govt . 
  debt caused by bailing out the banks would be nice to know . 
  [ one of these graphs ] ( http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2008/12/more-bailout-comparisons/ ) shows it . 
  ( 10-20 % of gdp for these countries . ), 
  it seems that for many countries , the debt didnt really increase all that much ? 
  supposedly this already includes some bailouts of around 2008 . 
  the reason these debts have become a problem is because the state of the banks is unsure , and some of the countries which have loaned most which increases the interests rates . 
  having those loans was a bad idea , of course . . that said , i guess this is not my field , and i didnt look up enough , for instance how much they bailed out banks is perfectly quantifiable . 
  some of the links [ in this pocket guide ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/mdiud/the_eu_crisis_pocket_guide/ ) quantifies that , i think . 
  from the [ transnational institute ] ( http://www.tni.org/publications ) , found via [kritischestudentenutrecht.wordpress.com ] ( https://kritischestudentenutrecht.wordpress.com/ ) . 
  i have difficultly listening to him mentioning it without feeling he is * whining * about it though . 
  sure , admit it , other countries have political parties too , it is a fact he will have to live with . 
  considering recent events , how is it possibly strange that people dislike the eu ? 
  worse is the whining one hears sometimes about countries ` having the right ' to something with respect to the eu . . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
   sometimes , listening to lobbyists can strengthen ones own opinions and arguments which one already had beforehand . 
  i guess you mean you learn more from them , i mean , i could take that sentence more negatively . 
  ( sorry , i am hair splitter sometimes ) perhaps policians should try seek out experts in academia themselves , so they 're not dependent on the people that come to them ? 
   in contrast with many national parliaments , members do not seem to search that much for conflict , but rather for compromise . 
  perhaps a good side of being less in the medias focus ? 
  lets not imitate them . 
  we had ` stress tests ' on our banks , lexia passed them easily , and now ( less than a year later ? ), 
  it is in trouble . 
  besides the problems in southern europe would have become apparent at * some * point either way and the crisis originating from the us only set it off and worsened them . 
  ( and , of course the existence of this problem is due to corruption and incompetence , the first mostly on the greek side and the latter on the eu one . ), 
  recently ( ~ month ago ) belgians were on television talking about social support system as if there were no crisis . 
  are they in such a good state ? 
  ( i think they were just being overconfident , but that their economic state not horrible ), 
  i am a stupid retard , i know . 
  fuck it . 
  they are apparently stupid retards too , not seeing any of the crisis shit coming , if there is a probability mark rutte has an inkling bulgaria and romania joining is a bad thing , i will support bulgaria and romania 's not joining . 
  besides you said it :  after that every member country has to agree to that country joining . 
  politicians just spin it into a right . 
  i sure hope countries do n't get to deserve eu membership . 
  frankly , i would prefer to set every nation back a year just for claiming they ` deserve ' anything from europe . 
  basically , this is a kind of relationship . 
  someone may be a nice and lonely and all , but at no point does this make women coerced into marry him . 
  of course if the eu made agreements before , this does oblige us , but i do n't think this applies .
