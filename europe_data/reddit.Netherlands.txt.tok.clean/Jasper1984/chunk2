  ( edit : understatement ) i see some claims that it is being privatized too , but so far no links . 
  that is not very strong evidence . 
  how much damage to the church was there ? 
  to be frank , i think people are really pulling all their strings to try get xenophobia and fear of terrorism going again . 
  dont assume that blaming islamic extremists is an accident . 
  in the wikipedia page , i see this :  journalists lie in such a way . 
  the fight for ratios and editions . 
  bertelsmann , munich 2001 , isbn 3-570-00199-7 i dont know if that was ` denouncing ' journalism like this back then too . 
  that said , if it was then , why would it not be the same now . 
  btw , rt is rightly seen as a potentially biased source . 
  but then , it seems he spoke freely . 
  what options would he have ? 
  ally yourself to human kind , not your country . 
  well , you could say the title is suggesting too much empathy for the jihadists , but the word ` stuck ' is just part of the implication , and the word ` stuck ' by itself still means what it means . 
  look at the us democracy , and tell me if that means anything . 
  really , my ass , if you did your research , you know that you 're going out to protect , imperialism , 20th-century style . 
  yeah , damn that mandela guy . 
  stuckness is not related to intent or responsibility . 
  you 're either stuck or you are not . 
  and if you 're stuck halfway on a ledge you have options !, 
  you can jump down !, 
  not stuck at all i say !, 
  you are conflating judgement and blatantly changing the meaning of words . 
  if you 're stuck on a ledge halfway a cliff , you can jump down , you just have face falling to death . 
  if you want to judge people . . judge people ... be careful . 
  dont mangle definitions . 
  edit : / u/cbfw86 jumped on the word stuck , but he meant the connotation of the whole sentence . 
  a lot of this indeeds sounds like information war , but ... 
  were there separatist ' planes in the sky ? 
  why would the ukrainian troops shoot * anything * in the sky if there were not . 
  if it was shot down , it barely could be anyone else but the separatists . 
  ( or the russians ) and the russian convoy is suspicious as hell ... btw , it is funny on dutch tv the idea was around that we should be more fearful , seems like it was about isis , not russia - \\ _ - ( i say we should be more aware of the risks and the establishment that causes them ), 
  ** gross ** misrepresentation of what happened in mali . 
  i would assume it is a propaganda piece . 
  of course in order to simplify it towards ` against terrorism ' , it simplifies in a way that sounds ` against islam ' . 
  `` just the bad ones !, 
  '' , of course something that falls on deaf ears on radicalizers . 
  this is very convenient for those that want the fear and military industry going . 
  it does not even mention the tuaregs , that * switched side * against the islamists , because they clearly did not represent their interests , and were parasiting on their conquests .

  i am sure they come from the vagina with swords and black flags drawn . 
  the causes of this stuff is ultimately disenfranchisement of people , and the feeling that they are under attack . 
  and given the right wing parties , supported by * our * people may not be as violent , they are as stupid , and the wars * we * started , particularly in iraq , i cant blame them . 
  and it is known that people discriminate when they see islamic names on resumes . 
  ( though seriously , dont call that many people ` mohammed ' ... ) it is no excuse for supporting isis , but neither is isis an excuse for our ` solution ' is endless war in iraq , while not dealing with the underlying problems . 
  unfortunately , political parties in the eu are yet again being suckered into it , merely paying lip service to the underlying problems . 
  this time they will lose all my respect ... 
  i am not saying they should not bomb anything , or attack anyone , and i kindah expect that the kurds have more ideologically in common with us than other parties in the regio . 
  although of course , the establishments ' support of them is mainly opertunism . 
  if your blood boils , ask when does their blood boil ? 
  edit : maybe i should add that the left does have a blind spot for grievances and problems around etnicities . 
  i think i would be doing muslims a disservice if i had pulled that punch on the overuse of the name mohammed . 
  because he himself has judged the footage by his own association . 
  btw , been looking at [ some statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#by_area ) , any more detailed statistics available ? 
  for instance the timing might help . 
  russia is not any better by others being worse . 
  * whatever * . 
  i dont expect what . 
  good reasons / ` bad reasons ' fifty-fifty wont do . 
  especially the latter is bald lies no-one has yet to go to jail from . 
  have some fucking doubts about this .

  another ` coalition of the willing ' ? 
  well , i am not jumping for it . 
  are we sure this isil stuff is not overblown , and are we sure that approach is good ? 
  yeah , it is totally okay to be a meek person that follows whatever is going on , and doesnt take responsibility for his own actions . 
  and then join organizations known to do awful and very serious shit . 
  `` but countries need to be defended ! '', 
  really ? 
  i mean attacking the us , two options : you 're either 1 ) going to lose 2 ) boom boom bye civilization . 
  `` but if only the bad go there the organizations are going to be bad ! '', 
  you 're going to change those organizations , my ass . 
  they wont be sent out to dumb shit , my ass . 
   in july , prime minister orban made a speech in which he said hungary is aiming to become an illiberal state . 
  the eu commission declined comment on his words . 
  today wait , what did he say exactly ? 
  he said it straight-up ? 
  oh that line was completely about the lack of tools . 
  we dont have those tools right now , so they do with what they got . 
  wasnt meant to be disparaging anything , just that i can not seem to follow everything and conclude it as convincing evidence . 
  maybe i should look for other cases as example . 
  fox news is merely an extreme case , main stream media jump on particular interpretations of , for instance , fergison , and they do so for their own reasons . 
  its true that stuff like fox news depends on the viewers not finding stuff out for themselves . 
  its not entirely in the wrong direction . 
  but it just looks like the dots dont quite connect . 
  possibly if you look hard you can say definitely whether they do make good evidence or dont . 
  its not in our current level of detail most people want to look at it , probably . 
  isnt that * basically * what the us does .
