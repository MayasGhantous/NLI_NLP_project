  i dont think sanctions work in * this * case ... not by themselves , i expect there are too big egos and stakes in their own narrative . 
  if there is a way out and sanctions , that might work . 
  evidence would be appreciated ... 
  they should take themselves out of the current narrative , but it is not likely , certainly by itself and we shouldnt act as it is likely . 
  actions should be based on what the likely consequences are , not based on the consequences `` if these guys now also suddenly become super nice people , everything will work out '' . 
  btw , when the eu takes includes a country , well the country mostly adapts to the eu , and not the other way around . 
  typically , that makes sense . 
  however , it doesnt fit well with russia . 
  and matter-a-fact to some extent companies might be better off going via the eu if trade is easier in that direction . 
  ( obviously not saying it warrants any of russia 's behavior ), 
  i for one appreciate the eu not rushing into all economic sanctions . 
  take it from [ sun tzu ] ( https://librivox.org/the-art-of-war-by-sun-tzu/ ) , a cornered army will fight nail and tooth . 
  give them a way out . 
  of course the russian army , and rebels have a way out , it is putin and friends that need a way out . 
  find a way to give them that , and then hit them with the sanctions , and hope they 'll take it . 
  problem is , dont want this mess again soon ... and dont want to give anything big either . 
  well , * i * like to actually own my devices , and run whatever the fuck i want . 
  plenty of devices dont co-operate and i dont want laws to do it too . 
  and your problem isnt restricted to kaspersky , any closed source software has that issue . 
  hell , i kindah wonder if open software is really that well patrolled . 
  ( and hardware also has some ability to betray you . ), 
  generally , our main computers are insecure . 
  that could be fine if they are insecure against spear fishers . 
  but most exploits can be applied automatically . 
  eventually implants will be part of the dragnet surveillance , and no-one will own a computer in the sense that they have control over it . 
  they 're just allowed some of it by the real owner . 
  probably we will be allowed a bunch of things , but i dont want to be 100 % surveilled . 
  ultimately , i believe the main computer is a lost cause , and we need cheap secondary computers that dont run a million programs and use a million file formats , each with potential exploits . 
  what do i * really * need to be secure ? 
  basically , its just a good fraction of articles , chatting , a forum and messages . 
  ( btw , i dont think airgaps are good . 
  too much fuss , and , apparently , mounting exploits . . ) and of course the ( public key ) cryptography stuff and stuff for them newfangled blockchain technology . 
  personally , i dont think they should be entirely unwelcome , however there are limitations to how much immigration populations can take , and culturally , it is unclear who will adapt and who doesnt . 
  not so much about genes . 
  i mean humans genomic future is either manipulation or evolution . 
  the latter hurts a lot , and the former doesnt care as much about the current genes , more about what sort of genes our culture and the system set up selects . 
  charter cities are an idea . 
  basically , smallish areas with rules aimed at success , and some ideals like freedom to start your own enterprises and speech . 
  these would possibly need a ` business model ' , preferably something fitting the location and that soaks a bit of labour . 
  probably dont want to assume everyone is unskilled . 
  ( also , teach them english . ), 
  i cant say i know that much about the above idea , but i like proactive ideas . 
  potentially they attract terrorists . 
  it doesnt necessarily give much advantage to them , though . 
  so he doesnt get any credits for courage , so what , doesnt weaken his argument at all . . 
  moreso than for instance the us ? 
  i wouldnt believe that sentiment much without more information . 
  gdp isnt really very indicative of how useful the economy is to actual people , and afaik it isnt that easily measured anyway . 
  [ here is a per-capita list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) . 
  nk is awful of course , 1.8 k $ , compared to russia 17.8 k $ , or europe average 34.5 k $ or the us 53.1 k $ . 
  also ... dont think that is at all purchasing-power compensated . 
  this is also why it would be better to have actual statistics rather than ` stories ' . 
  i often say this , and get waved away as ` dehumanising ' or `` one death is a tragedy , a million is a statistic '' . 
  but statistics is how you can properly look at this information , looking at it otherwise is in many cases , basically , blindness . 
  that is not to say that the above argument is the reason for the lack of statistics . 
  the reason is that there is no systematic store for it , and more importantly , many journalists dont understand basic statistics . 
  anyway , the fact that the events in ukraine bring up stories that wouldnt have been anything otherwise is something to take into account . 
  very little is sweet about this . 
  especially considering stuff the previous russian military doctrine said . 
  ( apparently made less extreme in current version , but ... ), 
  infact , when i mentioned that [ the ribbon of st. george would be inappropriate for an humanitarian aid convoy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._george_ribbon#use_during_2014_pro-russian_conflict_in_ukraine ) , i immediately got accused of comparing it to nazis . 
  ( [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dbf20/cnn_developing_red_cross_kiev_says_reports_of/cjnzsrc ) ) even though by his own admission :  what i want to stress is that this ribbon is the symbol of russian pride about its involvement in the `` great fatherland war '' ( aka ww2 ) and victory . 
  that is how it is seen in russia . 
  it is a symbol for a fight against nazism . 
  and ukraine is being called ` facist ' . 
  connect the obviously connected dots . 
  of course the ribbon is just side evidence , might have been a mistake etcetera . 
  the whole convoy thing might at that point have been a publicity stunt . 
  ( although that cant be asssumed ), 
  that seems like a strong statement . 
  * any * evidence for the other side of the logistics to get the western goods to the trucks once in ukraine ? 
  besides , if the trucks were full , and emptied in ukraine , they could still take on western goods . 
  ( 3 ) quite a bit depends on when the pictures were taken , and what determined which trucks were seen . 
  they could have been filled additionally afterwards . 
  if the russians could select which were seen , they could simply have some innocuous ones and fill the rest with whatever they want to . 
  yeah , its either capitalism or communism right ? 
  you make everything fit predefined boxes . 
  got it . 
  governments can be bad , but if the public doesnt own stuff that generate income , the publics ' income is determined on market demand . 
  no guarantees there . 
  in principle the markets make incomes low , but then goods become cheap too , so everyone is better off . 
  in practice . 
  not so much . 
  ( although there is plenty of corruption around to murken the issue ), 
  education doesnt by itself fix wealth disparity . 
  neither internal , or globally . 
  markets dont fix it either . 
  educations gives tools that help though , and it does increase wealth , but the increased income is limited because at some point it isnt scarce . 
  i think ultimately to improve wealth disparity is to make things less centrally owned . 
  for instance , less corporations with stocks and more co-operatives . 
  another is something like ubi , but the economics of that seems more tricky . 
  yeah , that is what it meant , it doesnt belong on a humanitarian convoy . 
  it is * a * piece of evidence that it isnt as claimed . 
  i am not interested in what the ukraine goverment is , whatever the rebels are doing is not a solution anyway . 
  ukraine being ` neonazi ' is just russian propaganda to whip up some nationalism . 
  there were neonazis at a violent demonstration ? 
  shocker !, 
  there usually are . . 
  a ribbon that ` constitutes one of the most recognised and respected symbols of military valour in modern russia ' belongs in a humanitarian mission . 
  it was ribbon was a decorative infront many/most the vehicles .
