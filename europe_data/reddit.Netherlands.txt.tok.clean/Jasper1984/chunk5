  maybe they didnt want to paint it over and it is a coincidental thing . 
  but i doubt it . 
  it is just one piece of evidence against this being a humanitarian mission . 
  i am mentioning it nothing to do with ` turning it into a swastika ' or something . 
  i suppose you 're worried about the us spinning or something . 
  feh , saw some ` hard talk ' - like shit in euronews , i was hoping it wouldnt be as awful as cnn . 
  ( ` hard talk ' is basically : let me ask you some loaded/suggested questions , and pretend to have a discussion ), 
  i linked it . 
  [ this is more than just truck drivers ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bu05vjlccaacc6q.png ) . 
  and videos include [ st.george ribbon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._george_ribbon#use_during_2014_pro-russian_conflict_in_ukraine ) , and a radar tower on a truck . 
  russian soldiers seem to have leaked a bit on social networks too . 
  russia _ knows _ ` sending help ' like this would not be trusted , and that should stop them from doing so . 
  or at least give extensive evidence to the contents of this thing . 
  we should tell them to back off and assume those are not mere supply trucks . 
  but still gather information of course . 
  ` large scale aggression ' could be large scale aggression in , say , ukraine . 
  also , that one is from 2000 , and i read they made a new one in 2010 . 
  alledgedly making the rules more restrictive . 
  ( i.e. 
  [ this link ] ( http://www.linkedin.com/groups/russia-concept-limited-nuclear-strike-2456108.s.5850660652707770372 ) ), 
  i am comparing the reasons for dismissing them ; lack of ` direct evidence ' , and the conclusion of agreeing with them not fitting the picture of the world . 
  ( although for me it does ) really , i agree , it is sensationalist and linkbaitish , [ some of the links here do better ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2d7kjf/putin_believes_he_can_win_a_war_with_nato/cjmvmwm ) . 
  i think the possibility of a new cold war should be taken seriously , given the consequences . 
  in the cold war there was the korean and vietnam war , but the possibility of nukes used there was improbable . 
  ukraine is closer to home for both parties , and that does make it more dangerous . 
  although russia is officially not involved . 
  ( edit : but most definitely involved , in my estimation ), 
  nonsense , some dudes in power tell some minions with switches that launch nuclear missiles . 
  or sorry , did i say dumbass minions ? 
  i mean tough super-cool soldiers . 
  ( edit : yeah the good staying out would make the soldiers all bad . . thats the problem , it is a stupid thing to do , but it might be worse if it is only done by stupid people ... so probably they 're not all bad . . maybe ) the general public of the country has nothing to do with it , other than they allowed the dudes in power get in power . 
  you know who also didnt have any direct evidence ? 
  [ thomas andrews drake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_andrews_drake#whistleblowing_on_trailblazer.2c_and_government_response ) and [ william binney ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_binney_%28u.s._intelligence_official%29#whistleblowing ) . 
  so excuse me if it take it seriously . 
  edit : [ see links here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2d7kjf/putin_believes_he_can_win_a_war_with_nato/cjmvmwm ) , for instance . 
  it * was * over , we 're just potentially standing at the brink of a new one . . 
  how could we go about making a list of these instances ? 
  who owns those companies , and how much power do lobbies have ? 
  industry doesnt need taking over . 
  quite a lot of companies use multiple brands , obscuring how few there really are . 
  for instance frames for glasses , and plenty of farmers have few or no options with regard to who they sell their stuff to . 
  ( [ a story on it ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sticker-shock-why-are-glasses-so-expensive-07-10-2012/ ) , unfortunately very blablaish ) the small number of media companies is well known too . 
  companies like google are the railroad companies of us ' past . 
  although in the railroads case , they were more aware of it , when the big rail companies started giving companies priviledged access to transport in exchange for more power over the region . 
  fortunately , * really * google 's and facebooks positions are not all that entrenched . 
  simply convincing users to go elsewhere would cause the companies to shrink . 
  unfortunately , everything is tracked . 
  < drumroll  ... because there is a war going in east ukraine . 
  there is a clear border to the war to the east , not to the west . 
  and i dont know how the family ties go , but if families as a whole are typically in the same country , within ukraine , people can go to family easier . 
  0.5 m people , is that a lot ? 
  44.2 m people in ukraine . . 
  i see it is working very well , i must be a racist because i worry america will turn into a facist state . 
  downvote me some more to prove that you have been warned . 
  racism and anti-semitism are * other * things than facism . 
  `` you can fuck each other in the butt '' - freedom is not all that much freedom at all . 
  they proudly proclaim the freedoms that dont harm status quo . 
  that is where your association comes from , i am afraid . 
  whether the us is facist or not remains to be seen when the veal of delusion wears off . . 
  the border is 5km away , hard to estimate the distance . 
  the smoke plume seems significiant though . 
  about the angular height of the poles , about 100m away . 
  lets say they are 5m tall , then the smoke plume is 250m high . 
  seems too high if they just started firing , accepting the other observations , i 'd say inside russian territory . 
  it could still be stay ` insurgents ' . 
  however , i am also doubtful those are not of russian origin . 
  ( though i am not sure if they are led by more central russian authority . ), 
  the one in the submission link seems to have much less red/dark skies . 
  could be two shootings . 
  ( caveit : i am not a reporter . 
  if you are . . re check everything . 
  print it out . ), 
   i think this is great !, 
  we could finally minimize nationalisms . 
  and live freely under one european flag . 
  thats not how it works . 
  people dont like europe and nationalism would go through the roof hating it . 
  also , we 're going to get fucked over by lobbying , stuffing everything in brussels is like painting a target on your back . . 
  it is happening already . 
  but your view of the things seems too rosy in the first place . 
  i dont trust it . . 
  the democracy doesnt function too well , the banks crap , and problems with the euro persists . 
  corporations make special deals about taxes too , have way more power , and are more persistent than plebs . 
  i would like to remind you that they try to track every single damn thing you do . 
  yes , also the eu , i mean , that is their anti-crime approach . 
  and i am supposed to trust them ? 
  dont look to me for a thurrough criticism though . . 
  just because these guys exist doesnt mean better society critics and do-ers exist . 
  quite a bit of activity from the bitcoin angle , my favorite being [ ethereum ] ( https://ethereum.org/ ) . 
  though bitcoin itself seems in danger of being compromised , starting from ghash.io and bitcoinfoundation . 
  and of course , the open source angle itself is a thing , though by itself it seems to miss the handle on actual economies that blockchains give . 
  note that they may or may not be anarchists  actually , i personally totally dont believe in anarchism , although i 'd be a fool to claim to foresee the implications of blockchain technology . 
  pretty sure if anything were to happen , command immediately shifts to some nato chain of command , and everything is ( ready to be ) tanked up . 
  so i dont see a problem there . 
  really hope it isnt needed , and as it looks now , doesnt seem it will be . 
  wait they need to get seats in each country separately , or nothing ? 
   i would agree there is still room for improvement i would say that is a gross understatement . 
  that said , i would say there are wider reasons why the eu isnt nearly as good as it could be , for instance consumer society , lack of faith in politics . 
  ( cant say the latter is entirely unwarrented ), 
  different ways of organizing * do * have different outcomes .
