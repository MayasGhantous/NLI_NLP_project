  besides , the status quo is bad anyway , they 're on our side , * sortah * . 
  would you also say that if they were cooperating against human trafficking ? 
  water is currently not free either . 
  the problem is that the water infrastructure will probably be operated * worse * if privatized . 
  there is only one water network . 
  it is not a market . 
  service hasnt really gotten better for other things that arent really market . 
  door to door post , electricity , trains . 
  personally i doubt the ` base ' insurance everyone should have doesnt work any better via companies than it would via government either . 
  if you just gave the healthcare when needed , you 'd cut out nearly all the paperwork , and all the marketing and such those companies were doing . 
  edit : whatever your position , how this is being arranged seems backhanded . 
  when we take it back . 
  * take * it back . 
  dont pay for it , maybe compensate for real investments in infrastructure , but certainly dont give them a profit from buying the public resource . 
  it will make it harder to sell later . 
  because of the potential of it just being taken back without any money in return . 
  really the left should focus on stuff like this more . 
  instead about how ` these poor guys need ' healthcare/money/whatever . 
  that stuff devolves the politics into spend more vs spend less , but the underlying principles indicate more . 
  make the spectrum that is currently ` sold ' , leased instead . 
  or at least , licensed for some duration of time . 
  people who buy spectrum for systems need some guarantee it will stay available . 
  get the trains back , get the postmen back ( and send them every other day , a postman each day has become too expensive ) , those things dont work like a market , and there are no gains in ` freedoms ' running them as a market so dont do that . . 
  they selected what footage to put in there , and what to music to play with it , so that is not it . 
  transparancy requires people being able to decide what they look at themselves , not cherrypicked content . 
  ( edit : of course other videos may show transparancy , for instance indicating policies etc. ), 
  you can see it as education , so people ( vaguely ) learn where the missions are/were , and what the idea is . 
  ( usually law and order ) or if more negatively inclined as propaganda . 
  well , it certainly isnt very elaborate about when governments are deemed suitable for such support . 
  i think most people would consider representativeness of the population , respect for minorities , etcetera required . 
  islamization you fight by empowering the young women . 
  maybe it also helps if everyone who is unemployed and gets money from the state has to do some mandatory public service , so they stay in contact with the rest of society . 
  ( i can not fathom why they 're not considering that ) this case doesnt require any action other than applying the law . 
  those are not measures you 'll hear from populist political parties that decry islamization . 
  i want to reject my bit . 
  i get it , you dont take it on their authority . 
  guess what , whining about it isnt going to help . 
  if greece isnt # 1 a good study wouldnt find it as such . 
  if you 're right the study is n't , so go for the study and criticize that properly . 
  instead of claiming you have the magic eyes that see better , that is . 
   we are completely unable to combat climate change without acting together and centralising climate policy in one institution . 
  well recently in the dutch tweede kamer ( parliament ) simulataniously : 1 . 
  technology does not reduce need for labour . 
  * people have to work harder !, 
  * people have to learn all their lives !, 
  * we got to get them robotics companies here !, 
  * ( implied ) this is progress . 
  which is a totally insane position , if you ask me . 
  they * like * race to the bottom , also for labour . 
  do n't expect solidarity on unemployment , they 'll ask i.e. 
  spain to reduce the quality of labour available . 
  quite frankly , such neoliberal forces are probably in power in the eu aswel . 
  i am sure that forces that would prevent the eu from acting on climate change exist aswel . 
  the advantage of age is that you can be more consistently wrong . 
   done . 
  germany steps up [ just like britain . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/27/uk-mediterranean-migrant-rescue-plan ), 
  ah right , [ found it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ju75h/30_years_on_french_agent_apologises_for_sinking/?ref=search_posts ) . 
  the democracynow report seems to miss the apology from france . 
  ( the exact nature of it i dont know of course ), 
  and for how long should they wait ? 
  how long do you think this war will still take ? 
  what chances do they have to build a life in lebanon , turkey or other countries in the region ? 
  those chances are poor , for the record . 
  not like i.e. 
  turkey is going to be nice to them . 
  i mean , the kurds are indigenous and * turkey * is the one that re-engaged hostilities . 
  hell , the incursions into iraq and syria from turkey are probably * mostly * against kurds , not against isis as claimed . 
  ( you know , the kurds , the pkk , pesh merga , our ( nato ) allies that we 're allowing turkey to stab in the back ? 
  the only group that is can really be considered ideologically aligned to our beliefs ? ), 
  so they used the guy like the one with the giant shoulder fillings backs then too ? 
  ( edit : as others said , is it real ? 
  doesnt look like satire to me ), 
   with all that 's going on in europe ( and indeed the world ) , let 's turn the focus away from the media and the news for a minute to focus on something more important : you . 
  would make more sense to do this when there is some down time from things happening in the world . 
  which scarcely happens , but presumably the rate of events does fluctuate . 
  but then , * fine * , besides , a lot of time has passed with a lot of stuff happen got ta do this sometimes . 
  well i only like my phones tin-foil-wrapped :-p, 
  did i have to say that i wanted good ones ? 
  well ... it * is * alternative ... 
  but it looks like a lot of nonsense to me . . and which language is that . . 
  well , no doubt there are some truths there , but immigration and racism are also tools to divide and conquer . 
  though it does annoy me that democracynow did not report how rude those two black lives matter protesters were to bernie sanders . 
  edit : basically i do n't care about immigration so much . . not in the way that `` populists '' care about . 
  i disdain the lack of pro-active response to such events . 
  ( and `` just keep them out '' is * also * reactive ) i fear the growth of panopticon , corporate and financial sector power . 
  the name jalta does bode well for that . 
  edit : [ i.e this ] ( https://jalta.nl/geschiedenis/neofilhellenisme-de-linkse-liefde-voor-griekenland-ontleed/ ) ... cant read it at this point , of course . 
  but no doubt they 're going to sell greek assets . 
  it will end up sending money to corporate and financial power . 
  and the greek people ? 
  they had at best as much power over their government as we do . 
  edit2 : i scarcely see anyone really bringing history into attention . 
  wwii indonesia . . all within well defined lines . 
  almost cynically not-remembering the forces that actually create and risk wars that are just as bad , * now * . 
  when iraq is mentioned , and there is any military guy they 'll say `` he fought for freedom '' . 
  like that guys feelings matter more that iraq is in a long line of pointless wars , and that they just had a chance to say so . 
  they basically promote the same damn thing that causes this sort of thing . 
  i mean people being `` brave and non-pc '' are really just saying their selfish thing . 
  the one that benefits them , because they are the `` victim '' of it .
