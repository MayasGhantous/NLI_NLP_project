  even though the immigrants are the ones that clearly have it worse . 
  even though societies in the west are at fault or complicit . 
  real history . . 
  i dont claim to know it , i claim to see * no * attempt to have any search for the real reality out there right now . 
  it is all highly selective . 
  similar to the current events , highly selective . 
  formats that are `` current '' ( whats the word . . ) that actually obscure the realities , you have to take the longer view . 
  and the short nos news should also have news that doesnt poke through to warrant a report . 
  long treatments of things ... you already know what they 're going to say . 
  in the netherlands , bad journalism is `` ingeburgerd '' met `` komkommertijd '' , of course . 
  hell , the `` zomerjournaals '' or better termed `` vakantiejournaals '' . 
  it is almost like , `` why even bother '' . 
  8 minute segments of the tour de france on the non-sports channel . 
  not that all the reporters are bad . 
  but the total result does seem pretty bad , to be frank . 
  and of course , if they 'd ask for more funding , rtl wil whine about `` marktvervalsing '' . 
   the land handout is a radical scheme from the russian government to reverse a potentially catastrophic population decline on the pacific rim in the extreme east of the country . 
  `` catastrophic '' ? 
  potentially carefully chosen . 
  it is not `` disasterous '' , which would fall flat on its face . 
  empty land disasterous ? 
  catastrophic has some connotations of disaster , but plausible deniability . 
  real reason of course indicated later in the story . 
  chinese people there , also not exactly disasterous . 
  nothing against the russians though , i mean , if this is power at play . . it is the nicer part . 
  also , will there be internet connection ? 
   i do n't give a flying fuck if the us is spying on isis supporters , communists , capitalists , pro-russian politicians , anti-american politicians or whatever in germany , but the german government should . 
  well part of the intelligence industry is private . 
  hired by capitalist . 
  i am not jumpy for more corporate power . 
  and i suppose that treaties say something about this ? 
  or does that mean something for being in nato etc too ? 
  quite frankly you can not say that the us sufficiently follows a set of ideals that we can support and we should be allies to them less . 
  fucking `` ttip so we 're stronger vs china '' is a warmongering disgrace . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/17/the-euro-is-a-disaster-even-for-the-countries-that-do-everything-right/?postshare=3261437169131539 ) compares just finland , iceland and the netherlands . 
  stupid thing to compare . 
  almost all countries have a significant part of the gdp in the government . 
  counter-cyclical spending is a thing . 
  something else might be [ fusion catalyzation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muon-catalyzed_fusion ) . . 
  however dont see it happening . 
  i mean i doubt even 2.2 s decay time ; a million times more than muons , would give it enough time to fuse enough to get the energy back . 
  ( since these collisions produce so much other crap . . ) the amount of matter being accellerated is tiny at the lhc it 'd have to be ; 7tev in protons is about 7000x kinetic energy than the mass energy , or 7000mc ^ 2 or 7000c ^ 2 / kg = 6.3 \u22c5 10 ^ 20 j/kg or about [ all uranium resources available for generating energy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orders_of_magnitude_ ( energy \\ ) ) , and that is before any losses . 
  the number of fundamental particles is pretty limited . 
  well , if it is ever mandatory , i guess the vote is anonymous , and people can always vote `` fuck you '' . 
  oh sorry , i suffer from fuck-you-blindness . 
  yeah , perhaps we should set up pipelines to make the metadata there less powerful ... 
  we 're an-mass using centralized servers - like-this one , and not using cryptography , or https with its weak certificate system . 
  that is totally changable . 
  ( of course , mass-use of software vulnerabilities might ensue ), 
  instead of only being surveilled by algorithms with crude understanding of what is going on , we could be surveilled by ai with equal understanding of what is going on as an employee could . 
  it might still be tricky for people to interface with the thing , but they could effectively have a `` ai employee '' tracking everyone , all the time . 
  ( what we 're living in surveilance-wise is more than orwells book , 1984 imagined , and could be far worse ), 
  so hopeful , and probably , so miserably mistaken . 
  well , i dont trust it much . 
  the power of the eu commission is something * particularly * up for discussion when it comes up whether the eu is democratic enough . 
  it is * authoritarian * to take the opinion of the establishment , however legitimate or not , as fact . 
   but do n't let facts get in the way of an opinion . 
  you mean authority . 
  i mean , you literally take fact sheets from the eu commision as facts . 
  yet well informed people keep attacking it . 
  i have tried reading it , find it a bit hard to figure what it means on the ground . 
  but that these people say it is crap , and the secrecy and lack of guarantee published-time-before-implementation is enough for me . 
  and here i was thinking public relations was weird to mention in that way . 
  it might stop health workers from visiting . 
  really , the children or other people not visiting the parents is heartless . 
  i think the worry is that robots might be enablers for that . 
  the health of older people has gotten better aswel , and the age at which people go to pensions has already been raised in many countries . 
  really though , sometimes this is pretty unjust , as slightly different `` life-paths '' or ages can make a large difference . 
  i like the idea of [ charter cities ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_romer ) , basically an area where the laws are changed for prosperity . 
  basically similar to chinas economic area . 
  of course , different situations call for different approaches . 
  ( i dont think making it a democracy is * always * wise , short-term , though it should always provide some certainties . ), 
  ( edit : watching [ the second video ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_romer_the_world_s_first_charter_city ) , seems very commercial , worries like race-to-the-bottom of regulation come to mind ) of course , the situation where richer people dont get too many children isnt going to last forever . 
  probablly will last a while . 
  it shouldnt be secret . 
  go all like , tut , tut , i am sure it wont be bad . 
  ( like sopa , which we shut dont wikipedia for , remember ? ), 
  and then bang !, 
  it whacks you in the face with a [ fast-track ] ( https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/we-need-stop-white-house-putting-tpp-and-ttip-fast-track-ratification ) . 
  ( didnt they have a fast-track of sorts in britain , so the bloody queen could read it ? 
  who bloody cares if the queen reads it ? 
  fake reason ) `` tut , tut '' only should ever work in an atmospher of trust , trust that * should damn well * be lost by now . 
  `` communism '' isnt what you think it is , ( it certainly isnt ... whatever the ussr did ) and political parties that used to be communist in the past are rarely still so today . 
  well , some people are saying this is just some local stuff . 
  i dont like erdogan , ( from what little i know ) and shit is corrupt , but that doesnt necessarily mean that things are going backward . 
  probably because they have difficulty getting volume , because they need to maintain the entire length of rail , and because they need to deal with the people along the rail , particularly during construction . 
  lower flexibility , some of which also means that it doesnt easily want to act like a market . 
  edit : some things need to be done as a community . 
  incredibly , there are ideologies that in essence deny this . 
  main gain for trains is that they have a much better potential energy efficiency for the same speed . 
  pushing off from the earth , not a tiny bit of air , no waiting with taxying and stuff , no travel to the city from the airport . 
  shame our ns was corrupt and fucked up the [ fyra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fyra ) . 
  well , stuff like killing off the competition , like killing off the polish resistance against germany , wasnt very honorable either . 
  in the netherlands am annoyed at wwii memorials , claiming to be about `` peace '' and `` freedom '' . 
  going for the `` easy '' wwii conflict . 
  not the wars where * we * fucked up , or supported fucking up other peoples ' peace and freedom . 
  it is not uncommon to call iraq veterans to be `` fighting for our freedom '' at these events . 
  i respect our military , what they 're going through and shit . 
  but `` for our freedom '' , it it wasnt . 
  and then no-one has the balls to say we went to iraq for lies , and that there is this pattern of doing so , and that we 're the ones who are fucking up other countries .
