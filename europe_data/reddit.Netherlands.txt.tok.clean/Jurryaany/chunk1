  it 's literally his name . 
  thank you , kgb . 
  it would all be dutch . 
  i disagree with you . 
  if anything , this organisation views the perceived `` rise '' of `` islamic morals '' in their country as a threat to the very right of free expression in the first place . 
  their arguments are actually pretty strong if you look into them , they argue that their intolerance of drawings of muhammad and their wish to have them declared illegal is in direct opposition to the right of free expression , which it is . 
  similarly , the they also argue that things like wearing wearing veils as a muslim woman is out of force and pressure from the husband in accordance with the same `` islamic morals . '', 
  i 'm not going to say that they 're right or wrong in believing these things , we all have opinions on that and you clearly do too , but i will say that just because they have a controversial opinion does not mean that they 're outside of the law . 
  the right to free expression applies just as much to them as it does to us or to our muslim countrymen . 
  getting baked is more important . 
  nice map , what is the source ? 
  ... well ? 
  you got ta go when you got ta go . 
  they most likely asphyxiated . 
  that many people breathing inside a refrigerated truck and the oxygen quickly runs out . 
  nice try , greek board of education . 
  they were still soviet-occupied . 
  nice try cypriot board of education . 
  and he also clarified that bosnians are ethnic serbs living in bosnia and that he 's totally not a bosniak , which are `` muslim scum ! '', 
  yeah ... 
  what you 're thinking of are photons , electrons are also nearly massless but are trapped in orbit around the nucleus of an atom , consisting of protons and neutrons . 
  electrons are negatively charged and are in a bond with the much more massive positively charged and massive protons in the nucleus . 
  okay i laughed . 
  obligatory plug for / r/tomscott, 
  is that liam neeson in the narration ? 
  what happened in 1859 ? 
  the eu itself does n't have an opinion though , it 's an organisation founded on the member countries . 
  who are you attributing this point of view to ? 
  not even federalists , which are tiny in number i might add , see it this way . 
  holy shit i do n't think i laughed that hard since a week !, 
  i have no idea . 
  an exit out of the eu of the [ visegr\u00e1d group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group ) consisting of poland , the czech republic , slovakia and hungary . 
  but what is it ? 
  lithuania can into nordic . 
  women are equally entitled to welfare as men are . 
  he 's too prominent a person , i doubt they 'd go this far , but i 've been wrong too . 
  okay , so romania has gas oil deposits themselves , denmark has access to north sea reserves , but where does estonia get their hydrocarbons ? 
  still better than the actual terrorists that ran it before this coup . 
  the picture on the dutch news site [ here ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2084913-nederland-en-duitsland-tekenen-voor-militaire-samenwerking.html ) is absolutely great as well . 
  this is sarcasm , right ? 
  well , if you want to simplify the french language you have a long way to go . 
  well , it does help that the mods are pretty active in removing offensive comments . 
  whether you think that 's a good or a bad thing , it does make / r/europe appear less racist when all the racists are silenced . 
  this issue has been raised a few times in the recent past , especially since the russian intervention in ukraine , and even though the public and political parties are becoming more in favour of it , they are still massively divided on the topic . 
  shameless plug for the completely unbiased and non-partisan \u00a9 subreddit on the topic : / r/northatlantictreaty, 
  as a coin collector , this is one hell of a sexy coin , congratulations on your first commemorative euro , i hope to find it soon !, 
  / r/etymologymaps there you go . 
  ** edit : ** it 's fixed now . 
  i have not heard of this . 
  literally ~ 15 guys in a remote finnish town . 
  i ca n't believe reuters actually considers to be news . 
  i seem to remember a recent proposed deal with russia in another eastern european country unfolding wildly differently . 
  while i understand where you 're coming from , i do disagree . 
  what charlie hebdo is doing is an exercise in free speech and social commentary . 
  i think it 's pretty great what they do actually , their prints display angles that are always thought-provoking . 
  it 's definitely a love it or hate it paper though , if you 're not into this kind of commentary then i can certainly see how people are n't interested in it and similar papers , and , of course , dislike them . 
  i am by no means a fan of wilders , and i 'm pretty appalled by the turn / r/europe seems to be taking as of late , but there is a clear distinction . 
  wilders is hating the game , not the players . 
  we have already frozen a lot of the overseas assets linked to oligarchs linked to the kremlin . 
  from what i can tell it does have impact in dividing the oligarchy in pro and anti-putin camps , but as long as putin still controls the media and the hearts and minds of the people , not much is going to happen . 
  they 're pretty divided on it , to say the least . 
  then i see no reason to cancel the sanctions . 
  that 's good , but they still need to be punished for wrecking an entire street . 
  bless you . 
  that 's a bit of a leap to make , he has n't said that at all . 
  edit : since the original post was removed , i 'll try to recall it to the best of my ability here : `` finally the pope realises islam wants to conquer europe '', 
  is this really whataboutism coming from poland ? 
  oh how the tables have turned . 
  it 's rather easy to call something lawful when you 're the one writing the laws , or at least pressuring others in places of power to write laws for you . 
  oh boy , i am ready for the comment section here . 
  and this on spiegel !, 
  colour me surprised . 
  please go away from the netherlands , too . 
  i was in the present . 
  this move is in response to sweden introducing border controls on the danish border at midnight last night . 
  the danish response is to prevent masses of undocumented migrants from piling up in copenhagen , near sweden . 
  temporary , for 10 days . 
  absolutely depressing . 
  i 'm jealous . 
  for the first day in weeks , yeah , but on average it 's almost spring-like . 
  it was fun while it lasted . 
  i do n't know about latvia , but here it feels like april already , weather-wise . 
  edgy . 
  i wish it would just snow already instead of this measly rain bullshit . 
  i do n't mind the temperature , shit just needs to be less grey . 
  they seem to have a thing for politicians in particular . 
  and who will build the roads !, 
  yes , but not in the appeasing sense . 
  as the old saying goes :  nato exists to keep the germans down , the americans in , and the russians out . 
  of course , the focus has shifted since the soviet union ceased to exist and 9/11 happened , but it appears to be going back to its roots now , with the exception of keeping germany down , the need for that has largely subsided . 
  that 's actually a great page on the nato website , thanks for linking , bookmarked it for future reference . 
  i do n't know about others , but i 'm not very comfortable upvoting editorials . 
  on / r/worldnews , but also often here , they are taken as truths far too often by people just reading the headline and assuming it 's a news story rather than an opinion piece . 
  i 'm glad op marked it properly , though . 
  and how they still praise themselves for being anti-fascist and fighting the `` fascist junta in ukraine . '', 
  has been for a while . 
  - crickets -, 
  oil rig workers and ship crews will complain about it .
