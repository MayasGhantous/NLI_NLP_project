  these are the figures for / r/europe rather than reddit as a whole though , i think there must be more at play here . 
  that does n't really explain why the uk is so far down , though . 
  it appears that smaller countries ( population-wise ) have relatively more / r/europe redditors than larger ones . 
  while i expected this , i have no idea how to even begin explaining it . 
  ukraine joining the eu is not going to happen for at least 20 years . 
  leaving over it now is nothing but shortsighted . 
  similar video for the south african rooikat : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8apualybxwq, 
  i 'm sure the eu criticised romania equally . 
  right ? 
  ** the [ fyra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fyra ) . 
  ** it was a high-speed rail link between amsterdam and brussels , but it crashed and burned pretty much immediately and turned into a huge failure . 
  it started off pretty normally , with the usual complaints of late trains , but the problems kept escalating . 
  trains were shoddy and parts actually fell off during normal operation , then winter came and it snowed and even large parts fell off . 
  the trains have been idle for over two years now . 
  the state is getting most of their money back but the amount of effort that took is barely worth it . 
  ** moral of the story : italian engineering is an oxymoron . 
  ** ** edit : ** goddamnit i just learned that the train i ride with is to be replaced with an italian model too , starting 2018 . 
  a classic piece of vice `` news '', 
  the netherlands though . 
  nothing is , and most do , but have you ever heard a finnish or dutch song on your radio ? 
  to athens to ease the tension on the border . 
  just come back , together we can rule the galaxy , son . 
  i found it alarming how few people on / r/europe knew of this when they were cheering for front national . 
  the uk definitely punches above their weight in the music industry too , but it is important to keep in mind that the uk has an advantage because english is the current lingua franca . 
  but what does it mean ? 
  water still wet, 
  not only is europe home to the vast majority of american ancestry , the two are linked by sharing common values and views of liberty and democracy . 
  i believe that is something that you should n't just take for granted and that we should be willing to stand strong for our allies in either direction across the atlantic . 
  got me . 
  make him cycle !, 
  another strike against eu membership . 
  it 's a part of the ttp and ttip agreements that the us are pushing for . 
  it enables companies to sue governments when they feel they are being treated unfairly . 
  in most countries this can already happen , but for many it 's a step too far to allow foreign companies to sue governments . 
  it is thus a very controversial chapter . 
  this proposal by australia and new zealand would completely circumvent systems like these . 
  the us is n't even involved . 
  the state , which used to spend money on the churches , but not anymore . 
  this is what the turks are saying , they get no say over it , this is just wishful thinking . 
  let 's hope the eu does n't actually give them this though , they 've already been blackmailed enough by turkey . 
  again an outstanding piece of investigative journalism from bellingcat . 
  that 's not particularly efficient either , could you imagine the amount of work hours that would take ? 
  not to mention the healthcare costs for the back pain these people are going to develop doing this kind of work !, 
  as usual , the germans had the right idea , put them in camps , exploit them for labour if applicable and then end them efficiently . 
  damn , i must have missed this twist , do you have a source for that ? 
  yes , i am aware that this happened , but what is it in retaliation to ? 
  people in the comment sections of / r/worldnews need to see this . 
  the beginning seconds of this video claim that the destruction of the bridge was in retaliation for something . 
  what was this in retaliation to ? 
  estonia asked this question starting a few years ago , with mixed success . 
  i recommend this analysis documentary for a picture of the vulnerability and inherent flaws of such a system : short rundown : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iit5wdlywns hour-long lecture : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy_phvhe4os, 
  they already basically are , along with countries like poland that are actually willing to field relatively large armed forces . 
  germany is still stuck in their post-war trauma , spain does n't even spend 1 % of their gdp on the armed forces and italy is neat , but not quite there . 
  what is an anti-aircraft ? 
  is it like a submarine , like it does n't fly so hard it flies underwater ? 
  going this far for a story is quality investigative journalism regardless of bias . 
  too bad it turned out to be false though . 
  interesting , but it does create a bit of a `` rich get richer '' situation , do n't you think ? 
  thanks for explaining . 
  i drive diesel myself too , but luckily it 's from 2004 . 
  well damn , i never thought i 'd upvote the sun , and that clickbaity headline does n't help either , but that 's some quality investigative journalism .

  the entire conflict is 50 % active duty russian soldiers , it 's ridiculous that russia still gets away with denying it all . 
  imagine what could be done with all that money ... 
  i do n't know what the situation is where you 're from , but aside from equal time on public broadcasting , political parties get nothing from the government . 
  it has an inherent conflict of interest , the government could far too easily fund the party they 're from themselves to secure future victory . 
  all funding is from membership fees and donations . 
  so , unmodified coal-fired power plants ? 
  of course it 's not the church 's fault , it 's their goal . 
  i just think that it 's very important that the government does n't support one ideology over another . 
  private funding is fine because people themselves decide what to do with their money . 
  but i for one do not want my tax money spent on this . 
  that 's great , but they do n't deserve government funding for doing that , without even mentioning they 're spreading an ideology . 
  so , why do poland and romania and such produce so much of this ? 
  is this really producing so much pollution or is this a joke ? 
  what ? 
  this sounds good , what business does a government have aiding churches anyway , that 's not very secular . 
  what are these ? 
  from wikipedia :  benzopyrenes are harmful because they intercalate into dna , interfering withtranscription . 
  they are considered pollutantsand carcinogens . 
   germany 's thomas de maiziere , in brussels for a meeting of eu interior ministers , said he expected proposal from the eu executive due on dec. 15 to include giving responsibility for controlling a frontier with a non-schengen country to frontex , the eu 's border agency , if a member state failed to do so . 
  so , basically greece ? 
  edit : must have missed this post : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3vedsc/greece_accepts_eu_border_help_under_schengen/, 
   `` nato is a product of the cold war '' no you !, 
  this basically is what it 's doing right now .

  no , it 's about [ raptors ] ( http://images.military.com/media/equipment/military-aircraft/f-22-raptor/f-22-raptor_009.jpg ) . 
  what are you on about ? 
  is that a quote by the anti-anti-fascists ? 
  this looks like it could leak easily . 
  edit : darn , secure reading room . 
  the source of this is [ rottenwifi ] ( http://rottenwifi.com/map ) , which is a great project for figuring out the quality of wifi over at venues or hotels and such , but is lacking a lot of data for these results to be considered trustworthy in my opinion . 
  just looking at the map zoomed out will show huge discrepancies between countries in the number of tested wifi networks , with lithuania having a whopping 4267 networks , but france only having 335 . 
  in fact , i 've made a chart you can view [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lw85dl7.png ) to show just how large the discrepancies are . 
  build a fence in the sea !, 
  well , show it then !, 
  plastic dongs . 
  turkey is n't even in schengen , greece just ca n't enforce it 's border , they need to build a fence !, 
  it 's a bit of both . 
  it 's not going to turn any tides , but they 're basically flying radars with cameras attached , you ca n't really have enough of those .
