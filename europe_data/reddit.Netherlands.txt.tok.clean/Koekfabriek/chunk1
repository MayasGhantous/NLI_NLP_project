i think / u/eireannsian means ww1 , the netherlands did not partake in that one . 
  yeah it often coincides which is very logical . 
  ( conservative christians use the bible as basis of their worldview . 
  but even this has nothing to do with the idea of separation of church and state . 
  that is based on the idea that a nation no longer has one official church as the official german/dutch/france etc church which gave their members benefits and the non-members had disadvantages . 
  separation of church and state basicly says : the church ( as an national organization ) does not interfere with nation politics and vice versa . 
  it does not mean , ideas based or partly based on biblicals ideas are forbidden in national politics . 
  that conservatives are '' blocking '' gay marriage is a part of the democratic proces , their opinion is just as '' valid '' as being pro gay-marriage . 
  a christian party is not '' the church '' and has nothing to do with the separation of church and state . 
  thanks for this reaction and i understand your position . 
  but why is an attack on a church '' * random local news * '' . 
  while i see on hot : [ 2 men killed by bull in spain ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20150625/two-spanish-men-die-after-being-gored ) , [ giant penis in norway ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b7sby/theres_a_giant_penis_in_norway_going_around/ ) , [ greece is fastest growing champagne market ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11699599/greece-is-the-worlds-fastest-growing-champagne-market.html ) , [ norway 7 year old can now change gender ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b6rkj/norway_to_let_7yrolds_change_gender/ ) . 
  why is that not '' * random local news * '' ? 
  but what is the definition of informational value ? 
  for me an islamic attack on a church is a something i like to know . 
  just i would like to hear and discus an anti-semic attack on a synagogue etc. 
  i really do n't understand why news items on islamic attacks fall under * islamphobia * and should not be allowed . 
  let the community vote on what we want to see on hot , democracy and everything . 
  of course in dutch though , [ dutch mp ] ( https://twitter.com/joelvoordewind/status/613337245567815681 ) from the * christenunie * ( christianunion party a leftwing christian party ) is asking question in the [ dutch parlement ] ( https://twitter.com/joelvoordewind/status/613330645687881728 ) . 
  populair dutch website * geenstijl * ( a conservative/rightwing website ) has an article [ here ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2015/06/godsdienstoorlog_op_het_azc.html ) . 
  the problem is not new , already in 2010 there where a shitload of articles about this problem . 
  the biggest dutch newspaper * de telegraaf * ( conservative newspaper ) has an article [ here ] ( http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/article21047815.ece ) . 
  they wanted to give the 2 christian guys a different room . 
  you know , that solves the problem !, 
  i would call that national attention . 
  dont know if you can read dutch , but you can see [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/joelvoordewind/status/613330645687881728 ) a dutch mp from a left christian party ( cu ) saying he is going to ask the government about this problem . 
  happy ? 
  watched it quick but this is the case : muslims pray in the public kitchen , during prayer non-muslims are not allowed in the kitchen . 
  this is not allowed according to coa , it is a public room after all . 
  room with 3 people ( 2 christian including the filmer , 1 muslim ) . 
  muslim prays in the room , they are forced to keep quit , they want to talk about that because is is their room not his room . 
  warns them that : '' they will see what happens in a few days . '', 
  when leaving the room ( to go pray ) keeps on playing some kind of arabic music trying to convert the guys . 
  talks about that a lot . 
  when they disagree with something in the coa the muslims gets angry . 
  not allowed to use the fridge in the room , because their meet is not halal . 
  other muslims knock on their door to wake them up for prayer ( also in the night ) . 
  never . 
  the netherlands used to have 4 big '' parties '' ( this was in the beginning of the 20 century ) protestant , catholic , liberal ( our torries ) and socialist.it was a trade between the major parties to have equal representation , funding for christian schools ( used to be private ) and voting rights for woman . 
  roughly : the christian parties wanted funding for the christian schools , the liberals wanted equal represantation ( they where spread out the most ) , and the socialist wanted women voting rights . 
  as [ proper dutchmen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polder_model ) they decided to have it all at once, 
  yes , and i hope we get it back fast . 
  it was proper [ money ] ( http://afiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/guilders.jpg ), 
  ca n't read the article because it is in spanish , so i could be wrong here . 
  but * illegal * immigrants building a * illegal * settlement . 
  and then the morrocan police enforing their law . 
  that does not make you a xenophobic racist . 
  dont know , once every generation seems fair to me ( let 's say 20 to 30 years ) . 
  the eu as a original plan seems great to me , but the way to more federalism i can not support . 
  i would love to see referenda everywhere in europe . 
  and let 's say all the nations vote for the eu as it is know , then there is legitimacy to continue . 
  you ca n't pretend to be a democratic heaven in the world but on the other hand fearing what the population decides ( for whatever reason ) . 
  i would like to think so . 
  the eu is/pretends to be a democratic union of member states . 
  if one of the members decides ( by referendum or thourgh other democratic decisions ) to leave the eu . 
  it should be accepted by the eu and the government of that nation . 
  pratice what you preach . 
   as if muslims can be racist can you please explain this . 
  so being against * illegal * immigration makes you a xenophobic racist ? 
  good to know . 
  good , let the people decide . 
  i sadly have to agree with this opinion . 
  i still think there should be a '' place '' in europe for genuine refugees . 
  but we need to be far stricter against immigrants ( also 2nd/3th generation ) who are causing trouble . 
  yes . 
  but there where always ( close ) ties between the afrikaners and the dutch especially if you are looking at the churches . 
  zeeuws , a province of the netherlands called zeeland ( it is the '' old '' zeeland the made new zealand '' new '' ) . 
  i had no idea how to translate it properly so i just wrote the dutch version . 
  for more information see [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zeeland ), 
  i do n't see myself as a european . 
  i am dutch outside of the netherlands and consider myself ~ ~ zeeuws ~ ~ zealandic within the netherlands . 
  of course there is some overlap between the other nations in europe but a european identity ? 
  no , i feel closer related to the boers in south africa then to the spanish or the french . 
  it is more that whole western culture/values ( frome ancient greece to now ) to which i relate then a european identity . 
  i am against using too much english in the netherlands , how much i hate not being able to use english in let say france . 
  i understand that they want to protect their language , and i wish we would do it more . 
  i dislike seeing our customs getting '' burried '' under some anglo-saxon traditions . 
  i oppose the lose of sovereignty we as a country have right now , and i hope that the eu would stop trying to be a politcal union . 
  the flag of the eu means nothing to me , i do n't care about brussels as the capital of the eu . 
  i dont know one european symbol on which i can relate . 
  i consider myself a dutch , white , christian male from a western culture . 
  i do n't consider myself a european and i think i never could/would . 
  but the government did not take this position because the wanted to be open . 
  they where '' forced '' by journalist who requested the information based on a dutch law called wob ( which gives civilians the right on government information ) . 
  a few days ago a document leaked to [ rtl nieuws , in dutch ] ( http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/politiek/geheim-verslag-uitgelekt-nederland-wist-van-luchtdoelraketten-mh17-1 ) , which stated that the government knew that there where ani-aircraft weapons in the area . 
  something the government denied 2 months earlier . 
  journalist pieter klein from rtl nieuws keeps filing more request for information but he keeps on getting denied , the government seems to '' need '' more time . 
  do n't be to impressed , all the important information is censored . 
  what do french people know about beer ? 
  so if i get stopped by a police officer who is black i can say : '' sorry i do n't think you understand me , because i am white . 
  can you please send a white male protestant police officer ? '' . 
  that is not reasonable that is just plain stupid . 
  you can request a different judge because he could be biased based on family relations/work relations etc. 
  not because he has a different skin colour/religion/gender . 
  so if we are going to do it this way are we going to make the police departments almost fully ethnically dutch in regions where the populations is almost fully ethnical dutch ? 
  are we hiring officers in the bible-belt based on their conservative christian background ? 
  can i request to interact with an officer who has the same background as me , or else i am dealing with somebody who is less effective ? 
  the whole idea of hiring people based on gender/colour/background is bullshit/racist/sexist . 
  it is bullshit , you hire people for their skill . 
  not because of their background .
