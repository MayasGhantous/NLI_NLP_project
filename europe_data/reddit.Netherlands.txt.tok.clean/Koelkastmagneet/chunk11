  that 's a bit different than racial caricatures . 
   according to the report , erdo\u011fan 's `` three-step project '' aims to bring up `` world-class it experts , programmers and software developers '' by taking scandinavian countries as model , particularly estonia . 
   by taking scandinavian countries as model , particularly estonia . 
   ** scandinavian ** countries  ** estonia ** what, 
  i 'd say the armenians ( if they count as europeans ) still have you beat . 
   turkey did not - let me repeat - did not bully cyprus . 
  turkey pushed for the ridiculous cypriot constitution , turkey pushed for enosis to be denied , turkey funded the tmt , turkey threatened invasion half a dozen times . 
   but i know what you will say you will typically blatantly like a true westerner oh wow . 
   deny what i have written and wont even click those sources . 
  let 's go through them . 
  eoka was formed in response to the fiercely anti-democratic settlement the uk and turkey had forced on cyprus . 
  part of cyprus being an ungovernable mess was because turkish cypriot policy makers were in effect turkish political agents . 
  the akritas plan was , once again , a response to the ridiculous cypriot constitution . 
   in the end turkey will be evil and greeks will be innocent . 
  because how can evil barbarian turks be victim ? 
  how typical for you ... trotting out the old victim mentality again , eh ? 
  quality response , just about what i 'd expected . 
  ... yes ? 
  your point being ? 
  propose the argument was different ; a greek cypriot would be arguing that nothing happened and that there was no intercommunal violence prior to turkey 's invasion . 
  would i have no basis for arguing against that because he 's a cypriot and i 'm not ? 
  they accepted annan but pushed forward idiotic provisions that would let them basically keep their troops there as long as they 'd like , which was part of the reason why the greek cypriots rejected it . 
  it was turkey that pushed for a constitution that guaranteed excessive privileges for a minority in a way that would guarantee conflict , it was turkey who helped stir up trouble through the tmt , it was turkey that pushed for cyprus to not get a say on enosis . 
  it was intercommunal violence , not one-way violence . 
  besides , this is all a moot point . 
  turkey went far beyond the ( ridiculously excessive ) rights that it had as a `` guarantor power '' . 
   so , you are saying that greek cypriots suffered more because their population was larger than the turkish cypriots ? 
  well , i would use percentages for this . 
  i would use absolute terms when one population had literally more than three times the victims , but fair enough . 
   and - i 'm not saying anything against this but well , we know why the intervention , which became the invasion , had happened . 
  the situation as it was , was already in large part turkey 's fault though . 
  and greek cypriots were being murdered by turkish cypriot militias stirred on by turkey . 
  cyprus got screwed out of enosis because of turkey 's bullying . 
  cyprus got a constitution that basically guaranteed ethnic conflict ( by privileging the turkish minority ) and denied them their self-determination due to turkish bullying . 
  90 % of this mess is because of turkey . 
  irrelevant . 
  turkey 's invasion was somewhat justified ( because of the idiotic structure of the cypriot constitution ) but the subsequent war crimes , colonization , ethnic cleansing , partition etc. 
  did not . 
  bullshit , there were far more greeks than turks displaced , the turks were not even 20 % of the population , spread around the island and turkey occupied 40 % of the island ( which was majority greek prior to that ) on their behalf and evicted the greek population from it . 
   it 's the same for the cypriots who were evicted or fleed from their property in southern cyprus . 
  caused by * turkey 's invasion * , and they had the greek cypriots ' property given to them . 
  well the invasion and mass displacement happened only forty years ago and he greek cypriots suffered by far the most from it , there are plenty of people alive today who were evicted from their property in northern cyprus . 
  this is one of the problems of unification plans turning cyprus into a confederation ; it would legitimize turkey 's aggression and its demographic consequences . 
  ... sure ... 
  do they honestly believe that to be a good idea ? 
  i got the impression that the ukrainian army 's performance throughout the war has been unimpressive to say the least . 
  depends on the terms of the reunification i 'd say . 
  if it 's as bad as the annan plan was it could still happen . 
  it 's not because of ` putinists ' , it 's because its an idiotic proposal . 
  finland ca n't cut all economic relations with the country it shares its largest border with and expect to get out of it without horrendous economic consequences . 
  that 'd make for quite a bad argument though . 
  english is an inconsistent language with a lot of pitfalls and weird pronunciation issues . 
  nah , the very worst they 'd likely ask is some adjustments to greece 's eez claims and some issues about ` grey zones ' of uninhabited islands . 
  the guy 's in the opposition , and a socialist to boot . 
  i would n't take too much solace in that though . 
  gdp per capita ( even ppp ) is n't a real good measure of the quality of life . 
  for instance , income ( and wealth ) inequality is much higher in russia than it is in poland , skewing the statistics significantly . 
  yes , thanks for the requisite `` russia did this bad thing once '' post . 
  did korenizatsiya happen ? 
  yes or no ? 
  did soviet ukraine have ukrainian as its own official language and did it have limited autonomy ? 
  yes or no ? 
   even ignoring them , however , you should . 
   the soviet union straight up gave crimea to ukraine as an administrative move . 
  it said `` this is yours '' . 
  then the soviet union ceased to exist . 
  is russia supposed to be able to play ` take-backsies ' on the basis of the ussr 's ` ultimate ' ownership of crimea ( and maybe ukraine as a soviet bound to it ) , is that what we 're all supposed to think ? 
  hogwash . 
  you 're arguing against a position i 've never taken . 
  russia 's takeover of the crimea was certainly illegal but that does n't mean that crimea 's low population of people who identify as ukrainians ( and its incredibly small percentage of ukrainian speakers ) is some result of russian oppression . 
  which is irrelevant and does n't make your earlier lolsofunnyandoriginal comment any less wrong . 
  the post he responded to did . 
  if he was n't talking about the crimea his reply makes no sense . 
  ossetians are n't ethnic russians , dank memes aside . 
  that 's a very selective reading of history you have there . 
  the crimea never had a a very large population of ukrainians ( outside of the khanate 's slaves , if you desperately need to attach a nationality to them pre-19th century ) until soviet times ( and most of them are/were russophone ) . 
  hell , a large part of the reason why ukraine has as many ukrainian speakers ( and russophone ukrainians ) as it does is the soviet korenizatsiya policy . 
  so brave . 
  that 's quite a bold statement you have there , op . 
  the crimean tatars are n't that large a share of the crimean population , at about 10 % . 
  i 'd say it 's quite important given cameron 's promises to tackle immigration . 
  it 's really strange to me that after more than 70 years of communism this great russian mentality of denying belorussian and ukrainian nationhood has just returned overnight . 
  you mean the spanish netherlands ( what was left of it anyhow ) ? 
  for the record , i thought the positive news the first few months after he was elected was a hogwash pr narrative as well . 
  i 'm not the biggest fan of pope francis , i 'm just tired of the constant `` pope francis says thing '' stories . 
  i just do n't quite get what your point is . 
  do you want to force all institutions you have no part or further interest in to push a liberal leftwing agenda ? 
  even if it goes against everything the institution stands for ? 
  big surprise , catholic pope still supports idealized archetype of married loving heterosexual parents . 
  i honestly do n't get the point of all these `` pope francis says [ surprisingly liberal thing/catholic thing/loving thing ] '' posts . 
  the pope is still catholic , big fucking surprise . 
  do people honestly suspect someone occupying that office to be a hyper-leftwing liberal all of a sudden ? 
  i honestly do n't get what non-catholic people are getting outraged at . 
  it 's still relatively safe ( and easy , in comparison with soviet times ) for foreign journalists in russia , most of the outright assassinations have happened to russian journalists and mostly after a long career of anti-government reporting . 
  outright assassinating foreign journalists is counter-productive . 
  the land annexed from poland is now part of belarus and ukraine . 
  poland was a puppet state outside the ussr . 
  you do know waterloo was a pretty pivotal event , right ? 
  it 's not a petty `` fuck you '' to the french , just a commemoration . 
  i 'm real glad for you feeling morally superior to us .
