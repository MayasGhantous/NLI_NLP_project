   he is also the only head of state in the world who denies the crimes of history , notably the massacres of non-muslims by sultan abd\u00fclhamid ii ( the hamidian massacres of 1894-95 -- at least 80,000 christians murdered and 100,000 christians incorporated by force into the harems ) , then by the young turks ( the genocide of the armenians , the assyrians , the chaldeans , the syriacs , the pontic greeks and the yezidis , from 1915 to 1923 -- at least 1,200,000 dead ) yeah , i very much doubt that . 
  for one thing turkey 's ally azerbaijan holds pretty much the same position on the issue . 
  as for him being the only one to deny crimes of history there 's still plenty of western whitewashing of colonial periods , serbia ( together with rs , aided by russia ) has recently actively campaigned for there to not be a genocide recognition for bih . 
  russia 's stance on the circassian genocide/ethnic cleansing of the circassians and the various atrocities of the soviet regime also continues to be ambiguous at best . 
  the putinist sympathies of the author make the whole thing look dubious as well . 
  i think the munich-sudetenland analogy being made is very much a stretch . 
  i very much doubt that erdogan , despite his ambitions of regional dominance , wants to literally incorporate areas full of either kurds or arabs that are only liable to cause trouble . 
  also this ...  in the 1930 's , the elites of europe and the united states considered that the ussr , by its model , threatened their class interests . 
  they therefore collectively supported the nazi project for the colonisation of western europe and the destruction of the slavic people . 
  ... is absolute nonsense only the most deluded of putinbots should ever try to push . 
  this kind of talk also is n't all that new . 
  putin talked about chechen terrorism in 2000 in similarly coarse terms and there 's his [ famed response ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryqrqeetjek ) to a french journalists as well among a myriad of such instances . 
  well for most of the rest of europe russia takes one for the team and plays the bad guy so we can feel better about our neighbors . 
  what are you even saying ? 
  if this is about vojvodina 's ( somewhat nonsensical ) autonomy being revoked you 've misunderstood what i was trying to say . 
  also , neither vojvodina nor kosovo were constituent republics , they were always parts of serbia , regardless of whatever far-reaching autonomy they got . 
  well the bosnian war is much more recent , within living memory , and belgium is n't in some kind of federation with congo like rs is with bih . 
  though the serbs are n't the only ones in the region with controversial heroes . 
  i suspect they have similar objections to some of the people lauded as heroes in pristina and zagreb . 
  serbia 's borders have ... or would all of former yugoslavia disintegrating into its constituent municipalities as mini-states be ok because by that demented logic their borders would n't have changed . 
  that had no prior history as anything other than a part of serbia , was n't a yugoslav republic in itself , and had no right to declare independence until nato decided it did . 
  he said while discussing a separatist entity created by nato bombing . 
   albanian majority regions that are still in serbia is what i meant by those examples . 
  no north kosovo without getting those back . 
  you still ca n't get something ` back ' if you 've never had it . 
   we do give them concessions !, 
  serbs are allowed to run for office and vote . 
  giving them normal citizen rights within a state rife with anti-serb sentiment is n't a concession . 
   they just do n't want to because they feel as if their betraying serbia by participating . 
  it 's their own fault . 
  i 'm sure the serbs said much the same thing about albanians boycotting serbian institutions in the 90s . 
   so we can just do what any government should : tax them and watch how quick they 'll speak . 
  need to control someplace before you can effectively tax . 
   if they refuse to pay . 
  cut off the lights/water . 
  sure , belgrade could supply them that but for how long before it becomes a drain on them ? 
  it 's already a drain on them , on everyone in fact thanks to pristina insisting on dragging it down into misery with them without being able to effectively control it . 
  belgrade wo n't give up on serbs in kosovo without pristina giving anything back , like the near-powerless association of serb municipalities you fear so much . 
   also yes this whole problem started because of military actions that were committed in multiple countries by one specific government . 
  and a violent insurgency started by one specific separatist group which was totally right in their case but a largely nonviolent opposition to pristina 's rule in northern kosovo is obviously wrong because fuck serbs . 
   so going back to what i said in my first post . 
  everyone likes to talk about how much conflict the balkans has , and how nothing works . 
  but the issue is that all the root causes of these tensions can be traced back specifically to one reocurring problem starter ... yup , blame it all on belgrade , blame it all on the serbs . 
  they want to rule without giving concessions to their albanian minority ? 
  partition the country immediately . 
  you want to rule without giving concessions to your serb minority ? 
  well ... it 's obviously because they 're dumb and need to be bullied into submission . 
  albanians good , serbs bad , muh sovereignty . 
  well of course it would but good luck on getting the serbs to give up on what they 've already got guaranteed . 
  a unitary state would be much better for fostering a sense of united purpose , common identity , coexistence and all that good stuff , i very much agree . 
  i just do n't think there 's any easy practical way to get there at this point . 
   not really , presevo and bujanoc would remain in serbia so how would that be fair ? 
  presevo and bujanoc have no history as part of anything ruled from pristina . 
  of course it still would n't be fair , it 'd still require belgrade to officially recognize the loss of most of its province . 
   so the best way to deal with minorities is to not have them ? 
  if they do n't assent to being ruled by you , become a source of smuggling and crime by you insisting on them also not being governed by belgrade , you refuse to give them any real concessions and the only recourse you seem to have in that case is to initiate military action of some sort ... do you remember what this shit started with ? 
   what do you guys think we 're barbaric cannibals who will kill our minorities as soon as the west turns it heads ? 
  what other recourse do you have but military action if you refuse to give them real concessions and they refuse to be governed by you if they do n't get them ? 
   we could also do that without giving up land . . by continuously alienating your serb minority and giving them every cause to fear for their future and look to belgrade ? 
  you 'd effectively give up practically nothing since pristina has never held effective sovereignty over northern kosovo anyhow . 
  i very much doubt an ungovernable bosnia is in the west 's interest . 
  it 's probably just the simple matter of dayton being a definitive deal that needed making within a limited timeframe and as much as it might 've stung for the bosniaks/bosnian croats giving concessions to bosnian serbs was necessary within that framework . 
  what other options does the west really have ? 
  collude with the bosnian government to dissolve rs ? 
  it 's difficult to make the serbs ( or basically any given ethnic group ) give up parallel structures once they 've obtained them and the west already has an image problem for serbs in general . 
  kicking the hornets ' nest by unilaterally dissolving rs and infuriating the serbs more wo n't help anyone . 
  you know they could 've just not bothered with northern kosovo right ? 
  if they 'd have just ceded it back to serbia there would have been no need for parallel state structures ( if indeed the dreaded association of serb municipalities is one of any consequence , it looks like a very minor concession to me and very much limp as far as real authority goes ) . 
  a kosovo without the serb north would also leave kosovo in control of its borders , would significantly cool tensions with belgrade , would halve the serb minority within kosovo thus removing much of the justification for concessions to them and significantly lessen belgrade 's influence within kosovo . 
   albania and the non-eu states of the former yugoslavia - ** 54 characters **  albania , serbia , bosnia , montenegro , macedonia and kosovo - ** 57 characters ** not a huge time-saver i 'm afraid :(, 
   who is saying everything russia touches turns to shit ? 
  [ this very thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4b7hn2/two_years_after_illegal_annexation_of_crimea/d16yfgr )  when the government of a powerful country acts in a reprehensible manner over a series of years ( my personal crossing of the shit-line was the 2008 invasion of georgia , politely overlooking the regimes role in ensuring that conflict stays frozen in the first place ) then people are loudly and angrily going to call it out until it changes . 
  that 's all very well but could you please read what 's written within this thread within the context of this thread ? 
  i am * not * defending russia 's annexation of crimea or its wider role in regional conflicts . 
   no one is saying the average russian is an uruk-hai . 
  and nobody believes you feel that way either . 
   for god 's sakes the americans complained less about this when they got hell from everybody for their shit in iraq and afghanistan . 
  but it is very likely that people responded to ill-informed nonsense on the matter in a very like manner as i 've done here . 
  claiming russia has a role in regional conflicts , that its regime is repressive , and that its annexation of crimea is illegal is * fine * with me . 
  do n't call me an apologetic when i object to blanket statements that have more to do with anti-russian sentiment and being poorly informed than any kind of anti-putinism . 
  any kind of record of such a mass expulsion ? 
  well that 's the thing about the soviet union , it was n't some device for funneling all wealth towards russia ( though moscow did get preferential treatment because it was the showcase capital ) . 
  russia 's resources were in large part used for subsidizing its ` fellow ' soviet republics and the soviet satellite states . 
  of course being forced into using a horrendously inefficient economy did make all of them poorer than perhaps they could 've been , including russia . 
  as a sidenote , there are several european states left outside of soviet/russian control that are far worse off gdp-wise than russia like albania , serbia , bosnia , montenegro , macedonia and kosovo . 
  oh ffs this has nothing to do with apologetics , personally i loathe the putin regime . 
  mordor is a recurring motif in this case because ukrainians made it one which is why i mentioned it . 
  if someone is going to act like everything russia touches turns to hell do n't call me an apologist for trying to bring some sense into it . 
  imagine whatever you want about people you disagree with , i basically do n't care . 
  but for the love of god try understanding a basic rhetorical device . 
  you do know people can live perfectly normal contented lives in russia , right ? 
  despite what some people may tell you not every place ruled by the kremlin immediately turns into mordor . 
  while i agree that western leaders harping on about territorial integrity being violated in ukraine ( as if ` we ' did n't do it as well with kosovo ) is blatantly hypocritical you 've got your timeline and motives wrong with russia . 
  there was no civil war in crimea , nor was there one in eastern-ukraine until russia started it . 
  being sympathetic to the russian pov is ok and trying to view things through that prism can be perfectly helpful in trying to understand a situation but you should n't start parroting russian propaganda . 
  you do know why we 're making this deal in the first place right ? 
  if turkey is genuinely disintegrating ( a big * if * , but still ) far from being a pen for migrants from elsewhere it could become a source of migrants and ( kurdish ) refugees in itself . 
  turkey does n't exist in isolation . 
  the reason you do n't have your coveted visa-free travel in the first place is because it was revoked after military coups in the 80s caused a massive increase in asylum-seekers . 
  there 's some greek ( even pontic greek as well though the song they 're contained in is quite dire ) in there , some bosnian ( or serbo-croatian , or serbo-croatian-montenegrin , or serbo-croatian-montenegrin-bosnian however you 'd like to say it ) , some italian , as well as some macedonian and some french .
