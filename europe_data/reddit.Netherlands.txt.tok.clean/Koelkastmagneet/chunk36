   `` what happened to the turks in the balkans was one of the worst things that has ever happened to human beings , '' says mccarthy . 
  `` it is one of the greatest disasters that has ever been and yet no one knows about it . 
  no one knows anything about it . '', 
  hyperbole much ? 
  germans suffered from massacres and deportations after wwii on a much larger level and barely anyone knows or cares about that either . 
  sometimes the erstwhile oppressors and colonizers have the tables turned on them , it 's tragic and often unfair on civilian populations but to portray it as the original sin without its wider context is misleading to say the least . 
  despite all their hardships the turkish bulgarians were allowed to stay even though they were the product and beneficiaries of colonization and a system of what basically amounted to religious apartheid , which has to count for something . 
  also , their fate is much better than for example that of the bulgarians in turkish thrace just across the border who were eradicated by the turks in 1913 . 
  also somewhat relevant , justin mccarthy himself is basically a [ turkish propaganda-outlet ] ( http://www.mfa.gov.tr/presentation-by-prof_-justin-mccarthy-at-the-tgna-on-_the-reality-of-armenian-issue_-conference-on-march-24_-2005_.en.mfa ) and a known armenian genocide denier . 
  granted . 
  i 'd forgotten him . 
   `` these absurd and deliberate delays not only encourage extremism in the country but also will increase frustration among the citizens of kosovo , '' deputy prime minister and foreign minister hashim thaci wrote on his facebook page . 
  i 'd also imagine they 'd be quite frustrated that their deputy prime minister ( among others ) has massive connections with organized crime or that the kosovan government flagrantly violates its own constitutions by arresting opposition mps without parliamentary approval . 
  or maybe they 're frustrated by the fact that their ` country ' is still the only authoritarian regime west of belarus ? 
  honestly , he 's quite welcome to his own banana republic but it 'd be nice if he stopped blaming others for it . 
   the people who return are usually people who came for economic reasons . 
  1000 of the 1750 asylum seekers that returned are from kosovo . 
  a country that will most likely join the eu within the next decade . 
  unless the eu willfully throws all requirements for membership out the window for the enormous benefits of gaining a near-failed mafia state i would n't count on kosovo being anywhere near eu membership a decade from now . 
  that simply wo n't happen with five eu countries not having recognized kosovo and the simple fact that tying those two things together is n't legally possible . 
  besides , the way things are going right now serbia 's decades ahead of kosovo as far as eu membership progress goes so the scenario in question has no real way of happening unless some disaster randomly strikes serbia . 
  hypotheticals are fun and all but this one is full-on impossible . 
  i 'm not going to waste anymore words on this if you 're going to be deliberately obtuse and set random bewildering requirements for a certain state being an empire . 
  you know , i edited this out because i generally dislike using it and it felt superfluous here anyway but seeing as it apparently is n't :  / s there you go . 
  i demand the turks acknowledge the armenian , greek and assyrian genocides , pay 15 trillion $ in reparations , grant kurdistan independence , cede all of its remaining land to armenia , greece and syria and then they should all go back to central asia where they came from #orthodoxlivesmatter #constantinoplenotistanbul # 1453never5get, 
  yes , that 's the point . 
   you got yours early on , so fuck the rest ? 
  not what i 'm saying . 
  also that 's a weird comment to make considering i 'm commenting on a hypothetical ` what if ' situation and not an actual one . 
  lithuania , finland etc. 
  all have theirs and i 'm not begrudging that in and off itself . 
   might as well get something good out of it , like our and many other countries independence . 
  well good on you . 
   you made it sound like the war happened because of the independence movements , instead of us just taking advantage of the war happening . 
  no , i 'm merely criticizing views like that of / u/neiodas , who argues that wwi is n't a shame because hurray nationalism . 
  well yeah but if we 're being pedantic ( and i so love being pedantic ) nicholas ii was officially an * imperator * not a * tsar * . 
  tsar had n't been the official title since peter i ( who is considered to be the founder of the russian empire , a succesor of the tsardom of russia ) . 
  though it should be noted that the term tsar was still popularly used and nicholas ii ( who was a massive slavophile ) himself vastly preferred referring to himself as tsar . 
  as a further sidenote the emperor 's full title did include several listings of him as ` tsar ' of poland , kazan , astrakhan etc . 
  it 's massively convoluted stuff for two titles that essentially mean the exact same thing . 
  also , while i 'm sure you 're not implying this , the russian empire ( while quite a repressive state by modern standards ) was nothing like nazi germany . 
  millions of dead people , decades long economic-malaise , millions of traumatized soldiers , the decline of europe , the emergence of one of the worst forms of totalitarianism in history etc. 
  no biggie , ` we ' got our own state for some two decades ( that was almost invariably ruled by a dictator ) in between all that so hurray . 
  ` balts ' as in inhabitants of one of the baltic countries , not the ethno-linguistic group . 
  it 's ok for you to hate russians ( i 'd advise against it , it 's somewhat nonsensical but i 'm not one to crusade for moral convictions ) but could you please stop spouting nonsensical ultra-nationalist nonsense where it 's totally irrelevant ? 
  the disenfranchised people of the balkans and eastern europe would still spend most of the century being disenfranchised though . 
  criticize me for wishful thinking but i still think the three great empires of east and central europe had some capacity for reform and however limited that might 've been and however much it would 've still inevitably resulted in oppression i still think the continuation of those empires was preferable to the horrors of nazism and leninism/stalinism . 
  which is a bit of a false choice so to clarify ; i 'd prefer their peaceful dissolution but that would 've been even more unlikely . 
  i think we root our ideas about these things too much in terms of modern-day national-thinking . 
  it 's a great thing to have one 's own nation-state but getting there is painful and most ethnicities still do n't have one . 
  the endless pursuit of such things does more harm than good and creates nonsensical divides ( like serbian , bosnian and croatian supposedly being different languages for example ) . 
  he was n't a good emperor but not a particularly evil one either ( not saying the russian empire was n't repressive , although it had become somewhat more mild since 1906 ) . 
  besides , the long arm of st. petersburg was n't * that * long . 
  the central government was often rather weak ( relatively few government employees and fragile state apparatuses ) and people from some of the more far-flung parts of the empire like in these pictures . 
  muslims for example faced restrictions but also enjoyed relative freedoms such as the recognition of multiple marriages for men or being free from military service ( until 1916 ) . 
  neither did most balts and i do n't see you hating your own people . 
  besides , russian rule was a ( relatively ) good thing for lots of the people documented in these photographs . 
  * the armenians got security from muslim raids , kurdish irregulars and got some semblance of law and order they did n't have across the border . 
  * the central asians were pacified and no longer had to deal with incessant tribal warfare . 
  * the georgians became secure from persians and ottoman incursions . 
  i could go on but this is n't even the point . 
  you 're setting an impossibly high standard for you not to hate these people that even the overwhelming majority of estonians would n't have met at the time this picture was taken . 
   also , isnt it a strecth to call it the russian `` empire '' . 
  since the state was literally called the [ rossiyskaya imperiya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_empire ) ( which directly translates into ... well i 'll be damned : the russian empire ) ... no i do n't quite think calling it the russian empire is that much of a stretch , really . 
   that is sort of a retroactive assessment of a largely agricultural disconnected land . 
   no legitimate reason the have a secession movement in the first place oppression , lack of representation , the supposed autonomy being a joke , subjection to colonization by baku which seriously shifted demographics . 
   the whole region was a powder-keg with the ussr falling apart and in the middle of all the ethnic , religious & cultural tension plus the maneuvering in-between the republics moving towards independence some people think its a good idea to start a mass nationalist movement to transfer nk out of soviet azerbaijan and into soviet armenia the azerbaijani 's could 've also just , you know . 
  let it go . 
  most azeris in the nk autonomous oblast were recent arrivals and they were just 25 % of the population ( less than 4 % in 1924 when it was farcically assigned to azerbaijan by stalin ) . 
   whats even worse is that as far as i can tell there was no reason to do such a reckless and stupid thing armenian 's were not being killed or harmed before the karabakh movement started its push for nk just oppressed and denied the few rights the soviet union supposedly granted them . 
  just subject to azeri colonization that would 've eventually made them a minority in their own lands . 
   and they had the option of moving to armenia if they really did n't want to live in azerbaijan they had the wonderful option to acquiesce to azeri bullying and baku 's colonization and leave a place where armenians had lived and been the majority in for millenia . 
  wonderful . 
   instead the movement decided to light a fire under the powder-keg all the deaths and the the economic harm can all be traced back to whatever idiot 's in the movement decided to make there move at the worse possible time it can be traced back to azeri nationalist twice making a claim to a region virtually bereft of actual azeris because they drank too much of the ultranationalism koolaid . 
  the azeris could 've simply chosen ** not ** to commit pogroms or ** not ** have revoked nk 's autonomy or have simply been decent human beings and let nk go if that 's what the majority of the population wanted . 
  or they could have negotiated if they were that damned attached to the region . 
  fact is , they did n't . 
  they grasped for military means for as long as they thought they could get away with it . 
  the azeris commited pogroms , the azeris denied the armenians self-determination , the azeris instituted the oppression and colonization of armenians . 
  but no , let 's blame the armenians the one time they actually escape ethnic cleansing . 
  those damn armenians who dare not acquiese to bullying and persecution . 
  those damn armenians who wo n't leave their homeland of thousands of years because of the fever-dreams of azeri ultra-nationalists . 
  some armenians advocating for nk being attached to the armenian ssr does n't justify pogroms and when those pogroms started ( and showed no signs of abating ) and azeri armenophobia got underway there was no reasonable way for nk to stay azeri territory with its majority armenian population intact . 
  no halfway respectable country replies to separatism with ethnic cleansing and no halfway respectable country should expect to have territorial integrity respected if it does . 
  advocating for political changes is not a crime , even if it were , the systematic targeting of an ethnic group for pogroms and ethnic cleansing is by far the greater and certainly one that justifies secession by the victimized party . 
  the only reason there 's a * single * armenian left in nagorno-karabakh is because it seceded . 
  sure it was a vicious cycle , and it 's difficult to ascertain whether a serious secession movement started before the pogroms did . 
  but to claim that armenians had no legitimate reasons to secede by 1991 ( when the war properly started ) is ludicrous . 
  heard it here first folks . 
  getting constantly murdered over being an armenian really is n't that good a reason to secede , they should 've just been more tolerant of getting murdered . 
  in fact those pesky armenians should just go ` back ' to armenia if they like living so much , the ungrateful bastards . 
  millennia of armenian civilization in nagorno-karabakh be damned . 
  well that 's the world of post-soviet ( and yugoslav ) ultra nationalism and strongman ` leadership ' for you . 
  it does n't matter if the ` strongman ' in question is a shifty autocratic mafioso that does n't do shit for 99 % of the population as long as he promises the return of the ancient and true lands of our glorious people ( that may or may not happen to be filled with people who hate us for totally no good reason ) because that 's what helps you when you 're living in a near-failed-state . 
  see also the attitude of both early 1990s ukraine and modern-day russia to crimea . 
  you seriously ca n't spare the trouble of doing two seconds of googling for a [ well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kirovabad_pogrom ) [ documented ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sumgait_pogrom ) [ subject ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baku_pogrom ) like azerbaijan 's anti-armenian pogroms ? 
  i 'm not fully with / u/szkwarek on this at all but are you dense enough to disregard how this war started ? 
  there was a very good reason for the armenians of nagorno-karabakh to secede and that was azerbaijan literally murdering them . 
  azerbaijan is not an innocent victim in this . 
  well the bagrationi/bagratids are still around .
