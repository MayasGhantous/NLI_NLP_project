  georgian branch and all but still . 
  not really . 
  it 's inconsistent as shit ( northern cyprus , nagorno-karabakh , western sahara etc. ), 
  but that 's par for the course as far as international attention and attitudes towards israel goes ( which is probably tangentially connected to antisemitism but i digress ) . 
   for example , back in ww1 , french army came to assist serbia when it was being helplessly invaded by the central powers . 
  something that can not be said about russia . 
  ... that 's entirely wrong ... pretty much backwards . 
   are these two nations any lesser `` historic allies '' than russia ? 
  considering the fact that they literally bombed serbia less than two decades ago i 'd say yes . 
  well to be fair on balance russia is probably still ahead as far as net economic benefit goes considering it has n't bombed serbia yet . 
  he 's alluding to a double standard . 
  / u/1905 presumably thinks quite differently about the turks in cyprus than he does about the croats and serbs in bosnia even though the turks are a minority in cyprus and the croats and serbs together form the majority of bosnia 's population . 
  croats and serbs together are a larger part of the population than bosniaks are . 
  why should the majority of the population conform to the ideals of the bosniak plurality ? 
   ah , i forgot , only slavery counts . 
  :-) ... only slavery counts when we 're literally discussing the subject of slavery . 
  you can move the goalposts all you want but you 're literally coming into a discussion about slavery and randomly mention the congo free state for no goddamn reason other than to assert how very moral you are . 
   besides that , i find your comments to be quite immature , the one directed at / u/jamieusa included . 
  well are n't you just so very adult . 
  bravo . 
  sla-ve-ry we are discussing slavery . 
  not colonialism or atrocities in general , just slavery . 
  is it really that difficult to remember ? 
  not a defense , mate . 
  i 'm dutch , not belgian . 
  the congo free state was basically a private enterprise by leopold ii , that 's just a fact . 
  which had nothing to do with slavery , genius . 
  plus , it was the congo free state at the time not belgian congo . 
  it was a private project of king leopold ii , the belgian state stepped in only after it came to light just how horrific leopold ii had run things . 
  eh , his experiences are valid . 
  if he hates the thing and feels it dehumanizes black people and that it personally hurts him i do believe that 's how he experiences it . 
  stuff like this though :  they live in a country literally built on the backs of oppression . 
  yeah ... it literally was n't . 
  i know this is hard for people whose entire conception of their own identity is their skin color but slavery really was n't * that * lucrative or important an institution for anyone but a select few . 
  it made some select people very rich but the country itself and its development still leaned very heavily on ... you know the people of the particular country . 
   slaves were used in the colonies by every colonizer at some point . 
   we had to deal with it more directly because our slaves are ** now valued citizens . 
  ** ...  p.s. 
  the government not allowing slaves in europe but allowing them in colonies is no better than anywhere else . 
  i 'm not arguing the morals of either but there being no slaves within the actual netherlands ( or france , great britain ) is a significant difference . 
  there were n't masses of disenfranchised blacks until they started ( voluntarily ) immigrating to european countries . 
  belgium did n't , it only even gained independence in 1830 . 
  plus slave trading is different then having slaves within your country . 
  slavery was pretty much illegal in the vast majority of colonizer states throughout europe since before the period of colonization . 
  you 're welcome to comment on these things but could you please do the tiniest bit of researching first ? 
  sort of . 
  if dutch black people have an issue with it and feel that it promotes negative stereotypes then i do think we need to have a serious discussion on accommodating their concerns . 
  that said i do n't think the debate should be shaped by what the rest of the world feels about it . 
  if anything this attitude of ` oh whatever will the rest of the world think when they see this ' and the shockingly ignorant commentary that 's been dumped upon us as a society ( `` why do you need two santas '' ) has led to a sort of nativist backlash and renewed attachment to the whole celebration . 
  but the people who protest this shit by harassing and screaming at kids during an innocent celebration can go fuck themselves . 
  yeah that certainly is hilarious considering azerbaijan 's treatment of armenian cultural heritage , the fact that azerbaijan committed a series of pogroms not even 30 years ago and the fact that azerbaijan literally denies entry to their country if they happen to suspect you of the grievous crime of being of armenian descent . 
  but honestly though , that really is n't even his [ best ] ( https://twitter.com/presidentaz/status/558526288613220352 )  no-one is prosecuted or arrested for a critical opinion in azerbaijan . 
  [ tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/presidentaz/status/554896802806120448 ) . 
   the shipyard in azerbaijan already produces ships . 
  he is , but focusing on the demographics of only nagorno-karabakh itself is somewhat disingenuous . 
  armenia and the nkr have occupied several parts of azerbaijan proper ( that mostly had a neglible population of actual armenians ) around the nkr and cleansed azeris out of it . 
  although it should be mentioned that azerbaijan did the exact same thing to any armenian population under their control and the conflict itself was partly caused by anti-armenian pogroms within azerbaijan . 
  i do n't begrudge you your heroes but turkey 's secularism has hardly been a resounding success considering the ultra-nationalism it caused , the minorities it 's destroyed and the repeated military coups you 've had . 
  having either a cult of personality or being a theocratic hellhole is a false choice . 
  there 's nothing in history that prevented turkey from developing into a better society than it currently is . 
  battles are pretty straightforwards in that regard and russia won the vast majority of them against the ottoman empire . 
  do n't turn history into a caricature . 
   other than that , yeah , ww1 sucked for us . 
  at least we found atat\u00fcrk cuz of it !, 
  because if one thing is healthy it 's an obsessive cult of personality over a man like atat\u00fcrk . 
  nothing to brag about on the turkish side either . 
  i 've seen turkish nationalist somehow claim victory over russia in wwi ( some doing it right now in response to that poster tweet ) even though the russians consistently won and occupied the vast majority of turkish armenia and even trabzon . 
  the only reason turkey got away with territorial gains in the east is because the russian empire collapsed ( similar to the way the german empire did in 1918 ) and their troops subsequently left . 
  after that the bolsheviks fooled themselves into thinking turkey would make a good ally and partitioned armenia with them . 
  the point i 'm trying to make is that pop-history has constructed a narrative on russia in wwi that is almost a caricature . 
  the truth is that russia mostly put in a decent effort until it collapsed for similar reasons that germany did in 1918 and france nearly did in 1916 . 
  they won pretty consistently against the ottoman empire and austria-hungary . 
  russia in wwi really was n't half as terrible as people on the internet ( and pop history in general ) pretend it was . 
  i think fp are extrapolating a bit too much here . 
  the russian orthodox church is condoning the war but much more in the sense of it being a [ ` just war ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just_war_theory ) rather than a holy one . 
  i 'd chalk this up to journalistic sensationalism . 
  you ok there buddy ? 
  you seem a little overexcited . 
  also :  your society is a den of oligarchy , murder , alcoholism , rape , ** xenophobia ** , corruption and drug addiction , in a recession to boot . 
  the russian nation , with all its culture and greatness , died in 1918 . lol, 
  yeah the majority of these literally are n't a thing outside of / int / . 
  have about as much of a viable separatist-movement and own national identity as mecklenburg-vorpommern . 
   soviet government was not stupid ( may be crazy , but not stupid ) and returning crimea back to ukraine was pure economic decision . 
  well calculated decision , by the way . 
  it really was n't , intra-ussr borders were basically meaningless until the ussr disintegrated . 
  crimea did n't benefit economically one bit by being separated from russia and attached to ukraine . 
  it was khrushchev being his usual boorish self and disregarding everything but his personal liking for ukraine . 
  it was n't but to / r/europe history is n't really history if you ca n't put some anti-russian spin on it . 
  it 's pretty much technically correct . 
  the crimea had pretty much no history as part of a ukrainian state apart from it briefly being claimed by various ( failed ) ukrainian states in the wake of brest-litovsk . 
  it 's possible to oppose putin but still refrain from blatantly falsifying history . 
  could we please stop with incessantly drawing inane historical parallels ? 
  our world is ** vastly ** different than that of late antiquity to the point that historic parallels are absolutely useless beyond generalities . 
  even on issues that do have some sort of historical parallel like immigration the issues with it are vastly different . 
  immigration is a much different issue for a social-democratic welfare state than an empire of late antiquity . 
  we do n't have an issue with roving peoples carving out polities on our territory , rome did . 
  we have an issue with social cohesion and welfare costs , rome did n't . 
  rome mostly did n't care about the social welfare of its citizens and their sense of belonging , we do and we should . 
  rome did n't care for what languages their subjects spoke , we do and we should . 
  yup .
