  sort of . 
  you can dispute it a whole lot . 
  macedonian nationalism was a thing , though still fairly obscure at that time . 
  one historian i 've read claimed that until relatively recently prior to the balkan wars macedonian slavs really did n't have much of any sense of nation , either serb or bulgarian , and still predominantly identified as ` christian ' if anything , and that it was the bulgarians agents turning up in macedonia earlier than serbs that caused bulgarian nationalism to really take off in the region for a time .

  to what end ? 
  the situation greece is in means that much of their maneuvering as far as policy-making goes has effectively been taken from them if they do n't want to make some serious long-term sacrifices . 
  syriza had bought into their own ideology to the point that they thought they could just tell the eu that the situation was unsustainable and that they 'd understand that and then the eu would sacrifice but that was always delusional to begin with . 
  what could a popular uprising do ? 
  put a new government in place that will refuse to pay as a matter of principle and thus default on their debt ? 
  how would greece as a state function after that ? 
  odds are it would collapse . 
   world socialist website  published by the international committee of the fourth international ( icfi ) hmmm . 
  forgive me but i very much doubt trotskyists have much of any worth to say on any topic whatsoever . 
  thanks for the propaganda , al-jazeera . 
  i hope your petty-despot master is pleased . 
  also :  evoking memories of the ottoman carve-up of the medieval kingdom of hungary , ** which empowered the peasantry ** but destroyed the ruling class .

  it was literally right beneath my original comment when you replied . 
  [ oh hi ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mxr4c/a_visual_analysis_of_john_olivers_video_about/cvj8w0j ) thanks for implying i do n't understand basic terms though . 
  explicitly not implying / r/europe is a quality sub but ok . 
  not doable . 
  their retarded sectarian wars inevitably become our problem though . 
  unless you want a continuous stream of refugees we have to at leas try to put a stop to the syrian civil war . 
  every single english language thread i come across on / r/turkey is rife with either the same old persecution complex , anti-armenian/greek bullshit , ultra-nationalist nonsense , or an obsession with the word ` butthurt ' on the level of a 12 year old boy . 
  like [ this cesspool ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/3mxwdg/russian_armenian_troops_hold_annual_drills/ ) on their front page right now . 
  i 'm not amazingly happy with the state of affairs in / r/europe but i still think it 's preferable to that shithole . 
  quality subs there in the positive . 
  / r/turkey , / r/anarchism , and / r/socialism ? 
  wow . 
  honestly , to be in disagreement with the general opinion in those shitholes only makes me more convinced i 'm right . 
  though i guess that 's the point of reddit echo chambers . 
  not the sharpest tool in the shed , are you ? 
  it 's the same basic concept . 
  lithuania annexed memel and renamed it . 
  now all the germans are gone , though not by lithuania 's hand . 
  renaming and giving back memel anytime soon ? 
  edit : jesus christ are you people not getting the point . 
  using a name 70 years out of date just to be edgy and anti-russian seems kind of dumb to me , sorry . 
  this argument has come by here about 50 times already and it 's still absolute nonsense . 
  it 's already been proven many times over that immigrants from non-western countries are an economic burden , as well as a social one . 
  they cite [ a paper ] ( http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2438552 ) that notes a net-positive for all immigration as opposed to a * hypothetical closed borders scenario * which no one is advocating . 
  the paper in question does not cover countries of origin and does n't distinguish between them . 
  it weighs the effects of all immigration and takes no consideration of the fact that syrians are n't poles . 
  the paper in question also contains passages like this :  fourth , the presence of a redistributive welfare state makes immigration less attractive to natives . 
  it turns a positive aggregate gain into a negative one in 6 out of 20 countries . 
  or this  however , in austria , belgium , germany , luxembourg , the netherlands , sweden and switzerland native welfare falls . 
  in all these cases , welfare gains turn negative due to the redistribution , so that general redistribution plays a bigger role than unemployment benefits . 
  non-western refugees are n't a boon , at least not for the netherlands . 
  they mostly speak broken english if that and no dutch . 
  when they do have diplomas they are n't recognized as valid here . 
  after twelve years here only 52 % of people granted asylum will have a job . 
  18.5 percent of non-western foreign-born citizens are on jobseekers allowance ( as compared to 8.5 for native dutch ) . 
  that particular statistic is even worse for former refugees . 
  of all working refugees that came here between 2000 and 2010 , 32 % had a job of a maximum of 12 hours a week . 
  just 34 % had a full time job . 
  of the syrians who came here before the refugee crisis 42 % were on benefits as of january 1st , 2013 and there 's no reason that we 're getting significantly more intelligent or employable people today . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/archives/images/wat_kosten_asielzoekers_nou_png.html ) , in dutch ) i could go on for quite a while , but the point i 'm trying to make is that we 're being humanitarian by taking these people in , we 're not doing ourselves a favor , we 're doing the refugees a favor . 
  trying to do the right thing should begin by taking a sobering look at the costs , not by selectively quoting studies and blinding ourselves with idealistic nonsense . 
  some obvious jibes to the supposed irony of people massively fleeing * to * germany . 
  he pretty much is . 
  last week tonight is seems to be a pretty decent show but the formula for pretty much every topic seems to be : `` look at those people not being free-thinking liberals like you and me . '', 
  * lame joke * `` if these people were free-thinking liberals like you and me everything about this situation would turn out great ! '', 
  * pithy appeal to liberal principles *, 
  do n't forget that you guys have an election threshold of 5 % . 
  so if a bunch of parties each get less than that its theoretically possible for a party that got a minority of the vote to get a majority of the seats . 
  theoretically it would be possible if there were a couple dozen small parties who each got less than whatever figure would be required to gain a seat ( i.e. 
  get less than 0.67 % of the vote in the netherlands ) .

  what are you even talking about ? 
  these are unesco sites , he did n't make up a random list . 
  secondly only seven on the list are armenian , five of them being actually in armenia . 
  there are eleven there that have fuck-all to do with armenia , three of which are in azerbaijan . 
  also hilariously clumsy insert there with agdam , great job . 
  if you want to moan about evil armenians find an appropriate , relevant topic first , ok ? 
  also the fact that if he did indeed get elected his extremist uncompromising maximalism would likely make sure the republican majority in both houses of congress would stonewall him to an even further degree than they have obama ( and will clinton ) . 
  i mean it 's not like the republicans have been reasonable or anything but putting a man into office that is the antithesis to what they believe in and somehow expect them to cooperate fully with his relative extremism is a surefire way to get absolutely fucking nothing done ( not to mention that a lot of those millenials who supported him would probably not bother to turn up at the midterms in 2018 and thus exacerbate the issue by once again handing the republicans massive overrepresentation , though this has of course happened in 2010 en 2014 as well ) . 
  to be fair in the first quote i think he was specifically referring to the judiciary rather than justice in a more broad sense of the term , and in the second quote he was n't specifically attacking german courts but systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by turkish germans in german society ( though the ` no rights at all ' is a tad bit melodramatic ) . 
   long before that russia took serbia 's side in the 1885 war , ordering its officers to abandon the bulgarian army ( which at that point was 6-7 years old ) , and after that organised a coup against the bulgarian ruler , and then another failed one against the bulgarian regency . 
  again , i 'm not saying russia was always a friend to bulgaria or was ever disinterestedly devoted to her well-being . 
  russia 's attitude was essentially domineering and she always tried to keep a balancing act between serbia and bulgaria and ultimately ended up supporting serbia over bulgaria most of the time . 
  i 'm simply refuting the notion that russia never once tried to support bulgaria when it 's quite clear that she very much tried to after the first balkan war . 
   thanks for that help . 
   not russian but ok .  how can one hand something over if it 's not in his possession ? 
  what are you even trying to say ? 
  serbia had vardar macedonia in their possession , initially refused to budge to bulgarian pressure , and after severe russian pressure accepted arbitration . 
  russia very much tried to help bulgaria after the first balkan war . 
  it had pretty much forced serbia into russian arbitration over vardar macedonia , which serbia was refusing to partition as agreed upon with bulgaria pre-war ( because the forced creation of albania worked to the detriment of serbia 's prospective territorial gains ) . 
  serbia had accepted arbitration and would 've likely handed over a significant portion of vardar macedonia to bulgaria thanks to russian intervention ( and russia again tried to press serbia over territorial concessions when the entente were trying to get bulgaria to join wwi on their side ) . 
  instead of accepting arbitration however bulgaria invaded serbia and greece even after the russians had extremely strenuously laid out the dangers of doing so ( namely prospective turkish and romanian invasions , which of course happened ) and the fact that it would have no russian support if it came to that . 
  none of this is to say that russia 's attitude was ever one of disinterested selfless friendship or anything but bulgaria 's ( at times ridiculous ) maximalism was n't helpful to itself and to say that russia never once tried to support bulgaria 's interests is patently false . 
  edgy . 
  / r/socialism has more than its fair share of tankies . 
   with barely any terrotory of modern russia [ right ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/kievan-rus-1015-1113-%28en%29.png ), 
  he speaks with what 's supposed to be a heavy russian accent that really sounds more like a polish one . 
   i am stating that they are n't , not that they ca n't be .
