  the disparity in gdp per capita between say serbia and croatia , or poland and germany are within that range . 
  but yes we 're back to [ denying reality ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd/countries/by-ua?display=graph ) and just throwing in nonsense statements like  belarus example proves my point . 
  because admitting that ukraine 's sorry state is largely ukraine 's own fault might just be a tad painful . 
   and much poorer than most of their neighbors who embraced west . 
  'em bracing the west ' is vague nonsense . 
  they fought corruption on their own and had good economic policies which russia was n't preventing ukraine or belarus from doing either , certainly not during the 90s . 
  'em bracing the west ' is not a magical ( nor exclusive ) gateway to good governance . 
  those countries were in a radically different position and had radically different and sometimes better options . 
  ukraine 's oligarchization was n't directed by moscow and actually turned out worse than it was in russia . 
   the closer one is to russia the poorer they are . 
  does n't explain belarus not being markedly better off than ukraine . 
  notwithstanding the gas wars and occasional political meddling the vast majority of ukraine 's pre-2014 problems were caused by its own mismanagement and corruption , which was just as much a problem during the 2004-2010 pro-western period as it was during more ` pro-russian ' administrations . 
  nothing further has been said on the matter since that press release . 
  presumably they 'll take care not to cause any more incidents and the sanction will probably be a proverbial slap on the wrist similar to what azerbaijan got for more grievous rule violations ( vote buying , bribery , arresting azerbaijanis who voted for armenia ) . 
  georgia is n't fun by definition , it 's different and its jarring to have it in there but that 's just because it 's from a sub-genre that 's been dead for about 15 years . 
  huh well fair enough, 
  it 's supposedly historical and you basically only lost on that front with the russians only leaving because of the february revolution , so even if russia were included probably no . 
  has to do with international law . 
  though i 'm sure procedures were violated pretty much everywhere the constituent republics of both the soviet union and yugoslavia were legally allowed to secede from their respective union states . 
  that makes it all sorts of unjust for subject peoples that did n't have their own constituent republics beforehand and thus did n't get to secede but the world sticking to a policy of not willy-nilly recognizing illegal secession serves world stability much better than countries randomly recognizing violent illegal secession because they might feel it to be just in some vague way . 
  i meant dubious value for ` us ' right now , not dubious value for russia . 
  i also think the warm water port shit is overemphasized . 
  russia has foreign interests that are much more realistic and more prudent . 
  russia already has a base in tartus that could be expanded if they cared enough and passage through the dardanelles ca n't be closed as of now anyway . 
  turkey has vital interests that directly collide with russia 's . 
  they 'd have to sacrifice a lot for very dubious gains . 
  russia and turkey are diametrically opposed , turkey would have to sacrifice a lot if they were to side with russia . 
  turkey is an ally of dubious value anyway with its foreign policy considering its occupation in cyprus , blatant disregard for greek sovereignty , blockade of armenia that serves to push it completely into the iran-russia camp , mishandling of the kurdish question , adventurism in syria etc. 
  the press conference ? 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhib_vd4uvw ) , relevant bits at 20:45 and 42:15 . 
  came up during the press conference as well . 
  iveta made a nice miss universe speech about it when it came up , and when it was time for questions for azerbaijan an azerbaijani journalist took the opportunity to go on a tirade about it as well . 
  delicious top-tier eurovision drama there . 
  not the first time either , there 's even a [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenia%e2%80%93azerbaijan_relations_in_the_eurovision_song_contest#2016_contest ) on this shit . 
  make me . 
  uh , yeah . 
  i was agreeing with you . 
  that was what i was referring to ; the un resolutions being presented dishonestly . 
   because its something left in the past ? 
  it was meant to illustrate how this conflicts riles up nationalist sentiments . 
   according to your logic , i can say `` turkey should hold onto northern cyprus just in case greece tries to take the island again '' ... not really  `` jews should stay away from germany because they 're likely to get killed there '' again , not really . 
   both tansu ciller and his party are completely irrelevant today , why should his quote be relevant ? 
  \\* her * party ( though i suppose this speaks as to how irrelevant she and her party are  ) and it is n't about turkey 's politics specifically . 
  it 's about how these things escalate . 
  i 'm not particularly blaming turkey or absolving armenia in this case , nor am i saying armenia always needs to fear war and genocide from turkey and that armenia and turkey can never have cordial relations , just illustrating how this conflict has the potential for escalation . 
  not justifying it . 
  i just do n't think equivocating nk with abkhazia , south-ossetia , donetsk , luhansk etc. 
  is either honest or helpful . 
  ... yes ? 
  what exactly is the issue here ? 
  i put it right within its context . 
  woops , seems i phrased it awkwardly to begin with . 
  i did n't mean turkey was actively threatening to intervene . 
  i meant that within the context of the war turkey momentarily threatened to intervene if nakhchivan was invaded . 
  also here 's [ another citation ] ( http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1993/eirv20n36-19930917/eirv20n36-19930917_036-war_in_caucasus_risks_becoming_i.pdf ) if you particularly need it . 
  what i meant to illustrate by it was that the war inflames public opinion on all sides and has ways of escalating by itself . 
  tansu \u00c7iller threatened intervention in september 1993 should armenia have made a move at nakhchivan . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.academia.edu/22871714/the_discourse_one_nation_two_state_the_position_of_turkey_in_the_nagorno-karabakh_conflict ) p. 36 ( do n't mind the dodgy english , its citations seem mostly okay and wikipedia reports much the same though in that case the citation is a dead link ), 
  you do nothing * at the moment * , policy might change in the future . 
  plus what you actually do or might do is n't quite as relevant as perceptions are . 
  you 'll remember that armenia has a russian base near the turkish border even though the turkish side has long since been demilitarized . 
  plus this conflict has enormous nationalist weight and trauma behind it in all three countries . 
  the actual war caused over a million refugees and turkey openly threatened to intervene if armenia attempted to invade nakhchivan . 
  turkey is very clearly aligned with azerbaijan . 
  you might judge it but to be trivial in practice but the blockade in particular very much hurts for armenia . 
  yeah , the regurgitating of the un-resolutions crap in particular is grating . 
  i very much doubt there 's a real risk of armenia producing nuclear weapons any time soon . 
  wealthier , larger , less isolated countries than armenia have tried before and it took them decades to get anywhere near a practical deployable weapon . 
  if you 'd done a tiny bit of reading up on the conflict you 'd realize that the danger for karabakhi armenians is very real and not a flimsy pretext . 
  i do n't have a great liking for irredentism but just handing back the area to azerbaijan would be a humanitarian catastrophe and the situation is very different from that in ukraine and georgia . 
  someone who does n't share his exact viewpoints who is therefore in dire need of ` denazification ' apparently . 
  [ i saw they had an article about dutch politics . 
  ] ( http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/its-time-to-dismantle-dutch-liberalism-from-within-20170315-0001.html ) it kindly explained to me how in the netherlands we have apartheid and how having integration courses is racist , orientalist , ultranationalist brainwashing . 
  that was fun . 
  modern day moldova is the eastern half of traditional moldavia . 
  when the russians first took what is now moldova and budjak in 1812 there was no traditional name for the eastern half of moldavia . 
  [ the russians took the name of bessarabia from the name of the south-east of moldavia and applied it to the entirety of the territory they had taken from moldavia . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/partitions_of_moldavia.jpg ) after romania retook bessarabia after wwi the soviet union needed an excuse beyond revanchism or irredentism to return to the frontier with romania that the russian empire had had . 
  so it created a [ moldavian assr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavian_autonomous_soviet_socialist_republic ) ( mostly situated on modern-day transnistria ) in the ukrainian ssr after the russian civil war . 
  claiming moldovans as a separate people from romanians the soviet union then demanded bessarabia back from romania in 1940 . 
  it then handed southern third/fourth of it ( budjak ) to the ukrainian ssr , and combined the rest with parts of the moldovan assr to form the moldovan ssr . 
   remember : the kingdom of the netherlands is still a colonial power over the nation states of aruba , cura\u00e7ao and sint maarten , and the country of the netherlands over the three caribbean islands of bonaire , sint eustatius and saba . 
  every single one of these countries and territories have had a referendum wherein independence was an option , except for aruba whose move towards independence was halted by its own parliament . 
  * they chose not to go independent . 
  * that 's not a colonial relationship . 
  yeah , i get what you 're saying . 
  that whole fake controversy with michiel de ruyter a while back just weirded me out . 
  honestly to me there 's something to be said for being more self-critical in regards to our own colonial history and the glorification of rather unsavory historical figures . 
  it 's the blatant hypocrisy of that idea being put forward by a two-faced armenian genocide denying weasel who purposefully panders to turkish chauvinism that annoys me . 
  yup . 
  also a monument to immigration in every municipality , a public holiday to celebrate diversity , the ` decolonization ' of our street names , history education and public memory and the like , a thousand policeman conscripted to an anti-racism taskforce , reeducation courses for people conviced of discrimination , forcing people convicted of discrimination into contact with the group they 've been alleged to have discriminated against , formal apology for slavery and the like * etc. 
  i do wonder that if they were politicians in turkey they 'd propose the same ` decolonization ' there and demand a stop to the glorification of sultans , pashas , grand viziers etc. 
  who were responsible for the slaughter , deportation , oppression , subjugation , slavery , colonization , ethnic cleansing etc. 
  of millions of armenians , greeks , kurds , arabs , bulgarians , serbs , croats etc. 
  somehow i very much doubt it . 
  \\* fun fact : they do name the armenian genocide in their program , but specifically * not * in that context or a similar one . 
  they have a separate bulletpoint for that one where they barefacedly lie by putting victim and perpetrator on the same moral plane , and by claiming there 's significant disagreement among academics . 
  they call for an ` independent ' commission into the ` armenian question ' . 
  which , funnest fact of all , is the exact same weaselly dishonest position the turkish government takes .
