  the d'hondt method [ does * slightly * favor larger parties . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d'hondt_method#allocation ) maybe they read the wiki page and decided that declaring that it ` slightly favors larger parties ' was n't quite dramatic enough for them ? 
  junior partners in a coalition always suffer electorally when partnering with a party on the opposite wing . 
  personally i respect that they took the responsibility to get into government even when they probably knew it 'd hurt them like this . 
  he was always going to lose seats . 
  the 41 the vvd won last time is pretty much the ceiling for a political party these days and the only reason they got 41 last time was because of a perception of vvd-pvda rivalry which caused both leftist and rightwing people to vote tactically in droves . 
  the pvda has * really * been decimated though . 
  they 're down to just 9 seats as opposed to the 38 they won last time . 
  80-20 is an approximation meant to express the idea of the vast majority being well integrated . 
  i believe he should 've expressed that sentiment , but i 'd have preferred he not have named a number like that unless he could back it up . 
  to be fair the 80-20 figure is just a way of phrasing that the vast majority of dutch turks are valuable members of society , good people , loyal to this country etc. 
  and i 'd say it 's a good thing for a pm to express that sentiment . 
  i could detect exactly one phrase in english . 
  they currently have two seats because they defected from the pvda . 
  current polling has them losing one of them so they 'll probably be less off a nuisance than before . 
  plus this whole thing has put them in an awkward position of trying to preach mutual respect , tolerance , reconciliation and all that stuff they 're pretending to stand for while being careful not to alienate their core constituency , turkish nationalists . 
  that of course means they have to bend over backwards to be able to not have to call out erdogan . 
  it 's probably in that light that kuzu has cancelled his debate for tonight . 
  honestly this whole affair is just the umpteenth time they 've been totally delegitimized . 
  [ if this study is accurate the pvv and vvd take in 2 % and 6 % of the turkish vote respectively . 
  assuming every single turkish-dutch person heeds erdogan 's command that would mean a net less of roughly 2600 votes for the pvv and 7800 for the vvd . 
  a party needs roughly 70,000 votes to get a single seat in parliament . 
  also fun ( anecdotal ) dutch article in context : [ rutte 's conduct these past few days seems to appeal to some leftist turks in the netherlands ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/linkse-turk-ziet-opeens-rutte-en-wilders-staan~a4473913/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=shared%20content&amp;utm_content=free ), 
  because denk is just turkish nationalism conveniently disguised as multiculturalism . 
  when a vote was passed on a motion calling on turkey to reconcile with armenia , the text of which contained the term genocide , not only did they loudly oppose it but they called for a one by one vote , and then published a video of it online , highlighting parliament members of turkish heritage who voted in favor of the motion in an effort to name and shame them . 
  they pal around with and apologize for the grey wolves , hamas , and the muslim brotherhood . 
  they have actively defended erdogan 's earlier conduct multiple times . 
  their reaction to this whole incident was to blame our pm and party leaders for ` throwing oil on the fire ' while they have yet to say a word in opposition to any of erdogan 's insults or provocations . 
  this while supposedly calling for reconciliation and mutual respect . 
  yup , they have [ dontfallforit.jpg ] ( http://cdn-02.dagelijksestandaard.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/trap-er-niet-in.jpg ), 
  quick translation : the party denk is pressuring mosque-administrations to convince their congregations to vote denk . 
  that 's what the council of morrocan mosques in the netherlands ( rmmn ) says . 
  it says that several heads of of mosques are receiving such signals . 
  according to candidate-parliamentarian azarkan of denk that is nonsense . 
  he says the criticism is unfounded . 
  because of the `` aggressive style of campaigning '' some muslims would not dare express criticism of denk or would rather vote for another party , according to the council . 
  according to the council denk is polarizing because it constantly talks to voters on the basis of their faith or ethnic heritage . 
  * ` traitor ' * `` the heads of mosques are free if they want to give political parties a platform and there is nothing wrong with that , '' said spokesman said bouharrou on nos radio 1 news . 
  `` but you exceed a limit if you , like denk , insist that they really should vote for you because otherwise they are traitors . '', 
  according to bouharrou denk must stop exercising emotional or social pressure on people so that everyone can on wednesday choose in complete freedom . 
  furthermore he 's taken aback by denk not distancing itself from controversial imams and using fake facebook accounts to besmirch other politicians . 
  `` we call on denk to change her tone , because the issues they are addressing deserve serious attention . '', 
  * muslim yardstick * to help voters , rmmn has prepared a ` muslim yardstick ' , in which political parties are judged on three themes that are important to the council : tackling discrimination and islamophobia , the protection of freedom of religion and the ability to bring people together . 
  d66 , groenlinks and artikel1 score the maximum six points . 
  the pvv and sgp finish last with zero points . 
  denk sits in the middle with four points . 
  it scored well on the first two criteria , but misses according to the rmmn the ability to bring people together . 
  the dutch political party ( nominally-multicultural but mainly turkish and somewhat morrocan ) denk is pressuring moroccan mosques to tell their congregations to vote for them . 
  who hurt you , edizkowicz ? 
  in fairness to him the witchhunt on turkish users on reddit wherein its demanded of them they acknowledge the armenian genocide at any point in time and any setting when called upon or else get ostracized is a little ridiculous . 
  i 'd be the first to criticize the denial or playing down of the genocide but the link to that topic here is extremely tangential . 
  [ here 's denk 's leader 's twitter account ] ( https://twitter.com/tunahankuzu ) . 
  you can use the translate feature and it 'll get the point across . 
  the gist of it is that he 's ( supposedly ) calling for deescalation , mutual respect etc.

  it 's hilarious to see militant erdogan supporters of all people describe a clip that contains a policeman handing out some restrained taps with his baton to get violent demonstrators to move back as somehow constituting police brutality and fascism . 
  well i think i 've got it figured out now . 
  [ the distinguishing ( and only ) feature of fascism is dogs , apparently . 
  i took a stroll through the turkish twittersphere and was amazed at just how much of exactly that type of infantile militarist chauvinism there was . 
  it 's kind of bizarre to be accused of fascism by that type of crowd .

  i did n't actually downvote you though . 
   you do n't seem to realize that the entire issue with zaev a genocide case has everything to do with serbia . 
  yes , the case * itself * has to do with allegations by albanians on serb and yugoslav genocide towards them . 
  * this article * does however not mention serbia and primarily deals with discord between albanians and macedonians within albania over whether or not to press for recognizing it . 
  * serbia itself is neither named , nor does it have any particular direct role in this process . 
  * the point is that this article provides no justification for going on a muh evil serbs rant unless you 're an ultranationalist type who 's purposefully looking for the slimsiest justification to do so . 
   if you follow the hyperlinks on that news article , you 'd be able to see that .

  yeah it 's real bad .

  phrased it awkwardly , i was aware of the context , what i meant was that the link to serbia was tangential at best and the prime issue here is internal macedonian-albanian relations .

  i 'm just getting tired of balkan people doing this thing where they go into a thread and on the flimsiest of pretexts accuse \\* insert terrible enemy people/country here * of being fascist and nazi and whatnot and do a proverbial micdrop . 
  it might 've helped if you 'd actually read the article you were commenting on before going on a brave moral crusade against nazi serbs or whatever it is you think you 're doing here .
