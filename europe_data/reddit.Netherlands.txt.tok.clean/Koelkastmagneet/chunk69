   ca n't you make your point across without talking about armenains ? 
  i spoke of armenians in two contexts both pertaining to a very specific relevant subject which is the blatant double standards you ultra-nationalist types employ and the ridiculous accusation that i was employing them . 
  once i referred to them in a perfectly relevant comparison to show you how ridiculous your accusation of the one guy wanting the turkish cypriots massacred was , and once to illustrate again that for all your accusations of double standards / r/turkey is probably one of the worst offenders in that regard . 
   we were talking about an comment in here and you wrote an entire rant about r/turkey . 
  this thread was posted for the specific purpose of baiting . 
  you people fucking asked for this shit on the twin thread on / r/turkey and [ linked it there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/5jkk3c/turkish_woman_discovering_the_body_of_her_new/dbgye14/ ) . 
  if you want to circlejerk about muh glorious turkiy\u00eb and muh glorious ethnic cleansing you can do it on your containment sub where your views on muh glorious turkiy\u00eb will never be challenged . 
  / r/europe has enough problems with toxic posters without you types coming in . 
   the top comment is literally `` cyprus will never be turkish '' which implies being supporting this kinda of massacres to prevent turks from taking over cyprus or it could simply mean any variation of : * turkey 's occupation of cyprus will never be accepted or recognized * turkey wo n't get away with colonizing cyprus * cyprus ' greek heritage ca n't be erased or something else suitably melodramatic . 
  opposing a state 's political and military control over what 's essentially an ethnically cleansed colony in another country , in whatever melodramatic way you want is n't ipso facto a support for every possible atrocity against the minority population the occupying state is claiming to protect . 
  would you say that every thread on / r/turkey where you melodramatically moan about the armenians being in karabakh you 're being supportive of operation ring , the maraga massacre , and the baku , sumgait , kirovabad pogroms and the ethnic cleansing of armenians in azerbaijan in general ? 
  that 's not even getting into the fact that i do n't agree with what he 's saying anyway . 
  he * might * think the way you 'd presume he does anyway ( to presume it without any evidence however is merely to showcase a ridiculous persecution complex ) , and i think what he said is mightily unconstructive if this were a normal thread , but all things considered it fits in pretty well with the mountainload of melodramatic self-pitying jingoism that the / r/turkey brigade brought in . 
   but fuck that some downvoted to hell guy denied the genocide that 's more important ... downvoted now because the brigade has passed . 
  i have my own issues with the quality of / r/europe but if you do n't want reactionary idiots saying things you choose to take offense to on the internet it 's best not to post a thread in / r/europe promoting your narrative of past events and then proceeding to shit it up with a dozen comments about how everyone hates you , how hateful europeans are , how glorious turkiy\u00eb 's ethnic cleansing was etc. 
  if you do that you 're going to receive crude comments of the same level in turn and you 'll be deserving of them . 
   i swear do you guys ever look at the mirror ? 
  just do it once for me . 
  i 'd advise you to take that comment and save it for the next time you guys on / r/turkey have a thread moaning about pkk terrorism , ` armenian terrorism ' , ` armenian fascists ' , ` armenian whining ' , ` persecution of ottoman muslims ' or whatever . 
  contrast your attitudes on those issues vis-\u00e0-vis the relentless jingoism , justification of ethnic cleansing , and downright neo-colonialism that 's being advocated and defended by you and your ilk in this thread . 
  not really a puppet government . 
  they 're fully dependent on turkey and i 'm quite sure there 's plenty of things they ca n't do out of fear of ankara , but the elections are n't rigged and they 're not directly appointed by ankara . 
  to be fair to that guy this thread opened with a barrage of turkish ultranationalists all moaning some variation of  nobody cares about turks dying :( ( ( ( ( (  glorious turkiy\u00eb took her legitimate rights xdddd butthurt much two-faced euros xddd there 's a guy justifying and glorifying the armenian genocide here right now . 
  ` cyprus will never be turkish ' seems like an attempt at a genuine dialogue in comparison with all this self-pitying and jingoism . 
  it 's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy for dozens of ultranationalists to come in and shit the thread up with their moaning , and then attract a bunch of reactionaries in turn . 
  yes we really should be massively upvoting a thread full of ultranationalists all justifying and glorifying ethnic cleansing and feeling sorry for themselves while exhibiting the worst kind of jingoism , imperialism and pseudo-fascism . 
  was communism really that straight forward ? 
  i 'd very much doubt you 'd be able to smell out each and every radical communist sympathizer or whether you 'd recognize an [ raf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) member on sight . 
  [ the soviet union and its satellites were visible , their violent proxies and agents were n't always . 
  even less visible were communist terrorists and insurgents with no connection to the kremlin or china , of which there were plenty . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/left-wing_terrorism#europe ), 
  sure . 
  but i do n't see a reason why islamist terrorism is fundamentally different from secessionist , fascist or communist terrorism in terms of its lasting appeal or the ways of dealing with it and preventing it . 
  there was a point at which islamist terrorism was a negligible problem and there likely will be again , just as it was with other forms of terrorism . 
  [ parts of the 70s and 80s ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/thumbs/1300x1300r/2016-12/terror20161220-i2.png ) were significantly worse in terms of the number of victims of terrorism than we have now , those years must have felt much the same for people then as these years do to us now . 
  yet secessionist , and ultra-leftwing and ultra-rightwing terrorism faded , as did hatred for those groups whose members had committed these acts . 
  then the revolutions of 89 and 91 happened and we had a ( brief ) time of tremendous cultural optimism and hope . 
  that era of course also ended and the cycle continues . 
  i 'm fairly confident there 'll be bad times ahead , as will there be good ones . 
  violence might escalate , it might stay where it is for a while but it will abate at some point and it 'll escalate again some time after that . 
  i really do n't get why there 's even croat-serb tension and saber-rattling . 
  the general antipathy i get , but at this point what do they really have to fight over ? 
  [ i mean they technically have a border dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia%e2%80%93serbia_border_dispute ) [ but it hardly looks like something worth all this fuss . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/croatia_serbia_border_backa_baranja.svg ), 
  i 'm sure stonewalling kosovo internationally is a boon for vucic domestically and is somewhat emotionally satisfying and everything on a national level but i fail to see how it really helps serbia . 
  russia and serbia could stonewall and pester kosovo in the un till the end of time but russia does not , nor will it ever have the power to again subjugate kosovo to serbia . 
  wanted to emphasize the commonality of both of them being from minority groups , though yeah you 've got a point . 
  mind you there 's a precedent to this whole aboutaleb situation . 
  in 2010 job cohen , the then popular ( jewish ) mayor of amsterdam , resigned from his position and was elected head of the pvda ( labour ) . 
  the party probably got a better result at the polls as they might otherwise have gotten with 30 seats ( still a loss of three seats as compared to the previous election ) . 
  talks about a coalition with the vvd ( nominally right-wing liberals but roughly analogous to uk conservatives as far as policy goes ) who 'd won the most seats then broke down , causing a right-wing conservative coalition government ( vvd + christian democrats ) supported by the pvv ( wilders ' party ) . 
  cohen stuck around in the opposition for some time but was largely seen as ineffectual , leading to his resignation in 2012 . 
  being a popular mayor does n't make you a guaranteed success in national politics . 
  what / u/h0agh said is accurate . 
  the ` against ' camp was very specifically aiming for an anti-eu protest vote , and the ` for ' camp was awkwardly split between actually voting and deliberately not voting to keep it beneath 30 % ( which is what i did for instance ) . 
  it 's not really specifically against helping ukraine in general ( though ` solidarity ' with eastern europe and this pseudo-utopian eu ideology is fairly unpopular in general over here ) , people just really do n't want it in the eu in light of the ( perceived massive ) issues with earlier eastern european expansion . 
  mh17 also is n't * that * big a deal . 
  most people would probably rightly blame russia for it but that grievance does n't exactly translate into some messianic desire to save ukraine . 
  [ okay ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5b99f0/europe_according_to_the_danes/d9n97jn/?context=3 ) [ there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5b99f0/europe_according_to_the_danes/d9n9dqw/?context=3 ) [ fam ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4mmtia/what_are_your_opinions_on_a_united_states_of/d3wzbft/?context=10000 ), 
  cyprus got in by greece threatening to veto any and all other accessions if they did n't . 
  not to mention nobody ( apart from turkey ) ever recognized the trnc and the idea was always for it to be reintegrated into a new cypriot state . 
  serbia does n't have a sponsor in the same sense that cyprus had with greece and the vast majority of eu countries have recognized kosovo 's independence . 
  of course not all of them do . 
  the point is that 23 of them do , and ( because approval of new members has to be unanimous ) every single one of those has veto power over serbia 's accession . 
  it 's not a requirement officially but given that any individual eu member can block accession it 's extremely unlikely serbia will get in without recognizing kosovo . 
   '' ... but saying things like ` these lands will be ours and only we will rule it ' wo n't work.they think they have the upperhand . '', 
  [ hmmm ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/04/05/how-the-crisis-over-nagorno-karabakh-could-get-worse-fast/ )  `` the fire of armenia 's massacres in karabakh continues to burn in our hearts , '' erdogan said on monday , referring to the death of 12 azerbaijani soldiers . 
  `` karabakh will surely be returned to its rightful owner , azerbaijan , one day . '', 
  [ hmmmm ] ( http://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/karabakh/2688789.html )  the turkish president also noted that the occupied territories of azerbaijan must be returned to their rightful owners . 
   azerbaijanis are the rightful owners of these lands and they must return to their lands , said erdogan, 
  quality contribution , dude . 
   carry on the circlejerk . 
  lol ? 
  not to mention the fact that the erdogan administration has once again willingly escalated the conflict with the kurds to a level about equal to the kosovan conflict , for which serbia was bombed to hell . 
  turkey would 've had a tough time getting in just with lingering anti-muslim , anti-turkish sentiment ( and the fact that a new accession would need every single country 's approval which for one thing means that regardless of practical , moral , ethical , and legal grounds the roc would prevent the accession anyway as long as the cyprus situation is unresolved ) but there 's a host of issues turkey has , any one of which would 've been a good reason to just put a halt to the process anyway . 
  * if romania had a conflict with its hungarians the same way turkey does with its kurds it would n't have been allowed to join . 
  * if bulgaria locked up journalists to the level that turkey does it would never have been allowed to join . 
  * if croatia still ran an ethnically cleansed client state in bih the way turkey does in cyprus it would 've never been allowed to join . 
  any one of these issues is a good argument for not proceeding along the accession process , and turkey has all three of them and [ a host more problems on negotiations about the * acquis communautaire * alone . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) obviously cyprus and the kurdish conflict are n't wholly the fault of turkey itself and solving them is n't merely contingent on turkey flipping a switch , as it were ( for instance recognizing the roc prior to resolving the conflict is probably political suicide for whomever proposes it , even an established strongman like erdogan , and thoroughly resolving sectarian insurgencies like the kurdish situation is politically difficult for any society ) . 
  but regardless of the share of the blame for them , they are turkey 's issues , and are a convincing argument against turkey 's accession process as long as they are unresolved . 
  modern-day moldova was first taken by russia from the then principality of moldavia ( one of the two principalities that would later form romania ) in 1812 during its war with ottoman turkey . 
  when after wwi ( during the russian civil war ) romania took the region the soviet union needed a pretext besides irredentism or strategic concerns to regain its former frontier with romania , so it created the [ moldovan assr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldavian_autonomous_soviet_socialist_republic ) which was compromised of modern day transnistria and parts of modern-day south-western ukraine . 
  when the romanians bowed to the soviet ultimatum of 1940 and ceded the demanded territories to the soviet union parts of those territories were combined with parts of the moldovan assr to form the moldovan ssr . 
  important thing to note here is that the soviets promoted a sense separate ( from romanian ) moldovan identity , complete with cyrillic alphabet for their ( essentially romanian ) language ( which had a prior history of cyrillic further back in the past ) . 
  making kumbaya happen is a long process , and one can certainly doubt whether immediate citizenship would have done it better than what latvia and estonia have actually gone through . 
  quite arguably it is happening . 
  [ latvian non-citizens are down to less than 12 % of latvia 's population . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-citizens_\\ ( latvia \\ ) #demography ) [ estonian non-citizens are down to 6.8 % of estonia 's population . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_estonia#citizenship ), 
   what risk of being ungovernable ? 
  30-40 % of the population being alienated from the mainstream and living in a parallel society , who can be easily influenced by a ( potentially ) aggressive neighboring state . 
  who are liable to vote explicitly for their ethnic interests and the geopolitical interests of that neighbor . 
  it 's an immense danger . 
   be warned - do n't treat people of a nation as big and powerful as the russian one as human trash . 
  you may strongly regret it eventually when peaceful coexistence wo n't be possible . 
  and i am not trying to intimidate anyone , i am against bigotry from either side , but if i were in your position , i would be a little bit more careful . 
  i 'm not from the region . 
  i 've been critical myself of baltic attitudes towards their russophone populations . 
  i 'm just saying , it 's not as easy as giving them all citizenship , sitting in a circle and singing ` kumbaya ' resulting in a pluralistic wonderland .
