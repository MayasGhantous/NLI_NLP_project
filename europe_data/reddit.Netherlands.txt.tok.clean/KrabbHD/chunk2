  this weather was extreme even for autumn . 
  flybe , i reckon . 
  yep , just 50.0001 percent !, 
  not all that much !!!, 
  better eye bleach : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrujeyh33ui, 
  standing in the middle of a bike lane ? 
  you can have it if you also take limburg . 
  i do n't think we do . 
  can we join ? 
   one implication of that is that customers all over europe should receive the same service if they order the same service . 
  what does this mean for services like netflix ? 
  putain - putin . 
  i think not . 
  i hope / u/vylander offers an adequate dutch replacement . 
  my point is that you are constantly contradicting yourself . 
   `` hitler never intended a major war and at most was prepared for only a limited war against poland . '', 
  the origins of the second world war , a j p taylor  that . 
   again not england . 
   you said only poland . 
   i 'm not saying the uk and france started ww2 . 
  i 'm saying the uk and france started a war with germany , not the other way around . 
  yes you are ... you said :  many people just forget that the allies started ww2 . 
  and yet in a little book called * mein kampf * written by a guy called a. hitler , it is written that he intends to take large amounts of * lebensraum * - living space - from russia . 
  saying that the allies started world war ii is just not justified . 
  http://i.imgur.com/mye2qjv.png if sevastopol was their only access to the black sea , what is this entire area to the right ? 
  pumping england and the european resistance full of american weapons worked wonders back in the day . 
  because hitler invaded fucking poland ? 
  let 's not forget that hitler was n't a good guy who steamrolled his neighbors who declared war on him , he also took belgium , the netherlands , norway , and your own country denmark . 
  how can you forget this ? 
  if germany were to be the only one to respond , it 's gon na be a field day for russian propaganda . 
  i believe brown bread is the standard in the netherlands . 
  it is in my social circle . 
  i do n't know about wimlex but beatrix of the netherlands always addressed the dutch people as `` landgenoten , '', 
  well then it shows that i 'm not a geography buff :p, 
  i think so . 
  may be wrong though . 
  not the first war in the 20th century started by an assassination in the balkans either . 
  typographical error , most likely . 
  and the brits their pussies . 
  get your facts straight : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voting_in_switzerland#voting_qualifications  switzerland currently has about 7.5 million inhabitants ; 5.6 million are swiss citizens who have the right to vote although some cantons ( states ) and municipalities have granted foreigners the right to vote if they have lived a certain number of years in switzerland . 
  the registered voters in the 2013 german elections were 61,946,900 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_2013, 
  8 million swiss and 82 million germans . 
  move over kid , the big cyclists are talking . 
  do n't go to any city with classicist sculptures then ... 
  some more art ( roman art this time ) : http://content.bandzoogle.com/users/mzacharyjohnson/images/content/roman-man-at-met-300.jpg http://img.weiku.com/waterpicture/000/874/art_roman_stone_sculptures_thinking_man_with_mirotic_397_3.jpg http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/belvedere_apollo_pio-clementino_inv1015.jpg http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/marcellus_louvre_ma1207.jpg https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/bd/35/5e/bd355ee3aae1fbddad70d6fc65fbd1fc.jpg, 
  because it 's the vitruvian man , which is a drawing that does n't feature jeans . 
  why would you feature a part of history on your coin if you 're going to change it to appease prude americans ? 
  this drawing is also featured in many math classes too if you 're wondering . 
  nudity is n't a big deal over here , not as big as the european heritage . 
  i saw what you wrote before your edit , and yes times have changed in the last 2000 years . 
  this change is better attributed to the last 1/2 century though . 
  we are n't a country of prudes . 
  meanwhile on public dutch tv , nude people are shown at prime hours . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.flabber.nl/weblog/video/new-kids-on-the-block-s03e12-swat-team-3690 ) clip ( not safe for americans ) was shown on nederland 3 a few years back iirc . 
  this is true , l'hexagone : http://i.imgur.com/vk7n31r.png, 
  shhhh , i 'm trying to make fun of the belgians over here !, 
  that 's the stupid bureaucratic legislation i have come to expect from belgium . 
  / r/menkampf is a subreddit that takes quotes from people like this and replaces white men with jews . 
  suddenly , they sound like nazis . 
  i 'd recommend everyone to take a look there and laugh at these idiots . 
  gorbachev though ? 
  the bombardments on omaha beach were largely unsuccesful too . 
  even less populated than / r/zwolle . 
  cut myself on that edge . 
  hey hey :d, 
  accu , cement , citroen ? 
  yeah , they are . 
  i have never said america is a threat to peace . 
  neither have most . 
  we usually call h2o in its solid state ice . 
  yep and you 're ours . 
  \\ #freeswagdracula 2015, 
  on the one hand , you have a point . 
  on the other , you use a samsung phone . 
  this is a tough one . 
  this is mostly dutch post . 
  foreign post will take longer . 
  i 'm afraid ( or happy ) that most of the post will arrive the following days . 
  dutchie here , i think this translation is the best of the 3 . 
  i mentioned this before but styling wise ` groetjes ` sounds friendlier than ` groeten ` . 
  postnl is gon na have to hire additional staff tomorrow . 
  groetjes sounds friendlier , by the way . 
  just some dutch writing style . 
  remember to pronounce the k. 
  kentucky * / u/n00bvin , kenucky is a typo by visvis here , not a dutch translation of the state . 
  just to be clear , 
  [ you were wrong , comrade . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2l4344n_48 ), 
  at least we beat finland . 
  also the reddit thread i linked above, 
  ehh that depends on how you define dead . 
  i call that dead . 
  i agree with you . 
  that said , i do like the idea of the most powerful military force in the history of man kind backing us . 
  do you , as a czech , sometimes wish that operation unthinkable would have happened ? 
  honestly , i think nato would stand a very good chance . 
  america has hands-down the strongest military in the world . 
  i think your bundeskanzlerin disagrees , and did you know germany is part of nato ? 
  you may be drafted and forced to fight in the baltics or on your own soil . 
   top gear bad example , top gear is kill,
