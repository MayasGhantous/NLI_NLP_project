  uh yeah ? 
  that 's because the largest ** airforce ** in the world is the us air force , the second largest is the us navy , and the fouth largest is the us army . 
  they do n't * need * much artillery . 
  i like the abrams and the [ leo ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/leopard_2_a5_der_bundeswehr.jpg ) but nothing beats [ this fine piece of british engineering ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/challenger_2_main_battle_tank_patrolling_outside_basra,_iraq_mod_45148325.jpg ) . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30gz5l/willingness_to_defend_poland_among_men_aged_1860/cpsgg72 i was wrong :p, 
  belgium ( flanders ) , the uk ( scotland or england ) , sweden ( greater stockholm area ) , or denmark ( copenhagen is nice and bikey ) . 
  oh it 's the guy that types in 2 languages again . 
  well , it 's 3 in the netherlands . 
  i wonder what would have happened if the nazi high command overthrew hitler and made a deal with the western allies to beat russia instead , with europe being restored to previous borders . 
  when i refer to `` russians '' i mean their leaders , not the people . 
  i completely get that . 
  i sometimes imagine alternative history timelines , and the most common one is one where germany beats the ussr but not the western allies ( somehow ) and the entirety of europe gets the western treatment . 
  oh my god , i was really confused by these comments because i kept reading preparations rather than reparations . 
  you could argue that everything that is n't forgotten exists so yes , it will exist for a thousand years , in a way . 
  what 's your opinion of the g36 standard issue assault rifle ? 
  asking after reading this : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30havn/german_soldiers_dont_trust_their_battle_rifle_g36/, 
  russia 's parliament is not going to do jack . 
  latvia is a nato country . 
  you should get that cough checked . 
  i just did some research and actually the bundeswehr is in better shape currently . 
  however , that may change . 
  ` murica and the uk , for scale : [ us navy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_navy ) * 325,143 active duty personnel * 107,355 reserve personnel * 275 ships * 3,700 + aircraft * 10 aircraft carriers * 10 amphibious assault ships * 10 amphibious transport docks * 12 dock landing ships * 22 cruisers * 62 destroyers * 5 frigates * 4 littoral combat ships * 71 submarines [ royal navy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_navy ) * 6 destroyers * 13 frigates * 11 submarines * 1 amphibious assault ship * 2 amphibious transport docks * 15 mine countermeasures ships * 22 patrol ships * 4 survey ships * 2 icebreakers, 
  all joking aside , poland has a better military than germany . 
   population populated *, 
  saint martin, 
  remember how effective the multilingual and multicultiral army of austria-hungary was ? 
  well that is my biggest fear with a pan-european army . 
  fuck french too . 
  scratch french too . 
  i was calling with the paypal customer support and i go this flemish woman . 
  did n't understand a word . 
  next time i call i 'm like `` yeah your colleague , whom i spoke to earlier , mentioned something about deactivating x and y. 
  however , i did n't quite get it because it was in a thick flemish accent which was hard to decipher , could you elaborate on that ? '', 
  `` oh yeah i can see who handled your earlier call and i know what you mean . 
   australia you mean new holland . 
  so it 's like our ban on piracy, 
  well , i do use engeland in dutch, 
  britain is what i always use . 
  united states of mexico -  mexico, 
  the former yugoslav republic of macedonia ? 
  edit : nope , that 's shorter, 
  as a dutchman who also does n't live in nh or sh , i do n't give a shit because holland ( 2 syllables ) is more practical than the netherlands ( 4 syllables and a th sound no dutch person has ever pronounced correctly in the history of our country ) . 
  what 's the point of having flags in it ? 
  we know what country we 're in . 
   belgish brilliant . 
  i wonder how / r/the _ donald would react if they found out the dutch parliament has zero state-related symbols . 
  no coat of arms , no flags , etc. 
  tu/e has a good reputation for civil engineering . 
  also , obligatory `` fuck leiden '' comment , because it 's really fucking elitist . 
  blame the aggressor , not the person defending his home . 
  not even for 1 % . 
  i have some hypotheses : 1 . 
  fake identity information 2 . 
  russian regulars are better trained than rebels so they do n't get captured as quickly . 
  where you live is n't everything either . 
  adele has a cockney accent and even in a mansion , she would n't be consider upper class because of this , her ancestry and her past . 
  money is neigh irrelevant i agree , which is what i tried to say . 
  oh look the edgy `` it 's state owned so it 's evuhl '' circlejerk has arrived . 
  how 's middle school ? 
  not really , since the names fyro macedonia and simply macedonian are so simply exchanged that it could be an error . 
  malvinas would pretty much guarantee that the person speaking did so intentionally . 
  note that this is a motion that was voted on yesterday after being published last week tuesday by pvda mp servaes . 
  it 's up to koenders , our minister of foreign affairs , to execute the motion or not . 
  this is ** by no means binding ** . 
   but it 's interesting how geert wilders & co is opposed to banning weapon sales to a fundamentalist muslim state . 
  nah , it was answering a call from the eu . 
  wilders.lua is pretty simple : if motie.getorigin ( ) = = `` eu '' then fractie.vote ( `` against '' ) stop, 
  not in britain . 
  class is what defines class in britain . 
  adele is making millions but she 's not upper class . 
  that really depends on where you got it . 
  he is very appealing to the uneducated people who want to blame the muslims for everything . 
  that 's a good thing !, 
  i could go without seeing his bleached wig . 
  trump is the american wilders . 
  buma is one of the few with principles . 
  if most people support the parties in a coalition , the majority is represented . 
  yeah , it is a simplistic attitude . 
  how to stop it in its tracks ? 
   he did not say he was going to remove them . 
  `` minder minder minder '' `` dan gaan we dat regelen ! '', 
  that 's what happened in r/rmtk, 
  bulletproof vests do n't stop headshots . 
  pvv vs pvv . 
  fight !, 
  good point , let 's not devolve into america, 
   if somewhere is a high crime zone k\u00f6ln is n't a high risk zone, 
  maybe self-defence courses ? 
  thirst knows no bounds, 
  also plenty of americans who have to fear for their kids ' safety when they go to school because conservative nutjobs in congress want to keep their guns . 
  need i remind you that all recent mass school shootings were perpetrated by white americans ? 
  that 's why i 'm sad we 're not included . 
  we 'd probably be in the top 3 of unfavourable opinions . 
  mainly down to mh17 and their treatment of gays . 
  at least we see the potholes before we hit them now ... 
  or above the roads and still have awesome zoab, 
  the one from hattem to zwolle has a physical median, 
  we actually do though , i go across one every day . 
  even has a physical median . 
  zwolle is correct .
