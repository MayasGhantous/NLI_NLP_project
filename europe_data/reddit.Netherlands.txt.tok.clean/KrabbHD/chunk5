  50 plus will get like 6 seats i 'm afraid, 
  have you never met someone who just did n't feel like starting an argument ? 
   failing unwilling to *, 
  ah you 're one of those people then . 
  not going into it . 
   vdd also had its losses , but there are n't much options to its base and many people are voting for them just to avoid pvv in first ( which at this point is purely symbolic ) . 
  plus vvd voters tend to be quite a lot more optimistic and accepting of compromises . 
   there have n't been any extremes in power . 
  except you know , donald trump right now , who appoints the entire executive branch . 
  a congress more than willing to cooperate , which is the legislative branch . 
  the only thing that tends to be slightly stable is the judicial branch and even that would be more stable were it apolitical . 
  the main point here is that in a proportional system , the power generally shifts between moderate options that are rather close to each other . 
  in fptp systems , the power shifts between extremes . 
  that is the epitome of instability . 
   but the vehicle of their ideas ( the party ) stays strong and in that way they ensure political stability . 
  lmao . 
  republicans of 2 years ago are n't the republicans of today . 
   to be honest i find the us system more stable and consistent . 
  few years democrats rule all election few years republicans rule all election few years democrats rule all what 's stable/consistent about that ? 
  parliament is going to smell an awful lot like olive oil if that happens . 
  anyhow , i do n't think any of those people are getting in . 
  sgp vnl fvd probably . 
  they will have 3 or 4 seats combined . 
  and the sgp will have all of those . 
   for an mp not necessarily a mp , just a candidate though . 
  i hope fvd and vnl get fewer than the 60k votes to get elected into parliament . 
   really ca n't see vvd going to coalition with gl . 
  nah vvd will coalition with anyone . 
  it 's their greatest strength , their awesome ability to compromise . 
  they 've even worked together with gl to make a budget for 2013 . 
  i do n't know !, 
  visit racist places on the internet ( such as the facebook page `` nederland mijn vaderland '' and t_d ) and you 'll see them . 
  uh yeah , otherwise people would n't be calling for a #muslimban, 
  for all we know , it 's a good looking ass . 
  true tbh, 
  and 2017 ... ? 
   but it 's one of the lowest . 
  got chills of shame down my spine reading that 75 % of dutch jews were killed , and there were countries with even higher percentages !, 
  what . 
  the . 
  i get what you meant , i 'm only reinforcing it, 
   for germany the official count of the june '33 census is 499.682 yeah and you can bet your ass the nazis were good at counting jews, 
  i mean they 're blaming 1.6 bn people for acts of terrorism some ( maybe a few thousand ) of the people in that group commit . 
  except it did n't ... 
  great strawman dude !, 
  that 's totally what i said . 
  one week later , too . 
  you really ca n't let this go , can you ? 
  let 's not fool ourselves here . 
  the world has never been less violent than it is today . 
  what regime would you rather be subject to ? 
  german occupation or vichy ? 
  far left hates everything that 's not far left . 
  they hate the left even more than the right because traitors . 
  they 're too stupid to see that that only hurts the left , including the far left . 
  shame . 
  uh what ? 
  / s right, 
  he was talking about belgium . 
  such a male thing to say , that opportunities are already equal . 
  you just ca n't let go of the fact that women are just as good as men governing functions , can you ? 
  it requires a very different skill set than a military job , a skill set that 's present in both sexes . 
  i do n't know how you think a minister 's post is in any way comparable to a job in the army . 
  you 're not listening though , 50/50 is how you get the best . 
  because you 're dismissing that a fifty-fifty split would have equally qualified people on both sides on grounds that `` some people are better than other people . '', 
  in order to make that true , that would have to mean that one gender is better at governing than another gender , otherwise the variations would equal out due to the law of large numbers . 
  you 're saying that the ability to govern is more likely to be in one or the other gender with your first sentence and then you contradict yourself in the second . 
  i 'd argue there is . 
  why would women ( or men ) be less qualified ? 
  except it 's not the case that there is a vastly disproportionate number of qualified men or women . 
  there 's no evidence to suggest that is the case . 
  also cia world factbook : total population : 0.98 male ( s ) / female ( 2016 est. ), 
  for both nl and ca, 
  50,3 % female in both holland and canada, 
  the world is 50 % man and 50 % woman ... 
  that 's the point . 
  women and men , while they could offer a different perspective on matters , are equally qualified . 
  if 50 % of cabinet members are female , it simply gives them an equal opportunity . 
  and the best people are n't women ? 
  so we wait until it 's fully approved ? 
  wrong flair, 
  so you base your opinion on hearsay ? 
  you do n't have to like trudeau to like canada . 
  trudeau is still great though, 
  * `` i base whom i make deals with on their personality '' *, 
   the german constitutional court will rule parts of ceta unconstitutional why, 
  i remember this from taxi !, 
  stop copying us polan, 
  do i have a usernote ? 
  so you 're telling me [ these guys ] ( https://i.imgur.com/d5fn849.png ) are restricting circlejerks ? 
   given the context of the comments round it is how i put it as error rather then malice . 
  errors can still breed fake news . 
  yes but only at night or in really quiet periods, 
  well yes , but cost is n't the critical factor in this project . 
  also should be noted that all of those bridges are bascule bridges and you should n't build a bascule bridge for a highway . 
  [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/infrastructureporn/comments/5stxvp/another_angle_of_the_new_a1_aquaduct_vechtzicht/ddi0x8t/ ) explains some of it :  according to this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amyn8nnoihc ) ( in dutch ) it 's   - cleaner air  - noise reduction  - looks better  - improved flow ( for ships/traffic )   edit : [ actual link \\ ( it has some nice animations to see the process \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amyn8nnoihc ), 
  yes . 
  and we 're going to link the last bit up with a bridge , and martin schulz will make the british pay for it, 
  agreed . 
  i hear the argument `` you would n't like it if you had a windmill in your backyard '' a lot and every time i say `` i do like it .
