  funny that they said holland . 
  if they only saw the weather here . 
  can i ask for asylum in portugal instead ? 
  i would like to write some descriptions since the pictures by themselves are unfair for the monuments , and most of them hide an important historical meaning . 
  * both # 1 ( the factory ) and # 4 ( the house ) are important because they were pioneers in modern architecture . 
  they might seem a little `` meh '' right now but they were built in the 30s and 20s respectively . 
  retrospectively that kind of design is quite amazing and made a change in the future . 
  * # 2 is amsterdam . 
  ` nuff said . 
  * # 3 might seem like a lot of mud but it has an unique biodiversity due to not being a common ecosystem . 
  it also has a very cute [ hospital for sick seals ] ( http://www.noorderkrant.nl/files/2014/02/zeehondencreche_pieterburen-11.jpg ) . 
  looks like just a bike road but actually it is a whole town . 
  built in the 17th century it is the first polder reclaimed from a lake . 
  using only windmills they drained the lake and built a town !, 
  * # 6 ( pump station ) is the largest one of its kind in the world . 
  built in the 20s , it nicely represents the long story of the country against the water . 
  * # 7 ( kinderdijk ) is a range of 19 windmills built to drain the water and reclaim the land . 
  built in the 18th century , they are well preserved and the largest group of its kind . 
  * # 8 ( fortified line ) is a 135 km long fortification line with 42 forts and a [ huge part of land ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/stelling_van_amsterdam_the_netherlands.svg ) that could be flooded and drained at will for defense . 
  it was designed to be 30 cm deep so boats could n't be able to cross it . 
  * # 9 ( shockland ) used to be an island with high risk of flooding until the land was reclaimed from the sea . 
  like # 5 and # 9 , it 's dutch vs water . 
  * # 10 ( willemstad ) is the city center of cura\u00e7ao . 
  beautifully preserved , it is a nice cultural syncretism between the dutch and the caribbean , showed by its architecture . 
  can relate . 
  i used to live in a student house with around 60 people from all over the world . 
  the only guy who i ** really ** could n't understand was a british guy with a very thick accent . 
  and he has a hugeass picture next to the hotdog place of my town 's ikea, 
  it 's so sad that many countries are slowly changing the subsidized education into an american-like debt system . 
  they did here in the netherlands and everybody i know has a slowly crippling debt .

  a looooooooot !, 
  indonesian food and spices are big part of the cuisine here . 
  and then to a lesser extent it was also influenced by surinam and the caribbean, 
  why are poor countries ~ ~ stupid ~ ~ conservative ?

  then it 's just the accent . 
  the c/z/s and j are pronounced very differently and , in my perception , spanish from spain is more guttural . 
  also the tone changes a lot .

  i agree , everything is extremely similar . 
  the only difference is we do n't have those kind of blinds in mexico . 
  `` almost spanish but not quite '' ?

  sometimes i wish there was a little more of `` metropolis '' here and there . 
  bellas playas , bellas mujeres , bellos tacos mexicanos, 
  while benito ju\u00e1rez is not my favorite president , it could be a nice choice considering the other national heroes ( hidalgo , morelos , etc. ), 
  were not leader of the nations at all . 
  other choice would be the controversial yet important porfirio d\u00edaz who modernized the whole country . 
  how much of an `` improvement '' is inhumane conditions in poland in comparison to your regular being in north korea ?

  [ relevant video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkgn2g9d0dc ) of how noisy ( or not ) are wind farms .
