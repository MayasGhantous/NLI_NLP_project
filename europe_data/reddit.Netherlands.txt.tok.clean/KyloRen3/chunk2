  and we do n't have sun , so maybe solar panels would n't have been the most efficient choice . 
  there is a tv fee in ireland ? 
  so we inspired every other flag ? 
  i actually find it incredible that you can find very easily australian and south african wines but not european ones like romanian or greek . 
  i think it 's a pity . 
  what do the colors mean ? 
  as a side note , i like german wine a lot but i 'm always criticized for it :'(, 
  til romania makes wine . 
  ( do n't kill me . 
  i 've just never seen one in the supermarket ), 
  for me ... and i 'm feeling goooood . 
  i can go 6 months without sex . 
  but 6 months without fapping , hell no . 
  i 'd definitely miss cheap easyjet . 
  wow , did the arrive all the way there due to trading ? 
  indians surely liked byzantine artifacts . 
  i also know a lot of people north of my home country who insist that we are ruining theirs , and that we should pay for a wall . 
  unfortunately bigotry can be found everywhere . 
  as mentioned above , this is not about multiculturalism but extremism instead . 
  there is a lot of multiculturalism inside latin america ( where i come from ) and it is very enriching . 
  also , the latin americans that come here to europe are well integrated into the local culture and at the same time contribute to it . 
  there is sun in the picture -10 / 10, 
  i 'll blame the delicious , amazing churros . 
  if they ask me during winter i 'll say my life is shit . 
  but if they ask me on the only sunny day of the year then i 'll be the happiest person . 
  weather has such a big effect on me . 
  and the weather in netherlands is not really the best . 
  honest questions . 
  what does joining the church mean ? 
  how does it work ? 
  why can not you leave ? 
  is it like a government register ? 
  sorry , but i 'm very curious on how these kind of things work . 
  i 'm from mexico and the church was separated from the state in the 19th century and now anything about the church having power is a huuuuuge taboo , so we do n't have these kind of things . 
  tax haven fight !, 
  depends of who you are . 
  if you 're a student or if your earnings are low then high budget cuts will happen to programs relevant to you . 
  it has been mentioned above that it 's mostly because religious reasons and because schools ( common voting places ) close early on wednesday 's . 
  i think it 's better because you 're already out for work . 
  if it was on a sunday i know a lot of people who would n't vote because laziness , especially if it 's a rainy day ( typical dutch weather ) . 
  there 's a lot of voting polls . 
  in fact , there 's 2 in my workplace ( a hospital ) so you only would have to walk 5 min and that 's it . 
  mountains here are something you see only in cartoons . 
  come to me free trade avocados . 
  beating finland , one stat at a time . 
  i like reading happy news for greece . 
  a small gift from the new world to the spaniards that conquered them . 
  mexican here , can confirm this fact . 
  she was amazing . 
  her face is pure [ gold ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/03/10/woman-reaction.jpg ) also , the translation was friendlier . 
  literally she says something along `` i bet it hurts you to see a woman like me is standing here '' while it was merely translated to `` upsets you '' . 
  til australia hates the whole world . 
  still fried apples :p, 
  not sure if holy roman empire 2.0 or eu4 map . 
  the dutch ? 
  nice food ? 
  i think you had indonesian food . 
  i 've always found it interesting , since pomme is apple . 
  leaving out the `` de terre '' changes the meaning drastically . 
  furansu-chan noticed me ( \u25d5 \u203f \u25d5 ), 
  there are bad t\u00edos stealing their jobs , their women and their beaches . 
  i know it 's a joke but [ in m\u00e9xico the unemployment is 3.6 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/mexico/unemployment-rate ) :'(, 
  yet , vvd in the tweede kamer just voted against more marijuana growth regulations a few weeks ago . 
  total culinary disaster . 
  let him show his substance ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  caused by gas extraction , not tectonic movement . 
  what benefits are non-dutch people allowed to have other than rent subsidy ( huurtoeslag ) ? 
  [ serious question ], 
  just walk through the touristic areas, 
  [ # 1 smokers in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita ), 
  when your civilization spawns with oil tiles ( +5 production , +1 gold ) next to you , it 's kind of cheating . 
  i 'd rather have liege meatballs than mussels though . 
  he really wants to become fortuyn . 
  turkey is from mexico , where we call it * guajolote * . 
  this word derives from the n\u00e1huatl ( the aztec language ) word * huex\u00f3lotl * , which means ** big monster ** . 
  +1 production , +2 gold , enough for a surplus apparently, 
  sharia law . 
  trump was right . 
  til , interesting !, 
  and meanwhile the vvd is planning on cutting ( even more ) housing subsidy , unemployment benefits and health insurance . 
  yay . 
  austerity . 
   comment about denmark being ruled by sharia law . 
  canada , us , china , us , uk . 
  let 's be honest . 
  all of these people have significantly more money than hungary . 
  look at what brazil did even having a decent , rising economy . 
   \u03c6 = thermodynamic fugacity coefficient ftfy, 
  go netherlands !, 
  amsterdam being ... [ free ] ( http://68.media.tumblr.com/c81b92994d071826b59dd7861770c19d/tumblr_nwc049oktu1uhhmkqo1_500.jpg ) ( nsfw ), 
  wow , [ amsterdam ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wwfjf42.png ) is a tiny tiny tiny place compared to all the other cities . 
  if norway has the privilege to be included in the poll . 
  i thought i was dumb for not knowing what a grammatical ~ ~ gender ~ ~ case is , but it turns out the languages i speak do not use it . 
  i just came to make sure we 're above finland this time . 
  was not disappointed . 
  do n't let the dutch compete in this new trend . 
  i 'm $ 100/month and $ 385 from my pocket a year away from europe . 
  even in mexico it was extremely popular . 
  any person can sing you the intro , `` abuelito dime t\u00fa ... '', 
  and that 's exactly why i left mexico for the netherlands .
