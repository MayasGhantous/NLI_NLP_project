  needs more jpeg, 
  total disaster . 
  sad . 
  slovakia , croatia , romania , bulgaria and cyprus . 
  let the hunger games begin . 
  belgium deserves more love :'(, 
  mexican here . 
  mexico is a huge country , as big as going from dublin to istanbul . 
  yes , there is a lot of drug-related deaths but they are mostly very deep in the countryside and your typical juan will never come close to them . 
  on the other hand , the weather , the food , the culture and the warm friendly people make life wonderful . 
  i do n't know if this is bad news or good news because these little bastards eat my garden . 
  and more importantly , crops . 
  no one is ever allowed to enter or leave the dutch kingdom . 
  and sweden . 
  apparently . 
  suck it finland !!, 
  ^ guy ^ or ^ girl . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ believe ^ ^ in ^ ^ equal ^ ^ rights . 
  the whole country is heavily regulated by dykes . 
  i would assume it 's the same with this river . 
  i wish i could understand what 's going on there , seems like a fun place . 
  romania having all that delicious fast internet and many romanians not using it breaks my heart . 
  the same for dutch food . 
  completely bland and boring unless you count the indonesian food . 
  but i think that 's also because the calvinist/protestant past of this country . 
  even belgium beat us :'( serious question , though , what happened here ? 
  it 's very confusing because in mexico we do n't even harvest the yellow one . 
  the first time i saw one was when i was 19 . 
  another good day where finland is beaten by the low countries . 
  so much happiness and culture, 
  we already [ got one ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/maximilian_i_of_mexico ), 
  includes typical dutch weather . 
  separated at birth . 
  weird , because the only place in my town with unlimited soda refill is the ikea . 
  for me it 's just ryan air, 
  that explains why it takes 1 week to make an appointment with the doctor in the netherlands ( at least outside the randstad ) . 
  also if your country does not allow you to renounce to your nationality e.g. 
  til ireland had lazy eye as a beauty standard back then . 
  not too fast , look at the second graph honey, 
  kazakhstan number one exporter of potassium . 
  other countries have inferior potassium . 
  china is so big that citing among themselves is probably enough to make them appear here . 
  damn you finland and your slightly better rankings of everything, 
  damn you finland ^ * shakes ^ fist *, 
  actually [ this is the shameful song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsi0fdvzxu ) or in case [ it 's not available in your country ] ( http://www.ebaumsworld.com/videos/weird-dutch-scooter-song/81659347/ ), 
  that awkward moment when you barely understand anything and realize your english is not as good as you thought . 
  / r/thenetherlands remains neutral yet is unexpectedly attacked by / r/de . 
  the dutch rebuild rotterdam-3 and start developing tulip-01 , their last hope . 
  sounds like something i 've heard before ...  [ they 're bringing drugs , they 're bringing crime , they 're rapists and some i assume are good people . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqn3v8ejvpg ), 
  error 404 : netherlands and flanders not found . 
  wow . 
  i 've never seen this in my life and looks scary as hell . 
  the best comment in the whole thread and it 's hidden, 
  yes . 
  we beat finland . 
  damn . 
  i hate you denmark . 
  not long ago i read the brochure of a heating company here . 
  they advertised themselves as using green , sustainable and renewable energy . 
  resulted that they burned wood pellets . 
  while it 's probably better than burning coal or gas , the netherlands is not known for its * vast * forests . 
  countries really need a tighter control of the veracity of the asylum applications \\* ** looking at you germany ***, 
  i think one good way to avoid counterfeiting would be to accept card payments in every transaction \\* ** looking at you , germany ***, 
  israel is still not recognized as a country by many arab countries , cuba and north korea, 
  so beautiful . 
  and i 'm here just looking at the frozen grazing farms through the window . 
  that environment though . 
  damn . 
  til, 
  i 've always wondered why , since the lion is not a very european animal, 
  i cry when i see all my workmates with their uglyass tasteless sandwich with one slice of cheese . 
  no love . 
  no nothing . 
  not even grilled in the sandwich maker :'( then they pick on my because i eat chicken with lentils . 
  then it 's only in groningen . 
  interesting . 
  you can recycle voluntarily glass and paper but everything else goes into the same place . 
  it has [ been well known and documented that a percentage of americans are unable to use maps ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj3inxz8dww ) . 
  the sad thing is that the overview does n't have the us to compare , rendering the map useless to them . ^ / s, 
  i find impressive to see the netherlands so high considering that our trash is not pre-separated like in germany . 
  edit : depends on the municipality, 
  in mexico we have eternal spring , so it was amazing for me to see the flowers/sun/falling leaves/snow cycle just like in the cartoons !, 
  christmas markets are so beautiful . 
  yet , i see the absurdly high prices on everything and as the student i am , i just walk away . 
  as you can see in figure 1 , we conclude that netherlands   finland . 
  also for me , i get to know what happened in the country since i 'm always out of the loop . 
  the curonian spit near klaipeda must be one of the most beautiful beaches i 've ever seen . 
  why the hell did they open the door ? 
  just go to / r/personalfinance . 
  something something unexpected surgery , healthcare , university loan , 401k, 
  i know , and i 'm fully aware of it . 
  i buy it because it is the most similar thing to some cheeses we use in my native mexico for tacos and enchiladas . 
  it 's this bland , milk taste that i 'm looking for . 
  also here in the netherlands . 
  and is just half the price ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  manpower 100000000, 
  just came to say that netherlands  finland . 
  russians and islamics , it 's the ultimate combo of homophobia . 
  take that finland !,
