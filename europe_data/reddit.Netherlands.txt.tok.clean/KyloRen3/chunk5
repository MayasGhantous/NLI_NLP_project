  i 'm from mexico and came to the netherlands to study a research master and then a phd . 
  it is * shit * for your standards , but it is very livable when compared to my country where the scientist are paid even shittier . 
  but what i like the most about europe is not the money , it 's the life quality ( self-explanatory i think ) and the working culture . 
  in mexico and the us ( not sure about canada ) , you live to work and you 're nothing more than a pawn . 
  you 're supposed to work unpaid after hours otherwise * you 're a lazy bastard * . 
  in here it 's 17:00 and everybody goes to their house to have their own lives . 
  i do n't have to work on saturdays or sundays . 
  in mexico we get 5 days of vacations ** per year ** . 
  it 's the small things that really make a difference . 
  and to be fair , i 'd rather have ugly concrete cubes than the housing shortage and price bubbles that we have right now . 
  the list for finding a house can be over 10 years here in the netherlands . 
  i cry . 
  trying to remove the sacred porn . 
  no thanks . 
  if it 's outside of [ the allowed fun hours ] ( http://imgur.com/eheu90i ) , then no . 
  is n't it measured in kg ? 
  volume/temperature/pressure are closely related and they will change if one of the other variables change . 
  kg stays constant . 
  however , i 've never bought helium . 
  can someone eli5 me why is corbyn so hated by some groups ? 
  i 've seen people even call him a terrorist . 
  netherlands : i know of funda.nl , but there 's many other websites for social housing . 
  2\u00a03/4 teaspoon of baking powder and 3\u00a02/3 tablespoon of sugar . 
  confusing as hell . 
  why not just use ml . 
  [ goedendag , surprise polder . 
  ** house of orange intensifies **, 
  groningen , netherlands , should be super red . 
  got ta love gas extraction . 
  you can get your passport stamped by them in the tourist office !, 
  you 're right , but i was thinking in the industrialization of agriculture . 
  the green revolution actually . 
  it 's natural selection against drowning until we finish poldering the north sea . 
  wow . 
  people were short back then before industrialization . 
  [ hidden inside the wikipedia article ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_naming_customs#/media/file%3aspanish_surnames_by_province_of_residence.png ), 
  \u221e +1 is still \u221e . 
  til . 
  and i 'm amazed by italy and france , never knew . 
  garc\u00eda , mart\u00ednez , fernandez , rodr\u00edguez ... and their cousin mohamed . 
  another beautiful statistic where netherlands  finland . 
  poe 's law ... too strong ... 
  with a population of 320m , there 's enough room for surprises . 
  apparently the french government tried to [ reduce the amount of wifi signals in public spaces because they could be hazardous ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2015/01/29/une-loi-pour-encadrer-l-exposition-aux-ondes_4565339_3244.html#meter_toaster ) ( i.e. 
  : cancer ), 
  all countries should follow this model . 
  but of course in norway works better because the electricity is clean . 
  on the other hand here in the netherlands ... 
  ** laughs in dutch **, 
  ceiling 10/10 , would look at it again . 
  * stares at germany *, 
  even better - accept debit card in every single business . 
  forming spain militarily . 
  i 've never been there so it is interesting to read this , i 've only heard holidays stories indeed . 
  can you elaborate more ? 
  why is it such a bad place ? 
  i 'm from mexico , where the american products are very well blended into the society . 
  when i started living in the netherlands , i was really amazed to see that supermarkets have shelves of american products . 
  small stuff like microwave popcorn and betty crockers are priced like imported delicacy . 
  cultural differences are fun . 
  in my experience the american donuts are a-m-a-z-i-n-g , especially compared to the ones i 've had in europe . 
  of course you can find good donuts in both places , but it was easier to find good donuts in ` merica . 
  loved the tiny catalu\u00f1as sleeping . 
  a better solution is to teach dutch language in combination with the english degree . 
  you can not expect people to already know a less common language such as dutch or the nordic ones , but you can prepare students during their degree to integrate them into the labor force when they graduate . 
  in my experience ( as an expat ) it has been expensive , difficult but very necessary if you want a job anywhere . 
  or how i pronounce it with my broken dutch , hoertoeslag ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  depends on what you do and your luck !, 
  i 'm gon na do the phd so that 's another 4 years here . 
  i think working in science is very friendly for foreigners . 
  afterwards , there 's the high skilled migrant visa . 
  but who knows , one might end up meeting a special someone , 
  the habsburg never left . 
  if you 're a student it 's very easy and straightforward , the university helps you . 
  if you want to do something else it can get more difficult . 
  i know families who can not reconnect because they do n't meet the requirements for the visa ( your partner needs a high enough salary ) . 
  i also have friends who can not find a job ( especially non-eu people ) . 
  drug innovation in groningen . 
  ^ drugs . 
  ^ mexican . 
  each country has its good things  while mexico has nice weather and better food , netherlands has better work opportunities and overall life quality . 
  `` we change some things for others '' we say in my country . 
  doing a whole master and then perhaps the phd !, 
  hopefully i 'll be here for long . 
  it 's a very nice place to live in , 
  as far as i know , yes . 
  and i can only buy in the dutch store since i live here . 
  ( or maybe there 's a way to circumvent that but i do n't know ... ), 
  mexican living in the netherlands , 
  nintendo and play station store , where i can not even change the language even though i do n't speak dutch ( yet ! ), 
  til that tax in belgium is taks . 
  ( i 'm learning dutch , and this is pretty interesting ), 
  brabant , come here . 
  france has such beautiful places that are not as known as paris . 
  what an anticlimax :( i 'm curious to see what will happen . 
  is alcohol easy and cheap to get in turkey ? 
  i would think the majorly muslim population would decrease the offer/demand and increase the prices . 
  i have no idea , but wikipedia says they need 289 for a majority . 
  i seriously love all the pictures you post !, 
  exactly my point .
