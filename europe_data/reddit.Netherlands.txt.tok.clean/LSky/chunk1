why is that ? 
  woah woah , why spoil a perfectly fine comment section with these facts ? 
  did that guy just block the right lane to record a video ? 
  not terrorist . 
  are they ( mass ) killing civilians in order to punish a government ? 
  if they 're not , you might want to reflect more carefully on using that phrase , it might not be appropriate in such a situation . 
  stop stretching the meaning of the word terrorist . 
  you 're not doing your cause any favors . 
  this seems like the right approach . 
  never seen one in my life . 
  maybe i need to get out more . 
  why not ? 
  no numbers for belgium and the netherlands ? 
  it 's not really a great picture to be honest . 
  depends on where you come from i suppose . 
  why not ? 
  cool . 
  got a link for us ? 
  sssssh !, 
  this is not what people here want to hear !, 
  i 'm not at all talking about the financial aspects . 
  i agree that we actually need immigrants to stay afloat economically , although that view does heavily rely on the fact that economic growth is the end goal . 
  that 's something i do n't agree with . 
  i 'm referring to the cultural impact that immigrants have on the netherlands . 
  you can see it with the rise of the right wing parties like the lpf and the pvv , the worst of the immigrants also bring out the worst of the dutch people . 
  i do n't see why putting breaks on immigration is not at least part of the solution . 
  what are you basing this on ? 
  make sure you do n't mistake the rants of a far right politician for our immigration policy . 
  they 're not the same thing . 
  everyone wants to help people out , but a small country like the netherlands can only take on so many immigrants . 
  it might not be a popular opinion in this subreddit , but the simple fact is that immigrants cause trouble in the netherlands because many of them refuse to integrate in our culture . 
  we already accept a lot of immigrants and i have no issue at all with allowing people from conflict zones to stay here , but there 's limits that we 've set and if those are n't compatible with people 's wishes , then they should seek asylum elsewhere . 
  we take our part of the responsibility and we 'll decide how large that part is . 
  i must say they 're not particularly original labels . 
  weed , pimps , gays and tulips . 
  alright then . 
  reddit is a private entity and it moderates speech and allows moderators to do the same . 
  freedom of speech does n't apply . 
  maybe he 's referring to europe and australia , not the us . 
  i was going to reply in support of turkey 's decision to shoot down the russian plane , but apparently we 're all bigots . 
  thanks , random internet guy . 
  i honestly do n't understand how anyone would user tinypic , imageshack or photobucket . 
  that 's the real tragedy here . 
  wait , what subreddit am i in ? 
  they clearly lack the enforcement part . 
  but before the lse opens ? 
  not sure if thats a great idea . 
  i immediately remembered the american congresswoman ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gabrielle_giffords, 
  you just vote for one person . 
  article is in dutch ; the first sanctions proposed are visas to business travelers and politicians if bangladesh refuses to make agreements about returning refugees . 
  future sanctions could include limitations of textile imports . 
  i dont think this data represents what ` should be prioritized ' in any way . 
  well i didnt mean to be offensive . 
  im just expressing my views . 
  if someone says they lean towards agnosticism and dont believe and/or disbelieve , it pretty much comes down to lacking a belief . 
  this falls perfectly into the ` weak atheism ' category and as such choosing atheism in the survey shouldnt present issue . 
  you have every right to declare whatever you like . 
  i 'm just pointing out that it might not be neccesarily accurate . 
  i suggest you look up gnostic and agnostic atheism , you might find that the situation is a little more complex than `` i am not sure , and as such i am agnostic but not atheistic . '', 
  agnosticism doesnt deal with beliefs , thats not something i personally decided . 
  read up . 
  sure i can . 
  i define atheism as the lack of belief , not disbelief . 
  theres plenty of good material where you can read up on the definition of atheism . 
  youll find that what i use isnt uncommon . 
  i 'm interested to see the results but in more than just the diagrams . 
  it would be nice to have information about what nationals like/dislike rather than just what all participants combined have answered . 
  you lack belief and thus atheism fits perfectly . 
  agnosticism deals with what you know , not with what you believe . 
  remind me , who elected these people into the spanish congress ? 
  i 've lived in that town for 15 years , i did n't expect anything like this to happen . 
  which city is that in the north of the netherlands ? 
  the netherlands * two tickets to the dark knight rises , maybe a drink as well * not very far with the taxi , maybe 15km * halfway the country by train * perhaps 60-100km by bus , depending on zones * 8m/1m basic internet ( cheapest all in one is over 40 euros ) * takeaway or delivery dinner for two without drinks , pizza 's are cheaper,

  this was widely reported in the dutch media this/last week because the holidays just started here . 
  a lot of dutch people will make the trip by car to ( or through ) france . 
  you need an alcohol test as of this month as well . 
  also , you ca n't use radar detectors and you have to shut down any navigation system functionality that tells you where the speed cameras are located . 
  that last one has a 1500 euro fine i believe , but that might not be enforced until the end of the year . 
  you can get by in the netherlands without learning dutch just fine . 
  today i learned poland/lithuania were a big deal for like 7 centuries . 
  well the fact that its an island does kind of help . 
  i think hong kong is more likely , he did n't move to nz until later on . 
  i 'm pretty sure i saw a news article about the most expensive mansion in nz being sold only a few years ago . 
  when in the course of a single month , only 30,000 tuned into the channel i think it is safe to say that it should be scrapped . 
  i guess kim schmitz to kim dotcom was not a problem ? 
  it 's the center-right christian democrats ( [ cda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_democratic_appeal ) ) that are behind this effort , they [ expressed happiness ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.l1.nl/nieuws/179582-fractievoorzitter-cda-tevreden-over-invoering-wietpas ) about the introduction of the so called wietpas ( a membership card for shops that sell marijuana , unobtainable by foreigners ) . 
  the other ( and largest ) party of our ( former ) government that introduced this plan , [ the vvd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vvd ) is not extraordinarily happy about it , although they will not say so on a national level . 
  their youth movement has already [ expressed discontent ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.spitsnieuws.nl/archives/binnenland/2012/05/vvd-jeugd-opent-meldpunt-tegen-wietpas ) though , but also local vvd politicians such as [ those in amsterdam ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.vvdamsterdam.nl/danielvanderree/article/3354/ ) . 
  i tried to find a statement from the [ pvv ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_for_freedom ) ( [ geert wilders ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geert_wilders ) ' party ) but while i am pretty sure they supported this measure , i think they are careful enough to let the other two parties take the heat for this . 
  following the collapse of the former government ( cda+vvd supported by pvv ) there has been a vague new coalition of sorts , although it is not an established cabinet . 
  this includes center-left/pro europe [ d66 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democrats_66 ) and left-wing/green party [ groenlinks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groenlinks ) , who would [ never ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.d66.nl/d66nl/nieuws/20120508/vvd_cda_brengen_drugs_bij_u_in_de?ctx=vghpm7u9vdea ) back such measures . 
  not a single word was said about this wietpas project in the deal that was made and my projection is that if a government is formed ( after the elections this fall ) without the pvv , which is exceptionally likely , the law will probably be turned back ,, 
  i believe that with upcoming elections , vvd and especially cda will probably try to avoid that . 
  the government that imposed those laws collapsed last month , with a little luck that nonsense will be reverted by the next government after the elections in september . 
  for comedic purposes , i see no issue with making things appear a bit more extreme than they really are . 
  this is not a news show . 
  it does n't actually . 
  his facts are usually quite in order , but from the comments in this thread it appears to me that people here are simply unfamiliar with the humor of the daily show . 
  can you explain what kinds of web links he ought to read ?
