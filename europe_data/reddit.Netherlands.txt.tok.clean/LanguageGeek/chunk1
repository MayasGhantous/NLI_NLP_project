i pay half of what you pay , which means i pay less than you . 
  a little more than 50 % is still less than 100 % . 
  it 's also a dutch flag , but i know prices from the netherlands , belgium and france pretty well and they 're not too different ( netherlands is a little cheaper than the other two ) . 
  last one that served 4 full years was the first government under prime minister kok ( aka paars 1 ) , 1994-1998 . 
  the second government under kok ( paars 2 ) , with the same parties , fell less than a month before the elections , 1998-2002 . 
  and to the non-dutch people : yes , his real name was kok . 
  and it 's basically pronounced the way you think it is . 
  thank you , for the cheapest brand i pay about half of that . 
  maybe a little more than half . 
  ^ ( edit : added `` than half '' for clarity ), 
  yeah , milk is n't sold per gallon in europe . 
  afaik the only place gallons are used are petrol stations in the uk . 
  i 'm still surprised there is no direct relation between french and dutch , a lot of words in the dutch language are french or come from french . 
  and i do n't think dutch has many more words of greek origin than german of english have ( both of those do n't have a direct connection with greek ) . 
  because whenever there 's a little wind germany has overproduction and they give us their surplus for free or for less than it costs to produce our own . 
  sometimes they even pay us to take the excess energy off their hands !, 
  ( [ source in german ] ( https://www.rp-online.de/wirtschaft/warum-deutschland-so-viel-strom-exportiert-aid-1.3295701 ) / [ google translated version ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rp-online.de%2fwirtschaft%2fwarum-deutschland-so-viel-strom-exportiert-aid-1.3295701 ) ), 
  in the netherlands there 's a pretty strong east/west divide . 
  statistics netherlands ( cbs ) has some maps : [ unemployment/disabilities ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/themas/arbeid-sociale-zekerheid/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2012/2012-3592-wm.htm ) and [ income ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/inkomen-bestedingen/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2008/2008-2407-wm.htm ) . 
  thanks a lot , germany . 
  ( of course this is relative since we 're pretty high on op 's map . 
  and the north east is clearly worst off , but a lot of dutch money is earned there too thanks to natural gas and oil . ), 
  there 's a difference between production and consumption , and there 's a difference between electricity and energy . 
  translation : * black is a nuclear power plant in use * red is a nuclear power plant that 's not in use * green is a nuclear power plant under construction * the colors of the countries themselves represent the percentage of total energy * consumption in 2009 . 
  \\* i think this is an error and supposed to be electricity . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrie_nucl%c3%a9aire_en_france ) nuclear electricity represented about 18.4 % of energy consumption in france in 2004 . 
  there 's also / r/binnenhof for politics in the netherlands . 
  not quite as artistic , but i liked it : [ `` fifa , go fuck yourself !, 
  '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vnhhneq.jpg ) in porto , portugal a few months ago ( before blatter announced his resignation ) . 
   robeke ( `` roubaix '' ) roubaix in flemish is `` robaais '' , `` robeke '' is robecq . 
  in normal dutch it 's much easier : roubaix = roubaix and robecq = robecq . 
  ^ this is the actual dutch name for calais . 
  although i do n't think anyone in the netherlands has used it this century ( or the previous one ) . 
  flanders likes to hold on to these misspellings though . 
  10 years ago an 18 year old american girl disappeared while on vacation on aruba . 
  her body still has n't been found and it 's unclear what exactly happened to her . 
  it got a lot of attention in the us , and in the netherlands too because the prime suspect was born in gelderland , ( he moved to aruba at age 3 ) and of course because it 's part of the kingdom . 
  because it was in the news for years pretty regularly almost everyone in the netherlands knows her name . 
  [ more info about the disappearance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disappearance_of_natalee_holloway ) her name is natalee holloway . 
  the joke name for aruba is natalee hollandway . 
  i think you can figure it out from there . 
  i often reluctantly do the same in spanish . 
  95 % of people do n't even know what `` pa\u00edses bajos '' or `` neerland\u00e9s '' is and sometimes it 's just easier to not start a whole discussion or have to answer a tsunami of questions . 
  i do use the correct term as often as i can , however . 
  and i have helped converting most of spanish wikipedia to the correct usage . 
  eventually that will pay off !, 
  too soon ? 
  not one from the region of holland . 
  i dislike the term `` holland '' for the whole country , i will not use it that way myself ( [ except as a joke ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e1j41/euler_diagram_of_the_kingdom_of_the_netherlands/ctapwx7?context=1 ) ) , but will not be offended if someone else does . 
  saint martin/sint maarten was not part of the * country * of the netherlands in recent history . 
  it used to be part of the netherlands antilles , which was a country within the kingdom of the netherlands . 
  the kingdom of the netherlands and france share a border like they used to . 
  the three islands that became countries are the most populated ones ( [ details ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_netherlands#countries ) ) , but they are small countries of course . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the country of the netherlands effectively supports the other countries in the kingdom . 
  and the kingdom is responsible for things like defense in all four countries . 
  the countries just have some more freedom in making their own laws . 
  the abc islands and sss islands are separate because of their location : [ ** map ** ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:dutch_caribbean_location_map.svg ) . 
  the bottom ones off the coast of venezuela are the abc islands . 
  the top ones closer to puerto rico are the sss islands . 
  the name `` bes islands '' is new ( only exists since the dissolution of the netherlands antilles ) . 
  i 'm not sure why they chose for the e there , but i think because then `` bes '' has one syllable whereas `` bss '' has three or just an awkward sound . 
  it could also be that they wanted to prevent `` bs '' from appearing in the abbreviation or to distinguish it more from the sss islands . 
  or a combination . 
  or something else entirely . 
  as i said , i do n't know . 
  there 's `` n\u00e9erlandais '' in french which is the preferred adjective and preferred name for the dutch language . 
  similarly , spanish has `` neerland\u00e9s '' , portuguese has `` neerland\u00eas '' , italian has `` neerlandese '' and `` nederlandese '' , romanian has `` neerlandez '' and catalan has neerland\u00e8s . 
  [ how do you like this ? 
  merci !, 
  * thank you !, 
  i am very sorry to have made a terrible mistake like this anglicism ; i have corrected it . 
  with the ov chipkaart you can get on any bus , tram , metro and train in the netherlands . 
  that the buses in different regions are different companies is barely noticeable beyond the different coloring ( at least in my experience the differences between de lijn , tec and stib are way more noticeable ) . 
  by the way , in flanders there are also multiple companies , they just all ride in name of de lijn ( not noticeable at all unless you are aware of it ) . 
  i would argue that quality is worse , but in both the netherlands and belgium i 've mostly stayed in the less dense areas . 
  my experience is way more dial-a-bus ( belbus ) lines , almost no ( regular ) service in the weekends , combined local and express buses ( in particular bus 20a hasselt-maastricht , possibly the worst bus line in history , this is related to urban planning , but in similar areas in the netherlands there would be both a local line serving all the little villages and an express service serving only a few stops between the two large cities ) . 
  [ caribe neerland\u00eas ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/caribe_neerland\u00eas ) refers to the six islands in the caribbean belonging to the kingdom of the netherlands , like in the euler diagram . 
  [ pa\u00edses baixos caribenhos ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa%c3%adses_baixos_caribenhos ) ( or , like you said , cara\u00edbas holandesas ) only refers to the three islands part of the country of the netherlands . 
  they can also be called the munic\u00edpios especiais or ilhas bes , like i did in my euler diagram . 
   no one wants belgium to join the netherlands , i certainly do not either . 
  i literally responded to someone arguing that the benelux should become one country . 
  it seems we agree on most of your other points . 
  however , i am curious why you think flanders has better bus transport than the netherlands . 
  my experience living in hasselt using de lijn somewhat regularly has been different . 
  it 's cheaper , sure , but that 's not my primary concern . 
  i responded to someone arguing for the benelux to become a single country , and i focused on belgium in my arguments against . 
  that 's true . 
  but the way i see it most of them would still be valid when talking about flanders : * terrible traffic in almost every way for transport modes from bicycles to trains . 
  * terrible urban planning * language difficulties ( if it 's just flanders : what to do with brussels and with the [ belgian version of the special municipalities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/municipalities_with_language_facilities ) ? ), 
  * lack of ability to produce enough power in winter ( most of the power stations including the largest are in wallonia , so the problems might be even worse for flanders alone ) * terrible internet ( traffic shaping and usage caps happen in flanders too ) . 
  the others ( prison pop , immigration & integration , gdp/cap , ppp/cap ) i ca n't really find data on for flanders alone . 
  of course some of these are because belgium as a whole made these decisions , but i still stand by my point that i will repeat and translate below . 
  i do n't think of belgium or flanders as a third world country in any way and i 'm sure there are areas where belgium and/or flanders do better than the netherlands , but i think that the netherlands has plenty of problems on its own without adding flanders ' . 
  you might be interested to know that i recently [ argued against the anschlu\u00df of belgium/flanders to the ( kingdom of the ) netherlands ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/39w0a6/benelux_moet_%c3%a9%c3%a9n_land_vormen_voor_treinverkeer/cs74x7q?context=1 ) ( in dutch ) . 
  each of them held a referendum , three wanted to be countries and three wanted to be special municipalities . 
  we just gave them what they wanted . 
  [ way more details on this wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissolution_of_the_netherlands_antilles ), 
  i think non-english uk citizens are more upset with you calling them english than non-hollanders are about calling them hollanders . 
  many dutch people do n't care , about as many dutch people do n't like it being called holland , but few people will actually be offended . 
  to be safe i would recommend using `` netherlands '' , especially in formal contexts , and it will always be my preference , but do n't worry too much if a `` holland '' slips out .
