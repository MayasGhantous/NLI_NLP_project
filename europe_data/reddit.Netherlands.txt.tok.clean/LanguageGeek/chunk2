  ------ right now the dutch caribbean are `` overseas countries and territories '' ( oct ) so they are part of the kingdom of the netherlands but not of the european union , yet owing to their dutch nationality , its citizens are citizens of the european union . 
  the bes islands will later this year request to be official outermost regions instead . 
  the separate countries might some day request this too , but seem to not have decided yet .

  thanks for the gemeinden one , that 's just me being stupid . 
  also thanks for pointing out the case screwup . 
  that 's me being stupid and the german language being stupid . 
  edited the link to a corrected version . 
  i made it for fun , hoping it would be used in internet discussions for years to come , but i was considering adding it to wikipedia too after i finished it . 
  would i really be a / u/languagegeek if i did n't provide some translations ? 
  close enough .

  i used urban areas because that is available for all these cities from one source and is a very logical way of defining a city imo . 
  you probably already expected this , but why only those countries ? 
  and what happens if i select a country ? 
  do i only receive alerts from that country or also airports in neighboring countries ? 
  what happens if i select ` other ' ? 
  can you make it possible to select multiple countries ? 
  when i lived in spain ( andaluc\u00eda ) a few years ago and said that i 'm from los pa\u00edses bajos or that i 'm neerland\u00e9s , the majority still did n't know what country i 'm from . 
  transportation sciences ( in dutch : * mobiliteitswetenschappen * ( formerly * verkeerskunde * ) ), 
  as a dutch student in belgium , yes . 
  it 's mostly tuition that 's lower . 
  this year it was about $ 650/year compared to $ 1900/year in the netherlands . 
  next year it will probably be around $ 900 vs $ 1950 . 
  ^ ( edit : in flanders !, 
  in belgium education is a responsibility of the ) [ ^ community ^ governments ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communities,_regions_and_language_areas_of_belgium#communities ) ^ ( , not the federal one ) housing is a bit cheaper in be , groceries a bit cheaper in nl . 
  cheaper housing comes at a price : almost never a washing machine ( belgian students go home every weekend , much more than dutch ) . 
  health insurance is more expensive in be if you count the dutch `` zorgtoeslag '' , but you can keep your dutch insurance and `` zorgtoeslag '' if you study/live abroad but do n't work abroad . 
  in the end how much cheaper it is depends on how much you 'll spend on traveling . 
  your free public transportation is only in the netherlands , but you can choose to receive $ 90/month extra study financing instead . 
  $ 90/month probably wo n't buy you train tickets to your parents every week and it definitely is n't enough for a car . 
  but i can do laundry at a laundromat and just go home once a month ( or less ) and i spend even less than the $ 90 per month . 
  of course you can count the extra time you 'll spend traveling in which case you will quickly lose money the further you are from belgium . 
  for me , as a northerner , it would n't really be worth it for the money . 
  but i 'm not here for the money : no dutch university offers the programme that i 'm following . 
  can confirm . 
  i work in france and there are quite a few places that still accept francs . 
  i also asked about it when i saw francs on my receipt . 
  have n't seen that with guilders in over 10 years . 
  i think the french like ancient methods of payment . 
  the cheque is still extremely popular too . 
  in the netherlands they 've been almost non-existent for 20 years , but in france you see them everywhere and i even recently received a cheque from my employer ( and it cost me more to exchange it than the value of it ( around $ 25 ) , fuck cheques ) . 
  i prefer not to say the exact one , but it was in the state of new york . 
  i 'm sure the kitchen and bathroom layouts differ per campus . 
  after all , on ` my ' campus the layout was different for different buildings and sometimes even different depending on the floor of the building . 
  on my floor a bathroom was shared between 2 rooms , but on the floor below mine ( same building ) they all shared a large bathroom . 
  still , the room sharing seems pretty universal across the us . 
  that does n't seem right for adults living in a developed country . 
  the main thing i disliked was the dorms . 
  sharing a room with strangers is unheard of in the netherlands . 
  i imagine it 'd be pretty much impossible to study because of the distractions . 
  it 's pretty common as a student to share an apartment here , but you still have your own bedroom and you just share a bathroom and/or kitchen . 
  my dorm building did n't even have a kitchen . 
  there was a kitchen for general use somewhere in another dorm . 
  most student living facilities here have at least a basic kitchen , and it 's not uncommon for students to live in a studio apartment with their own kitchen . 
  another thing that bothered me was : why are some ( or most ? ), 
  campuses so far away from everything else ? 
  it does n't make sense to me . 
  at least my location required every single staff member and every student not living in the dorms to own a car , because there was basically no other way to get there . 
  this then requires huge amounts of space to park all these cars and people have to walk large distances from their car to the campus itself . 
  there was a permanent taxi stand at my campus for other people to get away ( or to go to the hospital ! ) . 
  but between the town and the campus there was nothing , so what was the point of moving it so far away ? 
  if you had it within walking distance from the town , people could arrive by train , and people would n't need a car or taxi . 
  it just proved to me how insanely car-centric the us was . 
  land may have been cheaper there , but you would need much less land if the campus were accessible by train and you would n't have to park so many cars . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  it 's definitely legal to bring computer parts in your checked luggage . 
  some might look a little bit like a bomb to an untrained eye , but i think they can see there are no explosives ( which i assume is pretty essential for a bomb ) . 
  maybe take into account that they might open up your suitcase by making it easy for personnel to access ( leave suitcase unlocked , computer parts on top ) and handing in your luggage early ( so you and your suitcase wo n't miss the flight ) . 
  if you really want to make sure it 's legal to bring them , call the airport . 
  when i moved across countries i decided that it was too costly and/or too inconvenient to move it . 
  i checked out international moving companies and regular shipping companies and they all charged several hundreds of euros . 
  that was n't worth it for me . 
  i considered disassembling the pc and bringing the parts ( maybe not the case ) , and reassemble it ( with a new case ) at the destination . 
  it can save a lot of space and if you wrap each part in a towel or something they can be transported safely in a suitcase . 
  maybe that 's an option for you . 
  since you have already bought a plane ticket and seeing the distance , the train or the bus are probably not options for you . 
  i considered to travel by train because you can bring as much luggage as you want and you hold the luggage yourself so it 'll be handled with much more care ( whereas plane luggage is thrown around freely ) . 
  i dislike buses over long distances , but they have similar advantages for luggage . 
  maybe i 'm wrong and it is an option for you . 
  i finally brought the pc to my parents ' house and bought a laptop . 
  maybe an even better option would be to sell the pc . 
  i 'm sure history is an aspect too , but were basque country and catalonia the only spanish regions that were oppressed ? 
  i 've never heard of a galician or andalusian secession movement ... 
  i think you 're underestimating the economical aspect . 
  i often hear that catalonia is the richest region of spain , and flanders is currently richer than wallonia . 
  an example that agrees with my point could be friesland ( or frysl\u00e2n ) in the netherlands . 
  just like catalonia , they have their own language but everyone speaks the national language . 
  frisian is an official language in friesland but not in e.g. 
  holland or zeeland and it 's not used in the national parliament . 
  there are some cultural differences too , a few sports that are only popular there for example . 
  it 's nothing major and i do n't know how that compares to catalonia . 
  however , friesland is definitely not the richest region of the country . 
  they have enough agriculture to `` feed the world '' ( the province 's slogan ) so they might even be able to survive as a separate country , but most money of the netherlands is earned in groningen ( largest natural gas field of european mainland ) and holland ( ports , airports , business , tourism ) . 
  i think that plays a part in why there is n't a real secession movement ( none of the political parties , not even the `` frisian national party '' , support secession ) . 
  and i know at least in belgium , the secession movement is trying to portray the walloons as people living off of welfare paid by the flemish , more than they 're saying that the walloons are so different . 
  belgium has some beautiful historic cities ( bruges , ghent ) and some good beer ( mostly the darker ones ) . 
  if your wife likes modern architecture rotterdam could be good . 
  a lot of it was bombed in world war ii so almost everything in the centre relatively modern , good contrast with amsterdam . 
  aachen is also supposed to be beautiful , and close to both belgium and the netherlands .
