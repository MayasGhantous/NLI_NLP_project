whey cheese where the sugar caramelizes , giving the brown color . 
  brunost made from goats milk is absolutely delicious !, 
  [ remeker ] ( https://www.remeker.nl/remekernew2/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mg_8764.jpg ) is the best , although we have many more excellent cheeses like old gouda , beemster , veenendaler goat cheese and many others . 
  i once met this [ cherry queen ] ( https://www.lokalo24.de/bilder/2017/01/24/7319623/1638187793-kirschenkoenigin-witzenhausen-1qa7.jpg ) in witzenhausen . 
  in the netherlands , opposition to vaccination is strongly correlated with the fundamentalist dutch reformed church , leading to epidemics of preventable diseases in those regions , most recently measles in 2013 . 
  that one is second from left , bottom row . 
  some [ town in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/condom,_gers ) , i guess . 
  and the real red-white-blue one is n't even included . 
  they both view europe through a british lens which very much colors their reporting , though . 
  not very , the ones i 've seen tend to be superficial and clickbaity . 
  it might be different for different countries , though . 
   he 's been the victim of arson attacks from radical jewish groups alleged arson attack . 
  i 've read on the internet that it was a right-wing conspiracy to elicit sympathy for holocaust deniers . 
  both the hussite museum and the underground passages in tabor ( a lot like a real-life d&d dungeon ) are worth visiting . 
  it was not as if bicycles had completely gone , but the infrastructure was very car-centric at the time . 
  [ same street in amsterdam in the 1970 's and now ] ( https://media.treehugger.com/assets/images/2015/05/amsterdam.jpg.662x0_q70_crop-scale.jpg ) . 
  wonderful books , i love corto maltese . 
  people use to duel newspaper editors . 
  takes a fraction of a second to say and is a wonderfully unambiguous word . 
  van dongen is relatively unknown in the netherlands , he is seen more as a french painter . 
  they picked that one ? 
  come on , van dongen is more french then dutch . 
  what 's the use of spending millions on your monarchy and then * not * obsess about them ? 
  kind of defies the purpose . 
  i 've not even seen the movie , but the morbid atmosphere of the comics would be hard to film . 
  you have a point there . 
  the comic or the movie ? 
  bosnia is crying right now . 
  yes , we have life-long imprisonment and a tbs long-stay for prisoners where psychiatric treatment is deemed to be useless . 
  there are about 42 people with life imprisonment , and about 200 people in tbs long stay . 
  another thing is that they meet more criminals in prison . 
  it is a strong though not universally shared sentiment in the netherlands at least . 
  prison sentences are sparingly given here because research showed that in many cases they worsened the outcomes , so judges started looking into alternatives like community service and electronic monitoring . 
  they can read what they want , apart from pornography and books on making bombs and stuff like that . 
  apparently , true crime books and books about sports are among the most popular . 
  also authors like john grisham , dan brown , david baldacci , mario puzo , and baantjer ( dutch crime fiction author ), 
  yes , we have closed , half-open and open prisons , as well as special terrorist sections and tbs clinics . 
  tbs is forensic mental care , which is only used for serous crimes . 
  contrary to normal sentencing , tbs can be extended indefinitely if judges and psychologists decide that a person remains a danger to society . 
  edit : we also have special prisons for people who have committed a lot of less serious criminal acts and have already repeatedly been convicted to prison , like addicts who steal small amounts every day to finance their addiction . 
  however even high security prisoners get electronics , although they can be taken away as punishment for bad behavior . 
  in the netherlands , prisoners can have televisions and gaming devices , but internet access is prohibited . 
  pornographic videos and literature are also prohibited . 
  parts of the daily programs such as sports are compulsory . 
  one hour of visit weekly ( no body contact ) , 10 minutes of telephone weekly . 
  towards the end of their sentence ( if they showed good behavior ) prisoners are moved to less-strict half-open prisons ( for the last 1.5 year ) and open prisons ( for the last six months ) to prepare them for their return to society . 
  fff, 
  they are nato themselves . 
  covering your hair was definitely the christian thing to do for women , it persists in some conservative protestant places to this day in the netherlands . 
   i was born in the most beautiful city in the world . 
  even if your father , child , was the richest man in the world , he could not take you to see it , because it does not exist any more . 
  in a thousand years was her beauty built , in one night was it utterly destroyed . 
  the location was a bit in the middle of nowhere at the time so making fortifications would have been superfluous . 
  nope , even the wageningse berg is higher . 
  uh , there are no rocks in noord-brabant ? 
  it has already been explored by famous adventurer zuid-holland jansen . 
  it they were , it would make sense they were * very * bored . 
   the belgian aristocracy did n't learn dutch during this period . 
  they still do n't . 
   his request to visit the netherlands was denied several times by king william i of the netherlands , but king william ii allowed him a visit in 1840 . 
  although traveling in the netherlands under a false name , some people found out that it was their former king , which led to a cheering crowd gathering under the window of his hotel room . 
  it is said that he was quite moved by this demonstration of affection from his former subjects . 
  they were all dutch at the time , as belgium did n't exist yet :-), 
  there were 17,000 dutch troops at waterloo , compare this to 25,000 british and 6,000 king 's german legion . 
  also , the prince of orange , future king william ii of the netherlands fought at quattre bras . 
   which is a weird foreign entity inside the nl posing as dutch sjei oet . 
  well it was the dutch who put [ this honking big thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lion%27s_mound ) on the waterloo battlefield . 
  we also have [ this one ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/naald_van_waterloo ) close to our former royal palace to commemorate the victory of waterloo . 
  it was a joke . 
  you forget the terrible fighting of the 1847 sonderbund war . 
  so is fear . 
  34 points out of 40 !, 
  i did spend three days in denmark this month , my first visit , and saw the towns of genner , hals , and hirtshals . 
  wrong answers : 15 ( i should have known green parties did n't exist in the 1970 's ) , 19 ( i misread it as danish parliament ) , 26 ( sorry , none of these christians mean anything to me ) , 32 ( never heard of these guys either ) , 35 ( again , a list of names unknown to me ) , 36 ( i rarely follow sports ) . 
  we actually build a piece of england too , it is called [ south holland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_holland,_lincolnshire ) . 
   being completely empty of any human construction hiding in a completely empty mudflat would have been hard . 
  actually it was being turned into agricultural ground and there were barracks for the workers , but the germans did n't check very thoroughly who was living there as long as they worked , so the abbreviation for noordoostpolder ( nop ) was said to stand for nederlands onderduikers paradijs ( dutch refugees/illegals paradise ) . 
  no , we do n't have school uniforms in the netherlands . 
  you are right , chamonix is in france . 
  it 's evidently wider spread then i though . 
  but the swiss have their own [ battaille des reines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxpifguhtds ) in the val d'h\u00e9rens .

  the beemster was a lake , not a swamp , [ that was turned into a polder in 1609-1612 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beemster ), 
  [ this is what happens to an unsecured windmill in a storm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lkri3clpg0 ), 
  enough wind and you do n't need sails , from the speed of the wings you can see it is rather windy .

  germaan, 
   is this real this is very real , it connects two parts of a protected nature area . 
   how does this work the water was previously tunneled * under * the road ( which was higher ) , but this prevents many aquatic animals from using it to move between habitats . 
   where does the water go ? 
  the netherlands is pumping 24/7 to remove excess water from low-lying areas . 
  that is the way the lowered highway stays dry . 
   is n't it dangerous to build ? 
  no , just add sufficient sheet piling . 
  [ picture during building ] ( https://www.wegenwiki.nl/bestand:eco-aquaduct_zweth_2014.jpg ), 
  no , murder rates are a lot higher in belgium then in the surrounding countries . 
  i would n't visit charlerois at night and not because i am afraid of terrorists .
