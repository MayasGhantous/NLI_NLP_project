  in moscow , we had one day to look around and we had to move on our own ( by subway ) from the yaroslavsky to the belorysskaya station , and book reservations for the part through poland and the gdr . 
  lots of different stuff . 
  most popular are acupuncture , homeopathy , chiropractics , osteopathy , natural healing , paranormal therapy and fytotherapy .
