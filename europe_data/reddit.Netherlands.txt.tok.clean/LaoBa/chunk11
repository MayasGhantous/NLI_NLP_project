  never heard of it . 
  sorry , i used to live in an [ uncivilized rural town ] ( https://als.wikipedia.org/wiki/z%c3%bcrich ) so i might have picked up some bad habits :-), 
  * italians : ice cream and pizza restaurants . 
  * turks and moroccans : oriental grocery stores * israeli 's and egyptians : shoarma restaurants . 
  * vietnamese : carts in the street selling spring rolls . 
  * somalis : selling qat from home . 
  pretty common in my town , there are second-hand clothes shops , free second hand clothes exchanges , and some schools organize a big second hand children 's clothes sale every year . 
  i notice that the higher educated people are , the less they care about clothes being second-hand .

  kast = cupboard , kastje is a small cupboard . 
  [ a few , yes ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/seriemoordenaar#seriemoordenaars_in_nederland ), 
  [ popularity of first name joran in the netherlands . 
  [ groenlinks ] ( https://groenlinks.nl/standpunten/koningshuis ) wants to eventually abolish the monarchy . 
  the sp ( to my surprise ) [ does n't mention this ] ( https://www.sp.nl/standpunt/koninklijk-huis ) in their program . 
  my mothers side of the family has one , with a hooked bar and a half moon . 
  netherlands is around 41 % brown and 40 % blonde . 
  some guys tried to start a party to lower the [ age of consent to 12 with no restrictions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_for_neighbourly_love,_freedom,_and_diversity ) and met with universal condemnation . 
  you voted on both . 
   abolishing conscription or the army altogether 21 % voted in favor . 
   eu membership 23 % voted in favor . 
  not popular , but not an absolute taboo either . 
   either abolishing our monarchy we had and have parties which want to do so . 
   i 've never met any . 
  geert wilders denies * human induced * climate change . 
  not italian , but i can say rome certainly did n't disappoint . 
  it 's such a wonderful mixture of buildings from all ages . 
  it also helped that we stayed in a beautiful apartment in trastevere with a friend who knew the city . 
  the nice thing here is that it is very much a private matter , so it often takes a long time to find out if and how religious your friends and colleagues are . 
  two people from my role-playing group are members of a conservative protestant church , for example . 
   what would your reaction be like if somebody ( young ) told you that they go to church every single week ? 
  nothing special . 
   would you treat or think about this person any differently ? 
  my parents in law go to church every week , but it a mennonite/baptist church which , funny enough , is a very open and progressive church in the netherlands because all the conservative mennonites and baptists have long left for other countries or switched to other churches . 
  they are n't very religious and do n't mind that daughter and i are atheists . 
  my mother used to be religious too . 
  the only ones that annoyed me were my great uncle and great aunt who were members of the [ moral re-armament ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral_re-armament ) movement , which is called initiatives for change these days . 
  they felt it their duty to witness at every family meeting , but apart from that they were sweet old people . 
  if a dutch video about cycling is posted on reddit , it 's always the americans commenting on no-one wearing helmets . 
  not a big fan . 
  it is pretty common here though . 
  goes pretty well with your username !, 
  dutch takeover is starting . 
  i saw [ this ] ( https://www.eric-maechler.ch/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/streetfood-festival-stgallen-2016-pommes-holland.jpg ) in switzerland . 
  from my father 's side i have a small family tree that goes back to around 1800 . 
  for my mothers side , a cousin traced the family back to about 1600 . 
  my wife 's family has some genealogies also back to the 18th century . 
  she gets invited sometimes to gatherings of all descendants of a woman who born around 1860 . 
  this woman was married twice so the descendants are two separate families , my wife is from the smaller one . 
  see some [ non-dutch mothers gushing about the dutch way of raising kids ] ( http://www.today.com/video/see-what-makes-dutch-children-the-happiest-in-the-world-917290051549 ) . 
  that being said , dutch kids are probably not the best behaved ones in restaurants . 
  because working together is much more likely to create mutually beneficial outcomes . 
  with 6 % muslims in the netherlands this is highly unlikely . 
  this species searches rotting and fermenting substrates for the larva of fruit flies to lay their eggs , so they are naturally attracted to these smells . 
  however , if they find larva in one substrate they will be more attracted to that smell for a while . 
  it turns out they can also learn smells ( like peppermint ) that have nothing to do with their natural preferences . 
  that you can teach parasitoid wasps ( [ this cutie ] ( http://charles-harvey.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/leptopilina-boulardi.jpg ) , * leptopinina boulardi * ) that a certain smell signifies more prey and that they can remember this for three days without reinforcement . 
  we could make them pick between rotting cabbage and yeasty carrot . 
  that malaria mosquitoes can do loopings when flying . 
  that if you place a number of bee hives next to each other , 10 % of young bees will eventually end up settling in other hives . 
  apparently , the bees guarding the entrance of hives will usually not let in bees from other hives but make an exception for those coming in with a lot of nectar and pollen . 
  and young bees are n't the best at recognizing their own hive . 
  we measured this by sticking little numbers to the back of young bees that were just hatched and could n't fly yet . 
  it looked like [ this ] ( http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/25/assets/images/raffles.jpg ) . 
  picture is not from our experiments . 
  that it is possible to separate [ males ] ( http://shop.agrimag.it/1362-thickbox_default/trichogramma-brassicae.jpg ) and [ females ] ( https://www.oekolandbau.de/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_trichogramma_evanescens_de1b197aa4.jpg ) * trichogramma brassicae * by sex without using any magnification , even though they are just 1/50 '' ( 0.5 millimeters ) long . 
  as for [ wollbachia bacteria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolbachia ) , that stuff is totally x-files . 
  to be honest , i tend to play [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsez5viwivq ) only at volume when alone . 
  i want to eat yo ' dick ( i do ) but i ca n't fuck up my nails ( i ca n't ) so i ` mma pick it up with chopsticks lol, 
  those were transit visas and you have to get them in reverse order , so first gdr , because you 'll only get the polish one when you can show you have the gdr transit visa . 
  then polish one because you can only get the ussr one if you have the polish visa , etc. 
  fortunately i was living in beijing so visiting for embassies was n't too much of a hassle , gdr , poland and mongolia ones took less than an hour each . 
  the ussr however took a week to issue their visa . 
  funny thing was that at that time ( 1988 ) polish people could travel all over the eastern block ( including china ) without a visa . 
  however , getting a passport was n't always easy for them . 
   all of us dutch people on reddit , the rest ? 
  not so much . 
  yes , italian ( gianna nannini , adriano celantano , modena city ramblers ) , chinese ( cui jian , na li ) , cantonese ( faye wong ) , japanese ( kaji meiko ) , mongolian ( camerton , nomin talst ) , russian , french ( coeur de pirate , i understand a bit there ) , hebrew , arab , icelandic . 
  also for regions : daar is mijn vaderland limburgs dierbaar oord !, 
  only the malaria mosquitoes !, 
  parasitoid wasps are cool .

  i did beijing , china to my hometown in the netherlands by public transport ( train ) , it was pretty easy once you had the visas ( mongolia , ussr , poland and gdr ) and the ticket , had to change trains only in moscow , berlin and utrecht . 
  we took a bus from yaroslavskaya to belorusski station in moscow . 
  canada of course !, 
  belgium too , but sometimes he 's a bit slow . 
  i used to be one . 
  behavioral entomologist . 
  so i studied behavior of parasitoid wasps , honeybees , and malaria mosquitoes . 
  if locals tell you they do n't believe in elves , they 're just shy . 
  also : * tell everyone white that zwarte piet is the most racist thing ever . 
  tell everyone black that they should just lighten up about zwarte piet . 
  * make anne frank jokes , we love those . 
  * greet people by saying `` hey , swamp german ! '', 
  ( moerasduitser , if you can pronounce it ) . 
  * never say amsterdam . 
  say `` dam '' to prove you 're not a clueless tourist . 
  * say `` 420 blaze it '' to everyone you meet . 
  * quote austin powers to break the ice . 
  in the netherlands , one console and ten games are allowed , but many more advanced consoles are prohibited .
