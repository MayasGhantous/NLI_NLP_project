  gamecubes are allowed . 
  dutch wines do n't have a very good price/quality ratio , i.e. 
  they are expensive for what you get , and they will be hard to get outside the country . 
  if you are a completist however , try landgoed overst auxerrois , ol diek cabernet regent or louwberg maastricht cuv\u00e9e xii - apostelhoeve . 
  i read about 100 books per year . 
  kalpa imperial by angelica gorodisher was a good read . 
  we held international hitch-hiking contests when i was a student , my brother fixed up a minibus and went camping all around southern europe with a couple of friends when he was 18 , some of my middle-aged friends now just have a general direction when they leave for summer vacation . 
  i do n't even have a car but we rent one for vacation and go camping and travelling around czechia , germany , scotland or southern france in the summer . 
  but hey , we 're not from the randstad . 
  pretty close , as both of my parents were born there when they were still colonies . 
  there are few bosnian , albanian , and tatar muslims here and people would probably not even know they were muslim . 
   i know that at least in the netherlands the emigration was heavily `` seceding '' protestant compared to the population as a whole . 
  also lots of indo 's ( dutch indonesians ) emigrated to the us after the war . 
  not to bad , i 've been using it for years to get to work in other cities , although that usually takes longer than driving . 
  however , i find being driven very relaxing . 
  we have n't owned a car for years although we do use carshare sometimes . 
  i 'd call my country both public transport and car friendly , unless you go to the city centers where parking is limited and very expensive . 
  we cook every day , maybe eat out once a month . 
  either me my wife or my daughter cooks a meal at home . 
  we eat pretty nice food , dutch , indonesian , swiss , chinese , hungarian , japanese , french , whatever we think of . 
  today we had noodles with spinach and bell peppers and fried tofu in teriyaki sauce . 
  well done . 
  it is n't something we think very much about . 
  north africa , north america , caribbean , asia , pacific islands . 
  many people i know have been outside europe , vacations to asian turkey , egypt or tunisia are very affordable here . 
  art nouveau/jugendstil/secession / stile liberty/modernisme/arts and crafts !, 
  i 'm from the netherlands , so apparently no . 
  liege was closest to my birthplace . 
  thanks for replying . 
  that 's pretty cool , if he has maastricht or sittard on the helmet he might have liberated my birthplace !, 
  in a democracy , you can start fighting for great dental care any day . 
  in a dictatorship , no way . 
  swissair was pretty good . 
  montgomery as liberator is n't really a big thing here , we mostly think of the canadians as liberators here , although the british , americans , poles , french and belgians were also involved . 
  my birthplace was liberated by the big red one in 1944 . 
  also roman stuff and [ 80-years war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdzn63hfbta ), 
  these days , not much , even the older generation was quite young when the war happened . 
  my parents in law lived through the occupation in the north and i never noticed any animosity against germany . 
  my own family did n't suffer any fatalities to the germans but some had to go into hiding or did forced labor in germany , but i never heard any anti-german sentiments . 
  my parents were life-long friends with germans they met in 1951 while studying . 
  my neighbor is a german woman who came to live in the netherlands in 1947 with dutch family as a young girl because the situation in germany was dire and she said she did n't face any hostility , probably because people did n't know she was german . 
  but although her dutch is excellent , she still has a german accent now so i assume most people * did * know . 
  if you live as close to the border as i did , it was very useful . 
  we went to germany quite often and being able to understand a bit was great . 
  i learned a lot of german from sandm\u00e4nnchen , die maus , trickfilmzeit mit adelheit and klimbim !, 
  [ twarres - w\u00ear bisto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=366ztb-2vbi ) was number one in the charts for 21 weeks , it is sung in frisian . 
   why would you do that ? 
  i mean , * we * have [ reasons ] ( http://www.dedokwerker.nl/images/fiets_03.jpg ) . 
  it 's a rural area with relatively high suicide numbers among young people . 
  [ norwegian prisoners actually prefer dutch prison ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2016/02/dutch-jail-popular-with-norwegian-prisoners-less-work-more-phone-time/ ), 
  [ a lot of stereotypes in a handy map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qyzbr8r.jpg ), 
  klimbim , yeah , i remember watching with the whole family !, 
  dutch , english , german , very rusty french , can understand swiss german , a tiny bit of chinese . 
   how on earth do you get a degree in ancient greek or hebrew ? 
  do n't you see where he hails from ? 
  i do n't really support unilateral actions by the us , and some of the us interventions were clearly very misguided and botched . 
  however , the us , as a superpower , has a bit of a damned if they do/damned if they do n't position . 
  like iraq : * the us is supporting saddam hussein , a dictator . 
  this guy is gassing his own people . 
  the us are monsters !, 
  * ok , the us is sanctioning iraq . 
  iraqi kids are starving !, 
  the us are monsters !, 
  * ok , the us is invading iraq . 
  lost of people die and the country is a mess . 
  the us are monsters !, 
   if it 's not worth paying for , it 's probably not worth doing . 
  visiting old people , helping take care of nature areas , helping at a sports club , all stuff that people should n't do unless they are paid for it . 
  i do feel a connection to our colonies , but that is because my parents were born in the east and west indies when they were still colonies . 
  by the way , the place where my mom was born was a dutch colony but english-speaking , and in the dutch east indies the great majority of the population did n't speak dutch either . 
  i think it was mentioned that lithuania was annexed by the soviet union , but that was it . 
  i 'm from the netherlands , middle-aged . 
  never heard of it . 
  i think eurosport shows golf , but i 'm not sure . 
  short translations of the rules for scattering ashes in amsterdam : on private ground when the owner allows it . 
  on municipal ground as long as you do n't create a nuisance or danger to others . 
  they suggest : * in open water . 
  * on grass ( not in a busy park ) . 
  * in a quite place not close to housing . 
  if you want to scatter ashes on a cemetery , you need their prior permission !, 
  it was at the time . 
  an american president resigning is definitely big news . 
  reaction ? 
  i just remember my parents getting ore and more curious with every revelation . 
  it was like a detective story , said my mom . 
   ice hockey i grew up in geleen and we had the smoke eaters !, 
   nfl europe still existed says it all . 
  as for baseball , it is a big thing in the tropical part of the netherlands , that 's how we got to be world champions !, 
  amazon.de has a lot . 
  i guess it is pretty close . 
   the dutch government is still kind of flirting with the subject the netherlands never had eugenic laws or forced sterilization . 
  ( we except during the nazi occupation , obviously ) . 
  well , except in hawaii :-), 
  there are many ones that i like , maastricht , apeldoorn , dordrecht , amsterdam , uzes , avignon , thorn , z\u00fcrich , edinburgh , rome , aigues-mortes to name just a few , but venice stands out for me . 
  caspar friedrich is one of my favorite painters , it was a treat when some of his work was in amsterdam . 
  not the most famous , but the [ self portrait ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/serebryakova_sefportrait.jpg/1200px-serebryakova_sefportrait.jpg ) by zinaida serebryakova is one of my favorites . 
  the [ opening ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/mfwuj ) of sora no woto is also ased on klimt paintings . 
  it comes close to scandinavian and german concepts but it 's not exactly the same . 
  [ an american 's take on the concept ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/life/welltraveled/features/2005/should_i_move_to_amsterdam/the_quest_for_gezellig.html ) . 
  gezelligheid is the feeling of well-being you get when everything is right , the place or the people , especially both .
