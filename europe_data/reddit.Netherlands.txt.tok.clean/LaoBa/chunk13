  it 's the feeling of drinking hot chocolate after skating , of having beers in a small neighborhood cafe , of playing a board-game with the whole family . 
  it does n't have to be special , normal is fine . 
  if people get a bit heated , we 'll say : `` hey , let 's keep it * gezellig * '' . 
  strictly it means tasty , but we use it for lots of enjoyable things .

  the swiss do , kind of , he 's called schmutzi . 
  ( swiss german for roetveegpiet ), 
  the swiss alps are very accessible by public transport : trains and buses .

  i lived in switzerland without a car for years . 
  speed is the same , i sometimes look up words when writing in english .

  [ poffertjes are nice too ] ( https://blog.kamernet.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/apr_21_maa_hapje-poffertjes-730x450.jpg ) but might be harder to find in summer . 
  beautiful ships , i love traditional ship types . 
  have n't done so for a while , apart from a day trip with [ this beauty ] ( http://www.sailamsterdam-2015.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rederijker_1.jpg ) recently , [ a tjalk build in 1889 ] ( http://www.muidercompagnie.nl/schepen/tjalkjacht-de-egelantier ) , originally a freighter but rebuild in 1996 for day trips . 
  i 've never lived near the coast or a lake , but sailing is a popular vacation activity here , i went to a summer camp to learn sailing as a kid , as students we would go to friesland for a weekend and rent boats , my kids went sailing in friesland with scouting and with school , my wife ( who did grew up on the coast ) even did a bit of competitive sailing . 
  i never owned a boat myself . 
  the [ polyvalk ] ( https://media.huren.nl/product/5075-xl-verhuur-valk.jpg ) ( polyester falcon ) is a popular rental boat that i 've often sailed on weekends . 
  i learned sailing on the wooden [ 16m2 ] ( http://16m2.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/belterwiede.jpg ) ( the number refers to the total sail area ) , a classic dutch design . 
  sailing on classic ships ( many are on the register as sailing monuments ) is popular here too . 
  as a student , i made a wonderful vacation trip with friends on [ this tjalk from 1884 ] ( http://zietopuzelvenvaren.weebly.com/fotos.html ) which is typical for the traditional flat-bottomed ships that were used for inland and coastal traffic . 
  this ship did make coastal trips all the way to denmark in the past . 
  as you can see , flat-bottomed ships like this can ground itself on tidal flats without any trouble . 
  us is too large for a road trip :-) but we drove around middle california , camping , a couple of times , which was great . 
  and we drove all over hawaii when i lived there . 
  but strict rental rules and costs are a reason why people i know tend to do this when they are a bit older , not fresh out of school/university . 
  some people do a high-school exchange year though . 
  pretty cool . 
  they are military police/gendarmerie . 
  our aremed forces have four branches : army , navy , air force and marechaussee .
