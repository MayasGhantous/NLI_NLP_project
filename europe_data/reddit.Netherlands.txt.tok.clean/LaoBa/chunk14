  saxons unite , the beacons are lit !, 
  daily . 
  the dutch king suddenly decided in 1848 that an absolute monarchy was n't such a good idea and became a constitutional monarch . 
  fist place with farms in the netherlands was geleen , by the way . 
  i found people in norway and iceland perfectly friendly when we traveled there , never rude . 
  nobody from almere here ? 
  flint tools : 170,000 bc oldest traces of settlement : 5000 bc tumuli : 2500 bc farms : 800 bc name first mentioned : around 1000 ad city rights : 1263 ad, 
  i feel this is a reddit thing only . 
   i think if it 's done it 's done by professionals for population control , not for recreation . 
  no , it 's mostly done by amateurs . 
  there are about 28,000 legal hunters in the netherlands . 
  hunting is hard because you must get a number of licences and have your own hunting area or be invited to someone else 's . 
  my sister in law is a farmer , a hunter pays her and her neighbors a yearly fee to be allowed to hunt on their land . 
   fishing is common in the netherlands 2 million fishers out of a 17 million population . 
  germany : football, 
  yes , i meant that one . 
  yes !, 
   citizens in the us love to identify themselves by there ancestor 's nationality . 
  we tend to do that by province/region . 
  `` the horse of saint nicholas '' . 
  a nice kids movie . 
  saint nicholas is n't celebrated in the us . 
  blackface in movies is not something hollywood will risk these days . 
  i would love to see how a us audience would react to the lyrics of walter moers `` anti-country song '' from das kleine arschloch . 
  you 're welcome to come over . 
  we have a world class university of life sciences and agriculture which is the main reason for the diversity . 
  may i be excused ? 
  in 1975 a train was kept hostage for 12 days : three hostages killed before terrorists surrender . 
  highest number of victims for a terrorist action in the netherlands . 
  1977 train and school hostage situation : two hostages and six terrorist killed when the train is stormed by marine commando 's . 
  highest total number of people killed during a terrorist action in the netherlands . 
  we have also had people killed by the ira , the raf , the japanese red army , the nkvd and by a radical muslim . 
  learning perfect german is hard for dutch people . 
  learning to understand german is n't really that hard , at least , i could understand 80 % of die maus , trickfilmzeit mit adelheit and klimbim on television without german lessons as a dutch kid . 
   is it easier to learn for us ? 
  i 'm talking masters/phd or working/falling in love here . 
  erasmus students ( apart from the german ones ) rarely learn dutch . 
  well , my town is n't very large ( 37,000 inhabitants ) but people with 152 nationalities live here !, 
   i manicure the lawn at stonehenge . 
  well , i did help clear vegetation tumuli in the nearby woods . 
  they date from the neolithic and bronze age . 
  also the [ teutonic knights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bailiwick_of_utrecht ) are still there in [ their old 1348 headquarters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duitse_huis ) . 
  terezin is also a very well preserved fortress town . 
  the cheese situation in the us is far from optimal too . 
  i like it when people try to learn dutch , i live in a town with many international students and many of those who stay longer learn dutch . 
  [ the swiss contender ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ywtqlm1ko8 ), 
  strongly encouraged . 
  depending on the level , you either get two or one modern language in addition to english , usually german and french although a few school offer spanish or russian . 
  german and french are pretty handy on vacation . 
  yes , i do . 
  both at home and in other people 's houses , unless asked ( which is rare ) to take them off . 
  i wear slippers but the rest of my family goes barefoot or wears socks at home . 
  i do n't wear clogs indoors though !,

  according to their statutes , the government should help evangelize and keep false religions out . 
  they believe in the `` freedom of conscience '' which was also the law of the dutch republic , and meant that no-one could be forced to believe in a specific religion , or punished for witnessing their religious views . 
  but not freedom of religious expression . 
  according to them , people with the `` wrong '' religion should not openly show their religious in public space , no visible mosques or catholic churches , etc , this is because they still state all policies of their party should comply with the [ three forms of unity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_forms_of_unity ) from 1619 , * without any conditions * . 
  wales , i love dragons !, 
  dutch nouns are gendered or neutral and articles are different based on this , also adjective endings but only with the indefinite article . 
  this trips any long-time immigrants . 
   due to the dutch elections i have heard they also have one we have three in the netherlands : cda ( christian democrats ) , cu ( christian union ) , sgp ( calvinist party )  are these parties actually solely christians focusing on christian issues and ideas ? 
  cda is a mainstream party that often has been in government and is not linked to a specific church . 
  they are more or less compassionate conservatives . 
  although they were not in favor of homosexual marriage , euthanasia or abortion they are not actively working to overturn the present practice . 
  they believe in freedom of religion and separation of church and state . 
  cu is a small protestant party that is very much for taking in refugees , development aid , and preserving the environment , usually voting with left-wing parties on this . 
  they have been part of a government coalition . 
  brotherly love and solidarity is important for them , based on the bible . 
  forbidding cursing , not working on sunday , women working at home and no nudity in the media are also things they are in favor for . 
  they are also against homosexuality , euthanasia or abortion . 
  they believe in freedom of religion and separation of church and state . 
  sgp is a small protestant party . 
  these guys ( they do n't believe women should be in politics ) are hardcore , as they take the bible as a touchstone for everything they do n't believe in separation of church and state , they have a theocracy as official aim . 
  most of the things they want are extremely conservative , they are against freedom of religion and public display of non-protestant religions , voting for women , immigration , homosexuality , the internet ( they have a website now but it is closed on sunday ) . 
  they are very much a rural party and their voters are all members of the dutch reformed church . 
  i sense a certain similarity in your flags . 
  you can easily find places like [ this ] ( http://www.greenbusinessclub.nl/uploads/images/het%20groene%20hart%2010.jpg ) within 30 kilometer of the center of amsterdam , rotterdam or the hague . 
  vietnamese stalls selling spring rolls are very common though . 
  sometimes movies get made with regional dialects or in frisian which get subtitles . 
  the movie gl\u00fcck auf in limburg dialect is a recent example . 
  this debate was about the deductible on health insurance , i think . 
  [ it happens ] ( https://images2.persgroep.net/rcs/nn7vgtt291maplc4arbn2yckg5k/diocontent/63647585/_crop/0/92/899/508/_fitwidth/763?appid=e9b4e2a1869038ffcaf318a6d1463b0b ) . 
  debate in an almost empty 2e kamer/dutch parliament . 
   is it mostly urban and then countryside ? 
  in the netherlands , yes . 
  we do n't have large suburban areas . 
   do you visit often ? 
  yes , i live in a university town of 35,000 inhabitants and there are many nice area 's for walking and cycling just outside town . 
  the dutch countryside is very accessible , there are lots of roads , cycling and walking paths , and there are few large private areas where you have no access . 
   are the people dramatically different ? 
  yes , there is certainly a big difference between the larger cities and small villages , even though the netherlands is so small that you are never really far away from a city . 
  my wife grew up in a farming village with a 2-room school where everyone knew each other . 
   are rural areas widespread in your country ? 
  yes .
