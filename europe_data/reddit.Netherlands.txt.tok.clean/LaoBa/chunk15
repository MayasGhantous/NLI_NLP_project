  the netherlands is densely populated but has little sprawl so there are still many rural areas . 
  agriculture is still important for the economy ( money wise , the netherlands is the second largest agricultural exporter worldwide , and 80 % of that is produced in the netherlands ), 
  in the netherlands : strict zoning is absolutely the main reason . 
  lost of land is dedicated agricultural land and is n't sold for suburbs . 
  the remaining land is pretty expensive , so us style suburbs/sprawl is rare . 
  [ the heart of the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groene_hart ) has been deliberately kept as open space . 
  the population density of dutch cities is much higher that that of us cities . 
  on the other hand , out inner cities have mostly been very livable so there has n't been a `` flight to the suburbs '' like in the us , inner cities are mostly prime locations here . 
  from my province : [ along the big rivers ] ( https://klaskedejong.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/streekpad-nijmegen-10908241.jpg ) [ gelders valley ] ( http://img04.deviantart.net/4e66/i/2015/029/5/6/binnenveld_wageningen_by_jeroenbrugman-d8fuf96.jpg ) [ in the dutch mountains ] ( http://www.erfgoedlogies.nl/uploads/asset/file/6567/lightbox_07b3aa32-7677-4c4a-9055-517add24e071.jpg ) [ village with church and windmill ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/44257344.jpg ),

  oldtimers ( 40 + ) like this vehicle are exempt . 
  just why ? 
  well i do n't see [ this happening in other countries ] ( https://images3.persgroep.net/rcs/hiis5_rvh-sifqp3eacbvqzmhma/diocontent/62066931/_crop/0/0/1580/1723/_fitwidth/694/?appid=21791a8992982cd8da851550a453bd7f&amp;quality=0.9 ), 
  false : * we do n't smoke a lot of weed , it may be decriminalized but people smoking a lot of weed are certainly seen as losers here . 
  * prostitution may be legal but is still a taboo , both working as a prostitute or visiting one . 
  * we 're neither going to be an islamic republic or have a president wilders . 
  * wooden shoes are still worn but mostly by farmers or for gardening . 
  true : * we are tall . 
  * we all drive bicycles . 
  * we have 1170 historic windmills , mostly in working order . 
  visit one of you ever come to the netherlands !, 
  * we eat a lot of cheese . 
   do n't let anyone tell you that the scottish are mean , because they are not !, 
  well compared to us dutch they are n't . 
  but yeah , scottish people are very friendly .

  i know ( more or less ) the german bundesl\u00e4nder , the swiss cantons and the dutch and belgian provinces . 
  also in the limburgs dialects . 
  we even have [ this stuff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s_mgdkqqsu ) in the netherlands !, 
  ( shudder ), 
  i like both dutch and its dialects !, 
  [ this is the dialect form my home area ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyufsx9wpeq ) [ and this from where my family in law lives ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72fgzd174yq ) i try to speak dutch with foreigners who can understand it or speak it . 
  a traditional dutch brown caf\u00e9 is not really the place to work with a laptop and headphones . 
  more modern places , yes . 
  [ my local brown cafe ] ( http://proefwageningen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/onder-de-linden.jpg ) is a nice mixture of modern ( they have home-brew beer and spirits , electricity for e-bikes ) and traditional ( interior style , neighborhood bar ) . 
  if you travel around in a van it 's not backpacking :-) i would ask this on / r/travel, 
  most of the country ( all provinces ) , including some of the islands and caribbean parts of the kingdom !, 
  i have yet to visit leeuwarden though . 
  we have mandatory private insurance here in the netherlands . 
  you are free to choose your own insurer , they have to accept anyone , they have to reimburse most medical care ( what exactly is set by the government ) . 
  low income people get subsidies to pay for their insurance , which is about 100 euro 's per person per month , kids are free , with a 385 euro yearly deductible for hospital care . 
  so it 's not entirely private in that you ca n't offer an insurance policy that covers less than the state mandated minimum . 
   insist the waits to get into a doctor are awful . 
  not really , there were problems in around 2000 with that but at the moment i hear few complaints . 
  nothing special , my wife 's uncle and aunt are first cousins . 
  there is a 19th century cousin marriage in my own family tree . 
  it is n't common , though .

   or do people generally not give a crap so long as you are n't obnoxious about it ? 
  this is the default , of course it depends a bit on how far out of the mainstream your opinions are . 
  * fired : firing people in the netherlands is n't easy , so firing someone for their personal views could usually be successfully contested in court . 
  discrimination based on religion or political views is not allowed . 
  a christian or muslim school ca n't refuse someone applying for a job just because they 're atheist . 
  you can be fired for things you do at your job , for example evangelizing at work . 
  an atheist working at a religious school could be fired for teaching children `` god does n't exist '' . 
  note that you can refuse certain work ( conscious objection ) without being automatically fired , your employer must try to accommodate you , only if this is n't possible this is a valid reason to fire someone . 
  * loose friends : it can happen , but i do n't often hear about people loosing their friends over political disputes . 
  * be ostracized . 
  if you try to start [ a political party to make sex between 12 year olds and adults fully legal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_for_neighbourly_love,_freedom,_and_diversity ) , then yes . 
  a couple of cross-border trips per year are normal for me , and it is great i do n't have to get foreign currency each time . 
  where i grew up it was 15 minutes to germany and 15 minutes to belgium !, 
  i love british cider . 
  the stuff sold in the supermarkets ( mostly strongbow ) is over priced . 
  it is very much a niche product here . 
  if you go [ full titles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/style_of_the_dutch_sovereign ) , i love our king is count of katzenelnbogen which is german for cats elbows .

  we used to be really good at football/soccer , but the last five years have been very disappointing . 
  this is what we call a `` brown caf\u00e9 '' in the netherlands , a traditional neighborhood place . 
  by the way , anyone interested in shooting a gun in the netherlands can also visit a [ shooting range ] ( http://www.schietbaandewildenberg.nl/en/home ) if they want and have a go at it . 
  also ajax and feyenoord * are * from holland , though psv is from brabant . 
  many pupils with a vmbo-diploma attend mbo . 
  the mbo lasts one to four years , depending of the level . 
  there are 4 levels offered to student . 
  : * mbo level 1 : assistant training . 
  it lasts 1 year maximum . 
  it is focused on simple executive tasks . 
  if the student graduates , he/she can apply to mbo level 2 . 
  * mbo level 2 : basic vocational education . 
  the programme lasts 2 to 3 years and is focused on supervised tasks . 
  * mbo level 3 : the programme lasts 3 to 4 years . 
  students are taught to achieve their tasks independently . 
  * mbo level 4 : middle management vet . 
  it lasts 3 to 4 years and prepares for jobs with higher responsibility . 
  it also opens the gates to higher education . 
  at all levels , mbo offers 2 possible pathways : a school-based education , where training within a company takes between 20 and 59 % of the curriculum , or an apprenticeship education , where this training represents more than 60 % of the study time . 
  both paths lead to the same certification . 
  students in mbo are mostly between 16 and 35 . 
  students of the `` apprenticeship '' path are overall older ( 25 + ) . 
  after mbo ( 4 years ) , pupils can enroll in hbo or enter the job market . 
  a multitude of mbo studies is typically offered at a regionaal opleidingen centrum ( roc ; literally , `` regional education center '' ) . 
  most rocs are concentrated on one or several locations in larger cities . 
  exceptions include schools offering specialized mbo studies such as agriculture , and schools adapted to pupils with a learning disability that require training in small groups or at an individual level, 
  no , nutella is n't dutch or something . 
  also , [ cheese stores for tourists only in amsterdam ] ( https://goldenagecheesestore.com/ ) . 
  okay they sell dutch cheese , but one kind only . 
  while old amsterdam tastes fine , it is mass produced and not that interesting . 
  [ this is one of the cheese sellers at my local market , far away from amsterdam ] ( http://www.veendaler.nl/markt/85/hoevelaken%20veendaler%20henk.jpg ) , they have lots of dutch and foreign cheeses , you can taste everything you want . 
  difficult question .
