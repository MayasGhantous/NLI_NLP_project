  ** willem de zwijger ** ( william the silent ) father of the dutch nation . 
  he was actually an eloquent man but refused to commit himself in the political and theological disputes of the time ( until he chose to lead the dutch revolt ) . 
  his father was william the rich ( who was indeed rich , william the silent also married a rich wife and inherited the princedom of orange from his childless uncle ) ** frederik hendrik de stedendwinger ** ( frederick henry the city conqueror ) on behalf of his many successful sieges in the southern netherlands . 
  ** lodewijk napolean , konijn van holland ** ( louis napoleon , the dutch rabbit ) louis was placed on the dutch throne by his brother . 
  his pronunciation of `` koning '' ( king ) sounded more like `` konijn '' ( rabbit ) . 
  at first people saw him as a puppet of his brother , but he genuinely tried to be a good king , promote dutch interests and took personal command to help victims during several disasters . 
  by the time his brother made him abdicate , the dutch had grown rather fond of him . 
  beatrix was nicknamed `` the smiling princess '' when she was young . 
  all european countries signed the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees ( 1951 ) . 
  in addition , the european convention on human rights ( 1953 ) which all [ council of europe member states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_states_of_the_council_of_europe ) have signed governs the rights of refugees . 
   intouchables that one was fun .

  * un long dimanche de fian\u00e7ailles * is one of my favorite movies , really epic , mixing humor , drama , mystery and romance . 
  and this dutch classic [ klein orkest : over de muur ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svghh346rik ), 
  and that drugs are n't legal . 
  no-one . 
  act normal , that 's enough . 
  [ mine looks like it 's still 1950 inside ! ] ( http://proefwageningen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/onder-de-linden.jpg ) . 
  it looks like this from [ outside ] ( http://onderdelindenwageningen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mainfotoodl-slider.jpg ) . 
  it 's a former country place that is now in a build-up area . 
  they have their own little brewery and still . 
  homemade trifle !, 
  worked well in ww1 , despite some grumbling by the allies . 
  so we decided that to keep neutral in ww2 too . 
  apart from 1672 , we had never been invaded by germany since the middle ages , so we hoped it would work again . 
  but ...  do you wish you were more or less involved ? 
  definitely less involved in ww2 . 
  it would have saved a lot of jewish lives . 
  and other dutch and mabye indonesian lives , although i think japan would have occupied indonesia anyway , even if we were n't at war with germany . 
  in other countries it is meat stew instead of soup . 
  it is now !, 
  i know only one portuguese immigrant , she 's a nice woman who did her phd in the netherlands and is now married to a dutchman . 
  i did . 
  germans . 
  i remember them , very annoying , also you have to close off a lot of roads to make them effective . 
   ditch speaking parts of belgium . 
  hey , do n't put yourself down like that !, 
  i think it should be 16 again , most people are still at home at that age and parents can keep an eye on them , also binge-drinking among youth ( also under 16 ) has n't really gone down since they raised the minimum age . 
  water , sometimes wine ( with french , swiss or italian food ) or beer ( with chinese or indonesian food ) . 
  henderson and i.j. 
  ebbelink-bosch , although this is n't specifically about dutch cuisine only . 
  in english , you could try * recipes from my dutch kitchen : explore the unique and delicious cuisine of the netherlands in over 80 classic dishes * by janny de moor . 
  for people interested in traditional dutch cooking i can recommend the excellent website [ the dutch table ] ( http://www.thedutchtable.com/ ) by nicole holten , which features many dutch classics . 
  married to a farmer 's daughter . 
  my sister in law is still a farmer . 
  so this is about the farm in the north of the netherlands where my wife grew up . 
   is it a family farm ? 
  yes , her father 's generation are all farmers and a number of her cousins still are . 
   for how many generations ? 
  at least 5 , but farmers would also move around because of better opportunities or bankruptcy . 
   does your farm have employees or is it strictly a family affair ? 
  they used to have an employee until the early 1970 's . 
  before the 2nd world war , having a couple of employees was common and there were also a lot of landless farm workers who would be hired at will . 
  since then it is mostly family , with family members having their own farms but helping each other out . 
   what kind of crops do you grow ? 
  the main crop has always been wheat , with vegetables and green manures in addition , and energy crops like miscanthus and switchgrass . 
   if your parents were farmers , did they discourage or encourage you to follow in their footsteps ? 
  my sister in law helped her father from a young age and has taken over part of the farm . 
  my wife was never interested , she did study agricultural sciences though . 
  her parents were neither encouraging or discouraging for their daughters to become farmers . 
   did you receive any post-secondary education related to agriculture ? 
  ( college or university level classes ? ), 
  my father in law only attended secondary agrarian education , he 's more of a hands-on guy . 
  my sister in law has a phd in agricultural meteorology and has worked as a crop researcher and weather woman in addition to running a farm . 
   equipment my sister in law has two tractors , as well as a bunch of towed equipment . 
  combines are rented . 
  she has to be frugal so she uses everything as long as it is economic . 
  i think she still has the first post-war tractor of her father too . 
   anyone work in related fields ? 
  my wife has worked for the dutch crop protection service and now works for a animal feeds safety organization . 
  both she and i have phd 's in agricultural science . 
  [ remeker ] ( http://www.remeker.nl/?lang=en ), 
   we never were an industrial powerhouse switzerland was early industrialized with a lot of machine and textile industry . 
  was in jotunheimen and hardangervidda a long time ago , can highly recommend it . 
  note : while high german is the official language , and used for newspapers , in german speaking cantons people actually speak swiss german with each other which is very different . 
  compare the weather forecast in [ german ] ( https://youtu.be/fe8ywhiy5oi?t=17 ) to the weather forecast in [ swiss-german ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3-ufpcubse ) . 
  i 'm in the same province , my town only gets * very old * military tourists , mostly from canada . 
  my small town has people from 167 nationalities but they are n't tourists !, 
  most tourists go a bit op north where you can combine cycling in the woods with enjoying [ modern art ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3df8tlnn94a ) ( yes , those are van gogh 's ), 
  living in a terraced house , i can hear them if their kids are loud or their dog is barking , but it 's never really a problem . 
  in limburg it 's serious business with an extensive [ program ] ( http://www.vastelaovendzitterd.nl/pregram.html ) , which includes opening the carnival season on 11/11 , parties , election of the princes , parades for the kids and for adults , `` dansmariekes '' and brassbands , and more local traditions . 
  this is a conscious decision to keep the supermarkets close to where people live so they can be reached by bike . 
  usually zoning wo n't allow for superstores . 
  everyone learns it by school and lots of subtitles english language media . 
  or reading english ( used to be physical books , now mainly internet/gaming ) . 
  private tutoring is almost unknown . 
  europe did n't become secular and scientific by * banning * religion . 
  pretty nice , at least the ones i lived in . 
  always a private room , some have their own kitchens and bathrooms , others have shared facilities . 
  cheap health insurance and subsidized student housing ( but there are waiting lists ) . 
  win . 
   pronounce it in english well , somewhat english . 
  many of the smaller canal cities ( leiden , haarlem , dordrecht , gouda , delft , amersfoort ) are really pretty . 
  also , efteling is one of the best amusement parks in europe . 
  as a person : * like many countries , we have a maiden , [ the dutch maiden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_maiden ) . 
  she exists since the independence of the netherlands , like in this [ painting from 1681 } ( http://hubert-herald.nl/rijkswapen_bestanden/image020.jpg ) . 
  since the french revolution and the batavian republic , she gets more attributes from pallas athena . 
  she was most popular in the 19th century .
