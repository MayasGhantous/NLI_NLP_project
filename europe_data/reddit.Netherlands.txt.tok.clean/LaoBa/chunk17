  [ the dutch maiden announcing the birth of princess wilhelmina at the registrar ] ( http://www.rhc-eindhoven.nl/upload/image/2011-week18klein.jpg ) she is rarely seen in political cartoons these days . 
  * in foreign cartoons , a man or a woman in volendam costume , like these [ german ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-srvpkuhwe80/v8oz1_vi2ri/aaaaaaaajfg/jssdeyyv0x8_wpctsdrgti-yhevrzkezwclcb/s1600/lustige%2bblatter%2b-%2bband%2b3%2b-%2bdutch%2bborder%2b001.jpg ) and [ british ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000ewvt06iak8g/s/900/720/ww1-great-war-cartoons-punch-magazine-raven-hill-1917-03-07-151.jpg ) cartoons .

  halloween is getting more popular in the netherlands which is not a dutch holiday . 
  pubs may stage their own oktoberfest . 
   usually technically not the university but a separate organization that provides services to students . 
  depending on the city there are long waiting lists for these rooms as they tend to be good value for money . 
  i 'm a software engineer worked in dutch companies with colleagues that spoke no dutch : from sweden , indonesia , romania , india , etc. 
  both companies were in amsterdam . 
  however , i also know plenty of companies who wo n't hire software engineers who do n't understand dutch . 
  the trend is in-sourcing at the moment , so large teams of indians on the work-floor are getting rarer . 
  my own company is looking for software engineers right now but they have dutch as a requirement . 
  you can also start your own one-man company in the netherlands ( as an american ) through the daft treaty and work as a contractor . 
  in the netherlands it 's pretty casual , especially during your masters . 
  getting invited at home by your professor is not uncommon . 
  underground tour in tabor was great . 
  the different underground systems of maastricht ( old quarries and old defense systems ) are really worth a visit . 
  nearby valkenburg has some interesting underground stuff too ( a imitation coal mine , and two other artificial caves . ), 
  and just over the border in belgium from maastricht is a [ gigantic underground fortress from the 1930 's ] ( http://www.fort-eben-emael.be/en/ ) and more quarries . 
  [ i use this one every day ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/van_hool_agg300#/media/file:qbuzz_u-ov_4203_utrecht_centraal.jpg ) . 
  it 's 25 meter long . 
  it 's an [ van hool newagg 300 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/van_hool_agg300 ) they can carry 180/190 people . 
  there have been no big scandals with false reporting by the nos as far as i know . 
  nrc handelsblad is the newspaper of record with an excellent separation between news and opinion pieces , they still maintain a serious amount of journalists and foreign correspondents . 
  not really interested in watching it . 
   do they still feel resentment towards former enemies ? 
  no , none of my parents nor my parents in law have ever shown resentment against the germans or the japanese , even though my dad was in a japanese internment camp and both of his parents died in japanese captivity . 
  i have never heard my dad say anything against the japanese as a people , he as a great admirer of japanese artwork . 
  my mother was a child/young teen during the war but never had any direct interaction with the germans , although her brother had to do forced labour in germany . 
  but nobody of my mothers or in-laws family died as a result of the german occupation , which helps of course . 
   do they think things are going in the right direction ? 
  in general , yes . 
  of course , they do n't think everything is great but i never heard them say everything was better in the past or everything is going to hell now . 
  [ wooden shoes ] ( https://www.dehollandseklompenwinkel.nl/en/sanded-wooden-shoes.html ), 
  our [ east-netherland ] ( http://www.bevrijdingsmuseum.nl/bevrijdingsmuseum/upload/534landjepik.jpg ) territories seem to be a bit unruly today . 
  a long time ago . 
  there are about 200,000 legal privately owned guns in the netherlands . 
  i 'm dutch and i know a few people who own guns ( hunters and hobby-shooters ) , even though i do n't share these hobbies . 
  i am from wageningen , gelderland , the netherlands and europe . 
  no , for men there is also a big stigma to report rape or abuse . 
  drinking beer or wine in the railways is allowed ( not on king 's day ) . 
  no , because you ca n't openly carry them . 
  gun buyers are a small market in the netherlands so sending out brochures does n't make sense . 
  you can buy gun magazines with advertisement in any bookstore with a good selection of magazines . 
  travel 200 miles in a strait line and you 're not in the netehrlands anymore . 
  chocolate-covered stroopwafels . 
  come on , never been in tavel ? 
   brussel is the top 10 most dangerous city in europe top ten dangerous city of very safe cities is still very safe . 
   have i been mislead by media ? 
  the problem about modern day media is `` if it bleeds , it leads '' . 
  and then , people use the news to promote their views and agenda . 
  if someone told you `` i 'm terrified to come to the us as a black person because the police shoots black people all the time without reasons in the us . '', 
  you 'd probably not take that person very serious . 
  we read about black lives matter here in europe and you can of course read such news as `` black lives do n't matter in the us . '', 
  that there are legitimate problems does n't mean that you should exaggerate the situation . 
  i think it is good that you pose this question if you are genuinely concerned , even though it sounds strange to us . 
  in general , life is very safe here , yes some cities have bad neighborhoods but not as bad as bad us neighborhoods . 
  if you come here as a student , ask your fellow students if there are places to avoid and use some common sense if you are afraid of your safety , but there is no reason to be terrified at all . 
  us has a murder rate of 3.9 per 100,000 , belgium 1.8 per 100,000 . 
  and belgium is relatively high for europe ( and no , this has nothing to do with the recent refugees , it has been higher for a long time ) , germany has 0.9 and the netherlands has 0.7 for example . 
  as i said , i know nothing about the actual situation in slovenia and can not read local media , so i have no idea , but all these things happen to some extend in the netherlands . 
   how exactly am i more privileged over my black neighbor ( if i had one ) ? 
  less likely to be stopped by the police ? 
  less likely to be accused of crimes ? 
  less likely to be refused jobs or housing ? 
  higher expectations in school ? 
  all may be possible in your country ( i have no idea about the actual situation in slovenia ) , and a thing you wo n't notice if you are n't black yourself . 
  4.5 % of the population is vegetarian , but another 14 % eats meat only a few days every week . 
  doing an [ intertidal tour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mudflat_hiking ) in the north is one of the few real wilderness experiences in the netherlands . 
  carnaval ( in brabant ) / vastelaovend ( in limburg ) in the south is our mardi gras celebration and is a great experience if you like parades , dressed-up people , cheesy music and alcohol . 
  it 's in february or early march . 
  i love that we still say `` verkeerd verbonden `` in the netherlands when we mean `` ik heb een verkeerd nummer gedraaid `` and also that we sometimes still say `` gedraaid '' for phone numbers . 
  this is a real dutch word that is used all the time `` arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering '' . 
  we 're just as cool as the germans , just underappreciated :-(, 
  leedvermaak ( `` suffering-entertainment '' ) in dutch means exactly the same . 
  by metric weight , of course . 
  i do own a set of us measuring cups for us recipes , though . 
   the evangelische omroep ( evangelic association ) they also remove references to evolution for nature series like `` planet earth '', 
  [ here you can listen to some of them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhmcvjmzs-i ), 
  dutch miners tended to vote kvp ( catholic peoples party ) , but as the last mine closed in 1974 there are n't many of them left . 
  he would have to change our constitution , which guarantees ( article 6 ) freedom of religion and the right to hold religious services in private . 
  he would need a 2/3 majority in both houses to change the constitution . 
  anyway , [ he has retracted banning the koran ] ( http://www.nu.nl/politiek/4460955/wilders-nuanceert-koranverbod.html ) . 
   `` of course , we 're not going to check people 's homes '' so more hollow theoretic . 
  [ o mundo ] ( http://www.restaurantomundo.nl/home/ ) has a michelin star , i 've eaten there twice and it was excellent . 
  [ het gesprek ] ( http://www.hetgesprek.com/ ) has never disappointed me yet and is much more affordable . 
  i 'm 50 , and there always was some terrorism , this does n't feel particularly alarming . 
  police and security services are working on it , as they should . 
  [ batavus padova ] ( http://www.dikkenbergtweewielers.nl/mme/upload/bicyclepic_public_l_297025.jpg ) , male version though . 
  not to be confused with the electric batavus padova they sell now . 
  gazelle or batavus are the only real options here !, 
  i totally love the term idiotikon , it sounds like a small village in the z\u00fcrcher oberland . 
  i 'm glad that abortion is legal and widely available here . 
  my hairdresser is kurdish , nice guy married to a dutch woman . 
  kurds are mainly seen as okay people here . 
  bicycles , bicycle infrastructure and respect for cyclists . 
  the world would be cleaner and healthier . 
  nobody knows what it is . 
  nobody watches american football here .
