   but how would a guy listening to music and mumbling `` death to america '' on mass transit be handled in your city and country ? 
  nobody would care in the least . 
   even though it 's a slightly different song til, 
  [ walzer f\u00fcr niemand - sophie hunger ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acs9ngtq6e4 ) is awesome . 
  [ s'liechtli - christine lauterburg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rxykzd-9kw ) is a personal favorite with beautiful yodeling . 
  bonus : [ mooie dag by bl\u00f8f and heather nova ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bhap0ti1jm ), 
  this is the [ maurits march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmhbxkrraqc ) of my former local coal mine in the netherlands . 
  [ at 1:21 the steigerlied comes by ] ( https://youtu.be/dmhbxkrraqc?t=81 ) , also note the text is in german . 
  bronsgroen eikenhout , [ limburg 's anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cw5ghhidoq ) is pretty well known and a great source of pride , also a remainder from what [ once was one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx_i2i1kyo0 ) ( belgian limburg has the same anthem ) . 
  and having groningen inlaws i can tell you people there really know their [ anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu49bytk5sk ) too . 
  by now i know the text pretty well . 
  [ this gives you some idea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgfbycwsesg ) . 
  [ and this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93ptg8wvvs ), 
  there were all kinds of [ plans ] ( http://horl.yolasite.com/resources/annexatie.jpeg ) and [ propaganda ] ( http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=urn:gvn:nago02:amh-ms0060405&amp;size=large ) , yeah . 
  glad it did n't happen , although our annexation of kleve seems to be going well . 
  do n't forget elten + selfkant 1963 !, 
  and i 've been in many other countries including other north african and asian countries . 
  it just overwhelmed me the first few days ( we were backpacking on our own ) that no-one seemed to leave you alone in public . 
  however , after a few days i became more used to it , we found nicer places and experienced the extreme hospitality of the moroccans and it turned into an awesome vacation . 
  being invited to join a wedding party in a nomad camp in the high atlas was certainly a highlight !, 
  * major tax haven . 
  * produces a lot of illegal drugs for export . 
  * not nearly as green as they should be . 
  * burns cows for energy . 
  * failed to prevent srebrenica massacre . 
  in the netherlands ? 
  please continue to do so . 
  the marseillaise is super metal . 
  shortest golden age ever !, 
  yes , we have about 8000 doopsgezinden , the mennonite church of the netherlands . 
  but they are very far removed from the public image of the american amish and mennonites !, 
  menno simons , the founder of the mennonites , was dutch and his pacifistic church became popular after the defeat of the militant anabaptists in munster . 
  during the dutch golden age , mennonism was tolerated by the government but mennonites were banned from many official functions and guild membership and their churches , like the others outside the protestant mainstream , were not allowed to be in public view . 
  their pacifism also brought them into conflict with the authorities , but in many dutch towns this was solved by having them man/pay for the municipal fire brigades . 
  although some emigrated , for example to russia , for a long time about a quarter of the population of the provinces north-holland and friesland were mennonites . 
  because of their exclusion from the guilds , some became involved with the money trade and and very rich . 
  they were very interested in philosophy and the ideas of the french revolution . 
  around that time they changed their name from mennonites to doopsgezinden ( baptist-minded ) and became a very progressive church , which they have remained to this day . 
  most of the more orthodox members left for other churches in the 19th century . 
  they were the first church in the netherlands to accept women in the priesthood in 1905 . 
  in 1911 , anne zernike became the first woman minister in the country . 
  they were also the first the first to accept and perform same-sex marriage in the service . 
  they are members of the mennonite world conference . 
   the eu is just letting it happen the eu launched sanctions that had a major impact on the russian economy . 
  they 're pretty marginal , they have n't had any seats in parliament yet , and they are not very likely to get one this year . 
  their chief candidate just gave an ama on / r/thenetherlands, 
  definitely ask this on / r/zurich . 
  there are many nice places to eat in z\u00fcrich but my personal knowledge is sadly years out of date . 
  note that eating out in z\u00fcrich is pretty expensive . 
  wilders is not against the welfare state . 
  well , he was when he was still part of the vvd , but his electorate now is definitely not interested in lower aow , lower disability and unemployment benefits , and stuff like that . 
  wilders usual argumentation these days is `` there is enough money for benefits for * real * dutch people but the elite is spending it all on brussels and foreigners . '', 
  dutch has `` u '' ( formal ) and `` je '' ( informal ) , plural `` u '' ( formal ) and `` jullie '' informal . 
  the use of the formal form has greatly diminished over the last 60 years but it is still in daily use . 
   how do shopkeepers call customers ? 
  they will usually use the formal version . 
   how did your teachers call you ? 
  always informal , while teachers are usually addressed with the formal form . 
   is using the formal address with your parents normal or does it sound ridiculous ? 
  extremely rare these days , we did a poll in our class in 1980 and only one girl addressed her parents using the formal address . 
   how do you call your boss ? 
  in all places where i have worked , with the informal address . 
   are there maybe more than two levels of politeness ? 
  no  do you sometimes make weird sentences to avoid using the second person because you 're not sure how you are supposed to talk to someone ? 
  not really . 
  case in point , job interviews . 
  in your letter , you will always use the formal address , but once you meet the interviewer , if he of she will introduce themselves by their first names , it is usually fine to use the informal form . 
  fun that so many people forget that amsterdam is the 4th busiest port of europe . 
  no , we can spend that money maintaining the 1000 's of castles we already have . 
  i 'd say the [ 1953 north sea flood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_sea_flood_of_1953 ) , 1836 people drowned and 9 % of the countries agricultural land flooded . 
  the [ saint elizabeth 's flood of 1421 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._elizabeth%27s_flood_\\ ( 1421 \\ ) ) caused between 2,000 and 10,000 casualties . 
  french : [ coeur de pirate - place de la republique ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puwtoowq4bu ) swiss-german : [ christine lauterburg - s liechtli ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rxykzd-9kw ) german : [ sophie hunger - walzer f\u00fcr niemand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oiyggdahky ) frisian : [ twarres - w\u00ear bisto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akzorodwtyc ) limburgs : [ janse bagge bend - sollicitere ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvjdv-w1bfc ), 
  palinka is good . 
  yes , definitely . 
  yes , i think providing healthcare to its citizens is should be one of the first priorities of any government . 
  i lived in honolulu for a while and cycling there was pretty much okay , not many cycle lanes but people were relaxed drivers and there were lots of quiet backstreets . 
  bull runs are a thing in many towns in southern france too , smaller and a bit safer than pamplona though . 
  we do n't have any famous piece of classical music except for our national [ anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbfe8tpzfc4 ) ( which is indeed pretty old ), 
  we also have the brunstad christian church , a fairly conservative christian sect . 
  i had a colleague who was a member , he was a great guy . 
   the pilgrims at plymouth colony note that the pilgrims lived in the netherlands before they went to america . 
  the plot thickens . 
  of course !, 
  limburg does n't have much woods , unfortunately . 
   their flag is a copycat of the dutch one they were part of the netherlands but due to salic law they split off when wilhelmina became the queen . 
  pity , it would have been cool to have a nice wooded part of the netherlands down south . 
  the dutch of the canadian one ? 
  dutch : bruine bonen met spek en stroop canadian : baked beans with maple syrup, 
  more likely because a lot of dutch people emigrated to canada after ww2 . 
  i though the netherlands was the only place to eat beans with syrup , turns out the canadians do it too . 
   it 's prohibited this depends on the municipality . 
  it 's not prosecuted where i live . 
  drinking alcohol is also allowed on the train ( ns , arriva prohibits it ), 
  say ice hockey when you mean ice hockey . 
  the town where i grew up has a proud ice hockey team , although not as proud as it once was . 
  now called the limburg eaters , which name makes no sense whatsoever , they used to be the glorious geleen smoke eaters , the name made sense because geleen was a town of coal mines and smokestacks , if you see [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re1ofz99klk ) you 'll understand . 
  compensation for the complete abolition of nobility . 
  nope , dutch flag has cmyk 0.90.100.10 ( red ) 0.0.0.0 ( white ) 100.80.10.50 ( blue ) while french flag has 0.90.86.0 ( red ) 0.0.0.0 ( white ) 100.70.0.5 ( blue ) . 
  dutch flag has horizontal bars because you can keep using it until only a small strip is left through wear and tear , while the spendthrift french have a flag that needs to be thrown away when 1/3 is missing . 
  note that may has not given any cmyk codes yet for her red , white and blue brexit .
