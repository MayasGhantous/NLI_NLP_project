  does she mean 0.91.76.6 , 0.0.0.0 , 100.72.0.18.5 ? 
  by the way i just learned today that you can hang your union jack upside down . 
  1.3 million dutch go to france each year . 
  we like france a lot . 
  more netherlands pride : * [ frisian horse ] ( http://amz02.plzcdn.com/5a972478cdf155b2b096b0d80e9ed625.jpg ) * [ dutch draft horse ] ( http://www.bracom.nl/wp-content/uploads/5x7d0476.jpg ) * [ dutch shepherd ] ( http://www.vtbikseland.nl/vtbikseland.nl/images/diverse/langhaar.jpg ) ( longhair ) * [ saarlooswolfshond ] ( http://www.animals-wallpapers.com/animal/dogs-two-sea-cars.jpg ), 
   we should use the same policy here . 
  well , we do use `` amerikaanse toestanden '' in the netherlands when using the us as a bad example . 
  yes , we know the feeling in the netherlands . 
  [ the truth about amsterdam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpsfisxm3w ) [ rick santorum on euthanasia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9nsky722pc ), 
   unlike the western allied soldiers , soviet soldiers on leave off their bases were fairly uncommon . 
  people from thuringen told me that their datsjas were sometimes broken into by russian soldiers form a nearby truppengel\u00e4nde . 
  they said leaving one or two bottles of booze for the soldiers to find tended to limit the damage . 
  i had it as a kid in bremen and it was pretty good . 
  i have n't spoken any syrian refugees either . 
  it 's what we learn in school , and i consider british english european english . 
  the rock of gibraltar = the rock of tarik 's mountain . 
  in dutch , * drukken * means pressing , printing , and also shitting . 
  we use * boulevard * ( wide street ) and * mannequin * ( catwalk model ) in dutch which are french derivations of * bolwerk * ( bulwark , yes english used our word too ) and * manneken * ( little man , puppet ) . 
  * pierewaaien * ( partying , lazing around ) and * mammoet * ( mammoth ) come from russian . 
  * piraat * ( pirate ) and * boekanier * ( buccaneer ) come from french . 
  * pieremachochel * ( slow boat ) comes from spanish . 
  * gids * ( guide ) , * bink * ( hunk ) and * joekel * ( large thing ) come from roma . 
  * heimwee * ( homesickness ) comes from swiss-german . 
  * piekeren * ( to mull/to rack one 's brains over ) , * pienter * ( smart ) , * amper * ( barely ) and * bakkeleien * ( to tussle ) come from indonesian . 
  * pech * ( misfortune ) and * gein * ( fun ) come from jiddisch . 
  we are seriously preparing for rising sea levels/climate change , but not doing enough to prevent it . 
  living in a small , flat , very densely populated country does n't help much . 
  plat is modern dutch for flat surface . 
  my impressions and opinions about this all are far too complicated to express in a few lines and i do n't feel like composing an essay . 
  even within the us and europe there are a lot of differences between nation/states/regions about what is legally possible and socially accepted . 
  i lived in two european countries ( i 'm dutch ) and in the us and yes , there are differences but i did n't really feel much more free or constrained in any of them . 
   do i have an overly rosy view of the eu or is my dad overly cynical ? 
  `` you are not really free in europe at all '' is complete nonsense , but of course there is a reason why your father left the netherlands . 
  some people do feel suffocated by the dutch mentality , which emphasizes practicality and consensus over vision and competition . 
  your father 's remark `` here [ the us ] u are allowed 2 shine '' certainly hist the spot . 
  does n't have an american equivalent . 
  i would definitely come to europe if you want to try it for yourself . 
  in the end , the important thing is whether a country fits your personality . 
  we have [ these ] ( http://images45.fotki.com/v148/photos/4/1741904/9670975/welkom_mat_002-vi.jpg ) ( by the way , wooden shoes are * not * worn inside the house ) . 
  in the catholic south of the netherlands this is still a thing , although not widespread . 
  not in the netherlands , at least not as a guest . 
  sorry , the uk voted wrong for that . 
  i spend a month in aruba in 1982 and had a great time . 
  i would like to visit st. maarten as my mother was born there and there is a small street named after my grandfather , but it is n't a priority . 
   more modest than that of many financially successful dutch people it is still a really expensive piece of real estate . 
  i 've got no idea . 
  pm mark rutte studied history and was a human resource manager before becoming a full-time politician . 
  his present salary is $ 13.107 per month . 
  apart from being a pm , he teaches history in a high-school two hours per week . 
  [ this is his apartment ] ( http://www.quotenet.nl/var/hearst/storage/images/quote/lijstjes/top-11-ivo-opstelten-hypotheektopper-kabinet-rutte-i/10.-mark-rutte/50835-1-dut-nl/10.-mark-rutte_img700.jpg ) , he 's a bachelor . 
  we have an beautiful official residence for the prime minister , the [ catshuis ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/everystockphoto/fspid30/72/23/77/0/everystockphoto-7223770-o.jpg ) , which was build in 1652 for jacob cats , a famous duych poet and politician . 
  mark rutte choose to stay in his own home , as many of his predecessors did , so it is only used for official receptions . 
  i ca n't remember that the wealth or lack of it of any politician here was ever a serious issue , only the amount that we pay out royal family which is really high ( the crown princess will get $ 1.500.000 yearly when she gets 18 , for example ) . 
  our king lives [ here ] ( http://www.paleizen.nl/paleizenbestanden/images%20paleizen/nederland/den%20haag/wassenaar/luchtfoto%20eikenhorst.jpg ) , has this [ palace ] ( http://restaurantervaring.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mazie-paleis.jpg ) as his office and will reside in [ this palace in the future ] ( http://images.delcampe.com/img_large/auction/000/074/378/365_001.jpg ) . 
  his net worth has never been officially mentioned or confirmed , but estimates of about $ 800.000.000 have been published . 
  are you planning to stay in hotels , youth hostels , airbnb , or camping ? 
  i have to say that the czech republic is full of castles , historic places , nice scenery , it is really cheap and i liked the food . 
  they also [ oppressed brabant and limburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generality_lands ) .

  yes , of course . 
  fun fact : the [ teutonic order ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teutonic_order ) from the crusades still exists in the netherlands and they have a cool [ headquarters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duitse_huis ) build in 1348 in utrecht . 
  apart from the fact that most of france and the netherlands would n't want part of belgium . 
  well we call it engeland in * holland * . 
  being someone who is always picking up insects and spiders , it happened one time in a lifetime and as i said , i was more surprised than hurt . 
  [ house spiders ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/grijze_huisspin ) , though large and hairy have never once bit me though i 've picked up many over the years . 
  i 'm not 100 % white but i feel european all right . 
  oh , come on . 
  [ this pretty is about the largest one in the netherlands ] ( http://www.pbase.com/glazemaker/image/83514711 ) . 
  i was bitten by one once , but was more surprised then hurt . 
  do n't worry , he 'll explain it again . 
  been to the uk four times , never been close to london , except for a stopover on your not very nice airport . 
  sorry , could n't resist . 
   while germany was brutalized by a century of war , destruction , dicatorships and division , those two countries were n't as much . 
  nice work whitewashing your history austria . 
  totally untrue unless you count the center of amsterdam . 
  the fun thing is that this statement in true for any random country except romania . 
  coming from an italian , this is really shocking . 
   dutch and flemish people : i ca n't tell if you 're trying to talk to me or clearing your throat . 
  = i am indeed talking to you . 
  = no , i am clearing my throat . 
  maybe listen to [ sophie hunger ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtnnj5ptmoi ), 
  yeah , i remember classlmates going there in the 1970 's with their parents on nudist vacations . 
  `` palermo on the meuse '' , so it might be culture shock for a north italian . 
  we 'll see whether shit-talking anyone or anything perceived as a critic or competitor is the way to run a country . 
  many areas have their characteristic farms : * [ stelp and stolp ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/stelpboerderij#/media/file:stjelp.jpg ) farms from frisia and upper north holland consisting of one high building . 
  * [ kop-hals-romp ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/oldambtster_boerderij_scheepswerfstraat_stadskanaal.jpg ) ( head-neck-body farm ) farms from frisia and groningen where the house is connected to the cowshed by a corridor . 
  * [ los hoes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/arnhem_los_hoes.jpg ) , freestanding house farm from twente and the achterhoek , where the family and the shared the same living space . 
  * [ vierkantsboerderij ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/vinksjpekhoeswkped06.jpg ) , square farm with a gate and courtyard , typical for south limburg , the one on the picture combines timber-frame construction with `` speklagen '' ( mixed bands of brick and marlstone ) * [ hallenhuis ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/slingeweg_11.jpg ) , common in many parts of the netherlands , this is one from the achterhoek . 
  * [ langevelboerderij ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/de-kaalhoef.jpg ) , long front farm , where all functional parts of the farm are next to each other with their own front doors , a type popular in brabant . 
  gelderland becoming german ? 
  i think it would work out okay , just across the border is so many dutch already and it would stimulate the dutch dialects in kleverland . 
  it 's a maximum of only two months for a permanent position , 1 month for a six month to two years contract , and not allowed for a six months or shorter contract .

  being an actual neo-nazi in the netherlands ( wearing nazi stuff , telling people hitler was great , holocaust denial ) will make you a social outcast among most circles .
