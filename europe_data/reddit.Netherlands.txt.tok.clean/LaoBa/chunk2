  that 's just because you used to visit [ grandma 's house ] ( https://www.artifex.nu/upload/410/image_paleis2.png ) all the time and now have a thing for white buildings . 
  china has surprisingly few very old buildings though , the oldest are from around 600 ad , if you do n't count underground tombs . 
  she was dutch so really tall of course . 
  also dutch , '' * om de hete brei heendraaien * '' , same saying with same meaning . 
  that looks pretty cool !, 
  [ this is also a thing ] ( http://www.schutterij-heerlerheide.nl/images/voorplaat.jpg ) in the part of the netherlands where i was born . 
  it 's right there on the map , mate . 
  it even says cardiff . 
  the present border between austria and switzerland was only set in 1972 . 
  it should be an independent state of the kingdom of the netherlands , now that we have a king on the throne again . 
  weird to see the netherlands without the duivelsberg . 
   around the netherlands no , just on the belgian-dutch border . 
  vogelbekdier ( also perry het vogelbekdier ) in dutch . 
  [ sometimes it is ] ( https://www.als.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/acs-brug1.jpg ) . 
   i thought this was standard in any european country . 
  i do n't mean swimming in urban water , i mean clean drinking water from the tap . 
   and it is an `` incredible luxury '' , he goes on , that in switzerland you can drink high-quality water straight from the tap . 
  i thought this was standard in any european country . 
  but city swimming is indeed a great luxury , i lived in z\u00fcrich and the great number of swimming spots in the city was wonderful . 
  my son is going there next year so i like it !, 
  poles have extensive experience with armed resistance against authoritarian regimes , and its limitations . 
  czechs are just really chill dudes , that helps . 
   he responsible dutch minister of defence the soldiers were sent when relus ter beek of the social-democratic pvda was minister of defense , but joris voorhoeve of the liberal-conservative vvd had been minister of defense for a year when the srebrenica massacre happened . 
  notwithstanding her very dutch name , smulders is canadian . 
  do you mean we have dicks or we are dicks ? 
  looks like the bastard child of a saucijzenbroodje and a worstenbroodje . 
  while in switzerland you are automatically the sovereign as a citizen . 
  i 'm on the internet . 
  belgium has nice bicycle infrastructure , but [ belgians being belgians ... ] ( http://www.trifinanceeurohockey2013.be/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fietspad.jpg ), 
  we have [ bike paths for thrill seekers too ] ( http://www.pinguinpablo.nl/pics/plaatjes/1490.jpg ) !, 
  it worked for me in honolulu , but ymmv . 
  yeah right , [ dutch supermarket ] ( https://gegrom.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/pindakaasmg_0635.jpg ) . 
  disclaimer : i usually just buy it when i want to make gado-gado . 
  pineapple sounds like pain-apple to us , not good marketing . 
  yes , that 's what they steal your purse for !, 
   erdnussbutter ~ peanut butter vs. pindakaas ( `` peanut cheese '' ) -  of course , for the dutch , everything is cheese . 
  pindakaas ( peanut cheese ) is actually a word that comes from suriname and was already in use in the 18th century . 
  when peanut butter was introduced to the dutch market in 1948 , the surinamese name * pindakaas * was chosen because only actual butter can be called * boter * in dutch retail , while there are other products that do n't contain cheese that were called kaas , like [ leverkaas ] ( https://versenhandig.nl/image/cache/data/vlees/dsc_5520-1000x667.jpg ) which is a kind of lunch meat . 
  it 's loopgraaf , not loopgraf . 
  notwithstanding the name , deal is actually an artillery fortress , but a wonderful design indeed . 
   beru\u0161ka i had a tin wind-up beru\u0161ka once . 
  well , no-one would call a town lissabon , would they ? 
  not a good development , just throwing a bunch of villages together . 
  no dutchman ever . 
  die verdomde beestjes , but hey who would say that ? 
  everyone loves lieveheersbeestjes .

  good governance and lots of money go a long way . 
  i added the coloring and the 1940 inundations myself . 
  well , we actually import rocks for our water works because we hardly have any rocks in the netherlands . 
  i 've had moose sausage in norway , was pretty good . 
  you call this weird ? 
  it 's a safety feature , in german deich and teich are too similar which would endanger us in crisis situations . 
  you can do it with a couple of [ bomber squadrons ] ( http://ww2today.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/raf-bomber-command-walcheren.jpg ) . 
  the picture shows the breached dike of walcheren and the sea streaming in after 240 raf bomber command aircraft bombed the dike ( november 5th , 1944 ) . 
  the island was flooded to flush out the german defenders as part of the [ battle of the scheldt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_scheldt ) [ this is the wieringermeer dike blown up by the germans on april 17th , 1945 ] ( http://www.zijpermuseum.nl/niestadt/wm/images/ns20866.jpg ) . 
  this flooded the wieringermeer polder . 
  it took 1000 kilo of explosives and additional earth removal after the blast to create this breach . 
  so , with sufficient explosives or large machinery , it is n't that hard . 
  not something that some lone wolf terrorist can do . 
  destruction of the pumping stations would also lead to flooding , albeit slower . 
  the netherlands is not a poor country and the most valuable parts are the lowest . 
  they 'll be * our * waters then !, 
  [ technically , we can cope with a 5 meter sea level rise by 2130 , but it depends a lot on policy whether we will do so ] ( https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/1987373 ),

  never forget 1839 . 
  also , it 's `` dijk '' in dutch, 
   why not fill it in instead [ you mean like this ? 
  ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4152/5097598506_ab0f1f5d42_b.jpg ) we 've been planning that for a century . 
  the germans [ had drowned 10 % of the entire netherlands ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qtfkstn.png ) by 1945 to keep the allies out . 
  it did work more or less , the western part of the netherlands was still in german hands by the time they capitulated . 
  flooding was also planned [ to keep the russians out ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ijssellinie#/media/file:kaart_ijssellinie.jpg ) during the cold war . 
  you do n't have to imagine it , [ it looked like this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/51/03/36/510336b576e932b4a8a24821999db2e0.jpg ),

   french master siegeworker ( i forgot his name ... ) [ s\u00e9bastien le prestre de vauban ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%a9bastien_le_prestre_de_vauban ) , but the netherlands had its own master siegeworker , [ menno van coehoorn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/menno_van_coehoorn ) . 
  he defended namur , a fortress of his own creation , when it was besieged by the french in 1692 . 
  namur was taken by vauban ; but the dutch engineer had his revenge three years later in the siege of namur of 1695 , when van coehoorn retook namur , despite vauban having spent the interval improving the defenses with his skill . 
  watch it or i 'll clobber your head with my wooden shoe . 
  whatever happened to `` no sex please , we 're british '' ? 
  can you please leave me to smoke in peace the next time you and your friends have a stag party in amsterdam ? 
  sorry , i did n't check the little `` show my flair '' box . 
  there should be a dutch flair . 
  it may look boring , but it has [ a camping ] ( http://www.urbanplan.nl/img/afsluitdijk/dijk13.jpg ) , a [ monument with a restaurant ] ( http://www.urbanplan.nl/img/afsluitdijk/dijk06.jpg ) , two sets of [ locks ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fcdb_onwx3e/maxresdefault.jpg ) with [ bunkers to stop the germans ] ( http://www.omropfryslan.nl/data/files/imagenodes/kaas2.jpg ) , and [ a special passage for fish is being implemented ] ( http://visserijnieuws.punt.nl/_contentimages/2014-05-20-13-24-17.vismigratie%20rivier%20afsluitdijk.jpg ), 
  nope , you are bro 's . 
  they keep telling us british people with bad teeth is a nonsense stereotype but we know better . 
  we 'll invade and tell the english to call it glorious revolution . 
  i 'll bet that will work . 
  that was a hilarious episode : the perfidious anti-france has stolen the original meter from paris and it was a national emergency as now everything was awry . 
  but of course , superdupont carries the day !, 
  putin is more articulate than that and has a certain dry humor . 
  this is trumpspeak . 
  since the uk used anti-terrorist legislation against iceland , i would n't be surprised . 
  here in the netherlands we associate the canadians with liberating us from the nazi 's . 
   30 years i think you mean the 80 years war . 
  you 're welcome to have the british stag parties back . 
  slinks away in shame . 
  i 've never seen austria labeled `` tatra '' though ...
