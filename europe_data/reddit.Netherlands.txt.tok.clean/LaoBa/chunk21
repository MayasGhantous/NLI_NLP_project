  i do n't agree with some of your remarks . 
   military worship there was a strong pacifist/anti-military movement before the war , while anti-militarism was unpopular in the 1950 's and only returned with the anti-authoritarian late ' 60 's . 
   the name anton became quite uncommon for a while nope , it [ became more popular !, 
  ] ( http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/naam/is/anton ) adolf was n't hit too [ hard by the war either ] ( http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/naam/is/adolf ) . 
  my own theory is that the leaders were always refered to as mussert and hitler in normal parlance , so their relatively common first names were n't strongly associated with them . 
   for a while , everything related to germany was despised in the netherlands . 
  yes and no . 
  while ranting against germany was acceptable , the german language was never dropped in dutch schools , german music was quite popular in the 1950 's , there was never a boycot against german goods after the war , and german tourists soon came to the netherlands again . 
  in the netherlands , the second world war did n't really influence the popularity of the name adolf , which declined only in the 1960 's . 
  dutch suicide rate is n't especially high .

  just like german switzerland is unashamed about schwiitzertuutsch . 
  i thought the north was more direct ? 
  paying for belgian roads ? 
  you always have the best jokes . 
  oh yes !, 
  we had germanic tribes , and then the romans came and colonized excatly half of the country . 
  above and below the great rivers is still an important cultural divide . 
  romans left ( their cities of nijmegen and maastricht are still there , and proud of it !, 
  ) , franks , frisians and saxons fight it out , eventually the country all becomes part of the empire of karel de grote ( charlemagne ) . 
  but there is still a cultural difference to this day between the frisian ( western and northern ) , saxon ( northeastern ) and frankish ( southeastern ) parts of the country . 
  after the split we beame part of the bourgondian and later hapsburg empire , which meant that we and our eastern neighbours , later germany would forever be separate but friendly enough except for two terrible leaders doing terrible things . 
  i 'll mention them both . 
  habsburg rule was fine but then people started writing critical stuff about the church , decided that churches were too much decorated and that picking the most strict protestant preacher , calvin , was a good idea . 
  at the same time , the habsburg emperor charles v , kind of a jolly guy who spoke dutch , left his empire to his sone phillip ii who was no fun and spoke only spanish . 
  phillip decided what the church-smashing netherlands needed was a good dose of religious persecution , central government and tax increases . 
  this infuriated about 99 % of the population . 
  dutch nobles went to protest but phillip did n't want to hear about it and had a few beheaded . 
  he also sent the duke of alva to the netherlands who was basically hitler before hitler from the dutch pov . 
  william of orange , a rich young nobleman and steward ofthe netherlands ( who had been a favorite of charles v and a long-time friend of phillip ) decided that enough was enough . 
  he drew up a declaration of independence and the dutch revolt was born . 
  living in germany , he was close to a couple of rent-an-army states so he sent his brothers to invade and liberate the netherlands and kick out the spanish . 
  it did n't work , the armies he had spend all his money on were soundly trashed by the spanish . 
  things looked bleak for the revolt , and then one of these funny history events happened . 
  the spanish had persecuted many people for their beliefs , church-smashing of tax non-compliance and a large numer of these had fled abroad . 
  the sailors among them , partly with their ships , had decided that a good way of making a living in exile was being a pirate and preying on spanish ships ( or others if the larder was empty ) and many exiled dutch nobles joined them . 
  sailing from british ports they became a serious nuisance for the spanish . 
  these were the famous sea beggars ( watergeuzen ) . 
  allthough basically a bunch of murderous ruffians , they are still our heroes today . 
  william of orange decided these guys might be usefull allies and gave them letters of marque so they were now privateers . 
  phillip sent a angry letter to queen elizabeth to stop hosting pirates and she kicked them out . 
  the homeless fleets sailed for the netherlands and reached the town of den briel . 
  this was temporary ungarrisoned by the spanish and the sea beggars decided to take over the place and ' convinced ' the city council to go along . 
  to top off the party they got a bunch of monks and priests from nearby gorkum and killed them . 
  to be continued, 
  i was actually shocked how primitive most washers in the us were compared to their european counterparts : large , use lots of energy and water , some still had large agitators . 
  there is a small protestant [ theological university ] ( https://www.tukampen.nl/ ) in kampen which is run by and for the reformed churches which are quite conservative , but otherwise , no . 
  even that university does n't have a campus so it ca n't enforce strict rules on the students outside classes . 
  small colleges are n't really a thing here . 
  you mean like the [ benelux ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benelux ) ?

  i think the woman who tunneled out of prison in breda recently did n't even lose her early discharge . 
  badly pronounced dutch with a foreign accent can be really hard to understand .

  it 's a rural thing for obvious reasons .
