   i 've always been taught to be very careful about guns , and that they are extremely dangerous and need to be handled delicately . 
  well , a lot of accidents happen trough careless/stupid gun handling , so yes . 
  we do n't really have regional politicians here , though .

  aldi is a `` reduced assortment discounter '' , so : 1 . 
  aldi is indeed not that large and and the carry no name brands . 
  european supermarkets tend to be smaller than us ones though , depending in the country . 
  shopping carts with deposits are standard in many european places . 
  has nothing to do with the safety for the area here . 
  this is a discounter thing . 
  bakery , cake decorators , deli counter , florist , butcher , seafood , lobster tanks , hot foods are much more common at normal supermarkets here , depending on the size . 
  although you 'd have to go to a french hypermarch\u00e9 for a lobster tank . 
  i 've never seen a bagger in any european country . 
  gorgeous, 
  do n't be such a mopperkont . 
  it 's okay , little buddy , they just do n't understand . 
  hey , come on !, 
  they are unfortunately almost completely gone , but they looked pretty nice .

  dutch - mother language german - tv all the time , also just 10 kilimoters away so we went there quite often . 
  later in school . 
  easy to speak , hear and read write , darn hard to write correctly . 
  lived for years in a german language country and still the cases trip me up . 
  ok , the `` german `` speaking country was a place where people actually spoke z\u00fcrit\u00fc\u00fctsch , but still . 
  english - model kits , then school and lost of english books ( i 'm a pre-internet kid ) . 
  also subtitled movies and tv . 
  french - mom went to a french church , went on vacation to france often and in school . 
  my french is still rudimentary . 
  these days , many people in france will actually use english if they hear you struggle . 
  [ kirchr\u00f6adsjer plat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz62tvmht6c&amp;t=137s ) sounds like german to us . 
  personally i like zeeuws the least . 
  nah , not really . 
  yes , my dad once bought an opel kadett stationcar in belgium ( we 're dutch ), 
  burning the national flag is in no way prohibited in the netherlands or belgium , so eu law is not involved . 
  [ anti-eu guy tries tu burn eu flag ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqrg7wh_fc0 ) . 
  [ tongue and finger of the de witt brothers ] ( https://www.haagshistorischmuseum.nl/collectie/tong-en-vinger-gebroeders-de-witt ), 
  i was n't there , personally , but we still have some pickeled pieces for when we get the munchies . 
  dutch revolt : kicked out the habsburgs and established a republic !, 
  [ tosti ] ( http://www.budgetchef.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/grilled-cheese-sandwich.jpg ) : two slices of bread with tasty dutch cheese roasted so the cheese melts . 
  some people add ham . 
  sometimes eaten with tomato ketchup . 
  actively asking ? 
  not that much , maybe once a month and i use public transportation every working day . 
  begging was prohibited until 2000 and municipalities can make their own local laws forbidding it . 
  maybe it helps that the dutch are not the most generous towards panhandlers . 
  i liked the ( probably ) romanian guy playing accordion at the station though , gave him some coins sometimes . 
  i love what we call bonbons in the netherlands , pralines in belgium . 
  lots of wonderful small brands like [ visser chocolade ] ( http://www.visserchocolade.nl/en/ ) . 
  belgian brands like leonidas and australian are also good , though not as good as the small ones . 
   not the people suffering from it . 
  some people enjoy it immensely . 
  i do n't . 
  stop with your fantasies . 
  only part of great britain to suffer german occupation . 
  i would ask / r/switzerland . 
  making fondue yourself takes good swiss cheese and preferably a swiss wine . 
  i know people who bought kitchens in germany . 
  it is more popular in the eastern parts of the country . 
  if you buy a car in another country it has a foreign plate and you will have to import it to get a local plate , while driving with a foreign plate if you do n't live abroad is prohibited . 
  i 'm from the netherlands and when i was young , my parents bought a car in belgium and sometimes went to germany for cheap petrol . 
  both were close-by ( like 10 miles ) . 
  we also went to germany to buy model trains , my uncle went there a couple of times per year to buy photo supplies and equipment . 
  dental care for kids under 18 * is * covered by basic health insurance , ( cosmetic ) braces are n't . 
  my son rehearsing his scholarly report `` are conlangs a form of art ? '', 
  that he has to give in school on tuesday . 
  lax business rules and switzerland ? 
  you 're in for a rude awakening . 
  i 'm upset about right-wing populism too but i 'd be demonstrating in the streets if elections were cancelled for that reason . 
  wonderful . 
   the 1925 one looks more like 1825 almost ... very traditional architecturally . 
  yes , i was amazed too . 
   oh , and that lab . 
  drool `` amsterdamse school '' , a dutch expressionist architectural movement 1910-1930 . 
  i love that building too . 
  as a student i had lectures and lab work there , it 's a monument now .

  the town center was rebuild after being [ heavily damaged in 1940 ] ( http://www.wo2meteigenogen.nl/wp-content/gallery/hoogstraat-slide/hoogstraat_0.jpg ), 
  i 'd pick cremation because it is cheapest and i do n't want my family to spend a lot of money on something i wo n't enjoy myself , but if money was no objection i 'd choose a nice marble grave with art nouveau decorations in san michele or morcote . 
  as an idiot . 
  i was very disappointed by the election of trump but the us is a democracy and i do n't see why they should be `` destroyed '' for this .
