  french : coeur de pirate : [ place de la republique and adieu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmssvsvkdge ) ( she 's actually canadian and sings mostly in french , also a talented piano player ) buridane : [ sors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi0hforzlvq ) pierre bachelet : [ les corons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxarmiqdipm ) i love this song because i grew up in old mining town . 
  italy : mattia bazar : [ piccoli giganti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sxdynx17o8 ) best known for their 1985 megahit ti sento . 
  modena city ramblers : [ bella ciao ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ycqoiotyy ) irish inspired band with many left wing themes in their songs , like this rendition of the famous song of the italian partisans in world war 2 . 
  i do too , she 's canadian though . 
  there are 11 public holidays although some people do have to work on them : new years day ( january 1st ) , easter ( friday and monday ) , kings day ( april 27th ) , liberation day ( may 5th , every 5 years for the private sector , yearly for government employees ) , ascension , pentecost , christmas ( december 15th and 26th ) . 
  in the south many businesses close for three days for carnaval ( mardi gras ), 
  * overlawyered . 
  even the preschool that our daughter went to had the phone number of their lawyer listed . 
  wtf ? 
  lots of things that seem to be handled by insurance in europe are apparently settled by lawsuits in the us . 
  * is it * that hard * to put the actual price on tags , not something where tax will be added when you pay ? 
  * arriving at hilo airport and finding there is no public transport whatsoever although the town is right next to the airport ( there is a bus now , 8 times daily . 
  yay ! ), 
  yes , car ownership of 18 year olds is probably much lower in europe, 
  eurovison is more that the song festival . 
  we used to have our european eurovision hunger games : [ jeux sans frontieres ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxt--bbk2v8 ), 
  we got half a million belgian refugees at the beginning of the war although many of them returned within a few months when the fighting had passed most of the country . 
   every high schooler has the pleasure of learning all about wwi [ not all of them retain it very well though ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5k49zlxqdk ), 
  we were n't even in it and [ found german trenches recently ] ( http://historiek.net/enige-loopgraaf-eerste-wereldoorlog-op-nederlandse-bodem-in-ere-hersteld/42975/ ) !, 
  ( article in dutch ), 
  i live in a smaller town ( 35,000 people ) and have been using public transport most of my life , it is pretty good although in general it takes more time to get somewhere that by car . 
  one of the great things is that we have a single website ( 9292 . nl ) which combines information of all public transport so you just have to type your destination and you know how to get there and how much time it will take . 
  i remember pre-internet times when this was much more difficult . 
  yes , heard of them all , although i know most about john henry . 
  but most people in the netherlands hav n't heard of them .

  i not they do n't give numbers how much time europeans spend commuting ( hint : i assume it is just as high ) . 
  we 're a family of four in a 35,000 people city/town . 
  we do n't own a car , we are members of a car-share organisation . 
  there is a car-free/reduced traffic city center with shops and twice-weekly market ( 2.3 km , 10 minutes by bike ) . 
  there are supermarkets in most neighborhoods , the closest from my house is at 800 meter ( supermarket , greengrocer , baker , cheese shop , alcohol store , chinese and italian restaurant and snack-bar ) all neighborhoods apart from the main roads are 30 km/h roads . 
  there are bicycle paths on all main roads . 
  we do almost everything inside the city by bike . 
  there is a bus stop within 200 meter which takes me to the station when i go to work . 
  i mostly take my bicycle . 
  my wife works within walking distance of our house . 
  my daughter goes to university in our town ( by bicycle ) and my son goes to school in a neighboring town ( 10 km , he goes by bicycle ) . 
  we use a car about once or twice per month , if we have to move larger stuff or want to go to a place that takes too much time to reach by public transport . 
  for the summer vacation , we either rent a car or take the train to the airport . 
  that being said , most people in our situation own a car . 
  70 % of all households in the netherlands have at least one car . 
  but people with cars will still use bicycles a lot for inner city moves . 
  pictures !, 
  the netherlands recently raised the minimum age for buying alcohol from 16 to 18 so they are pretty strict at the moment to show they mean it , both to th 16 year olds and to the providers of alcohol . 
  hey , we 'd lose the [ duivelsberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duivelsberg ) to germany !, 
  no way !,

  [ my hometown ] ( http://www.secureinair.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/luchtfoto-markt-kerk-wageningen-bevrijdingsfestival-4-5-mei.jpg ) was unfortunately shot to pieces by dutch artillery in 1940 when it was occupied by the germans , although the center was more 17th/18th century anyway . 
  it was rebuild in 1942 and then again damaged during the battle of arnhem . 
  the church is medieval , and most of the city moat is still there . 
  i 've visited the frisian islands of [ schiermonnikoog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schiermonnikoog ) ( by ferry ) and [ engelsmanplaat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/engelsmanplaat ) ( walked ! ), 
  which is not considered an island any more but was a bit larger in the past . 
  also the zeeland islands of [ zuid-beveland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zuid-beveland ) , [ goeree-overflakkee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goeree-overflakkee ) , [ schouwen-duiveland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schouwen-duiveland ) and [ walcheren ] . 
  and the overseas islands of [ aruba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aruba ) and [ cura\u00e7ao ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cura%c3%a7ao ) . 
  abroad i 've visited jersey ( by hydrofoil from france ) , britain ( by ferry and by plane ) , iceland , hawai\u02bbi , maui , oahu , kaua\u02bbi , venice , lido di venezia , murano , burano , torcello and st. michele . 
  belgian navy was weak so not capable of conquering any island in 1830 . 
  it was a long time ago ( 1988 ) but i stayed at [ beishida ] ( http://english.bnu.edu.cn/ ) in beijing for half a year doing agronomy research , then i traveled with my girlfriend to shanghai , suzhou , kunming , dali , lijiang , leshan , emei shan and chengdu , all by train and bus , and then we went home to the netherlands by train through mongolia , the ussr , poland , the gdr , and germany . 
  all in all , a wonderful experience . 
  [ u zij de glorie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utk6r7tfiiw ) ( a toi la gloire/thine be the glory ) has always be one of my favorites . 
  it 's not bad , although there is room for improvement , especially with the vmbo ( lowest level secondary school ) . 
  china . 
  i lived there for half a year and i read a lot about chinese history and culture . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  there are about 150,000 houses with thatched roofs in the country . 
  but yes , fire insurance is more expensive as well as maintenance . 
  it is very good isolation though . 
  in some cities it 's 21 and the government wants to make 21 the minimum age countrywide . 
  do many new thatched houses get build ? 
  in the netherlands they are fairly common . 
  yes , that was after all those romans left . 
  superior dutch throats just need a glas of milk or beer now and then . 
  and there is a reason we eat so much * drop * . 
  [ like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxufsyzxxs4 ) . 
  rich people from amsterdam tend to speak accentless dutch . 
  [ dijkgraaf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dijkgraaf_\\ ( official \\ ) ) , or dike-reeve who is the chair of a [ water board ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_board_\\ ( the_netherlands \\ ) ) and as such comparable to a mayor or provincial governor . 
  the water boards are a paralel system of local governance in the netherlands that dates from medieval times which recognizes that water-management was an issue that could not be run independently by every locality . 
  it literally means count of the dikes . 
  the water boards are responsible for making sure that their area of responsibility is protected against floods , is drained if necessary and gets enough water in summer . 
  there are elections for these boards where every householder can vote . 
  [ clog makers ] ( http://www.eenrumerklompen.nl/productieproces.html ) have become rare as most * klompen * ( clogs ) sold are cheap industrial products from poplar wood instead of hand-carved willow clogs . 
  some other countries have them , but [ thatchers ] ( http://www.rietdekkersbedrijfdaemen.nl/fotos.html ) are serious business here . 
  edit : non-mobile spelling check, 
  i was in china in the 1980 's and whenever i said `` helan '' , chinese for the netherlands , people would smile and either name a soccer player like van basten or `` philipu '' , i.e. 
  philips , as their products had a very high reputation in china at the time . 
  i 'm old enough to remember milk being sold in glass bottles . 
  vampire the masquerade : bloodlines, 
  however , that does n't mean that it is n't a social taboo to work as a prostitute and even more to visit prostitutes as a man . 
  italy might be the only country where a renaissance fair is simply a fair they they have continued since the renaissance . 
  / r/amsterdam , ask in / r/thenetherlands too, 
  surrender jokes is almost completely anglo-saxon phenomenon , as they were n't overrun by the french all the time having a channel in-between or were just friends . 
  older ones : [ wien ne\u00earlands bloed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdyo83o6vje ) ( whoever has dutch blood flowing in their veins ) was our anthem from 1815 to 1932 . 
  [ de \u00e2lde friezen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blftdqas3pg ) ( the old frisians ) is the frisian anthem . 
  and more modern ones : [ the nits - in the dutch mountains ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpyizi_wrxw ) . 
  somewhat surreal song that makes of lot of sense if you know the netherlands .
