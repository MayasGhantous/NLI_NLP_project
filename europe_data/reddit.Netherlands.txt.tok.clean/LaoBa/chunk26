  there are many smaller ones at historical places , my friends are medieval re-enactors and often go to castles and medieval towns to take part . 
  the expression renaissance festival or renaissance fair is not really used here .

  i used to live in a place where it was 8 kilometers to the belgian border and 7.2 kilometers to the german border by bicycle . 
  we visited the other countries quite often . 
  we only put it on bread , not on cakes . 
  [ we have many more sweet stuff to put on bread ] ( https://weltessen.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/hagelslag2.jpg ) , like chocolate flakes [ dark ] ( http://www.itsalldutchtome.com.au/images/113.jpg ) , [ milk ] ( http://www.recensiekoning.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/112.jpg ) , or [ white ] ( https://www.kaasfondueshop.nl/media/catalog/product/cache/4/image/1eacbb0ca04ec2ce0d30c4c74b2f14ab/d/e/de_ruyter_vlokken-wit.jpg ) , sugar sprinkles [ like this ] ( https://www.voedingswaardetabel.nl/_lib/img/prod/big/vruchtenhagel.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://hollandshopper.nl/image/cache/catalog/products/food/breakfast/hails/de%20ruijter%20bosvruchtenhagel%20los-600x600_0.jpg ) or [ aniseed-sugar sprinkels ] ( http://www.efooddepot.com/images/products/b/24435_2.jpg ) or [ aniseed-sugar powder ] ( http://hollandshopper.nl/image/cache/catalog/products/food/breakfast/hails/de%20ruijter%20gestampte%20muisjes%20los-600x600_0.jpg ) or crunchy aniseed sprinkles like [ this ] ( https://londoneats.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/muisjes.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.worldwideholland.com/images/productimages/big/muisjes-blauw.png ) or [ this ] ( http://www.rd.nl/image/policy:1.99749:1467205714/bij-de-geboorte-van-beatrix-maakte-de-ruijter-voor-het-eerst-wit-met-oranje-muisjes.jpg?f=16x9&amp;$p$f=21744c2 ) ( orange ones are only available when a prince or princess of orange has been born ) . 
  sarah , [ there are 10,105 women called sarah in the netherlands ] ( https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/naam/is/sarah ) ( although a substantial part are german and british ) , as you can see the name only became popular from 1970 on . 
  the original dutch spelling of your name is sara , [ there are 11,635 sara 's in the netherlands ] ( https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/naam/is/sara ) and this name is also becoming more popular again after a dip around the 1970 's .

  getting a lot of money !, 
  maybe he thinks it 's the dutch flag . 
  dutch wikipedia is wikipedia because that 's how you write it in dutch to pronounce it as wikipedia . 
  i had a more modern toilet installed in my 1967 house , yes . 
  used to be common in the netherlands too . 
  you pay a fee set by the government . 
  non-eu foreigners pay a lot more . 
  dutch people can get a very low interest loan . 
   small town atmosphere ?

  as for memorials , the [ netherlands american cemetery and memorial ] ( https://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials/europe/netherlands-american-cemetery ) is impressive . 
  other war cemeteries are the [ ysselsteyn german war cemetery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ysselsteyn_german_war_cemetery ) ( more than 31.000 graves , largest in the netherlands ) and the [ airborne cemetery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arnhem_oosterbeek_war_cemetery ) . 
  all interesting books , but none of them written by an actual german citizen at the time . 
  i shall bear witness : the diaries of victor klemperer 1933-41 is a great start . 
  you 're welcome . 
  and yeah , do 24 is super cool , designed in germany to dutch specifications , served with german , dutch , australian , spanish and swedish forces during the war !, 
  [ the national military museum ] ( https://www.nmm.nl/ ) of the netherlands at soesterberg is brand-new and has lots of interesting exhibits , including planes ( like my favorite , the magnificent [ dornier do 24 seaplane ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dornier_do_24#/media/file:dornier_do_24_on_display.jpg ) ) and vehicles ( including a renault ft-17 tank ) . 
  [ the dutch navy museum ] ( http://www.marinemuseum.nl/ ) in den helder has an excellent collection and three ships to visit : the 19th century ironclad schorpioen , the world war 2 minesweeper abraham crijnssen , famous for escaping the japanese by disguising itself as an island , and the 1960 diesel submarine tonijn . 
  after the hard-fought but almost forgotten [ battle of overloon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_overloon ) , a large number of armoured vehicles left on the battlefield were kept in an collection which is now the [ war museum overloon ] ( https://www.oorlogsmuseum.nl/en/home/ ) . 
  the museum has lots of tanks : shermans , cromwell , panther , hetzer , challenger , t-34 , archer , sexton , is-2 , as well as a couple of 88 mm guns . 
  there are a number of museums dedicated to operation market garden . 
  the [ airborne museum ] ( http://en.airbornemuseum.nl/ ) in oosterbeek is located in the hotel hartenstijn , the command post of the british paratroops during the battle . 
  the museum is not very large but has good exhibits , and a sherman tank and a 17 pounder gun outside . 
  the [ liberation museum ] ( http://www.bevrijdingsmuseum.nl/basis.aspx?tid=746 ) in groesbeek has more on the american side on the battle . 
  [ the dutch cavalry museum ] ( http://www.cavaleriemuseum.nl/ ) in amersfoort has a collection of military vehicles . 
  [ the aviodrome ] ( https://www.aviodrome.nl/aircraft-theme-park-netherlands/ ) in lelystad is an airplane museum that has both civilian and military airplanes . 
  the netherlands has many interesting fortifications . 
  [ naarden ] ( http://www.vestingmuseum.nl/ ) and [ bourtange ] ( http://www.bourtange.nl/ ) are two towns with complete 17th century star fortifications and museums . 
  some of the 19th century fortresses of the dutch water line can be visited . 
  some dutch and german bunkers of the second world war can also be visted , like the [ bunker museum kornwerderzand ] ( http://www.kazemattenmuseum.nl/ ) . 
  just rip them to pieces with your ship 's propeller . 
  tulips : yes , in certain parts of the country . 
  windmills : yes , visit one if you 're in the netherlands , they 're cool . 
  land that will disappear : we have excellent flood protection and contingency plans for major climate change . 
  even our climate-change denial party ca n't affort to stop the work on that . 
  the german thing is especuially annoying since it has very [ unsavory associations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic-ss ) . 
  also , prostitution is legalized but it is still a social taboo . 
   it 's about as easy to learn as many other european languages . 
  maybe it 's easy to pronounce but non-indoeuropean languages are harder . 
  the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg have their own union which started in 1944 , kind of a mini-eu with its own parliament , court of justice and customs union . 
  one of the results of this was that from juli 1st , 1960 , there were no longer border controls between the benelux countries and free movement of capital , labor , goods and services was established . 
  in a way , the [ benelux ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benelux ) could be seen as a small scale eu/schengen experiment . 
  i grew up in the netehrlands close to both the belgian and german borders . 
  because of the benelux , even in the 1970 's there were no border controls on the belgian border , you could see the abandoned border posts . 
  at the german border , you would sometimes be waved through , at other times they checked passports on every car , and , when there had been recent terrorist activity , also the trunk . 
  depends whether zombies can swim :-), 
  by the way , two more dutchies : [ father and daughter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvg5ellgsm8 ) , academy award 2000 for short animated film . 
  [ anna and bella ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0qnxozxqga ) , academy award 1985 for short animated film . 
  just a warning , watch your luggage like a hawk on that train trip , thieves unfortunately know that that train is full of packed and jet-lagged tourists . 
  most likely you will be fine anyway , but better safe then sorry . 
  switzerland , the netherlands and luxembourg ? 
   consider this , if these types of immigrants were indeed racists they 'd hardly immigrate to multicultural countries . 
  that is nonsense , people migrate to countries whose values they do n't share all the time for economic reasons . 
   i know the westerners are saying that romania/bulgaria etc. 
  do n't like them i never hear that here . 
   you do n't see neonazis immigrating to izrael for example just to get benefits right ? 
  they actually had some problems . 
  there are jewish neo-nazis too , although not many . 
  no , it 's swiss . 
  * hongerige wolf ( * hungry wolf * ) * boerenhol ( * farmers ( ass ) hole * ) * de dood ( * death * ) * doodstil ( * death quiet * ) * fonteinsnol ( * fountain whore * ) * kampeersnol ( * camping whore * ) * kuttingen ( * cunt-tingen * ) * monster ( * monster * ) * pikveld ( * dick field * ) * poepershoek ( * shitter 's corner * ) * raar ( * strange * ) * rectum ( * rectum * ) * vrouwenverdriet ( * women 's sorrow * ) most of these are villages or hamlets . 
   germany is flooding the german speaking world with their german german media , to the point that the younger generations do n't even or only barely know their own german varieties and/or consider them wrong . 
  did n't notice this * at all * in switzerland . 
  i think you are trying to flood them with germans now .
