  mashed potatoes mixed with kale , for example . 
   common breakfast items bread , with cheese , sliced meat , jam , [ sweet sprinkles ] ( http://www.rietveldimaging.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/overzicht2.jpg ) or chocolate/nut spreads . 
   cereals all imported stuff like kellogs corn flakes and quaker oats  common beverages milk , coffee , tea , water . 
   common condiments traditional are pepper , nutmeg , cloves , cinnamon and juniper berries . 
  traditional dutch is one of the few cuisines which still serve vegetables like green beans or cauliflower with grated nutmeg or cloves as was common in the renaissance . 
  tomato ketchup , curry ketchup , mustard and mayonaise . 
  we also use indonesian spices and condiments like ginger , galanga , lemon grass , sambal and kecap . 
   when it comes to pasta do you buy dry pasta/canned sauce or make from scratch ? 
  personally i usually make the sauce myself but buy dry or fresh pasta , although sometimes i make lasagna or ravioli from flour . 
  but you can buy lost of ready-made sauces . 
   common alcoholic beverages ? 
  beer , both lager and craft beers . 
  also wine . 
  we also produce lots of distilled drinks like jenever , beerenburg and many liqueurs . 
   i am also curious about if you eat a lot of smoked meats . 
  here in canada , i have built a custom large smoke shack and could not imagine eating meat that has not been smoked first . 
  most popular are [ smoked sausage ] ( https://www.voedingswaardetabel.nl/_lib/img/prod/big/rookworstmager.jpg ) eaten with mashed potato dishes , and [ smoked horse ] ( http://www.voordeelmuis.nl/img/gif/1370/1370029.gif ) or cow meat in slices on sandwiches . 
  apart from that , rarely . 
  smoked fish ( especially eel ) is also popular . 
  lots of great cheeses , some favorites are dutch cheeses like remeker , beemster , old gouda or veenendaler goat cheese . 
  swiss cheeses like appenzeller and gruyere are also wonderful , as well as many french cheeses . 
  gorgonzola and gorgonzola-mascapone are great too . 
  but my absolute favorite is roquefort . 
  the most expensive neighborhood is a wooded area with large houses [ like this ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/124010908.jpg ) . 
  actually , this one is used as a refugee center . 
   hopefully the eu will have job-placement services only for citizens . 
   i 'd be politely shown the error of my ways that depends a lot of the culture , if the people will be polite and if you will perceive it as polite . 
   armed resistance movements why ? 
  you can chose article 50 too if you want . 
  you can vote for local parties , the mayor is supposed to be a unifying , not a divisive person in a municipality . 
   my car has heating in the winter and ventilation/ac in the summer belgian trains have n't ? 
   i 'll find a suitable employer who will sponsor me a work visa your employer must arrange a work visa before you come to europe . 
  theoretically you could meet a potential employer while here on a tourist visa who is so impressed that he will start the procedure , while you go back to the us and wait , but i find that highly unlikely . 
  anchor steam is n't half bad . 
  also , when i lived in the us , any generic lager was okay to drink at the beach if it was cold . 
  french wine !, 
  st. pierre and miquelon plv !, 
  from the netherlands the last few years : ** train ** : visit friends in switzerland ( night train to zurich , very comfortable ) , city trips to berlin , lille , paris . 
  ** car ** : camping vacations to belgium , czech republic , scotland ( took an overnight car ferry to newcastle ) ** plane ** : camping vacation to iceland , city trip to athens . 
  all have their advantages and disadvantages , apart from pricing . 
  car : * pro : most independence , easiest in the countryside , most luggage , can stop anywhere on a whim . 
  * contra : slow over long distance , driving requires concentration , driving and parking in cities is a hassle , need to return to car after a hike . 
  train : * pro : very comfortable and relaxing unless overcrowded , takes you right to the heart of the city , no check-in hassle , allows you to make overland hiking trips , no luggage weight limits , wonderful views , sometimes wifi available on train . 
  * contra : slow if distances get too long , handling luggage can be a hassle , some risk of luggage thieves on long distance trains . 
  plane : * pro : fastest on long distances * contra : limited luggage , airports are usually inconveniently located , check-in is always a hassle and eats up time . 
  law and order ^ tm is also a big thing in the vvd . 
  health insurance premiums may rise more than expected . 
  this is a blow to the ruling parties with elections coming up as they just presented a new budget that predicted a rise in income for about everyone , but now this may be wiped out by the increased health premiums for low-income people . 
  premiums are set by private companies , but they tend too follow the trendsetters rather closely . 
  i feel the eu and my country are getting the fallout for something that was 80 % internal british politics : politicians worried about their party and their personal prospects , newspapers and politicians blaming the eu for every problem under the sun , people voting leave because they were fed-up with tory austerity and nhs privatization . 
  the way british politics reacted after brexit has n't changed my opinion much . 
  i expect the `` mean `` eu being scapegoated for a long time for future british problems . 
  / r/igotout might be of interest too . 
  you are hopefully aware that eu freedom of movement has * nothing * to do with vacations ? 
  cd was invented in the netherlands too . 
  not really . 
  there are some new-age people but i 've never heard of any neo-pagan movement . 
  no , but we have [ this to show the classy and cultured side of the netherlands ] ( http://loldutchpeople.nl/ ) . 
  some nsfw . 
  `` my '' dialect ( i do n't speak it well but i understand it fine ) is limburgs . 
  limburgs is spoken in part of the netherlands , belgiumand germany . 
  we have our own [ wikipedia ] ( https://li.wikipedia.org/wiki/veurblaad ) . 
  contrary to dutch and german , limburgs is a tonal language . 
  it is a lower frankonian dialect , that has been influenced by colognian and brabant dialect and by french . 
  although usually sung in dutch , both the dutch and belgian limburg provinces ahve the same anthem . 
  i 'm most familiar with dutch variants of limburgs , feel free to add some belgian and german videos . 
  [ carboon - et zjwatte loak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx94prohzru ) . 
  et zjwatte loak ( dutch : het zwarte gat , german : das schwarze loch ) means the black hole and is a rant by a young man who has to work in the mines because it is a family tradition . 
  ( geleen-sittard dialect ) [ benny neyman en andr\u00e9 rieu - maastricht ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3owdsqonf6s ) introduction in limburgs by andre rieu ( who is a native speaker ) , followed by a song in dutch , german , english , french and limburgs ( from 4,22 ) !, 
  ( maastricht dialect ) [ wiel knipa - limburg plat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekwdclinooc ) : song about limburgs dialect with scrolling text . 
  ( heerlen dialect ) [ janse bagge bend - sollicitere ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvjdv-w1bfc ) : song about unemployment and job hunting from the 1980 's , was one of the few songs in limburgs that became a nationwide hit . 
  ( echt / susteren dialect ), 
  country is popular enough in germany that walter moers made this [ song about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgzjox94r0q ) . 
   where do the fans come from ? 
  in the netherlands , typical country fans are people above forty with lower education levels , it is definitely a working class and rural phenomenon . 
  hey luxembro !, 
   shared currency nonononono , they had belgian francs and we had guilders . 
  because its clear to everyone . 
  they 're swiss . 
  duinkerken you mean ? 
  czech campings have lots of dutch visitors these days . 
  there also a couple of dutch people who run campings there days . 
  worse as in lower standard of living ? 
  yes . 
  worse in other ways ? 
  not really . 
  certain people look more northern/southern/eastern , but it is always hit or miss . 
  [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f4spusu_mk ), 
  / r/interrail might be of help, 
  good choice , i 'm a railway fan but amsterdam-venice is just not a good connection and will be expensive . 
   the only thing worth visiting is saint marco 's square i would n't agree with that , it is the whole city that gives off an amazing feel , i mean , have you ever wandered a city for hours without encountering a car ? 
  just explore the city and do n't care too much about must sees . 
  in december it will be pretty quiet in venice anyway . 
  by the way , i really liked visiting the cemetery island san michele ( you can just take the water bus ) , again there is n't a specific attraction there but i loved the whole atmosphere of this `` island of the dead '' . 
  burano is also nice . 
  if you do want to visit the anne frank house , definitely book in advance . 
  they 're pretty much okay and seem to make a lot of progress .
