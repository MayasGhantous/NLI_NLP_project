   you will find russia helped liberating germany until the russian revolution , `` russian day '' was a day in the netherlands where we celebrated our liberation from the french by the russians . 
  yes , if you get the concept of gezelligheid . 
   how is the hussein regime/the `` defenders '' viewed in comparison to the invaders / `` liberators '' ? 
  we did n't like the hussein regime but few people saw a connection between 9/11 or a need to invade . 
  we neither viewed the us as invaders nor as liberators , it was clear the target was to topple saddam hussein . 
   how are the various insurgent groups viewed in your country ? 
  the kurds have a relatively good press here , all arab insurgents are seen as scary muslims . 
  if there were no terrorist attacks in europe or refugees i think most people would n't care much . 
  yes , this sums up pretty much what you learn in dutch school .

  * dutch * ancient greek * english * mathematics * physics * chemistry * biology you do a school and state exam on these subjects and then you are eligible for most universities in the netherlands . 
  my dutch students society used to organize hitch-hiking contests to places like brussels or even rome . 
  like 50 people hitchhiked central netherlands to brussels . 
  so yes , it is pretty doable and not particularly dangerous . 
  the way you look will have a major impact on your hitchhiking success , as well as the places where you hitchhike . 
  always make sure cars can safely stop to pick you up .

  swedes : blonde , prosperous , commit a lot of crimes that are solved by people with relationship trouble and seems mostly a result of societal alienation , or patriarchy . 
  norwegians : have a lot more country than people . 
  drink to get drunk , not to enjoy the drink . 
  danes : feels like they are a dutch province that drifted away , apart from the language it 's hard to find a difference . 
  i mean , their country is even flatter than ours . 
  icelanders : friendly and best vacation country but they 've got our money .

  you get it ?

  certain comedians also think that lots and lots of swearing is edgy and funny .

  it was kind of the place where every dutch family who went to france went in the late 1970 's . 
  i remember going to the moezel/mosel/moselle river , a narrow valley with a railway track with steam trains we had to cross to reach the river ( you had to use an intercom to get the railway crossing to open !, 
  ) , aufschnitt for breakfast and making a tour on the river in a white ship .

  this resulted in several days of rioting in the neighborhood . 
  you 're welcome and ( i hope ) few visits to dutch healthcare . 
  thanks , you are right . 
   coming from a country with nhs style insurance this is all a bit confusing to be honest . 
  it is . 
  the website of your insurer should have all information , unfortunately probably in dutch only . 
  do n't pin me down on this but the basics are like this : deductible : medicine blood tests ambulance hospital treatment and stay visits to a specialist no deductible : general practitioner ( huisarts ) birth and maternity care everything for persons under 18 ( kids have no deductible )  what medication is covered by insurance . 
  everything that you need to get a ~ ~ recipe ~ ~ prescription for should be covered , while over the counter medicine like paracetamol is n't . 
  note that dental care and physiotherapy are ** not ** covered by basic health insurance and you need to buy additional coverage ( aanvullende verzekering ) for this if you want , or pay out of pocket . 
  in general the simplest additional additional coverage is n't very expensive and offers a lot . 
  for everything paid by additional coverage , there is no deductible . 
  the government spends a lot of money on healthcare and healthcare related costs ( 28.5 % of our national budget ) , so yes . 
  the netherlands : we do n't have free healthcare , you pay for mandatory insurance ( like $ 90 per month , but low-income people get a generous allowance from the government to pay for this ) and you have a yearly deductible of about $ 380 for specialist treatments . 
  it works fine in general . 
   are long wait times really a thing ? 
  not really . 
  for some non-acute things , there are waiting lists of a couple of months . 
   is seeing a specialist any harder or more costly ? 
  you must see a gp first to get a reference for a specialist , they act as screeners . 
  but if you need to see a specialist it is never a problem . 
  visiting a specialist is covered by insurance ( apart from the deductible ) . 
  in germany , unions are serious negotiation partners , while the us managers came in with the walmart philosophy `` unions = the devil '' , which led to no end of trouble . 
  well , that is pretty close to dutch , i 'm in gelderland myself . 
  no , it is n't . 
  there is an urban legend that the dutch made up silly/obscene names during the * french * occupation of the netherlands ( 1810-1813 ) when family names became obligatory , but that is n't borne out by historical research , even though we have some completely crazy family names . 
  by the time of the german occupation the netherlands had one of the most accurate registration systems in the world , so there was no way people could make up names . 
  dutch words that sound strange/offensive in english : * dik ( dick ) = fat * kunt ( cunt ) = ( you ) can * kok ( cock ) = cook * fok/fokker ( fuck/fucker ) = breed/breeder * neger ( nigger ) = negro ( neger in dutch is becoming un-pc for that reason ) there are people called dick cock in the netherlands . 
  or [ tiny kox ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiny_kox ) dutch words that look strange in english * [ die ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/jeg2fkg ) = that * worst = sausage dutch words that look/sound strange in french * nu ( nu ) = now english words that sound strange/offensive in dutch : * cut = kut ( cunt ) * lull = lul ( cock ), 
  lets raise doggerland !, 
  26 % of the dutch want a republic ( 15 % really want a republic , 11 % do n't mind the present monarchy but would still prefer a republic ) . 
  not much of a chance . 
  most likely way to end the monarchy would be a scandal . 
  we use `` bleekselderij '' for the stalks and `` knolselderij '' for the root . 
  we were phd students at the time and did n't have that much money , but the quality of life is simply great . 
   it 's only fair to say that this is the case in all europe .
