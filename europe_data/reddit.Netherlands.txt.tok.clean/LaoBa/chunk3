  lidl used to have fantastic wasabi chips when they had asian week , but they stopped selling them . 
  so yes , benelux was first . 
  it has almost completely disappeared and is only worn in a few communities , most places have no traditional dress at all . 
  i was in the small town of spakenburg recently and there i saw a few women wearing [ this ] ( http://www.museumspakenburg.nl/files/2613/9037/9817/klederdracht.jpg ) . 
  benevolent parenting means setting boundaries , but also respecting your child , not letting them do whatever they want . 
  and physical punishment is illegal here , and not much used in parenting . 
  [ 15 miljoen mensen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioxymmnoe-o ) ( 15 million people ) is the thing that comes closest . 
  and the jopenkerk . 
  i loved living in z\u00fcrich , wonderful city especially in summer with so many places to swim in the open air . 
  interestingly enough , in one of the most conservative christian villages of the netherlands premartial sex was traditionally allowed for a serious fiance to see if the bride to be would get pregnant . 
   but if neighbours informed the police ( this is a very swiss thing ) they had to act . 
  oh yes , definitely . 
  that 's what the swiss police told us concerning moving house on easter sunday , the police did n't really mind but if the neighbors complained they would have to stop us . 
  my swiss boss told me he got into trouble with this around 1980 , his landlord gave him a month to get married , otherwise he and his girlfriend would be kicked out . 
  everyday on public transport , stations and the campus where i work . 
  my hometown has an international university so i also see quite a lot of them , both domestic and foreign . 
  i worked for a while in a place where a fellow software engineer wore one , she was indonesian . 
  no but there are too many poor schools there . 
  it says [ chatham ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chatham,_kent ) in the upper right corner which was conquered by the marines during the raid on the medway . 
  the big cities are expensive but still quite livable , and mid-sized towns and the countryside are not remote , schools are pretty good almost anywhere in the netherlands ( oost groningen might be a bid dodgy ) , we have mostly planned cities so there are always facilities like parks and pools within cycling distance , so it mostly comes down to jobs and housing prices . 
  ambition is fine but * do * it , do n't talk about it . 
  and we expect you to show a bit of class and humbleness once you 've accomplished your ambition . 
  [ colors of the royal netherlands marine corps ] ( http://imgur.com/b8ilux5 ) [ queen beatrix and princess maxima greeting the colors ] ( http://imgur.com/f3osawn ) [ marines on parade in rotterdam ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lwrg835mv_8/maxresdefault.jpg ) some others : [ huzaren van boreel ] ( https://magazines.defensie.nl/binaries/large/content/gallery/magazines/00-defensiekrant/2014/18/overzicht-prinsjesdag/_mp41488.jpg ) hussars , founded 1813 . 
  [ regiment infanterie johan willem friso ] ( http://www.lc.nl/images/f8x6sg-infanterie7.jpg/alternates/wide_768/infanterie7.jpg ) : line infantry , founded 1950 but carries on the traditions of the first infantry regiment of the dutch army back to 1577 . 
  [ regiment limburgse jagers ] ( https://www.limburgsejagers.nl/content/images/stories/erewachtdenhaag.jpg ) , light infantry founded 1813 . 
  apart from the 19th century uniforms , they also have [ these ones with tropical hats ] ( http://tpo.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1vanheutszindieherdenking.jpg ) and the feared klewang ( sabre ) . 
  heinz polzer , known as drs.

   edit : and of course our queen who is from argentina in fact , all our rulers consorts since the independence of the netherlands have been foreign . 
  louis napoleon , king of the netherlands , was french . 
   it looks like gambling only exists in impoverished places it is legal in all or nearly all european countries . 
   amsterdam especially , the sarphatistraat , most beautiful spot of europe . 
  nothing much . 
  well , i enjoyed `` the maine massacre '' by jan willem van de wetering . 
  no , when i think in another language , the switch it total . 
  [ worst thing ] ( http://esqnl.h-cdn.co/assets/16/01/768x427/1451882065-duitser.jpg ), 
  the royal netherlands marine corps was founded in 1665 . 
  they are the only non-uk unit worldwide to have a british mainland battle honour on their colors . 
  other regiments also carry the traditions of units formed in the napoleonic wars , the second world war , and those of the knil ( royal dutch-indonesian army ) . 
  almere is the `` cheap overflow '' area of amsterdam , so a lot of people who ca n't afford to live in amsterdam move there , which accounts for the fast growth . 
  being build on non-historic land means that almere can easily be expanded . 
   almost seemed a little sterile yes , this is the main complaint . 
  villages ? 
  men ? 
  planes ? 
  birds ? 
  i love z\u00fcrich but [ bern ] ( http://img.myswitzerland.com/662347/325 ) and [ fribourg ] ( http://img.myswitzerland.com/mys/n64490/images/buehne/st0035479-2.jpg ) are prettier . 
  [ almere ] ( http://medias.photodeck.com/a127e0e1-55a5-4fc9-8006-f3d0b61aba6b/300013_xgaplus.jpg ) is the 7th largest city of the netherlands and is completely planned , there was n't a single building before 1976 and before 1957 the whole area was water . 
  an earlier planned city is [ lelystad ] ( http://rondje-ijsselmeer.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lelystad.jpg ) , building started in 1967 . 
  both cities , although planned with good intentions for livability , have a reputation of being boring and uninteresting , not unlike milton keynes . 
  only in tourist places like amsterdam . 
  it must be added that in may places moluccans are well-integrated and not a problem at all . 
  satoka tamaki , a japanese student films my hometown , main street , market , the meadows along the rhine , the university campus . 
  if you grow up 15 minutes from the german and 15 minutes from the french language area ... 
  yes , there were terrorist actions in the 1970 's by moluccans , trains , a community center and and a school taken hostage leading to several people killed . 
  today , moluccans are reasonable well integrated although [ there are still some troubles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satudarah ) . 
  no , the oldest use of mof for german is from 1572 . 
  the etymology is n't clear . 
  mofrika was also used for germany as a slur, 
  the only koreans i 've met in the netherlands were adopted by dutch families as babies or toddlers . 
  if you are talking about asian minorities , there are many distinct ones in the netherlands : [ dutch-indonesians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indo_people ) , [ suriname javanese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/javanese_surinamese#netherlands ) , indonesians , chinese , [ moluccans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moluccans ) , [ suriname indians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indians_in_the_netherlands ) , indians and vietnamese . 
  moffen for germans and jappen for japanese . 
  this is very much a ww2 and aftermath thing , so they are n't much used today . 
  i translated koine text ( leucippe and clitophon by achilles tatius , fun book by the way ) in secondary school , but even people who had classical greek in school are usually far from fluent , it is mostly translating . 
  yes . 
  i remember foreign names for hitler : russian : slarotimof ( beat up that jerry ) japanese : foetsjimoesti ( he should be gone ) chinese : hang kreng hang ( hang asshole hang ! ), 
  there are quite a number of stone age burial mounds in the woods around my town , most people do n't know about them . 
  they 're not very exciting , apart for their age . 
  outlets are always secured pretty well here . 
   it also exists in german then i do n't understand the whole `` scheveningen '' thing . 
  i would expect them to be recent immigrants . 
   led by a country who had literally hitler as a leader this whole `` leader of the free world '' non-sense or eu = germany is something i only see in the anglo-saxon press . 
  my wife started a community project where a small piece of unused municipal ground has been turned into 8 vegetable gardens , so we have a vegetable garden just 100 feet from our garden . 
  in our back garden we have herbs , rhubarb and three small berry bushes , in the vegetable garden we grow peas , beans , zucchini , patison , tomatillo , beets , endives , butternut squash , and jerusalem artichoke . 
  not counting water surface , you 're never more than 2 kilometer away from a building in the netherlands . 
  i visited [ this island ] ( http://defotograaf.eu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/jvh_40871.jpg ) by walking trough the sea/over the mudflats . 
  it 's called rottumerplaat and it is uninhabited . 
  when you start walking form the mainland , it looks something like [ this ] ( https://hotspotholland.nl/vakantie/rottumerplaat-overzicht510x210.jpg ) . 
  it was wonderful . 
  that being said , due to the small size of our country no place feels really remote . 
  europe does n't really do superheroes . 
  it is a very american comics genre . 
  the netherlands has lots of comics , but the only `` superhero '' one is [ a parody ] ( http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/soeperman3.jpg ) . 
  dutch revolt-golden age 1568-1700, 
  [ broederliefde ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t490xfxklo4 ) is the most streamed band on spotify in the netherlands . 
  france ( near pont du gard ) and germany ( munich ) . 
  my wife has family in the uk ( peterborough ) . 
  house in a row with three living floors and front and back garden , build 1967 . 
  we enlarged the 2nd floor and put solar on the roof . 
  about 50km to my job . 
  or `` i 'm an american who hates america , please love me eurobros '', 
  in my experience , some are confused about hawaii , haiti and tahiti .
