  your parents had belongings ? 
  is no belongings . 
  only cold . 
  and hunger . 
  and gulag . 
  such is life . 
  i lived in z\u00farich for years and i loved it . 
  i would be right on the lake shore now if i was there !, 
  same in the netherlands . 
  most dutch saying of them all : * doe maar normaal , dan doe je al gek genoeg . 
  * - just act normal , that 's already crazy enough . 
  * kinderen die vragen worden overgeslagen * : kids who ask for a treat will be skipped . 
  a dutch saying . 
  limburgers have an inferiority complex , something you 'll never find in a texan . 
  greenland has , but population/economywise its a dwarf . 
   a car will get you there faster in general , this is true . 
  i use a lot of public transport in the netherlands and the equivalent car ride ( unless you get rush hour in the major cities ) is always faster . 
  on the other hand , driving is work for me , while on the bus/train i read and relax . 
  if you find something a horror then do n't do it on vacation . 
   public transport will get you into rural areas or natural parks in many countries , it will . 
  public transport trips : athene -  cape sounio rome -  villa d'este and villa adriana z\u00fcrich -  lots of trips into all kinds of places in switzerland , like braunwald , walensee , limmattal , z\u00fcrcher oberland . 
  one of the things i like when i 'm going hiking in the countryside is that you do n't have to return to your starting point if you use public transport . 
  the red is blood . 
  tourist blood . 
  yes , it 's impossible to make day trips out of capital cities by public transport . 
  i really ca n't say . 
  i 've lived and vacationed in europe for 50 years and there are still so many regions that i would love to visit . 
  see nature , van gogh and battle of arnhem museums !, 
  konmar , a supermarket chain that grew as a discounter decided to upgrade their supermarkets to challenge the high-end market leader albert heyn . 
  unfortunately , this operation started in 2000 and the downturn in the economy combined with mismanagement lead to the near backrupcy of the chain and the eventural sale of all the konmar supermarkets to ther brands . 
  not my country , but [ walmart 's unsuccesful foray into germany ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-macaray/why-did-walmart-leave-ger_b_940542.html ) is legendary . 
  yes , that is a famous one . 
  none . 
   each country has castles & palaces in europe except iceland . 
  german speaking part of switzerland also uses merci ( of merci vielmol ! ), 
  no , we have mandatory insurance which is definitely not free ( euro 70-100 per month ) , there is a minimum yearly deductible of 350 euro for adults . 
  you can choose your own insurance plan and they have a long list of things that they should cover by law , also they can not refuse you for pre-existing conditions so you can shop and switch every year if you want , or change your deductible . 
  people with low incomes get a government subsidy to help them pay for the insurance . 
  there is a separate scheme for people who are opposed to health insurance on religious grounds !, 
  * safety : i feel pretty safe going anywhere and i feel safe from the police too . 
  * bicycle infrastructure : i can cycle everywhere and let my kids cycle everywhere too without worries . 
  * good schools available everywhere . 
  * boring politics . 
  it 's not a spectator sport . 
  * well-planned cities with walkable centers, 
  the mods behave these days ... 
  they 're both real these days , but / r/thenetherlands has much more traffic than / r/netherlands . 
  both of them . 
  * hunger * is probably the only norwegina book i 've ever read apart from a couple of thor heyerdahl books ( great reads by the way , kon-tiki is a classic adventure story ) and i can really recommend it . 
  it would be great to have our canadian friends closer . 
  1 bicycle . 
  use it daily . 
  also use trains , buses and car-share . 
  middle-aged fully employed family man . 
  it works the same as in english so it feels natural to us . 
  how it works in practice if op were to try this : `` hey , how khaat it ? '', 
  `` i 'm fine , you ? '', 
  `` er , fine as well . '', 
  one beer . 
  `` one beer coming up ! '', 
  [ kingdom of the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_netherlands ), 
  we are about the only country that systematically enlarges itself without stealing land from the neighbors . 
  if putin had only asked us we would have build him a whole new crimea . 
  [ beautiful almere ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/kasteel_van_almere_maart_2012.jpg ) . 
  oss used to have a pretty bead reputation too . 
   i 'm not sure about the `` bad cities '' in belgium . 
  what ? 
  come on . 
  you have charleroi !, 
  limburg is in two countries now so both have limburgse vlaai !, 
  i moved 150 kilometers because there was only one university that offered the subject that i wanted to study . 
  most people move out from home while studying to be more independent . 
  we have friends ? 
  we have four bins : organic waste , packaging ( plastic , metal , coated paper ) , paper and mixed trash , which are collected every two weeks . 
  there is also a recycling center where you can bring all kind of stuff from reusable and recyclable to toxic waste . 
  this is free , and you can borrow [ a trailer or bakfiets ] ( https://www.acv-groep.nl/wageningen/afvalbrengstation/uitleen-aanhanger-bakfiets ) for free for a few hours to bring the larger stuff there . 
  the municipality will also pick up certain special kinds of trash at your house by prior appointment for a small fee . 
  you pay a standard amount per household per year for trash removal depending on house type and number of household members . 
  it 's part of my family history as my mom was born on st. maarten and my dad on java . 
  you are looking for something like [ this ] ( http://www.wgjtukker.nl/trekvogelpad/foto's%20voor%20web/11.1%20versiering%20onder%20viaduct.jpg ) ? 
  [ nighttime view ] ( http://kunstinede.nl/sites/default/files/imagecache/kunstwerk_thickbox/hoff-peters.jpg ) . 
  it 's a highway underpass in ede , the netherlands . 
  * i * would look at my tickets , guidebook and maps too if i saw * that * sign !, 
  not in the netherlands , where the ratio inhabitants/forest is somewhat unfortunate and every small child is warned against picking mushrooms from a young age . 
  we are the second-largest mushroom producers of europe though ( 250,000 tons per year ) , only poland produces more . 
  also : * never go [ mudflat walking ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/wadlopen_bij_pieterburen_02a.jpg ) without a guide . 
  you can drown . 
  * beaches on the large rivers like the rhine are fine for getting your toes wet but swimming there is extremely dangerous . 
  * if you * have * to try drugs when you are in the netherlands , never buy them in the streets . 
  go to a shop , ask for instructions if you are an inexperienced user , and make sure there is a designated sober person in the group . 
  * always watch for bicycles when crossing the street , do n't mistake the red bicycle paths for sidewalks . 
  you wo n't die but you 'll be shouted at and/or get hurt . 
   do they fall in and drown ?
