  very little except disney and stuff like that gets dubbed in my country . 
  i love to hear the original language . 
  make limburg great again !, 
  doggerland is ours !, 
  we are all super liberal . 
  you call the people who had the most active terrorist movements of western europe until recently the least fanatic ? 
  mostly french , belgian and dutch comics . 
  and donald duck , but those are written in italy these days . 
   do you have many animal rights organizations/activists ? 
  some , yes . 
  de dierenbescherming ( animal protection ) is the largest , wakker dier ( awake animal ) is the best known activist groep . 
  one unique thing is that we have a political party ( partij voor de dieren , party for the animals ) that has a seat in parliament . 
   animal shelters ? 
  every town has one . 
   is animal abuse taken seriously ? 
  cruelty to animals ? 
  yes , it is illegal and police will arrest people for active cruelty or severe neglect . 
  whether the large-scale rearing and slaughtering of animals for meat is `` cruelty '' is a matter of public debate . 
  is veganism `` popular '' 0,1 % of the population is vegan , 1.7 % is strictly vegetarian and 14 % is `` mostly vegetarian '' . 
  so no , veganism is n't very popular . 
  orphans get 368 to 667 euro per month from the government , depending on their age , until they are 16 ( or 21 ) , and an additional amount if their parents had a pension plan with their employer . 
  if not living with relatives , orphans will be placed in guest families . 
  [ bicycle infrastructure !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cycling_in_the_netherlands ) i think many countries could profit from this . 
  france : * un long dimanche de fian\u00e7ailles / a very long engagement - a wonderful and terrifying story of a young woman looking for her missing fiance after world war one . 
  * il faut tuer birgit haas / birgit haas must be killed - a french secret service helps out their german colleagues who want a released left-wing terrorist killed . 
  but one of the french agents has his own agenda . 
  * trois couleurs : bleu / three colors : blue - one of a trilogy based on the french flag colors , and freedom , equality , brotherhood . 
  a young woman loses everyone she cares for and struggles how to deal with this unwanted `` freedom '' . 
  * ridicule - comedy set at the french court shortly before the revolution where a young nobleman from the provinces finds that wit counts for more than arguments when he tries to find support for a project in his home county . 
  belgium : * le huiti\u00e8me jour / the eighth day : a workaholic businessman somehow gets stuck with a young man with down syndrome . 
  germany : * lola rennt / run lola run !, 
  - a tense , comedic and completely original movie where the story plays with destiny and fate . 
  * gegen die wand / head-on - two young turkish-germans , an alcoholic and a young woman who yearns for freedom from her conservative family , meet after failed suicide attempts and marry out of convenience . 
  sweden : * l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in / let the right one in - wonderfully creepy movie about a lonely and bullied teen boy who befriends the mysterious young girl that comes to live in his apartment building . 
  * fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l / show me love - two very different teen girls try to deal with being a teen in an utterly boring small town . 
  italian : * il ladro di bambini / the stolen children - a young policeman escorts two children who are sent from one children 's home to another and slowly opens up to them . 
  i 've worked in switzerland , the netherlands and in the us and did n't notice much difference in work ethic in my field . 
  working hours were longest in switzerland . 
   \u00f8lsmugglere hey i understand that one . 
   often exude a sense of menace `` the scariest white people '', 
  * you * are the ones that do n't have a honorific in your language and do n't use them when speaking dutch :-), 
  [ world war 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5k49zlxqdk ), 
   ditch speaking kom op , vlaams is geen taal van de goot !, 
  try / r/interrail, 
  you can take a cat ( in a box ) for free on almost all trains , a small dog in a container is also free , a larger dog will need a ticket and must be muzzled on some trains . 
  we moved from switzerland to the netherlands by renting a minibus as ph.d. students . 
  if you can return the bus , you can rent with small local companies which might be much cheaper that the larger ones like hertz etc. 
  for 113 kg you would n't need a minibus though if you are with two people . 
  we do n't have fraternities/sororities like in the us . 
  however , we have * studentengezelligheidsverenigingen * ( usually called * studentenverenigingen * ) . 
  these are students societies whose primary aim is social , as opposed to things like sport clubs or study societies . 
  many of the * studentenverenigingen * have a rich history , the oldest date from the 19th century . 
  originally they represented the `` pillars '' of dutch society , so you would have the corpora which were liberal ( in the classical sense of the word , not the modern american usage ) , more left wing ones , and the catholic and protestant societies that were linked with particular churches . 
  the religious aspect is mostly gone in the larger ones , leading to the founding of new , smaller christian students societies . 
  typically , the students society will have a building that has a bar ( alcohol is allowed from 18 in the netherlands ) and/or disco , sometimes a restaurant , offices and activity rooms . 
  these are run by the students themselves with only a few hired personnel like cleaners . 
  membership will be between 100 to 2000 members . 
  almost all of them are coed these days . 
  membership is usually open to all students , but you will have to join at the beginning of the year , and join for an introduction process which is partly optional , required , or even includes hazing depending on the society . 
  in the past , shaving the heads of all new students was part of this , this disappeared in the 1970 's . 
  there are lots of activities throughout the year and active members are supposed to visit at least weekly , although this is usually not enforced . 
  there are usually a lot of clubs , commissions and sub-societies . 
  stereotypes : non-members often see these societies as arrogant or elitist places where people drink a lot of beer and treat each other in a childish way . 
  members usually find a place with like-minded people where they have fun , learn a lot of organizational and people 's skills , often find a partner , and get friends for life . 
  about 8 % of all students in the netherlands are members . 
  [ it was based on this i saw a long time ago ] ( http://deadspin.com/infographic-is-your-states-highest-paid-employee-a-co-489635228 ) , which only mentions state universities . 
   `` sort of like dutch , but different '' excellent description of flemish . 
  yes , it was strongest in the 1980 's but we have lots of `` belgians are stupid '' jokes . 
  they have pretty good `` dutch are stingy '' jokes in revenge . 
  but sometimes we wonder ... [ miss belgium candidate in action ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5k49zlxqdk ), 
   the only thing our two countries agree on well , there must be more as france was the most popular vacation destination for the netherlands for decades ( germany recently became # 1 ) . 
  depends what you are looking for . 
  in general , yes . 
  * almost everyone speaks english and many university courses , especially master courses are in english . 
  * the quality of our universities is excellent , we do n't have a single `` star '' university but all of them do very well in international ratings . 
  ( note that * universities of applied sciences * in the netherlands are a different education level ) * world 's best cycling infrastructure . 
  * excellent public transportation . 
  * low crime rates . 
  * central location in western europe . 
  * no terribly cold winters or terribly hot summers . 
  * walk-able and livable cities . 
  many universities are located in historic cities . 
  but : * tuition for non-eu students can be pretty high . 
  * it can rain a lot . 
  * housing tends to be small and expensive . 
  * if you are here for just a limited time it can be hard to break out of the `` foreign student bubble '' ( not that the foreign student community ca n't be a lot of fun ) . 
  * our universities have no football stadiums , emphasis is on sports participation , not spectator-ship . 
  is n't the highest paid employee in many american universities the football coach ? 
  i grew up close to both the belgian and the german borders in the netherlands . 
  because of the benelux , the dutch-belgian border has been mostly open and unguarded for a very long time already . 
  however , if we visited germany we would pass a boder post where we often had to stop and show our passport . 
  during the height of the raf/baader meinhof terror , car inspections were pretty common . 
  but it was just a nuisance , we often went to germany to go hiking , shopping for model trains , or just to buy cheap car gas/petrol . 
  it is very cool that i can just drive to czechia on vacation now . 
  yes , bonaire , saba and st. eustatius are dutch municipalities and part of the netherlands , and through the netherlands also part of the kingdom of the netherlands , of course . 
  no , i 'm not talking about the kingdom of the netherlands , there are dutch municipalities that have papiament or english as official languages ( they are in the carribean , though ) . 
   are you living in the abc-islands or in the netherlands itself ? 
  technically , b is teh netehrlands and a & c kingdom of the netherlands :-) i live in the continental netherlands but my mother was born on st. maarten . 
  i would love to go there on vacation some time , it sounds beautiful .
