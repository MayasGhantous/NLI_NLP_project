  my mother is in a care facility because of her parkinsons and the polish nurse who is her first line responsible caregiver is absolutely fantastic . 
  the netherlands : nederlands ( dutch ) , frysk ( frisian ) , papiamen ( papiamento ) and english ( english ) . 
  my mother grew up in an english-speaking part of the netherlands ( that is now a sovereign country ) .

  he got 20 years in appeal and tbs . 
  tbs is non-voluntary treatment .

  stupid people or ( neo ) nazis . 
  yes , ours are red with the blood of tourists . 
  * go biking around ( if you are not a total traffic hazard ) . 
  there is a country-wide bicycle network . 
  or just wander around one of the many walkable city centers . 
  * visit a working windmill . 
  there are lots of them and it is always impressive to see these age-old machines running . 
  * see some dutch masters , those paintings are really great . 
  * leave amsterdam and see more of the country . 
  use our trains . 
  * try hot kibbeling ( fried fish ) at a market stall or kapsalon at a shoarma restaurant . 
  * enjoy a bit of the countryside . 
  we may be a densely populated country but there are lots of places where you can have nice walks or bicycle tours .

  i would n't say `` i 'm from the netherlands , europe . '', 
  though . 
  i assume many americans would say either their state or the us , but not both . 
  i 've got little idea how european other dutch people feel . 
  there are only a small number of us personnel stationed in the netherlands , mostly officers . 
  i ca n't remember any outrage , actually the worst thing recently was [ a former member of the u.s. air force , now an anti-militarist killing a dutch guy with an axe ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-dutch-murder-axe-idusl1275507320070912 ) ( he wanted to kill a soldier to protest the war in iraq and afghanistan ) . 
  he was n't an active service member or stationed in the netherlands , he was mostly perceived here as being crazy . 
  he received a 15 year prison sentence . 
  not very , we are rather private .
