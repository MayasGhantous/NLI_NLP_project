  personally , if a national culture needs `` an enemy '' or `` someone to look down on '' , it smacks of massive insecurity to me . 
  i tend not to drink soda in restaurants . 
  dutch , english , german , some french , some faintly remembered chinese . 
  i had dutch , english , german , french , classical greek and latin in school .

  [ bl\u00f8f & heather nova - mooie dag ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfhowwynb8o ), 
  i would go on vacation with my family to other countries from the time that i was too young too remember : germany , switzerland , belgium . 
  later ( age 6 and up ) we would go a couple of weeks to france in the summer , or to switzerland and once to italian tyrol . 
  we would take the car so it was always like one or two days driving . 
  it was great fun : playing in rivers and streams , hiking , visting interesting historic places , eating foreign food , nice hot weather . 
  good times . 
  we went to france with our school when i was 17 . 
  also wonderful . 
  by the way , i grew up in a place where you could be in germany or belgium in less than half an hour , so we often went over the border . 
  the belgian border was already open at the time ( benelux ) but to go to germany you would be stopped and checked , especially when there had been recent terrorist actions . 
  now we go on a yearly summer vacation , usually abroad ( last ten years : france , scotland , germany , california , czech republic , iceland ) and about every two years we make a city trip , we went visiting friends in switzerland this spring and a long weekend to lille last autumn . 
  my wife and i have lived abroad several times and definitly used that opportunity to travel too . 
  lekker has a lot of meanings in dutch , in this case i would say : dank je , dat is lekker makkelijk !, 
  = thank you , that is nice and convenient . 
  other uses of lekker : voedzaam en lekker = nuticious and tasty . 
  = just take your bike with you on the train . 
  = man , what a hot girl . 
  = it 's going to be a nice day again . 
  nou , lekker is dat = ( literally ) that 's nice . 
  ( actual meaning : i 'm pissed off by this situation ) . 
  they do n't really stand out here in western europe , and i 've never been to the balkan . 
  / r/amsterdam has an extensive wiki which includes good tourist tips . 
   try rampant nudity or sexuality in say munich , or basel can you walk nude trough z\u00fcrich , switzerland ? 
  not really . 
  can you swim nude in the city ? 
  yes , there are three places ( strandbad katzensee , werdinsel au/h \u00f6ngg and strandbad tiefenbrunnen ) . 
  i do n't think having a couple of nude bathing places is common in us cities . 
  / r/iwantout might be useful . 
  also , many european country subreddits have immigration information . 
  96 % , not a native speaker , though i lived in hawai\u02bbi for 18 months . 
   you said yes to 96 % of the existing words . 
   you said yes to 0 % of the nonwords . 
   this gives you a corrected score of 96 % - 0 % = 96 % . 
  painful , however , that one of the words i did n't recognize ( hemelytron ) is an entomological term and i studied entomology . 
  claiming all greek/latin scientific terms like this as english is a bit of a stretch though in my opinion . 
  catalan ? 
  portuguese ? 
   but you can not all understand what we say but you can not understand all that we say . 
  nothing bastardized about dutch though , it 's a full-fledged sister of the german and english languages . 
  yes , it is part of a dialect continuum that defies the borders , as versions of it are spoken in belgium , the netherlands and germany . 
  it is , gelaens , a version of [ zuid-limburgisch ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/limburgisch ) or s\u00fcdniederfr\u00e4nkisch in germany . 
  it is not the same as k\u00f6lsch , which is ripuarian , but k\u00f3lsch is easy to understand for us . 
  ver wete toch allemoal dat get ver kalle in gelaen is get jederein kint versjtoan !, 
  of b\u00e8s te afcent ?

  all the series have been broadcast but hard-core fandom is rare . 
  / r/amsterdam has an excellent wiki with more information . 
  also , what do you think of the political climate in the netherlands ? 
  modern yodeling is awesome , it is the very old-fashioned songs that you often hear that give yodeling an old-fashioned image . 
  fan of christine lauterburg . 
  i agree . 
   cornelis vreeswijk dutch glory !, 
  we only have one king or queen in my country , so on average we 're not living like kings and queens . 
  life is good , though . 
  more shameful dutch things : highest percentage of jews killed in world war . 
  lots of dutch ss volunteers . 
  apartheid society in the dutch east indies . 
  portugal is the only country where a man 's mistress tends to be uglier than his wife . 
  this is true : [ people were required to hand in their bicycles in 1942 unless they got an exception ] ( http://www.dedokwerker.nl/images/fiets_03.jpg ) . 
  people who do n't hand them over are threatened with severe punishment . 
  in the summer of 1942 the german occupier ordered the dutch population to hand in their bicycles for the german army . 
  however , most were so old as to be useless . 
  this only resulted in about 100 usable bicycles for the germans . 
  as a result , the germans started rounding up cyclists in the streets and confiscating their bicycles . 
  this got them some 53,000 bicycles , but led to a lot of unrest and the germans stopped their action , because the enormous loss of face was n't worth it . 
  in the last war year , many retreating german soldiers stole bicycles . 
  from 1943 it was almost impossible to get a new bicycle because the entire dutch production was sent to germany . 
  bicycle theft was rife and people feared further german confiscations so many people hid their good bicycles for the rest of the war . 
  frisian : [ twarres - wer bisto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=366ztb-2vbi ), 
  we give presents on december 6th , sinterklaas ( st nicolas ) . 
  this is a bit of a taboo to discuss with strangers in my country , but i 'm middle aged with a pretty affordable mortgage . 
  has no study dept and am now paying my kids studies so they get to make a clean start too . 
  fortunately they have [ fox news ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ocbxllz.jpg ) to educate them !, 
   5 years of `` being 1 country '' , the wwii occupation , sealed the deal and basically made us indistinguishable . 
  i hope he never repeats that in a dutch cafe after everyone has had a couple of beers . 
  well , we keep the `` loldutchpeople '' away from foreign perception too . 
  they tend to post on dutch language forums only . 
  [ sorry , belgium ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yljzd853sic ),

  i do n't think the average english speaker can understand [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le_ungdpa4c ) either . 
  i can only understand scumbag . 
  european , so british english of course . 
  for your information , the netherlands is also bombing daesh and fighting on the ground in mali . 
  i lived in a us state which is in many ways quite different from the rest of the us ( had a student from kansas who had a total culture shock ) bit still a lot of the things that other people remark on in this post apply . 
  some other stuff : open air markets are much more common in europe . 
  us , from what i have seen , has much smaller farmers markets . 
  more vacation in europe and ( i 'm form a small country ) everyone goes abroad while in the us for obvious reasons ( expenses , time , lots of the us to visit ) most people stay in the us . 
  the tv news is much more focused on the us only in the us . 
  the us is much more litigious , it seems like a country by lawyers for lawyers . 
  when we got the information for our preschool for example , they listed the telephone number of their lawyers !, 
  why would a preschool need lawyers ? 
  another thing here is that europeans insure while americans sue . 
  i was surprised to hear at a lab safety course at my us university that a student would would get in a lab accident would have to sue the university for damages , my european university was simply insured for this ( and any students medical costs would be covered anyway ) .
