  for all of its in your face christianity , christmas is much more commercial and less religious in the us than in my country where 50 % of the population do not profess to any religion . 
  it helps that we do n't give presents at christmas in my country , no `` black friday '' nonsense . 
  yes the `` i pay so i make the rules '' mentality is strong in the us , combines with much less protection against being fired . 
   would you have preferred that the bef had been annihilated in some pointless last stand backed up against the sea in dunkirk no , the british had sound reasons fro retreating , but i find it ironic that the `` miracle of dunkirk '' is widely known and the french defense of dunkirk and the somme is forgotten and laughed away . 
  because now that movie is the only thing many people with only pop-culture knowledge will know about belgium , and they think it is funny or appropriate to bring up quotes every time belgium is mentioned , like the `` what 's belgium famous for ? 
  chocolates and child abuse , and they only invented the chocolates to get to the kids . '', 
  one . 
  even there it is n't funny . 
  they lost , but they did fight , continuing even when their main ally retreated to their island . 
  declaring paris an open city saved a lot of civilians as the franceo-prussian war of the sieges of st. petersburg and berlin were to show . 
  most are pretty okay . 
  but : do n't treat a city as a theme park , it 's not disneyland , people live there . 
  respect that . 
  do n't be an obnoxious drunk or druggie . 
  these little wheeled suitcases make a hell of a noise on cobblestones at night . 
  do n't turn your airbnb appartment into party central , your direct neighbors are usually people with kids who have to work the next morning . 
  the fact that english is widely spoken in europe does n't entitle you to to loud complaints if something is n't translated/available in english . 
  ( if you are an english speaker ) : we hear what you are saying to your travel companions . 
  remember that . 
  treat churches , mosques , synagogues , cemetaries and monuments with respect , and do n't step into places where you are n't allowed to get that perfect picture . 
  hey , i 'm from a mining area myself and still plan to do the route der industriekultur . 
  and the braunkohle mines are pretty impressive . 
  there is a reason why stag parties are n't welcome in many places in amsterdam . 
  remember , bicycle paths are the color of tourist blood . 
  the rebels is not one group , once the regime would be out of the picture a new civil war between rebel factions would start . 
  i think it is kind of funny in the movie ( although the joke would work with any nationality ) but it is annoying that people who know apparently nothing about the netherlands but this bring it up all the time . 
  i feel for the belgians since `` in bruges '' has reached the us . 
   ww2 thing into a joke note that while france was quickly overrun i the beginning of world war 2 , but not without stiff resistance . 
  they inflicted most of the casualities on the germans after the british had fled . 
  [ siege of paris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_paris_\\ ( 1870 % e2 % 80 % 9371 \\ ) ) : 24,000 french soldiers dead or wounded , 47,000 civilian casualties . 
  i love my country but we do n't do that much in terms of christmas displays/markets in the netherlands ( it 's mostly a family celebration ) and the weather will most likely be cold and grey . 
  chances for snow are better in southern germany and the alps . 
  it 's a rather useless comparison , russia was its own country while the south was part of the us . 
   for britain , it 's always been france . 
  well then why did you fight four wars with us ? 
  you actually allied with france against us . 
  our traditional rival is the uk , though . 
  germany was this big , unorganized but friendly neighbor for centuries . 
  only in the 20th century things changed . 
  bikes : * we have probably the most extensive bicycle infrastructure of any country in the world , and are still improving on it . 
  * there are more bikes then people in the netherlands . 
  * our teenage crown princess cycles to school . 
  * children get cycling traffic lessons in school . 
  * we are still pissed about the germans taking our bicycles during the occupation in world war 2 . 
  food : * raw fermented herring is a popular food that is sold on any market . 
  * some indonesian dishes have become part of dutch food culture . 
  * horse meat is commonly eaten on sandwiches . 
  * we have [ this ] ( https://dayennefoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/beschuit-muisjes.jpg ) to eat when a baby is born . 
  society : * having your living room window on the street side with the curtains open in the evening shows everyone you are decent people with nothing to hide . 
  * the dutch flag with a school bag shows that your kid has just graduated high-school . 
  * in some schools , kids have to study six languages ( dutch , english , french , german , classic greek , latin ) . 
  * all schools are government paid , also the religious ones . 
  * in many families , parents are okay with teens having their boy/girlfriends spending the night occasionally . 
  * at a birthday , you congratulate the person having his/her birthday , but also parents/siblings ( congratulations on your brothers birthday ) . 
  thank you for sharing your superior american insight and opinions . 
  * in de aap gelogeerd zijn - sleeping in the monkey * : be in trouble . 
  - are you totally sniffed by rats ? 
  * : have you gone crazy ? 
  i 'm not a foody either , but some mushrooms are very tasty compared to champignons/agaricus . 
  in switzerland there are official places where you can have the mushrooms you picked checked for safety . 
  [ swiss society of official mushroom checking organisations ] ( http://www.vapko.ch/index.php/de/ ) . 
  for example , in the city of z\u00fcrich [ there are eight locations ] ( http://www.vapko.ch/index.php/de/eine-pilzkontrollstelle-finden?search=zurich&amp;searchrayon=15 ) where you can have your mushrooms checked . 
  for free !, 
  it 's 502 for the netherlands , and wolves are predicted to settle here in the near future !, 
  holland has a population density of 1163 . 
  no wolves there . 
  solution : rent more dutch prisons . 
  there was an applebee 's in the town where i grew up but it only opened after i left . 
  for visual material/artsy locations : lots of pretty towns and good museums in the netherlands . 
  it 's a small country so you can visit most parts as a daytrip from the central area . 
  some suggestions : [ the netherlands institute for sound and vision ] ( http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en ) : lots of stuff that might interest you in a cool modern building . 
  the netherlands has won oscars in animation and all of that stuff can be seen there . 
  [ kr\u00f6ller-m\u00fcller museum ] ( http://krollermuller.nl/visit ) : lots of van gogh , other impressionist and modernist paintings , a wonderful scuplture garden around the museum , all set in the heart of a national park . 
  you can also visit this [ beautiful art noveau castle ] ( https://www.hogeveluwe.nl/en/discover-the-park/art-and-architecture/jachthuis-sint-hubertus ) with original interior , it 's close by ( there are free bicyles at the museum ) . 
  note you need to make a reservation for a guided tour if you want to see the interior of the castle . 
  amsterdam is wonderful but * packed * with tourists most of the summer , try to see more of the netherlands than just that city . 
  it has some of the best art museums of the netherlands , though ( rijksmuseum , van gogh museum , stedelijk museum ) . 
  rotterdam has no picturesque centre thanks to large scale [ `` renovation '' by the luftwaffe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/rotterdam%2c_laurenskerk%2c_na_bombardement_van_mei_1940.jpg ) but it has lots of [ modern architecture ] ( https://www.markthal.nl/en/story-of-the-building ) , two cool art museums ( booymans and kunsthal ) and a hard-core party scene . 
  utrecht is the most central city for public transport and has canals with much less tourists than amsterdam . 
  the hague is not the most interesting city , although it has the mauritshuis museum ( lots of dutch masters ) escher museum and a [ pretty 19th century panorama ] ( http://www.panorama-mesdag.nl/english/ ) smaller cities like haarlen , leiden , delft , dordrecht and alkmaar have very pretty canals too . 
  amersfoort is a town that is not really touristy but has a really pretty historic center with three gorgeous medieval gates . 
  this is [ one of them ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/koppelpoort_amersfoort_cropped.jpg ) . 
  small/tiny historic towns : buren , elburg , [ thorn ] ( https://tallsay.com/page/4294975383/thorn-het-witte-stadje-aan-de-maas ) , [ bourtange ] ( http://www.amazingplacesonearth.com/fort-bourtange-netherlands/ ) . 
  bourtange is quite out of the way for the netherlands though . 
  you can find more picturesque small places on [ mooistedorpjes.nl ] ( http://www.mooistedorpjes.nl/landen/nederland/ ) : they are sorted by province on the page . 
  note that giethoorn is very pretty ( a farmers venice ) but also very touristy . 
  volendam and zaanse schans also attract a lot of foreign toerists . 
  castles : muiderslot ( mostly historic ) , [ haarzuilens ] ( https://fietsenopdefiets.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/p1090047.jpg ) ( 19th century fairy tale castle ) you can get almost anywhere in the netherlands by public transport , [ this website ] ( http://9292.nl/en# ) will show you what trains/buses to take . 
  however , if you want to visit a lot of places in a province in a short time , getting a car might be more practical . 
  yes , especially in the inner city of amsterdam , where you can earn big money by buying an appartment and renting it out year round . 
  around 8 or 9 , both watered wine ( mom has some french cultural inluence ) and shot glasses of beer with the nasi goreng . 
  the way the british speak in asterix in the uk is so funny , is n't it ? 
   beate uhse beate uhse is n't kinky , she was a nice hausfrau and former nazi era test pilot . 
   `` has umlauts ? 
  then it 's german '' foreigners ca n't see the difference between an umlaut and a trema . 
  bestiality porn was legal in the netherlands until quite recent ... 
  build in 1967 . 
  oldest building today is nothing special either . 
  i 've slept in my swiss friends ' house from 1493 this spring . 
  first school shooting was in germany in 1913 !,
