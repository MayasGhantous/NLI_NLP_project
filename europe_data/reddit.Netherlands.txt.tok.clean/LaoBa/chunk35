  even if you get european citizenship , your chances to get an air force job are slim . 
  selection for people who handle very expensive lethal tech is thorough and intense . 
  spain has a foreign legion too although they mainly accept people from spanish-speaking countries . 
  long distance buses like [ eurolines ] ( https://www.eurolines.de/en/international-bus-lines/our-route-map/ ) can be a very cheap way of long distance transportation between cities . 
  couchsurfing is a great way to meet locals and sleep for little money . 
   what should i expect ? 
  unanswerable . 
   places i should go ? 
  while all of the well-known touristic places have lots of attractions , there are plenty of lesser-known places worth visiting that are a bit less filled with tourists . 
  discovering `` untouched '' places in summer when lots of europeans and visitors from outside the continent have vacation will be difficult . 
  i 'm from the netherlands so if you intend to visit here i have plenty of suggestions . 
  the czech republic and slovakia are beautiful , * full * of castles and palaces and almost every town has a historic center because it was spared most destruction in ww2 . 
  also very affordable food and beer as long as you avoid prague . 
   airbnb is not very popular here it is very popular with tourists in places like amsterdam or berlin , which is the reason it causes a lot of problems . 
   we are idiots , mostly found in france as opposed to the netherlands ? 
  those brexit supporters are getting out of hand . 
  note that `` sitzpinkler '' means wuss in german . 
  roquefort is the best cheese ever and when i see it i want it . 
  note : do n't use pound sterling only as a currency in a survey intended for all of europe . 
  kalles kaviar is not expensive and pretty tasty ( it 's cod roe ) . 
  that 's india . 
  reizigers/woonwagenbewoners are ethnically dutch but definitely not elite . 
  yes , i had four barbecue parties last month , one [ on baord of a sailing ship ] ( https://www.waterproof-events.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/blog-zeilen-05.jpg ) ( not my picture but it was on [ this ship ] ( http://www.egelantier.nl/ ) ), 
  [ koreans barbecueing on frozen river ] ( http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/7b4dfc1890ea446e9eedd6b2ee4452e9/south-koreans-barbeque-their-catches-on-a-frozen-river-during-the-fp9wtb.jpg ) . 
  maybe ask / r/italy and / r/germany ? 
  my dutch advice is probably not going to be helpful . 
  anyway , studying abroad is usually a fantastic experience ( it was for me ) so have fun !, 
  main themes from the [ canon of dutch history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canon_of_dutch_history ) which is a guideline for history in schools : * the dutch east india company 1602 - 1799 ( exploration , trade , but also conquest ) * slavery 1637 - 1863 ( the dutch slave trade and use of slaves in the carribean and surinam ) * max havelaar 1860 ( 19th cetrury colonialism and first protests against the treatment of colonial subjects ) * indonesia 1945 - 1949 ( indonesian war of independence ) * suriname and the netherlands antilles from 1945 ( decolonization in dutch antilles and dutch america ) as you can see , this is not exactly a `` we were the good guys '' curriculum . 
  that being said , most people without a colonial background in the netherlands know almost nothing about the history of dutch colonies or how people there were treated and governed . 
  this is the main church in my town [ playing music ] ( http://www.carillontorens.com/muziek/rejoicegreatlyodaughterofzion.mp3 ) : `` rejoice greatly , o daughter of zion '' from handel 's messiah . 
  i think it sounds every fifteen minutes for the time 1,2,3 strokes and the hour number on the whole hour . 
  and on sunday . 
  a concert is played every two weeks on wednesday . 
  the largest bell is from 1542 , but only came to our town in 1953 , to replace the medieval bells stolen and melted by the german occupiers . 
  [ charles huber , germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_m._huber ), 
   i only remember hearing opinions that brexit could lead to further disintegration it 's been a week , uncertainty everywhere and no-one in the uk stepping up to lay out a clear plan . 
  things could be very different in a couple of years ( either way ) . 
   i never realized did n't happen else where . 
  not really in europe , but pretty common in india and brazil . 
   a life size noah 's ark : [ a dutch guy build one and is now touring the world with it to spread the gospel ] ( http://arkofnoah.org/our-story/ )  only surrealist culture . 
  lourdes ? 
  the romanian parliament ? 
  pretty surrealistic places . 
  china : 1,446 ????????? 
  wikipedia says 152,000 -- 183,000 according to chinese sources , western estimate is much higher . 
  oh , and netherlands : 220 . 
  i think `` uk vetoing everything '' is very much an euromyth . 
  i hope that he makes a total ass of himself . 
  for the uk 's sake , i hope he does n't speech too much . 
  uhm , the question was about the eu . 
  the only think i miss are our beautiful banknotes . 
   driving lessons are not a legal requirement . 
  no , but you can not practice on your own . 
  i do n't hate turkish people at all . 
  but turkey has a very bad record of democracy and human rights and seeing what is happening right now i do n't see a fast way for them to join the eu . 
  in countries like the netherlands , all schools that satisfy educational requirements are government funded , this includes many christian and a few jewish and muslim schools , as well as many schools that follow special educational philosophies ( anthroposophic , montessori , dalton , jenaplan , etc ) . 
  all are free . 
  private schools are * very * rare here , mostly international schools for expat children . 
  italy basically invented the modern scooter . 
  the netherlands , ca n't speak for other eu countries :  are the lessons optional or required ? 
  required  what do these lessons entail in your country ? 
  learning to drive a stick-shift car in traffic and on the highway , parking , practical knowledge of traffic rules . 
   is there any way to skip the lessons requirement for people who already know how to drive if you already have a foreign driving licence you can get a dutch one if you are resident here . 
   how many people get drivers licences in your country ? 
  90 % of the people between 25 and 64 years old have a driving licence . 
   if you have a license in one country in the european union are you allowed to drive in other countries with it or only the country you got the license in ? 
  dutch driving licenses are valid all eu countries and in many countries outside the eu . 
  a driving license remains valid if you move to another eu country . 
   holland [ this has n't been forgotten ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8h0crqkmvu ) . 
  well of course we have our own wannabe putin who is a big fan ... 
  i wish britain the best but i hope the netherlands stays in the eu . 
  we do n't really have us bases , except for the nato command center and a storage for tactical nukes that is really controversial .

  the were quite a lot of americans working at afcent in brunssum , some lived in our neighborhood ( you could recognize their special car plates ) but i ca n't remember any interaction . 
  in the part of the netherlands where i grew up , hollendjers ( hollanders ) was specifically used for people from outside our province . 
  yea , i mean the netherlands originated in the spot where south america is now . 
  ( not a joke ), 
   german or dutch dutch and german are n't the same language !, 
  i know that pennsylvanian dutch is a german dialect , , but do n't confuse them in europe !, 
  german is spoken by about 100 million people in the eu and switzerland , but dutch/flemish is spoken only by 21 million . 
  german is a national language of germany and austria ( and belgium , denmark and italy , but they do n't have many native german speakers ) dutch is a national language of the netherlands and belgium only . 
  starting out , it is not a necessity . 
  but if you want to find `` a place of belonging '' learning the local language is a must . 
  thanks for writing this . 
  it is so easy to say : `` discrimination in the netherlands , oh no , we 're not like that ! '', 
  when you are n't polish , asian , antillean , muslim or whatever . 
  probably not . 
  in the netherlands , we are lucky if games ( except for those aimed at small kids ) have dutch subtitles , dubbng is rare . 
  the longest journey had an excellent dutch dub . 
  most gamers play entirely in english  do countries from the eu have video games that never leave their country for wider export ? 
  no , unless you are talking very small flash games . 
  game design studios in the netherlands aim for the worldwide market and produce in english . 
  [ reeperbahn simulator ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vqe-cgiiee ) . 
  run your own porn cinema/stripper club . 
  there 's also the competing rotlicht simulator . 
  note : these are german so basically very thorough business simulators . 
  the fun thing is , there is no standard really . 
  what is the standard ? 
  texas ? 
  california ?
