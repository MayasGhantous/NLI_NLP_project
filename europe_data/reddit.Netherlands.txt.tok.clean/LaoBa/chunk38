  we have the stereotypical moroccan , suriname and indo accents . 
  lots of regional dialects , and some accents which some are clearly associated with class ( hagenees vs haags for example ) . 
  it is n't banned but [ has almost completely disappeared . 
   what about names of other top nazis ? 
  hermann , heinrich , joseph , martin and reinhard are not names that people associate with the nazi 's . 
  in the netherlands too . 
  * vla ( vanille , chocolade , hopjes , caramel , blanke , rabarber , oranje , advocaat , bolletjes , aardbeien ) * stoofpeertjes * griesmeelpudding met bessensaus * haagse bluf * rabarbermoes * spekkoek * rijstebrij * krentjebrij * karnemelkse pap and of course we have lots of cakes that make fine desserts too . 
  swiss cheese is great but lacks the enormous range of french cheeses . 
  the dutch and uk marines too . 
  yes , it 's not that hard . 
   not many brits have worked out in europe [ there are about 2.2 million uk expats in europe . 
  ] ( https://www.expatnetwork.com/expats-concerned-about-the-uk-leaving-the-eu/ ) 400,000 are pensioners so the rest can be assumed to work or study . 
  this is solid advice . 
  both cold cereals and warm porridge are sold in all supermarkets , but bread is the most common breakfast . 
  i lived in switzerland ( z\u00fcrich ) for six years and had a great time , i did speak german when i arrived and it took me a couple of months to understand z\u00fcrit\u00fc\u00fctsch ( local swiss german dialect ) . 
   i know a few folks who have worked there speaking almost only english if you want to integrate in switzerland you absolutely need to speak the local language . 
  just english is n't going to cut it . 
   i heard some countries are very closed to immigrants while others are more open . 
  it is almost impossible to generalize because it will depend so much on you mentality , your looks , your interests , your job and your locations ( and sometimes just on luck ) whether you 'll integrate successfully . 
   no bases here no , but there sure are americans at [ allied joint force command brunssum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_joint_force_command_brunssum ), 
  the one where we are a member is a mix of people offering their cars ( sometimes at all times , sometimes only in weekends or evenings ) and cars that belong to the carshare company . 
  if we need a car we can set the time on the website and it shows all available cars in the neighborhood . 
  if they are private cars we pick up the keys from the owner , if they belong to the carshare company we can open them using a chip card . 
  you pay for both distance and time you rent . 
  we walk or use a bike to pick up the cars . 
  the main disadvantage is that you have to estimate how long you need the car before reserving one . 
  it works well for us . 
  we use cars between 2 and 6 times per month , depending on the circumstances . 
  i use my bike , the train and the bus to go to work ( about 80 minutes one way ) . 
  my wife and kids go to work , school and university by bike ( 5 , 10 and 40 minutes one way ) . 
  we do n't own a car but are members of a car-share company so we can pick up a car when we need one . 
  my wife used one yesterday to pick up a sewing machine in another city . 
  when we go on vacation we rent a car when we do n't fly , for city trips we tend to use the train , we went to z\u00fcrich last weekend using night trains . 
  sloep of course !, 
  i see rabbits almost weekly in the uithof ( university complex ) in utrecht , toads and frogs are pretty common in my town garden . 
  hedgehogs are n't uncommon either . 
  i 've seen squirrels , roe deer , hares , and a fox while cycling to the station . 
  and a wild boar while taking a bus to work ( but this was in a forested area ) . 
  and [ this was filmed in my hometown but i have n't seen one yet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pydnvvf6ft4 ) . 
  birds are mainly blackbirds , starlings , sparrows and doves , but also jays ( very pretty ) and treecreepers . 
  there are also grey herons and storks as soon as you leave town , there is a stork nest that is usually occupied in the neighborhood . 
  and on summer evenings we get bats in the garden . 
  the medical one is the expensive one , we pay about 180 euro per month i think ( my adult dauther pays her own ) . 
  the others are all quite affordable , maybe 50 euros per month all in all excepting the life insurance which is more a kind of old-age pension saving . 
  this is a very rough estimate that might be off by a factor of 2 !, 
  note that we have no car so no car insurance . 
  this is what i have as a homeowner with a four-person household : * medical insurance ( obligatory ) * home insurance ( fire/floods/etc , obligatory to get a mortgage ) * household insurance ( contents of the house , fire/burglary etc ) * life insurance * personal liability * continuous travel insurance * legal assitance insurance, 
  winx club is italian animation that is highly successful , it has been aired in 130 counties !, 
  we have little local animation , but : [ alfred jodocus kwak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqepbinw5q0 ) : dutch but animated in the netehrlans , germany , finland , japan and spain . 
  the director was japanese but the stories and songs were written by dutch actor/singer/author herman van veen .

  [ purno the purno : in the cave of the tickler ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o6mij7iq1u ) ( nsfw in anglo-saxon counties ) and this is what publicly funded children 's tv showed in 1990 . 
  you have been warned , this stuff is seriously weird and made on an amiga 2000 . 
  some of the installments are 18 + on youtube . 
  [ the white cowboy ] ( http://www.whitecowboy.nl/ ) , a more innocent children 's series . 
  note however that the netherlands have much more forest now than 100 years ago . 
   10.8 % -- or about 365,000 hectares -- of netherlands is forested . 
  of this , none is classified as primary forest , the most biodiverse form of forest . 
   change in forest cover : between 1990 and 2000 , netherlands gained an average of 1,500 hectares of forest per year . 
  the amounts to an average annual reforestation rate of 0.43 % . 
  between 2000 and 2005 , the rate of forest change decreased by 36.1 % to 0.28 % per annum . 
  in total , between 1990 and 2005 , netherlands gained 5.8 % of its forest cover , or around 20,000 hectares . 
  measuring the total rate of habitat conversion ( defined as change in forest area plus change in woodland area minus net plantation expansion ) for the 1990-2005 interval , netherlands gained 5.9 % of its forest and woodland habitat . 
   then , there was the issue of some initiators accused of hijacking the opportunity of a referendum to turn it in a vote against the eu itself . 
   of course we do n't care about ukraine , you have to understand that . 
  a nexit ( * netherlands leaving the eu * ) referendum is n't possible yet ( * because of how the dutch referendum law works * ) . 
  so we 'll use any opportunity to worsen the relation between the netherlands and the eu . '', 
  house construction in the us and europe is very different . 
   only major european country spain is n't a major country ? 
  or sweden ( they used to invade germany all the time , not the other way round ) . 
  as a kid , long time ago : stimorol and bazooka . 
  from a linguistic viewpoint , yes . 
  but the people who emphasise hoe `` germanic '' the netherlands are are more about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_germanic_reich ) . 
  if you really want to scare the dutch away call it the germanic union . 
  this brings up * very * bad memories . 
  / u/schwertritter is bullshitting you . 
  he owns the castle himself . 
  i knew it !, 
  also piss off the belgians and french with weed smell and the germans with our oversize bicycle trailer parked in the corridor . 
  and all the others by bringing the absolute minimum to pot-luck parties . 
  i was phoned once by my bank because they flagged a transaction , which was indeed fraudulent , and send me a new card . 
  there are jehova 's witnesses at the two stations a frequent everyday , but they do n't aproach people , they just have glossy folders you can take . 
  i can live with that . 
  i lived in switzerland and that was great , also would n't mind germany or belgium i guess . 
  ghirardelli 's is good chocolate . 
   i think the problem is that in the us everything has high fructose corn syrup corn syrup is used in far more products in europe than you would think , check the ingredient lists . 
  16 , 23 , or 24 , depending on what counts as a visit or country :-) i 'm from the netherlands actually visited : * norway ( three weeks vacation ) * uk ( honeymoon in wales , vacations in england and scotland ) * germany ( very often visited , several vacations ) * belgium ( very often visited , vacations and long weekend ) * luxembourg ( two weeks vacation ) * france ( many vacations , almost yearly as a kid ) * italy ( two vacations , sud-tirol and rome ) * spain ( city trip to barcelona ) * vatican city ( took a tour ) * switzerland ( several vacations and lived there for years , going again next week ! ), 
  * greece ( vacation to athens ) * czech republic ( two vacations and city trip to prague ) * hungary ( university excursion of one week ) * russia ( took the train from beijing to the netherlands and had a day to look around moscow ) * malta ( two weeks vacation ) technically also visited : * denmark ( crossed by bus and train ) * sweden ( crossed by bus ) * poland ( crossed by train and stepped into poland for ten minutes in the karkonosze ) * portugal ( switched planes in faro ) * white russia ( crossed by train ) * austria ( crossed by train and had wiener schnitzel at the bahnhof ) * liechtenstein ( made a short hike there as a kid ) european country that does n't exist anymore : * ddr, 
  look at mr. 
  fancy there with his baron . 
  our landlord is n't even titled and we are only allowed to stay in his pig-sty in leap years . 
  it is a pity that cycling is mostly seen as a thing for upward-mobile professionals or students in the us because i think many poor people could profit immensely from using bicycles in the us . 
   zoning does not exist in europe as it does in the us in the netherlands we have cities that are much newer than almost any us city , it 's just that creating suburbs without any services is not a thing here because people want to be within cycling distance from stores and schools if possible . 
  almere is the 7th largest city in the netherlands and the first house was build in 1976 . 
   considering so many europeans do n't own a car actually , [ west europeans own more cars per capita than americans !, 
  ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/08/its-official-western-europeans-have-more-cars-per-person-than-americans/261108/ )  new urbanists and other advocates of walkable urbanism act like coffee shops and microbreweries are more important than grocery stores lol . 
  if you view `` walkable cities '' as a playground for highly educated 20 and 30 year olds , this is the way to go . 
  but if you want all ages and economic classes on board , then you have to take the wishes and needs of everybody into account .
