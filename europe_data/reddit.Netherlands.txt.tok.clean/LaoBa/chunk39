  here is my situation from the netherlands . 
  i 'm a middle-aged professional with a working spouse and two teen-aged children . 
  we live in a progressive town with 38,000 inhabitants and have no car , which is pretty rare if i look at my friends and colleagues . 
  we use car-sharing when we need a car . 
  we get our groceries by bike . 
  our bikes have large bags , and my wifes has a carrier in front too . 
  i usually use a backpack . 
  like in most dutch towns and cities , there are several small and mid-sized supermarkets within a one-mile range , both traditional supermarkets and limited assortment discounters like lidl and aldi . 
  we have markets on wednesday ( morning only ) and saturday ( until four in the afternoon ) which we tend to visit all the time . 
  we shop about every two days , and combine visiting the market with supermarket visits . 
  we do n't have a medieval square ( it was shot to pieces in 1940 ) but like almost every town a car-free center and our market square with a church in the middle and lined with cafes looks quite nice . 
  we buy fresh produce , cheese , poultry , meat , eggs , nuts , spices and bread at the market , as well as flowers . 
  fresh fired fish and freshly made stroopwafels or poffertjes are things you can only eat at the market here , so we sometimes do . 
  we have a university so we have a lot of students and the market is definitily not for old people only . 
  one of the reasons that there are almost no hypermarkets in the netherlands is that zoning is very strict here and municipalities are n't keen on them because it will `` suck the life out of the city '' . 
  original it was a general name for wine or malt distillates ( `` burned wine '' ) , sometimes flavored , but modern brandewijn is made of distilled and charcoal filtered alcohol with little taste apart form the alcohol , it is pretty close to vodka although the different brands have a different taste . 
  dutch brandewijn comes very close . 
  it 's an acquired taste . 
  nobody gives a shit about being an atheist here . 
  nobody asks politicians what church they actually frequent . 
  not such a strict separation of church and state . 
  so the government can support all schools , religious and non-religious ones . 
  nobody calls the aclu over a nativity scene at school around christmas . 
  god in our national anthem . 
  most people who refuse to vaccinate their kids do so for religious reasons . 
  religious parties in parliament and as part of the government . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lszpnwzex9s&amp;feature=youtu.be ) . 
  they definitely have a certain `` cool '' factor here . 
  i lived in zurich and love [ this promotional video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4w-jvts7l8 ) , it captures the spirit of the city . 
  personally : on my fathers side it starts with a guy who moved from altona to the netherlands around 1800 , on my mothers side we have a family tree back to about 1600 ( a cousin of my mom checked this all out ) . 
  my uncle is a descendant of theo van gogh ( 1857-1891 , vincent van gogh 's brother ) and of french naval hero abraham duquesne ( 1610-1688 ) . 
  trains with wifi . 
   be fleeing in droves to countries like poland that 's pretty funny ( no offense meant ) . 
  my country is n't portrayed in the media except that we are mourning johan cruijff right now . 
  also , i do n't give a shit . 
  ten years ago we were portrayed some super-progressive lalaland or a place of utter decadence where we euthanize our grannies for fun . 
  a german comes into a well-stocked dutch arms shop . 
  `` i would like to buy a handgun . '', 
  `` we do n't have handguns , sir . '', 
  the german looks at the racks full of handguns and asks : `` i would like to buy a rifle , then . '', 
  `` we do n't have rifles either , sir . '', 
  `` well , can you at least sell me a knife ?! '', 
  `` we do n't have those either . '', 
  the german is very annoyed by now and shouts `` do you have something against germans ? '', 
  `` yes , rifles , handguns and knives . '', 
  unpleasant things happen to germans in dutch jokes ... 
  nah , in dutch jokes , belgians are stupid and inordinately fond of fries , in belgian jokes , the dutch are stingy and dirty ( as they save on soap ) . 
  who invented the copper thread ? 
  two dutch fighting over a quarter . 
  how were the caves of han formed ? 
  a dutchman once lost a cent there . 
  how can you see you crossed the dutch border ? 
  from the toilet paper drying on the washing lines . 
  what do the strips on belgian police uniforms mean ? 
  three : he can read and write . 
  two : he can read . 
  one : he knows a guy who can read . 
  dutch restaurants do n't have to serve tap water by law , [ source in dutch ] ( https://www.krnwtr.nl/de-horeca-is-niet-verplicht-kraanwater-te-serveren/ ) and since it is n't traditional to do so here it is fully up to the restaurant owner to decide how this is handled . 
  [ republican candidates on the use of torture ( waterboarding )  ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/donald-trump-waterboarding-republican-debate-torture ) donald trump said he would `` bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding '' , or simulated drowning . 
  ted cruz , `` it is enhanced interrogation ... 
  it does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture . 
  i would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use . 
  and indeed i 'd join with senator [ john ] mccain in prohibiting line officers from employing it . '' former florida governor jeb bush : `` it was used sparingly , congress has changed the laws and i think where we stand is the appropriate place . '' meanwhile , marco rubio said it was inappropriate to discuss interrogation techniques . 
   so any nazi level stuff would never happen , because we 'd say `` fuck you '' to any weird stuff a politician would say . 
  i do n't see any `` fuck you '' to this stuff . 
  i 've worked in switzerland and the us ( hawaii ) as an agricultural researcher . 
  working abroad for a while and getting to know a foreign culture is a great experience . 
  british humor is n't what it used to be . 
  i lived in switzerland for years so i 'll answer as i experienced it from living in zurich :  do you feel more affinity with , e.g. , germany than with french swiss ? 
  the french speaking swiss are the most cross-border oriented , but they still identify way more with fellow swiss with another language . 
   if someone asked where you are from , would you simply say ` switzerland ' or would you immediately specify the region ? 
  abroad , switzerland , inside switzerland , city ( or canton ) . 
   if your head of state was from a different region would you worry that he/she would be biased ? 
  the swiss do n't have a head of state . 
  [ the seven members of the federal council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_federal_council ) are equal in power and are always selected to represent the diversity of languages . 
  ( four german , two french , one italian or romansh . 
  there is a president but he or she is simply one of the seven who will be the chairperson for a year . 
  the swiss political system works with extensive official and informal quotas to achieve a fair representation . 
   do you often travel to the other parts of the country ? 
  yes . 
   is it difficult to do business with other regions ? 
  laws can differ between cantons , but in general , no . 
   what , besides language , would you say is the major difference between regions ? 
  food , politics , climate , religion . 
  note that [ cycling in venice proper is not allowed ] ( http://www.visit-venice-italy.com/travel-getting-to-venice-bicycle.htm ) . 
  [ there is n't real bike sharing in the netherlands . 
  ] ( https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/bike-share-the-dutch-way/ ) but renting bikes is easy in amsterdam . 
  yodeling has come a long way . 
  [ s liechtli by christine lauterburg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rxykzd-9kw ) if this does n't convince you of swiss culture , maybe sophie hunger 's [ walzer f\u00fcr niemand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acs9ngtq6e4 ) ( waltz for nobody ), 
  if you know anything about the swiss , asking this on / r/askeurope is a mistake . 
  the dutch make you speechless ? 
   ze germans took our bicycles and refuse to give them back . 
  they also invade our beaches every summer , digging holes in the sand everywhere . 
  but they are our friends now . 
  the colonial past is very close to me as both of my parents were born in dutch colonies which were still colonies at the time and my grandfathers both worked for the colonial government , one as governor of the [ sss-islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sss_islands ) , the other as head engineer of municipal electricity in indonesia . 
  in a way the colonial history runs on in my genes , as my grandmother was half-black ( from suriname ) . 
  my mother left the antilles at a young age but i grew up reading and learning a lot about colonial indonesia . 
  what strikes me is how remote the dutch colonial population was from the indonesian population . 
  it really was an apartheid system , with indonesians being excluded from many functions , privileges and educational possibilities . 
  i fully understand that indonesia wanted to be independent after the war , before the war any political aspirations by indonesians had been harshly repressed .
