  anyway , they think it is a beautiful tropical island with beaches , sun and pretty people . 
  i lived in manoa valley and kaimuki so i 'm a bit more informed . 
  liked it there !, 
  no they do n't . 
  average age of first marriage is 33 for males and 30 for females , which is pretty normal for the eu . 
  you must understand that people from other european countries are already quite common for a long time , i grew up in a mining area and 50 years ago there were polish , italian and moroccan miners . 
  we never had anything like racial segregation ( well except for during the nazi occupation ) so there were always opportunities for integrating . 
  and as others remarked , the ec/eu has grown slowly , there was no sudden `` now we are eu '' day where everything changed . 
  the introduction of the euro was maybe the greatest change in daily life for most people here . 
  because of the benelux the border to belgium has been open since i was born but i remember the border controls at the german border , we were glad when those disappeared . 
  older generation : van kooten en de bie . 
  debiteuren/crediteuren was made by jiskefet . 
  our national kitchen is more influenced by indonesian food . 
  come on , we have our own forms of stupidity . 
  they are not as common but [ sailing camps are popular ] ( http://www.wvwillemstad.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sdc18509.jpg ) , i also did a camp for a month in france when i was 12 , my wife did some summer camps in drente and the west frisian islands as a kid and my own children have been to sailing camps too . 
  we have plenty of open water . 
  summer camps here tend to be one or two weeks because most parents want to do 2-3 weeks summer vacation with their kids . 
  i do n't see why you need an isolated area for a summer camp ? 
  good vla is never overly sweet , you probably are used to the [ questionable factory made stuff ] ( http://www.bakkerbart.nl/media/vlaaien/bananenkrokantvlaai-vrij2013.jpg/?h=2000&amp;q=80&amp;r=1&amp;w=474 ) instead of the [ original ] ( http://bakkerijhannen.nl/new/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/assortie-vlaai.jpg ) made in a limburg bakery . 
  netherlands : [ gilles de geus ] ( https://www.bobbedoes.nl/_items/a950b1ae-7cbb-4d8b-8bbe-cf2caaa7540b/1.jpg ) ( about a highwayman/freedom fighter during the dutch revolt , extremely funny ) by hanco kolk and peter de wit or [ meccano ] ( https://www.bobbedoes.nl/_items/964c551e-46c7-4c4c-9b6a-dc775ac094b5/4.jpg ) ( stories about the decadence and alienation of modern life set in a fictional mediterranean country ) by hanco kolk . 
  for more action , [ franka ] ( https://s.s-bol.com/imgbase0/imagebase3/extralarge/fc/1/2/7/7/9200000020597721.jpg ) about a female private eye . 
  taiwan : good but discrete relations , second-largest trade partner of taiwan in eu . 
  new york : those upstarts mostly forgot the motherland !, 
  south africa : most ties were cut during the apartheid regime . 
  berbice : all have forgotten it was dutch . 
  dutch brazil : apparently they still eat stamppot . 
  yes , same here . 
  religion , the north is protestant and the south catholic . 
  also relation with the government , the north has had a lot of local autonomy since the middle ages ( one of the reasons why the broke away from the spanish/habsburg empire ) , the south was under northern rule for a long time . 
  also the south has much better food !, 
  no , no , non , [ ** this ** was wageningen station ] ( http://www.teammitropa.nl/uploads/27a1aaf2485ea6a389a060cf8d6c4cb2.jpg ) , now long gone , although we still have a stationsstraat . 
  z\u00fcrich is pretty nice to live but housing is incredibly expensive . 
  maastricht is wonderful . 
  nice size , pretty old city center , close to belgium and germany , great food . 
  yes , i like both military and general history , and historical fiction . 
  i read a lot of wikipedia articles too . 
  wageningen : no railway station . 
  davis , california . 
  both have people from all over the world in a relatively small student town , lots of bicycles and bicycle paths , an arboretum and botanical garden , farmers market on wednesday and saturday , alternative students housing in the green with chickens and stuff that the inhabitants have fought for to keep and our agricultural universities are number one and two in the world in most rankings . 
  but they have a railway station and we do n't , shameful for a dutch town . 
  i rarely ask as a refusal often offends . 
   we were never really good in marine stuff [ well that one time ] ( https://www.uow.edu.au/~morgan/graphics/lissa27.jpg ) when you crushed the italians ... also i really enjoy the [ otto prohaska ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1354187.a_sailor_of_austria ) novels about the austrian navy . 
  it would have been more accurate to separate zuid en midden-limburg from brabant en noord-limburg , groningen from friesland , etc , etc , but i was too lazy to do that . 
  as someone who grew up in geleen i do know the culture is definitely special . 
  as marie-jacqueline mentions , it is all very generalized and a much more accurate division in cultural regions could be made , but i 'm too lazy to do that . 
   that sounds amazing you guys own your own boats . 
  small ones , more like [ this ] ( http://www.marinarijnsburg.nl/inhoud/uploads/2015/02/sloep-slaap-rijnsburg.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://www.hoogenboomkaag.nl/uploads/images/dsc02580.jpg ) then like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itcddrocchw ) :-) rentals are also very popular . 
  there are also a lot of beautiful [ flat-bottomed historic ships ] ( http://www.bruinevlootspakenburg.nl/application/files/7114/3530/9879/bruinevloot6.jpg ) . 
  they are used for [ racing ] ( http://images0.tcdn.nl/binnenland/article24328059.ece/binary/original/sk%c3%bbtsjesilen.jpg ) , [ excursions ] ( https://zeilvlootmuiden.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/zeilvloot-muiden-banner-volharding.jpg ) and as [ private yachts ] ( http://www.franekercourant.nl/files/2015/05/ffc-koning-in-harlingen-foto-nick-den-boer4.jpg ) . 
   vlaai looks absolutely delicious !, 
  it is , although you can buy it everywhere in the country these days i really miss the quality it has in limburg , most of the vlaai sold elsewhere is mass-produced . 
   i 'm curious what carton means ? 
  straw-board , the stuff used to make brown boxes . 
  these is only one nederlandplein ( netherlands square ) in the netherlands , in eindhoven . 
  i really enjoy swimming in open water including rivers , but unfortunately it 's not always easy to find out if it is safe .

  visiting foreign cities with my so . 
  barcelona , prague , lille , paris , venice , z\u00fcrich , athens . 
  it 's the rhine river , and although the little beaches look placid , the stream is strong , especially around [ these things ] ( https://beeldbank.rws.nl/ruimtevoorderivier/home/displaydetail/404238 ) which can cause an invisible and dangerous undertow , also there are [ large and fast cargo ships ] ( https://indebuurt.nl/arnhem/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/anp-1017547.jpg ) which can not see swimmers and can cause mini-tsunami 's on the beach . 
  a couple of people drown at such beaches every year while swimming in the rivers . 
  we are all still guessing . 
  mandatory bicycle helmets are sign of underdeveloped bicycle infrastructure . 
  and most important , the western part is arrogant and knows nothing about the rest of the country . 
  [ hutspot ] ( http://www.budgetgerecht.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hutspot.jpg ) : mashed potatoes and carrots . 
  i like most traditional and modern dutch mashed potato dishes ( stamppot boerenkool , stamppot zuurkool , stamppot andijvie , stamppot rucola met oude kaas ) , but the one with carrots has a bland , unpleasant taste . 
  you can get stuff like that in western europe too . 
  it 's [ a specialty of lille ] ( http://www.foodreporter.fr/upload/original/4/y/b/s/x/158052.jpg ) ( potjevleesch ), 
  [ here ] ( http://www.best2be.nl/nl/imagehandler.ashx?uploadedfile=true&amp;pg=%7b0%7d&amp;image=/nl/app_data/userimages/image/rijn%20strand.jpg ) , but though it looks nice , it is a dangerous place to swim . 
  joking aside , the partners of previous prime ministers stayed very much out of the limelight , they have no public functions and are not part of election campaigns . 
  within temptation, 
  yes , we have a [ local mission ] ( http://www.ijssaloncicuto.nl/ ), 
   longer vowels than other regions limburgs has some very long vowels , just get a [ tuuuuuuuuuuuut chips with that coke . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/dw_buebihj0?t=72 ), 
  2017 election had some rather peculiar parties , but `` joke `` parties are not accepted . 
  * niet stemmers ( non voters party ) their only campaign promise was that they would n't vote in parliament when elected . 
  * stemnl ( vote nl ) : they did n't have a program but promised referendums on everything all the time and a voting app . 
  it works in dutch too !, 
  they are called * eindexamen * ( final exams ) in dutch . 
  it is the terrorist angle which makes this continental news . 
  attacks on police are n't that common , but of course they do happen . 
  because they are usually only in local language news , they will not spread as widely , especially as usually neither police nor assailant are killed . 
  plans to deal with climate change [ fierljeppen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtf_zj0s9s0 ), 
  yes . 
  had some great indian food there :-), 
  although we have over 100 nationalities in my town , it 's not really touristic . 
  [ they love dogs in switzerland ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/not-just-christmas-swiss-urged-stop-eating-cats-and-dogs-287378 ), 
  except italian will be more useful in li\u00e8ge than in gen\u00e8ve although it is an official language in switzerland . 
  ede is the happiest town in the netherlands . 
  incredible . 
  there are about 25.000 german students in the netherlands and many of them do bachelors and masters in the dutch language . 
  the closeness of the dutch and german languages helps a lot . 
  there are also flemish , surinamese and south african students who study in dutch , but more and more studies , especially masters , are offered in english . 
  there are 90.000 foreign students in the netherlands . 
  after germans , chinese make up the largest group . 
  good one !, 
  wonderful !, 
  also great for cooking ( you can use the cheaper ones for that ),
