  there was a large ( communist inspired ) uprising in 1926 that no-one in the netherlands remembers which lead to 13,000 indonesians being arrested . 
  for all the time that the netehrlands has been in indonesia , i think the countries have influenced each other relatively little . 
  well , i made nasi goreng with sayur lodeh and sambal tempeh goreng for dinner today . 
  i have only visited aruba , but i would certainly like to visit indonesia . 
  the house in which my father grew up ( which was designed by his uncle , an architect ) is still standing . 
  the swiss are only united on the outside , the rules between the cantons are in some cases stricter than between schengen country . 
  swiss need residence permits for other cantons in some cases . 
  it is n't as if there were any british , commonwealth or colonies fighting the japanese . 
  / s frankly , i 'm pretty amazed . 
  is this some hidden trauma ? 
  my aunt visits schools to tell about her experiences in the japanese camps where both of my grandparents died . 
  i used to live in swizerland and take the train to the netherlands for weekends home , even though it was a sleeper it was pretty affordable . 
  i also did beijing , china to ede-wageningen , the netherlands entirely by train for something like $ 360 but that was a * long * time ago !, 
  behind higher flood defenses . 
  we get weekly updates in the newspapers and a spread about super tuesday recently . 
  apart from some people calling trump a clown , politicians here are n't really voicing their opinions on candidates . 
  personally i 'd prefer a democrat over a republican but i do n't think any outcome would have a dramatic impact on my life . 
  the mediterranean countries , especially spain , have serious wildfires almost yearly . 
  france , spain , greece , turkey and italy all maintain units of water bombers . 
  i 'm from the netherlands and small wildfires are a problem here in summer but as we are a densely populated country with lots of roads they are detected soon and firefighters can get equipment on the spot very quickly . 
  also we build whole new parts of our country ( or other people 's countries ) on a regular base . 
  need more space ? 
  we can build it ! ^ * * only coastal countries need apply . 
  unless you have a bunch of lakes you 're not using . 
  the netherlands : visit the [ wadden islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_frisian_islands ) , they 're beautiful , great places for cycling and enjoying the beach . 
  go [ wadlopen ] ( http://www.wadlopen.net/english/englis-home ) in the wadden sea !, 
  visit the largest north sea harbor and [ make a tour ] ( http://spido.nl/en ) in rotterdam . 
  enjoy the beach life in [ scheveingen ] ( http://www.scheveningenbeach.com/ ) . 
  visit the [ massive flood defences ] ( http://www.deltawerken.com/the-deltaworks-visitor-centres-/366.html ) and beautiful beaches of zeeland . 
   many of the stations this happened in did n't even have any stairs . 
  this sounds almost like vimes talking in a terry pratchett book . 
  we also have '' [ boterham met tevredenheid ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/boterham_0205.jpg/250px-boterham_0205.jpg ) '' ( sandwich with contentment ), 
  `` klein broodje boterham '' , little little bread sandwich . 
  * i love our language , you can express yourself wonderfully and it can be a great singing language . 
  english has a certain `` cool '' factor and that 's why lots of commercials are in english and many of our artists sing in english . 
  * i love our dialects and the rich heritage of our language that can be found in languages all over the world . 
  and do n't think you can just speak dutch for privacy abroad without being understood , there are more dutch speakers than you think . 
  * wonderful dutch : [ ben ali libi , a poem by willem wilmink ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6wfs1gzqo ) [ amsterdam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kas-aiy83d0 ) by kris de bruyne . 
  [ bloedend hart ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adnyfh1p3kk ) by de dijk . 
   for a lack of words compared to english this definitely has to do with your vocabulary , when translating dutch into english you run into the same situation . 
   can those dialects be so different that two speakers ca n't understand each other ? 
  definitely , i 'm from southern limburg and my wife is from noord-oost-groningen and the dialects are * very * different . 
  but everyone in the netherlands can more or less speak `` standard dutch '' ( if sometimes with a heavy accent ) . 
  [ this is how they speak like 25 km from where i grew up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz62tvmht6c ) and i have difficulty understanding it . 
   charlie magazine  outspoken , dictative and vulgar are you aware that anti-clericalism is a centuries old tradition in france ? 
  nothing [ vanilla atheist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-clericalism#/media/file:action_cl%c3%a9ricale.jpg ) about this . 
   swamp germans never heard that name for the english before . 
  we have [ this place ] ( http://www.heksenwaag.nl/web/en/home/?language_id=16 ) where since 1545 you could get a certificate of ** not ** being a witch . 
  witchhunting stopped relatively early in the netherlands ( last witches burned in 1610 ) and we do n't seem to have much of a remaining witchcraft tradition . 
  the [ bokkenrijders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buckriders ) were criminal gangs in limburg that were accused of having made a pact with the devil . 
  houd vol !, 
  well my dad used to call groningen `` paris of the north '' !, 
  netherlands has become much more strict the last 5-10 years , used to be 16 and nobody gave much of a shit , then some stupid teens decided binge drinking/alcohol poisoning was a fun pastime leading to a moral panic . 
  when i grew up our school had a bar where you could go on friday afternoon ( for 16 and up ) to have a beer after school . 
  cool factoid : [ the teutonic order ] ( http://www.rdo.nl/pagina/1 ) still exists as a charity , only protestant male nobles can be members , they still have possesions throughout the country . 
  i could n't think of any european remakes , although they of course exist . 
  you can find some but they are rare . 
  the eiffel tower gets blown up during the three minute `` look , the aliens are striking all over earth '' sequence , after which the action moves back to the us in american movies . 
  fishing is very popular among males and is a typical working class passtime . 
  hunting is mostly an upper class/upper middle class pastime because you need to own/rent a hunting area for your own , and you need quite a lot of courses/qualifications before you 're allowed to hunt . 
  farmers can also hunt on their own land and some do , but many just rent their land to hunters . 
  the bottom line is that the netherlands is very densily populated so there is n't any wilderness and all populations of larger game animals are closely monitored/managed . 
  there is a bit of a poaching tradition among some working class/lower class people . 
  source : one of my friends is the son of a formor royal gamekeeper , and father in law who was a farmer and rented his land to hunters ( open fields so not much game , he usually just got a hare or pheasant in december as payment ) . 
  not many liechtensteiner in the netherlands , welcome !, 
  netherlands is state mandated obligatory health insurance with subsidies for those without money , all insurers have to accept you for basic package which covers most things . 
  you pay 70-90 euro monthly plus 350 euros deductible ( deductible up to 850 euro is possible for lower premium ) . 
   do you find the system to be efficient or overly bureaucratic ? 
  efficient . 
  go to gp unless emergency , gp decides if you need to see specialist , make appointment with specialist usually a month or so if non-urgent . 
   is health care rationing a problem ? 
  not really . 
   are the prescriptions you need available to you ? 
  yes , but we do n't have advertisements for medicines here so we do n't usually expect a certain brand . 
   are they reasonably priced ? 
  prescriptions are covered by insurance . 
   if you had to rate your respective system 1-10 , how would it rank ? 
  8/10 , many commercial insurance providers are starting not to cover all hospitals/medical service providers , makes things needlessly complicated . 
  for your enjoyment : [ f\u00fcssen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfypv2p7isq ) , another beautiful bavarian town . 
   where 's your favorite old time place in europe ? 
  venice blew my mind , absolutely wonderful ( we visited after the main tourist season ) , in my own country maastricht , thorn and bourtange . 
  no , ca n't think of anyone being locked up for that in the netherlands . 
  i mean , you can call muslims pig-fuckers here on public television , something i do n't think the us would allow . 
  many towns have a pretty historic center , but the outer parts are usually newer and less interesting . 
   now are a lot of these in the netherlands ? 
  all of those behind the link . 
  if you are referring to [ this scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjip9dpdyek ) , the town of eindhoven does n't look like that anymore , it 's a rather boring modern place now . 
  lots of modern buildings put up after the war , only a few old streets in the center . 
   uks stalwart attitude retreating when the battle of france was still fully on , which is often not really mentioned when the `` miracle of dunkirk '' is celebrated . 
  [ yes , here are some from the area where band of brothers took place ] ( http://www.mooistedorpjes.nl/landen/nederland/noord-brabant/ ) . 
  if i would n't have seen it on the news i would n't have noticed anything . 
   but people usually panic for a reason . 
  uhm , no . 
   more and more are coming and some are dangerous . 
  it is a problem , but not something that will have a major impact on my life . 
   `` death of white europe . '', 
  these are the same kind of people that thought letting italians and irish emigrate to the us would be the end of the country . 
  this , plenty of racists here in the netherlands but they would n't be posting much in english . 
  [ yes we have ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1vachoftoy ) . 
  you 're probably referring to [ this post ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/458jg9/serious_redditors_in_russia_how_is_donald_trump/czw5mb8 ) .
