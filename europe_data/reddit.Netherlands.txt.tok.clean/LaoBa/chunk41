  in the netherlands it is n't or was n't a touchy subject . 
  we do n't feel slighted or something , but many people were traumatized by the war and lost relatives , myself included . 
  people who were on the wrong side during the war were often shunned for a long time afterwards , and their families too , especially in small communities . 
  calling someone nazi/ss is a grievious insult . 
  dutch car plates still do n't use the combinations ss and sd ( sicherheitsdienst ) !, 
  every year during summer vacation , during the year about once or twice to germany ( it 's close ) and once to belgium . 
  last year we visited france ( twice ) , belgium and greece . 
  what ? 
  what a shame , it is my favorite blue cheese ever . 
  dutch cheeses ( extra belegen , oud , overjarig , geitenkaas , komijnekaas , [ dutch flavoured cheeses ] ( http://ruscellocheese.nl/ruscello-traditional/?lang=en ) , [ beemster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beemster_cheese ) , [ remeker ] ( http://www.remeker.nl/en/ ) , venendaler , boerenkaas , old dutch ) : on sandwiches for breakfast and lunch , in a [ tosti ] ( http://images.smulweb.nl/recepten/1354991/low_res/1_tosti.jpg ) , for gratins , cheese pancakes and cheese omelettes . 
  also some brie , camenbert , blue d'auvergne , danish blue , gruyere , appenzeller or gorgonzola on sandwiches for breakfast or lunch . 
  french , italian , swiss , greek : for french , italian , swiss and greek recipes , and as a snack . 
  i knew about lens but not about lille . 
   oh , and the netherlands of course . 
  is n't les corons one of the anthems of the north ? 
  we used to have a [ super-patriottic/non-pc national anthem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wien_ne%c3%aarlands_bloed ) from 1832 and 1933 full of glowing love for dutch soil , dutch king and dutch blood free of foreign taints . 
  and then there was [ cheeky fun stuff ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/weerbaarhedenlied ) about going to commit rape and genocide on the belgians . 
  but all this was already controversial before the second world war . 
  we do . 
  romanians are the guys and ladies who do programming :-), 
   it used to be that businesses in europe paid higher fees for credit cards , so they did n't like to accept them , they still do , that 's why debit cards are preferred . 
  i rarely use cash , mainly at the market ( although most have card readers ) and to pay people collecting money for charity . 
   the guy you 're handling a cheque to knows that you 'll pay him , i was warned in the us that even if a check cleared this was no guarantee that you could keep te money if it turned out the guy handing out the cheque was insolvent . 
  this is a totally awesome one , i can imagine it echoing through the mountains . 
  dutch : sov yet . 
  avignon is a wonderful and charming town and you can reach it directly by tgv from paris . 
  the netherlands : part-time jobs like distributing newspapers or flyers or working in a supermarket are common . 
  supermarket stocking is almost 100 % a teenagers job ( because they have lower minimum wages ) . 
  working during the summer vacation to earn some money is also not exceptional . 
  kibbeling or kapsalon are really much better . 
  norway was always very expensive . 
  gorgeous country , though . 
  slovenia is supposed to be gorgeous and still a bit of the beaten track , while well developed at the same time . 
  i love it , it is classy , symbolizes unity , does n't hail back to anything that came before . 
  i 'll ask her when i meet her :-) but seriously , most of us have complex opinions on america . 
   fellow americans op is polish . 
  hard work will certainly help to achieve success and promotions , but job security is a bit better here ( you wo n't get fired on a whim ) . 
   does everyone get this at some point ? 
  i think many people , especially in fields where your own initiative is important , does get this at some point , but usually not as strong as you describe . 
  that is something i really like here , we 're a family with two children and we use car-sharing , bicycling and public transportation . 
  our kids were able to cycle/use busses and trains from a young age which gives them a lot of independence and means we parents do n't get to be a taxi company for years . 
  frankly i never think about american football , neither do most of my countrymen . 
  it 's probably like cricket to you , you know it exists and that it is popular in other countries , and that 's it . 
  [ the attempt to make it more popular here was a failure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nfl_europe ), 
  shit , call management . 
  someone found out that europe is just a theme park . 
  we 'll have to disappear him . 
  pity that he was the last elephant . 
   a daily commute of 60 miles in the us is not uncommon , but in europe it 's unheard of . 
  i work in it in the netherlands and i can tell you that 60 mile daily commutes are not that uncommon here . 
  i commute by public transportation , but it takes me 1.5 hour one way . 
  however , in the netherlands employers can give you a tax free commuting allowance , and many do . 
  [ anna maria steinbach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/settela_steinbach ) , was a 10 year old dutch romani girl killed in auschwitz . 
  [ south holland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_holland_idb ) is in england , though :-), 
  we speak primarily dutch in the netherlands , although most people know english as a second language . 
  the netherlands * directly insulting someone is a punishable offense . 
  according to dutch law , both libel and insult are punishable by law . 
  insult can only be persecuted if the victim goes to the police . 
  however , when insulting government institutions , government workers in function or heads of state of allied nations the prosecutor can also start proceedings . 
  a separate law deals with insulting the king . 
  in theory , you can be jailed for insult , in practice , a fine is the worst you can expect . 
   suggesting the ownership of weapons for self defense is classified as `` inciting violence '' . 
  never heard of this . 
   one may never criticize any religion this was always allowed . 
  however , there was an anti-blasphemy law in the netherlands until 2014 . 
  nobody had been convicted under this law for a long time . 
   laws heavily regulating what one can say online , and many countries outright forbid anything that might be seen as offensive . 
  if you go to the comment section of dutch online forums like geenstijl.nl , fok.nl or maroc.nl , you 'll see lots of offensive stuff . 
  `` have you seen this latest hbo comedy about a us republican candidate ? 
  the acting is kind of wooden but the dialogues are hilarious . '', 
  `` trump is a real candidate . '', 
  `` what ?! '', 
  in zurich , english is definitly better understood than french , so do n't bother to try non-fluent french . 
  places where lost of tourists arrive and are desoriented are favorites of pickpockets , but a bit of planning ( see other comments ) helps a lot . 
  i 've never been actually pickpocketed in europe , despite being regularly at places where there were pickpocket warnings . 
  however dramatic terrorist action are ( it 's what they go for ) , the chances of getting involved in a terrorist action neglegible . 
  travel to and in europe never stopped because of terroristm , and there have been terrorist acts for a long time . 
  come over and have fun !, 
  they market it as an accredited medical school for us and canadian students where tuition is significantly lower than at us medical schools . 
  there is a university level medical school on saba ( pop 1,824 ) that is accredited by the netherlands , canada and a number of us accreditation agencies . 
  however , it is far to expensive for antillean or dutch students . 
   you ca n't study medicine over there . 
  actually , [ you can ] ( http://www.saba.edu/ ) on saba ( population 1,824 ) , but this is a commercial institution for american students ( $ 14,000 per semester , about 10 times as expensive as dutch university ) . 
   does all of europe use this system for high school ? 
  german language countries do . 
  [ deaths by terror in western europe 1970-now to place things in perspective ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lwn1ruh.jpg ), 
  i drink buttermilk at lunch during the weekend ( and sometimes in the morning on weekdays ) . 
  but i do n't like chocolate sprinkles ( weird , right ? ), 
  the only thing i know about / u/jahnisland1 and you is that you both hate americans , so you should get along fine !, 
  if you 're a genuine refugee from the trump regime , not just someone coming to profit from ousr social-democratic welfare paradise . 
  but serious , i 'm fine with americans , there 's a us woman married to a dutch guy in our street . 
  and i have an american sister in law , she 's a sweety . 
   canadian forums people have explicitly said they 'd prefer a muslim neighbor to a random american definitly not true in the netherlands , although this has more to do with anti-muslim than with pro-american sentiments . 
   i 've been called a `` welfare tourist '' in the past for wanting to live in a functional social democracy if you 're healthy and educated , this is disingenious , if you come here temproarily to use `` free '' university or healthcare , there is some point to it . 
  i do n't think it would go over very well in the us , even in the permissive netherlands this was kind of frowned upon . 
  it beats an apple , though !, 
  they are less developed . 
  there are reserved places in some studies that have strict selection ( like medicine ) for students from the dutch antillies . 
  that 's all i can think of .
