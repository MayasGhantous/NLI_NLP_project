  there 's a lot more of them , for one thing . 
   hedgehogs in europe in the netherlands , i see them quite often in our garden or on the green area before our house in a suburb . 
  my daughter spotted two of them mating from her bedroom window . 
  badgers are pretty rare , and protected animals . 
  learn europanto , it 's easy and fun and we all speak it : welches esse der objective des europese unione ? 
  * win der nexte europese fussballe championnato * convince swisserlandia de join , dann dissolve der unione * integrate europese countries * finde eine alternative aan '' jeux sans fronti\u00e8res '' * subtracte dinero aan germania por lo give aan andere countries * make dinero mit autostradale tolls * entertain maxime annoyed europese ministres * make franza believe que commande * make grosse britannia believe que esse in europe * make die andere europese countries believe que esse eine advantage de join . 
  in general there are strict safety rules and de people you see are probably part of the operating team . 
  was there last year , truely magnificent . 
   possible expansion into europe they tried , did n't work . 
  tattoos are very common here in the netherlands , i think about 30 % of the population has one . 
  totally depends on the design , location and quality how it reflects on the person . 
  btw i 'm not a big fan of tattoos myself .

  but these are extremely rare . 
  the rest of your outfit will be more important here than your hair length . 
  note that in the netherlands conscripted soldiers won the right to keep long hair if they wanted , back when conscripted soldiers were still called up . 
  totally legal , there are situations in the netehrlands where it is n't legal to carry it , but buying and owning one is no problem . 
  i ordered a large victorinox for my son a few years ago on amazone.de with no trouble . 
  100,000 syrians ca n't be wrong !, 
  they 're strips of grass along footwalks where the grass is kept short . 
  [ not too bad ] ( http://www.bredavandaag.nl/sites/bredavandaag/files/styles/large/public/fotos/201009/hondenuitlaatplaats.jpg?itok=hehx_cql ),

  we have designated dog-shitting places everywhere where you do n't have to pick up after your dog . 
  it implies there 's something genetically wrong with immigrants . 
  it would force people to choose between their personal safety and the choice to have ( children ) in the future , which is wrong . 
  the nazi 's offered the same choice to jews married to gentiles in may country ( be sterilized or be sent to the camps ) . 
  but not put up a tent for the night , just to be clear . 
  not exactly obscure , but : [ escher in the palace ] ( http://www.escherinhetpaleis.nl/?lang=en ) has 150 m.c. 
  escher prints and an exibition of optical illusions . 
  [ gevangenpoort ] ( http://gevangenpoort.nl/en/homepage ) or prison gate is a building that served as a prison four 400 years and has an exibition on the history of justice including an authentic torture chamber . 
  small . 
  i think small breweries were already popular here before the whole craft beer thing in the us , it was more a reaction to interesting belgian beers . 
  somehow he 's still in 1995 . 
  there are 312 breweries in the netherlands , mostly small craft beer makers . 
  there 's one within 5 minutes of my house , and their beers are nice . 
  they also make moonshine !, 
  / r/amsterdam also has an excellent wiki with tips for visitors . 
   europeans find american staff annoying and overbearing . 
  in general , i really appreciated american staff . 
  we simply ca n't understand why * anyone * could vote for him . 
  but that was the same for berlusconi . 
  american humorist , essayist and anti-colonialist , he made fun of the german language . 
  did n't read any of his work . 
   so all i have to go on are stories and gossip that 's all you 're going to find here :-) religion is just as complicated , different and regional here . 
  i 'm from the netherlands , and even moving from the catholic south to a liberal island in the protestant `` bible belt '' ( yes , we have one here too ) has made quite a difference . 
  i lived in honolulu for 16 month , had a great time . 
  only visited california for comparison . 
  in some countries this is customary/required , in others its unusual/not done . 
  hence my question . 
  they really need the money !, 
  we were in greece in june and it was awesome !, 
  no , not really , although it would be awesome if you were invited for the eurovision song festival . 
  greece is one of the `` big spenders '' in europe when it comes to the military . 
   better roads he/she is n't kidding there . 
  western union will be able to send your money to the us but they are n't exactly cheap . 
   personally i 'm not sure what exactly they use to transfer money . 
  i was amazed when i moved to the us in 1998 that i could n't simply tell my bank to transfer x amount to somebody else 's account , but had to send/give the other person a check . 
  transferring money that way is easy , free and very safe . 
  swiss are probably safer than irish , they have bombs . 
   everyone over the age of 18 owns a gun and has had military training , do n't do anything stupid . 
  but very few people carry guns there . 
  but you wo n't find us movies in the orginal without subtitles .

  no , not really .

  many people were expecting a russian attack and nuclear war . 
  i second lonely planet , their guides are pretty comprehensive on the practicalities , very useful for inexperienced travelers . 
  france is nice , have fun !, 
  man and woman are easy , it gets tricky with more abstract nouns that have a gender . 
  people ( including myself ) often make mistakes here and make more words female de staat en * zijn * verantwoordelijkheid . 
  ( = the state and its responsibility ) male gender ( his ) is correct here . 
  de vereniging en * haar * verantwoordelijkheid ( = the society and its responsibility ) female gender ( her ) is correct here . 
  amsterdam : wear what you like in the streets , although flip-flops will make you stand out as a foreigner , those are beachwear in the netherlands . 
  nice flats are appropriate everywhere , but you 'll do a lot of walking in amsterdam so pick something comfortable . 
  as for clubs , it mainly counts what kind of image you want to project . 
  flipflops might get you refused in the more picky establishments . 
  high heels are n't necessary though if you do n't like them . 
  [ map of shorter hikes in the netherlands that start and end at a railway station . ] ( http://www.wandelnet.nl/ns-wandeltochten/kaart ) . 
  if you think of yosemite of something like that when you want to go hiking , hiking in the netherlands is not really for you , we do n't have many large nature areas . 
  but there are many long distance paths that will lead you through historic villages and estates , interesting man-made landscapes and smaller nature areas . 
  long distance buses , for example eurolines , can be a very cheap way to make longer trips . 
  yes , i saw a whole family with three kids on their bikes in utrecht , all with helmets , and the boys crashed into each other . 
  comment in my bus : they must be german . 
  pontsycyllte aquaduct ( `` the stream in the sky '' ) near llangollen is amazing and not to be missed . 
  [ site ] ( http://www.pontcysyllte-aqueduct.co.uk/ ), 
  in the southernmost parts of the nederlands , where limestone was mined , you have `` bacon-style '' buildings combining limestone and brick in bands for a decorative effect . 
  [ see dutch wikipedia article here ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/band_%28bouwkundig%29 ) . 
  maastricht in the netherlands has many historic limestone buildings and is a beautiful town to visit . 
  the limestone quarries are large [ cave systems near the town that have guided tours ] ( http://www.maastrichtunderground.nl/eng ) and are not to be missed . 
  old farms in the south sometimes use the wooden frame/clay filling system . 
  however , the main building material in most of the netherlands has always been [ brick ] ( http://www.jackbazen.nl/nederland/muiden/muiden_slot.jpg ) .
