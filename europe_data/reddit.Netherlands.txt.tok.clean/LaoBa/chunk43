  [ thatched roofs ] ( http://www.rietendak.nu/media/slideshow/boerderij-rieten-kap.jpg ) were widely used and are still popular in the countryside !, 
   it seems like every nation outside of the west does not see immigrants and diversity as vibrant or whatever . 
  they would rather remain as culturally homogeneous as they can . 
  many non-western countries have massive numbers of immigrants and/or refugees . 
  for example , iran has nearly a million afghan refugees !, 
  to be more precise : 71 % of all * households * have at least one car . 
  23 % have two or more cars . 
  if you look at one-person households , car ownership is only 45 % . 
  note that most people who own cars also use bikes for transportation ion the netherlands . 
  61 % of the population ( this includes minors ) has a driving licence . 
  anecdotal here : we are a two adult/two teen family who live in a 35.000 people town and do n't own a car , we use car sharing about twice a month . 
  i have a 50km ( 30 mile ) commute which i do by bike , train and bus . 
  my wife works within walking distance of our house . 
  our kids go to school about 5 miles from our house , they use bicycles . 
  well , i wish you all the best anyway . 
  moving somewhere else will probably not help if you have awful anxiety problems , you 'll need to interact with people and now they are foreign which makes it harder . 
  a way to `` reset '' your life on the cheap is to do volunteer work for board and food , like with http://www.wwoof.net/ . 
  saudi arabia !, 
  are they muslims or not !, 
  and the us has a muslim president !, 
   controlled by jews , controlled by muslims or controlled by america porque no los tres ? 
   from a reliable source unless you do a good europe-wide poll , you 're not going to find your answer here . 
   wearing shoes in the house most people wear shoes inside the house in the netherlands . 
  first week of june . 
  most dutch people would love a guaranteed few weeks of true frosty weather for skating . 
  weather is n't the best though . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  ( in both meanings of the phrase ) . 
   i think the problem is that most people here are atheist/agnostic and do n't really have much experience in socializing with religious people . 
  i 'm maybe a bit older than most redditors but i know lots of religious people , although i 've been an atheist most of my life . 
  my father was atheistic and my mother christian ( she was a member of the [ walloon church ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walloon_church ) ) and it never was a problem in their relation . 
  i 've been to a protestant primary school and a catholic secondary school , but both of these were schools were religion was n't the main focus and other faiths ( or no faiths ) were respected . 
  i 'm totally familiar with silent praying before dinner even though i do n't do so myself . 
  personally ( but then , i 'm not christian so i might get this wrong ) there are definite advantages and disadvantages to being christian here compared to the us . 
  christian culture is more subtle and less pervasive here , for example i see that people in the us discuss what church the president goes to and who preaches there , that is totally a non-issue here . 
  we hardly have any atheist organizations here ( as in organisations promoting atheism , we have plenty of non-religious organisations here of course ) . 
  nobody cares that the state funds religious schools . 
  [ this newspaper ] ( http://www.refdag.nl/ ) also closes their site on sunday . 
  it 's the only way in the netherlands to keep any area low-density . 
   is it acceptable to be a person of faith that really believes in and lives by their faith ? 
  totally . 
  in general , this is still a tolerant country . 
  however , faith is seen as a private matter here . 
  preaching at work is frowned upon and can get you fired if you do n't desist despite warnings . 
  on the other hand , wearing a cross , a hijab or a kippah is okay in most private companies . 
   how would this impact social & professional situations , such as making friends or finding work ? 
  the netherlands used to be a country where people mostly socialized with people from their own religion/social class . 
  today this is less so but the more strict your religion ( especially judaism , islam and protestant christian ) the more likely you are to have most friends within your religion , as you socialize at school and church/mosque/synagogue . 
  there is some discrimination , especially against islamic people , although this is more ethnic than religious , but in general it will not impact your work very much . 
  religious discrimination when hiring is not allowed . 
  in practice it will depend a lot on the persons doing the hiring decisions and their conscious and subconscious decisions . 
  there are many people who are deeply and actively christian in my country , christian schools get financed by the state ( also muslim and jewish schools ) . 
  there are christian political parties that range from `` inspired by christian values '' to `` the bible should be the reference for everything '' . 
  the last party has a website which is closed on sunday . 
  rome for english speakers . 
  that we were n't interested or that the news was impartial ? 
  it depend a lot on country and social-economic station . 
  in the netherlands , many people do diy projects either to save money of just because they like diy . 
  you must realize that shorter working weeks mean that people do have more time for diy here even without using vacation days . 
  i had some extra vacation when i moved last time ( from changing jobs ) and i used that redoing the ceilings and painting indoors in our new house , but when we had an extra floor added we did all the indoor finishing in evenings and the weekends . 
  having a stationary caravan as a vacation home is common here , so people drive like two or three hours to kick back and relax , instead of going on trips abroad . 
  it was totally not a thing in the netherlands ( a few small newspaper articles ) that mentioned all the confusing facts without making assumptions about her guilt/innocence . 
  radio netherlands worldwide ceased broadcasting ( in dutch , english and indonesian ) in 2012 because of budget cuts . 
  many sights will be much quieter , so if you want to visit places like venice it 's much better . 
  also there will be wine harvest festivals !, 
  in the netherlands , servers were not paid and dependent on tips until 1951 , when a service charge was introduced , making tipping an extra . 
  dutch people do still tip , but usually only small amounts . 
  say what you will about stag parties but they never have big fat suitcases . 
   amsterdam / r/amsterdam has an awesome wiki full of good traveler info . 
  if you want really specific info ask them , but all the usual ( places to eat/drink/stay / visit ) have been covered in the wiki . 
   bruges very touristy though , about the definition of the beaten path . 
  [ some excellent explanations of groningens success as a bicycle city ] ( http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2009/02/how-groningen-grew-to-be-worlds-number.html ) . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modal_share ) , 38 % of all trips are made by bike in amsterdam vs only 26 % in copenhagen . 
  [ this table ] ( http://www.cityclock.org/urban-cycling-mode-share/#.vnnuafnf9bw ) also places amsterdam before copenhagen , although groningen comes out on top . 
  the netherlands : [ anton philips ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anton_philips ) and [ gerard philips ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerard_philips ) , founders of [ philips ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philips ) lightbulb and consumer electronics . 
  ( 122,000 employeers worldwide ) . 
  industrialists with a social vision who provided their company hometown with a world class research facility and a famous soccer team ( psv ) . 
  the philips family is fondly remembered . 
  banker lion philips , the grandfather of gerard and anton , was a tobacco trader and an important sponsor of his nephew karl marx . 
  [ freddy heineken ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freddy_heineken ) turned the [ heineken ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heineken_international ) beer company founded by his grandfather into the third largest brewer in the world . 
  he was a well known and generally well liked personage in the netherlands . 
  [ henri deterding ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_deterding ) , co-founder and long-time ceo of [ royal dutch shell ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_dutch_shell ) , fourth largest company in the world . 
  his heritage is tainted by his pro-nazi stance in the 1930 's . 
  he died in 1939 . 
  [ petrus regout ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/petrus_regout ) , founder of the sphinx ceramics industry in maastricht . 
  the first large-scale industrialist of the netherlands , he is also remembered because of the terrible working conditions in his factory , and his statue in the town has often been defaced . 
  netherlands : * french fries with mayonnaise ( at any snack bar ) * broodje gezond ( `` healthy sandwich '' ) with salad , tomato , egg and cheese ( at snack bars and lunch rooms ) broodje gezond should be vegetarian , but in rare cases contains ham , so ask when in doubt . 
  * kaasbroodje ( puff pastry with cheese ) at lunchrooms and supermarket counters * falafel ( at any middle-eastern snack bar ) * poffertjes ( miniature pancakes , sold at a [ poffertjeskraam ] ( http://www.dutchfoodie.nl/wp-content/uploads/20120416-120449-560x420.jpg ) ) * oliebollen and appelflappen ( dough fritters and apple fritters , sold at a ( oudhollandse ) [ gebakkraam ] ( http://media.nu.nl/m/m1cz2j8aohqw.jpg ) , november/december only ) all of these are cheap and provide plenty of calories , although not always very healthy ones :-), 
   makes me think people are protesting too much . 
  for better or for worse , us media have a large footprint . 
  well , if european news programs started claiming something completely ridiculous about the us , do n't you think us news and politicians would n't react ? 
  our political system and its manifestations are quite different , but that does n't mean people in my country ( the netherlands ) do n't discuss politics or are n't interested . 
  the way politics are structured here means we need a lot less volunteers : politicians do n't do much fundraising ( political parties get free advertising time ) , door to door canvassing is rare , everyone eligible is automatically registered to vote and is invited to the polls by letter ( so no registration drives ) and strong adversarial politics/dirty tricks are really not very strong here and would turn most people of . 
  campaigning is much shorter and more relaxed . 
  and we do n't have primaries . 
   does this provide opportunities for someone that truly is passionate ? 
  certainly , you can join a party and get active at municipal or national level . 
  even more important , new parties can rapidly grow and become a force to recon with in our politics , so if you feel `` the people are n't heard '' then trying to give them a voice has a chance . 
  the right-wing pvv that hold 10 % of the parliamentary seats was founded in 2006 , not as a split-off of an existing party . 
  because of proportional voting , smaller parties do get represented and once they are in the parliament also get funding .
