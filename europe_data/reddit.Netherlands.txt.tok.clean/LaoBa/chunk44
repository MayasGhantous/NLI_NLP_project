  you 're welcome . 
  i left zurich years ago , so i do n't have much recent info , but i lived there for years and loved it !, 
  / r/zurich might be of use . 
  zurich has a very dense network of public transportation , they have day passes which enable you to use all the trams , buses and railways inside the city . 
  it 's also more fun than a car . 
  unfortunately , some of the great things of zurich , like swimming in the lake and the river or hanging around on the lakeside are n't an option now . 
  just rambling through the medieval streets in the center ( on both sides of the limmat river ) is always a good start . 
  if you like art , the [ kunsthaus ] ( http://www.kunsthaus.ch/en/ ) and the [ sammlung e.g. 
  b\u00fchrle ] ( http://www.buehrle.ch/?lang=en ) are worthwhile , although the b\u00fchrle collection can only be visited on the first sunday of the month for individual visitors , and you have to make an appointment . 
  the [ rietberg museum ] ( http://www.rietberg.ch/en-gb/foyer.aspx ) ( asian art ) and the [ bellerive museum ] ( http://www.museum-bellerive.ch/?l=1 ) ( design ) are both charming locations , beautiful old villa 's with good exhibitions . 
  a hike that you should try if the weather is clear is from uetliberg to felsenegg . 
  you can take a train ( s10 ) from the central station/hauptbahnhof ) to the top of the uetliberg ( 20 minutes ) . 
  there you 'll find a decent restaurant , some bizarre benches and streetlights by artist bruno weber , and a lookout tower . 
  now you can either take one of the signposted trails back to the city , or follow the ridge to felsenegg , an easy walk of about 6 kilometer , with views of the snowy alps on your right and of lake zurich on your left . 
  the walking route also has a scale model of the solar system . 
  at felsenegg , you can take a cable-car back down to the city , and a tram back to the central station . 
  good places for fondue at 30 francs or less , according to local zurich newspaper : * ** [ degenried ] ( http://www.degenried.ch/ ) ** , degenriedstrasse 135 8032 z\u00fcrich ( it 's in the forest , close to the dolder hotel . ), 
  * ** [ frau gerolds wintergarten ] ( http://www.fraugerold.ch/ ) ** geroldstr . 
  23 , 8005 z\u00fcrich ( hip , modern pavillion in the trendy hard-area , closed on sundays ) * ** [ fribourger fonduest\u00fcbli ] ( http://www.fribourger-fondue-stuebli.ch/ ) ** rotwandstr . 
  38 8004 z\u00fcrich ( fribourg style fondue with lots of vacherin cheese ) * ** [ ch\u00e4salp ] ( http://www.chaesalp.ch/welcome.html ) ** tobelhofstr . 
  236 , 8044 z\u00fcrich ( charming old farmhouse on the edge of the city , but easy to reach by car or public transportation ), 
  yes , walking on the highway can get you a 360 euro fine . 
  the only people allowed to walk along a highway is only allowed for those whose vehicles got stuck . 
  with highways i mean the high speed/separate lane roads . 
  you are not allowed to walk past [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/zeichen_330.svg/260px-zeichen_330.svg.png ) or [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/nederlands_verkeersbord_g3.svg/220px-nederlands_verkeersbord_g3.svg.png ) sign . 
  so you have to stand before the signs if you hitchhike , because cars are not allowed to stop on the highway to pick you up , either . 
  come on , give them a `` lift '' in your awesome car !, 
  hitchhiking is rare these days in the netherlands because university students get free public transportation . 
  i used to do it on a regular base in the past , netherlands is small so it is feasible . 
  walking and hitchhiking on highways is prohibited , you can try exits and gas stations . 
  as a woman alone hitchhiking is easiest ( but also the most risky ) , as two women or a mixed couple okay , as two or more guys hard . 
  netherlands is generally safe but of course you always take some risk while hitchhiking . 
  the fastest way is to politely approach drivers at highway gas stations , however , you 'll need to speak dutch or good english . 
  making a sign with your destination that you can hold up also works . 
  public transportation is very good , also renting a bike ( on a one day base or for longer ) , we have very good bike paths and routes all over the country , but it will be cold in february . 
   do they have many baggage restrictions too ? 
  i 'm just planning to take a carry-on rolling bag and my backback/laptop bag . 
  usually not ( big advantage of trains ) , however it depends a lot on the train how much luggage space they provide . 
  this can be a problem on crowded trains . 
  long distance buses can be a good alternative in some countries , they are generally cheap and have a locked baggage compartment for your carry-on rolling bag . 
  also , they may provide wifi . 
  see for example http://www.eurolines.com/, 
  ca n't say for france , but here in the netherlands it 's pretty popular among rural/motorcycling/country music/trucking fans/people , it has zero right-wing or racist associations . 
  in the netherlands , small tattoos are pretty mainstream these days . 
  however , the higher educated , the less tattoos . 
  try http://www.expatica.com/nl// and the wiki of / r/amsterdam for more information about moving temporarily to the netherlands . 
  healthcare in the netherlands is n't free , you 'll pay $ 135-150 per month with a yearly deductible of $ 460 . 
  this should cover almost any medical treatments * that are prescribed by medical professionals * , dutch medicine is less service-oriented then us healthcare . 
  the dutch are worries too , we have affordable insurance for almost anything here :-) you can bring a dog if it has had certain shots and [ this form ] ( http://www3.vwa.nl/import/certificaten/digd012001a.pdf ) filled out and stamped by a vet . 
  you should check on expatica if there are more requirements . 
  although amsterdam is a fascinating city , remember there are many other great places in the netherlands , many of them a lot cheaper . 
  by the way , i lived 1.5 year in the us with my wife and toddler and we had a great time . 
  the older you get , the harder it is to move abroad for a year , so if you 're up for it , go for the adventure !, 
  this is the guy who thinks , when marijuana is starting to be legal in more and more places , that it 's a good idea to start restricting it more in the netherlands . 
  [ this classic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgbokbeadr0 ) from `` das kleine arschloch '' shows there is a country following in germany !, 
  see also [ www.country.de ] ( http://www.country.de/ ), 
  did n't like that song much , [ here is a much nicer one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xjdamqatui ) by ilse de lange . 
  in the netherlands we have woonwagenbewoners ( dutch travellers ) , dutch roma , dutch-indonesians , suriname blacks , antillean blacks , suriname hindustani , suriname indonesians , moluccans , chinese , moroccans , turks , all with dutch nationality . 
  each of these minorities has a different image and gets treated differently , i think . 
  woonwagenbewoners are not discernible by skin tone but still more marginalized/negatively perceived than dutch-indonesian , for example . 
  the real controversy is turning a big part of care for the sick and elderly over to the municipalities while cutting a lot of funding . 
  cool site where you can see how popular a name was and is in the netherlands : [ meertens instituut ] ( http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/english ) . 
  for example [ there are about 4000 williams born in the netherlands ] ( http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/naam/is/william ) , but the peak of popularity was around 1970 . 
  also there is at least one woman born in the netherlands with william as first name !, 
  you might have heard of joran van der sloot , suspected of having killed nathalie holloway . 
  [ see what happened to the popularity of that name !, 
  i think the eu has accomplished a lot in matters of peace , economics and development . 
  cooperation is the way forward . 
  of course , there are still many things in the eu that could be improved . 
  macedonia, 
  we 're not as flat as denmark :-), 
  office etiquette differs a lot between european countries , so beware and read up !, 
  they were quite popular in the netherlands about 30 years ago . 
  much slower than the thalys . 
  7 vs 3.18 hours . 
   science ? 
  tell me the secrets of good us cheese . 
  from [ this source , top 10 superyacht builders to make your dream a reality ] ( http://agenceluxury.com/top-10-superyacht-builders-to-make-your-dream-a-reality/ ) : feadship , which stands for first export association of dutch shipbuilders , is recognized as the world leader in pure custom-built yachts . 
  based in the netherlands , the company launched more than 250 superyachts since 1949 and specializes in newly built motoryachts between 40 and 100 meters . 
  of the top 10 , four are dutch ( feadship , heesen , amels and oceanco ) , two are german ( l\u00fcrssen and blohm & voss ) , two are italian ( perini navi and benetti ) , one is american ( trinity yachts ) and one is danish ( christensen ) . 
  of the american company , it says `` one of the elite builders of custom superyachts with focus on * european quality * , steel and aluminum constructions . '', 
  [ vekoma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vekoma ) from vlodrop : over 270 rollercoasters build worldwide !, 
  [ their site ] ( http://www.vekoma.com/ ), 
  also building roller coasters , bicycle infrastructure . 
  not really , people are fairly relaxed about that here . 
   the * idea * behind a lot of american gun culture ( note the idea , not necessarily the reality ) is that it acts as a deterrent to crime . 
  having lived in the us and europe , i note that for its supposed deterrent americans generally feel less safe than europeans , while you would expect the opposite . 
  i mean , criminals should be rare in the us because they knowingly take the risk that their victims are armed . 
  but apparently it does n't work that way . 
   does n't this put people in a situation where they have to know their life is in danger before they can use force ? 
  it does . 
  you ca n't shoot someone inside your home after breaking and entering , this is still not sufficient proof they mean you bodily harm in the netherlands . 
  gun ownership is low in the netherlands , 70.000 people in a population of 17 million . 
  of these , 40.000 are sports shooters and 30.000 hunters . 
  the police in the netherlands knows that strict gun control laws wo n't keep guns away from criminals , but it makes it easy to convict criminals for the illegal possession of weapons , other crimes are often harder to prove . 
  i lived in zurich and day hikes in the alps are well feasible using trains and buses , especially since you do n't have to finish your hike where you started if you don ' y have a car . 
  for the netherlands , [ these people ] ( http://www.st-otherwise.org/ ) might have useful contacts . 
  the freemasons are active in the netherlands , i 'm in a 35000 inhabitants town and there are 2 lodges here . 
  also a lion 's club . 
  the dutch can do scottish ch just fine .
