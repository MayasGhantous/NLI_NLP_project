  comics : [ soeperman ] ( https://s.s-bol.com/imgbase0/imagebase3/large/fc/8/1/4/8/9200000021798418.jpg ) - our local superhero [ gilles de geus ] ( http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/gilles_de_geus_ii_7753.jpg ) - former highwayman , hero of the dutch revolt [ agent 327 and his swiss colleague olga lawina ] ( https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2014/3/10/e/8/b/e8b82334-a87e-11e3-9135-dd80821a0158.jpg ) - the dutch answer to james bond [ franka ] ( https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/1/7/3/d/73d620c0-8e6b-012b-6571-fb97f8715254.jpg ) - girl detective, 
  valerian and laureline ad\u00e8le blanc-sec, 
  warm water is warm . 
  there are very few roma , sinti and jenische in the netherlands , even less after the nazi genocide . 
  we have ethnic dutch travelers who are partly their own culture . 
  they live in small camps [ with trailers made to look like white-brick houses ] ( http://cloud.pubble.nl/f55ba9dd/content/imp/3b97168f0c327c8e307f9447d72508f8.jpg ) . 
  they are mostly low-educated and rather clannish . 
  some well-known people like soccer player rafael van der vaart and singer frans bauer are from the dutch traveler community . 
  we do get a few eastern european roma these days , making music at stations or hawking magazines at supermarkets . 
  prime minister mark rutte [ cycles to work ] ( https://investinholland.com/nfia_media/2015/06/blog_rutte_bike_anp.jpg ) , is considered [ a hunk in china ] ( http://imgur.com/qory51g ) , teaches [ civics in a school in a working class area of the hague ] ( http://www.sevendays.nl/sites/default/files/anp-28671213.jpg ) two hours per week , is single and likes to be nude at home ( sorry , no pics ) . 
  i thought it was [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq4qhoxmkpq ), 
  they took all the patriotic songs , here [ waar aan de blanke top der duinen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l8zm8je4di ) at an nsb meeting . 
  our national anthem is from 1572 and we have another patriotic song merck toch hoe sterck from 1626 :-), 
  [ waar de blanke top der duinen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0byui9cwke ) ( where the white and gleaming dune top ) from 1870 , very patriotic song about the love for the netherlands . 
  [ merck toch hoe sterck ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zudrbmhia0 ) ( notice how strong ) cool song from 1626 ( ! ), 
  about the siege of bergen op zoom and the fight against the spanish . 
  [ wien ne\u00earlands bloed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdyo83o6vje ) ( whoever has dutch blood flowing in their veins ) was our national anthem from 1815-1932 . 
  the original text which mentions `` dutch blood free from foreign blemishes `` is a bit controversial today . 
  we also have [ an old song ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/weerbaarhedenlied ) about belgium with really unmentionable lyrics about genocide and rape . 
  i 'm not religious myself but i liked christmas as a time of togetherness and peace ( and nice food ) , not as a time of commercialism . 
  not to bad though the winters are a bit gloomy . 
   what do you think would be ideal ? 
  i lived in honolulu and found the climate pretty much perfect . 
  american christmas culture : santa claus , reindeer , everyone wearing santa hats , present-giving at christmas , us christmas songs on the radio 24/7 . 
  it used to be a family-oriented holiday that did n't hide it 's religious origins , and we have sinterklaas ( st. nicholas ) for giving presents anyway on december 5th . 
  pizza 's are never delivered by car here , it 's by moped . 
  it is a very low paid job for young people . 
  knowing my countrymen , tipping wo n't be that much . 
   do your pizza delivery guys get robbed ? 
  rarely but it happens . 
  not really . 
  i know a few people with guns because they hunt or shoot competitively , but collecting automatic weapons is extremely rare . 
  it is possible though to get a permit for collecting . 
  i really like chinese culture . 
  i love my country , and think it is worth some sacrifices . 
  but apart from [ van speijk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_van_speyk ) we 're usually not much of a `` die for your country `` people , if there is a smarter alternative . 
  i lived in switzerland for 5 years . 
  loved it , excellent quality of life even though housing prices were crazy where we lived . 
  made some great swiss friends . 
  we returned because our residence permit was no longer renewed , it was based on us doing our phd there . 
  in some very general stuff , yes , but i never voted for the largest parties , for example . 
  fathers family came from altona , germany around 1820 . 
  mother 's family from the baltics around 1470 , and my grandmother on mother 's side was half-black . 
  i wo n't say there is n't any racism here , but nobody cares about your ancestry . 
  i lived in z\u00fcrich for years , i loved it !, 
  sorry , it 's the throat sounds . 
   it 's like cute german , witch too many harsh ch 's mixed in . 
  that 's a good description of [ schwiitzert\u00fc\u00fctsch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3-ufpcubse ), 
  i do assocate it with japanese imperialism , but i do n't have a strong reaction to it . 
  cheese slicers - boska, 
  most went home rather fast though . 
  so who were you ? 
  air conditioner ? 
  in a private home ? 
  dutch actors : * carel struycken ( lurch in the addams family , the giant in twin peaks , mr. homn in star trek : the next generation ) * famke janssen ( xenia onatopp in goldeneye , jean grey / phoenix in the x-men film series , lenore mills in the taken film trilogy ) * rutger hauer ( flesh + blood , blade runner , the hitcher , sin city , ladyhawke , buffy the vampire slayer movie , hobo with a shotgun , many more ) * yorick van wageningen ( the chronicles of riddick , the girl with the dragon tattoo ) * michiel huisman ( sonny in treme , daario naharis in game of thrones ), 
   valerian and laureline cool comics though , i love them , got them all in dutch translation . 
  i hope the movie will be fun , but i have low expectations . 
  they even made laureline blonde . 
  father 35 , mother 31 . 
  i was 32 and my wife 33 when we had our first child . 
  dutch average is brought down by 1.80 m dwarfs from our non-flooding provinces . 
  * dutch people are the tallest in the world because 1 in 3 dutch kids of below average length die in floods before they are 19 , the official age at which you can reproduce in the netherlands . 
  * tiny kox , taco monster and vajayjay lovers are actual names in the netherlands . 
  * amsterdam offers free daycare for mothers working in the red-light district . 
  * remorseful germans are returning the bikes they stole in the netherlands during the war , actually so many of them that amsterdam now has a bike overcrowding problem . 
  * french gourmets are concerned about the availability of truffles as most of the harvest is now exported to the netherlands for sale in smartshops . 
  * dutch prime minister mark rutte is the first male head of state with an openly lesbian wife . 
  * the blades of windmills were used as giant semaphores to convey messages during the war . 
  when the germans caught on , they tried to destroy all windmills in the country . 
  * you are only allowed to buy a car in the netherlands if you can prove that own at least one bicycle . 
  * there used to be a pro-pedophilia party in the netherlands but the founder has resigned to spend more time with his family . 
  * there are some radical amish-like protestant communities in the netherlands that reject any technology invented after 1700 , but they get little media exposure because you ca n't bring camera 's or even ballpoints to report on their villages . 
  * finches are also a popular dish in the netherlands and you can find them in any supermarket . 
  * dutch king william alexander shut up vladimir putin during his recent visit of state by proclaiming : `` but i have the blood of the holy russian czars in my veins , and you do n't ! '', 
  jeanne calment !, 
  my uncle and aunt met her , my uncle is a descendant of vincent van gogh 's brother , and jeanne calment met vincent van gogh when she was a young girl . 
  the us rejected thailand 's declaration of war too . 
  frisian is recognized as a separate language in the netherlands . 
  it is taught in school in the province of frisia . 
  luxembourgish is a national language of luxembourg and is taught in school since 1912 . 
  swiss german is a bit more tricky , there is no standard and it is not an official language , but having lived in switzerland i can tell you it is really pervasive . 
  z\u00fcrich , where i lived , requires the use of swiss-german in kindergarten . 
  yes . 
  and no , i do n't have taken part . 
  the `` make the streets safe for bicycles '' thing is pretty redundant here . 
  100 % chance op has been there but [ de efteling ] ( https://www.efteling.com/en ) is a great theme park . 
  if a shoarma restaurant is called tel aviv , i assume it 's run by israelis . 
  but jews do n't stand out here , we 're fairly private about our religion . 
  there are about 50.000 jews in a 17 million population here . 
  i had a jewish professor in university ( he has some 6-person connection to my family ) . 
  i did live in a neighborhood in z\u00fcrich where quite a lot of more conservative jews lived , i could see their outdoor fridges in their apartments . 
   i know most , if not all europeans are bothered by jews . 
  wtf ? 
  most people in the netherlands have no problem at all with jews . 
  * dutch * frisian * [ limburgish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limburgish_language ) * afrikaans * german * luxembourgish * swiss german ( not what they speak in wallis , though ) * english * french, 
  they do exist here but are n't that common . 
  probably , but bandwidth is pretty low . 
  i love reading books or my ereader on the train , so no need for wifi !, 
  [ the trains are pretty comfortable ] ( https://nederlandonderweg.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/virm_nieuw_2klas.jpg ) ( this is the lower deck , i 'm usually on the upper one ) but never this empty !,
