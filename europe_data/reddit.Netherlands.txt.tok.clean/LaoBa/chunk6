  but i usually manage to find a seat . 
  the bus is [ this impressive monster ] ( http://www.michaeltaylor.ca/bus-nl/utrecht/gvu-4918-mt.jpg ) , a van hool agg300 which can transport like 180 passengers !, 
  they go every 4 minutes so if i miss one or if it is full it is no big deal . 
  note that legal drinking age in the netherlands is 18 and they crack down much harder that they used to in the past . 
  twinings passionfruit , mango & orange tea twinings lady grey kistje van de keizer darjeeling, 
  iceland was great , i went there on vacation last year , would like to visit finland to compare !, 
  have fun !, 
  two weeks traveling/camping in july , but we have n't decided where yet . 
  maybe scotland or scandinavia . 
   do you usually take a summer holiday ? 
  oh yes !, 
  this is the last year we 'll still be constrained by the school vacations , my son just graduated . 
   what do you usually do ? 
  mostly camping with a tent and a car . 
   where do you usually go ? 
  we do n't have a `` usual '' . 
  we visited the netherlands , belgium , france , scotland , germany , czechia , iceland and california the last 10 years . 
  yes , but saying `` ze is een schoon meisje '' is only used in old poetry . 
  in dutch detective means private detective , while rechercheur means police detective . 
  in switzerland , they have kloten balsberg station . 
  smoking , oldtimer and beamer are used in the same way in dutch , but handy and messy are n't . 
  we also use body for leotard . 
  70 km , bike , then train , then bus . 
  takes 80 minutes . 
  combined daily workout and reading time . 
  my wife has a 500 m commute , she takes her bike or walks . 
  maybe have a european union with net neutrality legislation ? 
  you can consider the dutch revolt/80 years war a civil war , because the country was n't unified in it 's opposition to the hapsburgs . 
  reasons fro the revolt were religious persecution , taxation and protest against the centralization of government . 
  in 1830 , the southern part of the netherlands revolted and there was a civil war of north against south , but south won with french and belgian assistance , leading to the state of belgium . 
  reasons were the absolutist rule of king willem i and the antagonism between the catholic ( and partly french-speaking ) south and the protestant north . 
  the board is used for a game called trictrac in dutch , but is not the same as the french [ trictrac ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/trictrac ) . 
  it is more related to [ acey-deucey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acey-deucey ) then to backgammon . 
  it was very popular in the 1980 's and 1990 's , and was especially popular ( sorry for the stereotype ) among weed users who played it in coffee shops . 
  in the late 1970 's , my mom and my brother played this every day after school . 
   square mortarboards very recent us import , though . 
  [ phd thesis defense ] ( https://static.tue.nl/fileadmin/content/onderzoek/institute_for_complex_molecular_systems_-_icms/1_about/icms_downloads/defense_peter_korevaar_01.jpg ) is done in white tie for the phd candidate and the assistants . 
  i 've worn white tie exactly twice in my lifetime , at my own thesis defense and when i was assistant at someone else 's . 
  i 'm okay with it , it has worked since we have universal suffrage . 
  my main criticism is that politics are sometimes too focused on the randstad area . 
  when i was young the books by astrid lindgren were very popular , and we watched emiel ( emil ) and pippi langkous ( pippi l\u00e5ngstrump ) . 
  personally , i read the pippi books and the brothers lionheart , but not de kinderen van bolderburen ( the bullerby children ) . 
  there is also a south nederlands-luxembourg connection . 
  kurrent is relatively close to the handwriting i learned in school , so i can read fraktur and and kurrent if i need to . 
  s\u00fctterlin looks like it was written by tolkien , and is 95 % unreadable for me . 
  `` ist '' is the only word i think i recognize in [ this text ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%bctterlin#/media/file:s%c3%bctterlin.svg ), 
  i 'm old enough to have read some children 's books in this spelling , so i find it kind of nice . 
  we had one until 2013 in the netherlands , but the last time someone was charged with blasphemy was in 1968 . 
  however , in the dutch caribbean it is forbidden to display blasphemous material in public since 2010 . 
   extreme left like wageningen that was a good laugh . 
  that would still make million ** s ** in the last months unlikely , do n't you think ? 
  do you think belgians fee dutch ? 
   millions of refugees in the last months although there are many , that is exaggerated . 
  about a million came in 2015 , in 2016 the number was lower and the first six months of 2017 did n't show a surge . 
  no , we do n't really have this mentality , we have `` doe maar normaal , dan doe je al gek genoeg '' ( act normal , that 's strange enough already ) which means you should n't want to stand out . 
  `` een goede buur is beter dan een verre vriend '' ( a good neighbor is better than a friend far away ) `` al te goed is buurman 's gek '' ( be too nice and you become your neighbors doormat ), 
  yes , people in switzerland have taken me for german , in egypt for egyptian ( just by looks , i do n't speak arabic ) , in the us for american . 
  [ battle of sudomer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4mkbwcoce4 ) from the movie jan zizka . 
  [ battle of vitkov hill ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qcfcwf5ele ) from the movie against all enemies . 
  the brothers de witt being ripped to pieces by a crowd would also make an impressive movie scene . 
  i do n't have one , i have a small kitchen and i can use a wok for deep-frying spring rolls . 
  frites i can get from the local snack bar if i need them . 
  i hope for a strong , prosperous eu and a strong , prosperous uk . 
  i did enjoy tali-ihantala 1944 for its realism . 
  i have n't seen it but i 've read the combat scenes are quite realistic and thus probably a lot more boring than over-the-top hollywood war . 
  we use czechia ( tsjechi\u00eb ) in dutch , so no . 
  i prefer czechia . 
  [ danes fighting the german invasion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sopqfvlqmvo ) . 
  nzz does n't use schwizerd\u00fctsch . 
  the netherlands does n't have much unique natural environments , but we do have [ this ] ( http://www.ipa-noord-holland.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1345x700_tulpenveld_molen.jpg ) of course . 
  yes, 
  the dutch town where i grew up has an ice hockey team called the geleen smoke eaters ( because it was a mining and chemical industry town ) , these days they are called geleen eaters . 
  the team was started by canadian service members who were inspired by the [ british columbian trail smoke eaters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trail_smoke_eaters ), 
  people from don and york . 
  keep the sirens running , after a while you get the message something is wrong . 
  hungarian food is wonderful . 
  huge boring theme park . 
  it 's noon , the first monday of the month . 
  i 've never heard non anglo-saxon tourists using it . 
  it annoys me a lot if us media totally misrepresent facts about the netherlands to push a political agenda , like bill o'reilly or rick santorum on fox . 
  i find it even more annoying when british tabloids get out the nazi puns when germany or europe is involved . 
  palermo on the meuse : li\u00e8ge, 
  it 's the same how only anglo-saxon tourists call amsterdam dam or the dam . 
  maybe [ this graph ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/case/people-killed-by-terrorism-per-year-in-western-europe-1970-2015 ) will put things in perspective . 
  if you spend a ** year ** in western europe the chance you will be killed by terrorists is about 1 in 2,000,000 . 
  seeing that your chance to be killed in a car crash during a year in the us is 1 in 9,800 , i would n't worry too much . 
  put another way , i do live in europe and if i would spend my life actually ** trying ** to get killed in a genuine terrorist attack in western europe , i would be extremely unlikely to succeed in a whole lifetime . 
  many jobs do n't require dutch fluency in the netherlands , but for reasons of customer-friendliness , safety , and compliance it is n't possible to offer them to people who have no knowledge of dutch . 
  as things are , i 'm not aware that foreigners have problems finding jobs in the netherlands , but this is maybe because i have mainly worked in science and it . 
  i 've worked with colleagues who only spoke english at several it companies in amsterdam and amersfoort . 
  any ranking is subjective , and while they give some indication about universities , i would never treat them as gospel . 
   do you think the rankings actually favor the schools which mainly provide english instructions and lectures more ? 
  definitely . 
   all other schools in non-english speaking countries , as a matter of fact , are just inferior to the aforementioned universities no . 
  my cousins , having the title [ jonkvrouw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jonkheer ) , were entitled to a my lady , but i just call them by their first names . 
   parijs for paris , berlijn for berlin , keulen for k\u00f6ln elseneur for helsing\u00f8r . 
   uk = / = great britain we just say engeland . 
  i remember that seeing the flag of z\u00fcrich was pretty common when i lived there . 
  also , in friesland , frisian . 
  absolutely not , i think cooperation worldwide is the way to go forward , i would rather see that the us and europe would work together on the right things .
