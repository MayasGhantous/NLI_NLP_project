  the only reason i 've seen people with a permanent contract being fired was because of company downsizing . 
  people have no problem with flying the flag all the time in switzerland , although cantonal flags are even more common than swiss flags .

  i do miss the mountains and lakes of switzerland , the climate and beaches of hawaii and the food of china . 
  from the foundation of the dutch republic there was some religious tolerance , because there were different protestant sects and not a single state religion . 
  the dutch republic guaranteed `` freedom of conscience '' , which meant that nobody could be forced to worship against his or her will . 
  this did n't mean that catholics , jews and the less mainstream protestants were n't discriminated against , for example in government jobs or when building churches/synagogues or other public displays of religion . 
  with the incorporation of the netherlands in france by napoleon , all legal discrimination ended . 
  however , religion had a great impact on daily life until after world war 2 . 
  there was n't a big stigma against atheists before that but church communities were very important still and most people were actively religious in the 1950 's . 
  after that , it gradually but steadily declined . 
   was it forced by state ( eastern bloc ) not in any way .

  the crown princess is still too young to make much of a public impact . 
  i like it a lot , it is the oldest anthem in use and is about our founder and war of independence which is something to be still proud of . 
  [ the wilhelmus at the coronation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkpobge2onu ) .
