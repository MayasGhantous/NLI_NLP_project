  every red dot one the map is one . 
  i hope you become a happy duck soon . 
  it is unclear if they would have been banned if they officially registered as a party or would just have withered away like many small parties that never got any seats . 
  they did n't really exist and they were n't banned : [ partij voor naastenliefde , vrijheid en diversiteit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_for_neighbourly_love,_freedom,_and_diversity ) , commonly known as the pedoparty . 
  they never registered as an official party because they could n't get the required 30 signatures from supporters . 
  they wanted legalization of child pornography and the lowering of the age of consent to age 12 .

  oh yes , we went to france almost every year , camping with two tents in places near bordeaux , the ardeche , the drome , the tarn , the perigord , and mostly near the pont du gard where my aunt lived nearby . 
  great memories , spending days playing in the water , great food at small restaurants , visiting castles , also having a tent blown flat by the mistral . 
  nowadays i go on camping vacation a tent with my wife and kids , to germany , france , belgium , luxembourg , scotland , czech republic and iceland . 
  we love the freedom and flexibility and living outdoors . 
  yes ( faintly ) and no . 
  if they had n't defeated the panzers we would all be pronouncing the name correctly ...

  do n't click on clickbait links . 
  it encourages fake news to attract clicks . 
   nobody in the world speaks dutch after all never underestimate the number of people that * do * speak dutch , for example when traveling form yosemite to bodie in california i met two americans in one day who spoke dutch quite well , a waiter in a roadside restaurant and a park ranger in bodie . 
   do you have any coworkers with `` extreme '' opinions not that i 'm aware of , but these things are more or less private . 
  i had a colleague who was a member of a christian sect which is rather out of the mainstream , but he was a great guy to be around . 
  communist party is legal here , though tiny . 
   is it legal in your country to fire someone for having those sorts of views ? 
  you would have to prove that someone is harassing coworkers , has been officially warned and then persisted in that behavior . 
  it rarely happens . 
  note that christians who were constantly witnessing to their colleagues and refused to stop have been fired . 
  he does :  `` i know what i 'm doing and i listen to a lot of people , i talk to a lot of people and at the appropriate time i 'll tell you who the people are , '' trump said . 
  `` but my primary consultant is myself and i have a good instinct for this stuff . '', 
  i love them , it 's a pity they are rarely worn anymore . 
  a few hundred women till do so on a daily basis . 
  they mostly survived in traditional farming and fishing communities . 
  here are a couple of them : [ volendam ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/21/fa/08/21fa0881d26f54f9c9755443882cd495.jpg ) costume is what foreigners think of as `` dutch traditional '' . 
  so tourists [ get their picture taken in it ] ( http://www.fotoinvolendamkostuum.nl/files/gallery/1415/13.jpg ) . 
  the first minute of [ this movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0mybnf9t_k ) shows volendam in 1945 when such clothes were still commonly worn . 
  [ marken ] ( https://www.jimmynelson.com/media/images/marken/marken%201a.jpg ) is another fishing village and former island . 
  [ the women 's lace caps ] ( https://www.jimmynelson.com/media/images/marken/marken%204.jpg ) are rather subdued for the netherlands . 
  [ staphorst ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eqehdeldriq/tbr7zs9gpui/aaaaaaaasg0/z9koq6yiqsw/s1600/staphorst+200+%25281%2529.jpg ) is widely known as the most religious and conservative town of the netherlands . 
  [ traditional dress is still worn by elderly people ] ( http://i663.photobucket.com/albums/uu358/weblog_rouveen/0202/nieuwjaars-bijeenkomst-zonnebloem-staphorst-4.jpg ) . 
  women in staphorst even decorate [ their bicycles ] ( https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6016/5921467572_44e1cea42c_z.jpg ) in the traditional way . 
  [ spakenburg dress ] ( http://spakenburgse-evenementen.nl/wp-content/gallery/spakenburgse-dagen/spakdag3-18.jpg ) does look a bit weirdbecause of the [ shoulder pad ] ( http://www.museumspakenburg.nl/files/2613/9037/9817/klederdracht.jpg ) . 
  it 's another fishing village , and i sometimes see women in traditional dress from spakenburg selling fish in our local market . 
  [ katwijk ] ( https://ditiskatwijk.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/klederdrachtgroep.jpg ) , yet another fishing village . 
  [ scheveningen ] ( http://www.vlaggetjesdag.com/uploads/tx_templavoila/foto_02.jpg ) on the day the first herring of the season is brought in . 
  scheveningen was once a fishing village in the dunes but is now part of the hague . 
  [ frisian dress ] ( http://www.friesepaardenconcoursen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dummy_visual_02.jpg ) goes well with a sjees ( 2-wheel carriage ) and the magnificent black frisian horses . 
  zeeland province still kept some of its traditional dress . 
  [ zuid beveland ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mhpfcmqmpv4/td31tadygdi/aaaaaaaaani/w2mnliqtmww/s1600/dscn0355.jpg ) has impressive wide lace caps with gold `` oorijzers '' ( ear irons ) . 
  in zuid beveland protestant and catholic dress are different . 
  [ town of axel ] ( https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3284/2650193521_fb1b957516_b.jpg ) [ town of middelburg ] ( https://encyclopedievanzeeland.nl/images/3/33/streekdracht_104977.jpg ), 
  i 've eaten it but found it nothing special . 
  appenzell is the only place in europe that i know where they eat dogs . 
  in the netherlands , we had a lot of local measures . 
  for example , the el was a measure of length , but each town had its own length . 
  often , a steel rod indicating the length of the local el was fastened to a wall in the marketplace for reference . 
  only in 1725 the the hague el ( 69,4 cm ) became a national standard . 
  [ this site lists all local measurements ] ( http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/mgw/ ) of the netherlands . 
  with the introduction of the metric system in 1820 , many of the old measurements were converted to metric ( not accurately , the el was set to 100 cm ) , so the names lingered on . 
  pond ( 500 gram , pre-metric around 480 gram , was set to 1000 gr in 1820 ! ), 
  and ons ( 100 gram , pre-metric about 30 gram ) are still commonly used when shopping ( pound and ounce ! ), 
  my family in law who are farmers still use [ bunder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bunder ) when they mean hectare , morgen is also used . 
  mud is still used and a measurement name for potatoes . 
  `` a dream of red mansions '' by cao xueqin . 
  also known as dream of the red chamber or the story of the stone . 
  merci . 
  and what do you call `` n\u00e8gre en chemise '' these days ? 
  sharing a small apartment between a family with young kids and some freewheeling young men would lead to tensions even if they were from the same country and culture . 
  the kurdish family had one bedroom for the four of them and shared the living room and the kitchen with the somali 's , who were drinking beer and chewing qat all the time . 
  drinking beer during ramadan while the somali 's were supposed to be muslims was very offensive for the kurdish father . 
  the apartment next to ours was rented as accommodation for refugees . 
  a very friendly kurdish family lived there ( dad mom and two young children ) and a couple of young somali men who sold qat , but were never any trouble to us , although sharing the same apartment led to some tension between the kurds and somalis . 
  this was before the recent influx of refugees . 
  edit : an middle-aged guy living on the same floor was a chilean who fled the pinochet regime in the 1970 's . 
  * they remained independent of the ottomans * [ they have a totally kick-ass national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoaqtwrez68 ) * they avoided the worst of the break-up of yugoslavia . 
  netherlands should be your next objective , we have bicycle routes everywhere and great cycling infrastructure . 
  delicious groundwater from the largest forested areas of the netherlands . 
  very little chalk . 
  i grew up next to the chalk area of the netherlands and was used to very hard water as a kid . 
  `` frites '' , `` friet '' or `` patat '' . 
  mayonaise , fritessaus ( mayonaise-like but less fat ) , or joppiesaus . 
  there are only about 40.000 jews left in the netherlands ( of which 9000 are israeli 's ) , so they 're not very common . 
   if you 've met any , what were your opinions of them ? 
  i do n't have any special opinions about jewish people . 
  for example , one of my professors was jewish ( and a holocaust survivor ) but to me he was just another professor . 
  it 's not legal , but possession of small amounts is not prosecuted . 
  the famous weed stores of the netherlands are in a shaky position too , they have no legal way of purchasing their merchandise and weed farms are found and closed all the time by the police . 
  that being said , our police is n't interested in catching drug users , and we even get nice psa 's like [ this ] ( https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-12/3/2/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-20062-1417592403-11.jpg ) . 
  legal weed which is actually a us thing . 
  ( in some states ) . 
  true : we all bicycle . 
  false : we all smoke weed . 
  we have more bicycles than people . 
  and most of the population cycles .
