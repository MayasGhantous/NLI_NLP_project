  while smoking weed is n't rare , there are large parts of society where it is n't accepted . 
  weed use is lower than in many other western countries , including the us . 
  nor is producing and selling weed legal . 
  kellogg 's cereals , and a wide array of sugary muesli-like products , quaker oats among others .

  timber framing is only found in the hill country of south limburg , and they are at least 100 years old , as no new buildings were made using this technique in the 20th century . 
   it 's probably a lot different down south . 
  definitly . 
  [ this is a farm from the part of the netherlands where i live ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/bestand:wageningen-bennekomseweg-boerderij.jpg ) , build around 1805 . 
  this used to be an area with relatively poor farmers so the farms were not very large . 
  in the deep south of the netherlands where i grew up , farms were large buildings with a gate and inner court , looking like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/nuth-maastrichterweg_14_%281%29.jpg ) ( brick and chalkstone ) , [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/schimmert-hoofdstraat_3_%281%29.jpg ) ( mostly chalkstone ) and [ this ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/26346553.jpg ) ( timber framing ) my inlaws from groningen had a large oldamster type farm , build in 1895 after the previous one burned down .

  i mean , no-one would care about the color of a passport or silly stuff like that . 
  no , hard to imagine here . 
  my fathers family lived in the dutch east indies . 
  after the japanese invasion , they were at first confined at home , while my grandfather trained his japanese successor ( he was head engineer of electricity of a sizable town on java ) . 
  then , because my grandfather , like almost all able-bodied white men , had been drafted in the militia , he was sent to a pow camp , and later transported to thailand and burma . 
  he died in 1943 in kinsayok pow camp near hellfire pass while doing forced labor on the burma railroad , and is buried at kachanaburi ( near the famous river kwai bridge ) . 
  his wife with 5 children was sent to a civilian camp , after a year her two sons ( my uncle and my father , 16 and 15 ) were taken away and sent to a boys camp , where they were starved , beaten and has to do field labor by the japanese . 
  my grandmother fell ill in 1944 and was eventually taken to a hospital outside the camp . 
  her eldest daughter could make a few visits and then she died . 
  after the armistice , indonesian insurgents started attacking the prison camps to kill the civilians inside . 
  as part of the capitulation , the japanese were responsible for the safety of the inmates of the camps until they could be reached by allied troops . 
  my father said it was a very weird situation where the guys who had mistreated him for years now bravely defended the camp inmates against the insurgents , some of them getting killed . 
  eventually he and his brother were evacuated and reunited with their sisters . 
  apart from his parents , his grandparents had also died in the japanese camps . 
  mu uncle on mothers side was sent to germany to do forced labor in german factories , there were several bombardments but he survived . 
  my great-uncle avoided being sent to germany by hiding on a farm for two years . 
  we do eat some peanut butter ( we call it peanut cheese ) , but we have much better cheese that the us stuff for our sandwiches , and also [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ctpch2fwy1e/ty6jhm1mgdi/aaaaaaaaaxa/nqi0lbjxbqk/s1600/hagelslag.aisle.jpg ) .

  and my son will spend next year in the asian part of russia . 
  i studied at an university where it was usual to do an internship abroad so i know lots of other people who have lived abroad . 
  you do n't really find that style of chimneys in the netherlands . 
   mailand milan for english speakers . 
  i 've visited all provinces , three of the frisian , all of the zeeland and two of the overseas islands ( which are now states with in the kingdom ) . 
  i have n't been to winterswijk and almere yet , though . 
  yes , in many places and in many sizes . 
  in our system , school level is determined at age 12 , but you can switch to a lower level later , or do a higher level when you are finished . 
  all secondary school levels are also offered for adults . 
  everyone who starts a higher level study before 30 has the right to a very cheap student loan and free public transport . 
  apart from 5 unpleasant years you 've always been a great neighbor , not a rival . 
  well , if someone like that can get through a primary process and win the presidential race it does n't reflect well on the country .

  wageningen , the netherlands . 
   polish people living in holland , they 're treated like immigrants in the worst way this is the cheap workers who are usually shipped in by workers , get housed in cheap accommodation etc. 
  the miners in geleen in my youth , the polish nurse at my mothers care home and students at my university town are treated quite differently . 
  our traditional rivals [ are the british though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-dutch_wars ) .

  i could go to belgium or to germany by bike and be there in like 20 minutes where i grew up in the netherlands . 
  well , i loved [ brotherhood of the wolf ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0237534/ ) . 
  it 's inspired by the events , not a historic movie though . 
  it was in 1988 , so the soviet union still existed . 
   how was it ? 
  leaving from china sounds amazing . 
  it was great fun , i had lived in china for half a year and then made a round trip through with my girlfriend for about a month . 
  doing the transsib had always been a dream and i could get tickets for $ 160 per person beijing to east berlin . 
   did anyone bother you on the trip ? 
  on the contrary , the atmosphere on the train was great , since most people traveled for 5 days together we talked a lot , got the chinese announcer to play our music on the pa system , and even had an impromptu dance party on the corridor once . 
  our chinese conductors were nice guys . 
   are there any terrifying moments out there in no-man 's - land in siberia , there are endless forests , but there is still quite a lot of population along the tracks . 
  and the train had its own radio operator . 
   how was the scenery ? 
  wonderful . 
  first day : china , passing the great wall , and desert-like scenery . 
  on the chinese-mongolian border , the train changes tracks so we had to get out , it was rather festive though with colored lights , music and a bar where you could spend your last chinese money . 
  second day : mongolia , this blew my mind .
