do n't feed the trolls, 
  another one here !, 
  ~ ~ 020 ~ ~ 010 ftw, 
  63 % of all mps , not just tories, 
  [ 63 % of mps already disagree with cameron , chiefly his own party ] ( http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/104869/ ), 
  during pm 's questions , cameron 's fill-in said that the promises made were not official goverment stance , but party promises as made during a election campaign . 
  and we all know [ how well tories keep their election promises . 
  ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/11/pre-election-pledges-tories-are-trying-wipe-internet ), 
  let 's see , shall we ? 
  now let 's see how quickly cameron et al backtrack on the promises they made, 
  a bit late to the party , but here is leiden : [ daylight view ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xc75lta.jpg ) and [ at dusk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fidg1tg.jpg ), 
  besides the quite ugly tweede kamer ( parliament ) , there 's also the dutch eerste kamer ( senate ) , which is must more [ pleasing to look at ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/algemene_politieke_beschouwingen_in_eerste_kamer_\\ ( 10553669036 \\ ) . jpg ), 
  i love me some dune filtered water . 
  translated caption : `` in case it disappears , here 's what it looks like '' :(, 
  [ the girls never came ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=renvytfn820 ), 
  number of french speakers in europe : 77 million number of german speakers in europe : 100 million number of russian speakers in europe : 150 million, 
  just pop in into google translate !, 
  but have you tried their cider ? 
  58 is definitely amsterdam . 
  did n't spot any leiden, 
  well in that case the torrent wo n't be illegal under dutch law . 
  ( although brein will still try to sue/fuck over whoever is downloading ), 
  in dutch law , illegal is defined in this case as a source that does not compensate the copyright holders, 
  yeah , i 've noticed that as well . 
   looketh , there is the tapestry maker . 
  do n't forget that if someone does something illegal using your open wifi network , [ you are also liable to face legal action ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/free-wifi-shortage-german-laws-make-it-hard-to-provide-wireless-internet-a-909288.html ) . 
  you did n't say it , you just heavily implied it . 
  and our justice minister claims he knows people who `` died of cannabis and hashish '', 
  have you corrected for the fact that a lot of muslims in belgium are less wealthy than the average belgian ? 
  this correlates with lower education and higher crime rates . 
  i suspect that poverty is a larger inidicator of criminal tendencies than religion . 
  that 's sad to hear . 
  i was n't aware the ira ( or whatever splinter group ) were still placing bombs . 
  the ira maybe ? 
  although that would n't make sense for 2012, 
  finland , with 2013 's contestant, 
  is azerbaijan buying votes again ? 
  everything was in black & white this year , apparently . 
  more detailed results [ here ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/4to72s6wccyqymh/ecf%20cycling%20barometer%202015%20technical%20document%20final.pdf?dl=0 ) ( pdf via dropbox ) . 
  to me it 's quite strange that denmark was placed above the netherlands , as it 's only better in 2 out of 5 categories . 
  and those categories being imo the least important , namely bicycle sales per capita and membership of ecf affiliated groups . 
  this does n't include the sale of second hand bikes ( which are not to be underestimated ) and the fact that perhaps fewer people in the netherlands are members of a bicycle association because their interests are already taken into account by policy makers . 
  wow , [ one of your pictures ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4ourudj.jpg ) is basically [ the view from my window ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8foxe3a.jpg ) . 
  this is a bit creepy . 
  no , theyre supposedly keeping the same laws in their own bill of rights , the difference being that you ca n't appeal to the european court of human rights when it 's only a british law and not an international treaty . 
  that would be a totum pro parte , and calling the netherlands holland is a pars pro toto . 
  that the first inter-european cooperation involved more countries than just germany and france . 
  it 's archaic , but still used for these kinds of titles . 
  salty canadians, 
   so american mining cooperation newmont set up a shell company with 0 employees in the netherlands and then sued indonesia for regulating their copper concentrate mining . 
  that 's just scary . 
  can i as a private person also sue the state in a private court if they pass legislation i do n't like ? 
  why do corporations get this privilege ? 
  what i 'm saying is that , yes , the death of an animal is * required * for to eat meat , but saying it is necessary for animals to die implies there are no other optioins whatsoever for feeding humans , which is n't true of course . 
   so their death is necessary this is what i have a problem with . 
  it 's required for them to die if you want to eat meat , but it is in no way * necessary * in the grand scheme of things . 
  well then you can agree that eating meat is a choice and animals do n't have to die . 
  and if they do die , that it is needless . 
  if you choose to eat meat , it implies there is another option . 
  therefore meat eating is not a must and animals do n't * need * to die . 
  they die because you want them to . 
  it 's all called windmill in dutch though, 
   yes but a classic mill grinds stuff . 
  not true , mills can also saw or pump, 
  that 's a very rare pepe in the wild, 
  someone is salty, 
  a ban is an executive decision . 
  the russian singer can appeal to the ukrainian courts if she wants to, 
  if you ca n't manage $ 10000 you ca n't get 70000 votes either, 
  with so many parties , people actually believe they can make a choice, 
  troll and fake, 
  polish flag is white-red , not red-white . 
  this is either monaco or indonesia, 
  yeah i could 've worded it more cleary, 
  correct , but neither an embassey nor a consulate is foreign soil, 
  no , no diplomatic missions are foreign soil . 
  the host country just has limited/no jurisidiction inside the embassey, 
   moroccans are better at being a member of netherland society than turks could ever be . 
  please go away, 
  erdogan wants to change the turkish constitution to give the president ( himself ) more powers . 
  to change the constitution he needs to hold a referendum . 
  you can have our limburg, 
  [ ahem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three-fifths_compromise ), 
  nrw citizens will only count for 3/5 of a dutch citizen, 
  of course , we visit the glorious [ waddeneilanden ] ( http://www.travelvalley.nl/uploads/headers/waddeneilanden.jpg ), 
  that 's scary, 
  saudi arabia ? 
  that 's hard to do when making political jokes, 
   however , their job has mostly been taken by more modern `` gemalen '' that work on electricity . 
  in an emergency windmills are still often called upon . 
  electric pumps have the advantage of being to pump continously , regardless of the wind . 
  but they pump at a lower rate . 
  when there 's been torrential rainfall , the [ windmills often help with pumping out the excess water ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxe9m-k90ja ), 
  guess where i 'm going on holiday :'(, 
  i think any political assassination could be seen as terrorism, 
  how are those mutually exclusive ? 
  too late for that , now that article 50 has been triggered, 
  is there anywhere i can see who voted in favour of acta ? 
  sure , but you 're not not paying taxes, 
  everyone pays taxes .
