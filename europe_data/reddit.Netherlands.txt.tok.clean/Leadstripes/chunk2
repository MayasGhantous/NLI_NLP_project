  you pay vat over everything you buy, 
   how would you see the freeway though ? 
  why would i want to look at cars stuck in a jam ? 
  if the news just says there is a jam , i get the picture, 
  the first step of what exactly ? 
  something like [ this ? 
  ] ( http://cdn-static.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeek/files/2015/11/henry_5.jpg ), 
  i would n't count freek `` dieren !! '', 
  vonk as an intellectual though, 
   or [ do not ] cultivate it ** themselves **, 
  hire people to do it for you ? 
   a bunch of peasants , farmers , a few college grads and the french army and navy , while the british were otherwise engaged with the spanish and dutch ftfy, 
  ppp , although that has its caveats too, 
   or a person with absolutely no concept of money so that they 're perhaps less likely to be influenced by money ? 
  i find this concept very unlikely, 
  average ( not mean ) personal capital per capita is a very bad way to compare wealth between countries . 
  it does n't take into account the differences in taxes , public services , pension schemes , et cetera . 
  seeing this , i 'm so glad the french revolution came to the netherlands, 
  what about ede-wageningen ^ ^ hehehe, 
  you 're to have a fun week of sitting in airports, 
  you 're more likely to die driving on the way to the airport then from a terrorist attack, 
  maaskantje is only three streets or something, 
  veganism and vegeterianism is centuries ( or even millennia ) old . 
  after all , chips and crisps are vegan . 
  according some guesses , between 0,25 % and 1 % of dutch people are vegan . 
  it 's not that big , but in the past few years it 's been growing steadily . 
  [ the vegetarian butcher ] ( https://www.devegetarischeslager.nl/serverspecific/dvs/cache/img/ea54c5c28c352a901e446cc2d6db94dad41d72b4/jaap_slagersmes.jpg ) is our lord and saviour, 
  the republic did n't always use the prinsevlag . 
  it was about 50/50 red or orange, 
  veendam of course . 
  there 's two who stand out for me . 
  the first is spinvis , a musician who makes quite artsy music , sometimes [ happy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3ztrgwslf4 ) , sometimes more [ melancholical ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c4ubgbqyyc ) the other is eefje de visser , a singer songwriter . 
  [ scheef ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wxmkk8wure ) is probably her best song , the way it builds and mixes accoustic guitars with synthesizers . 
  you forgot c1000 . 
  i 'd put it with dirk, 
  you think british tap water tastes good ? 
  to me , it 's one of the more nasty kinds of water i 've tasted, 
  also , it cites the daily mail as a source . 
  come on . 
  it compares violent crime per capita between the us and the uk , but does n't mention that `` violent crime '' has a broader definition in the uk . 
  this artificially inflates the statistics , makes the uk look unsafer than it is and is intellectually dishonest, 
  your source is obviously biased . 
  for example , it obfuscates the difference in definition of violent crime in the uk and us to make the uk seem more violent . 
  and fox news is fair and balanced too !, 
   if someone comes in and starts indiscriminately shooting jesus , what kind of world do you live in that this is an occurance you plan for ? 
  i 'd rather lose my wallet then try to be a hero and gamble with my own life and the lives of other people . 
  are you so scared that you feel the need to carry a gun everywhere ? 
  that 's what would happen in an ideal world . 
  but then again , you would n't get robbed or get into a fight in an ideal world . 
  says the person quoting nothing but anecdotal evidence . 
  they cite their sources . 
  for example , the statistic above comes from the peer reviewed study : linda e. saltzman , et al. , weapon involvement and injury outcomes in family and intimate assaults , 267 jama , 3043-3047 ( 1992 ) . 
  but you could also read susan b. sorenson , firearm use in intimate partner violence : a brief overview , in 30 evaluation review , a journal of applied social research , special issue : intimate partner violence and firearms , 229 , 232-33 ( susan b. sorenson ed. , 2006 ) , or susan b. sorenson et al. , weapons in the lives of battered women , 94 am . 
  health 1412 , 1413 ( 2004 ) . 
  http://smartgunlaws.org/domestic-violence-and-firearms-statistics/  domestic violence assaults involving a firearm are 12 times more likely to result in death than those involving other weapons or bodily force . 
  exactly this . 
   i have never heard of such a situation . 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  you said `` carrying a gun helped a lot of people '' . 
  what i want to know is how many people were n't helped ? 
  how many people made things worse by starting some kind of shootout ? 
  i do n't buy the whole `` the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun '' nonsense, 
   people who carry are n't stupid . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  and what about the other side of the coin ? 
  how many people exacerbate things by brandishing a gun ? 
  the problem is not crime . 
  if people have a gun around the house , they are likely to use it when they get into a domestic argument . 
  if they carry a gun with them , they 're likely to take it out when they get angry in traffic . 
  those are the situations you can avoid with strict gun legislation, 
  that 's nice in theory . 
  does it hold up in real life ? 
   an idiot who wants to walk around with a gun will do so sure , but the number of people with a gun and the number of guns in circulation will be far , far , far lower . 
  i think the current dutch laws are fine . 
  it allows for people to shoot for sport , but does n't let any idiot walk about with a gun . 
  i would n't want to own a gun . 
  i have an electrolux ewt1262edw , which is 90x40x65 cm, 
  that 's amsterdam, 
  i would 've like to have seen gl a bit bigger and vvd/cda a bit smaller . 
  groenlinks has the biggest gain compared to 2012 but still is n't that big, 
  liberal as in classic liberal or liberal as in left wing/progressive ? 
  rutte basically says ` leave it to the free market lol ', 
  ignore all climate issues, 
  do n't forget [ korfbal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korfball#world_championship ), 
  so it 's more a case of failing government ? 
  what does this have to do with migration ? 
  no if you want to do a second bachelor 's or master 's degree next to the one you already have . 
   it is hard to believe that an event that almost shuts down the country ( 175 million unique views ) can be something people barely think about . 
  the world is a whole lot bigger than the usa, 
  i do n't really think anything of it at all . 
  i 'd rather watch the six nations rugby tournament, 
  shh , do n't tell the belgians,

  as long as we get a better flag than [ the current benelux monstrosity ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/flag_of_benelux.svg/220px-flag_of_benelux.svg.png ), 
  yeah , but most of those extremely long bridges are rather simple constructions on flat terrain . 
  that 's something else than building a bridge over a 300m + deep strait,

  from around 1900 , do n't know the exact year, 
  the dutch national museum of natural history is in leiden , so they did a whole range of [ promotional videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hxh0cd3od8 ) based on the new t. rex fossil that 's been added to the museum .
