  so now there 's a video of the t. rex visiting the [ museum of antiquities ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmqptddhje ) , [ the botanical garden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffp2qn8frgs ) and [ the museum of anthropology ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbut34ovsrk ) edit : there was also [ this timelapse video ] ( https://vimeo.com/110127217 ) that 's been used by the local tourist board , i think, 
  of course it 's expensive . 
  its barcelona vs. real madrid . 
  erno , is that you ? 
  99,999 % of people wo n't have heard of him , including me, 
  italy and germany are not in the same region, 
  is it me , or does he look like terry gilliam ? 
  the bicycle, 
  that 's only for people whose parents are unknown or of unknown nationality . 
  i ca n't wait for the 50plus electorate to die out, 
  no , what you want is for someone to confirm your delusions . 
  you already know what answer you want , but are unsatisfied when the truth turns out to be different than what you thought it was . 
  key word here is habitually . 
  an american friend had some . 
  i tasted it . 
  it was vile . 
   let 's agree to disagree i tought you wanted advice , but when people tell you you are wrong about * their * countries , you apparently know what 's going on there better then the people living there ? 
  just stay away from the daily sharia patrols and you 'll be fine . 
  their times should be clearly signposted everywhere . 
  this is some / r/iamverysmart material right here, 
  i think the only area we do still mix is in literature . 
  flemish authors such as dimitri verhulst , herman brusselmans , lize spit or older ones like louis paul boon or hugo claus are very popular in the netherlands . 
  i assume dutch writers are also widely read in flanders ? 
  you just come across as some kind of overly nationalistic , daily mail reading , small minded leave-voter . 
  the embodiment of everything people loathe about brits . 
  edit : also reagonomics does n't work and i 'm glad thatcher 's dead . 
   my hero maggie  our brave lads  thatcherism , reaganomics , good times these stand out , but basically everything you said . 
  is this satire ? 
  bags : twinings loose tea : something from my [ lovely local tea store ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fpvmn2z.jpg ), 
  probably argentina , chile , canada or new zealand, 
   hopefully the eu will have job-placement services ( like the `` workforce centers '' back home ) who could match me to jobs that aspies are known to thrive in . 
  if you want to live here , you 'll either have to come here as a student or have a job lined up . 
  you ca n't come here and just expect a job being handed to you, 
  jesus , you 're a cunt, 
  it 's ok to help someone , you 're just acting like a wanker, 
  please do n't come to europe . 
  by foreign i mean `` not of the host nation '' , the host nation in this case being european and therefore not the us . 
  also , fuck you , you condescending wanker, 
  edited, 
   would technically not lie when i say that `` i 'm still on us soil except you would , because a diplomatic mission is not foreign soil edited for legibility, 
  well , looks like op is fucked then, 
  doing a great job in iraq and afghanistan !, 
  it has to be [ purno de purno ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aj_p1cd65y ), 
  lack of economic motivation ? 
  as i understand calabria is n't exactly an economic powerhouse . 
  but all that aside , think it would be quite feasible to build . 
  the \u00d8resund bridge is quite a bit longer, 
   bayern  liked by most germans pick one, 
  or [ 10191 ] ( https://youtu.be/vz2nfvc8wmw?t=36 ), 
  or maybe an [ ecoduct ] ( http://apt46.net/wp-content/upload/ecoduct-veluwe.jpg ) ? 
  well henk , the thing about a free and open society is that you come in contact with ideas that you do n't agree with . 
  i suggest you get used to it, 
  it 's a tourist trap , as is the heineken brewery, 
  at this point it has almost become performance art . 
  not everyone who disagrees with you is a troll or an american hiding behind a european flag . 
  `` someone disagrees with me , they must be crazy ! '', 
  but calling scotland a country is not exclusive to scottish nationalists . 
  literally everyone in the uk calls scotland , england and wales countries , even those who oppose scottish independence . 
  edit : and again , stop downvoting me just because you disagree with me . 
   because this is such a taboo subject among scots this is complete bullshit . 
  scottish nationalism and independence are widely discussed in public in scotland and the rest of the uk . 
  also , stop downvoting anything you do n't agree with automatically . 
  i think it 's more of a chronic condition, 
  that 's your interpretation and i 'm sure a lot of people do n't agree with it, 
  you do n't actually read anything i say so it 's rather pointless to reply , but / u/panceltic put it like this :  it is a hot topic because they have hard feelings for historical reasons , a recent referendum , present political system is n't ideal , they feel dictated by westminster , but also their mps can make life miserable for the english & welsh . 
  i have n't run out of arguments , you just seem to be unable to read what i 'm saying . 
  that 's why i made it extra big so even you could read it, 
  no , because : ** every person in the uk would call england , scotland and wales countries **, 
  do you have difficulties reading ? 
  i already addressed your question . 
   if scots are moreso offended by your silly remarks that scotland is a province it 's probably due to the scottish independence movement . 
  i 've said it before : ** every person in the uk would call england , scotland and wales countries ** if scots are moreso offended by your silly remarks that scotland is a province it 's probably due to the scottish independence movement . 
   we call these entities here in the netherlands provinces , not countries o_o other countries are different from the netherlands . 
  not everything in the world is exactly like it is in the netherlands . 
  other countries might be different or do things differently . 
  maybe you 'd learn this if you ever left twente . 
  oh piss off . 
  whenever some disagrees with you , you start saying `` you are not rational '' or `` are you secretly american ? 
  because you are behaving very stupidly '' . 
  know when to admit you 're wrong henk , this is just pathetic . 
  i 'm not avoiding your question . 
  i 'm saying the statement that `` why are only scotish people reacting like it is important '' is complete bullshit because 99,9 % of * all * british people would call england , scotland and wales countries . 
  from wikipedia :  england is a country that is part of the united kingdom  scotland is a country that is part of the united kingdom  wales is a country that is part of the united kingdom, 
  not everything in the world is like the netherlands . 
  just because the netherlands have subdivisions called provinces does n't mean every subdivision of every country is called a province . 
  oops , 
   i have never heared a english person say this then you should take to more english people , because they definitely do say so . 
  literally every english person would say that england is a country . 
  it 's homecounties , not homecountries . 
  county \u2260 country . 
  also , noone is claiming that england and scotland are n't subdivisions of the uk , just that they are also countries in their own right , albeit not sovereign . 
   you could be hiding behind a flair , creating a different identity to hide the fact that you are a us citizen . 
  your ideas would hint to this though . 
  henk , you 're being downvoted by everyone on this sub . 
  it 's not just / u/panceltic that thinks the subdivisions are called countries , it 's everyone except for you . 
  just look at the history of the uk , they were independent countries that came together in a way and formed a new independent super-country , while still retaining the characteristics of the constituent countries . 
  finally , calling people americans because they disagree with you only makes you look silly . 
  noone is claiming scotland and england are independent countries , but they are countries none the less . 
  the `` provinces '' ( as you would call them ) that make up germany are also called bundes ** l\u00e4nder **, 
   why are only inhabitants of scotland calling their province a country ?
