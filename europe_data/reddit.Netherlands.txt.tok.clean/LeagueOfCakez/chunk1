it 's mindgames , i can feel it, 
  it 's okay , i 'll join in . 
  i 've been stared at more than a bit bizarrely because i used to be really short for the majority of my high school years , you do n't see me killing innocents with a kalashnikov while chanting in the capital thinking i 'm doing something right . 
  this is not the reason you 're looking for . 
   slovenians the tallest triggered, 
  they do have a point , flaunting wealth is generally frowned upon and not purchasing things on discount is heresy , iirc it stems from calvinism but do n't quote me on that . 
  as far as scandinavia is concerned , i honestly do not know why it would be much more if any more expensive than the netherlands to live in . 
  belgian bashing day is every day here in the netherlands , there is a humor category dedicated to them . 
  the belgians in turn do the same to the netherlands . 
  the dutch usually joke about the belgians intelligence the belgians usually joke about the dutch stinginess, 
  and belgium is n't ugly compared to the netherlands but the sort of person that googles in dutch , especially on foreign matters , is far from the average person in the netherlands as nearly all of us just google in english . 
  i often come across heavy regional dialect too when searching in dutch and only typing in 1-2 words . 
  so take these results with a grain of salt , also the reason why so many countries do n't provide any results personally i would n't know which country is more `` expensive '' though i 'd love to visit someday . 
  did not seem to garner any results for quite a lot of nations sadly , i guess there 's not a lot of googling in the native language here . 
  p.s : [ sorry belgium ] ( https://gyazo.com/74b6233938c72ab1d598e64384e95366.png ) forgot luxembourg , it gave : `` why is luxembourg rich ? '',

  you are now banned from / r/cirkeltrek, 
  my uncle is one of those people and has even been on the radio to preach that shit . 
  i was the only one in the family who seemed to be ashamed of him , and i was 13-14 at the time . 
  it 's extremely sad . 
  especially with wilders promoting that bull too , and his blindly following fanbase, 
  i 'm down , but what if we call it the salmiakki union . 
  united through the power of the worlds only good licorice . 
  it 's like 50/50 i think but almost always right next to each other , they are usually posted on the dutch subreddits whenever we are one rank ahead and celebrated with bitterballen, 
  `` anything that i do not like i distance from myself so my precious snowflake ego is unharmed '' is generally their train of thought, 
  i 'll start practicing squatting on various objects right now , comrade, 
  [ what do i win ] ( http://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/3d_indy.jpg ), 
  leave it to the american to bring a gun to a knife fight , damn , you win hands down . 
  same ... 
  not at all . . in the slightest, 
  the only reason i clicked tbh, 
  you can border the netherlands if you wish , but we have to talk about your ways of putting milk in plastic bags first . 
  i 'm down, 
  can we get there by caravan ? 
  asking for a friends country ** edit : ** oh and do you serve bitterballen ? 
  it 's like saying we 're the worst at not being dutch , well gee whiz . 
  no nazi propaganda in sight , -20 / 10, 
  not just that sound , but almost every other vowel combination sounded german to me . 
  the `` r '' was one of the most similar to dutch ( some even sounded perfect ), 
  which is funny because this sounded like textbook heavy german accent to me with very few nordic sounds . 
  i see , that meaning totally slipped past me then ( maybe because of the amount of people brigading that actually say stuff like that ) he definitely claims he is left yes , whether that 's really true is up for debate . 
  ( feels more like hes a right-winger cheering for the other `` team '' than the dutch right-wing ), 
  the people who voted for him were turks . 
  nobody else agrees with denk , but please continue to live in your fantasy bubble where there 's only a black and white vision on the world '' ; ) '' i voted center-left and i hate this guy more than wilders . 
  or does it say something about you ? 
  no no , its the millions of educated people from secular and unbiased universities that are wrong . 
  are we talking about gert-jan segers the one who lived in egypt for 7 years ? 
  you 'll be in for a disappointment then , especially when being first does not matter for the pvv unless they get 76 minimum . 
  dutch short word for `` mobile unit '' basically a riot police unit, 
  suck it suomi !, 
  also this statistic is for a minimum of 30 minutes of exercise per day for at least 5 days per week ( so 2.5 hrs minimum ) so it may be a little higher still . 
  then again it could also be lowered due to people pretending they fulfilled the requirements but actually didnt . 
  for anyone curious on the netherlands https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/17/ruim-helft-nederlanders-sport-wekelijks 56 % in 2014, 
  i live near amsterdam and can honestly say the food in amsterdam has never been nowhere as good as the neighbouring towns to me . 
  i am honestly surprised to hear someone likes the food from amsterdam . 
  especially anything deepfried or the typical dutch foods like stroopwafels and cheese taste like ass to me . 
  / r/the _ klaver / is leaking again, 
  it was just `` vrij '' where i 'm from ( slightly north of amsterdam ) never heard of `` buut '' or `` buutvrij '' in my life . 
  40.000 here and a village as well , though it has a way different vibe than the 40.000 inhabitants official city right below . 
  i always assumed it was inspired by dutch and danish just with an english accent, 
  as far as im concerned the largest amount of sunburns from the dutch is being ignorant about sunblock while vacationing in southern europe or visiting tanning salons / owning tanning beds . 
  so i 'd say wealth and lack of fucks contributes just as much if not more . 
  also likely the reason eastern europe is n't in the red despite having the same skin tone . 
  life expectancy may play a minor role aswell . 
  i mean that 's common knowledge but why the 11 years specifically . 
  i do n't think it does or am i missing a joke here, 
  we lick eyeballs in the netherlands rather than shaking hands . 
  we will build a wall !, 
  but there is one place where you could get that sweet extra 1 % * cough *, 
  ca n't get flatter than spirit level , i object . 
  - gemoedelijkheid - leedvermaak - ( no dutch translation ) - tijdgeest we got 3 out of 4 it seems , all but sehnsucht, 
  bad bot, 
  suck it finland !, 
  or maybe , a little less . 
  https://youtu.be/pthavajdxo8 i am proud to get the reference, 
  as for abortions i think the problem with privatizing them like you said is not so much that the parents are screwed ( pun not intended ) but the children they bear might just get tossed into a bush or a river or are taken care of extremely poorly / put up for adoption which creates more trouble than it currently does where people abuse the current abortion system . 
  that guy 's comment history is a redneck yank goldmine ,  climate change is propaganda made by the air cooling companies in order to sell their product more and by the environmentalists to gain more influence . '', 
  appreciate those mountains , make love with those mountains , for some of us are n't as fortunate . 
  i have never seen a hill over 26 meters . 
  can confirm , living under sea level near the coast . 
  ahh , fair enough, 
  that subreddit is 16x smaller per capita than / r/thenetherlands though , while existing for far longer . 
  would n't really say it can be grouped with that one . 
  oh til , thanks : , 
  i remember something like that as childrens drinks but not as soft drinks , isnt soft drinks exclusively carbonated water with flavoring ? 
  would n't that be sisi or hero then ? 
  never heard of `` wicky '', 
  you had to make a throwaway to make these kinds of comments ? 
  man that 's just sad . 
  but muh agenda : c, 
  need poldering ? 
  got ta agree , but i do n't mind proper wall art . 
  but the vast majority of graffiti is just a bunch of edgy teens who can barely write spraying their shitty little `` tags '' that just consist of their initials or their angsty self-proclaimed nicknames with the motor skills of a 5 year old . 
  most definitely flemish only . 
  https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/lijst_van_heuvels_in_nederland#lager_dan_50_meter according to our list of hills , the lowest hill we call a mountain is 6.4 meters although it was artificially made , and the lowest natural hill we call a mountain is 14.2 meters .
