  ah but do you actually watch non english content ? 
  especially westerns are very silly in german : `` h\u00e4nde hoch john !, 
  no other way around . 
  our billion is 1000 * theirs . 
  i think it 's sweet . 
  the dude just needs some practice . 
  austerity is n't working for the lenders either , because collapse of demand from the borrowers . 
  the international ns website is here : http://www.nshispeed.nl/nl/internationale-treinplanner, 
  from hoek van holland [ stena lines ] ( http://www.stenaline.co.uk/ferry/routes/harwich-holland/fares/ ) have various destinations in the uk . 
  it takes longer than the oostende route because you spend more time at sea . 
  if you are not in a hurry it may be an option . 
  a low budget option is the eurolines bus that takes the oostende ferry . 
  for about 54euro may ask extra for the bikes . 
  edit : ( http://www.eurolines.nl/ ), 
  from nl : [ leonard huizinga ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/leonhard_huizinga ) who wrote the most hilarious stories about the twins [ adrian and oliver ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/adriaan_en_olivier ) who fortunately always get rescued by their uncles butler , who brings the champaign while at it . 
  i think this could be smart move . 
  do the greeks want to go back to their drachma ? 
  probably not . 
  think about getting a pension in drachma versus in euros . 
  they need to get their economy running again , do not want to leave the euro . 
  nz and australia have the same issue . 
  klinging to left driving in a metric system . 
  and what about those cda ladies . 
  pff grow up . 
  china want to move their people up on the prosperity ladder . 
  it is already an interesting market for western car manufacturers . 
  india wants to do the same , however it seems less well run . 
  so they may take longer to start buying significant numbers of mercs . 
  i think in the long run it 's a good thing china and india are moving up the food chain . 
  in the mean time we will just have grow our gdp 's to stay competitive by innovating etc. 
  i do n't see any reason why norway would n't be able to maintain a sweden like level of prosperity when the oil runs out . 
  i never heard of that paying only interest on the lone trick . 
  i 'm not sure it exists in nl . 
  perhaps an idea for spain . 
  you postpone paying down your loan until the economy turns around . 
  in my view globalisation is unavoidable because transportation and communication have become very cheap and sophisticated . 
  you may tell those corporations that they have to produce shit in norway , but if a cheaper shoe is imported from turkey the corporation goes bankrupt anyway and stops producing shoes . 
  the only ( hypothetical ) solution is to ban all imports , but that is not realistic because norway is too dependant on shit produced elsewhere , like christmas butter and volvo 's and nokia 's and pentiums . 
  in nl however all moveable labour intensive production has left the country a long time ago . 
  yet our economy is ok . we moved on to doing other shit . 
  services services services and a bit high tech . 
  it 's the low tax rates that attract prostitutes from the region to commute there . 
  check out finland and sweden though . 
  it 's not in the default set . 
  during our golden age we had state condoned pirates , to capture the spanish gold from latin america , matey . 
  this time we just need an a for our rating . 
  guess where that 's coming from . 
  this low tax scheme attracts business from the surrounding regions . 
  still a bit naughty i would say . 
  i am not aware of austrian passenger cars . 
  are they volkswagens produced in austria ? 
  so either they are so rich that they do n't care about energy conservation , or they use their energy so well , that it makes them rich . 
  other parties not involved in the trade may be harmed . 
  for example african fisherman selling their fish to europe because they get a better price , while their country men go hungry . 
  what 's up with luxembourg ? 
  i 'm not joking . 
  your bankers are 32.43 % more happier than the german ones . 
  but you have happy bankers !, 
  to keep things as they are !, 
  sorry here 's the first page : [ first ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,822981,00.html ) the wish-wash stuff is actually a sort of vision , that many could agree with . 
  i 'd call him social-liberal . 
  not conservative . 
  conservative is about what you think on ethical issues . 
  abortion / gays etc. 
  this dude for president !, 
  the sgp do n't even allow women to be elected . 
  of course they are neanderthals . 
   the other thing is that those `` right wing '' parties are lately becoming  almost indistinguishable from `` left wing '' , especially in economic matters . 
  what do you mean with this ? 
  the left embraced keynesian style policies , i think , while the right embraced `` austerity '' . 
  that is a shame . 
  this festival is the only event i have ever returned to in my vacationing history . 
  change your plans . 
  [ here is act from 2011 edition . 
  germanies east is still catching up . 
  they have good growth numbers . 
  here 's anothet list : [ gdp ( ppp ) per capita per hour worked ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_hour_worked ) . 
  we ( nl ) are the laziest !, 
  note how greece droppes from 4th in 2005 to 24th in 2009 . 
  [ chalon dans la rue ] ( http://www.chalondanslarue.com/ ) is a great street theatre festival . 
  close to dyon . 
  if this tax is similar ( percentage wise ) to the uk stamp duty it should be ok . 
  disagree the financial sector is under taxed , because of their tendency to work around the tax system . 
  the only way to raise the taxes is for a large part of the world to synchronize their taxes . 
  aha : [ shares and bonds would be taxed at a rate of 0.1 % and derivative contracts , at a rate of 0.01 % ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/pressreleasesaction.do?reference=ip/11/1085&amp;format=html&amp;aged=0&amp;language=en&amp;guilanguage=en ) . 
  now what qualifies as `` derivative contracts '' ? 
  i think the stamp duty only applies to stock trading , while the proposed transaction tax is much broader , covering for example currency trading . 
  upvote for boudewijn downvote for guus . 
  who came up with the `` compact '' term ? 
  i suspect our president mispronounced something and it stuck . 
  this one : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17108367 ? 
  funny how funny these things work out sometimes . 
  ** de ** ) dutch ... passion aww . 
  that 's just the sweetest google suggestion ever . 
  thank you . de . 
  to retaliate i typed `` americans '' on the dutch version and it suggested ( among a few others ) : + americans think obama is a cactus and if i type `` americans are '' it suggest : + ... stupid + ... fat + ... not stupid, 
  their ethics code of probably does n't allow discussing specific cases . 
  did i ever mention we should kick goldman sachs out of the eu . 
  he 's pointing out that greece 's economy is still not competitive without widespread wage cuts . 
  this will take ages to settle without the being able to lower your exchangerate .
