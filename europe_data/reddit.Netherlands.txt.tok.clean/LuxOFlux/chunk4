  the list of current mep \u00b4 s is on wikepedia too : here \u00b4 s the dutch one : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netherlands_ ( european_parliament_constituency ) #current _ meps, 
   in the u.s.a. , for example , 200 + years of `` interpretation '' of the constitution have led to the negation of most of the rights specifically mentioned in the consititution . 
  do you have an example of this ? 
  the beatles ? 
  indeed !, 
  but we have to be carefull with our current governments neo-con tendencies like giving tax cuts for pretending to matter . 
  was n't there a megnetolev train in germany that goes faster than 320km/h ? 
  yes , i would say so . 
  we carry the same cultural heritage . 
  if you read the enlightenment wikipedia page you see that developments in different european countries influence each other , resulting in `` the enlightenment '' being a european phenomenon . 
  the us electing leaders who think scientists ca n't read thermometers , is a huge setback for enlightenment though . 
  for me it is the part of the world that went through the [ enlightenment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_enlightenment ) . 
  yes , but makes you think the rest could perhaps be accelerated too .

  in the mean time nl has gone completely senseo with the pads . 
  there are still high practical barriers like learning a new language . 
  since it is open source the gov could hire somebody to fix any problems . 
  also if government requires open file format standards then ms office doesn \u00b4 t come with dose . 
  in the long run it is much cheaper, 
  what does dispersion rate and nuts2 & nuts3 mean here ? 
  if you are referring to the tobin tax , i think that was never seriously suggested . 
  rather equal regulations ( a level playing field ) for the financial sector however . 
  completely in line with tories free market ideals . 
  pfoei !, 
  behave . 
  he just keeps repeating how important our finance sector is for nl . 
  if he could bring a bit of city to amsterdam he would . 
  i suspect he has a **** ** for the financial sector in amsterdam . 
  the tobin tax should decrease currency speculation .

  not yet i think but the climb in interest rate , caused some cooperation . 
  the financial markets gave them a push . 
  you kicked the scots asses so they would join , you mean ? 
  [ looks like you have a coalition now jonne . 
  and apparently next week belgium needs to collect money on the fin market . 
  now the interest rates will be higher . 
  great lyrics . 
  also from nl : [ spinvis - wespen op de appeltaart ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3ztrgwslf4\u00e0 ) on behalf belgium i submit [ yevgueni - als ze lacht ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiphez0vb7k ) and on behalf of antwerp [ katastroof - afscheid ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwa5gjiaa5c ), 
  crap is everywhere unfortunately . 
  i heard this song on the radio yesterday , but googling zaas and saas delevered nothing . 
  fortunately on the website of the radio-channel they have a playlist . 
  tada . 
  i \u00b4 ll check out your ladies too , but later . 
  ja ah well , most of these stats are dated pre banking problem it seems . 
  in belgium a lot of the municipalities are shareholders in dexia and bank at dexia . 
  antwerp alone will loose 140 million euri in shares value if dexia is nationalised without a compensation plan for the shareholders . 
  i think for the belgian part there will be some compensation plan when in the future dexia returns to sthe stock market . 
  this is speculation on my behalf . 
  i have no hard info at the moment . 
  thanks for the summary . 
  keep those gdp \u00b4 s growing !, 
  i agree about the speculators . 
  however banks hold savings from real people . 
  you will end up baling out your local banks anyway , if some run into problems after greece \u00b4 s default . 
  do you think that greek salary number is realistic ? 
  hrrm comix you mean .
