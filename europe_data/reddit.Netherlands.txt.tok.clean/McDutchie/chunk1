what a language . 
  [ quite ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1edpxkqiptw&amp;t=34s ) . 
  the families forcing the veil are not going to stop forcing it because of this ban . 
  the only effect is that now it 's even harder for these women to leave the house . 
  the government is colluding with their families to keep them indoors and out of public view . 
  as if oppression goes away by hiding it . 
  you 're making boring sound really good . 
  everything will be eventually disappear and be forgotten , therefore by your logic everything is pointless . 
  you 're making a ridiculous argument . 
  that may be , but this reddit meme of calling anything beautiful `` porn '' is fucking moronic . 
  the only sensible response in this thread , and it 's all the way at the bottom . 
  i 'm in nl and this seems like nonsense to me . 
  i 've never heard of such a rule and ca n't find any references to it on google . 
  get with the program , these days it 's muslims we 're supposed to hate . 
  maybe it 's ironic , but it 's certainly appropriate . 
  `` we have only one thing to fear and that is fear itself . '', 
  itt : the usual / r/europe racists advocating ethnic cleansing , genocide , etc. 
  on the roma culture because one roma committed the sort of crime that has been committed in every other ethnicity in existence as well . 
   smokers pay more in taxes than they cost in health care provision source ? 
   second hand smoking does n't kill false . 
  there is [ a lot of evidence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=passive_smoking&amp;oldid=570687480#evidence ) that it does . 
  ( yeah , it 's a wikipedia link . 
  follow the references , they are solid . ), 
   raising taxes on tobacco will only drive more people to black market tobacco , funny . 
  the pro-cannabis argument is always that the black market will disappear as soon as cannabis is legalized , regulated and taxed . 
   the biggest challenge coming in the next few decades to healthcare systems will be dealing with people living longer , not shorter and they live longer because ... ? 
  i 'm sure that the fact that fewer and fewer people are smoking is purely coincidental . 
   it 's none of their business what others choose to do with their body . 
  do n't like the smell of smoke ? 
  do n't stand beside someone smoking , to make that possible , kindly keep your stinking , cancerous smoke out of public places . 
   til tyrkisk peber is danish . 
  but why do the danes claim it 's turkish ? 
   if anybody can decipher this idiocy , i would be very grateful . 
  here 's an attempt : `` i have to be seen as * doing something * to save face and make sure the mindless plebeians keep voting for me and my bosses/protectors . '', 
   plus associate membership in cfsp ala norway ( again everyone 's interests ) . 
  so , just like norway , britain will still have to follow all the eu 's rules just like they do now , except they 'll have relinquished the opportunity to have a say in them . 
  * edit : * typo, 
  it 's similar in sweden . 
  the most common names are the patronymics ending in - son , but there are tons of last names like stenstr\u00f6m ( stoney stream ) , ekblad ( oak leaf ) , lindgren ( linden branch ) , etc. 
    city who had a massive  city * which or ( better ) : city * that ( [ source ] ( http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/which.htm ) ), 
  most of us do n't know it , but william actually sings that he 's of dutch ( teutonic ) blood . 
  in 1570 , when it was written , the word `` duytsch '' did not mean the same thing as the modern `` duits '' . 
  this is why we 're still called dutch in english . 
  presumably op meant ` successful ' . 
  the fucking rioters are to blame . 
  stop making excuses for criminals . 
  what do you mean by `` latin sphere '' ? 
  hungarian is a finno-ugric language , not latin ( romance ) . 
   the fact is that the average german has virtually nothing in common with the average romanian or the average portugese . 
  this is just wrong . 
  there are many more similarities between european peoples than there are differences . 
  the continent has a shared history that goes back over 2000 years . 
  the languages of europe are all related and they share so many words of common origin that you can make a whole language out of just those common words . 
  culturally most of europe is based on christianity . 
  there are many shared values , such as the notion that there should be a decent social security and health care system subsidized by the government . 
  if you want to experience just how similar europeans are to each other , try visiting a country that is actually very different , such as china , or even the united states . 
  also , what are you on about with regards to americans not knowing what happens with multi-ethnic countries ? 
  america has been a multi-ethnic country from the very beginning , so if anyone would know , it would be them . 
  europe does , however , have a lot of experience of [ what can happen if a country enforces mono-ethnicity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holocaust ) . 
  he believes what he 's saying ? 
  the man flip-flops on an instant 's notice whenever it 's politically opportune . 
  he is playing a political game that 's straight out of hitler 's playbook , he 's good at it , and you 're swallowing it hook , line and sinker along with all the fascist bmw-driving dumbfucks voting for him . 
  the pvv does * not * advocate `` freedom from religion '' , it only advocates `` freedom from islam '' . 
  it is quick to point out the judeo-christian traditions of this country whenver it riles against muslims . 
  they are only trying to close muslim schools , not any of the hundreds of christian schools in this country . 
  orthodox jews can `` dress up '' as much as they want , and they do . 
  of course it 's hardly surprising you 're not too fond of freedom * of * religion . 
  turkey has historically been more like a secular military dictatorship than like a real democracy . 
  you do n't seem to understand that freedom * from * religion and freedom * of * religion are one and the same thing ; that one can not exist without the other . 
  freedom can only exist if everyone is equal before the law . 
  the only way you can have your freedom is by being prepared to respect the freedom of others , including those you do n't like . 
  words do n't matter , actions do . 
  while you have been sitting there mesmerized by geert wilders ' amazing rhetorical skills ( `` kopvoddentaks '' was a real winner ) i have been observing the actions of this `` party '' and living with , and seeing my friends and family live with , the consequences of those actions . 
  at least you have the excuse you have n't seen those consequences from nearby . 
  sigh . 
  where do i start ? 
  name anything great about the netherlands and the pvv is probably calling it a `` leftwing hobby '' and trying to destroy it . 
  this would include anything to do with culture , society , social security , and acceptance of people such as yourself . 
  the pvv is not even a real party . 
  it has no voting members and geert wilders is its absolute dictator . 
  it is fundamentally antidemocratic . 
  but , we have a minority government that depends on support from the pvv fraction in parliament . 
  that means the pvv has disproportionate power over the government of this country even though they do not participate in it . 
  being turkish , you are probably a muslim . 
  the pvv hates muslims with an especially fierce passion ; they grew on a rabid anti-muslim platform . 
  they say islam is not a religion but a `` backward culture '' that is out to destroy our superior civilization . 
  they have proposed legislation to tax the wearing of headscarves in public , the `` headrag tax '' ( kopvoddentaks ) . 
  they have * actually succeeded * in banning face-covering garments . 
  freedom of religion is now officially dead here . 
  they are for a 100 % halt on all immigration from `` muslim countries '' including turkey . 
  if it were up to them , there would be no way for you to ever live in the netherlands . 
  which would of course mean you could n't vote for them . 
  at least that 's a plus . 
  lately , they have aimed their arrows at eastern europeans . 
  they have opened an `` eastern europeans hotline '' that paints eastern europeans as drunks and criminals and allows people to anonymously complain about them . 
  the minority government , being held hostage by the pvv , is refusing to condemn it . 
  the pvv claims to be for freedom of speech , but is the first to attempt to silence people who criticize them . 
  for example , in response to pvv plans to create isolated `` scumbag villages '' to forcibly house muslims , immigrants and other `` repeat scumbags '' , the left-wing broadcaster vara published a cartoon aptly likening this plan to ww2 concentration camps . 
  the pvv immediately demanded that it be taken down . 
  in the pvv world , only opinions that agree with the pvv are permitted .
