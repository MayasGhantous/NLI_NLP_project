  stuiver = 5 cent dubbeltje = 10 cent kwartje = quarter , 25 cents piek = 1 gulden rijksdaaler , heitje , knaak = 2,5 gulden geeltje = 25 gulden meier = 100 gulden rug , rooie ( red one ) = 1000 gulden i think there are more for some other denominations but i do n't know them . 
  i know we use tientje ( small 10 ) en vijfje ( small 5 ) for 10 and 5 guilders and now for euros . 
  no clue , i do n't live in my old town with the secondary education anymore . 
  i 'm not active on facebook . 
  so i really do n't know or care . 
  least favourite : the lack of electronics stores like a mediamarkt or saturn . 
  i 'm pretty much forced to buy anything electrical online or go to another big city . 
  favorite : the city is really green , plenty of trees and nature every where . 
  even there is a good beach at the river , which is a walkable distance form the city centre . 
  to be honest , in my opinion there are too many usa comparison questions over here . 
  there is a group of very active american askers , i like that they are keeping the sub is active . 
  but it seems every fucking question they ask is about something related to the usa . 
  it is getting old pretty quick . 
  i know i do n't ask questions myself . 
  and yes , i know i commented in this thread earlier , but i would have found this question much more interesting if it were about other european countries . 
  like the cultural differences within our country is interesting question , i could write about my own and learn about others . 
  this question , i skimped through the already given answers found added something that was n't there yet and this thread is pretty much done for me . 
  nothing new to learn , no interesting other insights . 
  i 'm really not attacking you or the other active americans on this sub , certainly not saying you should ask less question . 
  just giving my idea why this question is pretty low score . 
  i would like some 24/7 stores . 
  i would really like to do some shopping after i go home form sport practice or go on sunday in the morning and not have to wait until 12 to get some groceries . 
  would do a festival tour of europe . 
  kinda sucks that i ca n't do may , june and july , the best european festivals are then . 
  we hate finland . 
  finland is often above us in country ranking lists , like drinking the most coffee / happiest children . 
  those kind of list , so we always want to know if we have beaten finland . 
  other one is a meme about , the minister of justice ( or security ) once tweeted that he knew some one who died because of weed . 
  now we use it i know some one who died of x. 
  first year students are given a sweater form the university during their introduction week . 
  you rarely see someone where it though . 
  students show more pride towards certain clubs they joined , like study associations ( most studies have there own club , that gives discounts on books , organises lectures , and events . ), 
  student associations ( somewhat like fraternities ) or sport clubs . 
  most university cities have a lot of sport clubs just for students . 
  there is a students sports tournament in the netherlands . 
  it 's called gnsk , ( groot nederlands student kampioenschap ) , there about 18 sports during that tournament . 
  the student sport clubs represent the city/university they are from . 
  there is a overall ranking , to determine the ` best sports university ' . 
  and at least for handball ( not sure for other sports , i assume it 's the same though ) if you win , you are qualified for the european student sport tournament .

   likes to be nude at home with this kind of weather i ca n't blame him . 
  it 's way too hot to wear clothes . 
  oops , i meant just to link to the image . 
  at least you know where to buy it . 
  let 's not feed the troll . 
  we know better . 
  a good weizen will always go down when it is hot . 
  [ weihenstephaner ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/weihenstephaner-hefe-weissbier-germany-freising/dp/b00bavxxw0 ) is a personal favourite . 
  or make my own radler . 
  the shit that is hip now is just too sweet and not nice . 
  making your own with [ jever pils ] ( https://www.insidebeer.com/custom/jever.jpg ) is a great one , since it is a very bitter beer , adding some 7-up makes is a very good radler , but not as sweet normal radlers you buy and still tastes a bit like a beer . 
  americanised parties . 
  i really hate all the theme parties around halloween and st. patricks day . 
  i think those just should be celebrated where they originated . 
  not here , where we never had the tradition and now only use it as an excuse for a stupid theme party . 
  they are very rare in the netherlands , the last one was on 23-07-2014 when the first victims of the mh17 disaster came back . 
  according to a newspaper , and other sources , the last official one before that was on the funeral of princes wilhelmina in 1962 . 
  ( but wikipedia states that the funeral of kennedy in 1963 was a day of national mourning . ), 
  but for example the [ blijmer disaster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_al_flight_1862 ) remembrance was n't a day of national mourning . 
  futhermore the 4 of may ( day before our liberation day ) is remembrance day for al victims ( civilian or military ) who died during war , or peace operations since the second world war , in the kingdom of the netherlands or in any other place in the world . 
  the second one . 
  robocop , starship troopers , total recall ( original ) , basic instinct were a directed by a dutchman , paul verhoeven . 
  daario nahaaris is a dutch actor as well . 
  we have [ america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/america,_limburg ) not only once , but [ twice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amerika,_drenthe ) . 
  does stomae count ? 
  if not never , if yes , never . 
  my french is n't good , and since rap is mostly about the lyrics , i do n't really bother . 
  did n't like it , the drink was either to diluted from the ice or too cold to taste anything . 
  after a few days i just stuck to water in restaurants . 
  she is a model , but for the last elections she was the number one on the list for the pirate party here . 
  i guess thanks for the gold . 
  if i may recommend some other liquorice try oldtimers , their [ salmiak drop ] ( https://www.realdutchfood.com/voorraadkast/snoep/drop/oldtimers-salmiak-klinkers ) is pretty nice . 
  [ their scheepsknopen ] ( https://www.realdutchfood.com/oldtimers-scheepsknopen-zoet ) is probably my favourite liquorice . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.realdutchfood.com/venco-droptoefjes-zacht-zoet ) you can order them . 
  shipping to denmark is kinda expensive , though . 
  salmiak is used in dutch as well . 
  [ these ] ( https://www.dropwinkel.eu/image/data/harlekijntjes%20salmiak%20drop.png ) maybe ? 
  i recall correctly they are kinda what you described . 
  what kind of liquorice was it ? 
  do you remember the taste and maybe shape/form ? 
  plenty of people own one here . 
  because it is the only way to make good bitterballen . 
  i do n't own one since i live alone . 
  but at my student home where i lived for a while we had 2 fryers . 
  because 2 people wanted fries , and bought one when we did n't have one yet . 
  jill has been my right hand for a few years now . 
  we are inseparable . 
  bocholt in germany since it is the closest bigger city near me , and a very pleasant bike ride to that city . 
  for travelling alone op could check / r/solotravel as well . 
  i could n't remember it 's name . 
  but you are right , it is a big project as well . 
  handball . 
  it would be nice if it were much more on tv . 
  it is getting a bit more popular with the recent success of the dutch women 's team . 
  but then again it is a difficult sport to show on tv , since the cameras often miss a lot , and there is not much time for replays during a match . 
  the netherlands in completing the noord-zuid lijn ( north south line ) in amsterdam . 
  next big project is probably the new stadium in rotterdam . 
  i think the most popular team sport is field hockey after football . 
  tennis is the most popular sport after football , but that can be played alone as well . 
  edit : this would be in players registered with the union for that sport .
