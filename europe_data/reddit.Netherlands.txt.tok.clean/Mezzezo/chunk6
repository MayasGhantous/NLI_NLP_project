  how it is portrayed : dutch girl from friends ( to me she sound more russian then dutch . ), 
  the usa . 
  i might have triggered some people . 
  seriously i would consider chile or something in the andes , i would love to live a bit secluded an in the mountains . 
  in the netherlands there are plenty of weekly flea markets . 
  they are sometimes hard to find information about . 
  but we have a national holiday sort of dedicated to flee markets , on [ koningsdag ( kingsday ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koningsdag ) there are flea markets everywhere . 
  there is a [ german version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oasegz3xe_e ) . 
  ( might not be that safe for work ) [ drank & drugs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swivbesd50 ) this is not my type of music , i rarely listen to pop music . 
  only wanted to share something that was a popular in the netherlands . 
  we have them in the achterhoek as well , as far as i know the bonfire is a eastern/northern tradition in the netherlands . 
  my city was founded during the roman empire , then it was called noviomagus . 
  we want to claim were are the oldest city in the netherlands , but other cities want to claim that as well . 
  it is only in dutch , but the [ pricewatch ] ( https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/ ) might work with google translate . 
  i think the electronic comparison website www.tweakers.net has much better filters then it 's american counterparts ( especially pcpartpicker ) . 
  it 's is much easier to find something you are liking for on tweakers then pcpartpicker . 
  but it only has dutch website , so it would n't work very well for americans . 
  stukjes is the only real pindakaas . 
  this is a thread about american products , so i kinda assumed you were talking about american peanut butter . 
  my bad . 
  i think it is starting to become more popular . 
  i know a few people who brew their own beers , not spirits . 
  though back in my secondary education ( high school ) we did brew our own beer and wine during chemistry classes as well . 
  but dutch peanut butter is so much better . 
  ( i might have some prejudice though ), 
  that is actually a very good point . 
  i assumed a bit since most country subs are n't that big/active that their wiki might not be very relevant or up to date . 
  but that is probably wrong of me to assume . 
  ( alright not our country sub ) but there was a match thread with a dutch football club ( i think ) over on / r/soccer that just was dutch making jokes about belgians , and belgians making jokes about the dutch, 
  could you explain the situation a bit more ? 
  what is currently going on in romania ? 
  what is the situation you want to discuss ? 
  i 'm in favor of building a tourist question wiki here . 
  there have been plenty travel question about cheapest travel across eu , or that buying a car and doing a roadtrip idea . 
  those answers are n't going to change a lot every time they get asked . 
  i get they are n't annoying yet , but i think might be nice to ahead of this . 
  and just start collecting threads , and putting them together . 
  maybe look into a interrail ticket . 
  for younger people it is a cheap and easy way to travel around europe . 
  ( and look on the subs of the cities , at least / r/amsterdam has a very good wiki with a lot of information ), 
  100/100 for $ 10 . 
  buti live in a student housing complex , so i do n't have a choice and have to pay for tv as well . 
  so i pay $ 15 a month . 
  pinkpop , zwarte cross , a camping flight to a lowlands paradise , down the rabbit hole , best kept secret , into the grave , dynamo metalfestival , roadburn , woo-haa , we are electric . 
  but there are many more . 
  i do n't care hoe much i make and what i have to do , as long as i pay all the standard things like rent , insurance and my phone . 
  then pay for food , and maybe have some left to save/spent on fun things . 
  that all i care for . 
  in the netherlands there is a kbab dish that is called the ` kapsalon ' ( the hairdresser ) . 
  it might be the greatest kabab dish ever . 
  it is fries , covered with kebab meat , covered with salad , covered with cheese . 
  and then it is melted a bit . 
  i live in the east as well , never called americans ami 's . 
  only the people form the other side of the border did that . 
  oh , that is true , but that was the main topic when i looked on the nos app . 
  now it is probably krol who is cutting down on his campaign . 
  what is kefir ? 
  today mostly things about the elections , like wilders who is n't doing another interview thing because he does n't think it is fun . 
  in sport news : the own goal from the psv goalkeeper is a hot topic since it is one of the first goal spotted ( and could only have been spotted ) by the hawk eye system . 
  where do you store clothes ? 
  i have the same , except the armchair is a couches . 
  and i have a bookcase and a closet for clothes . 
  lucky you . 
  i only see a few very expensive vip packages left . 
  do you already have tickets for tomorrowland ? 
  both weekend are sold out already . 
  yes !, 
  we were building one as well , if i recall correctly , next to flevoland . 
  i do n't want to tell directly which city it is . 
  i 'll let you guess . 
  in my town we get once a year a massive amount of tourist form the entire world . 
  mostly military though . 
  they are here for a four day event , which is the biggest of its kind in the world . 
  the week around these 4 days there are big parties in the cities . 
  this is in the netherlands . 
  few months ago i had a big outage for internet and tv . 
  before that , the last time was maybe 3/4 years ago . 
  just got an email , that in march they are finishing the redundant network for us and we get a coupon for the cinema ( as compensation ) . 
  hopefully with the redundant network in place outages will be more rare . 
  this year i started to see some pubs even organise some st. patrick 's day events . 
  once in washington dc , so we just kept going from one museum to the other . 
  they were all really nice and cool , but made the ` hit ' you got from stepping outside was a bit annoying . 
  biggest by numbers is the [ zwarte cross ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwarte_cross#edities_in_cijfers ) . 
  cool festival with motorcross , silly parades , theatre , music and a lot of children stuff . 
  [ pinkpop ] ( http://www.pinkpop.nl/history/pinkpop-by-numbers/ ) is big as well . 
  longest running music festival in the world . 
  they are very mainstream , and very popular . 
  camping outside the shop for tickets . 
  this are the biggest performances held every year . 
  [ lowlands ] ( http://lowlands.nl/ ) ( full name : a camping flight to a lowlands paradise ) is even about [ ( 50.000 visitors ) ] ( http://www.omroepflevoland.nl/nieuws/138716/biddinghuizen-meer-dan-50-000-bezoekers-voor-lowlands ) but they do n't sell day tickets , so everybody is there for the full festival . 
  it 's a bit more alternative then pinkpop , but still quite a main stream festival . 
  not a mainstream music genre , but still very big over here . 
  they have really cool closing shows . 
  most popular by unique visitors amount is the [ zwarte cross ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwarte_cross#edities_in_cijfers ) . 
  pinkpop has about [ half ] ( http://www.pinkpop.nl/history/pinkpop-by-numbers/ ) the unique visitors . 
  and lowlands is even about half [ ( 50.000 visitors ) ] ( http://www.omroepflevoland.nl/nieuws/138716/biddinghuizen-meer-dan-50-000-bezoekers-voor-lowlands ) that since they do n't sell day tickets . 
  ( about 60.000 ), 
  well that is an [ expensive laptop ] ( https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/641825/hp-probook-450-g4-y8b39et.html ) over here , with a $ 695 price . 
  for the price you mentioned it is kinda nice , but not for the dutch price . 
  still busy , but not with tourist , would be utrecht .
