the `` country '' the terrorists are trying to hold on to, 
  i 'm going to get downvoted to hell , but i see what you are trying to say . 
  these guys are trying to defend their country and are upset they made the wrong judgment . 
  the swearing makes clear they were n't aiming for a large passenger plane , but probably an ukrainian military/cargo plane . 
  yes they made the decision to down a plane , but this is not the damage they were hoping for . 
  ukraine , georgia and moldavia all have area 's that currently do not fit into the union . 
  we need stability in the union right now . 
  baguette, 
  i do n't think so , especially as the netherlands voted ( in a referendum ) against the european constitution in 2005 . 
  add to that that our country will lead the eu at the start of the next year , our reasons will be known to the people . 
  this is n't about helping ukraine economically , this is about our government not listening to our wishes not to expend the eu any further . 
  it is n't so much anti-eu , it 's against more extension of the eu to the east . 
  and , anti-eu = pro-russian ? 
  no , they did not . 
  they talked a lot about ukraine , moldavia and georgia and why we need our government to listen more to the people of the netherlands instead of the eu, 
  yes !, 
  we did it !, 
  ** the netherlands ** 443.000 people signed a petition for a referendum about the european agreement with ukraine , moldavia and georgia http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2015/09/yes_we_could.html, 
  fuck you man , especially feeders look hot, 
  / r/brutalism, 
  vatican city . 
  well , more ships for us !, 
  just like in iraq , right ? 
  i know , but most people would freak out, 
  what about flevoland ? 
  great to see a country using it 's natural resources to invest in good things, 
  limburg : real carnaval and good beer brabant : fake carnaval , bad beer and new kids, 
  i 'd rather reunite both limburgs, 
  dirty bombs have a `` fear factor '' working for them . 
  try telling your population that the nuclear material scattered in their neighborhood is depleted and not-that-dangerous . 
  but not in limburg , only in brabant . 
  one war with a peace in-between, 
  en new kids . 
  one of us . 
  it was different years back , but the recent generation of adolescents have some anti-gay people in them, 
   holland the netherlands . 
  got a letter when i was seventeen that there is a `` dienstplicht '' , that 's it . 
  i really hate it when people call the netherlands holland ... 
  oh god no , it 's the lemon stealing whore !, 
  and current sealand is n't on it !, 
  * the netherlands, 
  * the netherlands, 
  so you 're just calling people racist , but you do n't know anything about them ? 
  it 's not legal in amsterdam, 
  what are you doing ? 
  are you going to take zeeuws vlaanderen from us ? 
  just do some research about drugs laws when travelling , that 'll save you some trouble . 
  o really ? 
  a law is a law . 
  if you do n't agree with it , fight it . 
  but do n't call policemen enforcing it racists , they just follow the rules set by the government . 
  why do you include the `` he 's a black man '' in it ? 
  if someone who has claimed to smoke numerous joints a day , sings and talks about being high all the time all the time is being caught by the police being high ( where it is illegal to be high ) pulling the race card is total nonsense ... 
  let 's play a game of spot the american !, 
  saved for when i 'll have good internet again , thanks !, 
  the eastern part of wallonia near germany ? 
  how come the netherlands were opposed to it ? 
  sometimes it ** is ** good for the forest and the diversity , but it takes a lot of time, 
  let the market economy handle it !, 
  so , what 's the unemployment in the german speaking part ? 
  i do n't . 
  so , you 're accusing me of things because other people do it ? 
  that 'd be hypocritical . . 
  i do n't like being called the wrong name , why 'd i call someone else by the wrong name ? 
  there is n't a `` split '' between the hollanders and other provinces , we 're all citizens of the netherlands . 
  there are friezen , groningers , etc. 
  hollanders are from the region of holland , just like limburgers are from limburgs and utrechtenaren are from utrecht . 
  haha i know , i was just joking . 
  terrible name tho, 
  and walibi netherlands !, 
  tv limburg ( collaboration with the flemish limburg ) or l1 , 
  the province i 'm from was n't part of `` holland '' , large parts of the country were n't . 
  so why should we call it holland all of a sudden ? 
  it 's just a wrong name , it does n't matter how many people use it . 
  * the region, 
  haha , we 're the crazy ones, 
  indoctrination by the hollandic media, 
  no , it actually is n't a good analogy . 
  the usa are the biggest economy in both america 's , so why would n't we call the whole continent usa ? 
  i think people from the states would n't mind it , and there are a lot of people living there . 
  so , hypothetically , the name would stick . 
  would mexican people like that ? 
  brazilian people ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  you can have all the sites of the world calling it holland , all the hollanders calling it holland . 
  but holland stays holland and the netherlands stay the netherlands . 
  maybe if they had ruhrgebiet-centric people like you are hollandcentric , they would be called by the wrong name too !, 
  no , a ** region ** of the netherlands is called holland . 
  the belgians traded us to the netherlands for belgian luxembourg, 
  holland is the name for a region in the netherlands . 
  it 's a wrong name . 
  the united states are located in america , the netherlands are n't located ** in ** holland . 
  while you 're at it , call germany ruhrgebiet !, 
  because we are n't french !, 
  it is wrong , i will correct people, 
  aggggreed !, 
  indeed , too bad . 
  would be a hard job to do i guess . 
  it may differ from place to place i guess , we call them `` duutsjers '', 
  listen mate , that a lot of people call it that way does n't make it correct .
