  why not have separate threads in different languages ? 
  i find it bad that you have to say that you are not pegida , not ukip . 
  even if i do n't agree with them , it 's stupid not to listen to people and have a conversation about the things they have to say . 
  being open and honest about opinions , is n't that what europe should be about ? 
  haha , i think we 'll meet again some time . 
  but people in the usa actually live in america so they would n't be offended if somebody calls if america . 
  i for instance do n't live in holland , i live in zeeland and i am from limburg . 
  both provinces of the netherlands . 
  holland is at least a hour and a half away from me , so i am offended if somebody calls me a `` hollander '' . 
  i live closer to belgium than hollan . 
  look mate , we had a discussion about this subject some time ago . 
  it does n't matter how many times you say it , how many people say it . 
  holland is not the name of the netherlands and people who think it does are just uninformed or willfully ignorant . 
  people from brazil would also be offended if you 'd call the american continent usa . 
  even if people from the usa or europe would call the whole continent usa , it 'd still be wrong . 
  calling the netherlands holland is falsifying history and culture . 
  many regions in the netherlands have more in common historically with the belgian or the german people than the provinces of holland . 
  i wish it would n't be that way , i wish i had some nice stories about roma people . 
  but i do n't , every story i know is about stealing and other criminal activities, 
  holland is the name for two provinces . 
  it is simply ignorant to call all of the twelve `` holland '' . 
  i was n't really serious about it , but i really dislike the hollandcentrism of our government and the media . 
  and that 's why i 'd like to see a unified limburg . 
  please do , belgium is much better, 
  potato today, 
  i buy my mother flowers and if i come home in the weekends she 'll make me dinner . 
  sadly , i do n't . 
  my mother ( police officer ) told to many stories about roma people, 
  that 'd be great , free guns !, 
  i 'd get the government to make a contract with me so i 'd sell them the free guns . 
  sounds like a fun idea for a soap, 
  how about denmark ? 
  they would n't even have a clue what happened and why it happened, 
  * police clashes * migrants * strike * chaos ** dingdingding , confirmed french **, 
  or speakers with really annoying music, 
  in a european sub , is it necessary to say that people are in fact european ? 
  i was caught , in the middle of a railroad track !, 
  when i was 15 i went to lisbon for a school trip . 
  every time the potsellers would walk up to us and started doing their business . 
  they walked away when we said we are dutch, 
  i think the same about all religions , if you do n't harass me or infuse religious talk in law/politics i 'm fine with it . 
  please please please do another spacerace !, 
  seeing that really makes me want to visit russia , the architecture ( not only the red square , i really like industrial and brutalist buildings ) , the history . 
  if only i had the time and money, 
  i miss the lighthouse on our banknotes , that 's all, 
  i 'm sorry , i thought it was a norwegian only thing ... do they have the \u00c6\u00d8\u0100 ? 
  oh , i wish you all the best !, 
  no problem mate !, 
  what are your plans in amsterdam , work or studying i suppose ? 
  i do n't know if you 're already subbed , but if you have n't you should sub to / r/thenetherlands, 
  sounds about right , only it is het nederlands if you mean the language . 
  if you mean the country by itself it is nederland ( without die ) . 
  where are you moving to ? 
  building dikes *, 
  bj\u00f6rn , am i legally allowed to smack you ? 
  - n.n.n. . no daddy , what have i done wrong ? nothing , just a reddit question . 
  like kicking dogs is in spain ? 
  and what if the danger comes from across the channel ? 
  you need backup strats !, 
  [ your country ] has a [ the citizens of my country ] minority who are suppressed !, 
  we must liberate them , by doing military exercises near the border . 
  the greater part of the randstad is indeed in holland , and the media and historic education is very hollandcentric . 
  the country is indeed called by the two names by ignorant people . 
  it does n't matter how many people say 3 +3 = 8 , it 's just wrong . 
  and for the `` limburg '' part , i wo n't call other provinces by their wrong name . 
  but the united states of america ** are ** in america . 
  the greatest part of what you call * holland * ** is not ** located in holland . 
  the ** country ** is n't called holland . 
  it 's called the netherlands . 
  also , your argument about usa makes no sense at all . 
  it would be like calling the usa texas or california . 
  people wo n't like it when you 'd do that because it 's just not right . 
  i do n't live in the provinces called holland , and people who identify as `` hollanders '' who are n't living in holland are just plain wrong . 
  i love closer to belgium and germany and historically we have more ties with them than to holland . 
  so should i falsify my provinces history by calling it holland ? 
  no and i 'm happy that many people in rural provinces also do n't . 
  it 's not that i really hate hollanders , it 's just that i hate how holland and the netherland are used as equal terms , the media is holland-centric just like history lessons in schools and how groningen and limburg are/have been used . 
  oh and please do something about the walloons , you can smell luik from maastricht !, 
  we were on your side !, 
  and you traded us !, 
  i like the netherlands , i dislike holland . 
  you traded us to the dutch for ( now belgian ) luxemburg . 
  they hate hollanders , dutch people hate holland too for a large part, 
  no no , you all say you hate holland . 
  the rest seems alright to most of my belgian classmates, 
  have the same thing with france hehe, 
  limburg sterk !, 
  sadly , no corrupt people trying to get that bid ... 
  confirmed french . 
  anti-radical islamist circlejerk seems alright with me . 
  anti-radical anything circlejerk seems alright to me . 
  you 're a boss, 
  which part of `` honhonhon '' do n't you understand ? 
  not 88 ? 
  again . 
  confirmed french . 
  confirmed french . 
  i chuckled hehe, 
  but , if i drink i get diarrhea . 
  will the oil cancel that out ?
