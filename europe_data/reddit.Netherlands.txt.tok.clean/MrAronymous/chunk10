  prejudice or valid assumption ? 
   when the weather is awful which it nearly always is . 
  welp . 
  there goes your credibility in this post . 
  anyone against ( controled , regulated , conform rules , blabla ) mass-migration into europe is racist . 
  got it . 
  well no fucking shit . 
  is that what he needs a whole segment for ? 
  could 've done the same by reading 3 news headlines . 
  obviously there 's more to it than just showing that the system is failing . 
  blame the dutch architects and city planners and the suburban zeitgeist in general . 
  that 's actually a reason why a lot of people do n't like rotterdam . 
  the streets may be spacious , but that also attracts a lot of car traffic and noise . 
  all the open space also make the place look somewhat desolate compared to older streets with higher density surrounding them . 
  liar .

  i think it 's that we generally see ourselves as having our shit together and most other countries not having their shit together , and we 're not willing to give that up . 
  we very much value our souvereignty . 
  and because of that , federalism support is low , and it 's the reason we voted against ~ ~ lisbon treaty ~ ~ european constitution as well . 
  i can see a union army working , but not as * one * individual army . 
  that 'd be a shitshow .

  children shows/voice-overs . 
  people downvoting him : it 's true . 
  the voices sound . . `` flat '' . 
  also the actors are n't even trying to translate the exact emotions or intonation . 
  just go to any netflix show that has german dubbing and see for yourself . 
  you read the subtitles faster than what 's being said , so i can easily point out translation errors . 
  chicken policy led to poverty . 
  or wait was it the egg . 
  huh ? 
  i meant countries like australia , nz , canada , etc. 
  so culturally ` european ' / western/whatever as opposed to african or middle-eastern and the like . 
  western as in white and european-influenced . 
  shit 's expensive yo .

  market price . 
  does the american dream mean nothing to you . 
  the parking spaces in manhattan have some of the fairest prices in the us . 
  nowhere else would you find a parking space that actually costs what it should . 
  we 're talking about storing a large metal box , often in the public space . 
  and yet the expensive roads and bridges are still massively subsidised . 
  but you never hear about that from transit or bike lane haters . 
   competing for street space in the largest city in the us , where there is n't enough room to swing your own dick . 
  this is so true . 
  cars traffic should largely be banned , or actually pay their fair share . 
  we have plenty of on-street bike lanes . 
  usually they 're there because full seperation was not possible/overall the best solution . 
  they work because most people are aware of their surroundings . 
  dooring accidents do happen though . 
  hey hey hey . 
  we were first . 
  no flags here . 
  we had to learn capital cities around the world , countries , rivers , mountain regions , seas . 
  [ those are the old ones though .

  well before ideal you could n't . 
  you could do a wire transfer , but it was quite a hassel and not instantly clear who you 're actually paying ( just a number ) . 
  so yes , you could buy stuff online , but not directly via the webstore itself . 
  it was a hassle and now it is n't . 
  completely opposite in the netherlands . 
  we were very swift to adopted iban , chip & pin , contactless ( almost anywhere now ) , stores actively encourage using debit cards even for low amounts . 
  some places are even going card-only ( buses ) . 
  credit cards are unpopular though ( because they 're basically a debit card with fees and a loan attached ) . 
  ideal is a service that makes it possible to pay directly to a webstore via your bank account . 
  something every sane country should have . 
  an online equivalent of a debit card . 
  it 's not a completely different payment system . 
  i agree it 's too much for a cup of herb flavoured boiled water , but 80 % chance you were in a hipster establishment in central amsterdam . 
  those prices come with the store concept . 
  i do n't get the point with these sort of things . 
  what are they trying to accomplish ? 
  media attention from poland or are they also protesting abortion stuff in romania ? 
  that actually aired on public television . 
  i am so confused . 
  yes , but that does n't make sense when you can have it as a dutch word instead . 
  re + cyclus + en, 
  technically , no . 
  de-facto , yes . 
  but . . it should be . 
  does n't require that much more effort + you get a nice proper dutch sentence . 
  we should adopt recycleren too . 
  no , because `` an '' sounds like `` een '' in english , but not in dutch , where it sounds more like `` aan '' . 
  there needs to be a clear distinction between the two languages ( left vs. right ) for it to be useful .
