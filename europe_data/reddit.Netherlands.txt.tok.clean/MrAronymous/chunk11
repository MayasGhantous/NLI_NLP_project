  i only have one wall-mounted thermostat for the system and these knobs at every radiator so you can set them individually . 
  these threads are fine , but only when they mark the important anniversaries like 10 , 25 , 50 or 100 years . 
  otherwise you could have multiple memorial threads every day . 
  they . . [ covered the wreck ] ( https://youtu.be/nidpdrozo_0?t=23m50s ) with gravel ? 
  why ? 
  have you actually been near one ? 
  they make plenty of noise . 
  i do n't think a lot of people oppose the windmills when they 're located a bit away from historical areas or homes . 
  like the harbours for example , should be full of them , and they look kind of nice along the dikes . 
  but since we 're pretty densely populated ( though not a mess like belgium ) , we value our open space . 
  so all the open space we have like nature reserves , the ` green heart ' and dunes are a no-go . 
  and the rest needs to be looked at very carefully , because we have created a pretty darn nice living environments and we 're not willing to give that up in the name of green energy . 
  have you actually been close to one ? 
  they do cause noise , it 's a valid concern . 
  i support closer ties with iran ( and them getting rid of their religious government system ) but this seems just random and weird . 
  well , wind mills cause noise . 
  we 're a small and very densely populated country so there is n't a whole lot of space . 
  also it 's flat , so you can see those things from miles and miles away . 
  there 's talks of constructing more of them in the sea .

   if citizens of calais start to sell inflatable botas to people in the jungle why has n't this happened yet . 
  of course it 's [ connected ] ( http://www.zja.nl/image/2014/10/15/2099_1200_800.jpg%28mediaclass-default.f996b08cf5abfa43b3b03133a89ec231272756a9%29.jpg ) . 
  you can see it when it zooms out at the end . 
  it takes 10-15 minutes taxiing . 
  some people jokingly call it [ haarlem ] ( https://www.leveninnieuwvennep.nl/images/linv/fotomateriaal/2014_linv_gemeente%20haarlemmermeer2.jpg ) international airport .

  meanwhile . . [ dutch article ] ( http://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/turks-nederlandse-journalist-fatih-ozyar-opgepakt-in-poelenburg~a4376149 ) ( you 'll have to use translate in your browser ) he whipped out his phone and started filming with a group of youths while there was a temporary local ban on assembly put in place because of youths who were being a nuisance while vlogging .

  you can see it clearly when driving across the border . 
  1960s housing everywhere in flanders . 
  here we comparatively only have few of them , most of which are 4 storey apartment blocks which are now getting demolished and replaced with something more diverse in housing sizes and shapes ( which should result in a more diverse population , i.e. 
  preventing ghetto-forming ) . 
  i know , i was hesitant to use that as an example but ca n't think of a better one . 
  you 're just going to have to take my word for it . 
  dutch fashion can be more ` daring ' . 
  if that yield better results is debatable but the british dress more sober and classic . 
  you can see this difference in modern architecture too you know . 
  british style is more classy/classic , therefore conservative . 
  everything you 'd find in a marks & spencers would only be bought by 65 + here . 
  lol . 
  no but 30 + people definitely do . 
  the style of clothing is definitely more conservative . 
  the myth is about ` bad teeth ' . 
  while it 's proven your teeth are quite healthy , the look of your teeth can be quite bad . 
  i notice it all the time on tv shows ( average people , not only chavs ) . 
  well you actually tend to dress more conservatively .

  full body covering clothing for religious reasons . 
  and yet many were disappointed at the outcome here .

   he wants to deny people with opposing viewpoints a platform source ? 
  i explained my reasoning right after . 
  it 's different from the burkini ban , because there there 's no strongholding argument to be made . 
  oh i get it now . 
  fatties are just a result of * joie de vivre * and therefore part of french culture . 
  and here i was thinking that they just chose to eat too much . 
  yeah . 
  better put on some clothing . 
  do n't go in the water though , you might get fined . 
  have you banned fat yet . 
  hate seeing fat people at the beach . 
  tell me , how naked must i be to adhere to french social norms ?
