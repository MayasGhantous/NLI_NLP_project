  is [ this ] ( http://g03.a.alicdn.com/kf/htb1psfumpxxxxxnxxxxq6xxfxxxv/cheap-styles-plus-size-swimwear-women-2016-blue-green-xxl-5xl-one-piece-swimsuit-large-size.jpg ) not showing enough skin ? 
  thank god i have [ a spare pair ] ( https://historymaniacmegan.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/07-05-bikini2-570x400.jpg ) for if i ever happen to be in france . 
  these bans are so ridiculous and i honestly ca n't understand why there 's people defending them . 
  did they suddenly forget about the * libert\u00e9 * part ? 
  the only reason for this ban is `` i do n't like muslims '' , there 's no logical other explanation . 
  the la\u00efcit\u00e9 i totally get , but how is this part of that ? 
  the burqa ban i also get . 
  not showing your face is considered incredibly rude according to western culture and in the western psyche , and is considered by many as scary . 
  it 's also a possible security danger . 
  but seriously , how is a woman with a body covered with swimming clothing ( participating in society , mind you ) rude , scary or possibly bannable ? 
  i mean i do n't like displays of religion either , i do n't like religion at all , but this is not the way you 're going to get muslim women participating in society or going to get rid of islam if that 's the goal . 
  it sure is . 
  the first ones are actually already on their way . 
  [ pic1 ] ( https://www.amsterdam.nl/publish/pages/595049/visual_boerenwetering_15okt2015_4.jpg ) [ pic2 ] ( http://www.ataindex.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/snede-entreehuisjes-988x768.jpg ) we have so many bodies of water and canals that we could easily get rid of half of the city 's surface parking . 
  of course that would would not always be an ideal solution , but for the historic canal belt it 's very much worth considering . 
  there would finally be space for pedestrians to walk , imagine that . 
  i 'm also very much a proponent of a metro line going under prinsengracht . 
  uh dude , underneath the canals . 
  it just feels different from other dutch cities because of the difference in public space . 
  it 's supposedly the best zoo in the country . 
  it 's ... different . 
  you have to understand the basic history first : city center was completely bombed to the ground in wwii . 
  it used to look a lot like other dutch cities with canals , charming ports , etc. 
  that of course brought some good sides , as the city now has a modern center with highrises . 
  the city lacked a bit of identity the last half century , but they definitely are on their way to fix that with many new buildings and cool developments . 
  the downside is that the city center is n't really as vibrant as it could have been , as many things were originally planned with cars in mind and built in the 70s ( that should be a big hint ) . 
  then again , i 've learned that the `` horrible car centric city '' we dutch like to sometimes complain about is standard elsewhere outside of the netherlands , lol . 
  just take it as it is , and definitely go explore as many areas as you can . 
  must-sees : central station , coolsingel , oudehaven , blaak/markhal , wilhelminapier/erasmusbrug , witte de withstraat , kralingse plas , zoo . 
  you do n't have to . 
  i had a great time there . 
  the hotel , although very old , was really nice as well . 
  it was a bit warm , but not too bad . 
  we barely spent any time around san marco , that helps a lot with the crowds . 
  is n't that part of the charm though ? 
  and it 's not like the whole city is crumbling . 
  and you dislike a whole city because one touristy square has birds on it ? 
  wow . 
  the only thing i could fault venice for is the tourist crowds and lack of streetlife with locals , but i did n't find it that bothersome . 
  i did n't even smell anything either . 
  in an east/west divide , austria was western . 
  very true . 
  den haag is atypical because of its history , so is rotterdam . 
  maastricht because of its location and amsterdam because of its status . 
  the rest i would call fairly typical . 
  why ? 
  madrid 's pretty nice . 
  you 're talking about the old buildings and monuments . 
  you 're forgetting about [ the rest ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1mxeuvi5_cy/tp_yookibii/aaaaaaaabno/dxx3xihjob0/s1600/turkey+2011+1607.jpg ) . 
  does n't negate the fact that it 's very aesthetically pleasing . 
  so sad really , beacause the building itself is really beautiful . 
  could n't they have put a really beautiful anti-communist symbol on the top instead ? 
  to be fair , i would put switzerland together with austria and southern germany , northern italy , and maybe even throw a part of alpine france and some czech and slovenian regions in there . 
  i mean you are definitely similar to us , but just not as similar as northen germany and denmark . 
  would you agree ? 
  i 'd say flanders is right in between . 
  wallonia and luxembourg are understandibly way closer to france . 
  well i 'm not basing it off that per se , but of course language is a big part of culture , and that these germanic languages are part of the same family sure helps . 
  but when i look at this area i see similar architecture , egalitarianism , down-to-earthness , pragmatism , even the landscape is very much alike . 
  who care about nobility though ? 
  it 's all about contemporary attitudes to daily life . 
  uh , yeah , no . 
  culturally we are way closer to germans and danish . 
  the french and english are way different . 
   or anyone affiliated with the netherlands really queen . 
  you seem bitter somehow . 
  2016 keeps on giving, 
  are n't caribbean-blacks one of the most integrated , well-adjusted , least-hated immigrant groups in the uk ? 
  and you have erdogan . 
  ergo , not reliable . 
  i dare call him a fascist though . 
  but you could be the [ double dick ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1u75hh/i_am_the_guy_with_two_penises_ama ) ( nsfw ) !, 
  motherlode \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7, 
  aparantly we have * two * standard maximum speed limits for restricted-access highways . 
  uhh ? 
  but you 'll look like a conservative muslim who is n't integrated very well . 
  i consider those more of a problem than refugees to be honest . 
  look well kept , have manners , do n't have a long beard ( unless wearing hipster clothing ) , do n't wear a mandress . 
  that 's not bad at all . 
  even all the colours are of the same colour family . 
  if you want to see some ugly contrasting shit , go to [ belgium ] ( https://www.instagram.com/uglybelgianhouses/ ) . 
  but an apartment can be maisonette . 
  trees like dictators more then , got it . 
  sure , in german . 
  not in english though . 
  yep . 
  [ saw it live on tv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvhy4pcirgk ) . 
  a police officer talked very briefly with the guy , so he was n't dead instantly . 
  how very secular . 
  so germany gained 0.00000014 % meanwhile empire of the netherlands [ gained ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/30/belgium-and-the-netherlands-exchange-land-because-it-makes-sense ) 0.0002407 % #soon, 
   they already threatened the us with war i wish them good luck . 
  it 's a talent . 
  theoretically turkey 's government is secular . 
  the people and culture is still majorly muslim though . 
   why should it be different in the netherlands because it 's in a different country . 
   expat communities can we call them what they are please ? 
  an expat is somebody who is a temporary immigrant , usually because of work-related reasons . 
  an immigrant goes to live somewhere else , usually for a longer period of time .
