  because wars happened means that eu countries should cease to exist . 
  you seem to be forgetting that the eu is a collection of * nations * . 
  and those nations have cultures with their own set of ideals , values and lanuguages . 
  if ending up like the usa is the goal , that sounds like a nightmare to me . 
  anyone here who says no must have no reason for it . 
  right . 
  but if that 's reason enough for you to leave you , then do . 
  good luck applying for that green card though . 
  they 're mocking the tumblr feminists . 
  one could also say that the freedom of `` choosing '' your own religion and living according to your own culture is part of the individual liberty that liberalism and therefore europe ( at least in the 1600s netherlands ) is famous for . 
   black troops generally behaved more courteously and with more dignity than the brash white gis , who openly mocked britain 's old fashioned cars , bad food and even its poor plumbing -- so much so that many britons preferred them to their countrymen , who soon earned the sobriquet of `` overpaid , overfed , oversexed and over here '' . 
  lol, 
  i do n't think he 's saying that other countries should `` topple the putin regime '' , but rather that most of the problems russians face in their daily life can be traced back to corruption and failed democracy . 
  if that could be resolved ( preferably from within of course ) , it would make russia prosper economically and socially , and make their citizens happier ( is n't that the end-goal in life ? ) . 
  when russians are happier with how things go they are less likely to play a blame-game and resort to nationalism and the foreign invasions ( threats ) that come with it . 
  at least , that 's the theory . 
  so if poland sees two of russia 's neighbours being invaded/attacked it ca n't take precautions ? 
  they should just ignore it ? 
  i would say dads wearing ` casual ' shoes to appear hip . 
  boat shoes , vans or . . [ asics ] ( https://cdn.kleding.nl/l299509834/heren-sneakers-asics-aaron-sneakers-laag-white-legion-blue.jpg ) . 
  plus a kniebroek . 
  they do n't though , because they will use their local dialect most of the time . 
  if i 'm unprepared it can easily take a couple of seconds before you figure out it 's some variety of dutch . 
  do n't join the alliance because you are afraid of attacks , because we will attack you if you do !, 
  super rich ? 
  not poor ? 
  yes . 
  haha . 
  i only ever saw these in my school . 
  and one time we had kids changing the window from tilting to opening sideways , but it was n't done correctly , so the window came out and only hung from the lower hinge . 
  you could still close it and lock it , but the upper part was still unhinged . 
  but do you honestly think there 's not a lot of russian political votes ? 
  cause there are . 
  every year . 
  the song itself was so mediocre . 
  if it were greece singing it without the screen it would have ended somewhere down the middle . 
  so only countries with large diasporas should win then ? 
  germany has weird taste in music . 
  the russian embassy complaining about how the contest was rigged or something . 
  at least the singing itself was flawless . 
  he particicpated in `` best singer/songwriter '' . 
  bulgaria definitely was . 
  france , spain and even austria were too . 
  fuck this guy for having an opinion right . 
  let 's all dowvote him !, 
  you have n't seen [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee_iupineuc ) yet ? 
   the point of the eu improving and easing economic development . 
  and changing laws that hinder or could improve that development . 
  at least that was the case before the european federationists started appearing everywhere . 
  which you still have to pay for . 
  a digital application . . not that it 's outrageously expensive , but it 's quite unfriendy just on principle alone . 
  just call it an e-visa , because that 's basically what it is . 
  you could n't be more condescending if you tried . 
  production will only halt in 2018 though . 
  which seems like a stupidly long time for a simple ` stop the presses ' rule to be implemented . 
  for those who do n't know ; dutch * oe * = english * oo * , german * u * , french * ou * most sounds are ` standard european ' , however ; * blub * [ bl\u00f6b ] & * kukelekuu * [ k\u00fckelek\u00fc ], 
  what the . . 
  our country is actually overly present when it comes to kiddie porn servers . 
  no joke . 
  lo and behold i actually go downvoted :') / r/europe is so stupid at times yes , i 'm sure . 
  i lived in france for a while , on a hill not even a fifth as high as those on the picture . 
  yet the struggle was real . 
  got some real good calf workouts before deciding the 10 minute wait for the bus was worth it . 
  he wanted to kill people , and so he did . 
  such non-news . 
  yet i would n't want to live there . 
  those hills must be tiring af . 
  as i read online ( paraphrasing ) : they want to stop getting taken advantage of by the west ( = eu ) and make turkey great again ^ \u00ae . 
  they want turkey to get more power and influence in the region . 
  ah that makes more sense . 
  i liked it better when it was new holland . 
  now i understand it might not be worth the price but i wonder , can it really be that bad ? 
  why do we have so many ( proportionally ) ? 
  is it because there are a lot of data centers here ? 
  i guess it 's an `` enemy of my enemy is my friend '' type of situation . 
  think of all the pollution and space you will save as well !, 
  that 's how we got our plural name as well . 
  when belgium left they named themselves after a latin name for the region and we kept the name , but made singular . 
  nowadays , ` the netherlands ' in dutch includes belgium and possibly luxembourg . 
  other countries/languages did n't feel like keeping up with our changed name . 
   hungary does n't seem want to be saved from corruption , so let 's remove them . 
  remove paprika . 
   they important to clarify . 
  * most * of the hate towards the west is due to wars and political interventions . 
  the hate from religious extremists ( which is n't a small group unfortunately ) is indeed based on fundementalist tribal/religious reasoning . 
  at last they feel relevant again . 
  russian annoyance stronk . 
  wow first time i 've heard him speak english . 
  the sad thing is though that we only know how to make old decorations , as modern versions of them are very rare . 
  that 's one positive side-effect i hope brexit will have lol . 
   all the public transport . 
  in the entire country , he means . 
  german soul destroyed . 
  well it 's a name . 
  we would n't translate the oyster card as * oesterkaart * either . 
  so crooowwded now though . 
  the increase the past 10 years have been insane . 
   voc state of mind #  orange torrent ah right . 
  do n't worry , we made a [ memorial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf89ullvo5a ) . 
  i 'm actually very surprised .
