  now mind you that we only do the flag thing on special occasions . 
  and even then many people thing it 's too much . 
  ~ ~ nah they moved away man . ~ ~ shunned i say , they were shunned !, 
  i had a family living on my street who would raise the american flag on american holidays . 
  they 're not even american . 
  most people would pronounce it `` schoorel '' though . 
  so * skhhgggskhhhhhhooruhl *, 
  to be fair , the question is not `` do you like this person '' but `` is this person competent '' . 
  romania is so ... big . . ? 
  how come i never noticed that . 
  with turkish flags haging in it . 
  ironic . 
  exactly . 
  ^ or ^ stop ^ delaying ^ ertms ^ implementation, 
  wan na kiss my . . * limburg * ? 
  the reason is that rotterdam itself is a fairly poor city and has wealtier suburbs ( different municipalities ) . 
  usually it 's the other way around here . 
  there are girls on reddit ? 
  nah that 's just how he speaks . 
  why ? 
  having a bigger tax base and more clay looks good in the books and on the maps . 
  especially when you do n't even have to listen to them . 
  did n't know they have salt mines in england . 
  you 're welcome . 
  now kiss my feet . 
  i think he means proost ^ 5, 
   was n't super strong you what now . 
  the guy stayed in the danish habit of pronouncing all of the words like they were stuck in the back of his throat and not pronounce the second half of each word ar all . 
  people have forgotten what the pvda stands for . 
  i could only name `` social-democracy '' and `` welfare distribution and good labour market '' . 
  other parties have this too , they do n't stand out and they have never brought their message in a clear way for over a decade now . 
  because they often get those reactions they have [ made their website available in english ] ( http://www.partyfortheanimals.nl ) . 
  it 's because we get bombarded with american election news . 
  for . 
  two . 
  entire . 
  years . 
  it 's insane . 
  especially with the two party system and all . 
  well that 's because . . your grammar works differently you know . 
  you use different tenses for describing the things/times . 
  for example when learning english we very much have to get used to the idea that one says `` they ** have been ** doing something since ... '' and that that means it 's still going on . . while using a past tense . 
  parliament , not senate . 
  the senate gets elected by the members of the provinces . 
  this campaign they were very populistic ( and unchristian imho ) to steal the right wing vote . 
  examples : getting rid of double passports , singing the national anthem in schools , very refugee-critic, 
  it 's not . 
  it 's pronounced like a spanish j or the gutteral sound in arabic . 
  this should be the top post . 
  [ highly relevant ] ( https://twitter.com/borzou/status/840497502616936448 ) . 
  there 's plenty of informative reddit threads/posts on this issue alone . 
  and the two options you want me to choose from is basically the same thing . 
  thinking that just because you 've heard about him makes him the best candidate . 
  you 're in a foreign media bubble , sad . 
  it 's also only one of the 3 people you 've heard about , because foreign media . 
  even on the right side of the spectrum there 's like 5 parties to choose from . 
  guess which is the one who does n't have concrete goals or actual feasable plans on their 1 a4 size party program ? 
  research has shown that men in blue suits come across as more trustworthy , that 's probably why . 
  `` get rid of the brussels rules '' `` make netherlands ours again '' . 
  a polish death camp . 
  because it does n't get mentioned in the article and in many news story seems to be ommited , let me repeat : the dutch just did n't want a * big public gathering * . 
  while discussions of a potential smaller gathering of the turkish officials inside the consulate were still ongoing , they started threathening us with sanctions on turkish tv . 
  that 's when we called the whole thing off and canceled the foreign minister 's landing rights . 
  then they started calling us fascist and nazis , and then it also turned out the turkish consul outright lied to us . 
  when you 're told you 're not welcome , you can expect being told to go back where you came from if you try to sneak in anyway , like what happened to their minister of family affairs . 
  also , on the radio i heard some turkish official is now again threathening with the eu-turkey immigrant deal `` because europe is broken and has n't fullfilled the agreements anyway '' . 
   the netherlands blocked the flight for reasons of public order and security . 
  not true . 
  they blocked it because turkey started making threats on cnnturk while the negotioations about a possible meetup were still ongoing . 
  getting called names while walking on the street ? 
   harassed in the netherlands how ? 
  just curious . 
  hate is a strong word . 
  there is definitely unease about many of them not adhering to our values and the lack of proper parenting of the male youth . 
  they do n't have to ` act dutch ' . 
  they just have to not act like a turk who 's temporarily living here , cause they 're not . 
  so adapt and participate . 
   they consider themselves turks above dutch . 
  not all of them of course . 
  but yeah even 200 people waving turkish flags and attending the protest in rotterdam is 200 too many imho . 
  you do n't think fvd is a good alternative ? 
  still what ? 
  they can have a meeting if they want . 
  they could even have a meeting with the minister visiting . 
  but not if they do n't co-operate with dutch authorities and even threathen and insult ( which is n't illegal but not very diplomatic ) us . 
  read the [ statement made by the dutch government ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ys4ac/netherlands_revokes_landing_permission_for/deshps2/ ) . 
  we did n't lift the country , we just lifted the water . 
  le lol, 
  you have to realize she 's an icon here and this was super unexpected . 
  if you could keep israel politics out of it for once that would be really great . 
  did n't mean to imply it did . 
  in reverse however , it may have meant that the jews fled to poland as a result . 
  thanks donald . 
   pvv - conservative um , wanting to change core principles of our contitution is conservative how ? 
  i 'd rather call them reactionary or populist . 
  they have both leftist and extreme right elements . 
   conservative in what way ? 
  none of our populist fiscally conservative right wing parties are socially conservative in the broad sense . 
  if you 're into liberalism ( the european sense ) , vnl or fvd might be better suited to your needs . 
   no cpb challenging their plans like that 's a defining trait of populism . .
