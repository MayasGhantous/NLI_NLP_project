  poland was largely spared from the plague as well i believe . 
  the real shame is they 're still not safe from presectution in 2017 . 
  if i 'm not mistaken the volt was sold here for a little while , just before they pulled chevrolet of the european market . 
  i guess it was their last resort option . 
  because people may get confused if it 's not specified . 
  how to make your statistics look unprofessional 101 . 
  fyi : northern european mayonnaise tastes different ( better ) from southern ones . 
  even after rutte said there was a 0 % chance ? 
  i do n't think he mentioned the minder minder thing like before . 
  this was his new stance . 
   if bears walk through my town well it happens . 
   expect that i 'm fluent in french which would be reasonable education policy . 
   europeans do it in their own way , imo . 
  true . 
   i do n't think i will attend one any time soon because it 's not my cup of tea . 
  makes me want to point out a problem : people only know about it from what they see in the media . 
  of course the 1 leather boat in the entire parade is going to make the front pages , but like 90 % of all floats are clothed and all floats have a very clear political message attached to them . 
  to the people constantly critizizing it ( `` i am all for gay rights but why do they have to be so sexual and outrageous '' ) i would want them to actually attend and see what it 's really like before judging . 
  hmmmno , i think the small and bigger meatballs are both called meatballs . 
  i have no words . 
  uk drivers are n't used to ( * cough * willing * cough * ) to give way to cyclists or pedestrians . 
  that 's part to do with rules and part to do with infrastructure , which both are different in the dutch situation . 
  ( i 'm talking about regular side roads , pedestrian crossings and * uitritten * here , let alone roundabouts ) . 
  ok , i 'll rephrase that ; extremist muslims that want to undermine western values . 
   i even think the term `` refugee crisis '' is a gross overstatement already . 
  it 's not though , granted it should be called * migrant crisis * to reflect the actual situation . 
  the term started being used when people were traversing the mediterranean by boat . 
  the situation in greece and italy * is * a crisis . 
  charities picking up people from the libyan coast and dropping them in the eu * is * a crisis . 
  migrants forming a criminal no-go zone in calais * is * a crisis . 
  isis members/supporters easily walking into europe among migrants/refugees * is * a crisis . 
  donald trump has been elected . 
  are you sure ? 
  i do n't think uk drivers are ready for these though . 
  best to start with roundabouts where cyclists have to give way . 
  sure , but they are way more convenient . 
  [ nope , no green space here .

  accents . 
  they exist . 
  nah our bikes are good quality . 
  you can buy 200 ones at decathlon , but they 're not practical or reliable enough ( nor are they fashionable ) . 
  you 're doing it right now . 
  you 're calling it blackface , which is a specific cultural phenomenon from the previous centuries mainly taking place in the us . 
  zwarte piet may * look * like blackface to you , but that does n't mean it * is * blackface . 
  there is plenty of things about zwarte piet we could argue about , but when you 're getting the starting point wrong and already assume all kinds of things and take a biased position from the start , you come across as a clueless misinformed swj foreigner . 
  a comparison : say that the dutch were * so * into burning people with dwarfism at the stake the previous centuries . 
  now they are critizing americans for using them for the portrayal of elves in santa clause movies . 
  * so offensive * , it 's * denigrating and reminds them of burning them at the stake like they used to do there * , while obviously they are paid actors who agreed to be in the movies and have fun doing it . 
  they 're portraying something fantastical , and are not there to be made fun of . 
  you know dwarves in the us have n't been treated fairly until the last couple of decades , but at least they did n't get burned at the stake like in the netherlands . 
  now the dutch are screaming at the americans and accusing them of denigration . 
  `` i watched a hollywood christmas movie the other day and i was * shocked * . 
  they used a * person of little stature * and made him wear hats . 
  unbelievable , what kind of message does this send to the kids ?!, 
  why ca n't they see this is obviously related to the dwarf burnings . '', 
  now you could respond that nobody would mind making movies without elves , but that 's besides the point as zwarte piet is an essential part of the sinterklaas tradition . 
  like the fact santa rides a sleigh . 
  danish pastries are highly overrated . 
  sinterklaas is the evil oppressive shitlord slave master . 
  let your wildest memes come true . ~, 
  150 km/h metro trains would be cool .

  when foreigners tell me they 're `` doing erasmus '' ( european scolarship program ) i still have to think twice . 
  a metro between amsterdam and almere is a good idea , but do know they also increased rail capacity on this corridor . 
  uk and ireland are n't part of schengen . 
  when uk leaves eu it will be a country out of the eu * and * out of schengen . 
  90 % of our bridge steel come from belgium these days . 
  at least there 's humour though . 
  all day long . 
  they eat it up . 
  the facebook fan pages are even worse .

  i mean i 'm pro gay and pro adoption and all , but i really do n't see how this is an eu-issue . 
  damn right i am . 
  saying `` the elderly have been hit hardest during the recession '' when the exact opposite is true is blatantly lying . 
  the elderly are the richest population group . 
  saying we do n't need the 65 to 67 retirement age raise . 
  [ bitch please ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/picasion.com_67eed78f58b0f558969f54ed40415607.gif ) , even now we raised it it probably will still not be sufficient to relieve the pressure . 
  add to that the difficulty in finding affordable housing and stable permanent decent-paying jobs these days , which they 're probably forgetting . 
  youth these days are n't that optimistic , wonder why . 
  so very spicy . 
  was n't implying anything about brexit though , was just talking about modern media and people being willingly uninformed . 
  50plus is dangerous because they play on the feelings of the elderly ( a majority of the population is 50 + ) with lies . 
  litteraly lies . 
  i can easily see them working together with pvv as they 're a powerhungry one-issue party and the pvv also panders to the elderly . 
  but yeah , it 's very divided . 
  from what i can remember the polls are fairly useless though . 
  could be worse , especially if you consider that half a country exists of proper idiots who could easily fall for the populist nonsense . 
  very populist ( in the bad sense ) though . 
  supposedly put there on the former queen 's request . 
  in the same way people outside of italy say ciao . 
  werk is dutch for work lol is dutch for fun wat is dutch for what internetspeak loves us . 
  it 's funny cause walloon people have the same accent in french as the flemish in dutch . 
  truth though , those scandinavian tans look amazing .
