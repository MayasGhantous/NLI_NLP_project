  i guess we 'll just take a page from your book and all put on penis costumes . 
  now that eu-buying power will rise in comparison , prepare for town centres full of annoying young drunk folk . 
  payback time bitches . 
  wtf is wrong with you . 
  wow you have an opinion . 
  let me downvote it . 
  yes , they may be gray , but [ they 're pretty nice ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5pab7r/new_stations_of_the_helsinki_west_metro_expansion/dcr3mg5/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ) if you compare them to new stations worldwide . 
  especially in south america and east asia they 're often verrrryyy utilitarian . 
  even new york city which has a brand new line with 6 less stations ( 3 in total ) and 3 times the budget already looks boring and dated . 
  idk man , i think the noord/zuidlijn is going to look pretty sweet .

  well definitely not check-chee-a . 
  i guess it 's check-ee-a . 
  it 's freezing now , but not enough for ice to get thick enough . 
  have fun getting out . 
  ( hint : no ladders anywhere either ), 
  the upstairs/downstairs hurt me , so that about evens it out . 
  edit : gert was pretty good though, 
  / r/murica too, 
  i think you may want to make some room on some islands . 
  i can feel an asylum wave coming . 
  well first off we already do n't do beating around the bush , and then there 's also the thing of speaking a foreign language , which can be you know , a struggle . 
  dutch people speak english , but most people speak it the way they would speak dutch . 
  if your vocabulary is n't at native speaker level , nuances simply wo n't get translated either . 
  on the other hand , dutch politeness also gets lost in translation . 
  using words like `` could '' in stead of `` can '' makes a sentence polite in dutch , adding `` please '' to it is often not necessary but implied . 
  this is why you will barely hear a dutch person say please in english . 
  at least not with the frequency the british use it , because they just love that word so much . 
  ooh juicyy . 
  correlation : new years eve , muslim youth, 
  own culture , used to be independent , language stuff . 
  so sort of like a not-drunk scotland . 
  many people say he lives in a castle in/near madrid though . 
  because that makes so much sense . 
  we accept eurail and credit cards . 
   feeling both the nostalgia for former france and it 's culture can anyone give any specific examples so i 'm able to understand from an outsiders ' view ? 
  france still seems pretty french to me . 
  nice try / u/icelandair, 
  ta ta, 
  the dutch one is . 
  kerstfeest  kerstmis  christmas . 
  the word kerst is used for ` christmas ' alone , but mis just means mass . 
  sounds kind of petty . 
  nah just eyerolls from me . 
  damage is already done though . 
  they only need to come across a title on facebook and ` theyre taking away our christmas !, 
  from which one ? 
  / r/netherlands is the former one now run by trolls / r/thenetherlands is where everybody moved to, 
   t [ why . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/o_fs4spgyf0?t=2m19s ), 
  he 's offended we pronounce s'es like s'es and not like z 's . 
  lol are you for real . 
  so every time some country does n't like a treaty they 'll just opt-out ? 
  what a great idea , what could possible go wrong . . 
  yet this article actually had the whole story in it instead of a 5 line paragraph incomplete summary . 
  so no , i do n't understand the reasoning . 
  the other article is nowhere to be found anymore either . . 
  hint : nato membership is entirely voluntary . 
  # #makerussiarelevantagain, 
  i do n't see any reason why this would n't scale . 
  eu-wide . 
  or install a boycott . 
  it would have effect . 
  rule of law is pedantic . 
  if he had said * that * , there literally would be no issue right now . 
  i feel like `` souvenez-vous '' would be more appropriate ? 
  the saudi king needs to seize full power , oust those that are not beneficial and then should become a benevolent dictator and lead a transition into democracy . 
  many names have been frenchified or dutchified or have names in both languages . 
  it all comes down to politics really . 
   saudi arabia is a member , despite only being half the economy of the netherlands for its oil of course . 
  turkey is a member , despite being economically smaller than the netherlands . 
  i get a massive willem boner from this . 
  worth pointing out that geel translates to just `` yellow '' . 
  in other germanic languages the distinction seems clearer though . 
  a people = volk/folk/etc . 
  only when they 're brand new . 
  do n't forget to look at the map . 
  do n't forget to look at the map . 
  it 's all [ relative ] ( http://www.petersfietssite.nl/pics/ahn-nederland.jpg ) . 
   the same goes for den bosch / 's - hertogenbosch . 
  den bosch is not its official name , so you wo n't find it on instituational signage anywhere . 
  mr. hitler, 
  ( every dutch city is ) ( ps they 're pink ), 
  `` well there 's this one church . '', 
  well they did treat it as a nationwide prestige project . 
  results is still average though , you can find this kind of style in many places . 
  ooh , funsies . 
  now let 's uk-ify them : yemouth [ eyemuth ] amsteldam middleborough oxford ( coevorden ) horn burnfield emsford peatdam reed church delved mount-on-mound lord hugo squire lely ( lilly ) city endby ( eindhoven ) heimskirk maintown ( hoofddorp , not on the map ) siricsea dukeforst meusefunnle rurmouth rosedale of course there 's already : flushing , the hague , hook of holland , brill , ryswick , sluys, 
  many of these names are guesses . 
  it 's just a pizza in a different shape . 
  not at all bad . 
  you do n't * have * to , but are highly encouraged to . 
  for recycling the collected plastic is trucked to . . you guessed it : germany . 
  well then [ renovate ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/68/3f/aa/683faa22b5dd8fba29fe386de2124245.jpg ) them instead of tearing them down . 
  [ not bad at all ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/57/34/79/5734797b7d32c59a301511629bd005ba.jpg ) . 
  sure , but i bet if they were part of the eu the border controls would still be as strict . 
  i mean when a flight from curacao lands they get the sniffing dogs out for gods sake . 
   all european national languages they do in a lot , but not all . 
  sure , belgium , netherlands and scandinavian people understand english , but it does n't stand a chance of becoming a major channel here unless they add more voice overs and cover the whole spectrum . 
  i do wish them to succeed , but if they want to , they need more marketing because i bet 90 % of people have never heard of the channel here .
