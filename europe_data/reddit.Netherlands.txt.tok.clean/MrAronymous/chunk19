  i bet even tv5monde has better brand recognition . 
  i thought it was like 5 or something but it turns out they have expanded their reach . 
  still not covering all though . 
  for it to be truely pan-european i feel like they 'd have to do the voice overs in all european national languages . 
  that way they 'd get a better position on the channel lists and be more relevant to the viewers . 
  yet we 're still shit at it . 
  the basics are easy for us though . 
  ai is scary anyway . 
  so why has n't he filed for bankrupcy ages ago ? 
  ` swamp is n't real nature ' . 
  that 's why we drained most of it and turned it into flat grassy fields . 
  now * that * is nature . 
  i do n't think you 'll really get judged based off off those stereotypes here though , except by judgemental assholes who will judge anyone without good reason . 
  as croatia has more and more media presence and is gaining in tourism popularity the perceptions will change , but it does n't happen in a year . 
  hey , it 's not my fault these are the stereotypes that exist . 
  `` balkan '' to us = shitty music , keep dividing their countries every couple of years we ca n't keep up , poverty , come here to be criminal, 
  i just want to confirm that this is how more dutch people ( incl me ) look at it . 
  from the way we perceive things , even if it may not that logical technically . 
  dickcheese is the key to russian succes . 
  got it . 
  greece wat r u doin, 
  the car is a lincoln , only available in america , so checks out . 
  yeah but you can see green stuff through the glass so it does n't always feel like you 're driving through sao paolo .

  i 'm afraid france will run out of streets to name presidents after . 
  all of the street names in most cities are very predictable . 
  worth pointing out the orangy bits ( at least post 2010 ) are all [ greenhouses ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/medias.photodeck.com/c9401844-c35a-11e3-88ed-f2b86e40979d/79091_xgaplus.jpg ) . 
  so basically just farm land , but covered . 
  [ quick video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgv7nr6qqji ), 
  even if it were only an economic union , with the schengen open borders treaty it by became political anyway . 
   where is that ? 
  what countries are we talking about where that happens ? 
  the same country as the parade . 
  it 's a small word after all looks too intense for me . 
  could be american expats organizing a float . 
  but not it 's definitely stalkers . 
  * transgenerified us flags, 
  thank you for letting me have my own opinion . 
  everybody kept going on about it like it 's supposed to be the greatest place on earth , but i found it pretty mediocre architecture-wise and was let-down . 
  so overrated tbh . 
   need to identify as their sexuality thing is , most people do n't . 
  you identify as what you like . 
  many gay people like female stuff . 
  is it because straight men avoid girly stuff ( they might like ) because they feel the great urge to be manly ? 
  do gays have a different brain ? 
  who knows . 
  all i know is when i grew up and got made fun of or being a feminine boy and got told to ` act normal ' , i did n't know how . 
  because i was being myself and did the things i liked . 
  then puberty came and i caved under the pressure an tried to be normal . 
  did n't work . 
  also did n't make me any happier . 
  it 's the trump thing that triggers many of these people . 
  yesterday 's photo of amsterdam pride was pretty tame . 
  it 's a protest against the trans ban in the military ( and the trans controversy in general ) . 
  on the front of the float there was lady liberty waving the usa ( with [ trans flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/transgender_pride_flag.svg/1280px-transgender_pride_flag.svg.png ) colours ) flag . 
  uh , there was another one , posted yesterday .

  it looks cool !, 
  you should turn it into your little las vegas with theaters , bars and entertainment . 
  is the word cunning related to the word cunt in any way . 
  serious question . 
  i feel stupid for asking , but is this a real story ? 
  to be honest the percentage of eggs with shit on them is really really tiny . 
  it 's more common to find one small feather in a box . 
  i love it when a sudden internet female appears . 
  belgians are always to blame . 
  that 's the protective layer . 
  but you guys love italians .

  belgian company that made the poisonous stuff . 
  it 's still that way in our law book . 
  the title of the function is king . 
  when it 's a woman she actually becomes king , but we call her queen . 
  that 's why there ca n't be * another * king , because then there 'd technically be 2 . 
  curved bananas,

  idk , rotterdam still feels empty at a lot of times and a lot of locations . 
  high buildings do n't equal vibrancy . 
  black sand , not even once . 
  expat facilities , only place with a remotely ` big city ' feel , most stuff to do , most international schools in the area , japanese community nearby , close to the airport , etc. 
  they could go to the hague and bore themselves .

  i know , i just added an extra bit of information . 
  you 're welcome . 
  we actually call it the pyramide van austerlitz eventhough our word is spelled piramide . 
  you 're welcome . 
  also , where did these kids learn to spell . 
  it 's noord-holland , zuid-holland , west-friesland , oost-friesland . 
  noord brabant is correct though , keeping future planned expansions in mind . 
   low countries nether lands, 
  nah , it just means i 'm -1.75 m instead of -1.86 m,
