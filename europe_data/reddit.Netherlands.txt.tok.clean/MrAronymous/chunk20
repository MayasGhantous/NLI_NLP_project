  well i did n't say it 's the most optimal building material * everywhere * . 
  but here it certainly is . 
  note that most buildings are made using concrete nowadays . 
  we use bricks as finishing on top of an isolation layer . 
  it 's way more durable and requires less maintenance . 
  our climate really is n't suited for wood or plaster which you would have to repaint nearly every year . 
  cold , heat , moist , algae , we have it all . 
  the main reason why we use it is that we 're used to it and like the look of it . 
  the fact that you can use it in modern ways and make endless of brick varities help it seem not old fashioned . 
  as of lately a lot of bigger buildings tend to use [ prefabricated facades ] ( http://www.presigno.de/wp-content/uploads/900-mahler_02.jpg ) , which is easiest [ hidden ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bfqhmyg.jpg ) with bricks . 
  damn he really looks his age here . 
  i like it too , but not everywhere , all the time . 
  the fact that you can look at any major high-rise city and they all look very much alike is sad . 
  that 's why i love [ taipei 101 ] ( http://www.taipei-101.com.tw/upload/news/201502/2015021711505431705145.jpg ) . 
  it does n't even have to be classical . 
  just more elaborate . 
  jugendstil and ( futuristic ) art deco are both very distinctive in style and have elaborate decorations , yet they are n't classical . 
  currently we 're in the middle of a major change in society with the dawn of the internet and new electronic inventions , but it 's not reflected anywhere in architectural decorations . 
  the only new thing you currently see is the eco theme ( b/c climate change ) . 
  that 's why i 'm a big fan of things like [ this ] ( http://kekness.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/stainedglass_frontfacade_stefanglerum_1164.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://www.amsterdamwoont.nl/assets/am73586-1-e1482215958837.jpg ) . 
  there 's so much you can do with computerized stuff , or 3d-printing . 
  and it gives the buildings personality . 
  luckily where i 'm from most buildings are still in brick , [ even ] ( http://www.gebouwvanhetjaar.nl/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/1-c9c6b3836973130b354a2bc9bbf32fb1/2015/03/14.jpg ) modern [ ones ] ( http://miesarch.com/uploads/images/works/263-1736.jpg ) . 
  like , i would n't hate [ this ] ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1872615 ) ( though it 's a bit extreme ) . 
  ca n't believe it 's drunk more than spa + fruit, 
  i had to draw some maps from ireland the other day . 
  the amount of ballys is staggering . 
  i thought it was common knowlege to take pictures of the car before you hand it in ? 
  free bickys for all . 
  maybe try dutch . 
  i know . 
  now if you could actually answer the question . 
  why are you answering a question with a different question . 
  do you * really * think that that 's what this is about ? 
  why are n't they bringing them to safe tunisian shore . 
  but it already has hop !, 
  and transavia, 
  wo n't anyone think of the conjoined twins ? 
  implying scandinavia is poor . 
  norwegians bathe in oil and swedes have volvo 's as their `` bread and butter '' car brand . 
  that shit is luxury yo . 
  parking comes included , as is specified in the [ contract ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_london_ ( 1839 \\ ) ) . 
  the song basically means ' i hope i get sex tonight ' . 
  awkies when you think about it . 
  [ i wrote some things here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5db9r1/disneyland_paris_v_disneyland_californiadisney/da444m1/ ) if you have more detailed questions let me know . 
  nethersaxonia/nedersaksen/niedersachsen fits perfectly into the * netherlands/nederland/niederlande * theme . 
  they still have that one in berlin , partly . 
  we could build on that . 
   anti climate or anti weed cough ^ pvv cough, 
  exonyms get me so hard . 
  we 'll revive the regional languages and within a generation they will be able to master dutch as well . 
  are there no girls or boys only ( boarding ) schools left in the uk ? 
  i 'm sorry you feel that way . 
  it 's lifted/lowered by somebody on site . 
  it 's a url . 
  what more could you want . 
  people pissing in these  people pissing against old buildings, 
  [ it 's real ] ( http://www.visserensmitbouw.nl/dynamics/modules/sfil0200/view.php?fil_id=5646 ), 
  there 's free wigs available . 
  that 's no real excuse though . 
  we use zoab asphalt which is great for reducing noise and water spray , but deteriorates faster when it freezes . 
  using it and replacing it more often is a choice we made . 
   south america not a mess learn to read , child : the mess * that africa is *  the entire place is an extremely violent , poor shithole . 
  oh wait you were just trolling . 
  carry on then . 
  ever since we got schengen there 's these crowds off southern and eastern european men coming here by tour bus to photograph our women taking a piss . 
  they focus primarily on blondes and brunettes . 
  it 's become such a nuisance , because their cameras flash and click so much , that the city has started to give out permits so only 4 cameramen can photograph women at a wc at a time . 
  if they leave the city they have to hand in the physical card which then can be passed on to others . 
  the profits the city made with the earnings of such permit is so big that we can build a new metro line with it . 
  it 's become a real part of the amsterdam globalised economy . 
  exactly . 
  just look at this [ multifunctional sink ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t32ttbitmj8 ) . 
  we even got the females [ covered ] ( http://urilift.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vrouwenurinoir-op-dam-amsterdam.jpg ) !, 
  sure , the connection with noord can be improved . 
  that 's what this metro line will do . 
  most amsterdammers really do n't know how much this will impact them . 
  new metro lines are huge , especially a centrally located one like this one . 
  the trams running on top of the line currently are * tjokvol * . 
  so it 's not only accomodating future growth , but current demand as well . 
  i have no single doubt the noordzuidlijn wo n't be a success . 
  in fact , i think people will get used to it so quickly they 'll be asking for more metro . 
  because that 's the deal currently : it 's easy to get to and from the center , but it 's not easy to get from one end of the city to the other . 
  and as the center is becoming more touristic the city is becoming more polycentral ( west , indische buurt , arena , etc. ) . 
  that 's why metros are good , cause they are great for the longer distances ( a la bijlmer ) . 
  trams are great too , but the on-street ( sometimes mixed-use ) traffic can make them pretty unreliable and slow . 
  that 's why i 'm in favour of the ` controversial ' [ new transit model ] ( https://www.ovmagazine.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gvb_huidig-en-nieuw-netwerk.jpg ) the city is adopting ( it 's also the most efficient use of funds/material ) . 
  i have actually never seen this side of it . 
  i thought they were fakes . 
  well duh . 
  all of russia is basically one big crimea sanction . 
   and parts of the old city center are collapsing as a result collapsing does n't mean what you think it does . 
  and some buildings sank about 20cm at 1 location only . 
   the whole project is the perfect example of the sunk cost fallacy . 
  is it though ? 
  even if the current costs would double it would still be worth it . 
  it 's what the city needs desperately . 
   nieuwmarkt station meh , i do n't know what you 're moaning about . 
  the artwork is fairly unique , i like it .
