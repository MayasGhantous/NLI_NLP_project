  it 's going to be renovated next year anyway . 
  it 's paradise compared to the new york subway that many seem to admire for its ` urban look ' . 
   few dozen meters per year bull . 
  shit . 
  the tunnel boring was n't the problem . 
   almost every european city i 've been to , i 've had public transport envy true , gvb is shitty . 
  but if they 're not getting more money there 's little they can do . 
  hell , they even had their national government subsidies cut from 100 million to 36 million . 
  people moan about gvb all the time , but nobody lays blame on the city or national government . 
  also , the bikes everywhere is why we do n't have better public transport . 
  bit of a chicken and egg story . 
  athens , [ eat ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c7nkmyhxwaaofbj.jpg:large ) your [ heart ] ( http://wijnemenjemee.nl/admin/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170404-centraal-station-noordzuidlijn-bouwupdate-ge-dubbelman-16-1200x800.jpg ) out . 
  limburg messing up our score, 
  plenty . 
  god damn i hate purposefull contextless misquotes . 
  how does this carry any weight at all, 
   the flat fields considered such an important landscape it 's most of the landscape we have , lol . 
  and yes , it gets used for recreation and such . 
  we 're already very densely populated , so every bit of green space is valuable , especially right in between cities . 
  dear leader, 
  any data on if it 's actually used much ? 
  seems like a lot of money when humans are able to just swim across and might not even use it . 
  you can just ask for no ice . 
  $ 2.50 for 250ml is expensive . 
  in the us you pay slightly less and get refills . 
   belgian beach ok now that 's a [ terrifying thought ] ( https://cdn.prezly.com/cd/2706f04fb511e5ad3bfdc11e0c0c33/archibelge_kust_graded_20---kopie.jpg ) . 
  it 's a bat/bike bridge and a bat crossing . 
  the thing was brand new . 
  it needs time to settle and let the water ecosystem flourish . 
  i present to you a [ bat/bike bridge ] ( http://architizer-prod.imgix.net/media/1479499629702e8fc365e966b7292c17561ca9ad20e6f.jpg?q=60&amp;auto=format,compress&amp;cs=strip&amp;w=1680 ) and a [ bat crossing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tasv9hz.jpg ) . 
  nope . 
  natura 2000 might have . 
  though i have heard they have * free refills * there . 
  i 'll take all the downvotes i can get if that means the truth will finally rise . 
  let 's not kid ourselved . 
  belgian fries are way overrated . 
   digged deep into the full extent like ? 
  to be fair i think that attitude has diminished over the years though . 
  anyone who wants to do a eli5 on soros and his opponents ? 
  * cries in broken italian trains *, 
  stop this . 
  rotterdam has a small dick, 
  founded here by two german guys . 
  same for c&a . 
  but p&c only has 3 stores here , advertising is nonexistent and name recognition is barely a thing among the younger generation . 
  their brand is so dead here now . 
  to no surprise , their offerings are highly ` meh ' as well . 
  dam - rak * dam , barring of a river . 
  now the main city square ( amstel + dam ) * rak = straight navigable waterway . 
  the street is named after [ the canal ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.3768264,4.8987423,3a,55.3y,225.29h,91.13t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sfk8vlrbqfo5-ogj39cv78a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  damrak is the street and canal between central station ( on the station island ) and dam square . 
  the damrak used to be amsterdam 's main port as it opened up directly to the [ zuiderzee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zuiderzee ) . 
  goods were [ weighed on dam square ] ( http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=urn:gvn:ubl01:p319n004&amp;size=large ) and traded in the nearby [ exchange building ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ntdj1vkz2si/vrkqwi9twsi/aaaaaaaaaca/-ta_uzz74d4/s1600/%25e9%2598%25bf%25e5%25a7%2586%25e6%2596%25af%25e7%2589%25b9%25e4%25b8%25b9%25e4%25ba%25a4%25e6%2598%2593%25e6%2589%2580%2528%25e4%25b8%2580%2529.jpg ) ( [ current one ] ( http://media.schlijper.nl/high/16/11/21/161121-img-9204-damrak.jpg ) directly behind the photographer ) .

  ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-km_szwym8qc/usv7dhfjrpi/aaaaaaaabjk/mqw2y8491mo/s1600/b.jpg ), 
  because the street most people first see when entering the city was [ an embarrasment ] ( https://www.straatbeeld.nl/static/site/img/module/content/article/1584/archive/picture.jpg ) . 
  no pretty neon , just shitty cheap ass tourist stores and revolting hotels . 
  in an effort to clean up the area the city redid the paving and [ banned big tacky signage ] ( http://media.schlijper.nl/high/16/11/21/161121-img-9204-damrak.jpg ) . 
  you still wo n't find a single amsterdammer there but at least it 's less fugly . 
  so you 're saying we should erase the actual shooting part from the books then ? 
  because it 's in there for a reason , after other steps have preceded even . 
  yes . 
  according to sovereignty and ( international ) laws . 
  no but what you now are proposing is israel stopping the blockades and let itself be attacked . 
  we both know that 's not in israels best interest and not very logical . 
  so to get rid of the blockades there would have to be a plan . 
  as long as there is no plan it makes no sense to judge them for * what any country would do * . 
  ( usa is n't under direct violent attack from mexico , fyi ) i do n't think anyone here is defending the israelis making settlements and colonies or seizing palestinian assets the way they are now . 
  but that 's a different issue from the wall and blockades . 
  you did n't answer the first part of my question . 
  we can all sit around the campfire and sing kumbayah as long as we want but reality is not everybody shares the same vision regarding peace . 
  how would you propose stopping cross-border attacks . 
  fuck no . 
  especially because most of them get repeated after 2 months . 
  i 've basically seen all small italian mountain villages and european parliaments by now . 
  ok so let 's say israel would stop the blockade . 
  what do you think would happen and what should happen regarding cross-border attacks . 
  sounds exactly like the german youtube situation . 
  o u t r a g e, 
  sweeping through europe, 
  all that sand gets so tiresome /, 
  always reminds me of that kpn woman voice . 
  headbob to tatu . 
   sergey lazarev is this a thing ? 
  i want it to be a thing . 
  conformity . 
  you know , as someone from the amsterdam region i do n't find this to be the correct representation . 
  i knew this stereotype ( niet lullen maar poetsen , etc. ), 
  when going to rotterdam for school , but found it was n't as black and white as you portrayed at all . 
  while it 's true amsterdammers love their city and are n't uh . . shy about it , it 's * not * true rotterdam does n't have it 's fair share of over the top pride either . 
  maybe they know how to package it better , but you * constantly * hear people talk about how rotterdam is * so amazing * . 
  they would get jingoistic as fuck , even when i did n't compare cities or mention amsterdam at all , and even in class material . 
  now i 'm not talking regular ` city pride ' , which is a thing that exists . 
  but claiming to be god 's gift to the country [ in a particular field ] without even having the statistics to back it up ( sometimes even the contrary ) . 
  sure rotterdam has plenty of nice areas and great people , but whenever you dare to suggest that some areas are n't actually that nice to be in or that some things could be better people are ready to grab their pitchforks . 
  it 's the 2nd city of the country , you 'd think they 'd have thicker skin . 
  any fair criticism of rotterdam is downvoted on / r/thenetherlands too . 
  calimero behavior in full force , which is sad , because the city does n't need it . 
  it 's not investors . 
  cities are trendy and booming again all over the world .
