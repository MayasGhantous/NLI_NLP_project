  the city of rotterdam is incredibly slow in developing and approving new projects ( they * bezuinigd * a huge part of their city planning department which does n't help either ) . 
  may i remind you that in 2016 rotterdam only built 750 new homes . 
  compare that to groningen which built 901 or amsterdam with 5038 . 
  well i do n't think they * moved * them . 
  same for amsterdam . 
  nobody comes here because the canal belt is on the list , they come here because it 's amsterdam . 
  history-purists/fanatics use the unesco label for every damn thing they want to build 5km away but would be visible from the canal belt . 
  news flash , the land is flat , if you build anything higher than 30 meters it will be seen from miles away . 
  you need to have valid proof of identity . 
  for police checks ( legally you need to be able to identify yourself at all times , they 'll fine you when you 're being a cunt , in most cases they will let it slide , hell in most cases they do n't even ask ) a drivers license would suffice . 
  for filling in tax forms or some other official documents it would n't , so you 'd need either an id card or passport . 
  most people only have 1 of those two . 
  less students using government subsidies to use trains is less problems ( crowded trains ) for ns . 
  studentenreisproduct ? 
  that 's thanks to the government , not ns . 
  [ they already have one . 
  my personal conviction is that boterham has derived from broterham . 
  as in a * ham * of * brood * . 
  ham meaning [ * cut off piece * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/hoekwater_polderkaart_-_polder_buiksloterham.png ) and * brood * meaning bread . 
  spicy, 
  it would look better with an orange background . 
  i 'm not sure but i think because then you do n't have to put ugly ass country code sticker on your car anymore . 
  * it has been a while * it used to be , for a long time, 
  fucking belgians stealing our architecture . 
  let 's hope not . 
  all i see is a car park . 
  let 's just name it macodenia . 
  * st paddy 's day, 
  why do you think so ? 
  they 'll blame the brexit negotiations/deal next . 
  ah right . 
  yeah your road design is shit . 
  he was talking 50 km/h roads and faster . 
  30 km/h zones are fine . 
  truly one of our best export products . 
  hiking vs. living there . 
  yeah . 
  until you want to walk somewhere . 
  no fun . 
  * putain * noun f ( plural putains ) * ( vulgar ) whore , hooker * ( derogatory , vulgar , slang ) bitch , cow ( an unpleasant woman ) * bloody , fucking * \u00c9teins cette putain de t\u00e9l\u00e9 !, 
  like pietro boselli 's uglier twin . 
  they could cal him putin , but you know , well . . 
  did they redo the lighting ? 
   country 's landscape but you 're into actual landscapes , stick to the south . 
  good luck trying to run into loud stoned british tourists in [ amersfoort ] ( https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/stonepro/media/original/entity/24/419152/koppelpoort_amersfoort_2008.jpg ) .

  now where have i seen this before . . 
  what / u/not-an-account fails to mention is that the us `` mid-size '' category in eu speak would be a large car . 
  those sell less well over here because families here get hatchbacks or station wagons . 
  that 's why most of the sedans here are luxurious vehicles . 
  [ c-segment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/car_classification ) ( compact ) cars are the biggest market . 
  and in our cities . 
  my dad 's at a company where if he has a problem he has to file a report that gets troubleshot in india . 
  shit takes forever and his case will be passed around endlessly . 
  then when they finally commit to it they do n't know what they 're doing at all . 
  he reckons that the outsourcing is actually more time consuming/expensive than a smaller amount of higher skilled workers over here . 
  however it 's not encouraged or polite to do so . 
  the us would be at the bottom a hundred years ago when there were entire cities with all kinds of alive different european languages . 
  nowadays , not so much , save for some spanish areas . 
   necessary to learn dutch it is in many cases if you want to keep your residence permit . 
  when were you a kid ? 
  because there 's been both subbed and dubbed shows for as long as i can remember . 
   i actually would love if we just switched to english in the entire country at one point in the future . 
  brb throwing up . 
  haha we had [ a similar thing . 
  he 's saying that customers are n't aware of what 's around ( pan-european film promotion is pretty meagre . 
  i saw a film poster for a ( non art house ) french film the other day and i was surprised ) and that the budgets are n't comparable . 
  us budgets are n't even remotely close to local european film budgets or subsidies . 
  the fact that there 's different languages and media markets is n't helping either . 
  remember budget does n't mean quality . 
  all you have to do is look at some hollywood remakes . 
  hollywood has so much more money for advertising as well . 
  they should . 
  instead of these quoatas they should just make it easier to make pan-european stuff . 
  a single media market or subsidies or whatever . 
  regulations that games sold in europe must have * all the * european languages subtitled , that kind of stuff . 
  but there is no eu-wide single media market . . 
  they become royal devils when they 're hungry . 
  sorry bad taste , i know . 
  russia and its satellite states have an awful lot of corruption and ineffective governance, 
  it 's relatively safe , prosperous and lies in te middle eastern ( distance , food , climate , etc. ), 
  but i guess you were n't really asking . 
  erdogan is n't dumb . 
  just evil . 
  jesus what is wrong with you people . 
  the third one is beaut . 
  ukraines win did n't either , so would n't count on it . 
  i would applaud the effort though . 
  to ban americans in all cabins of flights to europe , officials say, 
   souvlaki shit man i 'm getting urges now, 
  i do call urk and volendam backwards . 
  but not at all because they wear costumes . 
  some isolated ( `` backwards '' / traditional ) villages yes . 
  and farmers . 
  they 're great against moist and cold conditions . 
  they are also safe for working with machinery or horses . 
  dutch dialect master race . 
  p for porn . 
  it does n't say fairit\u00e9 anywhere .
