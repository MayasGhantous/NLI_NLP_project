  i do n't think a rise , but rather more people are expressing it . 
  i love that you often copy our [ street designs ] ( https://vremdemirror.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/p1010954.jpg ) . 
  but please copy more , because you need it . 
  in certain neighbourhoods . . unfortunately . 
  it 's not accepter by the bigger public but the surinamese are used to it i guess . 
  wna cawa no wocce n cocana cywky no problem at all . 
   zo 'n zeveraars my beautiful dutch virgin eyes . 
  whyy . 
  it 's alright , but not cheap . 
  train we have a local commuter train service , which is basically an s-bahn/rer that goes across the country . 
  then there 's intercity trains which are n't really intercity as they stop in more places than just city centers . 
  then there 's the high speed line which failed . 
  currently they 're still running with temporary trains that are maxed to 160km/h , while the [ failing trains ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fyra ) were supposed to go 250 km/h , linking amsterdam and rotterdam in half an hour . 
  massive costs overruns and still no new trains eventhough they should have been running in 2012 ( though they have been ordered ) . 
  there 's also regional trains that used to be the loss-making sections of the national network . 
  they get tendered for a 10 year period to private parties , and service there has improved loads . 
  amsterdam as for local ( amsterdam ) transit , it 's ok . 
  the trams are overcrowded . 
  we would have ordered longer trams in 2001 but a major branch on the network does n't allow it because of the [ bridge stops ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/amsterdam,+prinsengracht+ ( leidsestraat ) / @ 52.3650145,4.8842998,74 m/data = ! 3m1 ! 1e3 ! 4m5 ! 3m4 ! 1s0x47c609e9ad28e763 :0 x7c4ea9f9433a41c2 ! 8m2 ! 3d52 .3649687 ! 4d4 .8844768 ) . 
  some tram lines are being scrapped because of budget cuts , but there 's also new trams on order to replace older stock . 
  through the city center there 's a metro line under construction . 
  many people thought it was a waste of money , but looking at the overcrowded trams , it 's right on time . 
  well , not literally , as it 's been under construction for 18 years now and is 12 years late . 
  it 's also going to be at least twice as expensive . 
  but it 's well worth it imho . 
  the other metro lines are alright , but not very reliable and announcements and service updates are severely lacking . 
  friendliness by employees is also next to non-existant , we need to learn from rotterdam in that regard . 
  many stations are undergoing renovations now , so that 's nice . 
  in the region many bus lines have been transformed into semi-brt , so busways are continuously being built . 
  suburban bus service is kind of mweh . 
  at least it 's mostly < 30 minute services , otherwise why even bother . 
  but public transit has big competition from bikes here . 
  the free ferry services are also very overcrowded due to new-gained popularity of amsterdam-noord . 
  personally i would like to see more metro . 
  eventhough the distances generally are n't that great , from my house ( near amsterdam ) i can get to rotterdam central quicker than to amsterdam-noord . 
  that 's messed up . 
  the new metro line being built will fix that for me personally , but we need to link the city together . 
  currently all the trams go to central station , which has been that way for over a 100 years , but it needs updating . 
  there 's only so much you can do to speed up the trams on crowded and windy streets . 
  `` never heard of it . '', 
  `` holland '' `` ahh holland , very nice , lots of smokey smokey and women heh hahahahaa '', 
  well are they ? 
  uh , yeah mostly because it would be like 1/3 of the population . 
  i love how my name actually works . 
  you are n't the first to misread it . 
  i was looking for it next to you name but could n't find it . 
  fixed it / lol, 
  how , what , where ? 
  north : down to earth , sto\u00efc , protestant , w\u00f6rk , patat south : convivial , crony , catholic , enjoy , friet west : arrogant , loud , crowded rest : boorish , small-minded , boring, 
  yep . 
  the provinces do n't do a whole lot , so there 's talks of unifying flevoland , noord-holland and utrecht to save costs . 
  they fail to recognize that even though the provinces do n't do a lot of visible things , it 's still part of the regional identity . 
  less so in flevoland ^ est. 
  ^ 1986 and utrecht , but surely still in holland . 
  that moment when you 're not subreddit famous . 
  sigh . 
  i put the chairs on the dick .
