  british/irish are very distinctive . 
  how can [ this woman ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2016/10/25/jane-beedle-blue-xlarge_trans_nvbqzqnjv4bq1enfw7ltxodnt2rcc0pqyezk6pyw0j8drxcwbrvkd7a.jpg ) be anything other than british ? 
  the [ rooney ] ( http://www.manutd.com/sitecore/shell/~/media/374aa068c74a419ebc844d25cdc93eb2.ashx?w=240&amp;h=311&amp;rgn=0,0,2000,2592 ) face or what i call the ' [ british inbred face ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/73/d4/5b/73d45bb4bb9c48bfead62eb3f4d1bee3.jpg ) ' ( sorry bit rude ( ca n't find a perfect picture ) ) is also very recognizable . 
   they have this typical jawline not mad about it, 
  to be honest i could n't recognize any slav language apart from polish and russian/ukranian . 
  smooth , often relatively cluttered with signs , sometimes big humps in the road because of soil conditions . 
   meyer ( mayor ) why did i not know this . 
  try to be less simplistic . 
  more like sinterklaas threats . 
  `` i 'll write to sinterklaas about your behavior '' . 
  interesting question . 
  our modern housing is still going strong 1 2 3 4 but after the modern-only 90s , retro styles ( because it 's definitely still current architecture ) have come into favour , especially 1930s or 1880s style . 
  1 2 3 4 brick is still very much the dominant exterior finish . 
  it 's not considered old or new , just the default . 
  loading up the caravan to go to a kids-friendly camping in southern france or spain ? 
  i wonder how many of those snacks are of dutch origin . 
  sounds something a teen girl would scream to her little brother . 
  [ it true . 
  i 'd love to go on a date with a big afrikaans bloke . 
  the language sounds kind of wild/savage compared to modern dutch , so it 'd be kind of tarzan-like . 
  but do n't know if it would get annoying after a while though . 
  shag = fucking magaluf is spanish party town, 
  shag = fucking magaluf is spanish party town, 
  like jeckyll and hide but with alcohol instead of serum and without the muscles . 
   i just ca n't wait to jump into my hugo boss you ca n't ? 
  but so well crafted . 
  so stylish . 
  quick rundown if they 're settled down and fully integrated into society nobody complains . 
  their music and arts are celebrated . 
  if they 're less integrated into society they 're white trash . 
  think lower education level , high teen pregnancy/teen brides , possibly higher crime levels , less socially acceptable behavior . 
  if they 're not integrated into society at all they 're most likely criminal , disrespectful and moochers , taking advantage of society . 
  longer period of high temperatures than normal . 
  of course we have ben & jerry 's , it 's [ dutch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unilever ) . 
  kidding , sort of . 
  pretty sure most grocery stores sell ice cream . 
  if not for tubs of ice cream they will have a small fridge with packaged in our language we call it ijs ( ice ) , or ijsje ( icicle , as in little ice ) . 
  when you want to specify the kind of ice cream you put on a cone we call it roomijs ( ice cream ) . 
  water based ice cream is called . . wait for it . . waterijs ( water ice ) . 
  gelato is just regular roomijs as far as i 'm concerned . 
  frozen yoghurt has only been a thing here for like 5 years and it 's not available in super markets . 
  sorbets often get grouped together with roomijs because of the similar way it gets served . 
  i bet there 's plenty of people who would n't know the difference between the two . 
  now i have no idea what custard is , other than the thing you put in baked goods , but i 'm assuming it 's roomijs ? 
  are you dutch ? 
  do you smoke a lot of weed lolololololol, 
  shoes . 
  also socks , slippers or nothing .

  what do they think the commonwealth is ? 
  we like to feel like we are though . 
   off-season to visit amsterdam sorry , 5 years too late for that, 
  not really . 
  do n't think we need to grow much more . 
  with automation and already dense country with traffic and housing problem do n't think it 's necessary . 
  baby boomers are about to die off , so a whole segment of the market will disappear anyway .

  jeep 's alive and well . 
  i see the renegade fairly often . 
  must 've been a success for them . 
   for a reliable day-to-day car . 
  plus there is nothing available , except for niche vehicles like the odd cadillac or jeep . 
  despite their american ownership , ford and opel are often considered european brands . 
   tesla the more you subsidize electric , the more you 'll see them . 
  i see them all the time . 
  if you want a simple minded primitive lifestyle , stay in rural usa . 
   i wanted a good 4x4 when i eventually move over there that 's smallish and wo n't require any abnormal fuel usage so you bought a fiat panda 4x4 ?

  yeah but still , even if i look at other places the prices are steep and 50 % to 100 % more expensive . 
  apple made it so easy for us though , you never have to remember a conversion rate !,

  at the local florist here this would cost about $ 25 . 
   de lijn should be mentioned that it 's government-owned .

  they mowed the grass themselves though .
