  typical dutch bread is airy . 
  german bread is dense . 
  and yet i wonder if you even sell something as simple as a good dutch bread which is both light on the stomach and tasty at the same time . 
  slices of bread with cheese or meat . 
  anglosphere , sure . 
  but with most lumping together it 's not really about language , so then british commonwealth comes into play . 
  would be nice , but i do n't think i could . 
  us dutch love having influenced other parts of the world . 
  it 's cool to see dutch place names and family names still in use . 
  we think it 's funny people from abroad still relate to us in [ some ways ] ( http://imgur.com/a/psoi2 ) . 
  however when you see the oversized pick-up trucks , chlorinated canal and you realise it 's just bunch of republican religious dicks , we quickly lose interest . 
  hypocrits, 
  i find tiping is too common . 
  so i only round off awkward numbers and do n't go throwing around cash just because i can . 
  i would n't do it at h&m or the bus driver , so i wo n't do it in a caf\u00e9 either . 
  it comes at a price though . 
  flemish are the most socially awkward people of europe and they [ barely ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nkj3lanzgdi/urlwi1vc0vi/aaaaaaaaasc/kwgxpmkpszm/s1600/lintbebouwing2.png ) have any places with open nature left . 
  it 's a pretty well established fact that silicon valley provides start-ups more capital and opportunity ( also more risk involved ) . 
  a lot of local start-ups here are only able to get the funding in the us , and that 's why they move their offices or get bought up . 
  it 's a known problem that governments and the eu is already trying to address . 
  reminds me of that time when danish cycling experts were measuring statistics to determine the ` best cycling city ' . 
  one of the criteria was ` enough cycle advocacy ' . 
  but guess what . . when your infrastructure , laws and policy is already very good . . you barely need any advocacy . 
  so of course copenhagen came first . 
  all of the above . 
   guys in blackface no . 
  guys looking similar to blackface . 
  pointing out it 's it 's dinner time is a signal to leave . 
  that 's only because we like to compare ourselfs to other western european countries . 
  and compared to english , german , french and spanish , our language is tiny . 
  but then when you learn that we roughly have the same number of speakers as all of the scandinavian languages combined , that 's pretty cool . 
  that is the exact definition . 
  ultra tan and ultra blonde . 
  fashion . 
  every dutch father and son look like they robbed the [ we store ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=we+fashion&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1chhj_nlnl411nl411&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewilnphwv6_vahujafakhfgpdxwq_auicygc&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=808 ) , specifically the floral shirt , shorts and shoe sections . 
  also [ kort & pittig ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1chhj_nlnl411nl411&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=808&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kort+en+pittig&amp;oq=kort+en+pittig&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l4.692548.694388.0.694548.14.11.0.0.0.0.183.1120.1j7.8.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..6.8.1112...0i67k1.lm1ay4poz9a ) is our official national hairstyle . 
  old people are slowly stopping to convert everything to guilders when something 's expensive ( are you insane , that 's * 2500 guilders * !, 
  ) , we 're still convinced we got a bad conversion deal , i still have n't finished my eurocollector . 
  from what i 've heard products were marked using both currencies for a while . 
  and i remember collecting a roll of euro coins at the post office with my mom . 
  i simply imagine that from 1st january 2002 it was euros only . 
  i remember only having 2 years of maths books with guilders in them , which was until 2002/3 so that makes sense . 
  i believe my dad also kept some guilders notes , but he forgot where he kept them . 
  guilder coins are n't exchangable anymore , but you still can exchange notes at the national bank until 1st january 2032 . 
  also we stopped using the 1ct and 2ct coins and round off . 
  all in all it went over pretty smooth i guess . 
  wow . 
  i still say [ goeiemoggel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfystb8aava ) . 
  using `` is '' as a replacement of `` eens '' ( once/a ) using `` hun '' ( their ) instead of `` hen '' ( them ) and then there are the cases where it 's used in a joking way , like mimicking english grammar ( `` je bent welkom '' ) or literally translating words . 
  sometimes called onderhemd to specify ( when it 's used in an underwear-like way ) . 
  overhemd is a regular shirt . 
  he is . 
  it 's not `` widespread '' at all . 
  and certainly not on paris levels . 
  not common here . 
  we either provide or completely ban ( but then usually still provide , just in another place ) . 
  most faraway place from any structure ( buildings and such ) on the mainland ( veluwe ) is is 2 km . 
  praise the lord . 
  a walking tour of diemen . 
  yeah that 's an issue . 
  how are we ever going to bring those up to our standards ? 
  bla bla bla water bla bla bla inventions bla bla bla egalitarian, 
  at night you can buy alcohol in night shops , but those are usually twice as expensive . 
  have n't seen any beer vending machines in ages . 
  nope . 
  sweet neighbours or family members who make a meal after surgery do exists , but it 's by far not the majority . 
  depends on the person and the relationship . 
  fanta light tastes shit . 
  fanta lemon and fanta casis are the bomb . 
  fanta pomelo is alright . 
  * we lost the dutch east-indies with a war of independence . 
  shit got pretty messy , and indonesians still want monetary settlements . 
  the moluccan ( islands ) inhabitants were promised more freedom / [ independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_south_maluku ) if they would help fight against the indonesian seperatists . 
  well , the dutch-indies were lost completely so they were brought to the netherlands . 
  to this day there are still segregated moluccan communities , though they have greatly adapted to dutch society . 
  the [ train jackings ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/treinkaping_bij_de_punt ) , hostages crises and terrorist actions happened , because the moluccans is angry at the dutch government for not keeping their promise . 
  though the situation is calm now , it 's not really resolved . 
  * suriname got its independence in the 60s without bloodshed . 
  the inhabitants were given a choice of staying or leaving to the netherlands . 
  that 's why half of suriname 's population lives here . 
  their current president is a former dicator and is responsible [ december murders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/december_murders ) . 
  he has been convicted here for drug trafficking , and therefore is only welcome in the netherlands to sit out jail time . 
  very common . 
  you used to only be able to get a drivers ' license at 18 . 
  now you can even start taking lessons at 16 . 
  but still many kids buy a scooter at 16 . 
  in the city they 're common too , because scooter users are too lazy to bike and it 's more convenient to park than a car . 
  we have some weird old regulation that makes it that 30 km/h scooters can use the cycle path , which is very convenient in car-calmed cities . 
  but the popularity has risen so much in the last couple of years , and in turn the nuisance of the loud noisy and dangerous ( * always * speeding ) things , that amsterdam is trying to ban them off the cyclepaths , but it 's a legal battle . 
  if they 'd hit the ground we 'd call them ` windhoos ' . 
  a strong windhoos is a called a tornado . 
  when they form over sea ( which happens quite often ) , they 're called waterhoos . 
  a lot of our suburbs and villages are pretty similar . 
  difference is amount/distance to bigger town amenities and facilities . 
  * who burns their bottom must sit on the blisters * met je gat in de brandnetels zitten . 
  * to sit with your [ ass ] hole in the nettles * de donder hangt in de lucht . 
  * the thunder hangs in the sky * er zit stront aan de knikker . 
  * there is shit on the marbles * in de puree zitten . 
  * to sit in the puree * nu heb je de poppen aan het dansen . 
  * now you have the puppets dancing * boontje komt om zijn loontje .
