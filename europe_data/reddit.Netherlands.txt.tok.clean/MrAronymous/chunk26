  i meant low german ( - ish ) . 
  always confuse the two . 
  now i 'm left wondering what do you consider picturesque dutch roads ? 
  i just found out that the berlin accent is hochdeutsch . 
  i am in love . 
  i need to go there now . 
  after all these years i still have no clue . 
  my sister met him at a party once and said he 's for real . 
  next to utrecht centraal sometime later this year . 
  still validates my point . 
  have heard music or loud laughing plenty but never seen any response to it . 
  ( used to travel by train 2 hours a day 3 years straight ), 
  we 're getting that one . 
  we also have 1 taco bell . 
  so i think we 're set here . 
  the entire harry potter series comes on at least once a year . 
  same with the princess diaries or every christmas movie ever . 
  you 'll get a 1 if you 're able to write your name , a 5.5 if you passed and a 10 if you have everything correct . 
  6 is okay-ish , 7 is alright , 8 is good , 9 is great . 
  you 'll also often see decimals like a 6.2 or 7.8 . 
  grade scales depend on the teacher ( not very important test ) , school ( more important test ) or government agency ( very important national test ) . 
  sometimes the teachers make small tests where the highest you can get is an 8 , because a 10 for such a small test would influence other grades too much ( fuck those teachers for potentially getting you a lower average grade tho ) . 
  2 there 's standard classes and in the second part of high school you can choose subjects and drop some . 
  for me i had english , dutch , pe , literature , social studies as standard and chose french , economics , art ( visual ) , history , maths ( a ) . 
  that meant i dropped science , geography , german , chemistry and music and probably some others i ca n't remember . 
  4 i guess we do sort of have it integrated . 
  in my year it was the first time the school decided to teach physics and technics together as `` science '' ( the `` hip '' english word ) . 
  i did also get chemistry seperately in year three though . 
  maths are also integrated . 
  however , they were packaged into differend `` kind '' of maths . 
  so you had maths a , maths b , maths c and maths d . they would include different subtopics that would match to possible future university/of applied sciences education . 
  maths a for example included basic algebra , geometry and some basic statistics but no calculus etc. 
  also there were `` profiles '' you had to choose from before starting the second part of high school . 
  these were basically a pack of subjects to which you can add 2 or 3 optional subjects ; nature and technics , nature and health , culture and society , economics and society . 
  i actually chose to have a double profile by choosing economics and maths in addition to my culture and society profile ( subjects mentioned above ) . 
  they 're both mentioned on my diploma . 
  3 i 'll answer this question after the 4th , because you now might understand the whole deal . 
  so basically there 's diferent kind of maths . 
  they 're very different and some were often described as `` harder '' . 
  but it 's not like you can choose an advanced class of any other subject . 
  that 's because we have [ different levels of high school ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/4lfg1n/tell_me_about_the_dutch_education_system/ ) in general !, 
  5 it 's a thing to fill in the extra hours on the roster and we only had to do it in the first three years or so . 
  i ca n't even remember what i chose . 
  i think that should tell you enough . 
  6 that 's a decision made by the school . 
  i did have homework ( ugh ) . 
  for kids who had trouble with homework or who were trouble in general there was homework class . 
  basically 1 or 2 after school class hours ( 45min each ) with a teacher helping with homework . 
  the goal being that you do n't have any homework after that . 
  yes , twice . 
  [ hollandse waterlinie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hollandic_water_line ) are some pre-wii bunkers . 
  gas water boiler central heating . 
  we have veteran 's day , in which we celebrate both our own as well as foreign wwii veterans . 
  so it 's not a `` look how stronk we are '' but a `` look at these brave people , let 's hope our future countrymen wo n't have to go through the same shit '' . 
  of course walking against a red light is illegal . 
  it is even illegal to cross when there is a marked crossing nearby . 
  will you be fined ? 
  most likely not , unless you cause danger to traffic and a cop is there to ticket you . 
  jaywalking is more than that though . 
  it 's crossing the street anywhere but a marked crossing . 
  now * that * is a stupid rule . 
  especially as there are us cities which design their streets with ridiculously long blocks . 
  but could you handle the corruption and safety issues ? 
  often more flat , sometimes naggy , different sounds based on ' [ ease of pronunciation ] ( https://youtu.be/m3g51xfopie?t=49s ) ' . 
  replacement of the bn series : [ caf urbos 15g ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ctnnqgpwcaaupca.jpg:large ), 
  utrecht still has nightmares about these ones . 
  saw a documentary about it . 
  because so many people left they just razed a few blocks of houses and made it into a park . 
  parkstad region , limburg . 
  with the loss of coal mining many jobs were lost and as a result many people moved away , leaving some villages half empty . 
  that resulted in companies not being profitable anymore and also moving away , a bit of a never ending cycle which resulted in many jobless . 
   though i agree with better care for the elderly i disagree with his plans since it does not provide a solution to a main point : health insurance costs and coverage . 
  so my point is already proven , as you admit to have found a thing you agree with . 
  but then you decide to make it about an other issue ? 
   i believe that our defense and police forces are already strong enough well this just tells me how out of touch with dutch politics you really are . 
  training facilities are [ not up to standard ] ( http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/4842567/materieel-korps-commandotroepen-in-slechte-staat.html ) . 
   to allow for a better attribution of funds and priorities rather than just throw money at it i 'm talking about the netherlands here ...  how ? 
  by lowering taxes ? 
  maybe by making laws regarding social housing . 
  maybe by making it part of the national budget . 
  there 's many options , and no solutions specified yet . 
  that does n't seem to stop you from preemptively disagreeing with it though . 
  who the fuck does n't like lower rents , ` until proven otherwise ' of course , duh . 
   yeah with an easily abusable system that was tried in other countries and ultimately crashed and burned did they say that ? 
  did you just assume that ? 
  yes . 
   a relevant big problem in the netherlands ? 
  do you not see how stupid you sound now . 
  there 's children dying in africa and isis is murdering and raping people , so we might as well stop doing anything here before that 's solved . 
  same logic , same flaw . 
  it 's a sad cop-out . 
  you found something basically * everybody * , including you , agrees with ? 
  oh no , better try to divert the attention to prevent admitting that i was right and that you found a common opinion with a political party you generally disagree with . 
   you can defend what they do such as helping the elderly it 's really not that hard .
