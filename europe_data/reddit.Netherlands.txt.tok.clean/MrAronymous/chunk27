  fact that you 're not willing to admit some stupid political parties might have a good point here or there really makes you look more stupid . 
  i can argue with someone about marihuana legalisation and we can both agree that legalising is a good point , but our opinions can differ on the execution . 
   i do n't think it 's the governments ' job to direct what our infrastructure looks like are you an anarchist or just retarded ? 
  also , i said greenery * and * playgrounds , not in . 
   so if you are won over by their arguments i 'm not , but that 's not what this is all about . 
  it 's simply stating that you ca n't find * annyyything * you agree with . 
  then when i come up with some point you do agree with and then you come up with some sad excuse about technical details or trying to questioning its relevancy ( a really really really poor cop-out ) . 
  just because you dislike someone does n't mean anything they do or propose is bad . 
  your attitude is what creates polar rivalries like [ democrats vs. republicans shitshows ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14ine0/sen_mitch_mcconnell_filibusters_his_own_bill_on/ ) . 
  i do n't like liberalism per se but i agree with social liberties . 
  i dislike the trump administration but i agree with the fact that * illegals * should be treated as * illegal * . 
  i do n't like socialism but i admire their wish to make society better as a whole . 
  i despise theresa may but i agree with her fashion sense . 
  take your pick pvv : - better care for the elderly . 
  more people directly involved with our elderly - more money for police and defense - lower rents denk : - more paid leave to take care of sick children - more effort into relieving child poverty - legal minimum of amount of greenery and playgrounds in neighbourhoods - a journalistic oath must be introduced so that basic journalistic principles are protected you might not agree with all of them , but there 's plenty of points left to choose from . 
  i fucking hate it when people pretend to know all about a political party without even pretending to have read the party programme . 
  borrel nuts, 
  that 's bullshit . 
  you have n't read their party programmes then . 
  99 % of parties have * something * to not dislike . 
  i mean i can even find common ground with jezus leeft !, 
  for god 's sake . 
  well there is car traffic , but most of it outside of city centres . 
  we do have rush hours and traffic jams . 
  they 're always going for people that `` look unique '' . 
  regular pretty is n't unique . 
  technology-wise a net contributor , anything else a liability . 
  yes . 
  the new zealand accent is kind of obscure though , i would mix it up with australian , wheras i can tell apart some other accents from ireland , gb , south-africa , canada , usa . 
  from familiar to less familiar : - grand canyon - niagara falls - hawaii vulcanos - mount rushmore - death valley/desert - monument valley - redwood forest - yellowstone - louisiana swamps - mount st helens, 
  belgium attempting to be relevant fails again . 
  [ did you fall for it ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/k5ur5e61sky?t=6s ), 
  at least 4 . 
  probably going a long way back . 
  tenk - ^ e you - ^ uh, 
  not shout so much and not acting like a dundee . 
  well that just looks ugly on the map . 
  i thought it was pretty great , until i saw [ this ] ( http://unogs.com/countrydetail/ ) lol . 
  personally i have no problems with the content at all , because i like a wide arrange of shows and movies . 
  my list is basically endless so there 's always things to watch and choose from . 
  i have the feeling most people who complain really are title snobs . 
  do note there 's very few domestic shows on netflix as that market is really fragmented and controlled by the companies themselves . 
  making/buying oliebollen/appelbeignets/other food , watching comedians review the year on tv , have parties , light fireworks , light big bonfires , light carbid in milk churns , take a new year 's dive in the sea , have new years gatherings at work . 
  so what 's the equivalent of negroe/n \u00e8gre in italian ? 
  it would be disasterous when it comes to representation . 
  the grass is always greener . 
  in this case though , the statistics are a bit greener on many issues as wel . 
  i still find it hard to believe he 's fo real . 
  wouter hamel in korea and rudolf van veen in ~ ~ eastern ~ ~ central europe . 
  yet you should n't spread half-truths . 
  more like shnegroe-tits . 
  is negretti/negro really * nigger * and not negro , though ? 
   jodenkoeken the origin of this name is unclear though . 
  it most likely does n't even have to do anything with jews . 
  nope . 
  only the attic rooms ( rooms were put in later ) and the interior garage access door . 
  i mean how cute is [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/amsterdam/comments/6meu2q/touristsvisitorsnew_residents_qa_thread_for_the/dk423e0/ ) . 
  they could also have named them after the people who they got it from , which were belgians , but spoke french . 
  better start thinking of a good [ comeback ] ( https://youtu.be/jpjlpawbqga?t=1m50s ) boyyo . 
  dutch people are [ notorious ] ( https://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2010/11/24/no-8-not-owning-curtains/ ) for not closing their curtains in the evening . 
  in my house they mostly get used to keep the sun out . 
  i do n't mind people seeing into my house and honestly ca n't be bothered to open and close them every 2 times a day 365 days a year . 
  plus i just like to know what 's happening outside and i enjoy a bright house . 
  lace curtains that used to be very popular are nowadays seen as something for old people . 
  not really full fledges homes , but there 's holiday home parks . 
  many people also spend time on their garden allotments , boats or go to the camping . 
  denmark and the netherlands have the same level of cycling infrastructure . 
  i 'm genetically programmed to be wary of people who defy logic . 
  they 're there , but not as popular as they are in belgium by far . 
  yes . 
  `` i do n't watch tv '' is a very common phrase . 
  lack of closed curtains . 
  coco pops with milk . 
  too much . 
  political pressure , economic pressure , abandonment . 
  hand in your passport . 
  it all makes sense now . 
  under 10 %, 
  that might only be true in seaside or border towns where they expect german tourists . 
  english would be friendlier , since we sort of expect everybody in europe to know it as it 's the current day lingua franca . 
  but if you want to be considerate you can just ask ` sprechen sie deutsch ? ', 
  first . 
  if they give you a weird look , continue in english . 
  if the weird look remains do the sign language improv thing . 
  we pull out the subtitles . 
  nah but the walloons are often ignored , as the border we share is pretty small . 
  on the german side the local regional languages [ overlap historically ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/deutsche_dialekte_1910.png ) , so there was no border to speak of . 
  the non-regional standard language speakers usually also know how to speak german there . 
  and otherwise english . 
  if i have to go by television , movies and reddit , american schools really are more prison-like . 
  it starts by being picked up by the prison bus ( okay joking ) , not trusting your kids and therefore needing a hall pass , the existence of hall monitors , schools having a security or police officer ( !, 
  ) , constant and loose threats of detention , kids being constatly sent to the principal 's office ( do n't they have actual stuff to do ) , lackluster lunches which you have to pay for seperately , the uncanny similarity in terms of architecture , ( racial ? ), 
  cliques and the worst of all , the zero tolerance policy ( what a great way to teach justice and fairness to children ) . 
  many of these are somewhat present in the schools i went to but not to these extremes . 
  i think most people start picking out their outfits around 4-5-6 years of age . 
  keukenhof is only open from march til may . 
  botanical gardens should be open year round . 
  there 's [ this ] ( http://tulipsinholland.com/calendar/ ) i guess , but not really a calender like you speak of . 
  there are gardens all over europe .
