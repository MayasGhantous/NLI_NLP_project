  our old city centers are n't very wheelchair friendly and our national train system is n't fully level-floor yet , but it 's doable . 
  on the other hand we do have bike infrastructure that can be used by the disabled . 
  why even bother asking questions of which you already know the answers of . 
  how do i reach deez kids . 
  but the hotel prices will rise , become unafforable for many and airb & b will flourish . 
  well many apearantly are n't , as they 're talking about how erdo is making turkey great again and how shit our country is . 
  they `` will move to turkey in the future '' . 
  sure , any day now ... 
  the government is going to sell though . 
  huh ? 
  but i 'd have to speak with a belgian accent !, 
  counting is always the most intuitive in your native language . 
  but i can count in other languages too . 
  except french cause that shit is confusing . 
  all the damn time maine, 
  basically all our newer cities are planned cities . 
  [ here 's a list ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/vinex ) of the specific `` vinex '' type . 
  he looks very likeable . 
  brenninkmeijer ( c&a ) , heineken ( heineken ) , goldschmeding ( randstad ) , de mol/van den ende ( endemol , television and theater productions ) , de rijcke ( kruidvat drugstore ) , van der vorm ( vorm real estate development ) , dreesmann ( former department store v&d ) , van oord ( jumbo supermarkets ) , pon ( vw car importer ), 
  it was [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv0ma6hfgsw ) from yesterday . 
  our selection of news is pretty broad . 
  there 's plenty of days where most of the news is foreign . 
  foreign reporters will make interesting little segments about life-changing new laws or topics that would n't get coverage in other countries ( us drug epidemic , millions of people in moscow being forced to move , ` regime change ' in hong kong , etc. ), 
   mofrika [ reminds me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6k5l-wjnsq ), 
  what say you . 
  somehow when browsing stores i always leave with something from distrikt n\u00f8rrebro and bershka . 
  just say `` ugh , hate the guy . 
  can we please not talk about him '' . 
  done . 
  sperrys would only be worn by * kakkers * or 50 + year olds . 
  supergas look like you would buy them for $ 5 at primark . 
  can anyone do a quick eli5 on kosovo ? 
  everything works so well in germany . 
  oh those handsome swedes . 
  at least the french/italians/spanish / greek know how to enjoy life . 
  are n't belgians adorable . 
  cool name . 
  deen - dane duits - german ( ic ) engels - english frans - french italiaander - italianer polak - polack pruis - prussian schot - scot * schotman - scotsman spanjaard - spaniard turk - turk de vries - the frisian vlaanderen - flanders de waal - the walloon * wallis - wales ( van ) zweden - ( of ) sweden zwitser ( s ) - swiss * might also mean something else i 'm sure there 's plenty more . 
  is n't it just \u00f1 ? 
  im just assuming it 's pronounced r\u00f8 \u00f8rre, 
  as for the loanwords people tend to think cover is pronounced * k\u00f6ffer * , jus d'orange becomes * sj\u00fcderansj * and touch becomes * t\u00f6tsj * . 
  i found it impossible to pronounce the i in * nina * . 
  it 's somewhere in the back of the mouth, 
  that would definitely be the local accent . 
  they tend to lenghten the e-sound at the end as well so it would sound more like enskedee . 
  these names are all pronounced the same : cuyper kuijper kuiper, 
  at least on reddit they do . 
  quite often even . 
  but nether means low , not far ? 
  just to tag along ; please people , do n't call amsterdam `` the dam '' or even worse , `` dam '' . 
  there are a bajillion places here that end with the - dam suffix . 
  people wo n't know what you mean . 
  not even mentioning the fact that the central city square is called . . dam . 
  which in dutch we like to call ` de dam ' ( the dam ) . 
  if you want to be hip use damsko , a'dam or mokum . 
  yes . 
   vla #  puts up picture of pie fucking southener . 
  #p a t a t, 
  increasing of the ` fuck you got mine ' attitude and prevelance of the english language . 
   blockbuster even stopped existing videoland is still around !, 
  new kids . 
  my sister went to sailing camp and i went to a summer camp . 
  it was n't in a forrest or anything , they used the local football club grounds . 
  they had loads of activities set up so you 'd never get bored , it even included trips to theme parks . 
  we got picked up by our parents at the end of each day though . 
  half our town consists of indian ~ ~ expats ~ ~ migrant workers , so we 've gotten a few more . 
  i 'm not very impressed though . 
  sounds like a cheap ass wedding then . 
  they do n't really like our influence but they do want our money . 
  we like our influence but do n't like spending so much money . 
  ent den wie woet spiek djerman laik deej wantet in de first plees . 
  you 'll get used to it really quickly . 
  slippery slope . 
  meh , the upvotes in this subreddit are weird in general . 
  interesting questions with lots of answers usually aren ; t even upvoted that much . 
  how are nieuw-oost-indi\u00eb and v.o.c. 
  equal to `` netherlands '' ? 
  only offering 200ml for full price should be outlawed ffs, 
  about europaplein , amsterdam :  on 16 july 1958 the square got renamed after the continent of europe , after the resolution of the advisory assembly of the council of europe in 1957 , where every municipality in europe got asked to name a street or square after this event . 
  free refills please . 
  amsterdam has the ` amsterdam bridge ' , which only happened because of annexation . 
  naming things after yourself is generally seen as tacky and against the naming convention . 
  usually when streets are named after countries it 's because that 's the naming theme of the entire neighbourhood . 
  all the pvv facebook pages . 
  de telegraaf is our ` worst ' ( and most sold ) newspaper , but is squeeky clean and well-behaved compared to the british rags . 
  this is so weird it looks soviet . 
  that 's a real difference between americans and europeans : americans often actually wear clothing with things on it that are familiar to them ( tourism , school , event , local pride ) wheras europeans buy those because the regular stores have branded it as fashion . 
  most people here do n't know that it 's * a thing * at all . 
  like [ this varsity jacket ] ( http://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/me5_ngdc1ozzk5ylm5uhvmq.jpg ) from h&m . people know it 's american ( because seen it in the movies ) , but will have no relation to it at all . 
  in the stores you will see all kinds of random shirts ( in a way it 's like chinese tattoos lol ) with `` university of ... '' or `` random us town + date '' simply as decoration . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.c-and-a.com/nl/nl/shop/jongens/maat-122-182/shirts/alle-shirts/page-3/duopack-biokatoenshirts-met-korte-mouwen-192003-1.html ) is all made up . 
  well talking about the accent here , not dialect . 
  flemish is not in my top 3 . 
  twents is a guilty pleasure . 
  germany , uk , france , spain , italy , usa . 
  i think in my country we would call that an infraction . 
  named after the city of infract . 
  pronunciation is hard though . 
  english speakers are born with a limited sounds deficiency . 
  even meter readers are announced beforehand nowadays here because of scams .
