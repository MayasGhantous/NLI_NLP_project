  some had smells on them and such . 
  when that caught on even the boys participated in the diddl economy . 
  do n't even know if this was a national thing or local only . 
  a year before that [ these things ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=diddle&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1chhj_nlnl411nl411&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi7wumyg7luahulzlakhr3ychmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=808#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=scooby+doo+touwtjes+rage ) were all the rage even up to the point the teachers would join in .
