  your forgot [ arnhem ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/breng_5243%2c_arnhem_station.jpg ) !, 
  it was even mentioned in the previous bus post . 
  eh , it 's meant for the average cyclist in copenhagen . 
  which is not one who 's on a racing bike with spandex . 
  it 's 35 year old moms with groceries and kids on the bike . 
  or a student who 's just going to uni , but does n't want to go too fast and unneccesarily sweat . 
  what do you mean . 
  meh , most amsterdam gvb busses have already been replaced by vdl citea buses .

  well that since he was talking about belgian motorway illumination ( aka every bit of road illuminated ) , and we in the netherlands are n't as actively turning off the lights ( + we 'd remove them too ) as the belgians are , it seemed as if you were speaking as a belgian but with a dutch flag . 
  your flair is dutch . 
  in recent years it 's become a big deal . 
  part has to do with the perception foreigners have of it and them misunderstanding imo . 
  small children are allowed to do both on the sidewalk . 
  older people are expected to use the cycle path when going fast on rollerblades/skateboard . 
  if you 're in a quiet suburb though , it usually does n't even matter . 
  hmmmmaybe . 
  you have to admit though , belgians are one of the more socially awkward/introvert peoples of europe . 
  exactly . 
  imagine how bad it must be here then when these people do that . 
  * inb4 do n't walk on the bike paths . 
  really though , do n't . 
  * do n't talk louder than the people around you , aka shout , when it 's not neccessary . 
  ( looking at you italians , americans and brazilians ) * do n't assume everybody likes weed and frequents a hooker every week . 
  ( first question i often get asked is `` do you smoke a lot ? '' . 
  like . . really ? 
  come on . ), 
  * do n't talk about zwarte piet . 
   what makes you think there arent rude drivers in dacias ? 
  did n't ever say that . 
  i 'd rather have a cheapo dacia with good service and a good price than a stupid overpriced amsterdam mercedes taxi with a rude driver . 
  have you been reading the news at all ? 
  hundreds civilians have died the past few days . 
  if they 're casulties of specifically enemy-aimed bombings or not that does n't matter . 
  civilians are civilians . 
  the somewhat sensationalistic rtl nieuws gets a total hard-on . 
  but this is a news program that likes to pretend non-news is news . 
  the tv channel even goes as far as repeating the same ( non - ) news story in the ` general informative newsy fun show ' as well as their ` tmz-eque celebrity newa show ' which are broadcasted between two news broadcasts . 
  also they somehow like to report everything obama does , eventhough he 's not our president , mentioning that he 's `` the most powerful man in the world '' in * every * news item about him . 
  http://youtu.be/piu3fix6coc?t=11m37s `` bonsoir copenhague , ... bonsoir copenhague we have styled our mustaches tonight and we wish to congratulate all the artist who are there to defend the colours of their country . 
  also thanks to the backstage crew ; the writers , the composers , the musicians . 
  thank * you * , copenhagen , for the really incredible show . 
  and further we would like to say that we in france are proud to be part of this * jio * ( ? ), 
  of music . 
  here are the french votes . 
  no nevermind what i said . 
  i really do n't remember . 
  i 'll look it up for you on pc later . 
  i do n't remember . 
   he 's only 61 holy shit !, 
  dude looks good, 
  but its n't wei\u00df alternatively weiss ? 
  and does n't that become weiss ? 
  ` eszett ' makes a lot more sense now . 
  but why not heisst ? 
  because british people never say yeah ? 
  ever ? 
  yeah but i know proper grammar . . or so i thought . 
  black vernacular ?!, 
  but i 'm a whitie from the netherlands !, 
  at least they got that one right . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics 2 . 
  american ( standard ) 3 . 
  canadian our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  dutch 2 . 
  english 3 .

  holy shit . 
  rename the fucking bridge asap pls . 
  he was very well covered in my history class !, 
  funny story : apparantly when he was still fresh from france he wanted to introduce himself to the dutch people . 
  so when he was out on his balcony in amsterdam he tried to say in dutch `` ik ben uw koning '' ( i am your king ) . 
  but instead , because of his thick french accent he said `` ik ben uw konijn '' ( i am your rabbit ) . 
  love the guy . 
  they also started an investigation against starbucks ' intl headquarters and the tax deals with the netherlands . 
  not putingrad ? 
  are n't there fb and google headquarters and server centers in the eu ( mainly ireland ) ? 
  and surely google has local headquarters . . so they should be able to do something right ? 
   and why is a 6 lane highway ( between amsterdam and utrecht ) limited to 100 km/h . 
  made absolutely no sense . 
  the a2 basically used to be jammed every morning and evening , cause it only had 3x3 ( right ? ), 
  so it was clear it * had * to be widened , after nothing being done to that road since at least the '90s . 
  so the government made a deal with the surrounding municipalities that protested ; wide but slow . 
  then when it was done people complained about the 100km/h limit and the * trajectcontrole * ( license plate gets read and average speed between two points gets measured ) , and it turns out some residents living near it do n't even mind if the limit would get raised , but some municipalities do , and there 's contacts and natura2000 blabla . 
  we have the ` french r ' ( back in the throat ) ` spanish r ' [ but less violently ] ( front of the mouth ) and ` english r ' ( floating mid-mouth ) . 
  it depends on your accent on which one ( s ) you use , and most of the time you can use them inchargebly . 
  just do n't use the ` english r ' in the first syllable and you 're good to go . 
  [ explanation . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiwmtglquzy ), 
  thank god you added that french line or you would have made me feel * moin europ\u00e9en * . 
  * you got shit food ? 
  you evolved from the british ? 
  * your media is a bit over the top crazy ? 
  ( i mean some of the stuff that 's on tv over there ? 
  just wow ) . 
  idk . 
  traitor !, 
  i do n't think anywone whould have complained if she said `` bonsoir , merci pour le show magnifique . 
  voici les votes francaises . . '' and then give the final points .
