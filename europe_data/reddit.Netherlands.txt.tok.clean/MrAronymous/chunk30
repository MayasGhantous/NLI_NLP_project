  who knew some people considered belgium a country !, 
  luvsit . 
  sun , sex and suspicious parents , location , location , location , airline , bizarre er , blind date , little britain , road wars , dragon 's den , grand designs , anything gordon ramsay or other cooks , four in a bed , ex on the beach , geordie shore , etc. 
  oh mijn god and oh my god are both used . 
  the latter mostly by young girls . 
  npo airs the scandinavian crime series as well and often has foreign films . 
  rtl and sbs often air cheap british tv shows like jamie oliver , supernanny , embarrassing bodies , 60 minute makeover , etc. 
  and documentaries ( rtl z ), 
  ready for pringles . 
  hey bby . 
  do n't deny it . 
  i 'd say trouw . 
  yes , since you wo n't get one free . 
  unless i 'm buying takeaway food and if i just bought 4 small items i 'll just carry them by hand because i wo n't have to go far . 
  if i knew beforehand , i 'd have taken bags with me . 
  it depends on the country 's globalist or isolationist outview . 
  if nobody would watch anything in a foreign language , no point in providing those tv channels . 
  it 's not like millions of people watch german tv here but we like to have to option to . 
  i can at least watch 4 different eurovision or olympics commentaries . 
  because your country is foreign-shy ? 
  in basic analogue tv packages ( if they still even exist ) i could get das erste , zdf , wrd , \u00e9\u00e9n , canvas , bbc 1 , bbc 2 , tv5monde , tve , rai 1, 
  [ sounds alright ] ( https://youtu.be/tjik9t4jmio?t=28s ) [ to me ?

  the frisian version has wikipedy ( they also call it ynternet ) and low saxon wikipedie . 
  um , not really . 
  we 've reached the next step here in nl . 
  in updated restaurants when you go to the regular cashier , you get a ticket when ordering . . then your order gets put in the same waiting line . 
  it 's a tie between venice , valetta and monte carlo ( 2 times ) . 
  i rarely return to places . 
  for the love of god just say gowda ( en ) or gauda ( de ) . 
  it 's a muggy swamp after all . 
  there 's mercedes-benz grabage trucks and city buses . 
  where did you get this american idea of merc = luxury only from . 
  with one of the arguments being that `` a mercedes looks more imposing '' and it should help their image . 
  meanwhile they probably did n't realise that [ this ] ( https://images.abcdn.nl/image/a978473aaf_politie-test-al-met-mini-countryman.jpg?mark=%2fimage%2fwatermark%2fautobahn-watermark-def.png&amp;markalign=top%2cright&amp;markpad=12&amp;markscale=10&amp;rect=240%2c204%2c1322%2c744&amp;w=880&amp;s=e62cafb8abd3e87f8ad3507d86b5a184 ) would look cooler * and * support the tiny amount of dutch car manufacturing we have going on . 
  i 'm not sure the coolness argument even works for the b-class and vito . 
  americans love turkey . 
  especially in november !, 
  wow so your constitution grants you rights to bear cards too now ? 
  awesum . 
  - lee jeans for $ 15 - waiters pretending to be our friend - we had to get into the car to be able to cross the road - the the pool cage kind of seemed ridiculous at first but it turned out to be pretty nice . 
  - i forgot my shoes when they were drying outside when we left . 
  i loved those shoes . 
  - sudden rain so crazy we had to stop on the side of the highway . 
  - my parents did n't believe me when i told them they could go right on red . 
  - when you 're on highway 1 it 's . . just a road . 
  still , wearing my tacky touristy mile 0 shirt as we speak . 
  + the party for animals who do n't mind their outsider role as long as it influences policies or views of other parties the socialist sp brand themselves as ` the opposition party ' . 
  morgen/ochtend ~ 3-12 middag 12/12  avond 18  nacht 24 - ~ 3 voormiddag ( 10-12 ) and namiddag ( 15-18 ) are n't really used that much , if at all . 
  functional government , having an actual navy , urban planning , landscape , patat vs. frieten , flemish are socially awkward & dutch are outgoing ( belgium is a well-mannered catholic school boy and the netherlands is his annoying teenage sister with great tits ) , infrastructure is generally better maintained here ( lets 's not even start with the bike paths ) , belgians call anal seks poepen while that means pooping in the netherlands . 
  need more ? 
  yours suck ours has tits . 
  and we put miniature ones in cheese and herring because pride . 
  there frenchified it for you, 
  it 's fabulous . 
  so dutch that nobody there speaks dutch . 
  they have outdutched themselves . 
  well maybe it 's because the people are represented more fairly in the national government then ? 
  ( the uk vote/seat ratio is weird as hell + ` two party system ' ) or maybe because those two countries are n't as capital centric ? 
  because regions have a large amount of atonomy . 
  same here . 
  5,5 is passed . 
  sometimes a formula is used where results will end up in double digits right of the decimal comma . 
  often rounded off to one digit right of the comma if it 's not an important test . 
  there 's [ nederland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nederland,_overijssel ) in overijssel . 
  every day ? 
  y' all is crazy . 
  carpet in the bathroom however , does n't seem to be a problem . . 
  yunan sounds like it 's something dirty . 
  big part of the controversy was that he said ` then we 'll take care of it ' after the crowd cheered . 
  later he said he thought it was obvious from the context that it meant less * criminal * moroccans , which would obviously be less controversial . 
  who would n't like less criminals ? 
  also as a general rule drop the h sound . 
  many people understand the reason for it but do n't find it comfortable ( mostly those from the area that 's not holland ) . 
  many people also do n't really care . 
  there 's no concensus . 
  hate kensington 's name but their songs are * the best * for car rides . 
  drumming on the steering wheel and singing along and all that . 
  [ this channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucib2fkhwkigtabnuj6d7oew ) has much ` hip ' dutch stuff . 
  jan jansen ( john johnson ) jan modaal ( john average ) henk & ingrid ( lower class regular folk ), 
  loved going to neptune in the weekend as a kid . 
  well we were stingy businessmen that used ( classic ) liberalism so we could profit more . 
  i have more trust in the police force than i have in the ministry that 's leading it . 
  gay looking swedish men tho . 
  own it . 
  north holland best holland . 
  weirdly noorwegen sounds like it could be plural in dutch . 
  noordman is reserved for the pine trees and acient norwegian tribes . 
  when i was learning french in france my teacher would correct me and pronounce it `` n\u00e9-irlandais '' instead of simply `` n\u00e9\u00e9rlandais '' , not realising that ` neerland ' is dutch as well and means the same as nederland . 
  fun fact , spanjaard is a slur . 
  ^ and ^ now ^ the ^ official ^ demonym, 
  not very . 
  i mean calling it holland is one thing . 
  but not knowing it 's not the official name of the country is another . 
  do * not * call our country holland in official settings or you will look uneducated and unprofessional . 
  furthermore , our plural name looks messy and gets treated weirdly . 
  in lists you will often see the name with the ` the ' included or ` the ' capitalised . 
  yet nobody would do that when talking about * the * united states or * the * united kingdom . 
  combined with the fact that the english call our language * dutch * , while we and the germans use a variation of that word for german . . can be confusing too . 
  all of this could have been avoided if other countries bothered to pay attention to our history and follow our example .
