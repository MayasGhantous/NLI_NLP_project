  after belgium split off and * the netherlands * were basically done with , we started calling ourselves nederland , aka netherland . 
  we also speak nederlands , aka netherlandish . 
  so much more straight forward . 
  yeah i never understood that weird split between the regular noodles and rice and stuff that goes with it and the ` oriental ' section which has even more things that go with it . 
  but then again the american peanut butter is stocked with the peanut butters and the marmite is located next to the jelly spreads and honey . 
  i would say most items are stocked according to food group . 
  i do n't think we have international food isles . 
  i mean yeah all the pasta stuff is grouped together and so are the east asian/noodle/rice type of foods . 
  that 's where is where you will find the indonesian stuff . 
  amsterdam is full of obnoxious spanish , german , italian and french young people . 
  france also has the strictest laws regarding marihuana , go figure . 
  it 's almost as if just making legislation does n't work . 
  * weird !, 
  swiss people have no soul . 
  dutch | english : -- | : -- koest ! | * calm/quiet !, 
  * zo is ` ie braaf | * so he 's good * now there 's a good boy braaf | well-behaved zit ! | * sit !, 
  * lig ! | * lay down !, 
  * stoute hond ! | * naughty dog !, 
  * bad dog af ! | * off !, 
  * stay off/get off kom hier ! / kom maar | * come here ! / com ` ere boy * fun fact : many [ american police dogs ] ( http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/breaking-news/index.ssf/2013/02/speaking_their_language_police.html ) use dutch or german commands . 
  bike + tram . 
  we have 2 main news programmes . 
  nos journaal is the government-funded programme that tries to be neutral and hip but often fails . 
  rtl nieuws is on a commercial channel and neutral as well but sometimes a bit on the sensationalist side . 
  they both mix serious and less important local news both national and international . 
  difference is in priority given to an item and tone . 
  both * always * finish off with a light hearted/happier `` news '' item . 
  both of them have 10 minute editions every hour or so with at 20:00 the main news of 20 min . 
  for more in-depth news there 's other programmes like buitenhof and nieuwsuur . 
  and for even less in-depth news there 's 1 vandaag , editienl , hart van nederland which cater to the dog mayors , children who collect money for a good cause and silly underbelly outrage . 
  all soaps do is connect grease/dirt and water . 
  if you use force ( brush , hands ) and water you can get most stuff off easily . 
  you would n't use an antibacterial soap if you 're not highly paranoid . 
  to be fair that used to be very common . 
  that 's why [ dish racks ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/druiprek.jpg ) and these [ grooves ] ( http://www.nasimo.be/uploads/pics/keukenblad_in_graniet_met_groeven._spoelbak_in_onderbouw.jpg ) in the kitchen counter exist . 
  it 's less common nowadays though , many people own dishwashers and of those who do n't , most people do dry the dishes and then store them directly afterwards . 
  priorities aye . 
  i 'm gon na say massachussets . 
  reasonably flat and watery , pretty densely built-up , small , bricks , down-to-earth , blunt people , ranks high in all the good lists . 
  tilburg has a trashy reputation as well i believe . 
  idk . 
  even * we * do it when mimicking/mocking you . 
  sure . 
  quiet , peaceful , flat , close to big cities . 
  butttt the honecker regime actually stopped the singing of the lyrics when they went against what the song preached , so in theory they could have adopted it just to spite him . 
  and the brits stole it [ from the french ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8faeqffakra ) , 
   prins pinsler what now, 
  only for eurovision . 
  it 's in the basic tv packages here . 
  pretty pointless considering about a third of them end in divorce . 
  the fact that it 's allowed or the fact that there are people that are willing to go public with those views ? 
  we have some executive agencies that are decentralised and some national agencies that are divided into a couple regions and have multiple offices and no main office . 
  how so ? 
  linksmensch ( notice the german sch ) , gutmensch ( sjw ) , linkse elite ( left-wing elite ) , theedrinkers ( tea drinkers , social democrats/lefties ) , pvv ` ers , fascisten , henk & ingrid ( average joes , negative connotation ) . 
  many of these started out as sarcastic but became fairly regularly used phrases . 
  ( like t_d would use ` cuck ' ), 
  compared to other cities prices are decent . 
  but compared to 10 years ago it 's crazy . 
  people are bidding on houses without having been over for a viewing . 
  people are selling with a 200.000 profit . 
  even painting the window sills a very different colour is considered radical here . 
  more like intrusive window ? 
  snelheidsbegrenzer = cruise control sociale media = social media verkenner = explorer ( internet ) there 's even an [ organisation ] ( http://bondtegenleenwoorden.nl/a.html ) against all loan words ( going back to middle dutch ), 
  fuck those sexy danes . 
  marry our cousin belgium . 
  kill the turkey . 
  not anymore . 
  den helder is improving the main street immensely . 
  and even then , not the ugliest at all , especially not by international standards . 
  size , landscape , egalitarian , bikes , handsome , politics in the middle , pragmatic , smart , throat disease, 
  only if you make it so . 
  you did n't stop driving volkswagen or wearing hugo boss because of wwii did you ? 
  the fact that some racists here and there use it does n't mean it 's theirs now . 
  political apathy , polarization , lack of nuance and ` common good ', 
  i just puked a little . 
  i do feel some sort of special connection to the flemish though , but that 's kind of expected considering our history and cultural proximity . 
  maybe red to orange . 
  why ? 
  because the republic kicked ass that 's why . 
  and all those countries copy-catting our tri colours has made it stand out less . 
  `` we need more housing !, 
  severe housing shortage ! '', 
  `` you want to build a 6 story building here in the city ? 
  totally monstrous . 
  this is no manhattan you know . '', 
  `` it 's nye-key , like the god . 
  duh '' ok you mean * n\u00edki * ? 
  alright then . 
  or coupe . . when they mean coup\u00e9 . 
  [ do you though ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l5xx0v7rti ), 
  quite a bit . 
  then again i sometimes see how unnuanced they are about topics that i know a bit more about . 
  still years ahead of american tv news channels . 
  those should be called straight up propoganda . 
  even local tv is biased to the max . 
  nope . 
  just ` bote ' with an o like hope . 
  boat with a consistent o sound and no a, 
  setting somebody on fire prank [ goes wrong !, 
   historically `` correct '' pronunciation if you 're going to use that as an argument you might as well cancel that whole failed language experiment called english altogether .
