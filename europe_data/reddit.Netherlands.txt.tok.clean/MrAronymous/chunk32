  so what do you call it then ? 
  pizza al salami ? 
  i 'm not english though . 
  `` they 're freedom fighters fighting for their own country ! '', 
  yeah so is that that two-lettered group in the vicinity . . 
  \u00fcber u from d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu + be ^ h over did i win ? 
  that 's actually what we call a `` soft g '' and the way they would pronounce it in the southern part of the netherlands and flanders . 
  but do n't you know parmesan is french ? 
  i 'll start calling it medrod and barceleno from now on . 
  goddamn i still ca n't get over the fact to how similar norwegian is sometimes . 
  typical frenchie name yknow . 
  [ especially since . . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dam_square ), 
  it 's obdam . 
  no churches in my new suburb . 
  but if standing outside you can hear the small town [ church ] ( http://vanhellenberghubar.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-22-urbanuskerk-nes-aan-de-amstel.jpg ) bells ringing far away . 
  they only ring their bells at christmas , easter , weddings and funerals though . 
  because the waiter did n't speak dutch , not because it 's in vogue . 
  it 's an unfortunate result of the mass tourism amsterdam is succumbing under and the ` dutch is unimportant and stupid anyway ' attitude that is very common . 
  especially in the 50s and 60s women were to dress presentable . 
  they 'd go to salons to get their hair done and often get a perm . 
  so if your hair was looking al little less fabulous [ a headscarf ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4e/33/78/4e3378193d9c14f56c8e30e98cd3dbf4.jpg ) was a great solution . 
  they were used to [ shield them from the rain ] ( http://images-mds.staticskynet.be/newsfolder/h-450_s-1/regenkapje-blancheporte-fr_20140827101748.jpg ) as well . 
  flappen - ` flaps ' , meaning bank notes duiten - named for old voc-era guilder coin duppie - name for ` dubbeltje ' , ` double one ' aka 0.10 guilders piek - named for old 1 guilder coin which used to have virgin with a sword ( ` peak ' ) on it ** from [ bargoens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bargoens ) : ** poen knaken - named for rijksdaalder , an old guilder coin heitje - named for 25ct guilder coin - yiddish heitebas meaning 5x5cts meier - 100 guilders - from jewish mei'oh meaning hundred joetje - 10 guilers - from hebrew yod meaning 10 geeltje - ` yellow one ' - used for yellow money ** ` modern street language ' : ** doekoe - surinamese for ` money ' doni - surinamese for ' 5 bank note ' barki - surinamese for ' 100 bank note ' ekkies - euros egger bread - english ` bread ' ca cheez - from english ` cheese ' do ( doh ) - from english ` dough ' floes franco - probably from french ` franc ' lakoenza scrilla, 
  argh i 'm so jealous of your vibrant bunad culture . 
  gooi and hagenaar accents are posh . 
  amsterdam , rotterdam , utrecht and hagenees accents are lower-class . 
  overijssel and drenthe are silly farmers friesland and groningen are stubborn farmers brabantian is not to be taken seriously limburgish is not to be taken seriously at all surinamese and antillian is sloppy i guess about each of [ these areas ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/qyzbr8r ) has a specific accent . 
  [ frikandel ] ( https://www.vangeloven.com/sites/default/files/styles/header/public/uitsnede_14a9351_0.jpg?itok=1loeisr - ) . 
  this is the [ dream ] ( https://images2.persgroep.net/rcs/5ux6o3ttsuvi9gxoyn4svzl7dtc/diocontent/76615153/_fill/1200/900/?appid=21791a8992982cd8da851550a453bd7f&amp;quality=0.9 ) . 
  febo has already been mentioned . 
  other regulars which usually come in a stall/cart : [ fish ] ( http://112eelde.nl/wp-content/uploads/010-kopie88.jpg ) , [ vietnamese ] ( https://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/no-slug/3bcfac04edd04d205b43aa9f4c44ab5d.jpg ) , your occasional [ surinamese ] ( http://www.surinaamsesnackssitara.nl/images/kraam.jpg ) , [ pastries ] ( http://www.verbruggenderaden.nl/images/fotoalbum/data/images/gebakkraam_verbruggen_de_raden.jpg ) which turn into [ oliebollen ] ( https://bertspiertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/oliebollenkraam_mgl9886.jpg ) stands come december . 
  there are other stands ( fresh [ stroopwafels ] ( https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8194/8135689599_25a0a4049c_b.jpg ) , [ poffertjes ] ( http://www.draaivermaak.nl/typo3temp/pics/478fb7bcb1.jpg ) , etc. ), 
  but they only go to regular markets or events . 
  i think it 's sad that many people do n't know [ where it originated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_india_company ) , especially since you like to put it on every non-breathable thing . 
  look good though , but that 's because i 've become used to seeing it . 
  yeah to add to this , the concept of `` friends '' is different here . 
  it 's related to how close you consider you and someone to be . 
  and that has to be really close . 
  you could know somebody for years , but they could still be an acquaintance . 
  you could meet some people and hang out all night and they would barely be considered immediate friends . 
  you could meet somebody at the beginning of your holiday and spend an entire week together and it would still be possible to not be considered each others friends . 
  or [ watch this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbu-emcef3s ) if you do n't want/can read a book . 
  most people are not-pro-religion . 
  sometimes there 's thoughtful discussions . 
  downvotes do n't really happen though . 
  [ god i loved these .

  like americans with extra cool . 
  bad quality shampoo ? 
  wow . 
  not the right sounding kind of throar cancer . 
  ^ love ^ your ^ kaiserschmarrn ^ tho, 
  chips : garlic sauce fries : mayo , ketchup , satay sauce, 
  it 's on the adriatic and has a fancy name . 
  that 's about it . 
   it was the company itself that changed the name as a publicity stunt . 
  everybody still calls them negerzoenen . 
  they something to identify with . 
  poor sods . 
  sorry , you 're not invited to the throat cancer club . 
  you 're avoiding his point . 
  nope , definitely still easy . 
  just look out for the devoiced letters and lack of stretched out vowels . 
  i think ` neutral ' swiss german pronounciation somehow sounds very dutch . 
  so do about [ 4 other dialects ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmrhmbfaqy ) . 
  they really should become more popular . 
  the whole weed culture is very american though . 
  420 , blaze it , trees , grass , etc. 
  the fact that amsterdam 's full of fucking nutella waffle shops nowadays sure is n't helping . 
  wait so what do you do when you want to write a sentence in latin with a capital followed by a sentence in greek starting with a captial ? 
  is there a ` greek lock ' somewhere ? 
  important to mention that there 's a strict language seperation in belgium because o language laws . 
  in flanders you 'll follow the signs towards luik and when you cross the wallonian border luik will be replaced by li\u00e8ge . 
  if they would sign all names in the other language too , the signs would get * even more * ( love you ) cluttered . 
  in brussels everything should be bi - ( or sometimes even tri - ) lingual . 
  funny thing is that foreign place names often * do * get both languages on there , e.g. 
  signs in wallonia pointing towards names in the german speaking area are often signed dually ( german speaking area is part of the french-speaking wallonia region , but not of the french language community ) . 
  [ dutch cornflakes ~ ~ isle ~ ~ * shelves * ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e8/e6/96/e8e696ea8622c3a14cdf846e0c548453.jpg ) in an a small to medium sized store . 
  to the right of the image you 'll find a bunch of mueslis and wheats/grains . 
  * noun 1 . an excise tax based on the value added to a product at each stage of production or distribution : value added is arrived at by subtracting from the total value of the product at the end of each production or distibution stage the value of the goods bought at its inception . 
   it 's difficult to say not really . 
  engeland is by-far used the most . 
  most uk-things we hear about are related to england so no problem there . 
  but we tend to call the uk england as a whole even when not appropriate , for example the announcers yesterday at eurovision . 
  in news broadcasts or any other serious broadcasts it 's always verenigd koninkrijk . 
  do n't know when we 'd say groot-brittanni\u00eb . 
  travel shows ? 
  first words that come to mind is chill and poor . 
  for regular houses do n't forget the [ zaan house ] ( http://www.beneluxspoor.org/bnls/zaanse_schans_1_id1573.jpg ) , from the zaan area , and the [ limburg vakwerkhuis ] ( https://www.plaatsengids.nl/files/fotos/dk_20110420_4010vakwerkhuis_te_mheer_.jpg ) . 
  it 's the only regions that have a * very * specific style . 
  the rest can be discribed as `` brick dutch house '' . 
  idk , russians always seem very proud of their arts ( poetry , dance , etc.

  are there russia-specific things you * do * like ? 
  casinobrood here . 
  probably named by holidaygoers in france shopping at casino supermarket . 
  exclusively used for grilled cheese sandwiches here . 
  healthy pride exists . 
  would n't call it nationalist , which exists as well .
