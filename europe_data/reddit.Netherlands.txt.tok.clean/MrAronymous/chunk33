  atat\u00fcrk is probably as close to a benevolent dictator as they come . 
  they did n't though . 
  maybe they were in love , but they waited with an official relationship until he was 18 . 
  for real tho that shit is expensive here . 
  3 days, 
  our eurovision song contest win this year . 
  do you mean * van beethoven * , the 2nd generation dutch guy ? 
  they were banned after the black plague because of all the flees . 
  that 's why americans later reinvented them . 
  they think it will make the line go faster or something . 
  i do n't get it either . 
  ** xenos ** foreign ( aka unknown ) ** phobos ** fear says it all really . 
  the school i went to went back to teaching the [ old fashioned lower-case t ] ( https://nathaliebaudry.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/schrijven3.jpg ) after i graduated there . 
  i also remember some of the letters having some stylistic differences from when i went to school 15 years ago . 
  for example the q looked more like [ this ] ( http://freealphabetstencils.com/letter-stencils/poetic-cursive/uppercase-stencils/alphabetstencil-q.jpg ) . 
  also this is a somewhat neater [ example ] ( http://passievoorschrijven.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/handgeschreven-1024x682.jpg ) of what our writing is supposed to look like . 
  i know i do n't always either , but this was just an example . 
  and as i said i ca n't compare . 
  might be worth doing a search query on / r/skiing, 
  it 's been very up-and-down this year so far . 
  this weekend it was around 18 degrees , so pretty nice . 
   teens with drug problems turns out it 's a good fit for the park after all . 
  i have n't actually * been * to the americas to ski , but from reading online : * the snow is different . 
  powder-fetishes are non-existant here . 
  * europeans do n't respect lift lines and will step on your equipment . 
  * skiing in europe is cheaper and less of a luxury activity ( a big percentage of equipment is rented , which explains the above ) . 
  therefore it 's busier . 
  * many ski resorts consist of old mountain towns that are traffic-calmed during the week and apr\u00e8s-ski heavy at night . 
  * there 's barely any off-slope skiing here . 
  going off piste is at your own risk and a guide is ` required ' . 
  going out of bounds means that you 're on your own . 
  * the [ slope classifications ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piste ) are different here . 
  * europeans are less rushed . 
  it 's about the whole experience . 
  take a few slopes , then in the afternoon eat a big meal with a beer in a big mountain restaurant . 
  then chill in a sun chair for a bit before taking some more slopes . 
  * many ski resorts are above the tree line . 
  nah , that 's actually a good one , and aimed at foreign tourists . 
  [ here 's an example ] ( https://www.walibi.nl/nl ) . 
  i think vet derived from [ phat ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/phat ) . 
  tof derived from hebrew tov ( good ) , like mazzeltov . 
  and i think gaaf translates better as ` smooth ' . 
  6 weeks . 
  the country is split up in 3 parts ( first one gets free 22 july to last one starts at 27 august ) so foreigners can enjoy our company extra long . 
  well it 's more that they do n't think about what the song is actually saying . 
  if the lyrics would get translated it people would get it immediately ( how stupid it is ) . 
  reminds me of the drank & drugs outcry . 
  parents were distraught with the thought of elementary school children singing along to that . 
  some were even talking of bans . 
  never mind those top 40 songs about sex booze and bitches though . 
  i 'm fine with it being a lingua franca , but in my country it 's often used way too much when not even necessary . 
  often to be hip or because it 's considered cool . 
  like the uber dutch companies that only cater to dutch people and have a badly worded english tagline which does n't even make sense . 
  just stop . 
  if you would translate all of the songs on the radio you 'd get a massive cringe fest , people do n't really realize what they 're listening to and how stupid it would sound if they 'd actually think about it . 
  if that could go , yes please . 
  i also would like more language variety in media in general . 
  peoples republic of new netherland, 
  limburg 5 . 
  [ you 're about 2 years behind ] ( http://www.levensmiddelenkrant.nl/dossier/overname-c1000 ), 
  jolly, 
  marqt albert heijn / ekoplaza jumbo plus dirk / deen / coop vomar / dekamarkt / hoogvliet / spar lidl aldi correct me if i 'm wrong, 
  um , actually since 2013 there 's the national police , which uses regional units ( and one country-wide unit ) , but still considered one and the same agency . 
  naggy whiney sounding accents can get annoying very quickly . 
  luxembourgish ( i understand both french and german ) , written spanish , written danish and norwegian . 
  news item today : [ pick-up trucks becoming more popular ] ( https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/geld-en-werk/pick-up-in-opmars-zakelijke-rijder-betaalt-haast-geen-belasting ) still not a whole lot of them though . 
  the only american stuff i regularly buy is sweet potatoes . 
  because it 's a friendlier sounding and not whole unneccessary mouthful name that does n't sound like it was a temporary working title . 
  besides , it matches the name formula most other languages use for the country : local version of czech + local version of - ia . 
  hate all of the nos weather people . 
  [ helga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp2myjhijv8 ) is our true queen . 
  idk , ask [ erwin kroll ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lxyayolv0a ) . 
  i guess [ big baby pop ] ( https://www.ohnuts.com/showimage.cfm/extra-large/big%20baby%20pop%20sour.jpg ) , [ lange jan ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/06/d9/58/06d958681e0146584b9c1ed67a0b682a.jpg ) , [ dummy ] ( http://www.traktatieworkshop.nl/images/users/13596/2011zwemmentraktaties023.jpg ) . 
  i learned about the triangular trade , independence war , wwi/ii , vietnam , cold war, 
  that 's the consulate . 
  they 're building [ a new embassy ] ( http://dispatcheseurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/386-main5.jpg ) as we speak near wassenaar . 
  extremely underwhelming architecture . 
  luckily it 's hidden away so nobody has to see . 
  you forgot all the yuppy parents names : maan ( moon ) sterre ( star ) vlinder ( butterfly ) bloem ( flower ) storm ( storm ) wolf ( wolf ) bink ( tough bloke ) zilver ( silver ) zon ( sun ) splinter ( splinter ) * madelief ( daisy ) * merel ( blackbird ) names which co\u00efncidentally also mean something else : roemer ( a type of wine glass ) rein ( clean/pure ) rijk ( rich/empire ) rover ( robber ) taco ( taco ) karst ( limestone landscape ) kas ( greenhouse ) hielke ( little heel ) jaap ( big scar ) fos ( vos : fox ) foppe ( foppen : to fool someone ) douwe ( douwen : to carelessly push something ) jens ( jensen : to hit something with force ), 
  but when it comes to religious conservatism those are located and spread out over other areas . 
  it 's basically all-over . 
  schools here are free to do their religious education shtick , but only the extreme ones really follow through with it . 
  most elementary schools that are somewhat religious only do the bible stories in the morning . 
  in practice many high schools , though originally religious , are free of religion . 
  maatschappijleer ( society studies ) is mandatory and does feature different religions as well as politics . 
  besides the obvious ones like china , vietnam and bangladesh i see made in france the most . 
  glassware and such . 
  rather filthy slut . 
  raises hand . 
  isis is bad hmmkay . 
  i sometimes buy a pack of salmon filet to go with my diet . 
  i put it in my pasta . 
  but since the salmon shortage has basically doubled the price ( $ 3,50 for 100gr ) i passed on it the last time . 
  the strict la\u00efcit\u00e9 thing is very french . 
  when i said ` our ' i meant us europeans , as i 'm not even french . 
  the college sports thing and the fame and money that goes around in it is very absurd to us , no matter if the schools are private . 
  i have a not-so-common family name and my grandpa told me he knows our family originated from somewhere around dordrecht . 
  but that 's in , * south * holland ^ gasp , so i do n't wan na know . 
  because according to laicity ( la\u00efcit\u00e9 ) , religious gatherings do n't belong in a government-run school but in a religious club aka church/mosque/temple . 
  our schools are mostly focused on learning .
