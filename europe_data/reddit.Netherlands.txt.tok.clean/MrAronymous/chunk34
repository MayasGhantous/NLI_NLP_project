  the whole band/choir/sports stuff and all the nonsense surrounding it that goes on in american schools is very foreign to us . 
  some mcdonald 's locations are open 24/7 , but usually only the mcdrives . 
  so it 's not uncommon to see people walking or cycling through them . 
  well not knowing what they 're saying the extra reverb just sounds magical and dreamy lol . 
  [ thanks wasa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39mcdhqttrm ) but there 's so many . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlo_irbinns ), 
  that guy just deserves anything that 's coming for him . 
  the basic set of design rules , yes . 
  the issuers however have their own rules and regulations . 
  yes . 
  first 8 shared years of elementary school . 
  in year 8 you take a test which gives you a score that sort of determines your intelligence/way of thinking level . 
  together with the school 's advice you can then choose a ` middle school ' ( equivalent to high school ) . 
  narrowed down there are 3 levels of high school . 
  vmbo ( pre-vocational ) , havo ( ` senior secondary ' ) and vwo ( pre-university ) . 
  vmbo is split up in many different subparts too . 
  these levels can be taught within the same school , but there are also schools that only offer some of the levels . 
  all these levels have their follow-up in the form of research university ( wo ) or vocational education ( mbo ) and things in between ( hbo / university of applied sciences ) . 
  the good thing about this system is that you can level up . 
  so say from vmbo to havo , from havo to vwo . 
  same goes for the post-high school levels ( tertiary education ) . 
  after mbo you can do hbo and from a few years of hbo you will be admitted to wo , aka research university . 
  say you want to go from vmbo to hbo , you can either first do two years of havo or four years of mbo . 
  it may take some time , but if the will and results are there , it 's entirely possible to climb up . 
  [ explanatory video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hes7rfunqvu ) [ simple chart ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/dutch_education_system-en.svg/1200px-dutch_education_system-en.svg.png ) [ detailed chart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mpywb0v.jpg ) [ entire education system ] ( http://www.iamexpat.nl/app/webroot/upload/files/read-and-discuss/expat-page/news/education-system-in-netherlands.png ) ____ some more detail : * to complicate things even more there 's a ` split ' after the second ( vmbo ) and third year ( havo , vwo ) . 
  this means after a shared part students can now choose subjects of their liking . 
  they often come in ` packages ' with some you can add on extra . 
  vwo also splits into atheneum and gymnasium . 
  the only difference being that gymnasium really goes into detail more discussing certain subjects and that they get taught old greek and latin . 
  in vwo you must choose at least one foreign language ( besides mandatory english ) . 
  in havo these are optional ( dutch and english mandatory , max . 
  2 foreign languages optional ) . 
  a gymnasium person with no additional languages will have 4 mandatory languages ( dutch , english , greek , latin ) . 
  * in the first two years of high school is called the ` brugklas ' ( bridge class . 
  brugklasser being our version of ` freshmen ' ) , as you can still move levels up or down more easily as the differences are n't too pronounced yet . 
  before the ` split ' where you only follow classes you have chosen , classes are always kept together . 
  it 's also when you get a mandatory introduction into german and french . 
  * vmbo-t , the most common subgroup of vmbo , is the most theoretical version of the vmbo bunch and best to compare with havo and vwo . 
  it is often said that vmbo-t is for lazy havo children . 
  vmbo also has a sort of ` bad name ' in general . 
  it 's where ` stupid people go ' , eventhough ~ 75 % of the students go there , lol . 
  gymnasium ( again , part of vwo ) is where the ` nerds ' go , atheneum where the frat boy types go and havo is for wannabe-vwo fratboys . 
  but like the currency names we do keep them all singular . 
  3 * euro * , 45 * kilo * , 5 * liter * and so on . 
  fiat 500e was sold in the us and is very cheap 2nd hand ( have to import it first though ) , smart fortwo electric drive , ford focus electric . 
  we also have the [ carice ] ( http://caricecars.com/ ) light weight sports car . 
  just no . 
  same . 
  to me it 's like somebody telling me they 're praying to the easter bunny . 
  why ? 
  it delivers what it promises imho . 
   dutch kids are probably not the best behaved ones in restaurants . 
  it 's a mixed bag though , we 're probably somewhere in the middle . 
  i 've seen much worse . 
  we have [ a whole range ] ( http://snackbardendam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/snacks.jpg ) of deep-fried snacks to choose from . . 
  we mostly use opa/oma + nickname, 
  winkel in german still means corner , winkel in dutch means store . 
  merchandise was often stalled in the corners . 
  schlimm still means bad in german , in dutch slim now means clever . 
   the arab 's telephone : by word of mouth . 
   lmao rekt, 
  here it 's `` driving like a turk '' ... aka driving like a maniac . 
  doof probably started out with the same meaning . 
  just like * eng * ( narrow ) was the same word in dutch and german until the dutch meaning changed to scary , which is because many narrow things can be scary . 
  * enge steeg * nowadays means scary alley , but used to mean narrow alley . 
  has happened to a lot of words : verstaan ( understand  hear ) , stom ( deaf  stupid ) , wijf ( woman  shrew ), 
  distance has nothing to do with it , as our parliament members are n't deputies but representatives . 
  it 's all about the hierarchy ladder . 
  if you want something to reach the municipal parties , you can call write or tweet them . 
  you can do the same with national parties , but chances you reach them are smaller . 
  they do often answer tweets though . 
  chances you will get a reaction are bigger if you message the party person with the matching * portfolio * of the subject your issue is about . 
  there 's also party contact people who will answer questions if you contact the party itself . 
  [ * cries in dutch * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfbtnvrmlfw ), 
  but * he 's so beautiful *, 
  only j\u00f3nsi and some eurovision stuff if i do n't count anything french . 
  italian , turkish , indian , dutch snackbar , greek , mexican , chinese , japanese , surinamese , indonesian , thai , fried chicken , american . 
  [takeaway.com ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/takeaway.com ) is very popular here . 
  you can get liquor or groceries delivered too . 
  not really answering your question , but more of a random anecdote . 
  i witnessed a car crash 5 meters away from me . 
  it was n't a huge crash , but it was a small car and the force was big enough to flatten the nose big time and deploy airbags and all . 
  the driver was unconcious and the car was filling with air bag gas when luckily a bystander thought of opening the door . 
  that 's when i grabbed my phone and dialed 112 . 
  but i then realized because of the shock i was in i totally forgot how to speak french . 
  so gave my phone to some random bystander near me ( without saying anything to them ) and they called for me . 
  pretty awkward , but at least the emergency services came . 
  i just walked away after a while . 
  it 's fascinating . 
  go to any big city in france and you 'll find chips , dents or scratches on any car . 
  full-blown religious wars ? 
  could be fun . 
  whoops !, 
  my bike . 
  waiting for neighbourhood buses would get tiring real fast . 
  goede week ( * good week * ) / heilige week ( * holy week * ) / lijdensweek ( * suffering 's week * ) : 1 . 
  palmzondag - * palm sunday * 2 . 
  schortelwoensdag - * `` short ` ning wednesday '' * named after the not ringing the bells until the easter wake . 
  stille zaterdag / paaszaterdag - * silent saturday / easter saturday * paaswake - * easter wake * pasen - * easter * eerste paasdag / tweede paasdag - * first easter day / second easter day *, 
  for many people klm is part of their national pride and national identity .
