  so when news comes air-france-klm want to move flights to paris/air france because klm is profitable and air france is n't , we want to cut a bitch . 
  now i 've only flown with them on a european route ( not the full service experience ) , but anyway : 1 . 
  sure , why not . 
  the royal blue does have some magic to it . 
  from what i read online , yes . 
  their social media presence is textbook example to other companies . 
  they of course are n't as cheap as some other airlines for certain routes . 
  ca n't think of anything that would make them worse than other airlines . 
  maybe food ? 
  hmmno not really . 
  routes that are missing ( usually unprofitable ones ) will be filled in by cheaper airlines . 
  that 's fine . 
  with schiphol airport and our close proximity to london , brussels and dusseldorf we 're well connected here anyway . 
  that would be illegal under eu rules . 
  klm does have a big say in what happens at schiphol airport though . 
  well apart from making legislation , not much ? 
  it 's fine like this , they do n't need subsidies or anything . 
  though as they are still a source of national pride and a major job creator i bet most people would n't mind if it were really necessary . 
  [ paasstol ] ( http://www.kaaswinkeltjehoogendoorn.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/big_luxe-paasstol-1050-gram1.jpg ) which is the same as the christmas version . 
  sometimes with dried fruits or nuts in it . 
  [ matza ] ( http://www.hollandiamatzes.nl/nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/matzes-groot-vrij.png ) in many but not all households . 
  you often got them for free with a big bottle of soap . 
  i bought a pair of [ these ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/photography.prod.demandstudios.com/41f9255e-2864-4af8-aa12-7fc2fef3dbb4.jpg ) . 
  laundry room in the attic . 
  it 's a new-ish house ( 1990s ) so they took the space into account . 
  it 's simply located right next to the clustered water and central heating pipe shaft . 
  it 's everywhere . 
  tv shows show their twitter hashtag at the beginning . 
  old people have been flocking to it as well . 
  many young people are already looking for other apps lol . 
  definitely not here . 
  oh so that 's why they 're always shouting . 
  like the sims . 
  thing is , common stereotypes have a basis in truth . 
  this is n't one of those . 
  a single opinion does not a stereotype make . 
  say what now . 
  guess op is a sour amsterdammer . 
   amstelveen is ghetto city thanks for the random but amusing mention i guess ? 
  could 've mentioned almere , lelystad , zoetermeer or fucking rucphen , but no , * we * are clearly the ghetto . 
  spanish tourists walk so slowly . 
  like comically slow . 
  ah yeah , that 's the only time i guess . 
  but it was only mentioned as `` countries around the baltic sea '' . 
  i probably learned more from [ polly ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/kids-from-room-402/images/b/b7/polly.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140522195017 ) . 
  i think it has to do with the different political systems though . 
  in the us it is basically split into left/right or progressive/conservative . 
  within either of those there 's a lot of ground to be covered when it comes to all these issues . 
  with european parties you basically know what you 're getting because there 's more parties , which are more specifically based on political/social values . 
  really ? 
  i like the walking man better . 
  turns out it 's ( of course ) and [ actual thing ] ( http://www.moma.org/collection_images/resized/797/app_zoom/cri_210797.jpg ) !, 
  well basically most surinamese here are considered sort-of-dutch , considering a third of their population have lived here since their independence and have integrated fairly well . 
  i personally do n't feel * that * close to the rest of the kingdom or former colonies though , mainly because it 's far away and media interaction is n't really promoted or anything . 
  plus the fact that i get the feeling most of the people there tend to not like us very much . 
  say shit goes really bad and borders would close , would switzerland be able to sustain itself ? 
  yes . 
  in the non-eurofederalist sense , yes . 
  in the nazi-sense , no . 
  i 'd say here we do n't . 
  there is a clear difference in using `` countries around the mediterranean '' ( all of them ) and `` mediterranean countries '' ( southern europe , western asia ) . 
  i hate to say it but [ winx club ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iik0d5n7qco ) is pretty nostalgic . 
  it was voted `` greenest city in europe '' in 2014 . 
  lol . 
  pretty much all streets are tree-lined , but that 's about it . 
  economically , fine . 
  socially , ok . 
  i 'm really worried about the future though . 
  i have the feeling the new generation is getting screwed over big time . 
  in a country where generally national prosperity and pragmatism have mostly prevailed , individualism is taking nasty turns . 
  housing , financial and job insecurity are looming . 
  got ta be good ol' [ mont-saint-michel ] ( http://www.tourdefrance-manche.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mont-saint-michel.jpg ) . 
  yes . 
  gezellig can mean : a gezellig party , a gezellig evening , a gezellig restaurant , a gezellig family , gezellig house decorations , etc. 
  masking opinions as facts . 
  it depends on whom you talk to , but generally very much so . 
  there 's still a lot of flemish/dutch words that are used differently , of course , but local dialect sounds very much alike and even their ` regular dutch ' accents sound similar . 
  intonation and all . 
   [ theresa may laughing off ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/48uoqdkrajhxg/giphy.gif ) sorry i had to, 
  limburg ( be ) and limburg ( nl ) however . . 
  you 're not paying attention to geert wilders ' twitter account ? 
  how dare you . 
  oh no i love facism . 
  well they could watch * that * livestream on the logo website . 
  but no jt + awwwful american commentary . 
  ummm , actually , i 'm not sure about that , if you 're from the us . 
  they blocked the livestream last year because it was broadcasted on cable tv ( logotv ) for the first time . 
  ummm , i 'm not sure about that , if op is from the us . 
  they blocked the livestream last year because it was broadcasted on cable tv for the first time . 
  i would add [ bloed , zweet en tranen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgnleoatwzi ) . 
  and probably [ brabant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaizl1tz-so ) for brabant . 
  though contrary to popular belief , and unlike 's - hertogenbosch/den bosch , the name den haag is older than 's - gravenhage . 
  marseille . 
   counts of holland had their seat of power there \u2193 #  count 's court ( [ binnenhof ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/binnenhof ) : * inner court * ) \u2193 #  den haag ( * the hedge * around the court ) \u2193 #  the hague, 
  new zealand . 
  try to find a ( non-kids ) dutch film without a nude scene . 
  good luck . 
  brabantian + hollandic , yes . 
  be aware of the massive [ traffic circle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/st_peter%27s_square%2c_vatican_city_-_april_2007.jpg ) . 
  you 'll never get out .
