  what if , say , the turkish foreign minister were to threathen sanctions ? 
  just hypothetically of course . 
   so by being very tough on this , current government with the agreement of all other parties takes the wind out of wilders ' sails immediately . 
   that 's why this is happening . 
  that 's what you think is happening . 
  i 'm more aking to believe the official story : the government was n't very keen on turkish politicians coming to convince people here to vote yes for the turkish referendum . 
  however they tried to work out a solution for a meeting with dutch turks and turkish officials , but they did n't want it out in public . 
  not just because of wilders . 
  because most dutch people dislike the situation in turkey referendum thing . 
  then the turkish officials were n't cooperating and the turkish minister started threathening . 
  then the government cancelled the meeting with turkish officials , etcetera . 
  reading comprehension is art . 
  that 's what people do here . 
  or just eye contact and a wave in the mirror . 
  i did n't say it did , did i now . 
   the rules of this question are as follows : 1 . 
  we do n't know what kind of regimes they are . 
  the left-wing choice could be from frank-walter steinmeier with dictatorial power to a josef stalin the 2nd , and the same with the right-wing , it could anything from theresa may ruling like a sole autocrat , to literally adolf hitler ii . 
  and extremely religious counts as extreme right-wing conservative in my book . 
  call centres are often located in belgium . 
  cheap labor goes to india . 
  if we were to choose to stop dealing and trading with countries based on morals and ethics i at least think we should apply it the same across the board . 
  i guess left wing . 
  i deem the chance that they 'd be gay-ok bigger . 
  common enough , especially in cities . 
  hating our own language . 
  have you looked into buy-back car leasing programmes ? 
   lida in swedish means `` to suffer '' lijden . 
  same . 
  well not actually polite , but relatively . 
  because it uses the respectful words you use when you say `` somebody has passed '' . 
  so it 's sort of like `` go pass '' . 
  9/11 and the iraq war . 
  it was described in less than half a page though . 
  very popular in the amsterdam area still . 
  slingeren ( verb ) means sway/swing/dangle . 
  garlands . 
  or ` ga toch heen ' if you want to be more polite . 
  kind of hard to translate literaly but it essentially means ` go to death ' . 
  consonants at the end of words get [ devoiced ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/final-obstruent_devoicing ) . 
  d becomes t , b becomes p. always . 
  that 's also an important part of the dutch accent in foreign languages . 
  dood is pronounced like doot . 
  or doht in english , i guess . 
  it used to be ice cream shops , then the city rules got changed and the owner of the businesses started opening these waffle + nutella shops . 
  it 's said they use it to launder money . 
  no but if you ask people what they 're going to see you 'll hear them enthusiastically exclaim `` flower market ! '', 
  like it 's a must-see attraction because they 've seen it on a website or a map . 
  it really is n't . 
  the flower market . 
  it 's turned into a big tourist trap and no amsterdammer would ever buy their flowers there .

  in most european countries is celebrating cultures instead of heritage ( = bloodlines ) though . 
  ae and jcb cards are in 99 % only available in tourist and ultra high end shops . 
  better than belgium , worse than germany . 
  there 's also hearsay of people disliking wilders and choosing other parties because he approves trump . 
  fits into their propoganda . 
  i have trouble with our tv hosts copying the phrase though . 
  not efficient . 
  fuck me for posting an interesting fact . 
  if you take a bath in florida it will look blue . 
  look at [ a case of luxembourgism ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d33ccvnbhy ) caught by an australian . 
  zis is zo hott . 
   can you in all cases figure out if a person is native-born or a foreigner just based on their fluency level ? 
  nearly impossible to not have a slight accent if you 're a foreigner . 
  even germans who have been here for years will still have one . 
   what sorts of mistakes do foreigners mostly make ? 
  mixing up de/het ( the ) . 
  though some natives make errors here too , foreigners do it with ` easy ' words . 
  the original trump \u2122, 
  renault grand sc\u00e9nic ( 4.4 meters ), 
  there has been [ this incident ] ( http://www.elsevier.nl/cultuur-televisie/article/2014/09/nos-manipuleert-beelden-poetin-met-videomontage-1594843w/ ) . 
  yes . 
  unbearable , but it was worth it . 
  valley of the kings , egypt . 
   quite succesfully depends on whom you ask . 
  with working together comes making concessions . 
  i guess this time many of those were made ( mainly on the pvda side ), 
  or balletjetrap . 
  as do they in the amsterdam , the hague and rotterdam areas . 
  fun fact : the walloons have the same accent in french as the flemish have in dutch . 
  you tend to only know an amsterdam accent though . 
  [ lim ^ burg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrektvxj6_c ), 
  important to mention that wilders ' party ( pvv ) is populist , not a regular right wing one . 
  on health care and some social issues they are left wing . 
  we have a handful of small right wing parties and one traditional bigger one ( vvd ) that mixes liberalism with populism in a bid to try get some pvv voters back . 
  only hardcore idealist vote for the smaller parties , but that might change with the upcoming elections as they gain more influence since there 's no clear majority parties anymore . 
  oh man look at those mountains . 
  yup , in the municipal `` school garden '' . 
  potatoes , courgettes , corn , cabbage , carrots , flowers , etc. 
  the things i would like to see changed is prison probation duration ( currently about 1/3 of a total jail sentence ) , prison luxuries ( i 'm fine with them having a tv , but letting them have drugs or other luxuries is just ridiculous ) and monitoring bracelets ( often given instead of a proper jail sentence because it 's cheaper ) . 
  in the cities turks often own fruits and vegetables shops , which offer better quality at lower prices than many supermarkets . 
  they also own kebab shops + snack bar , as opposed to the regular dutch snack bars . 
  together with other immigrant groups they also often own the small supermarkets or convenience stores , though we do n't have as many of those , so not many stereotypes either . 
  during the friendship year celebration thing everybody was like `` why are we doing this again ? '' . 
  the fact that a week after russia 's ambassador was arrested for child abuse allegations our ambassador got assaulted in his own house was also . . very grown-up response but obviously a coincidence . .  are seen to be responsible meh , dunno . 
  at least heavily involved and responsible for the crimea clusterfuck . 
  they say belgian education is top-notch , but reading comprehension seems to be a weak point these days . 
  seriously .
