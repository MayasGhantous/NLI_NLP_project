   to avoid the overall point . 
  ironic . 
  perceived safety has gone down a bit yeah . 
  but just a really really tiny bit . 
  my fear of what 's going on with all the media and poltical bullshit is way bigger . 
  we used to have all these awful call-in quizzes for gullible people all day long . 
  then there was a law made against them , and now the astrotv bullshit has taken over , because it 's religion-ish and therefore harder to disprove or ban . 
  bbc english is already considered posh , compared to all the other accents . 
  because of tereotypes and all . 
  the reason for this is that our schools are all private intitutions , part of charitable foundations . 
  even `` public schools '' are private institutions , public just tells you about the way they teach . 
  therefore none of the schools are associated with any government . 
  they do get funding from the government and provided a building by the municipality , but there 's no direct connection , so no flag . 
  i 'm fully willing to admit that i skipped an s there . 
  it 's kind of obvious . 
  you ignoring your own error is just sad . 
  very stubborn . 
  here , give it another go . 
  https://nl.wiktionary.org/wiki/brussel https://nl.wiktionary.org/wiki/brussels when you realise you were wrong and feel so embarrassed and feel the sudden urge to concede , let me know ok ? 
  seriously , learn to read . 
  and when you 're done you can learn dutch too . 
  it 's possesive . 
  brussels \u2260 brussels ' ( en ) brussel \u2260 brussels ( nl ) it 's like saying belgium is spelled with an a , because the demonym is belgian . 
  downvoting me for pointing our [ your error ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/brussel_ ( stad \\ ) ) . 
  nuremberg , gothenburg , lisbon , i could go on and on . 
   ( yes , the `` s '' is there in dutch , too ) quite painful . 
  even moreso coming from a belgian person . 
   at least on par with that of the us they wish . 
  france is hardcore secularist . 
  for generation y i 've also heard rubbertegelgeneratie ( rubber tile generation ) . 
  there was a voxpop with politicians on tv this week but ca n't find it . 
  believe it was in jinek . 
  most parties do think that if you 'd remake the country you would pick a republic instead . 
  however there 's currently no need and thus no will to change stuff . 
  dutch people often have less trouble pronouncing them because we use most of them as well . 
  just try imagining how hard the eu is for native english speakers . 
  which is weird cause you rarely , if ever , hear one without one . 
  den haag becomes the hague , brussel/bruxelles becomes brussels and koeln becomes cologne . 
  so you 're basically full of shit . 
  noin-oend-nointzieg , if you still were n't sure . 
  this is why i dropped german in school . 
  it 's all their fault . 
  ah , too familiar . . 
  my spanish coworker pronounces every - ed verb ending too literally . 
  ` pronounced ' becomes ` pronoun-ced ' . 
  he also says ` cutted ' a lot . 
  it kills me lol . 
   i always dictate phone numbers etc , as single digits like everybody else does in dutch . 
  grouping them by two is a french thing . 
  do n't think so . 
  but ... disney world . 
  well i would n't be against a digital visa requirement for them . 
  you 're basic . 
  in the litteral sense of course . 
  the spanish are classed under hispanic . 
  lol . 
   because their grandparents were no , because pillarisation was still in full swing . 
  doubt you 'll find a whole lot of brabantian or limburgian youth now that will answer catholic when you ask about their religious/spiritual convictions . 
  that does n't mean local culture does n't still reflect the influence catholicism has had . 
  so catchy tho . 
  just like the ddr anthem was catchy and beautiful as hell . 
   partie where the party at, 
  i do n't mind people having their own racist bigot space , but calling for cleansing or extermination and such are a bridge too far . 
   while teachers are usually addressed with the formal form . 
  you 'd be surprised to how this has changed . 
  u is dying out very quickly among the youth . 
   do you sometimes make weird sentences to avoid using the second person because you 're not sure how you are supposed to talk to someone ? 
  instead of saying ` dank u ' or ` dank je ' ( thank you ) i often shorten it to dank , which sounds kind of awkward but saves me the stress of trying to figure out which one would be the most appropriate . 
  bedankt is the fancier non-distinctive version of thanks . 
  1581 best year of my life . 
  you have to be kidding me . 
  of all the things you choose this ? 
  wow . 
  our dyson handvacuum fucking broke . 
  we have barely used it but when we want to we can only do so for 3 seconds . 
  have they no heart . 
  your economy will collapse . 
  look at this potential rapist !, 
  he is in court now . 
  let 's spend 10 minutes interviewing random people in his neighbourhood and talk about feelings . 
  then constantly update everybody on the latest developments on the case , only to mention it in less than a minute of coverage that the man turned out to not be guilty or involved at all . 
  very rude . 
  amsterdam 's diemen is great too i 've heard . 
  they have a famous walking tour . 
  i 've heard out of the cities the infrastructure is lacking . 
  can anyone shine a light on that ? 
  that 's the thing that still amazes me here . 
  we have good cycle paths basically everywhere , even linking remote towns to each other . 
  i think you 're not totally right though . 
  california alone makes up about 75 % of the american stereotype . 
  he is presenting his opinion and arguments . 
  where are yours again ? 
  what matters to most people here is context . 
  you do n't put up a [ skyscraper in central amsterdam ] ( http://bakkerict.nl/efl/images/pub_1/8_1.jpg ) , or any other architectural historic sensitive area . 
  on the [ outskirts ] ( https://www.amsterdam.nl/publish/pages/808530/sp_sb_p_96_800x450.jpg ) , in less intact historic city centers or when it [ complements ] ( http://www.meesterz.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/foto-website-skyline-den-haag.png ) historic areas , less people mind . 
  i guess most people prefer the paris model over the london model , save rotterdam .
