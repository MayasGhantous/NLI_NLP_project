  rotterdam will build the first 200m + one ; [ zalmhaventoren ] ( http://images2.persgroep.net/rcs/ib8pexbxnowu9ngwwcsa7hn5prg/diocontent/68542161/_fill/1345/900/?appid=21791a8992982cd8da851550a453bd7f&amp;quality=0.9 ) . 
  even in rotterdam you can find sooo many nimbys , eventhough skyscrapers have basically become part of the local identity . 
  our local `` hamburgersaus '' is based on what they put on your [ sad hamburger ] ( http://f.jwwb.nl/public/l/c/r/temp-usbidkayakwvvnjzmpoy/pszpax/hamburgersausrecept.jpg ) in local cafeterias . 
  we also have '' [ american sauce ] ( http://www.appiehein.com/224-954-thickbox/american-fritessaus.jpg ) '' ( based on a very distinctive [ fritessaus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritessaus ) dutch mcdonald 's sell ) . 
  our standard mayo and ketchup mix is called '' [ whisky cocktail ] ( https://www.ah.nl.kpnis.nl/static/product/ahi_434d50303033383331_6_lowres_jpg.jpg ) '' here and is often associate with shrimps . 
  shhhh . 
  soon . 
  why is the milk cow often portayed black and white you ask ? 
  because they 're [ friesians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holstein_friesian_cattle ) !, 
  they have been exported around the world . 
  one day you 're a pussified commusocialist capitalist-hating hell hole , the next day you were the greatest utopia to ever exist untill the muslims converted everybody to shakira law . 
  you ca n't win with those people . 
  black and white thinkers/extremists . 
  they 'll just make some shit up to make it fit in their narrow minded narrative . 
  nuance is boring anyway . 
  how is it that i , from the other side of the ocean , can see this is clearly not true , but you ca n't ? 
  honestly baffling . 
  umm no , not exactly . 
  munt translates to both coin and mint . 
  in this case it means [ mint ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mint_ ( facility \\ ) ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swivbesd50 ), 
  rainbows and sunshine . 
  i mean i do n't know what you 're expecting except for criticism of your race politics . 
  you should still look up the rules and signs though . 
  they 're generally the same everywhere here , but you 're probably not used to the vienna convention signs . 
  it 's * so * german though . 
  touristic cities in southern europe are full of them . 
  do n't they put out big [ billboards ] ( https://i1.wp.com/deverkiezingswijzer.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/220-posterbord.jpg?fit=1024%2c768 ) on which campaign posters can be put ? 
  do n't the parties just buy regular advertising space ? 
  it can be a positive too , as small voices get heard this way . 
   it has been banned no it has n't . 
  they did n't do anything illegal , they simply did n't get enough support required to register and run in the elections . 
  anti-intellectualism , civil discourse , climate change . 
  i 've been to aruba . 
  it 's funny because they have the same traffic signs , road markings and supermarket products , so it feels very similar in a way . 
  most people speak the language too . 
  but everything else from buildings , cars and service is very much american-influenced/minded . 
  of the abc islands ( aruba , bonaire , cura\u00e7ao ) , aruba is definitely the outlier ( literally ) and that can be seen as they are culturally more distant to the other two islands . 
  cura\u00e7ao and bonaire have a bigger presence in media here , there are more dutch speakers and i feel like there is more interaction with the netherlands . 
  the rest of the islands ( st. eustatius , saba and sint maarten ) are ( quite ) unknown to many , which is kind of sad , seeing as two of them are part of the netherlands proper . 
   i ca n't remember that the wealth or lack of it of any politician here was ever a serious issue . 
  the only time was when tv hosts for public television and civil servants earned more than the prime minister . 
  that 's why we now have the [ balkenendenorm ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkenendenorm ) . 
  total coffeshops in the entire country ( 2014 ) : 591 coffeeshops in amsterdam : 193 ( ~ 1/3 of the country ) [ inhabitants per coffeeshop [ map ] ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rmobucs.png ), 
  many people use it ( business ) , many people do n't . 
  the reason why it 's not overly common is because it used to be really expensive to replay the messages i think . 
  for mobile at least . 
  do n't think the home phone with a tape has ever caught on . 
  not one decoratively painted plastered house ? 
  or is that too recent ? 
  that was n't really a secret though . 
  farms in each regions used to have different designs . 
  in the zaan region houses had their own [ traditional style ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=zaans+huis&amp;num=100&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1chhj_nlnl411nl411&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewivw4jvp8xrahvf7hokhxawbd4q_auiccgb#imgrc=_ ) . 
  in the cities it 's pretty much all just `` dutch style '' . 
  i think there 's only a minor difference in the kind of bricks depending on where you are . 
  limburg is another notable exeption , as many buildings [ are white here ] ( http://www.vvvlimburg.nl/media/53883/vakwerkwoning.jpg ) . 
  also they have many more romanesque style churches/buildings than elsewhere , where gothic ( - inspired ) is more prevalent . 
  [ for anyone wondering . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qplw6rb73zm ), 
  our security and justice minister , ard van der steur . 
  you know , the guy that 's in charge of the police forces and everything . 
  he 's a member of the ` liberal ' party ( vvd ) , the guys who are supposedly pro personal freedom and con government intrusion , meanwhile not supporting the legalisation of marijuana , which next to let people have more personal freedom could probably also save a lot of money from reduced crime and incoming taxes . 
  his litteral quote : '' [ i know people who have died of marijuana ] ( https://twitter.com/ardvandersteur/status/198139899042471937 ) '' . 
  it 's become a reddit meme . 
  old pic though . 
  half of [ these buildings ] ( https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5326/30891740383_ddb16fc868_h.jpg ) are n't on it . 
  well not really a `` business '' district , but the ministry buildings in the hague that have been built the last couple of decades are quite nice in my opinion . 
  [ just love ] ( http://www.meesterz.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/foto-website-skyline-den-haag.png ) . 
  [ the contrast ] ( http://static.zoom.nl/e2b8fbf93cfa37b5f4c0898b6cd964ab-blue-hour-skyline-the-hague.jpg ) . 
  after somebody gives `` daarom '' ( because ) for an answer : daarom is geen reden , als je van de trap af valt ben je snel beneden . 
  ( because is no reason , if you fall down the stairs you 're down pretty quickly ) it does n't much sense . 
  from my house . 
  fyi , many black tribes only came south after the whites already had arrived . 
  after 500 years of presence of whites i think it 's safe to say it can be considered their homeland . 
  bike , car , lightrail . 
  in that order . 
  um , really ? 
  because france has dashed sidelines while other countries do n't . 
  some countries have block marking for entries and exists . 
  ireland still has yellow lines . 
  neither was it in belgium or spain . 
  we 're just trendsetters like that . 
  i could tell you but then it would n't work anymore . 
   because `` that was the way the europeans did it . '', 
  something tells me this is the only reason this convention exists . 
  much like how resting your elbows on a table became bad etiquette after people simply decided so , just to have some differences between themselves and the common folk . 
  greeting people in a waiting room is considered polite here . 
  you wo n't offend anyone if you do n't though . 
  saying goodbye would only happen if you had an interaction with someone before . 
  but to be honest , shouting through the room takes way more courage as a shy person . 
  does it have worst en kaas tho . 
  two different events . 
  unfair competition . 
  on the other hand though . . often it 's very coincidental how so many czech cities use skoda trams , spanish cities caf trams french cities alstom trams . 
  and the police often buys national car brands too . 
  weird !, 
  [ tram extension ] ( http://www.railwaygazette.com/uploads/pics/tn_no-bergen-lagunen_extension_opening_atkins.jpg ) , no queen , 
  but also at [ public events ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/bybanen#/media/file:bybane\u00e5pning.jpg ) ( tram line opening ) . 
  or is this not typical ? 
  in norway they wear traditional clothing on many special occasions .
