  no , instead she kept on rambling and rambling . 
  show business has gone too far !, 
  more short traditional dresses with huge clevage !, 
  holy shit . 
   got 3rd place by russian voters - only due the jury votes we lost some places ( and still got 5 points ) yeah that was a surprise . 
  maybe they just really like james bondsy songs ? 
  or maybe it 's not as bad as we all think ? 
  who knows . 
  he 's talking about france you silly . 
  could you maybe explain whats going on in the vid ? 
  well since 80 % of russians is happy with the way putin rules it would surprise me . 
  edit : do n't have a source but read it somewhere on the interwebs . 
  do n't blame me for stating facts, 
  geert is in it twice !, 
  we win !, 
  i do n't think there 's an ` anti-eu ' sentiment . 
  more of an ` anti-more eu ' sentiment or ` anti-corruption and bureaucracy ' . 
   it really does not seem logical that there 's anti-eu sentiment growing in rich west europe and the poor east europe with bad infrastructure loving the eu you mean the net payers being more sceptic than the net receivers ? 
  sounds quite logical if you just phrase it differently . 
  there 's also the sterotypes of romanian criminal gangs . 
  like the people who pickpocket and steal their way through amsterdam . 
  they are on real estate websites !, 
  that 's why on may 1st this year they 're getting rid of the amsterdam-zuidoost name as a seperate place name . 
  so when you 'll search for a nice appartment , places in zuidoost will show up too !, 
  how about we get melilla out of schengen ? 
  i do n't even know what mine is .

  nah i misread the subtitles . 
  but i think he 's talking about stichting martijn . 
  oh yeah i was wrong . 
  he said the dutch juridical system acknowledges an organization which promotes pedophilia . 
  ( which is true ) my bad . 
  turns out he did n't exactly say that . 
  but here 's the link anyway ; from a belgian tv programme , so only dutch subtitles . 
  http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/videozone/programmas/terzake/ep_140122_terzake?video=1.1844300 the part starts at 2:30 . 
  hope there 's no geo-block . 
  putin said in a tv interview that the dutch government supports pedophelia . 
  i mean whut . 
  our supermarkets have actually become quite cheap ( ofc . 
  compared with average wage ) in the last decade or so . 
  it 's because of the price war albert heijn started that we now appear as number one on that un report that came out last week saying we have lot 's of nutricious food available for an acceptable price . 
  playing the devil 's advocate here , but it is pretty clear xiao wang did n't make it public he minded very much at first . 
  in a tv interview ( the one you probably saw ) gordon said he had heard from sources that xiao did n't mind , and he was genuine . 
  that 's also what was in the news paper . 
  xiao wang said he felt some negativity towards him during the recordings but did n't quite get what was going on , as he was more focused on his performance . 
  only after it had been broadcast and when everybody called gordon out , xiao wang rewatched his performance and judge 's commentary and he - rightly so - was n't amused . 
  so you ca n't blame gordon for that first interview . 
  you can blame him however for his tasteless joke . 
  i just do n't get it . 
  how can you ban something that 's not legal in the first place ? 
   equired that his face appear on the coins . 
  the bills would be a better fit for that , but i do n't think the ecb will allow i think he means wa portraits in those different styles , no ? 
  lived in france temporarily for 4 months and came to found out i did n't like the french . 
  ca n't think of anywhere else where i could feel at home either . 
  we have birthday calendars in our downstairs toilet-rooms !, 
  there are armies . 
  i mean i 'm not proposing it as a good solution , but stopping migrants from going to the border ( obvi not * all * ) is possible . 
  for anyone interested ; gouda is actually pronounced like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/nl-gouda.ogg ) . 
  so the correct english pronunciation should be ` gow-dah ' . 
  but like many things dutch , they get pronounced as if they were german or french . 
  ( eg : say ` van gogg ' for all i care , but van go ? 
  [ really ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/nl-vincent_van_gogh.ogg ) now ? ), 
  lots of horning and slow speeds were involved . 
  well , actually , that ferry did n't have a schedule as it was put into service only for this event . 
  the smaller ones did n't have any trouble getting across though , so they might 've actually stuck to the schedule . 
  we are/were great at baking cookies and bread . 
  the thing is though , the passports are n't fake . 
  i read somewhere that the anti-assad rebels have managed to get a hold on the machine that makes these passports . 
  i was just talking about that stuff with someone this afternoon about how much i was craving it . 
  it 's so bad . . but so gooodd . 
  very interesting . 
  [ here 's a clip ] ( https://youtu.be/xfejryn7r3g?t=1m36s ) of how dutch might have ` evolved ' from dutch in 500 ad to dutch from 500 years ago ( but in reverse order ) . 
  goes from sounding like the dutch dialects we know today to nordic to something more latin-like . 
  but do n't you get it ? 
  america are * the good guys * . 
  there 's a reason god blesses it every day . 
   well they should despise the soviet union , not russians . 
  i think the problem is that many russians long to see ` mother russia ' getting great again ; becoming a mighty empire ( more land , more influence in the world ) . 
  it 's pretty easy to dislike that idea , and the people that support it ( most russians , as far as i know ) . 
  it 's something really not wanted by other europeans , who would rather see russia settle down and work on real progress ( corruption , poverty , cultural progress etc. ), 
  of its own , without bothering ( bullying ) its neighbours . 
  because there is nothing for them in eastern turkey , and the turkish border region has enough trouble with isis already . 
  in the tv reports they interview them and they say they want life , not death , and they want to finish their studies . 
  people in camps in lebanon want to leave for europe because the international aid has been deminishing , and the kids have n't been getting an education for 4 years . 
  also they are n't allowed to work in lebanon anymore . 
  syrians are going through turkey , then by boat to greece . 
  then they want to go to western/northern europe just like the economic immigrants , because they want prosperity and stability . 
  not really sure why they are n't staying in western turkey though . . 
  guy beheads boss in factory full of workers and hangs up a banner with religious text on it . 
  how is that not meant to spread terror ? 
  uh , i think it was an election where people claimed it was counted unfairly . 
  so some people supported the ` winner ' , assad , and some people started to protest . 
  extremist then joined the protests against assad and a civil war broke out . 
  nextdoor isis was gained ground a bit later . 
  they later took advantage of the situation , and joined in the battle vs. assad . 
  um , remember most of the people at the macedonian border right now are syrians , who are fleeing isis/assad/war / death . 
  to them staying there is ` no option ' . 
  these are not the same as those people from africa . 
  not trying to convince you of any opinion btw , just clarifying . 
  ugh , did n't he also hang up a banner with some religion shizzle on it ?
