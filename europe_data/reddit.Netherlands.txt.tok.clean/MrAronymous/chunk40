  however , the hague was chosen as capital/county seat because it was n't a proper city , rather some villages in a forrest ( hence the name ) . 
  any city town/city with a moat or * burcht * ( and there 's a lot of those ) used to be more important at the time . 
  den haag is an official name though ( and the older one of the two ) , unlike den bosch . 
  fun fact : 's - hertogenbosch does have many translated names ; bois-le-duc , herzogenbusch , bolduque , bosducale . 
  exactly . 
  could be a nice experiment . 
  [ control alt delet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrrlfbv_c4w ), 
  meh , i 'm fine with it . 
  the most recent advertising change we had is that supermarkets and food companies will stop selling unhealty cookies and snacks with popular cartoon characters on them . 
  so say bye bye to your dora the explorer cookies and your spongebob cakes . 
  they now will only use them on healthier products . 
  interestingly , this change did n't come from the government but from the food industry itself . 
  i honestly think they should just ban nicotine from cigarettes . 
  same goes for the [ spelling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_issues_concerning_the_euro ) . 
  in spanish and french they say 5 * euros * , in dutch and italian they say 5 * euro * . 
  well prestigious because it 's expensive and in a fancy castle . 
  i believe the `` prestigiousity '' and validity of the diploma are at the same level of other universities . 
  starbucks as well . 
  nope , barely in daily speech . 
  nope , not in daily speech . 
  only in really really formal neutral english will it be pronounced , and in some south-usa accents . 
  th ' \u00f6-ro, 
  the l does n't actually get pronounced though . 
  so it 's more like worrrrrhhh ` wd .

  when they think it was german i was speaking ? 
  meh , only slightly bothered . 
  when they insist you 're german and do n't know geography , yeah , i get upset . 
  electric bicycles that go 45 km/h or faster ( speed pedelecs ) now belong to the * snorfiets * moped category , and therefore are banned from using most cycle paths within urban areas , require moped drivers license am , must have a small number plate attached to the back and have compulsary helmet usage . 
  saying things you do n't mean or making promises you ca n't fulfill in order to be polite or trying to be pleasing . 
  knock that shit right off . 
  do n't beat around the bush , you will cause confusion and will not be seen as trustworthy . 
  and that 's not * productive * or * efficient * to anyone . 
  do * not * write your own name on the birthday calendar hanging in the toilet . 
  it 's rude as hell . 
   not so much , realy again , unnuanced and untrue . 
  happy 2017 . 
   unheard sounds exactly like harry/harrie though . 
  belgians get so uptight about it though . 
  most of them are pretty sure any fries from any belgian guy tastes better than any dutch person can ever make them . 
  which of course is bullshit . 
  because the uk chips are thicker and therefore taste more potatoey . 
  food has a long ` oo ' ( u in spanish ? ), 
  sound with a sort of h. fhoooohd . 
  wood has a a similar sound but shorter . 
  woohd or wuhd foot on the other hand , has some weird sound change within the oo . 
  so like foo ^ uh t if said extremely slow . 
  you can forget about all of this if you do n't need to sound like a native speaker though . 
  incredibly useful if you want to piggyback tho, 
  so ducking catchy thooo, 
  in some towns near asylum centres local petty crime is on the rise . 
  however , those are commited by north africans trying to get asylum ( they are n't going to get it ) . 
  the actual refugees generally behave fine . 
  honestly , the most noticable country-wide effect is the rise of populism . 
  those people sure like to shout a lot , but the solutions they propose ( which they not even always do . . go figure ) are n't well thought-out or based in reality . 
  public ` debate ' getting grim is way worse than nearly anything the small amount those refugees do . 
  by ` getting us our country back ' so it can get better , they 're actually doing the opposite and making it worse . 
  the media here is america-obsessed and it 's fostering shallowness and anti-intelectualism . 
  we do it plenty in in speech . 
  in writing there 's only a couple which are considered `` tolerable '' : * ' t ( het/it ) * 'n ( een/a ) * zo 'n ( zo-een/one like that ) * m 'n ( mijn/my ) * z 'n ( zijn/his ) * ' k ( ik/me ) * da 's ( dat is/that is ) we also use apostrophies where the archaic * des * would have been , like in : 's - hertogenbosch , 's ochtends ( in the morning ) , 's middags ( in the afternoon ) , 's avonds ( in the evening ) , 's lands ... ( the country 's ... ), 
  no feeding allowed . 
  wow really , we 're worse than the belgian fat albert ? 
  especially since there 's so many cool traditional irish stuff to choose from . 
   nobody claims the land well apparently israeli settlers do . . ? 
   may have been used at that time for dutch people as well it 's pretty much certain that it means `` one of our own '' , since germany was n't united as a single country yet and `` duytschen '' could mean anyone from the alps to the north sea . 
  a lot of the odd-denomination coins can actually be spent ( but who would do that . . ) in stores inside the minting country . 
  i know . 
  but i feel like i need to point it out every time as to not make all the dutch flair wearers look like douchebags . 
  i 'm so confused . 
  to add ; many people who celebrate secular christmas just do gift-buying the regular way . 
   i wanted to convey that ok well you failed . 
  henk why do you always have to be so pendantic and non-related . 
  pretty much all towns still have coat of arms , calm down . 
  we use any varitation on vrolijk kerstfeest ( ` merry chistmasfest ' ) . 
  however , we have been using fijne feestdagen ( ` happy holidays ' ) for decades too . 
  mind you however , that it 's not some big political correct leftwing plot to dethrone christmas ( when people say it the existence of chanukah does n't even cross their mind !, 
  ) , it 's because we have so many holidays in december . 
  sinterklaas on the 5th ( you only start saying it after the 5th , but sinterklaas feels related to the ` holiday season ' anyway ) , two days of christmas followed by new year 's eve which is a big deal as well . 
  the first time discovering it could be such a controversial greeting in the us i was quite surprised . 
  then again i do n't support `` let 's not wish eachother merry christmas because some other religious people might get their feelings hurt '' ( great logic as well . . ) either . 
  recently some people just looove bringing over american traditions of getting offended over the apparantly lack of merry christmas wishing . 
  the right wing political screamers just love the oppurtunity to frame this ( as if it actually exists and is happening on a big scale ) as an attack on our culture . 
  and since elections are coming up soon the prime minister had a piece in the news paper this morning defending ` this truly dutch christian christmas tradition ' * . 
  like for fucks sake people . 
  ^ * though ^ the ^ point ^ made ^ about ^ the ^ public ^ broadcasting ^ company ^ being ^ too ^ politically ^ correct ^ [ ` december ^ wishes ? ', 
  ^ wtf ] ^ i ^ could ^ sort ^ of ^ agree ^ with ^ in ^ a ^ non-right-wing-screamer-doe-maar-normaal-way . 
  sure , but store does n't equal supermarket . 
  because stores ca n't be better in the netherlands , that would be impossible , right ? 
  as far as i know the quality is n't bad either . 
  london bombings were planned . 
  czech republic never made sense to me anyway . 
  i 'm guessing we just use modified french . 
  uh no . 
  just because it became ferrari nv does n't mean ferrari is dutch , just like fruittella by van melle is n't italian since the perfetti takeover . 
  lavazza , illy , segafredo , bertolli , rio mare , trenitalia , alitalia , prada , gucci , d&g , united colors of benetton , chicco , fiat , lancia , alfa romeo , lamborghini , ferrari , pirelli , ansaldobreda ( lol ) , agip,
