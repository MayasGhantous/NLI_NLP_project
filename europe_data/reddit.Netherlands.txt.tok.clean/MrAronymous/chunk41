  edit : damn somebody really spent a lot of their time on [ this article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terminology_of_the_low_countries# ), 
  europe who ? 
  where the netherlandish speaking netherlanders live . 
  statian . 
  done . 
  statian sounds fine . 
  patriotic even o7, 
   do the jokes translate well ? 
  often they do n't . 
  subtlely in humour does n't translate well into another language , especially when they use subtitles that ca n't be too long or too fast . 
  easily half of the jokes are lost . 
  i guess speed ( ice ) skating . 
  it 's because they call everybody who descends from a country with spanish heritage `` hispanic '' . 
  hispanic turns into spanish quite often because those countries all speak spanish . 
  yes . 
  how else am i watching it all the time . 
  you ca n't blame this massive clusterfuck entirely on the nazis now can you , 
  you can still also say `` geachte heer criticalspirit '' ( honorable lord criticalspirit ) , but it is pretty much only used when adressing somebody in written form . 
  it sounds just a little more formal/nicer than saying meneer . 
  and important note : mr. in dutch means * meester * ( master ) , an acedemic title . 
  it sucks for official forms though . 
  y' all is crazy . 
  sure it 's fair , but the ridiculously long names are annoying . 
  if you 're going to ask people about `` the great war '' here they will most likely stare at you blankly . 
  since wwii nobody has named it anything else than wwi . 
  they might even think of wwii when you mention it . 
  i got taught the whole story with the rising tensions between countries , first big scale air warfare , fighting in trenches , versailles treaty , etc. 
  not that much about what went on with our own country though ( trade , fleeing belgians , etc. ), 
  they opened [ one ] ( http://www.theartnewspaper.ru/public/uploads/posts/postbreakout/2016-12/e9203578-4aad-475c-aef9-eda377860c01.jpg ) in amsterdam just last week . 
  90 % of the afrikaans word can be traced back to dutch . 
  still does n't mean they 're the same . 
  and as / u/jadedpenguin said , afrikaners invented the word . 
  `` above the [ rivers ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/profile/john_parsons3/publication/256921537/figure/fig1/as:297581449105409@1447960354816/fig-1-map-of-the-netherlands-showing-the-rivers-rhine-and-meuse-and-the-monitoring.png ) '' and `` below the rivers '' . 
  it roughly correlates with the historical [ protestant/catholic division ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/nederlandgodsdienst1849.png/800px-nederlandgodsdienst1849.png ) and the cultural customs that come with that ( like carnaval and calvinism ) and the [ patat/friet division ] ( http://weareworldaholics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1-berlijnse-frietmuur-friet-patat-waw.png ) . 
  then there 's the randstad/western area ( biggest cities , [ most populated area ] ( http://www.paraplu7.nl/school/images/nederland1.gif ) , most media exposure , best infrastructure ) versus the rest of the country . 
  afrikaans , not dutch . 
   springbok , wildebeest no . 
   dollar via dutch daalder . 
  jail, 
  cookie ( koekje/koekie ) , snack ( snakken ) , coleslaw ( koolsla ) , brandy ( brandewijn ) , gin ( jenever ) . 
  c\u00fcl-de-ssac ? 
  unless you 're close to quebec i honestly doubt it . 
  this is so stupid . 
  afrikaans is n't dutch . 
  i know , it was le blague . 
  not a dish but '' [ american fries sauce ] ( http://www.appiehein.com/224-954-thickbox/american-fritessaus.jpg ) '' . 
  it 's called american because it tastes like the fritessaus they sell at mcdonald 's . 
  wow talking about cultural appropriation . 
  ( we do actually know of the existence of hollandaise . . ), 
  i plege allegiance to our dearest great leader kim jong-un and the glory he portrays . 
  same thing to us . 
  dutch ` catholic ' schools are rather tame though . 
  there 's barely anything catholic about them , if at all . 
  if you want an even remotely christian experience you have to go to a protestant school where they do practice these kinds of things . 
  at my school we used to do the bible stories/discussion opening , sometimes followed by a prayer ( depending on the teacher ) . 
  we also used to sing christian songs and have some christmas celebrations in a church . 
  also santa was banned , lol . 
  those things mentioned were the only things noticably christian though . 
  the only tradition we have remotely close to anything patriotic is [ putting out the flag with your school bag on it ] ( http://www.rsgtrompmeesters.nl/sites/default/files/afbeeldingen/algemeen/01_nieuws/160616_vlag_geslaagd.jpg ) when you passed your final high school exams . 
  and even that does n't have to do with patriotism , it 's more related to * putting out a flag * because that 's what you do when there 's something to be festive about . 
  calm down henk . 
  giant douche or turd sandwich ? 
  a warm douche sounds quite nice right now . 
  i was going to say san marino but then i took a look at your flag again and now i ca n't think of anyone . 
  so sad . 
  there 's actually a lot of culutral differences many people do n't know about . 
  i 'd argue that somebody living in overijssel might be culturally closer to somebody in western germany than flanders on many things . 
  when you look at just numbers and statistics denmark might be incredibly similar as well . 
  on the other hand , our shared history and cultural customs do increase our cultural connection quiiiite a bit . 
  rotterdam has long been a ` working class city ' ( poor ) . 
  half of the city population consists of not-too-well-off immigrant ( - descendants ) . 
  most middle and upper class folk live in the suburban towns surrounding the city . 
  a very un-dutch situation , as other major cities do n't have this divide on this big of a scale . 
  many parts in rotterdam proper used to be very dangerous and utterly shit to live in , but it has improved in recent years . 
  but those are at least close to something ( groningen city ) . 
  people have to complain about something , right . 
  but i guess their deal is that it is n't a documentary but an american fantasy story based on their cultural customs . 
  personally i would slightly get bothered only if my culture gets misrepresented and put in a bad light . 
  but it depends on the circumstances . 
  [ i can deal with this parody ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3a6pyulzqu ) , while [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/rkmhgi8eixm?t=13s ) is just cringy . 
  manneken pis is the kardashian of landmarks . 
  not that impressive yet people like to talk about it . 
  which also only had clothing . . and is going to close its 2 dutch stores soon . 
  hudson 's bay will enter the market in 2017 , which will use a lot of v&d 's old buildings . 
  we used to also have maison de bonneterie until 2014 . 
  the situation is just awful . 
  there 's no consensus anymore , i guess we 're in a transitional perdiod . 
  nowadays most tv commercials use je ( you , informal ) instead of u ( you , formal ) , and even the new generation kids say je to their grandmas , which totally weirds me out . 
  i call any high school teacher u and meneer/mevrouw ( sir/ma ` am ) because * that 's just what you do * . 
  when people just started calling people je , i found it incredibly rude and weird . 
  some teachers were ok with it , some were n't , but would n't speak out . 
  i still call people u at mbo ( vocational education ) , while i know it 's barely done anymore . 
  things are very informal here , i 'm guessing it 's the same for hbo and wo ( college/uni ) . 
  juf ( short for mejuffrouw ; miss ) and meester ( master ) are only used in elementary school . 
  they are combined with first names . 
  the point is that protestants [ do n't do much statue worship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beeldenstorm ) , therefore wo n't have small chapels or memorials . 
  we do n't have those chapels because a majority of the country is n't catholic . 
  i believe in limburg ( which has traditionally been catholic ) you will be able to find some roadside statues or monuments here and there . 
  you could have chosen the birthday circle and congratulation * everyone present at the birthday * with the birthday person 's birthday , birthday calendars hanging in toilets , but nooooo it had to be zwarte piet . 
  shrunk ?
