  how will i fit [ my shoes ] ( https://www.cz-milka.net/milka/schoko-carver/02.jpg ) on them then ? 
  because that 's what it is . 
  that 's not the point we 're discussing though , is it . 
  that 's not the point we 're discussing though , is it . 
  thank god no . 
  back in the day ( ~ 5yrs or so ) it could happen maybe thrice a year . 
  but since the douchebags started harrassing old people who do n't know what they 're getting into and who are too polite to hang up on them regulations have become more strict . 
  also there 's a ` national do n't call me register ' in which you can leave your phone number and voila . 
  but generally the mindset here would be that you 're annoying people and that it 's not a good way of doing business . 
  also the thing that happens during us election time of going through phone books and calling people to convince them to vote for a certain candidate would be considered a massive annoyance and `` breach of peace '' here . 
  it 's just very * not done * . 
  we do n't like people begging to your face either , has to do with our culture . 
  the usa has won the post-wwii cultural war from germany or france . 
  because i like the way my country is run and i do n't want them to be run like the others are . 
  in other words , i do n't have enough faith in the other peoples . 
  tiramisu seems to be most popular . 
  bonus points if [ store bought ] ( http://www.voordeelmuis.nl/img/gif/1288/1288406.gif ) . 
  there 's also [ stewed pears in syrup ] ( http://lindsayscooking.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/stoofpeertjes.jpg ) and all the stuff people can find in cooking magazines . 
  i bet even a [ vienneta ] ( http://letslookagain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/viennetta.jpg ) would make the top 10 , lol . 
  i hate that these have become so rare . 
  i would love to dress up for special occasions like the scottish and norwegians still do . 
  ` rich towns ' : * amsterdam * bloemendaal & aerdenhout * [ het gooi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gooi ) area which includes blaricum , naarden , laren , huizen , bussum and hilversum * wassenaar * rozendaal most of these are small/medium sized villages with large wooded areas and plenty of villas . 
  the gooi area is popular because of the nice nature and probably because of the vicinity of hilversum , which has traditionally been the tv and radio capital of the country . 
  our ` hillywood ' and beverly hills , so to speak . 
  shawarma , ham/pineapple , ` cheeseburger ' , frikandel ( limited . 
  i want one so bad ), 
  we also have [ permanent ones ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=woonwagenkamp&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj16tmhn9pqahvcthokhskecwgq_auiccgb&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1283 ) . 
  the trailer trashy kind . 
  they come in all sizes and shapes , but generally share the lack of any good taste . 
  [ this is an ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgpv6khqy-o ) from the socialist party about how healthcare is ` being stripped ' . 
  ( nsfw ), 
  in the same way an australian accent is foreign to the english . 
  vvd is basically the only big party that has not refused to work together with pvv , * on one condition * ; that he take the ` minder minder minder ' thing back . 
  especially when they have weird ass [ melodic intonation ] ( https://youtu.be/wly24c8fuug?t=20s ) where every sentence ends on a high note . 
  as a teenager you usually get an id card . 
  as it 's an `` official identification document '' you can use it basically anywhere within the eu . 
  drivers licenses are accepted at many locations for identification , but not at official institutions . 
  i believe you ca n't have both an id card and passport . 
  random fun fact : in norway they have their picture and id data on their . . bank card !, 
  they 'll gladly drive you to an atm on the way to jail . 
  i 'd even propose interlingua before spanish . 
  no , of turks in the netherlands 69 % voted akp . 
  in english you replace/repeat it with other verbs and stress them . 
  this does n't really work well in writing though . 
  you have n't watered the plants like i told you to . 
  - but i * have * watered the plants . 
  dividing by 0 is not possible , but diving by 2 * is * . 
  listen : do not run by the pool , but * do * have fun . 
  how this could work out : you 're confusing me . 
  have you well or not participated in that show last year ? 
  he well gave it to me , but then failed to provide me with instructions on how to use it , like he should have . 
  i well want to come along , but my cat is sick so i ca n't leave him here alone . 
  ` traditionally ' you are n't supposed to play christmas music or start decorating or even think about christmas at all before the 5th of december , as that 's when we celebrate saint nicholas . 
  decorations in public is usually played off as ` holidays decoration ' , meaning for sinterklaas , christmas and new years , which are all big celebrations , so it gets put up from november through january . 
  christmas eve is n't really celebrated , except by religious people who go to mass . 
  25 december is first christmas day , 26 is second christmas day . 
  it 's very common to spend one day with one side of the family , and the other day with the other side . 
  some hosts may cook a fancy dinner , many people will go [ gourmetten ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=gourmetten&amp;num=100&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1chhj_nlnl411nl411&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiv_u-d0cfqahuhasakhc5qbwoq_auiccgb ) , racletten or fondueing as it provides long-lasting table fun for everyone ( and fits in with the dutch mindset of having a * gezellig * old time and not being too fancy and impractical ) , restaurants will have their special menus and will be fully reserved . 
  second christmas day is a day where some big box stores open and is often saved for family leisure trips . 
  since we have sinterklaas as the traditional present-giving holiday , many people will celebrate christmas as the secular americanized or traditional christian holiday , just without the gifts . 
  some people will do presents on both , some will change from sinterklaas to christmas when the children are too old , some will switch to [ sinterklaasurprises ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinterklaas#saint_nicholas.27_eve_and_saint_nicholas.27_day ) . 
  fish hunting is super common . 
  do n't let him in on the secret , boys . 
  yeah some stores ( like mediamarkt ) do . 
  but they 're just piggybacking on the ` crazy low prices ' theme , eventhough the sales themselves are n't really shocking . 
  there 's much better sales throughout the year ( `` vat-free '' , 21 % off on nearly everything ) . 
  they 're everywhere . 
  most shows these days put a hashtag on screen when a show starts or right after the commercial break , so everybody uses the same one . 
  public space in the uk is one big traffic gutter .

  remember the irish used to be often treated the same as non-white . 
  the * irish * !,

  some people have to work you know !,

  i do want to mention though that the netherlands is relatively [ urban ] ( http://www.clo.nl/sites/default/files/infographics/0061_003k_clo_09_nl.png ) and you 're never * that * far away from something that resembles a city . 
  so it 's not like some places in the us where you can drive miles and miles and never come across a midsize town , which i can imagine deepens the cultural divide between rural and urban a lot . 
  here 's a [ map ] ( http://code.waag.org/buildings/ ) for pretty much all buildings the netherlands . 
  mine is from 1990 . 
  did they take any inspiration from [ the catalogue ] ( http://uglybelgianhouses.tumblr.com ) ? 
  maxis is n't a big box store anymore . 
  it 's just a glorified strip mall now . 
  it used to be a chain of big box stores as you know them abroad . 
  wikipedia says the big box store concept with food and non-food combined never really worked for the dutch , ` because you can get everything in other stores too ' . 
  after several takeovers business policies changed ( higher prices across the board which negated the need for people to get into the car and drive there ) which meant the end of it . 
  maxis was n't really ideally located though . 
  even hypermarkets are in more urban areas . 
  somewhere around the 70s we passed regulations against hypermarkets or big box stores along out-of-town main roads in general . 
  nowadays generally every town has its area with commercial buildings/offices where you can find do it yourself stores , car dealerships and those kind of things . 
  the stores and places for daily stuff get concentrated in/around a small neighbourhood shopping center ( in 1980  suburbs at least ) . 
  you 'd have to live in limburg though : (, 
  many people have reacted like this to the new ( unilingual ) signage the amsterdam metro is currently installing everywhere . 
  the designers are convinced though that because most of the words on the sign will be internationally understood ( metro , tram , bus , ferry , trein ) the only word non-dutch speaking people will have to learn is uitgang . 
  less words/fonts/colours on a sign makes it easier to read and comprehend . 
   henk and ingrid * sjonnie and anita ** * perceived as somewhat simpleminded ** perceived as ` white trash ', 
  the ddr one is really pretty , both melody and lyrically wise . 
  i 've been to both and seen many other 's opinions on the park online , it basically boils down to this : * paris is newer so better laid out . 
  beautiful landscaping and such . 
  it feels bigger than magic kingdom .
