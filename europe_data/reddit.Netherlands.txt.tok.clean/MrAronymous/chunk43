  also some pretty cool decorations and features you wo n't find in any of the other parks . 
  * paris has all climates , so no warm weather guaranteed . 
  you can go to disneyland in snow !, 
  quite magical , however not all attractions and restaurants may be open . 
  * do n't expect american level service . 
  the french can be somewhat grumpier , customer is n't always king , and the europeans are less overly-happy in general . 
  it 's not too bad though , and depends entirely on your own expectations and the specific situation in general . 
  * there 's cultural differences you should be aware about . 
  people bringing picknicks , people smoking , people not respecting lines , etc. 
  * the park is bilingual . 
  some rides are in english , some in french , but most attractions and shows use both ( in a way you do n't miss any info ) . 
  * ` disneyland paris ' consists of two parks ; disneyland park ( magic kingdom-style ) and disney 's hollywood studios . 
  the latter is the worst of all the disney parks around the globe , just to prepare you . 
  you could give it a chance , but it can be seen in ( half ) a day . 
  toystory playland , ratatouille and crush ' coaster are worth checking out . 
  feel free to ask some more ( specific ) questions if you have any !, 
  edit : on second thought , it seems like you were just curious on the park features and rides itself ; our it 's a small world has a colored facade ( which the train rides through ) , uses a multi-lingual soundtrack and has the usa featured as well . 
  fantasyland is more spaciously laid out with small water features and such . 
  the castle is sleeping beauty castle ( ch\u00e2teau de la belle au bois dormant ) . 
  it 's pink and ` more fairytale like ' because we already have real castles in europe . 
  it has square trees , a dragon cave and a stained glass gallery which tells the story of sleeping beauty . 
  tomorrowland does n't exist , we have discoverland instead . 
  it 's jules verne themed , so like a past view on the future . 
  there 's a nautilus walk through , space mountain : mission 2 is a proper roller coaster . 
  main street is very similar , only we have a gazebo on the town square and the big entry point is not the train station but the disneyland hotel instead . 
  there 's 2 arcades ( covered walkways ) parallel to main street , which connect to all shops , which is nice for when it 's raining and has some really nice deco . 
  our adventureland and frontierland are completely different . 
  the big centerpoint of frontierland is the big island ( ! ), 
  on which big thunder mountain railroad is situated . 
  phantom manor ( aka haunted mansion ) is very different and has a story line that interconnects with the story of frontierland . 
  in adventureland there 's no tom sawyer island , jungle cruise or splash mountain to be found , but we do have a massive robinson family treehouse and indiana jones rollercoaster . 
  there 's also a little bay with skull rock and a pirate ship , close to pirates of the caribbean . 
  what struck me in the us ( mainly epcot ) was how obviously everything was sponsored , it just felt weird . 
  here it 's just some decorative signs and menu items . 
  corn on the cob , spare ribs . 
  * ** federal ** * justice , security , foreign affairs , social security , defense * belgium * ** region ** * ` ground bound matters ' : infrastructure , economy , housing , employment * brussels , flanders , wallonia * ** community ** * ` cultural matters ' : culture , schools , healthcare , sports , language * flemish [ aka dutch-speaking ] ( same entity as flanders region ) , french , german . 
  ( brussels is bilingual dutch/french ), 
  pro-tip : with digital tv you can switch between available languages on multi-language channels like eurosport , euronews and arte . 
  in that case , less . 
  i can name 5 different regional accents in a country the size of west-virginia . 
  sure , the food and climate may not vary , there 's plenty of other regional differences per km \u00b2 . 
  american pancakes are kind of bland . . though . 
  you can barely eat them without syrup ; too dry . 
  i like you . 
  lmao . 
  it 's mentioned as our capital * city * in our constitution . 
  the same constitution which nulled previous city rights and all privileges that came with it . 
  technically amsterdam is our only city . 
  who in their right mind is still naming their kid that ? 
  confirming what i thought : [ nearly nobody ] ( https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/naam/is/petronella ) . 
  cetainly not all households have them here . 
  the people who do n't usually guesstimate the amount , use a measuring jug or cook/bake pre-packed things . 
   and why would you make up new words , when a perfectly fine one already exist . 
  we have trouble with this one . 
  we use the english ones because we are self-depreciating insecure americanophiles . 
  ` an enemy of my enemy is my friend ' . 
  the enemy being the eu , islam and established political parties . 
  those last 3 sound like they could be frisian . 
  and sure , daan is a normal boy name , but daantje - or basically any male name feminised with a diminutive ( - tje ) - is not . 
  i found a list of popular dutch names online and sorted out the old-fahioned ones . 
  the really grandparents-like sounding ones i 've marked in bold . 
  * of those that voted . 
  which is about 20 %, 
   le pin le pain la penne le paigne, 
  dropshot , you 'd love it . 
  * i ca n't believe it 's not * boterkoek . 
  retire this joke already . 
  western half as in a big sea of seperation ( literally ) between greece and the middle east . 
  turkey is only considered european because of eastern thrace and because of their proximity which has allowed for historical and cultural intermingling . 
  were the western half of turkey to be wiped off the map , turkey would 100 % be considered middle-eastern . 
  right ?!, 
  `` ooh switzerland , i love chocolate ! '' . 
  shut up already . 
  same goes for any other stupid ass stereotype . 
  we use the word ` siesta ' as a catch-all for ` afternoon break ' . 
  sleeping is not automatically implied . 
  `` christmas '' decorations or `` holidays '' decorations ? 
  my local shopping center uses the same from november through january . 
  they just remove the zwarte piet dolls after the 5th and it 'll be a christmas/new years thing . 
  better bring your glasses . 
  i 'll take de telegraaf any day . 
  public urination outside the built-up area . 
   ad : same as telegraaf wow telegraaf must be so offended right now . 
  ad is trash . 
  it 's because you 're very hypcritical when it comes to acting according to the values you cherish so much ( freedom , liberty , democracy , justice ) . 
  they consider it their unique selling point, 
  a footbath ( voetenbad ) would be using a tub or bowl or something . 
  pootjebaden is usually done at a pool or outside . 
  this thread turned out way more interesting than i thought it would . 
  people need to remember this . 
  too often i see things like `` french speaking part and flemish speaking part '' . 
  or `` i want to learn flemish '' . 
  sure , you could learn flemish , but it 's not what you actually mean . 
   ger ** man ** or ital ** ian ** i think it 's because of this . 
  and please do n't capitalise the t when it 's not used stand-alone or at the beginning of a sentence . 
  it looks just as stupid as the united states or the philippines . 
  zwijgen : the opposite of talking waaien : the blowing of the wind overzichtelijk : lit . 
  ` oversightly ' . 
  something that 's clear and comprehensive , but those two do n't really cover it pootjebaden : putting only your feet in the water gezin : direct family ( parent , siblings , sometimes even your pet ) gelukkig : the end-state of being happy dauwtrappen : to get up very early and do some walking in nature wel : opposite of not gunnen : to be very happy for somebody who has [ done/achieved ] something, 
  the end is near .
