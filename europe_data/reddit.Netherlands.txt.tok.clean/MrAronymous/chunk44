  and all these prepositions are skipped when ordering names alphabetically . 
  thus getting things like name | surname : -- | : -- eddie | halen , van herman | zande , van der in registers you 'll find it at the h . but not in belgium .

  i have n't heard of any problems with refugees , and i still find that hard to believe . 
  it 's true that the perceived safety for gay has gone down though , and that incidents still happen too often . 
  it 's sad , but i 'd never walk hand in hand with my boyfriend except in a busy shopping street . 
  the source of this however , is our native moroccan and turkish population . . go figure, 
  i guess it 's more expensive for the banks . 
   since there are more and more middle eastern refugees these instances of violence increase more and more . 
  i find this hard to believe . 
  what region are we talking about here ? 
  do you get all these subjects as individual items or is there an overlapping story or theme . 
  that would be a very american pronounciation . 
  the h is n't exactly pronounced `` by the book '' , but it makes the word sound like ` ow-her ' instead of simply ` our ' . 
  plus it seems like when pronouncing this word you 're exhaling just a tiny bit more air before the ow-sound . 
  when you lay it out on the table like this you can clearly see the connection with dutch ge/jij and u. 
  measuring system and banking system ( checks , lack of pin codes ), 
  oh yes yes yes . 
  this still went on until the 90s i believe . 
  from what i heard it 's one of the reasons why bus routes are n't more frequent ; they need to be split more often to reach * each and every * neighbourhood .

  so basically eurovision . 
  but . . but . . have to have a stop within every 500m ! 1 !, 
  the $ 5 ride ticket connexxion makes you buy if you do n't have an ov-chipkaart is outrageous . 
  not really . 
  afaik our trains are cheaper than in surrounding countries . 
  train personnel does the most public strikes i think . 
  but even then they do it in a way that it does n't really affect the travellers too much . 
  second largest group is the police i guess . 
  their way of striking is not writing out tickets . .

  all our newer ` subruban ' neighbourhoods (  1950 ) are set up to have some basic shops in the center of them or at least at walking distance . 
  they 're also fairly dense , compared to other countries . 
  that 's why we have lots of small local ` shopping centers ' ( sometimes barely even worthy of the name ) with a supermarket , bakery , hairdressers , etc. 
  and barely any big malls . 
  those are reserved for the bigger towns and usually come in covered street/arcade form instad of your typical american mall . 
  this makes cycling to the supermarket a breeze . 
  other aspects of our infrastructure ( segregation , strict road hierarchy , etc. ), 
  help a lot as well . 
  i 'd have never thought of that . 
  totes . 
  we 'd skip almere and rethink lelystad . 
  totally . 
  we could finally redo flevoland . 
  current dutch music could all be described as `` folk '' music , hence why it 's not very popular . 
  people generally think and say they do n't like it because it 's dutch , but that 's bullshit . 
  they do n't like it because it 's cheesy shitty music . 
  we 're the country of electronic and house music , but that 's not reflected in our dutch songs . 
  if we 'd have more artist making dutch songs in different ( [ more modern ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-h5qkmzcl4 ) ) genres , it might get more popular . 
  [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swivbesd50 ) rose to fame because of its controversial lyrics and catchy beat . 
  meanwhile the lyrics are not more shocking than every rap song out there , but because it suddenly was in dutch the words got a lot more weight to them . 
  i bet if this song did n't have this catchy modern beat but something more classic r & b-ish , it would 've never become the hit it became .

  it used to be quite big in my neighbourhood . 
  but i guess all the children have grown up and their parents are still living in the house so not all childless households have been replaced yet . 
  we only got 2 groups last year . 
  i 'm not complaining though , more candy for me . 
  does n't help that half of the population seems to be unaware it 's even a thing . 
  it used to be catholic-only , and some villages participate , some do n't . 
  it even depends on the neighbourhood , so no one really knows . 
  it 's was very common to put out some halloween decorations on the 11th , as halloween was n't really a thing here and it was the only time you could carve some pumpkins if you 're into that shit . 
  now halloween is gaining ground though . 
  it 's weird . 
  you can just turn off the bell if you have an electric one . 
  no it will stay exactly the same .

  nope . 
  my school had a seperate literature class , but there we only got to read a sonnet ( shakespear , probs . 
  translated to dutch , maybe but i do n't remember ) to know what a sonnet is . 
  not to go deeper into the meaning of the particular poem . 
   ` special manoeuvres ' however , you can not fail based on those alone . 
  you get judged on if you 're overall competent . 
  throwing anything away you make at school is stupid .

  it sounds more poetic in dutch lol . 
  it would already look better with less useless concrete . 
  jaywalking is an american thing . 
  we do have obvious rules as not to cross a motorway or cross within a certain distance removed from a designated crossing place . 
   in almost every super market ummm no it is n't . 
  i see these twice a week . 
  so good at english that it makes you suck at dutch . 
  may the odds be ever in your favor . 
  pale heaven . 
  statesians has a nice ring to it . 
  tv kantine mocking all kinds of ( inter ) national celebrities . 
  way over the top and often kind of brash , still funny most of the time though . 
  most of the celebrities and jokes are in dutch so you would n't get it .
