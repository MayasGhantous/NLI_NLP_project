  [ you know this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8wde1ffvpg ) . 
  [ this one 's great as well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih1mzrh_ux4 ) . 
  [ as is this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtrlwrihrbu ) . 
  koefnoen . 
  they make sketches and parodies . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thsqrhbjre ) , [ making fun of greece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi9hno45fc8 ) , [ making fun of geert wilders ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nj5oloerbs ) * what satire is popular in your country ? 
  we love cabaret and spoofs . 
  * what issues are currently popular ? 
  usually just current issues and politics . 
  * what is the style of it ? 
  video editing , skits , sketches , cabaret , etc. 
  depends on the season of the year , but the top three is boer zoekt vrouw ( farmer seeks wife , reality tv dating show ) heel holland bakt ( our version of the great british bake off ) wie is de mol ( who is the mole , reality tv game show ), 
  i would happily halve the number of tourists so it would look less like amsteldisney . 
  buses are getting robbed here as well . 
  99/10 cases it 's , uhm , youths . 
  i do n't know man , driving a buk rocket system across the border and back kinda sounds like direct involvement to me . 
  well we now have a `` 50 + '' political party . 
  they and the baby boomers loove to claim how selfish and lazy the youth of today are , that they have built our country , and that the elderly have been hit the hardest in the budget cuts . 
  which is not exactly true . 
  not only do they have it relatively well on a national and european scale , they 're also actively creating a bleak future for the current youth by being unsolidary and being stuck in the `` fuck you , got mine '' attitude in times where there 's barely any permanent job offerings anymore , no affordable housing for younger folk and automatisation is luring . 
  the generation ` that built our country ' after wwii is actually the generation of their parents . 
  they merely profited from the economic boom and all its benefits that followed . 
  then again , i 'm not sure if * most * elederly would subscribe to the train of thought i just described . 
  but the group is big enough . 
  the idea was nice , but the execution kind of mweh . 
  we should just start over . 
  why the double letters ? 
  do you say them longer , does it change the stress or is it to mark a sound change . 
  you might want to look into the scheepvaartmuseum . 
  not a military museum per se , but our maritime history and navy go hand in hand . 
  it 's been quite recently modernized to also cater to kids , but it still has some great old fashioned displays . 
  / r/learndutch be sure to clearly seperate the languages in your mind . 
  the closeness of german to dutch might be an advantage , untill you struggle because they 're similar yet not the same . 
  with limburgians the intonation pitch transfers to english . 
  the rotterdam and the hague accents vowel sounds somehow work in english as well . 
  ( rye ) bread cheese , butter , ( butter ) milk , yoghurt potatoes ( green ) beans , carrots , cauliflower , all kinds of cabbages cheap meats ; minced meat , etc. 
  it 's alright . 
  our buildings and equipment are usually top notch . 
  prices , service , coverage and waiting times depend and can be quite meh . 
  i do like our gp referral system though . 
  can they swim ? 
  pretty sure that service dogs must be allowed at most places - if not all - by law . 
  we do n't have doggie corners in restaurants though . 
  sometimes people take their dogs along into restaurants ( not fancy ones mind you ) , public transit , on their bike , along their bike , etc. 
  many cities have a dog tax you have to pay and it 's considered your own responsibility to take care of the dog . 
  that includes walking them 3 times a day as well as picking up after them and accepting you ca n't take faraway vacations or bring them to all stores and places . 
  some municipalities have set out certain `` free walk areas '' in green areas where you can unleash them without worrying about a playground , trash or anything bothersome being around . 
  these have special trash cans and [ dog poop scoop bags ] ( http://decentrale.regelgeving.overheid.nl/cvdr/images/steenwijkerland/i20088.jpg ) available . 
  where we talk about filthy [ spanjols ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philip_ii_of_spain ) . 
  swiss german is like nails on a chalkboard . 
  or some finnish accents in english . . * shudder *, 
  not crazy popular , but it 's available . 
  i think the most sold turkey item would be slices that people put on toast or bread . 
  we used to have framed artwork on the wall in an office/storage room here that belonged to my mom . 
  it had a ` backlit silhouet ' of jesus ' crusification . 
  however , when i was a small child it used to creep me out because i did n't recognize anything in the shape , let alone somebody hanging on a cross . 
  i even gave the strange ( evil and scary , in my mind ) black shape a name , like it was some kind of demonic thing , ca n't remember the name anymore . 
  i complained ( i might have cried ) and got it removed . 
  so no visible jesus in this house . 
  funny is subjective . 
   pronounced like mon cul i thought i knew a fair bit of french but . . how even . 
  does n't make any sense to me . 
  geel ( yellow ) kontich ( bum-ish ) aarschot ( sounds like ass shot ) spermalie ( ` spermalia ' ) goor ( gross ) jezus-eik ( jesus oak ), 
  i always chuckle when i see neuss ( neus is dutch for nose ) . 
   pijnacker ( pain acre ) pine acre . 
  bad politicians , yes . 
  worst people in the country ? 
  not by a long shot . 
  we insert snickers bars . 
  very uncommon . 
  we do have some public shelters built together with large infrastructural projects , but by far not enough to keep the entire population safe . 
  the ones we do have ( built in the 70s ) are actually starting to be being decomissioned as of recently , `` since the cold war is over '' . 
  have always found it short-sightened , even before russia went full retard again in 2014 . 
  living in your own city and sometimes having to order in english can be very annoying . 
  only older houses in fancier areas do . 
  most houses have [ this ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=kruipruimte&amp;num=100&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1chhj_nlnl411nl411&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj8-phu-cvpahwctbokhxzsaduq_auiccgb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1077&amp;dpr=0.75 ) . 
  1839 worst year of my life . 
  it would require post-ddr-style rebuilding all over again . 
  [ lmao ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seex3ouuiii ), 
  concerning the cheap buildings , that 's the case in a lot of places in the us . 
  see it all the time on architecture forums . 
  nope . 
  government organisations have switched to fiets quite a while ago . 
  smilarly , we do n't use the world ` rijwiel ' [ ridewheel ] anymore , but fiets instead . 
  diarrhea . 
  like wut . 
  but i guess we should put the blame on those latins . 
  because we 're the usa 's lap dog ( aka bitch ) . 
  well i knew we were going to stay in a car-dependent area , but to really see it for yourself is quite striking . 
  our hotel ( florida , near disney ) was situated along a large main road . 
  plenty of ( fast ) food establishment on either side , but tough luck if you wanted to just walk to there from the other side , where the hotel was . 
  no sidewalks , no marked crossings . 
  it was new to me , coming from a place where even industrial areas have sidewalks and cycle paths . 
  the roads were alright , the drivers massively inefficient . 
  big ass trucks using any lane they please can be quite scary if you 're not used to it . 
  so many broken tires just laying along the regular highway though . 
  do n't know what that was all about . 
  and i saw more ` that does n't look safe ' - cars than i 've seen in my entire life . 
  also saw a woman who fully occupied a 2 person bench on my first night there . 
  such a nice welcome .
