  and all the buildings look so damn cheap . 
  like everywhere . 
  the interior of our place was nice though , got to see what ` normal ' staircase looks like for once . 
  well if i 'm saying it 's something else opposed to nutella , it 's not nutella . 
  it 's basically the knock-off version of nutella , but there 's a minor difference in flavor . 
  though they have cool [ colours ] ( http://static.voordeelmuis.nl/img/jpg/1509/1509168.jpg ) and different [ flavours ] ( http://www.supermarktaanbiedingen.com/public/images/product/2010/7/2245-debestewittechocoladepasta_1247489975.gif ) . 
  any cheese out of a can . 
  never judge a book by its cover my dear . 
  i 'll answer your question by thinking of the most dutch-only products i can think of . 
  * peanut butter we have [ our own kinds ] ( https://gegrom.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/pindakaasmg_0635.jpg ) ( calv\u00e9 is preferred ) , they 're less processed than the american version . 
  you can find that one too at some stores though . 
  also we eat a lot of `` chocolate butter '' as opposed to nutella . 
  * jam/jelly/preserves plenty of variety . 
  there 's also [ appelstroop ] ( http://www.itsalldutchtome.com.au/images/1922.jpg ) which is a sort of thick syrup . 
  * ready to eat meals [ pizzaburgers ] ( http://www.pizzaburger.nl/assets/user_upload/pizzaburger-700x350.jpg ) , [ traditional dutch ] ( http://static.voordeelmuis.nl/img/jpg/1382/1382502.jpg ) , [ asian ] ( http://www.netpanel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vezetmaaltijden.jpg ) , pasta , you name it . 
  most are not frozen though , just refrigerated . 
  * common breakfast items cheese , [ all kinds of sprinkles ] ( http://www.foodlog.nl/images/uploads/de-ruijter-de-broodversierd.jpg ) , chocolate butter , peanut butter , some cereals . 
  mostly just bread though . 
  * common beverages milk , lemonade , water , tea , coffee , juices , soft drinks . 
  a special shout-out to [ cassis ] ( http://static-cdn.holland-at-home.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/900x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/0/000635_cassis-homecaroussel-product_1.jpg ) . 
  * common condiments [ these ] ( http://login.creativefellows.nl/content/dreamcatchcreate/th/prv-remia-topdown.jpg ) . 
  we whip out [ other sauces ] ( https://eviewer.netmedia-europe.be/cache/server?type=image&amp;origin=pf&amp;source=%2fpromofolder_nl%2farticles%2f2013%2f07%2f17%2f11266%2fn_bonisp049n0000041.jpg ) too when grilling . 
  * when it comes to pasta do you buy dry pasta/canned sauce or make from scratch ? 
  dry/jar . 
  * common alcoholic beverages ? 
  [ beer ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/an80d4scmaepazy.jpg:large ) / radler/corona , wine , ros\u00e9 , sprakling cider , prosecco , gin & tonic . 
  no , they 're not . 
  they have anise in them , are extremely crunchy and get stuck in between your teeth . 
  we only have one neighbourhood with some [ villa estates ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.3154703,4.8452918,327m/data=!3m1!1e3 ) . 
  the rest are mostly [ some villas ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.3044248,4.8579484,3a,75y,35.67h,83.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srwwitg-3c2eez0e7vnjmia!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) spread through the town here and there . 
  we also have some old ' [ country houses ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.3021713,4.9009243,3a,75y,321.45h,87.26t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sepo5oncbwfjucxjljr8h2q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) ' along the river ( pretty sure some of them come as klm collectibles ) where the rich used to spend their leisure time back in the old days . 
  it 's also where rich [ people live now ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.3171263,4.9061666,3a,75y,15.56h,80.12t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sloy7bq2oiprivjh_rjhvfa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  the places where all the celebrities live look similar , often even more like a ` regular ' house and not as impressive from the outside compared to elswhere in the world . 
  see , you have two nation-alist parties to choose from !, 
  i use our [ failed high speed train ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fyra ) project to go to school a lot . 
  it only costs me $ 2,50 extra each way and saves half the time . 
  small talk is ok , heavily depending on location and context . 
  `` true friend '' is somebody you 'd almost tell anything to . 
  these are usually your best friends from elementary school or high school . 
  it 's very hard to get into the dutch friend circle post-university . 
  when you just met somebody they 're definitely not your friend . 
  they 're not even an acquaintance . 
  you can communicate with strangers , but you have to have a reason for it , otherwise it 's creepy . 
   you 'll have to take that up with our government , not our people . 
  weak cop-out bro . 
  she also wears funny hats . 
  she 's part of that cool kidz club . 
   member states outright rejected by referendum  happily accepted its terms without referendum, 
  well it 's limburg , so might as well be another country , but have you checked out the chirstmas market in valkenburg ? 
  it 's in a cave !, 
  baco ( bacardi cola ) and gin tonic are pretty popular . 
  oh yes , all those british immigrants refusing to learn our language and stop drinking tea with milk . 
  on the other hand , americans are way quicker to consider somebody a friend . 
  salt , egg , [ hamburger sauce ] ( https://www.ah.nl.kpnis.nl/static/product/ahi_434d50313335343730_1_lowres_jpg.jpg ), 
   unless your family has lived in some kind of reservation . 
  and even then . . 
  there are villages in the us and canada where there 's people still adhering to dutch traditions . . that have died out here a 100 years ago . 
  [ uhhh . 
  are n't you forgetting that neighbour island of yours ? 
  i mean you influenced them enough for you to be very similar . 
  gouda holland is a cheese from the netherlands , but still you can buy gouda from everywhere around the world . 
  `` pilsener '' therefore means `` pilsen style '' . 
  a big factor is that pronunciation is n't really an issue . 
  aken/aachen , keulen/k \u00f6ln , nuremberg/n \u00fcrnberg , kleef/kleve , osnabrugge/osnabr \u00fcck are all very much alike prunounciation-wise . 
  the way we pronounce m\u00fcnchen ( m\u00fcnsjen ) is odd though . 
  the true reason we stopped using endonyms on signs is . . pragmatism . 
  a true dutch virtue you wo n't find past the southern border . 
   bergen , vlissingen , nijmegen , wageningen , groningen , leiden also known in french as mons , flessingue , nim\u00e8gue , wageningue , groningue , leyde . 
  does make them sound a lot fancier . 
  but for the love of god please make sure you have enough money and opportunity to sleep somewhere * inside * . 
  often there 's people on the local subreddit claiming they 'll `` just sleep in public somewhere lolz '' . 
  hell to the no . 
  i can definitely tell when somebody looks a dutch/german look , scandinavian , british/irish , eastern-slavic by their facial features . 
  southerners can usually only be recognized by skin tone . 
   i would also like to know the one thing that my wife ca n't miss while we are in amsterdam definitely do the walking tour of diemen . 
  ^ just ^ kidding . 
  my tip would be to go out of the city center now and then . 
  you 'll see more amsterdammers and less fellow tourists that way . 
  it 's nice to be able to alternate between busier areas full of history and the newer areas that feel less hectic . 
  instead of going to the anne frank house you could go see the exterior of the house that she grew up in . 
  go see some amsterdam school architecture and some modern architecture . 
  walk along plantage middenlaan to van woustraat . 
  go be a hipster in de hallen . 
  take the free ferry to noord . 
   they do n't actually believe britons are roast beef . 
  toute my vie is un lie . 
  jongens ( boys ) film . 
  a coming of age story with an lgbt theme . 
  oh my god i love rita way too much . 
  maple syrup that does n't cost $ 12/200ml . 
  i 'm aware it 's usually associated with canada , but still . 
  small flies , big flies , noisy flies , crane flies , ( small ) musquito 's , ( harmless ) spiders , moths . 
  have also seen 2 grasshoppers on my window this year . 
  since ~ 2005 they are recommended for small children and in october this year they 're going to be mandatory for e-bikes that go 45 hm/h . 
  but that 's it . 
  sort of . 
  since i do n't speak finnish i do n't know which one you 're talking about . 
  sure you would call anyone related to you relatives , but if you would introduce your uncle to somebody would you really say `` he 's a relative of mine '' or would you call him family . 
  exactly . 
  pretty sure you ca n't : but i * have * done the dishes .
