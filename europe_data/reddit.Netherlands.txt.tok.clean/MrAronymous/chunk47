  but i * do * want to go out for dinner . 
  but what i said * is * true . 
  i have to put words into italics to show the exact meaning . 
  you really need this word . 
  that would be ` tevreden ' . 
  it 's not the same . 
  it 's `` i 'm ( really ) happy for you , i think you deserve it '' in verb form . 
  fun fact , the dutch one is the only version in which they actually talk . 
  which are two words . 
  zat is also used in the ` enough ' sense . 
  ik ben het zat - i 'm sick of it ik heb ( er al ) zat - i have plenty ( of them already ) er zijn zat soorten - there 's plenty of variety, 
   it 's actually pretty useless so we do n't need it . 
  gezin : first degree family . 
  so your parents and siblings ( a word we need in dutch btw ) and maybe somebody who lives in your household , as opposed to your * whole * family . 
  wel : the opposite word of not . 
  gelukkig : it means happy , but it goes much deeper than the somewhat superficial happy . 
  happy can mean the same as cheerful and glad . 
  gelukkig is more of an end-state of being satisfied with life . 
  gunnen : a verb which means you are very happy for somebody having something . 
  maybe it 's a western/eastern divide . 
  ranja sounds extremely uncommon and childish to me . 
  well we say * limonade * and say it like limo-nade , so the connection is n't really there in most people 's minds . 
  the teisseire kind of stuff is our default lemonade . 
  yeah ranja is a southern thing so i 'm not totally aware if all the ins and outs . 
  in american `` euro '' sounds fancy and exotic , while in europe `` euro '' sounds commercial . 
  that 's part of the reason why the eurodisney name got changed . 
  same . 
  a 20 minute ride from the airport into town ? 
  oh i thought it was just us . 
  if you 're a tourist and you want to get drugs banned in this so-called drugs paradise , this is the way to do it . 
   were n't on the fucking bike lane , the bikes were in the wrong place mind providing the google link ? 
  here we had a comedian [ make fun of ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=midsdyln_88 ) drinkers of an [ alcohol-free beer brand ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/buckler ) by heineken . 
  sales dropped and they finally withrew it from the dutch market . 
  it 's improving though . 
  the renewed public spaces are very nice and it has very varied and ` strange ' architecture from a non-dutch perspective . 
  if news channels follow them , it spreads easily . 
  i noticed that with the term ` social media ' [ soshul meedeea ] . 
  the dutch equivalent of that is . . wait for it . . ` sociale media ' [ sosyal-uh maydeea ] . 
  so it 's one syllable and letter more , but because one news channel started saying this ( probably because it 's hip ) instead of sociale media , everybody else followed . 
  i love this . 
  i need this . 
  there 's an [ abundance ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3hhtq1/some_places_in_the_netherlands_you_could_visit/ ) of [ towns ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/koppelpoort_amersfoort_2008.jpg ) that [ barely get any foreign tourists ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3flrtr/visited_amersfoort_the_netherlands_yesterday_a/ ) . 
  also rotterdam and utrecht are catching on , so if you want to see it before they get tourist crowds , you should visit soon . 
  [ already have ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/529myz/does_your_country_have_a_goodville_ie_a/d7ji35e ) . 
   it might just be my bias . 
  definitely . 
   2 hours away from the nearest other major cities ( amsterdam and utrecht ) arnhem , zwolle and the entirity of friesland are now crying . 
  haarlem would qualify . 
  also , french is * very * vowel specific . 
  pronounce ` est ' wrong and it could sound like ` et ' or ` ouest ' , totally changing the meaning . 
  they 're actually [ banned ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/26/disney-bans-selfie-stick-theme-park ) in disneyland paris , fyi . 
  in other places you can use them , unless there 's signs specifically banning them . 
  you 'll look stupid though .

  it 's alright . 
  i 'm so canal . 
  i do n't actually like kroketten that much . 
  shocker . 
  we simply learned this in english class . 
  but then it was n't mentioned much afterwards , we just roll with it or are n't very aware of it i guess . 
  we do have word orders that change the meaning of a sentence in dutch , but we do n't have the very strict order based on word categories . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  dc subway is notoriously bad these days because of a funding and maintenance issue . 
  transit can be pretty sucky even in the ` big cities ' like boston , philadelphia and los angeles . 
  only chicago and nyc qualify as world-class transportation imho . 
  for a country with that many big cities , that 's pretty sad . 
   public transit is good in the big cities a bus every 15 minutes is considered super frequent in many cities there . 
  here it 's off-peak average . 
  we have several bins ; blue - paper and cardboard green - organic waste black/grey - mixed waste and we hang plastic bags ( which can be collected for free at some distribution points throughout the municipality ) with recyclable plastic materials ( mostly packaging/containers ) to [ hooks on lamp posts ] ( http://www.tubantia.nl/polopoly_fs/1.2309326.1350642714!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_800_600/image-2309326.jpg ) on the street . 
  there 's been talk about providing bins for those , but many people would n't have the space for 4 bins , and the plastic recycling program is currently very much optional . 
  we go trough so many plastic that we usually have a full bag laying around in the garage while the next one is filling up . 
  before this system , we had one large bin [ with separators inside ] ( http://www.omroepflevoland.nl/sitefiles/temp/665c45e68963697d171d08f678c5e9f6-360x200.jpeg ) for mixed and organic waste . 
  they would get separated in ( to ) the garbage truck . 
  for paper , glass and batteries you had to go to [ communal containers ] ( https://rtva.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/grof-huishoudelijk-afval-bij-ondergrondse-containers-1132x670.jpg ) that are spread out throughout the neighbourhood . 
  they 're still around . 
  some of them have clothing donation ones too . 
  for the bigger stuff you can go to the municipal waste point ( aka the stuff on the picture was put there ' illegally ' ) . 
  banking infrastructure , archaic voting system , extreme conservatism ( dangerously so ) and legislating against self interest , lack of transportation options , mediocre existing infrastructure ( more lanes does n't always equal efficiency or better solution ) . 
  equal nation ? 
  well your influence in the world is much larger . 
  but yes , infrastructurally , socio-economically and politically you are quite a bit behind in many regards . 
  that 's a bridge . 
  something more resembling a [ fiets-o-duct ] ( https://aseasyasridingabike.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/screen-shot-2014-04-13-at-19-44-45.png ) . 
  we have so many to choose from . 
  [ one ] ( http://thehostelgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/rijksmuseum-amsterdam-10-sz-1024x681.jpg ) , [ two ] ( http://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tunnel-1.jpg ) , [ three ] ( http://www.ipvdelft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bicycle_bridge_haarlem_buitenrust_ipvdelft_mg_2457b-1500x630.jpg ) , [ four ] ( https://www.loketgezondleven.nl/interventies/i-database/bijlage/21443/tunnel%20a15%201%20na.jpg ) , [ five ] ( https://aseasyasridingabike.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/screen-shot-2014-04-13-at-19-44-45.png ) , [ six1 ] ( http://www.nio.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/back-1280-ned03-3.jpg ) [ six2 ] ( http://www.nio.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dscn53442.jpg ) , [ seven ] ( http://www.zja.nl/image/2016/4/5/a4_delft_schiedam_zja_2.jpg%28%29%2849b11e71c4e41cc0886e7d33522551e7%29.jpg ) , [ eight ] ( http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/static.panoramio.com/photos/original/5360564.jpg ) . 
  and if you 're suddenly start feeling like [ overpass ] ( http://e89pfle.cloudimg.io/s/cdn/x/http://www.platformruimteenlicht.nl/static/site/img/module/content/companyaccount/59/images/244.png?modified=1399993351 ) . 
  i hoped you laughed in his face . 
  yep , practically making them useless sometimes . 
  cars also park in them , and the sidewalks are crowded and too cluttered as is . 
  all kinds of signs . 
  big signs , small signs , huge signs , nice signs , the best signs . 
  i often see people on the station who have no clue whats going on because they refuse to read the [ sign ] ( http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5313/5905989414_2c5a53457d_b.jpg ) . 
  they wil look at their tickets , guidebook , maps , but wo n't simply look up . 
  yeah there 's barely any ladders in the canals . 
  and getting on to the boats ( if there are any ) is very difficult , even moreso when it 's nearly freezing outside . 
  do n't take a leak in the canals when drunk , preferably do n't do it at all . 
  several tourists die every year . 
  also , read the damn signs and be aware of the social customs by simply looking around and see what other people do . 
  you should see nyc . 
  it 's not like we only have 3 cities you know .
