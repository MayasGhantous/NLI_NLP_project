  well not that ` big ' , but definitely usable as a family car . 
  well there are a lot of words that are easily translated , appel-apfel , peper-pfeffer , zon-sonne , those kind of things . 
  but there are also * a lot * of [ false cognates ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/lijst_van_valse_vrienden#duits ) . 
  zee/see and meer/meer come to mind as the most famous example . 
  elaborate please , 
  does n't fit the `` doe normaal '' thing we do . 
  does n't sound too bad . 
  could be shortened to just statesian for colloquial use . 
  have you never been to dubai ? 
  or have you never read my post  most hotels, 
  not really no . 
   and a lot of times , camping is more expensive than hotels but i 'm guessing that 's the mega campings which have literally everything . 
  most hotels do n't even come close to the number of on-site facilities and activities . 
  they 're a godsend for families with children . 
  with campers and caravans you have ; familiarity , freedom , practicality . 
  why rely on some snobby hotel owners with shitty staff if you can easily do away with all the fluff and their rules and just be yourself in your own homely environment . 
  the basic recipe for dutch caravans is  40 y.o. 
  couple + likes sunny climates ( + likes nature ) + favors practicality over dressing up at night and pretending to be fancy . 
  there 's been an explosion in camper sales recently too because of the post-wii baby boomers who have reached retirement age . 
  acces denied then . 
   wooden warships do you still have [ any left ] ( https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/ng-mc-239 ) ? 
  very imposing . 
  meanwhile our king has so many important names that one etcetera just wo n't do . 
   even the introductory text pretty much standard across the world  * * the secretary of state of the united states of america hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit the citizen/national of the united states named herein to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of need to give all lawful aid and protection . 
  * * * in the name of his majesty the king of the netherlands , prince of orange-nassau , etc.etc.etc. , the minister of foreign affairs requests all authorities of friendly powers to allow the bearer of the present passport to pass freely without let or hindrance and to afford the bearer every assistance and protection which may be necessary . 
  it was in the news recently that we are keeping cars longer than we used to , because of improved reliability and efficiency . 
  so it 's very common to see the latest models of cars as well as early 2000s . 
  if you ever need a film location for a dystopian anarchy flick , i know just the place . 
  principally i ca n't be for it because it 's not * your country * you 're voting for . 
  for it to be your country you need to apply for citizenship which has some requirements that foreigners have to fulfill first , to show that you 're serious about it and know the rules and circumstances of the place . 
  it 's only fair . 
  especially since you can already vote in local elections as a non-citizen . 
   i 'm ok with it when people just go to church or prey heh, 
  thinking we speak deutsch or are german is considered worse ( wonder how that could be ) than mistake us for danish . 
  they both happen frequently enough . 
  americans . 
  do n't consider us germans . 
  looking forward to the 2124 olympics already . 
  that way a bigger percentage of earth could get on our level of awesomeness . 
   we used to have a rather secular society ummm , no we did n't ? 
  we were liberal , but have never been more secular than the last 20 years . 
   begging on public transport . 
  begging anywhere . 
  levi 's . 
  you should check out [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4xgjy3/who_are_the_singersrappersbands_from_your_country/d6g2sxa ) . 
  [ not saying what you mean . 
  ] ( http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luhn1biucp1qbbhtyo1_500.jpg ), 
  people have it at home because many people have adjustable beds . 
   \u00e0 la carte wow so exotic . 
  supposedly tongue is the best tasting part of a cow . 
  look for `` gouda holland '' then . 
  we should have more . 
  [ they 're hilarious ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usshhxk21ds ) . 
  pretty much all dutch towns and cities redo an entire street every 30 years . 
  when this happens the utility cables and sewer get renewed and the most recent standards of street design are applied ( they have changed those about 3 or 4 times in the previous century ) . 
  we do that because we like nice streets , but also because our soil consists of peat or sand that 's literally sinking . 
  that is the reason why the standard for all sidewalks is concrete pavers instead of asphalt or concrete like many places in germany , belgium and the uk have . 
  with pavers it 's easier to fill holes , remove protruding tree branches or do utility works without making a big mess when resurfacing . 
  in the cities there 's pleennttty of gum on the ground . 
  cigarette buds too . 
  the rests get periodically cleaned by cleaning crews . 
  we 're pretty good at doing maintenance . 
  the dutch do n't like messiness and we expect our government to keep things clean and in order . 
  that 's what we 're paying them for after all . 
  what the actual fuck . 
  while we 're not all nudists , nudity is still less frowned upon here . 
  there 've been uncensored nude people [ on tv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jrk9vjcjpk ) here many times . 
  just today i was walking on the beach and saw somebody changing , without towels or anything . 
  shelterting your childred from seeing some titties or a weewee just is less of a thing here . 
   europe news and politics - r/the _ europe donald trump - r/the _ donald nigel farage - r/the _ farage geert wilders - r/the _ wilders norbert hofer - r/the _ hofer oh god . 
  hs2 is getting built though . 
  it gets even weirder when a lot of big manifestiations are in your capital city but your government is n't even located there . 
   why do * german * tourists do * making holes in the beach to sit in * ? 
  this explains so much , thanks !, 
  `` let me put something american in there so i can relate . '', 
  it sure keeps the news entertaining . 
  but at this point these kind of things do n't faze me anymore . 
  admit it , america is whack . 
  even if he uses trains with reserved seats ?

  maybe a ford or cadillac ? 
  probably not even there . 
  we use socialism when talking about actual socialism . 
  however , words that derive from it get used most often when talking about [ socialist parties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_party ) . 
  many of these used to be actual socialist , but have now adopted social-democratic principles , albeit more extreme than the ` regular ' social-democratic parties . 
  when speaking to americans , we tend to adopt their lingo to make communication easier . 
  it 's just one of many different us political terms ( like liberals actually oppose government intervention and pretty much all americans are actually both democrat and republican ) . 
  it has a following and people will have heard of it but it is not mainstream popular . 
  by the way , have you considered canada ? 
  if so , why not there ? 
  we in western europe are very self-focused , and of course there was the eastern and western divide . 
  so there had been less interest in that area for quite a while since you were far away and you were part of `` them '' , not `` us '' . 
  since so many `` eastern european '' countries have joined the eu we get to hear a lot more about you , and we might even take a holiday there now . 
  not that long ago when you said `` europe '' you meant western europe , eventhough you know that the eastern part is also technically part of it . 
  for many people this still holds true though . 
  that 's why it feels like `` new europe '' eventhough it 's been right there for as long as we can remember . 
  i actually had no idea about that . 
  i just made it up because it conveys how we see those countries . 
   dutch is just a terrible , ugly sounding language . 
  hate this clich\u00e9 .
