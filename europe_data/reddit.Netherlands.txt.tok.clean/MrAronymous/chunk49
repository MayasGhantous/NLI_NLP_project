  the brazilians love it . 
  it 's ` poor ' , the women are hot , cheap workers , more corruption , socially less progressive , ` new europe ' . 
  ireland is the definition of laid back . 
  i think portugal or southern spain might also qualify but do n't hold me to that . 
  that 's an awful lot of assertions . 
  there 's great demand for them too . 
  jobs guaranteed !, 
   he would easily beat hilldawg no he would n't . 
  plus even if he got half of the democrat vote , that would leave the country 25 % bernie , 25 % hillary and 50 % trump ( sort of ) . 
  bernie has half a brain , that 's why he 's backing hillary . 
  when hillary is elected we can all go back to feeling and spreading the bern and making sure candidates like trump never happen again . 
  to op : even if trump ever comes to power , you have to realize that living in a country is more than the politics alone . 
  sure the usa has its problems but it also has things you 've grown incredibly accustomed to . 
  remember that pretty much * everything * is different here . 
  the bare minimum before even considering actually moving is spending two weeks here first , to see what it 's like . 
  and by that i mean explore more than the touristy bits , talk to people , ask for their opinions . 
  moving here might be a long and tiring process , so you have to be really sure and determined to pull through ok , otherwise you wo n't get happy here . 
  also : / r/iwantout, 
  no atemlos ? 
  yes let 's take it all as litteral as possible and ignore the point completely . 
  [ denmark of course .

  it 's true though , on reddit at least . 
  a lot of americans confuse etnicity with culture . 
  i do n't think he is . 
  i think he 's even holding back , because otherwise he would be too extreme ( r ) for americans . 
  do n't really know them tbh . 
  but feel free to make a post of your own .

  this is what many people consider the only good dutch language band to currently exist .

  i 'm missing some really good ones but ca n't come up with the names , damnit . 
  aminata ( lt ) , annie ( no ) , aqua ( dk ) , gr\u00e9gory lemarchal ( fr ) , indochine ( fr ) , j\u00f3nsi ( is ) , kenza farah ( fr ) , lorie ( fr ) , m83 ( fr ) , parov stelar ( at ) , robyn ( se ) , yelle ( fr ) i still need to add so many artists from this thread to my library . 
  used to have many more , which i picked up from foreign vacations . 
  you need to be more specific . 
  what is diversity to you ? 
  is it language ? 
  because i 'm sure a lot of people speak different languages in my country everyday too . 
  i liked it better when it was netherlandic . 
  average joe ? 
  does n't give a shit . 
  average mohammed ? 
  gives a shit . 
  jewish people sometimes get shouted at by ` youths ' . 
  some people are afraid to wear a kippah or hang some sort of traditional jewish thing next to your door and if you raise an israeli flag you will of course get harrassed . 
  it 's only incidents now , but i can imagine a lot of harrassment goes unreported and it 's worse than an outsider would think . 
  amsterdam has had a very large jewish community since the 16th century , since we were the most liberal and keep-to-yourself tolerant place in europe . 
  during wwii the numbers have greatly been deminished , while numbers of muslims kept rising from the 70s onwards . 
  `` fortunately '' the jewish and muslim communities are quite a distance away from each other , but plenty of confrontations do happen ( usually coming from one side . . ) . 
  that 's the case for amsterdam at least . 
  if you go to a smaller city or town ( aka places where there are less muslims ) and as long as you 're not bothering anyone nobody will bat an eye . 
   getting it reconfigured to meet european laws is a pain in the arse in my country it 's not that big of a deal . 
  it 's just expensive . 
  surprisingly american blinkers are accepted on imports ( no idea why ) and you only have to make sure you have seperate brake lights ( who does n't nowadays ) and have a rear fog light installed ( if you have a car that 's also sold in europe you only have to rewire it ) . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.hollandexpatcenter.com/cms_file.php?fromdb=467 ) summarizing what you just said . 
   the surface stays hot and is indicated either with `` h '' as very hot or `` h '' for hot and takes some time to cool down that 's not [ induction ] ( http://theinductionsite.com/graphics/top4.jpg ) is it .

   lads holiday to amsterdam uuugggghhhh, 
  i had this one in a buffet restaurant . 
  it looked so good . 
  so delicious . 
  i thought it was some sort of pudding thing , bread-thing , pastry-thing with chocolatey sauce . 
  i was wrong . 
  i did not have a good time . 
  frikandelpizza . 
  italy does have some weird plugs though . 
  it 's like the regular plugs almost fit , but they do n't . 
  i managed to get my charger in , but it needed support to not fall out . 
  there 's a menu on the website . 
  might be interesting for americans : images of the suspect in the courtroom are not allowed ( only if it 's [ newsworthy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f4tloj3cke ) ) , so [ artwork ] ( http://nos.nl/data/image/2015/04/20/150908/864x486.jpg ) gets made instead . 
  also only the family name initial is usually released and if the tv stations want to show a picture of the suspect they [ get barred ] ( http://nos.nl/data/image/2015/02/25/135484/864x486.jpg ) . 
  sure !, 
  where can i send you the bill . 
  i 'm actually really curious about a proper american bbq because of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwkouxf-dso ) . 
  unlimited bread sticks !, 
  we recently got our first papa john 's !, 
  but on a serious note , we do have [ an american restaurant ] ( http://pendergast.nl/ ) opened up by a kansas city guy . 
  they do american dishes and ( real ) barbecue and stuff . 
  have n't been yet . 
  no such thing . 
  schools focus on learning , tests . 
  there might be some sort of fesitivities on some occasions , a once a year school play , expositions , school-organized events , but nothing that major . 
  schools do n't have mascots ( because why would we ) , and nicknames are usually born out of `` contempt '' , by the other schools . 
  so the only `` school pride '' we have going on is liking your own school better than the another ones , because [ insert non-science based subjective trivial reason ] . 
  i guess almdudler from austria . 
  well the difference starts at the school systems . 
  see , here , schools are for studying and learning . 
  from books and such . 
  it 's been that way from the start . 
  of course there might be gym classes or sports courses , but not as extensively as in the us . 
  we practice sports in local sports clubs . 
  same goes for most of the other extra-curricular activities . 
  at my school we did have some sports in which we participated in regionally and if you got through , nationally , but that was limited to field hockey and soccer . 
  it was only 1 team , once a year , for fun , nothing serious . 
  in some ways , it is definitely very weird how you guys mix sports ( especially very competitive sports ) with college . 
  stories of people not getting good grades but being helped by the school to magically fix the grades so they can keep playing for the school team ?
