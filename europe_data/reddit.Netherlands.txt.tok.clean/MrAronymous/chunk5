  wow . 
  i tried to be reasonable , but it 's clear now that you 're either just a teenager , . . or braindead . 
   you just had to force it i had to explicitly mention it you mean ? 
  yeah , i did that considering it to be useful extra information , but aparantly you do n't believe it . 
   try to insult me um , how exactly ? 
  pointing out that you 're saying something pretty silly is n't trying to insult you . 
  it 's trying to point out your errors , be it in a rude way . 
  gosh . 
   like you all know just how right i am . 
  why . . what . . how ? 
  this does n't even make sense . 
  look ; i 'd say i 'm in the middle of the spectrum . 
  i ( like to think i ) form my opinions on the most pragmatic solutions and answers . 
  when something is wrong , i will adress it and not beat around the bush . 
  i , for example , do n't believe letting thousands of immigrants ( not yet even talking about refugees ) more into europe is going to be a great success . 
  there is no political , social and financial will in europe to make that succeed . 
  also i think there are other reasons why it would n't be a good idea ( overcrowding/population density in certain areas ) . 
  so i think there needs to come a solution so that the ( mass ) immigration stops/declines . 
  that does n't make me racist , rightwinger or dishonest . 
  and if you think just because i do not think the same as you on this issue makes me some sort of spawn of evil , well , then i 'd say youre somewhat dillusional . 
  judging from your posts it seems like you 're in your little bubble , and everything that does n't fit ( agrees with ) in your little bubble is bad and should go fuck itself . 
  you should be more open-minded . 
   racist propaganda seriously now . 
  do you not even know how stupid you sound ? 
  i 'm not even a rightwinger or racist . 
  never thought of hilversum as a city . 
  merely a town . 
  ca n't they make ceuta and melilla outermost regions or overseas territories , so different immigration laws could apply ? 
  well i tried . 
  well it 's all part of the `` it 's our land '' thing . 
  no doubt russia would have said something dickish if they `` stopped providing services . . to your own land ?!, 
  obviously this is must be not your land then '' . 
  [ not really . 
  ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/012/132/thatsthejoke.jpg ), 
   smullers lol hell no . 
  what have you been smoking . 
  this alone tells me you never visit either mcd/bk or smullers . 
  smullers fries are undercooked and almost look * belgian * . 
  patties taste cheap , even the packaging feels cheapo compared to mcd . 
  and then how you mention something about suprior price and quality and then even dare to mention starbucks positively in the next sentence ? 
  do you even remember [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lor35ddcqbc ) ? 
  compared to any other building in rotterdam that one even looks a little plain lol . 
   vergissmeinnicht does n't that literally mean forget-mine-not ? 
  forget-me-notty . 
   the renewed utrecht central station has opened . 
  this has been so overblown . 
  first of all , the station has never closed . 
  secondly , they are building the new station in sections , so some parts were already renewed , some parts were n't . 
  the building is n't even finished yet . 
  that 's why there also has n't been a reopening ceremony . 
  it 's just that a big new part , 2 sections , have opened at the same time . 
  to complete the whole station it will take until 2016 . 
  what the area [ actually ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000urn1qd3eaci/s/900/900/sms-20140409-0233-nia3.jpg ) , [ looks like ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/matthijs_borghgraef/5193144148/in/dateposted-public/lightbox/ ) . 
  ( anticipate minor expectation letdown ), 
  i do n't know what hotel they `` booked '' and how many people they accounted for . 
  but if you stay at the disneyland hotel and get tickets to the 2 parks , yeah , it can easily cost that much . 
  this was on the news here last week . 
  the news programme calculated that for the same weekend of disneyland paris ( i guess a hotel stay too ) , the french paid around $ 1700 , the dutch $ 2300 and the british $ 3600 . 
  that 's crazy . 
  and the only way to get the french price you saw online is by calling a french call centre you found on the french-language website . 
  norwegian men , yes . 
  in uniform , oh yes . 
  [ here 's a transavia jet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nio38kxye-i ) making an emergency landing yesterday . 
  it could n't land at rotterdam because of the wind and it did n't have enough fuel left to deviate to brussels . 
  spoiled fits the description . 
  this fish is so raw if you 'd tickle it it 'd orgasm and scream `` je jouis '' . 
  that seems somewhat counterproductive in a way . 
  they think the uk is paradise . 
   leaving no room for expansion for cycle ways . 
   let me rephrase that for you  they 're not our priority, 
  a dutcho-germanian thing . 
  he is n't referring to etnicities though . . eastern europe is a loose term that could include basically any country from hungary/czech republic eastwards . 
  it 's about governmental ineptitude . 
  london . 
  eventhough it might look perfect at first glance , i as a dutch person already see so many things wrong with it . 
  that 's not racism . 
  nah , we just [ fill it with greenhouses ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/westland/@51.9950804,4.2218731,9555m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c5b7d4aa3838df:0x31ee3d1de87f506e ) . 
  [ night version ] ( http://blogs.esa.int/andre-kuipers/wp-content/blogs.dir/9/files/logboek/336_1781.jpg ) ( in bright yellow ), 
  [ for those who do n't know what he 's talking about . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2km9tbcj148 ), 
  the local name is statia anyway . 
  could n't find anything on them on wikipedia . 
  is li\u00e8ge not part of belgium ? 
  not comparable though . 
  alemans and saxons basically do n't exist anymore . 
  hollanders , brabanders and limburgers do . 
  to give you a better comparison , it would be like calling every german a bavarian . 
  that 's different from what you just said . 
  the randstad is for the biggest part in holland . 
  so the characteristics they link to the randstad , automatically also belong ( for a great part ) to holland . 
  but sure , it 's a pars-pro-toto , and limburgians and frisians * especially * should hate those . 
  [ hmmm ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/grootneerlandisme ), 
  it 's not that crazy . 
  they have their own local identity you know . 
  can i just be an annoying know-it-all and declare in this psa that the article ( `` the '' ) does n't always need to be in the name ? 
  seeing lists of countries '' ... namibia , nepal , the netherlands , new caledonia ... '' annoy me . 
  you will never see `` the philippines '' or `` the united states '' in those lists . 
  also the article should n't be capitalised when it 's not at the beginning of a sentence . 
  it 's not `` the president of the united states ... '' so it should n't be `` the netherlands '' either . 
  thanks so much .
