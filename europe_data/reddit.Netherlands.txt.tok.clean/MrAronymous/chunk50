  insane . 
  then there 's [ things like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px8bxh3sjn0 ) which raises some eyebrows . 
  i heard they have nice skies there . 
  serious answer ; new england . 
  politics there seem level-headed . 
  i also dislike the ultra car dependence of the south and west , so older towns seem a better fit . 
  i also like the closeness of several important east coast and canadian cities . 
  the latest europop hits . 
  [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4mkp3c/how_do_you_view_your_hate_speech_laws/ ) is a nice read . 
   a complicated massage but i 'd love one someday . 
  `` youre pretty stupid , no offence '' really now ? 
  anyway , it could just be a teenager . 
  in any case theyre trying to learn , ca n't fault that . 
  have all taxes been automated yet ? 
   andouille liar . 
  it 's not even tasty . 
  that 's a local variety though . 
  fries with satay sauce , mayonaise and onions . 
   no id for voting . 
  how . . do you vote then ? 
  or at least how do the people at the polling station verify that it 's you whose name is on the voting card ? 
  germany : better environment-related regulations and subsidies . 
   le lyc\u00e9e americaine le notable exeption , 
  more like socially progressive and economically conservative ; government has not business telling people what to do , who to marry and the government should interfere with the free market economy as little as possible . 
  ok here we go .

  well citizenship is very clearly defined . 
  take the oath , sign the documents , get a passport and there you go . 
  however , becoming a real * dutchman * , * german * , * briton * , * greek * , etc. 
  requires a bit more work . 
  i consider anybody who shows affection for the dutch society and our way of life welcome . 
  if you want to become a dutchman however , language is a must . 
  it 's necessary to understand ( the deeper meaning of ) us better . 
  it also will make * participating in society * a whole lot easier . 
  by the time one fully understands dutch most of the people who have made such effort will have already participated in local customs , traditions and cultural celebrations , so that box can be ticked as well . 
  done . 
  it 's 2016 . 
  most people are educated , people in the tourist industry will know basic english pretty much anywhere . 
  pick a destination based on what you want to see . 
  and the bigger the culture shock the more you 'll learn . 
  because rio only starts next week you silly . 
  many do the abraham and sarah thing here too . 
  but we buy the cardboard road signs in stores . 
   it is usually always . 
  awkies when you 're a tokkie and [ the prime-minister uses the word tokkie ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2016/06/prime-minister-pledges-to-stop-calling-people-tokkies/ ) . 
  aso/tokkie refers to behavior , pleb and pauper refer to inferiority partly based on social status . 
  in dutch we use aso for anybody who is doing something `` asociaal '' . 
  putting your trash out just after trash day ? 
  loud music in the middle of the night ? 
  somebody cutting you off in traffic ? 
  yet you would n't put that on signs in public . 
  you would say restroom ( whatever that is ) or washroom . 
  also never toilet . 
  well the nordics do have some hot blonds . 
  but i keep being attracted to all these german guys . 
  with no doubt infrastructure and maintenance thereof . 
  basically thinking ahead . 
  patties from the supermarket ( which 99 % of people would buy ) are just ... not the same . 
  do you still do it ? 
  you think * that * looks ugly while we have [ this ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@51.9012015,4.459611,3a,54.5y,63.97h,97.48t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssvaifx7my7achpgvttdxyq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) ?

  at least it looks well-kept . 
   then everybody should start from the same point . 
  triggered . 
  nfc , yes . 
  a large percentage uses nfc-machines for contactless payments . 
  if contactless with your phone would work would depend on if samsung or apple have deals with the banks . 
  that 's a downside of living outside of the us ; pretty much every digital google/apple/other service is made available later or even not at all , eventhough we might be better prepared for it infrastructure-wise . 
  it all depends on where you live . 
  some ggds do std tests for free . 
  before we had provinces we had small duchies , kingdoms and all that kind of jazz . 
  they grew bigger to about the size of the current provinces , or even bigger . 
  the provinces [ united themselves federally ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_republic ) and became quite succesfull ( semi-empire and all that ) . 
  flash forward and some provinces were cut in half ( brabant , limburg ) when belgium said smell ya later and we became a kingdom ( again ) . 
  so now we have : ** the kingdom of the netherlands ** : this is a sovereign state which consists of 4 countries ; the netherlands , aruba , cura\u00e7ao , sint-maarten . 
  the king is the head of state . 
  they all have parliaments and their own laws , taxes , police forces . 
  the kingdom ( * het rijk * ) takes care of things like defense , coast guard and customs . 
  they also levy several kinds of taxes ( vat , income tax , vehicle tax , etc. ) . 
  ** the country of the netherlands ** : this is a country within the kingdom ( just like the other 3 ) . 
  in this country there are 12 provinces which are represented in the states-general ( parliament ) . 
  this consists of first chamber and second chamber ( house of representatives and senate ) where laws are made and approved . 
  ** public bodies and 12 provinces ** : - next to the 3 island countries in the caribbean , there 's 3 more islands . 
  they 're not countries but overseas territories ; `` public bodies '' . 
  they do not belong to any province but are part of the country of the netherlands nonetheless . 
  that 's why the highest point of my country is n't the vaalserberg , but mount scenery instead . 
  they have local taxes and some more powers than a regular municipality would . 
  - the provinces have their own councils ( `` states-provincial '' ) . 
  they decide on things on an interregional level and build interregional infrastructure . 
  they also elect senate members . 
  they are financed by the national government and bring in money with vehicle taxes and assets . 
  so while they have a function , it 's not major . 
  provinces are still the way they are because of socio-cultural reasons imho . 
  they more or less correspond to regional identities and cultures . 
  there have been talks of merging provinces for efficiency reasons . 
  ** municipalities ** : on the local level there are municipalities . 
  they all have their own taxes and councils with elected members . 
  ** water boards ** : being the * nether * lands , we 've had our struggle with water . 
  that 's why we 've had our water boards since long before our current form of government existed . 
  these make sure the water infrastructure stays sound .
