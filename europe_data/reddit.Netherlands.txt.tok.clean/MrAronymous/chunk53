  if they 'd truly hate the usa they would never ( let someboy ) pay for them to go there on exchange . 
  but have n't you heard about the anti-american circle jerk on reddit ? 
  well to be honest it 's all about context . 
  were they talking about wanting to burn a us flag ? 
  were they talking about it happening in the middle east some years ago ? 
  were they asking you what the reponse would be if they did it during their stay ? 
  you ca n't really say they hate the us if you do n't know what they really were saying or aiming for . 
  just talking about what theoretically could happen does n't mean they want to do it , you could even go as far as saying they were doing cultural exploration by asking or proposing something about the flag which the usa is so obsessed about ( though i do n't deem that likely ) . 
  if you take offense to that , then well , that 's you americanism shining through . 
  politics and government issues in the us are a giant fucking shitshow . 
  but i think the aversion of anything government is older than that . 
  for a country claiming to be so free , have justice and equality for all , they sure seem to hate the things that basically make that a country could be that way ; government . 
  there 's this idea that there 's `` we the people '' versus `` the government '' ( on which you can blame everything . ) . 
  reality is , they could n't work without each other . 
  this idea of course also exists in other countries , but i found it to be more pronounced in the us . 
  we were poor farmers !, 
  also do n't forget kwark . 
  only the dutch/german versions are remotely edible as dessert . 
  also circling your index finger in front of your temple means `` he 's crazy '' . 
  and why would you put up that third one , which is more southern european if you ask me , when we have a uniquely dutch one !, 
  [ waving to the side of one 's head means ` hhmmm/yummy '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usatd7czqu8 ) . 
  as for the netherlands : living in a city it 's no problem to be an american . 
  you dress similar , act similar and most of us speak english . 
  however , if you do n't learn dutch you will feel excluded over time . 
  and maybe the hardest part of all is making dutch friends . 
  social circles are very tightly knit and it may be hard to make friends , because the dutch tend to make friends early on in life and stick with them . 
  then there 's the cultural differences . 
  there 's * a lot * more than you think . 
  www.stuffdutchpeoplelike.com covers the basics ( take 'em with a grain of salt ) . 
  if you put in serious effort though , there wo n't be anyone denying you becoming part of society or even gaining dutch nationality . 
  construction differences too . 
  mediteranean architecture is the way it is because of the weather and local materials . 
  having solid/well insulated/white walls help a lot . 
  my dad sometimes uses flemish voices though . 
  just because it 's fun . 
  see . 
  fluent already . 
  why so sour . 
  definitely use the search feature on the local subs / u/sir333 mentioned . 
  well there really is no place like home . 
  but i guess denmark could qualify . 
  i could continue riding my bike , see flat landscape , have a good quality of life , danish is somewhat easy to learn . 
  also important to note : big box stores at the outskirts of town were banned here in the 70s . 
  so you will barely find any large stores at the outskirts of town . 
  all the neighbourhoods ( especially newer ones ) have all the basics ; supermarket , hairdressers , local doctors , primary schools , etc. 
  in a central location . 
  usually in/around a small local shopping center . 
  you will find parking spots there , of course . 
  in the city there 's a way bigger chance you do n't . 
  of course we do have * some * big box stores , but they 're usually for gardening , furnishing or construction . 
  add to that that our suburbs are fairly dense and thought out in a masterplan beforehand makes riding bikes very easy . 
  mcdonald 's  mac, 
  how old are your friends ? 
  if they 're younger good chance some simple red solo cups will blow their mind . 
  or anything other that they 've seen on tv and never had in real life . 
  or think something that might not be local to your area but is american nonetheless . 
  something wild west , deep south , college party , sports weekend , nature wonder , foodstuff , barbecue-related ? 
  ca n't really think of any more examples at the moment though . 
  it 's the 3rd biggest city in france , but it 's not promoted as well ( = less touristy ) as other cities so chances are you as an american might have never heard of it . 
  i 've heard it 's highly underrated and has a beautiful historic old town center . 
  it 's also pretty close to the alps . 
  please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  a few years ago it has been legalised to run tv and web ads ( i think ) . 
  that did n't used to be the case , there was only broadcast time on public television and room for election posters on big billboards [ like these ] ( https://nlkiest.nl/image/xxl/2014/02/26/verkiezingsbord-gemeenteraadsverkiezingen-2014.jpg ) that are put up for every election and some leaflets being given away by campaign teams or some newspaper ads . 
  now unsurprisingly i 've only seen the commercials on tv and internet for the parties that usually are considered to have the richest ( when it comes to wages ) voting base ; d66 and vvd . 
  i 'm not sure if i 'm liking it , and i sure as hell hope it does n't go crazy like all the american election ads . 
  disgraceful . 
  how about our king on a bicycle ? 
  there is an ` american face ' though . 
  guess because of the mixed racial gene pool . 
  just like there 's a british face and slavic face . 
  never ever heard of it . 
  no , we get the classic stuff like early civilizations , roman empire , middle ages , colonisation , world trade & empire , french revolution , dutch revolt , american indepencende , industrialisation , wwi , wwii , cold war , vietnam war , etc. 
  as well . 
  but besides that , or rather after that , we also get taught the skills / r/nymerius mentioned . 
  yep . 
  too much of a hassle for me personally though . 
  well , when in ~ ~ rome ~ ~ europe . . as for driving : * we have 2 types of pedestrian crossings , the zebra crossing is where you have to yield . 
  * bikes . 
  bikes everywhere . 
  * for the love of god , do not drive through central amsterdam , or any other town for that matter . 
  park ( well ) outside the city center . 
  * [ really do * not * go over the speed limit or do anything other than driving while driving ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/netherlands/comments/1unsp2/driving_a_car_in_the_netherlands_are_the_speeding/ ) * learn what ` shark teeth ' mean and look like , it will be a life saver . 
  * read the entire manual i posted elsewhere in this thread . 
  * no really the bikes are everywhere . 
  for more town specific or travel info you could use the search engine filter in / r/thenetherlands, 
  nice little car !, 
  the sandero is a budget car here ( eventhough the renault version might be better specced than the dacia ) and you 'd have a less nice experience . 
   paris - paris of france oh dang , you win . 
  that looks a lot like paris . 
  fucking barry atsma . 
  english is n't superior , but it 's more useful in an international setting , or when someone does n't speak dutch that well . 
  dutch people have selective pride . 
  football , down-to-earth-ness and pragmatism are something to be proud of here . 
  the language , dutch music and film industry are n't ( though that also has to do with the quality , but it 's a chicken and egg story ) . 
  i 'm not sure what point you 're trying to make . 
  sounds lame but it 's very important : learn the road rules , especially the priority stuff will be very different from what you 're used to , as are the vienna convention road signs which will be vital in city traffic . 
  if you do n't obey the priority rules ( right traffic has right of way , bikes and pedestrians might have the right of way , etc. ), 
  you could land in some very deep shit .
