  not sure what that has to do with limburg , lol . 
  but yes , i know , sint maarten is a different country , so there you would show your passport . 
  the bes islands is what we were talking about though . 
  they 're islands on a different continent , but belong to the country of the netherlands . 
  so say there would be direct flights to those islands , big chance it would count as domestic , and therefore you would n't need a passport . 
  but of course those countries are non-schengen , and immigration laws might require you to identify yourself ( passport ) . 
  so no one really knows as of now . 
  good luck landing an intercontinental airliner [ here ] ( http://www.magellanjets.com/hs-fs/hub/66565/file-1571137412-jpg/saba-landing-strip-juancho-e.-yrausquin-airport.jpg ) . 
   saba and sint eustatius are reached by smaller planes from saint martin or other nearby islands . 
  bonaire is reached via cura\u00e7ao . 
  the name `` the netherlands '' is primarily used for the country of the netherlands . 
  as far as i know , when you want to mention the kingdom , you should always specify it by saying the word kingdom ; the kingdom of the netherlands . 
  so the netherlands does n't share a land border . 
  belgium 's in the way . 
  the kingdom of the netherlands , however , does . 
  i 'm sure there 's people with different perspectives on it though , it 's not set in stone . 
  so to answer your question : as far as i 'm concerned ; no . 
  that 's why you do n't see netherlands antilles on the diagram anymore ; it has been dissolved in 2010 . 
  it 's not like there 's any difference apart from the name though . 
  if there would be direct flights , it would probably count as domestic . 
  but seeing as there are n't , you 'd always need a passport . 
   saint martin oh boy that island is a mess . 
  ( `` an island so nice they named it thrice '' ) . 
  in dutch the name of the island is sint maarten ( without the hyphen , going against spelling rules ) . 
  that 's also the name of the dutch part . 
  the french part is called sint-maarten . 
  in french the 3 things are all just called saint-martin . 
  in english the island is called saint martin , the french part saint-martin and the dutch part sint maarten . 
  funny thing is , it 's probably named after the city of geldern , which is now in germany . 
  it 's the same with limburg being named after limburg , or limbourg , which is in belgium nowadays . 
  aruba holy shiit . 
  our version of santa clause ( st. nicholas ) supposedly lives in spain . 
  nobody knows why . 
  but the threat used to be that his helpers would take the children in the bag which carries the gifts and take them back to spain if they did n't behave . 
  pretty sure our government flip-flops on anything these days , so i would n't be too sure about anything . 
  what kind of drugs are you on . 
  `` do n't join nato out of fear of us attacking , or we will attack you ! '', 
  beating us ? 
  must be nordic . 
  if you 'd propose that now , you 'd get even more resistance and backlash than when you 'd propose it in ` good times ' . 
  very bad idea ( to begin with imho ) . 
   someone shot in it shat . 
  they gave a shot at shitting in it so now it has been shat in . 
  the definition of the word ` genocide ' includes the word ` systematic ' ( * `` the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group '' * ) , as in puting up a system so many can be killed more easily . 
  so therefore not sure if those crimes you mention are genocide or not . 
  i do n't know the whole background story of those colonial famines/slaughters/deaths though , but it could be that the numbers ` just ' added up , and not that they were trying to eradicate them systematically . 
  it 's a tricky word . 
   pluralism is good . 
  how dare you . 
  my narrative is the only good narrative !, 
  i wonder , would taping aluminium foil over your windows help any ? 
  i do hope action has been taken , but i 'm afraid i can already assume different . 
  i propose to you the [ * plan river split * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tny7tlk.jpg ) . 
  it 's only fair . 
  use [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=nl&amp;tl=no&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.reddit.com%2fr%2fthenetherlands%2fcomments%2f36cwm6%2fthe_us_wants_to_carry_out_passport_checks_at%2f&amp;edit-text= ) instead and read it , in stead of listening to op 's denigrating bullshit . 
  not visa , but [ esta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electronic_system_for_travel_authorization ) . 
  still costs money and time . 
   russia was n't considered as threat to whom ? 
  would you still want to live with your abusive ex after a break up ? 
  or would you leave and reach out to someone else to protect you , even just in case ? 
   nato moved towards russia . 
  countries who do n't like russian ruling and occupation joined nato . 
  nato did n't ask the countries to join , it 's the other way around . 
  you can look it up , it 's everywhere on the internet . 
  but of course everything not fitting your mindset must be some western propoganda . 
  sad . 
  oh lord who said russians do n't have humor . 
  yeah but i 'm not sure if most europeans see it that way anyway . 
  not if it 's meant as an insult . 
  that 's really cool . 
  definitely do n't spend it !, 
  ^ in ^ the ^ eurozone, 
  does that make kosovo a little bit of shit still stuck to its tail ? 
  * i 'm a strong independent biking dutchie who do n't need no mountains . 
  was talking about the last part of your sentence . 
  does n't even matter if the numbers are high or not , my point still stands . 
  well i have n't even looked up the numbers but i can already say that 's crap . 
  hollywood panders to the american audience . 
  because if it 's not going to be relatable or patriotic , who 's gon na watch ? 
  fuck me for telling you guys something you did n't know yet right . 
  low-end upper-class , yes . 
  that 's the way it works in lots of western european countries . 
  speaking of lul , i recently learned that originally it 's supposed to be the word for blowpipe of a bagpipe . 
  not 100 % sure if it 's true though . 
  that is n't the point he was making though . 
  right to marry vs. living with crazy people . 
  does n't sound like a difficult choice when you put it like that . 
  i 'm still convinced you anglos need to rename countries to ` netherland ' and ` czechia ' . 
  makes so much more sense . 
   think we believe we are literally citizens of that country . 
  because that 's the way lots of people act . 
  seriously . 
   things would have been slightly different growing up . 
  trivial things , like how you adress your grandparents , what kind of food you eat at dinner . 
  but even those are generalizations . 
  because we have those diffences in other western countries as well ( within the same ` cultural group ' , so to say )  nobody i know thinks st. patrick 's day is a big deal in ireland i think you do n't know enough americans then . 
   there is a good chance you have a slightly different upbringing and culture i think this is way overblown . 
  i 'm going to leave you with [ this post ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/30lhuf/serious_nonamericans_of_reddit_what_do_you/cptqm7u ) , that i think sums it up quite nicely . 
  nothing wrong with having ancestry , but it 's annoying when you say and think you litterely * are * currently still part of that ethnicity/culture , when , in most cases , they 're not . 
  they only celebrate a few - americanized - holidays and that 's it .
