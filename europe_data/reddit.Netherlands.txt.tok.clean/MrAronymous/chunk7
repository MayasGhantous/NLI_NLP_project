  it 's like . . you 're not part of it , you seem to know awful little about it , because you 're * not * , you 're . . american . 
  ( despite what some people believe , americans do have a culture . ), 
  and * with that comes with the ` american orders irish car bomb in ireland because its his favorite drink because it 's irish ' type of stories . 
  * van * beethoven my dutch hart crie evrytime . 
  no one 's stopping you from using a bucket instead . 
  it 's aimed at a gay audience . 
  quite fitting haha . 
  so can anybody tell me whats wrong with it exactly ? 
  i only knew of some fire safety regulations not being ok , but that would n't take 9 years to fix would it ? 
  loved the design so i 'm a bit sad to see it fail so massively . 
  no , but germans literally dig holes to sit in . 
  in amsterdam most new buildings actually include * both * social housing and market priced housing . 
  this not only prevents rich vs. poor neighbourhoods , it 's also an incentive to make the building not look super ugly and poor quality , since half of the building must actually be sold to people . 
  the king does n't choose anyone to rule . 
  they candidates basically have to propose it themselves , usually in a coalition . 
   erdogan also gave forms whut . 
  was it organized by the turkish government or by some dutch-turkish organizations ? 
   while in the netherlands nope . 
  she tweeted stuff in turkey . 
  sounder * , as in `` sounding like '' ** vowel **, 
  de telegraaf usually has the same kind of cartoons , just not on the front page . 
  all foreign news sites tend to do that for all places in the netherlands . 
  `` keukenhof in amsterdam '' , `` meppel , 57 miles northeast of amsterdam '' , `` eindhoven , a two hour drive from amsterdam , . . '' . 
  such a pointless statement . 
  so first you 're appropriating greek culture and now you 've imported the holi festival ? 
  y' all got some nerve . 
  our trains can barely even cope as is !, 
  does that sound incredible to you ? 
  sound pretty plausible to me . 
  there was much apathy towards the brussels and paris attacks here . 
  phrases like `` they should have killed more '' , `` i do n't care about it '' were coined in tv interviews with muslim/foreign/whatever youths . 
  we just never talk about scotland . 
  because we 'd have to do it in french , german , spanish , italian , etc. 
  ew i did n't even realise how ugly that looks in german . 
  it looks so magical in other languages . 
  if we can call you england . 
  they are n't mutually exclusive . 
  our name does n't make sense anymore though . 
  netherland is the real deal . 
  blame the english . 
  only for stupid people though . 
  if you had to have to take stupid people in to account for * every * thing you do , there would be little progress . 
  is n't this a failure of representation then ? 
  is n't this what parties are supposed to ; listen to the problems of the people and propose solutions/legislation ? 
  unless the parties are n't currently doing that , i do n't see any value added . 
  not that i 'm against it . 
  yes . 
  at least i think it was nyc . 
  it was a large important us city . 
  ca n't seem to find the article anymore , but it basically boils down to the fact that some of your streets utilities have n't been replaced since the 1930 's . 
  sure . 
  point out that one questionable source ( it is n't even * that * questionable , just biased ) , and ignore the other 6 sources . 
  i could put up many more , but i think i 've already made clear that by now it is a fact that america has an infrastructure problem . 
  that 's why you hear it time and time again on tv and in the news . 
  but still there are few political breakthroughs while time is ticking . 
  crumbling infrastructure is not a myth . 
  * http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/ * https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/2016/03/30/fba8ae0a-f688-11e5-9804-537defcc3cf6_story.html * https://realtruth.org/articles/100709-002-americas.html * http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21605932-country-where-everyone-drives-america-has-shoddy-roads-bridging-gap * http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/us/politics/human-cost-rises-as-old-bridges-dams-and-roads-go-unrepaired.html * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpzvaqypav8 seems like the world bank report is about the presence of infrastructure , not so much on the quality of it . 
  another example is that in nyc there 's still wooden water pipes . 
  in the netherlands a street and utilities get entirely replaced every 30 years or so . 
  building new stuff is one thing , actually maintaining it is another . 
  and just because you ca n't see it ( potholes , cracks ) , does n't mean it 's not there . 
  in many ( african ) cultures the left hand is used to wipe your butt , while the right one is used for eating . 
  idk . 
  you could n't make this shit up if you tried . 
  but usa did it t !! . . 
   eritrea not war regugees , human rights refugees ( dictatorship and all that ) . 
   parts of syria which ones ? 
  can you really compare it to ukraine though ? 
  i 'd say it 's a totally different situation . 
   morroco , pakistan i do n't think anyone is arguing the morrocans or pakistanis should be considered refugees . . 
  because western ukraine is still functioning . 
  ^ is n't ^ it ? 
  the west has no spine i tell ya . 
  was n't it an eu directive ? 
  just like basically any other public infrastructure that they want to be privatised . 
  case in point : everything was going great ( relatively/except critisism of russian gay policies ) until the ukrainian shit and russian interference shit started happening . 
  right after fucking sochi . 
  you had a nice event and some good press , and you had to fuck it up a few months later . 
  if that had n't happened there would be no boycots , there would be less hatred towards russia , etc. 
  usa did it too !, 
  but the photo is from baarle-hertog !, 
  did n't know it was that widespread . 
  thought it was only germany and some other countries . 
   while holocaust denial is not explicitly illegal in the netherlands , the courts consider it a form of spreading hatred and therefore an offence . 
  so * technically * we should n't be on the map , since the courts ' opinion can change overnight . 
   most of europe source/proof ? 
  but hey , consider this : the glass actually gets replaced here . 
  in many other parts of the world they do n't even bother maintaining the shelters at all . 
  surely it must be explained in one of the other 14 stanza 's , 
  germany . 
  so not germania or germanic things . 
  the silly thing is the song is a mix mash of words from different time periods . 
  i mean , keep it as it was or translate but the current style is just silly imho . 
  i 'd much rather have them keep the old lyrics . 
  here 's the first stanza . 
  i marked the words that are n't properly translated or old fashioned in bold . 
  there was , but the difference was smaller . 
  but yes , it 's important to keep in mind that there was no concept of ` germany ' being a single nation . 
  then why do they also support going the opposite direction of what attaturk preached ? 
  seems weird .
