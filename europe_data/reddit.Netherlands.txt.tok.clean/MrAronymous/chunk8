  if you 'd just answer his main question instead of argue about some triviality , we could all go home earlier . 
  made them get a hobby . 
  what does that have to do with if they 're a terrorist organization or not ? 
  i 'm sure there were people waving ira and eta flags too . 
  when i say latin i mean latin-american . 
  i 'd say it 's western geopolitically but not culturally (  latin ) . 
  ok , fair enough . 
  cruyff is his international name . 
  there 's a reason why he used it himself in his foundation , brand and social media names . 
   while the waiting times are rather long this can be said of all of france . 
   the waiting times for the carrefour i used to go to sometime , oh my god . 
  and the cashier * always * had to deal with someone handing in coupons so it would take twice as long . 
  not exactly . 
  when written , i and j are simply connected , and it looks like a y with dots on it . 
  a capital y an ij look the same when written down in cursive . 
  when typewriters came about they had a special ij key , that 's why elderly who do n't know any better start typing y instead of ij on their computers . 
  in school when learning the alphabet we call y/y * ij * , but consider it an y-grec or * griekse ij * . 
  so eventhough y is the 25th letter in our alphabet and would never replace it with normal ij , we pronounce it as ij but consider it to be a letter in its own regard . 
  to make it even more confusing , school posters sometimes [ mix it up a little ] ( http://merlettes.noventa.nl/upload/cache/c328e7da1205d1dc01e6d0d5c165d02b.jpg ) . 
  most people have no problem using and differentiating the two in daily life though . 
  really ? 
  because lidl wins time and time again ( i believe 5 times in a row ) in surveys when it comes to fruit and vegetable quality here in the nederlands . 
  not really . 
  one could argue that they 're afraid more will becoming and `` their country is already full [ of them ] '' . 
  i bet it 's easier to understand afrikaans than say , west-vlaams or maastrichts , which are just `` accents '' . 
   t t, 
  sorry about that . 
  that 's just brabant being weird again . 
  according to the current rules it should be koninklijke luchtvaartmaatschappij . 
  love it . 
  lmao that 's hilariously sad . 
  on the photo . 
  the other side of the platform usually is busier though . 
   netherlands are opening huge new embassies are we ? 
  ca n't find anything on it . 
   poland 's intro [  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpmb1ilj9oi ), 
  the new vrt on-screen graphics remind me way too much of rtl nieuws . 
  really now . . 
  you guys need some good marketing efforts . 
  do n't forget ibiza . 
  doubt there are any migrants going there . 
  is n't 2 guys holding hands in the middle east considered normal , a friendship thing ? 
  it 's not like he 's stating a fact . 
  it 's one of a few plausible options . 
  you 're forgetting venezuela . 
  lmao that sound bite is awful . 
  [ try this one ] ( https://translate.google.fr/#en/fr/valley ) . 
  sounds very similar , but i think most french people would pronounce it with less of an y sound at the end . 
  wikipedia says it should be either * delling * or * fallei * in frisian . 
  i thought she jumped out of a window on damrak ? 
  but it makes so much sense !, 
  i do n't know why you 'd write schiff + fahrt as schiffahrt . 
  to be honest though , they 're not all chavs . 
  plenty of ` normal ' people act like how he described as well . 
  i 'll let you speak for me , because you obviously know for sure that we 're not getting information from 2 sides , because that would suck right , * jamieusa * . 
  next time be less full of shit . 
  corrupt police and corrupt court system . 
  i personally believe that both stem from the fact that police chef and judges are elected positions . 
  you should watch the [ john oliver segment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pol7l-uk3i8 ) if you do n't know what i 'm talking about . 
  edit : oh you were being facetious , oops . 
  yes . 
  and half of them are wanted british criminals because they like our freedom here . 
  yes were living the eussr dream . 
  ( but no thats not what happened actually , eventhough you 'd might think that from reading the comments here ), 
  police in the us are soo much less authoritarian . 
  you 'd have a great time . . 
  we 're a police state now got it . 
  i will notify everyone else , thanks for letting us know . 
  woop , got me . 
  not really tho . 
  dutch police are actually nice and well behaved people . 
  look , even i am surprised about what 's happening and do n't approve of this weird move by the mayor and the police . 
  but ( as always ? ), 
  the comments on / r/europe are so over the top and dramatized it 's not even funny . 
  i 'm not even a lefty if that 's what you 're trying to imply , so a bit less of that condescending bullshit that would be great . 
   government forces with the authority to put you in the dungeon , entering your home asking you ` to take back what you said ' , seems pretty threatening to me . 
  you 're doing a great job of distorting the context and reality . 
  americans are great at dramatizing everything after all . 
  - no dungeon - ` entering your home ' . 
  or was it ` being let inside to have a conversation ' ? 
  context is key . 
  - ` take back what you said ' . 
  your words . 
  they were being told to calm down and not to incite riots ( aka keeping public order ) . 
  if they said something punishable by law ( inciting violence , hate , etc. ), 
  then they could have been prosecuted . 
  again , i do n't think these actions were actually necessary in the first place , and i 'm sure some questions will be raised by politicians after this incident , but you 're overreacting . 
   to threaten no . 
  can i just take a minute of everbody 's time here and * klaag * about how i hate it when people capitalize the t in ` the netherlands ' . 
  you will never see anyone writing ` citizens of the united states ' or ` the people of the philippines ' , yet ` the netherlands ' seems to be logical ? 
  sounds fairytale-like . 
  so do people in ni ever have * gb * on their license plates ? 
  or * i * , * ni * ? 
  only seen the ij in belgium or in texts written by people who do n't know proper grammar and spelling . 
  johan cruijff , ruud van nistelrooij and dirk kuijt use y 's instead of ij 's for foreign speakers . 
  rotterdam 's feijenoord football club even officially changed their name to feyenoord . 
  does n't make a difference when it pronouncing it , just makes it seem more old fashioned ( they used to be all y 's back in the day ) . 
  it 's true and it needs to stop . 
  why does this anti fascist action sound so fascist ? 
  anecdotally , indians make for a shitty it employees .
