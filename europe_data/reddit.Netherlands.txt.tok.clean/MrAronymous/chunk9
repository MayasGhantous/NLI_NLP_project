  i 'm not even calling you names . 
  because we do n't cater to braindead people . 
  if you hear ` volgende halte ' right before every stop is announced , you will figure out it means ` next stop ' . 
  if you do n't , you 're stupid , and you 'll get my sympathies . 
  still , amsterdam announces stations just plainly by just saying the name . 
  what on earth is there to translate ? 
  when they started calling us dutch there was n't ( at least to the english ) a very clear distinction between the low countries ( be+nl+lux ) and germany . 
  it was basically a word used for ` those germanic people on the other side of the north sea ' , but after a while became the word for the people of the low countries * only * , which i believe already was called `` the netherlands '' back then ( including [ parts of ] belgium ! ) . 
  then when netherlandic duchies and counties united themselves ( the northern part , currently nl ) they started using the same name for that country , wheras in dutch we made up new names : `` nederland '' , `` nederlanders '' . 
  in dutch `` nederlanden '' and `` diets '' are historic terms now . 
  `` nederlanden '' only refers to be+nl+lux in a somewhat historical sense . 
   cheapest stuff lol , you silly foreigner . 
  nah , it 's just normal asphalt , like they would use on normal roads , but they add some colouring to make it red . 
  we use red or pink for most bike paths , sometimes just black as well . 
  i think you might like [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eae4kozzqog ) . 
  even in the netherlands , europe 's bike capital , these ` highways ' are a fairly new invention .

  `` a bit yeah . 
  try the other one . '', 
  would n't be seen as rude and boorish , it would be seen as helpful . 
  by saying that , you would have helped her get better results . 
  we 're usually * very * direct when we think something could use improvement , 'cause we figure if we do n't beat around the bush an approvement can be made and the person will be better off in the end . 
  no , it 's a factual term . 
  it 's just how you describe ( d ) black people . 
  even now it 's not considered offensive by everyone , but some people do take offense . 
  personally i believe it 's mostly because ` neger ' sounds like it 's the dutch version of ` nigger ' , which we all know is not very . . nice to say to someone . 
  but because there is n't a similar term for white people ( have never heard a dutch equivalent of the word `` caucasian '' ) , since we 're by far the majority , it creates an odd situation . 
  i 'll just repeat what has been said in the dutch thread on this : the titles ( eventhough usually it 's about the small summary underneath the title ) were most likely added by the rijksmuseum itself in the 19th and 20th century . 
  if the works themselves have official titles with ` offensive ' stuff in it i imagine they would n't have to be changed , since it 's part of the painting itself and gives an insight into the views of that time . 
  do you go to the museum to get an insight into the views of the people who made up the titles in let 's say 1889 ? 
  or are you going there for the paintings from the 17th century . 
  that 's the deal basically . 
  a river is not necessary for a dike to exist . . 
  but yeah , we have plenty of highways on dikes already . 
  it 's just that there is demand for a second highway between the rotterdam area and the tha hague/delft area . 
  putting it on a dike here would cause even more ` visual pollution ' than on ground level . 
  they 've constructed a friggin land tunnel . 
  compesation enough if you ask me . 
  fields of grass , or even manmade [ polders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polder ) , are considered nature here . 
  we barely have any `` real '' un-man-made nature left , if any . 
  delfland is n't part of groene hart though , lol . 
  most old photos of european cities are like this . 
  i imagine tourism was n't really that much of a thing yet , cars certainly were n't , and people were much more likely to do their shopping and going out closer to their home than we would now ( going to city centers ) . 
  should 've built some new courts then . 
  i see a moose in there . 
  you win . 
  is that its only use ? 
  we get quite a lot of british tv shows concerning moving homes , building homes and redecorating homes . 
  when they 're touring around the house and get to a room you always hear the people saying `` oh this is lovely '' when they 're often beyond ugly cramped hellholes . 
  most of the ` average/normal ' town homes look cramped anyway . 
  ( seen a lot of traditional 2-room gound floor layout , where in the netherlands any variation of the [ doorzonwoning ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/doorzonwoning ) is by far the most popular type ), 
  this made me lol . 
  that 's the case of integration vs. assimilation . 
  what are you , a flag fetishist ? 
  or just a secret american ? 
  [ that 's what they were used for previously ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyzkx6qgtny ) ; to show where on the train it was busy or not , using sensors in the trains . 
  this station was a test case . 
  please just sign up for that course . 
  the problem is that brussels does n't have an effective government . 
  the city of brussels ca n't do many things because the boroughs ( which are officially municipalities of their own , i believe ? ), 
  block things constantly . 
  hear hear . 
  let 's start with urban planning , traffic , etc. 
  you have got to be kidding me . 
  i think there 's quite a bit of nuance lost in te transalation of the title . 
  the title says ` we do n't have [ . . ] molenbeek under control ' . 
  quite a bit different from ` lost control ' , no ? 
  honest question : will this mean that front national will win the next elections ? 
   still easily came to france better yet , they have been most likely born there . 
  there 's also a unique dutch keyboard , but it 's not used . 
  it has the \u0133 ( < seperate letter ) on it , and a different layout . 
  my dad 's american multinational corporation thought it would make sense to put dutch keyboards laptops , when ordering them for their employees . 
  he works in ict and 90 % of his working environment is in english , and everybody in nl is used to the qwerty us int . 
  layout anyway . 
  so stupid . 
  i laughed like a retarded seal at this . 
   i do remember one article saying how the local supermarket does n't have a woman behind the counter anymore because the men would n't hand her money . 
  why are we throwing away our moral principles again ? 
   cooperation with the eu and possible membership . 
  where do you get this from ? 
  that stage has passed a decade ago . 
  erdogan is still in power , but is known for his stances on conservatism , religion and ` patriotism ' . 
  combine that with the euro and fincancial mess and it becomes clear they obviously do n't want to join the eu . 
  not entirely unreasonable . 
  in a refugee center in the netherlands scabies has spread . 
   wilkommenskultur ooh new word of the year, 
  yes there is . 
  belgian dutch is dutch the way they speak it in belgium . 
  as simple as that . 
  just like there is australian english and austrian german . 
  i always wonder how successfull these protest are , considering that the government is seated in the hague and it 's saturday today . 
  hijacking this thread to show you guys [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqnxudfg9lm ) . 
  too good to not be shared . 
  protest , yes . 
  assault , no . 
  flanders can not into countryside . 
  they should turn back on the electric fence ( which they switched off because it might kill people that try to get across - what was the point anyway ? 
  lol ) and translate the warning signs into more languages . 
  i mean there 's a limit in how far you can go until you need to leave people to their own responsibilities and common sense . 
  it is marketed to belgians .
