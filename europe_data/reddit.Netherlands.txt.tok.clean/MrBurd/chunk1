sorry , is n't my native language . 
  thought the meaning was about the same : /, 
  context : every ceramic poppy ( of which there are about 888.000 ) represents a war casualty . 
  they 're hand crafted , too : v more info : http://poppies.hrp.org.uk/about-the-installation, 
  i once saw three ( ! ), 
  waterspouts just off the coast of northern schiermonnikoog . 
  i left the beach as soon as i could because obviously swimming during a storm is n't a particularly good idea . 
  still fairly amazing to see . 
  eatin ' the salmiakki until you start to smell like household ammonia :d, 
  this . 
  first off , an espresso machine can only brew one cup at a time . 
  second , you can put as much coffee in the filter as you like . 
  and if you 're like me you put as much coffee in as you can to get the blackest cup possible . 
  from personal experience , drinking stupid amounts of coffee on a daily basis eventually makes you hallucinate sounds . 
  hearing drum solos in the middle of the night is n't normal . 
  on stupid doses of coffee it is . 
  also : more coffee , beer , snow , lots of metal bands and a funny language . 
  let 's see . 
  one mug of coffee for breakfast , one when arriving at work/school , one during the break , one more during work/school afterwards , one more when home and 1-2 more in the evening . 
  6 + cups a day is normal ( for me : v ), 
  i 'm on two as well . 
  my cup is essentially a vase with a handle and fits like 500 ml . 
  yep . 
  bike lanes that are part of the road are kinda creepy , even over here . 
  creating separate bike lanes in already existing cities is obviously very costly , so it 'd be nice if there were newly built neighborhoods designed around cycling or something like it . 
  this is what happened when my smallish town was designed . 
  there 's bike lanes all over the place which allows cyclists to quickly get from one neighborhood to the other , while cars ca n't even get near the lanes most of the time . 
  instead , cars need to exit the neighborhood and ride around the town to get to other neigborhoods . 
  very safe . 
  if you 're interested : https://www.google.com/maps/@52.0332496,5.1586862,708m/data=!3m1!1e3!5m1!1e3 green lines are bike lanes . 
   i 've heard horror stories about trying to navigate through all the bikes ... 
  if you 've rode a bike since the age of six , you 'll know how to handle dutch cyclists . 
  if you 're a tourist , i can imagine that 's terrifying . 
  i cycle about 8 miles to school every day ( which is in the somewhat busy city of utrecht ) and you 'd not believe how many cyclists there are that do n't seem to have the slightest idea how traffic rules work . 
  i do n't see the answer ... : c, 
  not completely related , but something that ticks me off is the durability of modern consumer appliances . 
  buy a coffee machine , which breaks just after warranty voids . . what to do now ? 
  as an amateur repairman i 'd open it up , but nowadays appliances are stuck together with glue , specialty screws and other things that make it extremely hard to open a device without breaking it . 
  so you bin the device and buy a new one . 
  waste of perfectly good material while it probably was a broken fuse or exploded capacitor that could be fixed if i could open the device a bit easier . 
  either make devices of a higher quality , or make them so technically skilled users can have a look inside and fix the things . 
  the tallest structure in the netherlands is technically a mast as well because that 's it 's purpose . 
  oh , and it 's also the world 's largest christmas ` tree ' during the winter months . 
  the red color of this table makes it look like i 'm in a martian sandstorm or something . 
  netherlands , i am disappoint . 
  look at the voting results for urk if you want a good laugh ... that 's madness . 
  you 're forgetting / u/frisiandude : /, 
  nice song , indeed . 
  if you 'd come up with lordi again i 'd still vote . 
  we suck & we know it . 
  russia going mad and taking over things . 
  and the things that are being overtook not able to fight back adequately . 
  netherlands : * excluding the netherlands from lists  :(, 
  i. ... do n't get it . 
  ehm ... flowers ? 
  i think it involves enough alcohol to forget those things exist . . 
  the wet spot in the pants at picture # 2 & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  i like how it says ` het gekkenhuis ' at the bottom , which is dutch for `` madhouse '' :p, 
  ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ i 'd ^ ^ ^ rather ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ russian ^ ^ ^ gas ^ ^ ^ than ^ ^ ^ german ^ ^ ^ gas . . ^ ^ ^ : c, 
  did n't know germany was so close to lithuania , though . . not to mention poland somehow occupying belarus . . 
  over here in the netherlands our policewoman all appear to be stereotypical lesbians . 
  i feel your pain . 
  i play tetris every day while on the toilet . 
  there 's a small table with a drawer in there that contains the usual toilet supplies , and an old gameboy color with tetris and batteries that never seem to run out . 
  that said , on those gameboys i play at light speed . 
  great , point cap is at 5100 . 
  fun . 
  yoghurt is way more manly . 
  bonus points for roosvicee . 
  4,0 ... nope . 
  ` talking about the police ' ! = ` beledigen/doodsverwensingen ' wat dit artikel nam . 
  the article obviously means the average dutchman and not that one asshole making comments . 
  something tells me that donald duck has done this before ( much like that one time with salvaging sunken ships by filling it with ping-pong balls ) . 
  edit : the thunderbirds [ did it as well ] ( http://thunderbirds.wikia.com/wiki/lord_parker's_'oliday ) . 
  it 's a synonym for both the animal thing and people thing . 
  your claim needs sources . 
  i especially like [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jkfvelq.jpg ) . 
  ** netherlands ** * teacher sending sexually oriented text messages to students * more bullshit about zwarte piet * king willem alexander visited putin in the kremlin * a jet fighter [ accidentally shot the command tower ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/570973-f16-beschiet-toren-vlieland.html ) instead of the target during a training mission . 
  * [ man kills 3-year old daughter and himself and shoots ex-wife in the leg ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/572179-reuver-gebeurtenissen-op-een-rij.html ) . 
  * tour de france 2015 will start in utrecht ( yay ! ), 
  * that same city got a new mayor * 89-year old woman was instructed to leave the train because she had n't paid . 
  she got six minutes to do so but could n't do that and had to wait for the next train . 
  * more discussions about a pill that should make women horny, 
  average ? 
  average ? 
  say that again and i 'll stick a bicycle up your bum . 
  yup : c, 
  pff , where i live there 's more bike lanes than car roads . 
  the metal band does n't sound that bad . 
  but hey , it 's finnish metal , after all . . 
  dropwater !, 
  i like how after enormous doses of salmiak-based liquorice you are pretty much exhaling ammonia gas . 
  * the average distance between highway exits is 1.6 kilometres or one mile . 
  * the dutch socialize by complaining about things * we 're tolerant as fuck * groningen might as well be a small village in uzbekistan ; nobody ever goes there and it 's pretty much never ever mentioned in the news . 
  stupid , stupid greenhouses . 
  if you drive around amsterdam and the neighboring farmland at night there 's bright orange spots on the clouds everywhere which indicate greenhouses below . 
  cheaper alcohol in general . 
  plenty of wind here without those mountains ... 
  the active dutch reactor is a research reactor ( tu delft ) , is n't it ? 
  not an official anthem ( not sure , think it was used though ) but ` finlandia ' by sibelius .
