this is actually a church and the martinitoren of the martinichurch in groningen is what ? 
  not a church ? 
  not of a capital ? 
  what is your point exactly ? 
  note that it says '' % of natural gas ** derived ** from russian natural gas '' . 
  so maybe the gas imported from nl , norway etc might originate from russia after all . 
  i know that nl imports a lot of russian gas to pump it right out to germany amongst others ... 
  note that in nl , the pregnancy/delivery leave is paid . 
  parental leave ( 26 weeks ** per parent ** by the way ) is not . 
  it just means your employer needs to grant you the right to work less for a period after which he needs to employ you for 100 % again when parental leave finishes . 
  this picture gives a bit distorted idea because the distance-scale ( x ) is about 33 times the heigth ( y ) scale . 
  in nl your are not allowed to laugh on you identity card/passport photo ... 
  [ netherlands reporting in !, 
   i can understand why you connect death almost obsessively , if i may , with guns . 
  i just do n't see why you do n't connect death with knives , bows , other weapons that cause and caused many deaths . 
  i guess because you do n't hear about it in the news ? 
  thanks for some new insights . 
  i admit i am a bit obsessive about it . 
  guns just scare the shit out of me . . 
  i ca n't explain very well why . 
  it has something to do with the overwhelming potential of death it possesses , much more than the other weapons you mentioned . 
  absolutely true . 
  but is the comparison really equal ? 
  but the problem lies with that little tiny fraction of idiots that do use guns to inflict indiscriminate suffering to others , just because they ca n't handle their life or issues . 
  i understand that this is not fair to the nice enthousiasts , but does your hobby outweigh the tragedies ? 
   it 's very common amongst the antigun and progressive movement . 
  maybe because they are a little bit right ? 
  everyone with gun is a potential murderer , in the sense that they are much more than with most other objects . 
  that 's because a gun is a very good tool to do murdering . 
  a nutcase with a car or knife can also kill , yes , but not with the efficiency of a gun . 
  human beings are not rock-solid stable mental beings . 
  they can `` lose it '' at some point in their life under influence of all kinds of events in their life . 
  a couple of years ago a shopping mall shooter here in nl killed several people in a blind frenzy - he had military stuff from the shooting club and had all licenses . 
  he had those licenses for years but lost it in the meantime . 
  so while you and most others are very sensible and nice people that like guns for other reasons than being killing machines , there are nasty people that do n't . 
  let 's say they ruin everything for you . 
  i realize now that * i * connect death and suffering to guns and you do n't . 
  probably because i do n't share the hobby and do n't see/understand how you can enjoy a gun while detaching from the original purpose of the gun . 
  ( you do agree that the original purpose is to inflict damage ? ), 
  why am i fucked up exactly ? 
  you are certainly not sounding like an ass unlike some others . 
  thank you . 
  with an airgun i mean the one which shoots those little lead things . 
  they hurt but wo n't even penetrate your skin . 
  they are not illegal in a country like ours where guns normally are . 
  i guess its what you call `` target rifles '' . 
  they are designed for shooting at paper targets . 
  they are not designed for killing , right ? 
  ok , i 'm open for better understanding . 
  i ca n't deny i 'm getting emotional and that is never a good guide . 
  please explain to me why people are fascinated by weapons and how that plays out in shooting at paper targets . 
  is n't some of the admiration for , let say , a machine-gun the power it gives over other people or the potential killing it could do and the properties it possesses to excel at that ? 
  a gun is not your average hobby-object . 
  its a weapon . 
  its designed and build for hurting/killing other ( human ) beings . 
  now you can use it in a different way and shoot at practice-targets for points , but that does n't change its original purpose . 
  why do n't they throw darts or use an air-gun or sports-crossbow or other not-designed for killing shooter if it 's about projectile delivery sports ? 
  no , it has to be the killing-type , ( i.e. 
  real weapon . ), 
  right ? 
  i 'm sure there are very normal and friendly people that would n't hurt a fly and somehow get exited about a military gun , but i feel they have n't thought their interest through and do n't see a gun for what it really is and represents . 
  to me guns are devices from hell . 
  actually , new insights are that it was a very slender tornado that travelled exactly over the nave of the church , which is why that part collapsed and the other buildings in the domsquare were hardly damaged at all . 
  the transept ( also witout those braces ) , the choir , the tower with its wooden hood and the trees and many houses around the square were all just fine . 
  also a lot of churches in nl had the same construction as the roof of the nave of the domchurch and were all on the general path of the tornado and had no big damage , which indicates that the construction was not so weak at all . 
  source : [ new book about the church and tower from rene de kam . 
  its an artifact in the map caused by how the borders are drawn .

   the eu has 500 million people in it . 
  more than the us yes , but our healthcare system is n't an eu one . 
  it 's per country . 
  and smaller countries with 20 million people are more homogenous than very big countries with 300 million people and country-wide legislation is just easier in the smaller country because people differ less . 
   each state in the us can decide on itself to implement a healthcare system like we have . 
  i do n't know much about that , but what is obamacare about then ? 
  it 's country wide and it 's a pain to implement from what i understand . 
  i do n't understand your argument 2 and 4 . 
  this was about the video being `` retarded '' or not . 
  i agree with most of what you say , and i do n't think the size difference is a complete explanation of the differences between the healthcare systems , i just think you are overreacting on the retardeness and flaws of the video . 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't get it . 
  what 's so retarded about this video ? 
  the video says that america is a different type of country that has many many more inhabitants than the european countries and therefore state-issues have different challenges . 
  how is that a retarded idea ? 
  you might not agree or think it does n't apply to health care . 
  it 's debatable . 
  but retarded ? 
  `` west-frisia '' ? 
  really ? 
  yes ... 1300 years ago, 
  from wikipedia : `` in all cases , the term diaspora carries a sense of displacement ; that is , the population so described finds itself for whatever reason separated from its national territory , and usually its people have a hope , or at least a desire , to return to their homeland at some point , if the `` homeland '' still exists in any meaningful sense . '', 
  do you feel displaced ? 
  then why is my very normal question downvoted into oblivion ?

  diaspora has negative connotations , whether you like it or nor . 
  it 's different than saying `` immigrants '' . 
  well , that 's what i mean . 
  the fact that my very normal question gets downvoted into oblivion proves my point i think . 
  yes , i know what it means . 
  i was wondering why he uses it for japanese in canada , or for turks in europe . 
  disapora has a lot of negative connotations . 
  why do you use the word diaspora ?
