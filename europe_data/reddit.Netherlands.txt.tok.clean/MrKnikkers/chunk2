  [ the daf 600 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wsx4vqi.jpg ) ( and follow up models through the 60 's and 70 's ), 
  italy 2 . 
  greece 3 . 
  portugal least : every coin with the head of a monarch on them . 
  i 'm so disappointed they put our new king 's head on the coins when beatrix left . 
  i thought the nsa had everything already ? 
  yes , its fine . 
  i just wanted to convey that in many explanations it 's said that `` haag '' , although initially the hedge itself , it came to refer to the entire woods/hunting ground of the count that was enclosed by the hedge . 
  oh damn , i was worried already that i missed some sophisticated reference ... 
  i 'm sorry , you will have to explain it :-(, 
  i did . 
  utrecht : `` outside the crossing '' , more accurate would be `` downstream of the crossing '' rotterdam : `` borrowing water dam '' ? 
  it 's literally `` dam by the river rotte '' . 
  not sure where that `` borrowing '' is coming from . 
  same applies to amsterdam : dam by the river amstel groningen could mean green meadow , but this is far from sure , its thought that its more likely that it relates to a tribe or familyname that regarded a person named `` gruno '' as their ancestor . 
  edit : and den haag , the hague , in old dutch it had the meaning of `` woods '' or `` hunting grounds '' in stead of hedge . 
  so `` the count 's hunting woods '' or something like that would be more accurate . 
  but it 's about domestic football leagues . 
  so a large country also has more cities with more clubs in the leagues with more stadiums , the stadium-cap argument does n't hold imho . 
  i 've noticed this farmville link in other ( serious ) media as well . 
  am i right that they just reported cows that did not exist , someone called that `` virtual cows '' and then someone said `` haha like they had cows on farmville '' and that came in the news ... 
  but it has absolutely nothing to do with farmville . 
  ok , fair enough , but then please explain how you define `` the dutch '' , `` holland '' , `` dutch people '' when you use that in your sentences . 
  are you talking about me ? 
  [ ok , i 'm ready !, 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-d4zw7j-d08w/t43dpczi2ai/aaaaaaaaa-i/-mm4uo51sfy/s180/michael-jackson-popcorn.gif ), 
  please , stop seeing the complete population of a country as one homogeneous group in which everyone defines his/her views based on television , newspaper and internet media that is driven by sensational messaging . 
   someone finance minister dijsselbloem managed to frame the downgrade by s&p as support for the government 's policy . 
  maybe it 's because dijsselbloem , as opposed to you , actually read the [ report from s&p ] ( http://www.standardandpoors.com/spf/upload/ratings_emea/thenetherlands.pdf ) . 
  it clearly states that s&p values the austerity measures and therefore have set the rating with a '' * stable outlook * with limited downside risk '' . 
  i think you guys are all confusing my ftfy image with the original one ... oh boy what did you do / u/habernam, 
  good luck !, 
  i had the same comment in [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/112z2k/multiculturalism_what_exactly_we_the_europeans/c6iu73f ) thread . 
  but the germans do n't like this viewpoint . 
  lhbt but lgbt will do fine too . 
   no , the country became part of the french empire in 1813 . 
  huh ? 
  in 1813 the french left and willem i came to the throne . 
  its the end of the french time in nl . 
  what french empire are you talking about ? 
  yep . 
  heineken and amstel . 
  true , that is shocking . 
  luckily , our government feels the same and is working to pass laws that make this much easier and without operations . 
  http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/homo-emancipatie/gelijke-rechten-homoseksuelen-en-transgenders the sterilisation requirement is about to be dropped . 
  fair enough , to each his own , but i think there are other issues in the country that are more important - i think our our drugs , euthanasia and gsm situations are pretty good , and used comparison to other countries as an argument for that . 
   portugal has better soft drug laws are you sure !?? 
  well ... not completely . 
  notice how the snow-countries cry for summer and the sun-countries cry for less heat . 
  the netherlands can have real nice summer ( period ) s and real nice winters ( with nice winters i do mean real winters , with snow etc ) . 
  it 's true that we have a lot of rain , but that 's also good for many other things . 
  dutch climate is not extreme in anything and you have all types of weather cycled through the year . 
  i always liked it . 
  beautiful picture by the way ... not changing my opinion :-), 
  i 'm a bit puzzled by this . 
  on all those things we are the most liberal country in the world . 
  is n't that enough ? 
  maybe wish for some other issues first before we completely remove every drug and euthanasia rules ? 
  i 'm telling you guys , dutch climate is almost perfect . 
  this should be on top, 
  it do n't consider it a scam . 
  french highways are a bliss when you just drove through bumpy cracky belgium , and we are happy to pay for them , especially with the efficient peage 's , wide multiple lanes and perfect asphalt . 
  and , there is a free alternative in the route national if you are not in a hurry and/or do n't want to pay . 
  good job , france . 
  shut up and take my money . 
  this is a racist joke . 
  do n't like it . 
  lol, 
  i tried but google translate could not help me with the punchline . 
  so basically , this guy dies and goes to hell which turns out to be the eu . 
  all countries are hell , with shit and beatings , and it 's the same in greece , but everyone looks fine in there and . . but . . and then i 'm lost . 
   when we tried to think about our own survival and while you were thinking about your own survival , why not make a deal to annex a couple of countries as well ? 
   and i do n't think it 's fair towards either hungarians or jews to assign nobel laureates to the wrong group . 
  we should stick to facts . 
  that 's not what this was about or an answer to my question . 
  this is about wether they are jew or hungarian . 
  but ... but . . everyone knows sissi ... 
  right ? 
  so you say that someone that is assimilated in one or two ( or three , whatever you like ) generations can be considered a czech , but a jew will always and ever remain a jew and never a czech , no matter how much intermarriage and culture-assimilation has occurred ? 
  let 's go back to the issue we started with . 
  do n't you think it 's more fair to say that those scientist from hungary probably had both a lot of hungarian culture as well as jewish culture in their behavior ? 
  so why not call them jewish-hungarian ( like wikipedia does ) , and let botd44 be proud ( or not ) of their contribution as a hungarian . 
  some of them had their education on hungarian universities with hungarian culture that allowed them to do this work . 
  some of them had multiple generations of hungarian ancestors . 
  i do n't understand why this is news , we had this in the netherlands since 1986 . 
  so if the german and his german wife in question have children in the czech republic , are they czech or german ? 
  and their grand-children ? 
  and what if the mother was `` czech '' ? 
  and what if the great-great-grandfather of the german was russian ? 
  what does being `` czech '' mean according to you ? 
  what does being `` german '' mean to you ? 
  there is no satisfying fixed definition of nationality except what is in your passports . 
  everything else is `` labels '' arbitrarily created by humans that like to order things and put them in boxes . 
  then the jews : what are jews according to you ? 
  certainly , `` jewish '' is not a nationality , there is no `` jewland '' . 
  ( no israel is not anymore ) . 
  it 's a religion & accompanying cultural behavior , no more no less . 
  jews as `` a people '' or `` a race '' really is nonsense after 2000 years of genetic mixup . 
  this is weird . 
  there are jews with czech passports that pay czech taxes and are recorded in czech municipal registrations , right ?
