  so they are jew and czechs . 
  people can be identified by nationality , religion , affiliations , race , ethnic descendancy , genetic makeup , language etc etc. . off course people can be many things at the same time . 
  it 's not black & white , however much you would like it to be . 
  or the survey is just nonsense, 
  pretty good , although you do hear lots of `` anglicisms '' in word choices and word-order . 
  half-russian father , dutch mother , raised in dutch and english , married to a spanish wife . 
  speaks dutch , english , french , german and spanish . 
  even for dutch standards that 's pretty impressive . 
  hey everybody from nl that wants flanders/belgium to join : there was a reason why they left ( yes , they left us and made a big fight about it ) and it was only 180 years ago . 
  not much of the reasons have changed ... 
  this would be like battlestar galactica : this has happened before and it will happen again ... 
  this . 
  the atrocities that the dutch troops perpetrated in indonesia just after ww2 have been kept silent for a long time . 
  only recently more and more information is coming out . 
  even today , a new picture was identified where indonesian `` rebels '' were murdered . 
  i still use `` tientje '' for $ 10 note . 
   according to part-time superhero rajish sagoeni , former president of the royal felowship for actual things . . 
  brilliant translation !, 
  part time superhero = pension expert . 
  royal fellowship for actual things ( what is this ? 
  harry potter ? ), 
  = royal society of actuaries . 
  not for long . 
  canceling of this law was accepted in parliament last march . 
   some 55 % of the adult population is religious . 
  that 's what the churches report from their membership registration , but that 's notoriously unreliable . 
  only 19 % visit church or mosque . 
  how many people really believe in a god , we will never know .

  thanks , [ til ] ( http://support.twitter.com/forums/26810/entries/78525 ), 
  how is a tweet linked to an `` originating '' location , and by who ? 
  i can only think of twitter themselves and based on originating ip address . 
  is that it ? 
  til , thanks . 
  can someone tell me what [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e8buwlo.png ) is ? 
  ( or who ? ), 
  but . . but . . charlemange . . 
  because of bulgaria joining in 2007, 
  i like that it has a bit more color . 
  i 'm all for the euro , but our old dutch money was 100x more beautiful . 
  now find something original !, 
  finally some sensible thoughts from the ( financial ) media on the state of europe . 
  yes !, 
  in proper dutch it 's `` sleurhut '' . 
  so if i start paying belgian road-tax in 2016 as a foreigner , you guys better make sure that the long wapper is there !!, 
  dat traffic jam on the ring . 
  * `` as all countries in this group would have at least one germanic national or official language ( flemish for belgium , swedish for finland ) , they might even adopt german as their lingua franca . 
  '' * what is this ? 
  a joke ? 
  british junk media ? 
  did i say that ? 
  op , from your post-history i understand that you like to emphasize problems in the dutch economy , but linking to 5-months old articles is a bit sad . 
  literally `` old news '' . 
  the numbers for belgium are messed up i think . 
  for half of the population , french is their primary language . 
  so i assume the 45 % that speak french well enough applies to those that have dutch as their first language . 
  also , according to that table , only 10 % of the people in the uk think they speak english well enough to have a conversation ... 
  edit : the question probably was : what language other than your first language do you speak well enough to have a conversation . 
  so for belgium , this messes it up big time . 
  i wonder when you will start babbling about the `` pure czech race '' . 
  from what i have heard/read , amsterdam reminds people of sf . 
  except for the weather off course . 
  lisbon is also often mentioned . 
  but do n't take my word for it , i have n't been to either san fransico or lisbon . 
  right , it was build as a church . 
  it 's still full of christian images for crying out loud !, 
  yes , but it at least shows that the perceived problems with the eu are not important enough to vote for the far-left or - right . 
  do n't forget that in the last elections anti-eu parties were obliterated into nothingness . 
  apparently , below the whining about the eu we do n't really mean it or we do n't really care . 
  the map does n't take dykes into account . 
  our dykes are not only one meter high at the moment . 
  what you see blue at +1 meter is already below sea level at this moment . 
  punch in some dykes now , this is what you get . 
  because of some agreements regarding flooding land to restore nature to compensate for the antwerp industrial area , they were not allowed to build dykes - enforced by nature-lobby groups . 
  so now they all had to move to wallonia . 
  they should have known after hedwige . 
  that 's only one of the possible influences . 
  the truth is that it 's just not known exactly how and why it changed from orange to red . 
  i doubt that is a major issue since islam is all over the place already . 
  i live in the netherlands , and we have a mosque in every town , muslims in local and state governments , muslim holidays respected in companies etc. 
  so as long as sharia law is n't creeping into eu laws , i 'm fine . 
  and i doubt that will ever happen . 
  all the practical problems aside , if you look at the big picture , especially looking at the history of conflicts of christian europe and islamist east , i feel that turkey joining the eu would be a great step forward . 
  - if we have turkey in the eu , we would have some influence in the direction it 's going with it 's de-secularization trend . 
  - it would be a great `` bridge '' politically and culturally between islam all over the world and secular/christian/free europe/west . 
  - it would break the current trend of `` us '' against `` them '' : the west against islam . 
  i do n't think we want an islam superstate , a new calipathe . 
  do n't worry turkey , the dutch are coming to protect you !, 
  ( with about 80 % of our army that 's left ), 
  the netherlands : - government budget cuts and the pretty heavy effect this will have on most people 's wallets . 
  - real estate prices ( homes ) that drop like a rock causing already 700.000 houses to be worth less than the mortgage on it . 
  - to shift our focus , we get worked up about whales that have beached on our shores and then die . 
  government debates , silent marches , protests , the whole thing ... dont ask me !, 
  a lot of italians but also others in europe ( i 've heard this from more than one belgian for instance ) are attracted by berlusconi 's `` bad boy '' - and bourgondic ( lack better word ) lifestyle image . 
  i think this is 100 % attributed to the housing drama . 
  while technically correct for this map , to indicate the whole of texas as 85-mph is a bit misleading ( ok , ok , it misleaded * me * ) . 
  [ there is only a 41-mile stretch of one particular highway where it 's 85 mph . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speed_limits_in_the_united_states_by_jurisdiction#80_and_85_mph_limits ), 
  i want to comment on this but ...
