  i am ... fallling ... asle . . dsabfd vxg, 
  opzij , opzij from `` party animals '' on the good vibrations album . 
  well lets hope russia and china never team up ... 
  i think you should be worried about your os patches . 
  ok , but then why the lazyness in naming streets ? 
  you just number them ... whats the fun in that . . 
  we sold all our tanks ... 
  in other words , 2016 was nothing compared to 1910 ... 
  '' ... will begin on april 31st ... '' stop video . 
   limes i think you linked to something incorrectly , but apart from that : the limes does n't refer to a physical wall , but to the border of the ( entire ) roman empire . 
  sinds jij in de titel schreef : '' ... the largest city not to exist ... '', 
  ehm ... first houses were ready in 1976 . 
  so technically it was there before the 80 's ... 
  ok - garni used modern concrete and in france they used modern , newly cut , natural stone . 
  what 's the difference in determining `` real '' or `` original '' ... ? 
  whats the difference between a building undergone `` many times extensive restorations '' and `` collapsed and rebuild '' . 
  with any medi\u00ebval or older building you find in europe you need to ask ourself how `` real '' it is - remember [ the theseus paradox ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ship_of_theseus ) none of those buildings in `` working order '' ( i.e. 
  not complete ruins ) are really completely in their original state as they were constructed . 
  that , and maintenance , repairs and rebuilds ever since it was constructed . 
  it 's misleading to suggest that it was built in 112 and stayed like this ever since . 
  this is true for any old construction in europe by the way . 
  i found it mildly interesting until he started scaremongering about extreme-right taking over europe and economic downfall . 
  well that turned out a little bit different . 
  malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes says british doctor !, 
  as the byzantine empire :-), 
  not to mention hundreds of years apart . 
  well it 's your fault ... we had a republic but the french invaded us and turned it back into a monarchy !, 
  americans are n't idots . 
  so it 's safe to assume we are paying for it one way or another . 
  in any case , it would be wise for europe to be able defend themselves and it would reduce our debt to the usa at the same time . 
  i do n't understand why you get downvoted so much . 
  it 's clear we do n't spend enough for defence ... 
  most european leaders/governments agree something needs to change in the light of current global tensions and also the eu officials have made statements like this . 
  in my own pacifistic little country we have reduced military spending to the absolute bare minimum during the crisis , but in current government formation negotiations , increased spending on defence is a given . 
  ( we have to from keeping it falling apart completely ), 
  what ? 
  it lasted an entire day !, 
  i agree what that last statement . 
  op 's assumption that a minority of muslims make a democratic country a sharia-state is by no means a given . 
  i do n't agree with op , but these are bad arguments . 
  last time ( part of ) spain was under muslim rule was more then 600 years ago . 
  completely different islam in a completely different europe in a completely different time . 
  you ca n't conclude anything from it for our time and situation . 
  i think the chinese and indians ( hindus ) in malaysia do n't agree with you . 
  there is enough to be scared about for them . 
  malaysia was a example for the world for freedom of faith , but this is rapidly declining with the islamists slowly getting more influence in politics . 
  basically , ethnic malaysians need to be muslim , and sharia is in effect for them , enforced by police .

  i think the tax-paying hard-working germans think it 's not so free . 
  yeah , that was a tricky one . 
  i interpreted that as atheist = religious believes are not important . 
  my atheist views very important , but they are definitely not my `` religious beliefs '' . 
  gee , it was just a question , downvoters . 
  in [ the netherlands , alcohol is not a drug ] ( http://www.government.nl/issues/alcohol-and-drugs ) . 
  it 's a language thing , not a statement about the physiological effects of it . 
  i love the guy , but this is weak . 
  sure , you can be agnostic about god , but also about the spagetti monster and the teapot and ghosts etc. 
  he surely is not agnostic about the end of the world in 2012 , why is he agnistic about god ? 
  alcohol is a drug ? 
  well , maybe the circlejerk word just does n't apply in both cases , because i 'm seeing just as many anti-eu posts by britons as vice-versa . 
  and then again , what is `` anti '' , right ? 
  and a british anti-eu circlejerk as well . 
  i think there 's no reason to assume that the troubles between flanders and wallonia within belgium would not exist at some or all levels between flanders and the nertherlands in `` great-netherlands '' . 
  well ... just like a cloud is shaped like a sheep ? 
  if it 's true , i really didnt know that , but i 'm not going to take your word for it . 
  i 'm not picking a fight , i just want to learn . 
  please explain the following : - like i quoted above from the articles that soncredible linked to , mr. kadir nurman said `` i knew doner-dishes from turkey and noticed something like that did n't exist here '' . 
  so what does that mean ? 
  - the wikipedia article on doner-kebab says that it goes back to ottoman times . 
  sure , there is a german-version of it developed by immigrants , but so are other versions of doner all over the world - doner is not reserved german word . 
  the article on `` kebab '' says : * d\u00f6ner kebab , literally `` rotating kebab '' in turkish , is sliced lamb , beef or chicken , slowly roasted on a vertical rotating spit . 
  the middle eastern shawarma , mexican tacos al pastor and greek gyros are all derived from the turkish d\u00f6ner kebab which was invented in bursa in the 19th century by a cook named hac\u0131 \u0130skender *, 
  did you read any of those or the wikipedia article ? 
  it says that the guy was the first to ** introduce ** it in germany . 
  not invent it . 
  what ? 
  are we talking about [ this stuff ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doner_kebab ) ? 
  apart from the fact we have it in nl as well since the 70s , it 's really turkish and it definitely did not originate in germany . 
  i love the one about coffee . 
  it 's really weird - i ca n't even get google translate to come up with that ridiculous dutch sentence with any english input . 
  edit : oh i got it : `` am i allowed then take a heineken '' ... 
  what 's the netherlands supposed to be ? 
  no , i meant actual anti-continent sentiments . 
  a bit like how some scots talk about england . 
  my comment was n't targeted at you personally ( brainwashed ) , or to make you feel uncomfortable - apologies if it did . 
  i meant to say that - in my view - there is a lot of anti-europe ( it should be called `` anti-continent '' ) feelings exist in britain/uk and that this is supported a lot by `` the media '' . 
  i was just wondering if your idea that the countries on the continent were only so-so compared the uk was caused by that . 
  i do have to admit that here on reddit i see a lot of people from the uk that are more positive - i just have never met one in real life and i do meet them regularly . 
  because you are brainwashed by britisch media ? 
  sounds pretty good ? 
  this makes me think of / r/historyporn . 
  more than half of all pictures posted there are from * the war * . 
  you are in the 20 % :-), 
  it 's really weird how this is 100 % the opposite of the netherlands . 
  psst ... you have an italian flag, 
  you are generalizing everything and everybody : you read posts about europeans being skeptics , and you see lots of upvotes on a europe presented as a whole ( in a sports event ) , and then conclude europeans are hypocrits ? 
  the truth is that the opinions on the eu are divided over the entire spectrum : `` lets get out '' all the way to `` lets be the united states of europe '' . 
  there are 450 million ( or so ) europeans and by the very definition of what europe is ( lots of different cultures and languages , many with roots that go thousands of years back ) , they are very far from the homogenous group that the people of the usa are . 
  ( relatively speaking ) also , let 's say you live in the state of iowa ( quick guess based on your posts ) : do you identify more with iowa or usa ? 
  ( i 'm hoping you ca n't really answer that easily ... ),
