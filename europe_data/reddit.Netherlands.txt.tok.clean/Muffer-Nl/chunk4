  the shots in ` amsterdam ' were recorded in venice ... 
  apparently yes . 
  it 's actually a rather common thing to do in the netherlands . 
  many students live so called ` anti-kraak ' . 
  ` kraken ' is illegally living in unoccupied buildings . 
  it 's rather funny the woman they interviewed woman is dutch ^ ^, 
  not as good as the ones across the seas are though . 
  the netherlands will be darker , especially in rural areas as the government is moving towards movement activated lighting . 
  they can actually use buttons . 
  they ca n't light a fire and this includes making sparks . 
  whoops , faal . 
  it 's not necessary but it is more personal . 
  i am starting to feel bad about complaining about the dutch government . 
  mp 's very rarely miss a meeting , normally only for business travel and sickness . 
  first ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  amsterdam is not dam by the river but dam on the amstel , amstel being a relatively small river . 
  rotterdam does not mean borrowing water dam . 
  it means dam on the rotte . 
  the rotte , again , being a relatively small river . 
  antwerpen comes from handwerpen which mean throwing a hand . 
  this comes from an old folk tale that has something to do with throwing hands and a giant . 
  utrecht does not mean outside the crossing but rather downstream from the crossing . 
  for green meadow , i think this is groningen . 
  for groningen no real name origin is known but none of the theories have anything to do with green meadows . 
  in short , this map is pretty terrible . 
  sadly , no . 
  it 's pretty new yeah . 
  source : sister finished pabo 2 years ago . 
  if we do n't give them welfare they become homeless . 
  we hate homeless people , it makes out cities look bad . 
  and starting with english in kindergarten ... 
  if you 're an expat you get a temporary visa . 
  if you want to stay after that visa you have to learn dutch . 
  except when you are from england/france/germany / belgium and all those other european countries , free traffic of people and all . 
  something about not being able to speak dutch , trying to get everyone else to speak it . 
  something i could not understand and lastly about ` het groot dictee der nederlandse taal ', 
  if you have to know the national anthem to pass a citizen test the freaking queen would fail . 
  the problem is that these people wo n't incorporate in society and thus wo n't contribute anything truly meaningful to society . 
  there is a disproportional amount of people that do not pass these tests that are also on welfare . 
  the dutch normally like carrot and stick approach . 
  if rewards would be instated they would still be kicked out if they failed . 
  and then you get a letter from the government . 
  i know but this was about the pr budget right ? 
  diplomats are serious pr with foreign governments . 
  [ it 's pretty big .

  a different dutch reporter followed a group of refugees from syria to germany ( i think ) using the same types of transport . 
  yes ? 
  you are not allowed to operate as a driver while drunk . 
  found the dutch guy . 
  hey does 's ff normaal man !, 
  actually , a us big mac is notably larger than most european big macs . 
  not worth the hassle . 
  i respect your disagreement . 
  it is on mobile . 
  i also said i 'm dutch which means i 'm not 100 % familiar with the imperial system . 
  ` muricans are not capable of easy , on the fly coversions the way glorious yuropeans do them . 
  translating glorious metric to shitty imperial for the americans on here . 
  is that weird ? 
  i 'm 6 foot . 
  i 'm shorter than the average dutch person . 
  as a dutch person : that 's 32 cm more than needed . 
  also does n't distinguish all the different island dialects in the netherlands . 
  every island should have a slightly different colour . 
  as far as i have seen in the news the eu talks about reforms where the greeks talk about austerity and cuts . 
  yeah , an exit agreement .

  the netherlands has 11.8 % in the age group 19-64 . 
  12 . & % for all people aged 19 and up . 
  as other commenters have said , it is much too easy to connect voters to unwanted parties that way . 
  say the government in some country wants to track all the voters for the small fascist party , well , they can . 
  its not that i do n't trust my government not to do it , rather , i want my government not to have unnecessary data on me . 
  voter fraud can easily be reduced by sending out voter passes with unique numbers linked to your person . 
  when you give in the vote pass they check the number and give you a ballot from the top of the pile . 
  the ballot can then be unmarked as you can not vote more than once . 
  because voting is supposed to be entirely anonymous . 
  last source i found on this mentioned the dutch being more productive at 36 usd gdp per hour worked as opposed 34 for belgium . 
  flemish workers are almost as productive as the dutch . 
  wallonian workers are slightly more productive than french workers . 
   interaction : brits polite - germans direct germans direct ? 
  yes , gay yet up . 
  ( this is only very moderately insulting in dutch ), 
  well , everything is way too salty but what do you think all those other countries eat ? 
  one of the main reasons we eat quite healthy is because a lot of our food is prepared from fresh ingredients ( dinner that ) . 
  much more so than in other countries . 
  as for variety , the variety they look at here is the balance between fish , meat , dairy , different kinds of vegetables , fruit and grain products . 
  basically the variety means : do you get all your vitamins and minerals . 
  the dutch traditionally eat quite a lot of grain and dairy products for breakfast and lunch . 
  dinner almost always contains some sort of meat or fish and vegetables . 
  the dutch also eat quite a lot of fruit per capita . 
  also , potatoes are incredibly and i mean ridiculously healthy as far as staple food goes . 
  [ the dutch eat very healthy .
