but amsterdam is still `` the place '' to live in and the randstad is all in the same corner of our country . 
  a lot of head quarters from companies are in/around amsterdam and most of the banking and the big four are located at the zuidas . 
  in germany it 's all divided . 
  and those cities are too wide spread from each other to live in the one and work in another like you can do in the netherlands . 
  yes a lot of people who worked for the army are applying for asylum in a couple eu-countries . 
  shit is getting real ... 
  [ you would think they would know better ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transit_of_german_troops_through_finland_and_sweden ) . 
  i worked for 3 years in a store in maastricht . 
  thanks to that i can now sell shoes and clothes fluent in german , french/walloon and english . 
  traveled on the west coast last summer , starting in la , via national parks to zion and back to the coast to sf . 
  i was surprised to see in how many places you do n't have any service at all .

  gosh the ' 90 's and 2000 's must be responsible for 95 % of the horrible music out there . 
  i just thought it was funny how they all looked so similar . 
  yeah it 's indeed a law . 
  but i never used it in belgium where it is possible , you 're already standing next to the pump so why not hold it with your hand . 
  petrol , living near the border it was a 10 minute drive to a belgian petrol station , it was sometimes 20 cents cheaper per liter . 
  no clue how it is now , probably still the same . 
  when i worked in a super market the people came from belgium to us for some coffee brands . 
  for shampoo , deodorant etc. 
  we always went to germany to the dm , shampoo was more then $ 1 , - cheaper per bottle . 
  belgium yes , netherlands no . 
  this was my game when i worked in maastricht . 
  it 's in the south of the netherlands and next to the belgium border ( next to luik/liege/luttich ) and around a 15-20 min drive from the german border ( aachen ) so we had a lot of foreign customers . 
  flemmish women all went to the [ kreatos hairdresser for a short , asymmetric hair cut with a lot of high lights ] ( https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3b/f3/bb/3bf3bbd37bf4784b0ce3ebec7bf5fd91--short-haircut-styles-short-haircuts.jpg ) , the people from wallonia were always dressed in black with leather and often a chihuahua in their purse . 
  and german people were just german , more practically dressed and ( sorry ) a bit fatter in comparison to the dutch and belgian costumers . 
  side note , this is already 4-7 years ago when i worked there and it is of course a very specific kind of people who live in the neighborhood of maastricht . 
  the netherlands only have aldi nord . 
  apparently sud is more modern ? 
  the thing with snus is that you can use it everywhere you want . 
  you do n't bother other people with your smoke or whatever so you can just take some snus sitting on your desk . 
  is there actually some rules for this ? 
  i did an internship in sweden and smoking was prohibited within the whole building and they 're also very strict with even having alcohol in the office . 
  in the netherlands it 's pretty common to have a vrijdagmiddagborrel at the office which translates to a friday afternoon drink . 
  but now i think about it the only person i saw using snus at the office itself was the `` rebel '' guy who would also use it if it was prohibited , that 's why i 'm asking . 
  and i know that norway is not sweden but i 'm just curious . 
  depends where you live . 
  long post ahead !, 
  * the small town i grew up in ( used to be a town for miners , when the mines closed other factories came to fill in the void ) had the nickname speed city but most of the youth using drugs where `` gabbers '' otherwise you would maybe try some weed but that was it . 
  alcohol is very normal for all 15 + to use during parties or in cafe 's . 
  the local club did n't check for drugs but they had a metal detector when you entered ( thinking about that now after going out in amsterdam for 4 years it 's actually really fucked up that you need to enter a club trough a metal detector ) . 
  cigarettes where also pretty normal but as a teenager i never was attracted to it . 
  * in bigger cities ( as far you can call them big in the netherlands ) have a lot of drug use . 
  but it really depends on your social bubble . 
  the southern provinces in the netherlands are known for producing amphetamines and mdma and it 's used a lot at bigger parties . 
  in cities like eindhoven there is a lot of amphetamine usage in the cafe 's and it also `` allows '' you to drink more . 
  * amsterdam uses everything , i 'm actually surprised how many students use coca\u00efne , i have no clue how they pay for it actually because some use it almost every week . 
  it 's not weir for kids who grew up in amsterdam often use their first mdma around 15/16 years . 
  popular drugs in amsterdam ( as in you can find them at almost every `` menu '' the dealer sends you ) are : mdma/xtc ( pills or crystals ) , amphetamine ( speed , no meth ) , 2cd , 4-fmp ( this one is really big atm it 's like a combination between mdma and speed without a hangover but it 's fairly new and there is no scientific research about it ) , coca\u00efne , ketamine . 
  maybe i forgot something but these are the most common . 
  * you can buy weed in the so called coffee shops and truffels ( active substance is psylocibine the same as magic mushrooms but because the government is weird magic mushrooms are illegal but truffels are n't ) and other legal products like kratom in smart shops when you 're 18 + . 
  it 's not like everyone does this . 
  it 's the same as alcohol , it 's possible to buy/use but not everyone does it . 
  * it depends on your surroundings how they look at psychedelics like lsd , dmt etc. 
  a lot of people think they 're scary for some reason . 
  * heroin is ( almost ) only used by people who are 50 + . 
  i never heard stories about someone of my age who has tried it and i know a lot of people with a big interest in drugs . 
  in some cities you still have a so called `` methadon bus '' where addicts can get there shot of methadon to keep them of the heroin and the people i saw there were also all 50 + . 
  ama is something was unclear/if you do n't agree with what i said because this is ofcourse only from my own surroundings . 
   every dutchman is still sad about the loss of hyves . 
  no more gadgets and glitterplaatjes ;(, 
  belgium still has those poles also . 
  last month i was driving in france for a week , the annoying thing about the trucks is that they 're allowed to pass each other . 
  so when they 're driving 3 km/h faster as the one in front of them they immediately switch lanes and try to pass them for 5 minutes . 
  until you 're past the ring in antwerp on the e34 towards zeeuws-vlaanderen ( part of the netherlands which only connects by land with belgium ) . 
  there is a part of the road where all the frequent drivers drive on the left lane because the right lane is really terrible/bad for your car . 
  belgium loves those plates of concrete . 
  i 've been driving on the german highway for the last 5 summers . 
  from different places in the netherlands to berlin or a festival between leipzig/dresden . 
  the roadworks are horrible . 
  last weekend i drove there on friday and came back on sunday and there were 6 places where the road went to 1 lane . 
  the most annoying thing was that i only saw 2 ( ! ), 
  people working along the whole route . 
  two people , on a trip of 1400 km in total . 
  when i go to berlin during summer most off the time i need to calculate an extra 2-3 hours because off all the stau . 
  furthermore the roads itself are nice , 
  80 % of the women in nl once they get kids , because it 's practical . 
  the street i grew up in was build in the ' 80 's , one side was owner-occupied houses and the other side was social housing . 
  as long as i can remember there was always at least 1 house occupied with a family with refugees . 
  most of the time they came from afghanistan or iraq . 
  my dad often helped them with filling in papers , the small children often came to visit us and we would give them clothes i outgrew or lend them children books . 
  i also vividly remember that when i was 11 years old there was an afghan girl in my class and together with a friend ( we were always quick with completing the assignments in class so we had `` extra '' time ) we received the responsibility to help her dutch reading skills . 
  the strangest thing was that the family suddenly moved and i never found out why/what happened . 
  on high school i had multiple class mates from bosnia and i worked together with a girl from iran . 
  they all came here as a child so they were lucky and could start with any bachelor they wanted without any problems of `` translating '' diploma 's etc. 
  there is [ ijburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ijburg ) which are a couple of artificial islands in amsterdam . 
  atm there are 4 islands and the plan is to make 3 more . 
  yes !, 
  lived in stockholm for 6 moths , thought it was pretty strange but i could never explain it to my housemates ( who were also from abroad ) . 
  op is a funny guy . 
  do you know how much time it takes to do your hair in the morning ? 
  this shows way more character , shows your life is spontaneous and love to buy [ house accessories at action ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=action+huis&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewihxojpg7hvahwhlfakhdotc_4q_auicigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=700 ) .

  + there is already 2 years of english lessons on primary school . 
  although i did n't learn anything new during those lessons . 
  for high school , i had 6 years of 3h per week dutch lessons , same amount of english lessons , from the 1-4th year french lessons ( 2 hours i believe ) , 2-4th year german lessons same amount of hours per week as french . 
  in the 4th year you need to choose a `` profile '' , so if you want to specialise towards society ( history / geography/economics ) you need to keep the languages till your exams in the last year . 
  when you choose to follow classes oriented towards science ( chemistry/physics/different kind of math etc. ), 
  you cold drop a language .
