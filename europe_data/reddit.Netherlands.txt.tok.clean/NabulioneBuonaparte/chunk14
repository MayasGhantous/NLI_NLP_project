  [ there seems to be no pattern to them ] ( http://imgur.com/a/nvk4v ) are they intentionally random to spice up the streets a bit or just remnants of some kind ? 
  it 's like a patriotic version of playing hard to get . 
  there 's probably a thai prostitute somewhere that can make generalisations with her vagina for you . 
  britanny is about as big as its supposedly great counterpart here . 
  that line of doom through turkey is way too neat . 
  we really should let all the european colonizers rebuild their old ships and have them duke it out . 
  that would be quality entertainment . 
  not sure how we 'll prevent fatalities though . 
  we 'll work something out . 
  yep , only protestants . 
  * ` er zit stront aan de knikker ' * ( ` there 's shit on the marble ' ) which means : ` something is not right ', 
  we have something similar : * ` er zit een addertje onder het gras ' * ( there 's a viper under the grass ), 
  [ i have no idea what you 're talking about ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/gereformeerd.svg/1024px-gereformeerd.svg.png?1496656988372 ) keep in mind these are only the dutch protestant ones , and most of them contain subdenominations . 
  people like leaders who ` get things done ' , regardless of how beneficial those things are in the long term . 
  you name a pm who had the far-reaching power and time that he had . 
  i suppose so . 
  our weed use per capita is half that of the us though , it 's mostly for the tourists . 
  san marino before that . 
  the vatican is at least the center of a world religion . 
  flowers really is ` our thing ' in east-asia , is n't it . 
  better than the other type of plant most westeners associate us with though . 
  that 's interesting . 
  over here the fertile crescent is usually seen as the big ` birthplace of civilisation ' . 
  ( together with india , egypt and china ) i guess that includes part of asia minor , but most people think of mesopotamia . 
  did they buy mercenaries ? 
  most of those look utterly dystopian to be honest . 
  it 's all cold , flat prefab made to look efficient and as a real-life portfolio of some self-proclaimed revolutionary architect . 
  most of it is dated within the decade and combined with the artificial feeling of the city itself it just does n't make a nice living environment . 
  i honestly believe that those building styles will be the brutalism of our age . 
  i 'm already dizzy by just looking at it . 
  did n't it reach to the black sea for some time ? 
  at a certain age you should n't try to look young anymore though , 
  probably true as well . 
  i 'm not deterred by pkk attacks but public sentiment is harder to judge from a distance . 
  thanks for the insight , i 'll keep it in mind . 
  funny , i think the opposite . 
  it was morally right to do what he did , but according to law he commited treason and should be tried accordingly . 
  you do n't want to set precedent where leaking classified information is simply allowed , but i 'm really glad that brave guys like him are willing to do it for the rest of us . 
  i like lime best tbh , the other one is too bright and flashy for her . 
  you 're probably right , but a 10 % chance of being scolded or beat up because of my nationality is still too high . 
  i think i 'll wait a few years or pass myself off as a belgian . 
  i will come to visit eventually though , your country is way too interesting and beautiful to completely write off . 
  it 's only nice if he 's planning on expanding into his neighbours . 
  it 's a defensive alliance after all . 
  if he 'd just take care of his people and keep his borders in his pants he would n't even notice it existed . 
  good job on picking the nietzsche pic where he looks like a sassy fashion designer . 
  it 's more that my nationality probably wo n't be appreciated . 
  azerbaijanis probably do n't have that problem . 
  we have that with germany . 
  our finance minister once said that his policy has less influence on our economy than the decisions of his german colleague . 
  i googled around for a bit , but none of them mention gypsies . 
  they 're relatively tame , the really zany ones probably are n't put on the net . 
  some examples : [ one ] ( http://www.burgercomitenl.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bcnl_cpflyer.jpg ) , [ two ] ( https://ejbron.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot_55.png?w=408&amp;h=286 ) , [ three . 
  ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/archives/images/flyerbijgesneden.png ) the first one argues that ukraine is corrupt to the bone , that we 'll get caught up in russia 's power game , that free trade does n't need an association treaty to happen , and that it 's the first step towards accession to the union . 
  the second one is just some bulletpoints , in true pvv fashion . 
  same gist , but with two lines about saying no to the elite in brussels and the eu in general . 
  the last one sets out a timeline for croatia 's accession process and the important dates of the association treaty . 
  some scary question marks indicate that ukraine , georgia and moldova are going to follow the same path . 
  i sense a preference for italian cities . 
  but then again , who does n't have that . 
  the wider the channel the safer right ? 
  joke 's on you !, 
  that water is already below sea level !, 
  nope , says he does n't have time for it . 
  he 's a pretty funny guy but his social life is n't very exciting . 
  jesus christ that 's amazing . 
  why is there a cabinet in front of the door on the left though . 
  haha he was n't lying !, 
  i can really appreciate our shared ` sachlichkeit ' and lack of pomposity when it comes to leaders . 
  just give them a nice enough office to sign papers and entertain some ambassadors and it 's fine . 
  [ it 's in the little tower on the left . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/binnenhof_met_hofvijver_en_torentje_%28den_haag%29_-_panoramio.jpg ) pretty subtle considering the nice building attached to it . 
  we have a similar taste in leaders here . 
  level-headed , semi-nerdy accountant-in-chiefs who are unlikely to get themselves into a scandal . 
  our pm does n't even have a wife to cheat on . 
  it looks nice and tidy , but really does n't have as much character as the french/italian ones . 
  maybe it 's my personal interest in history but i like a room with backstory . 
  danube slav sounds like a species of river mermaids with adidas stripes on their tail to be honest . 
  not yet . 
  we figured the name would make the inevitable annexation go down easier . 
  edit : also you guys kind of ruined dietsland for us . 
  they kinda won the revolution because of franco-british intervention didn `` t they ? 
  were there any other occassions ? 
  we 'll probably lose due to attrition on their dismal roads though . 
  we love roads so much that up north we closed off our inland sea in order to build a road on the dike . 
  yet ironically people still call us holland . 
  ( not that i care . 
  sounds catchier ), 
  i can only apologize for my countrymen , but it 's good to hear that things are improving . 
  i 'll correct people 's attitudes if i notice it , though the best antidote to ignorance is people like you being abroad and showing that most romanians are just regular guys . 
  okay , sorry to hear that . 
  i hope things have changed for the better since then . 
  i 'll definetly keep an eye out for such attitudes and stick up for you guys . 
  people should n't be made to feel uneasy because of their nationality . 
  where did you study ? 
  i 'm quite suprised by the anti-romanian sentiment you guys seem to notice . 
  a lot of our crime nowadays is from bulgarian/romanian gangs but i expected most people to differentiate between them and average citizens . 
  especially when those people are university-educated . 
  solid banter . 
  the spanish fleet got me .
