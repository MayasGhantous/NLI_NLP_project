fuck that . 
  you do n't joke about the system . 
  you know he 's joking , right ? 
  i would n't exactly call italy very religious in the first place . 
  but i guess you 're right . 
  but that has nothing to do anymore with islam . 
  southern italy can be a dangerous place for tourists too . 
   the mods removed it without any warning how surprising . 
  do n't you know you have to be irrationally pro-immigrants before you 're allowed to post a thread about it here ? 
  [ it 's not very spectacular , really . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xynpjgamixo ) it 's just basic common sense . 
  what 's refreshing is seeing someone on the tv actually having it . 
  ... remember that viral video of hans rosling ? 
   makes me feel unsafe . 
  that 's what journalists do . 
  in my understanding , the joke was a * commentary * on the fact that they are treated that way . 
  what exactly is racist about this ? 
  it 's just a satirical video . 
  i do n't know , for some reason i always associate hysterical arguing with american culture . 
  `` inciting '' ? 
  at one point they seem to be actually * kicking * one of them as she falls to the ground . 
  religion ruins * everything * . 
  even boobies . 
  [ this was in macedonia ] ( https://youtu.be/5cj9wj2ktfc?t=1m59s ) . 
  poor guy 's not gon na know what hit him . 
  on a side note , i think it 's easier to get used to cold . 
  as my grandmother used to say `` you can put on more clothes if it 's too cold , you ca n't take off your skin if it 's too hot . '', 
  of course , she had lived in southern italy all her life , so that was easy for her to say . 
  imagine the shitstorm if those signs said `` no mexicans '' . 
  it 's a totally different situation as californians and portlandians ( ? ), 
  are all americans , but it 's the same principle . 
  my point is that the principle happens * everywhere * . 
  that it does n't really matter how different or the same people are . 
  sure , the problems get worse when people are increasingly different from each other , but it happens everywhere . 
   our news outlets are an embarrassment , our politics flawed to the point we do n't even care anymore and our media wo n't care for reporting about it anymore . 
  hey that sounds familiar ... 
  i think you would feel right at home here . 
  see it as an investment :p, 
  well i do n't live in germany , so i do n't know everything that 's going on there . 
  that 's why i asked . 
  i only have my own country as reference , and here we have also always been getting refugees , but this refugee crisis is something that only started recently . 
  so it 's only since recently that politians start talking about it and thinking about what to do . 
  with the last elections there was no talk about refugees . 
  the topics where austerity , surveillance , further legalization of soft drugs . 
  so i was just wondering what the situation was in germany . 
  because from what i understand , this decision to leave dublin iii for what it is whas a recent one . 
  not something that was mentioned during an election campaign . 
  and that 's kind of my point . 
  a party can promise nice things during an election , but if they later decide not to do it , or to change it , or to do something they never even mentioned at all because it was n't a topic at the time , there is nothing the people can do about it . 
  when the vvd promised `` more police '' in a time when people got stabbed and kicked to death in alleys every weekend , i do n't think many people could have foreseen that the result would be the surveillance state we have now . 
  when they made all kinds of nice promises about austerity measures they would never take , people were outraged when they announced them months later , but all the outrage in the world could n't stop it . 
  we have a say in * who * does the things , and we can hope that those `` who 's '' keep their promises , but in the end we have very little say in what ultimately happens . 
  i ca n't say i have much experience with moroccans . 
  i have always lived in relatively homogenous area 's of the netherlands . 
  i think moroccans mostly live in the west . 
  the few experience i do have , however , are n't exactly positive . 
  i have been threatened twice , and once gave someone a ride on my bike who was fleeing from police ( i knew him personally , and he had n't done anything serious , he had just drunkenly shoved someone and the police saw that ) . 
  in any case , it 's a common prejudice here that moroccans are all dangerous , antisocial criminals . 
  which is n't really fair , but understandable where it comes from . 
  a disproprtionate large group of young moroccans * do * behave this way . 
  if you ask me , it all boils down to their parents never having been `` properly integrated '' . 
  the way children are raised is * very * different in morocco . 
  if a child is being cheecky to anyone , he gets a wack . 
  this can be a parent , a teacher , but also a neighbour or any adult encountered on the street really . 
  and parents count on that . 
  they * expect * other people to do this when they 're not around . 
  while here it is absolutely not done to interfere with the upbringing of other people 's children in any way . 
  mix this with often growing up poor and being treated as a `` dirty foreigner '' all your life ( while being part of a * proud * culture ) and it 's not so surprising that you get a generation of problem youth . 
  for example , my mother is a teacher , and a couple years ago she was telling the mother of a moroccan student about the trouble he was causing in class . 
  her response : `` yes that 's because you do n't beat him , of course he 's going to do whatever he wants then . 
  you should beat him '' . 
  edit : and now please do n't take this a rant about `` all those dirty moroccans '' . 
  there are plenty of people out there just being normal , decent people . 
  but the culture clash is very real ; and the problem youth * are * out there . 
  i just happen to have only met those people . 
  maybe this is an * incredibly * naive question ; but looking at that picture it almost looks like an entirely new town . 
  ca n't they just build some infrastructure there , some irrigation , and let it become an actual new town ? 
  that makes sense . 
  and i think you 're right . 
  my dad , being an italian , has had no problem integrating in dutch society , while we 've had huge problems with for example moroccans . 
  a certain familiarity certainly makes it easier . 
  but i also think that that stops being a that important factor on this scale . 
  we 're talking about * millions * of refugees pouring into countries . 
  a country ca n't handle that on it 's own , which will cause big problems , which will be be blamed on the newcomers . 
  did they ? 
  was that in the election programme ? 
  i 'm seriously asking , 'cause i do n't know . 
  i think that for the refugee , yes , there is certainly an element of familiarity . 
  but i really do n't think this matters much for the `` natives '' . 
  immigrants are immigrants , and thus mistrusted by xenophobes . 
  only yesterday i came across [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/3jmu42/no_californians_stickers_being_slapped_on_for/?ref=search_posts ) . 
  wherever big waves of immigrants arrive , there will be people among the local populace who are n't happy with that , even within the same freaking country . 
  hitler was democratically elected . 
  just sayin ' , politicians can be elected all they want , but if they then proceed to do whatever they want , the people does n't have a say anymore . 
  not at all saying that this is the case in germany , i 'm just pointing out that the `` you chose them so you 've had your say , you ca n't complain now '' argument is equally old . 
  and also kind of dumb . 
  does n't matter , it 's a different country . 
  look at how polish and romanian workers were `` welcomed '' by people in western european countries . 
  see that 's the problem . 
  you ca n't get past the fact that it 's illegal * ergo * never do it .
