  and of course , as with everything , it 's gotten completely out of hand . 
  now people are desparately looking for ways to also be a victim of something . 
  * anything * . 
   product of said free-press is a direct reflection of the thoughts and inclinations of said nation maybe that 's exactly people 's complaint , that many have stopped doing that and started influencing it instead . 
  now you 're just arguing semantics . 
  come on , everybody can understand that the person who initally brought up `` thought policing '' did n't mean that there are people who are literally policing and oppressing our every thought and word , 1984 style . 
  but that 's not what people mean when they say that . 
  if i would start bothering everyone i meet about all the things they say that are n't pc enough , i 'm `` policing '' their speech . 
  it 's metaphorical . 
  they are completely free to ignore me and continue speaking as they wish , but i 'm still being an annoying twat , and they still have every right to grow tired of me . 
  it 's pretty innocent if it happens like that , but already extremely annoying and unsympethatic . 
  and it 's this principle that 's almost become the rule on the internet . 
  you have to be very careful what you say in some places , or be accused of racism , or * insert specific genocide * - denial , or whatever , even if that 's not true at all . 
  the only places where you do n't have to watch out for that are places where people are * actually * racist , or whatever kind of - ist they may be . 
  even you are guilty of this , in a way . 
  reporting someone , having them effectively censored , because they are n't expressing themselves `` civil '' enough in your eyes ? 
  so you just have what they said removed alltogether ? 
  that 's kind of petty ( teeny tiny bit arrogant as well ) if you ask me . 
  but then again , maybe the comment * was * truly disgusting . 
  i never read it myself so i ca n't judge for myself . 
  you made sure of that . 
  edit : and from what i gather , it does n't seem like it was a very unreasonable comment ... you just did n't like what it said , probably because it said something negative about muslims . 
  this is exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  the other guy sums it up pretty nicely . 
  having power has nothing to do with it . 
  you just start nagging at everyone for not using the proper language and you 're doing it . 
  and tons of people do it . 
  then i 'm not sure what you want from me . 
  what , you want the coordinates of all the houses of all the people who do this ? 
  are you denying that they exist in the first place ? 
  do you simply not remember who i 'm referring to ? 
  because they 're especially all over the internet , for starters . 
  right . 
   dunno , ** people ** sure are trying . 
  that the rest of the people does n't listen ( yet ) , does n't mean ** they ** 're not doing it . 
  forbidding them from practicing their religion . 
  that would be a violation of their religious rights . 
  should we stop eating pork and drinking alcohol when they can see it as well ? 
  should women hide their offensive hair and make up ? 
  that 's a stupid example , nobody is forcing them to start draw mohamed . 
  but they 're forbidding `` us '' from drawing him too . 
  that 's exactly like  if some muslim extremists want our women to wear them that is contrary to our liberal laws as it would be against our women freedom so exactly what you say . 
  untill it becomes illegal in our countries to draw mohamed , everyone is absolutely allowed to . 
  because then it 's against real people instead of a made up god . 
  that people feel personally offended if their god is insulted is mainly their problem . 
  then i guess we 're the blatter . 
  you should read the article / u/crnaruka posted . 
  it 's completely reasonable and plausible for the police to have already been at full capacity that night . 
  dunno , people sure are trying . 
  that the rest of the people does n't listen ( yet ) , does n't mean they 're not doing it . 
  i think both cases apply and feed off each other . 
   muslim invasion and oppression medieval muslim society was actually extremely enlightened and free . 
  science flourished and there was very little religious oppression going on . 
  iberian jews and muslims co-existed peacefully . 
  only after the peninsula was conquered by the christians did the jews start getting persecuted . 
  it was christian europe that had inquisitions to sniff out heretics and torture them to death . 
  there was nothing noble and righteous about the massacring of `` pagans '' . 
  it was n't when charlemagne did it with the saxons , it was n't when they did it in the baltics , and it was n't when they did it with muslims in jerusalem . 
  thinking it was makes you the only sick thing here . 
  edit : so apparently the crusades that were specifically against muslims were a good thing !, 
  which the christians of course totally were n't . 
  at least i 'm glad to see the mods have stopped censoring so extremely . 
  that 's progress i gues ... 
  well you 're * kind of * right ... 
  you already said that . 
  i was always told that it was because the native americans were n't suited for the hard labour on the plantations , and the ( generally ) bigger and stronger africans were . 
  edit : did i say something wrong here ? 
  afaik , that was the reasoning behind shipping africans to the new world . 
  yeah but you 'd think that most people would have at least some basic historic knowledge about his racial doctrine . 
  the entire african continent is inhabited by people who the nazis considered to be the scum of the earth . 
  then again , i once met a tanzanian guy who was absolutely astounded at the fact that in the winter the sun does n't come up in parts of scandinavia , or does n't go down in the summer . 
  so maybe it 's just because of my eurocentric bubble that i think these things are common knowledge . 
  it also does n't hurt that the fact that he was a bloodthirsty , fascist dictator probably becomes pretty meaningless for people living in a region that 's almost exclusively being governed by bloodthirsty , fascist dictators . 
  strid en strijd seem to be similar in meaning then . 
  i do n't know how humid your summers are , but 30 degrees is absolute hell here . 
  already at 20-25 degrees i often feel like i 'm literally about to melt . 
  while when visiting my family in southern italy i can handle anything the sun throws at me , no problem . 
  it 's so weird haha . 
  oh i can certainly understand that . 
  i was just wondering , because the guy in the article is talking about biological depression , which is a direct result from the lack of sunlight . 
   coming from the syrian desert i imagine it 's a huge cultural shock to deal with a frozen tundra . 
  i would think so too :o i remember an interview with a syrian boy who was shocked at how cold europe was , much more than anything he and his friends could have imagined . 
  and this was in august . 
  in macedonia . 
  lapland must be hell for them . 
  it 's a huge bureaucratic hassle to get welfare in the first place , exactly because people took advantage of it in the past . 
  because of the way it works , with all the rules and conditions for welfare recievers , it 's extremely easy to get stuck in a spiral of poverty and dependency on the city . 
  this new idea is , imo , an excellent way to try to stop that . 
  because with the way things currently are going , abusers of the system are often the ones in charge of it . 
  one example i can think of is a municipal worker from den haag , who had been sweeping the streets for forty years in employment of the city . 
  one day his job disappears because of austerities and he becomes unemployed and has to get welfare . 
  people who recieve welfare can be asked to do simple work , if it 's available , in order to `` earn '' their welfare . 
  this is called a tegenprestatie . 
  so this guy is also asked to perform a tegenprestatie , for the duration of his welfare . 
  now he is doing exactly the same work he did before , for basically the same employer , only for half the money . 
  and with very little change to ever get a real job again . 
  if you ask me that is just one step above actual slavery . 
  now these are rare occasions of course , but it should n't be possible in the first place . 
  do n't they have stuff like codfish oil or uv-lamps or something like that ? 
  i do n't know much about lapland , but i would have thought that a resort in the arctic , in the 21st century , has the means to battle the consquences of sunlight deprivation ?
