  the thing is though , we 've never seen him * actually * die . 
  we were just made to assume he would die . 
  so that makes people hope that he may still live . 
  also melisandre is in the neighbourhood , and she was really interested in him , so that leaves a world of possibilities . 
  it 's calabrese . 
  clearly you 've never tried to have an intelligent discussion with english students  suddenly you 'll be able to put some faces behind all those idiotic tumblr-threads ( not trying to diss that study or its students btw ; there just seems to be a disproportionate amount of people like this at studies that are very anglo-oriented ) . 
  it 's even been blowing over to the netherlands . 
  luckily these kind of people here seem to be still largely ignored/ridiculed/avoided / confined to english language studies ( * knock on wood * ) . 
  i think most people have a kind of a sour taste surrounding the whole `` you should n't offend '' hysteria . 
  what with the murders of pim fortuyn and theo van gogh ten years ago . 
  i 'm proud of you . 
  my dad used to listen to southern italian folk music all the time . 
  i actually ca n't even think of any dutch songs . 
  and since no other italians seem to want to step up i will just name a few songs i like :p [ voce ' e notte ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eouzksugsue ) [ luna rossa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dwfhyhb8qq ) [ era de maggio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8bq9ghhh28 ) [ dicitencello vuje ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-mps4owhv4 ) also , from a more recent artist ( it 's from a cd with music about the ` ndrangheta ) : [ saggi cumpagni ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhe26rixj0 ) [ ninna nanna malandrineddu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uawcy6qiky ) [ i cunfirenti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w6yih1-eus ) [ u mastru di lu sonu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtfan0_pjxg ), 
  supporting the enemy of your enemy = / = being a terrorist . 
  people throw that word around too lightly . 
  oh my god i went into this thinking that it would be a satirical video ... 
  well if no one else is going to mention it , i will . 
  my family is from naples so i feel i get to :p but the [ mandolin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hec7mqdcd2w ) of course . 
  edit : [ bonus song . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hetf_o1jycq ), 
   when i go to the toilet , i just rinse my hands off i think this goes for most people , they just answered no because the poll asked if they wash with water * and * soap . 
  did you watch the video ? 
  also , because your intelligence apparently is n't scandalously intrusive ( yet ) , surrounding countries take that as an excuse to argue why their own intelligence should be even * more * intrusive . 
  i got to say i 'd be lying if i said i did n't expect people to jump on this for their own gain . 
  come one , the number 's been growing for as long as i can remember . 
  you ca n't blame people for not always keeping up . 
  kinda looks like an [ appelflap ] ( http://www.proud2bme.nl/imgl/hsfile_53917.jpg ) . 
  no , what appeared as somewhat hyperbolic to me was - you read about terrible poverty in greece . 
  - `` oh my god there 's * poverty * in * europe * ! '', 
  - `` well , yeah , of course , there 's always been poverty in europe ... ? '', 
  - `` oh so you 're saying it 's not so bad ???? '', 
  to be honest i 'm already completely distracted from the whole article by the sheer moronicness of this line of reasoning . 
  yes ... ? 
  you realize this is exactly what happens when you hyperbolize things like this ( is that a word ... ? ) . 
  if someone tries to point out the reality , it seems in comparison as if they 're downplaying it . 
  we 're reading here about greek women having to prostitute themselves for sandwiches , and you seem stumped and frightened that there 's `` poverty in europe . 
  damn . '', 
  i am not being apathic or dismissive . 
  what i * am * being is realistic and not overly dramatic . 
  what am i , personally , going to do about this , other than reading about it and maybe commenting on it on some internet forum ? 
  or you , for that matter ? 
  there is n't ? 
  just because a situation is terrible we should lose all nuance and sense of comprehensive reading when discussing that situation ? 
   this is n't a strawman . 
  you are obviously completely dismissing the entire greek situation and eurocrash risk based on the poverty of some post staline states you 're arguing against something neither me nor the other redditor have ever said , discrediting our points by making it seem something else that is obviously absurd and untrue , while never actually adressing that which * has * been said . 
  that is the definition of a strawman phallacy . 
   i see it from there , if 20 % of europe start dying of an ebola plague you will just say `` oh the black plague was worse it killed 80 % of the pop ! '' . 
  and if even romania became worse you 'd say `` at least the camps in north korea are still worse !, 
  so it 's ok '' nice mentality there doing it again . 
  i never even stated my opinion on whether i think it is bad or not so bad . 
  mentioning the existence of secondary bad things does in no way discredit the badness of the initial bad thing . 
  and you accusing me of doing so is kind of annoying , to be honest . 
  what i 'm * trying * to do is bringing some nuance to the table . 
  what you 're doing is just spreading sensationalist untruths . 
  edit : well now you 've just gone to outright insulting . 
   widespread greek prostitution in the youth to buy themselves a daily sandwich certainly did n't happened 30 years ago . 
  it 's kind of a new low , yes , but it 's not like there 's never been any poverty in europe before this . 
  which your initial comment kind of implied . 
   so because some countries went from worse mean that the greek starting to starve is not a worrying thing nice strawman , since when was the discussion about whether or not the situation in greece is worrying ? 
  he/she mentioned a few examples of poverty in other places , to contradict your comment , which , again , kind of implies that you think there 's never been any poverty in europe before this . 
  yeah , i know . 
  but i did n't make up the title , i just wanted to keep it as the original . 
  and i think that , overall , reuters is an excellent news source , so i 'm not gon na let a crappy title keep me from posting the article . 
   and your accusation ` all talk ' makes me think that you 'd rather see the pvv should be in charge what makes you say that ? 
  the pvv is all talk too ( or shouting , really ) . 
   in gaul , the mix existed as well , forming the gallo-roman culture . 
  in britain you got the romano-british culture , and so on . 
  but would n't you rather say that that was the gauls and the britons absorbing roman culture , not the empire absorbing theirs ? 
  that 's mark rutte for you . 
  a lot of pompous statements that do n't really mean anything if you take a closer look . 
  well then maybe he should stop doing it :p, 
  the size of the actual country matters very little , really . 
  nobody is saying that . 
  i see . 
  but would n't then saying that europe should n't take in any more refugees be * helping * the germans ? 
  woops , i thought you and the other person where the same person . 
  still though , yes , he has a personal in the refugee matter in that it is happening in his country . 
  but that goes for * all * of us , not just the germans . 
  but that 's not really what i meant . 
  he , as a german , probably wo n't lose a second of sleep over whether people think that the french pm has said that we should n't take in any more refugees . 
  i know i wo n't . 
  so him pointing out that he said something else is just that . 
  him pointing it out . 
  the other guy was seeking more behind it and i found that strange . 
  so then you were both raped by each other ? 
  this is exactly the problem . 
  people who think like you . 
  please please please do n't let that shit spill over to europe any more than it has already done . 
  i actually assumed he was :o now i 'm not sure anymore ... 
  i hardly agree that it 's something students should be `` told about '' . 
  it should be alked about , certainly . 
  but in a reasonable way . 
  taking advantage of someone who is drunk , while a shitty thing to do and not something anyone should be proud of , is not even close to actual rape and claiming it is only undermines the meaning of the word . 
  getting drunk * with * a girl should n't even be in the discussion at all . 
  you are now two adults who have been drinking and who are both equally free to make decisions you might regret . 
  if you do n't want that then you either should n't drink , or appoint some sort of personal mommy/bodyguard , who 'll take care of you 24/7 . 
  ... and he will achieve that by bringing nuance to an article , by pointing out that something was wrongly translated ? 
  that 's him being in denial ? 
  in denial about what ?
