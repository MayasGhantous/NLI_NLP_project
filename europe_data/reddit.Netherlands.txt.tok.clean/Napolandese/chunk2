  i 'm just trying to tell you that nobody cares because it does n't fucking matter , and that there are no actual new victims being created . 
  those victims already exist , and not by your doing . 
  but i 'm obviously failing , seeing as you seem to think that `` its ok cause everybody does it '' is a fitting summary of what i just said . 
  do n't get me wrong , you would n't want to buy a stolen bike ? 
  then do n't . 
  i do n't care . 
  i 'm not trying to convince you to . 
  i 'm just explaining the reasoning . 
  but do n't go pretending it 's about anything else than being able to pat yourself on the back for being all moral and ethical . 
  you 're not actively creating any good . 
  you 're just not doing something . 
  yes , that 's a common thing among second-generation immigrants . 
  they often feel a strong nostalgia for the home country , even though they may have never been there ; and among muslim immigrants specifically this can manifest itself , among others , in the children becoming more fanatically ( and more conservatively ) religious . 
   and it should be for you too . 
  wow , with the high horse . 
  you do n't see * me * compelling * you * to buy one . 
  i 'm sorry man , i 'm all about being a decent person and all , but seriously ; screwing yourself over , while not actually helping anyone else , just for the * principle * of not buying `` stolen property '' , that 's just a bridge too far for me . 
   if everyone just bough stolen bikes yeah but not * everyone * does that , do they ? 
  so i do n't really see how that is relevant . 
  and yes , that 's definately part of the reason . 
  but you need to understand that it 's not really considered a big deal . 
  people in big cities mostly drive crappy , replacable bicycles anyway . 
  because t can get stolen . 
  and they know they can buy a new one for practically nothing if it does get stolen . 
  but hey , i 'm not attacking you for being so uptight . 
  i do n't appreciate being called indecent by some anonymous guy . 
  i just bought a bike from a junkie this morning . 
  because i needed it . 
  and you ca n't stop me . 
  i 'm outta ccontrol, 
  and if you do n't buy the bike , will that stop the theft ? 
  if the answer is no , you need to consider * why * exactly you refuse to buy a stolen bike . 
  will anyone be helped by you not buying it ? 
  the bike will remain stolen , you will remain bike-less , someone else will buy this bike , the bike 's original owner is still going to buy a new ( possibly stolen ) bike . 
  for the theft to stop , * everyone * should stop buying stolen bikes . 
  but this will , realistically , never happen . 
  taking the moral high ground is fine and all , but if the only consequence is you having to walk home , you should really just help yourself instead . 
  everyone else is , and it 's not like you 're doing any actual harm . 
  hey , it 's not like stolen bikes will be returned to their owners if you do n't buy them . 
  you can do nothing about that situation . 
  what you * can * do something about is the situation of you not having a bike . 
  breaking the cycle may be righteous , but it 's expensive as fuck . 
  believe me , after for the fourth time that year your bike gets stolen you just give up . 
  you 'll resort to buying stolen ones from junkies or stealing bikes yourself . 
  if those get stolen it does n't matter . 
  i read this all in [ his ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qso0duy7-9s/hqdefault.jpg ) voice . 
  yes but these ones are brown people !! 11 !, 
  and the proper name is melkbusskiet 'n  :(, 
   so cold that nordic people had to wear a t-shirt i think we may have had the same summer ... 
  `` underrated beer countries '' basically means `` countries other than belgium and germany because we do n't hear about that in the us . 
  tell me , what `` race '' are eastern europeans ? 
  for the love of everything , let 's not start saying racism to regional stereotypes/prejudice as well ... 
  well yeah , obviously . 
  but what else can they do , just let them drown ? 
  yes , that 's my experience too . 
  i think i 'll just stay in nice and cozy groningen :3, 
  ah yeah , that makes sense . 
  i guess it struck me as weird at first because that is n't my experience at all , but then again somewhat every other town here is a port town :p yeah i guess amsterdam is kind of safe . 
  at least that 's my impression . 
  i do n't live there . 
  why are port towns grittier ? 
  that must be so bizarre , seeing neo-nazi 's as an elderly person . 
  bunch of pampered little snots who glorify the assholes who caused your war trauma ( or your parents ' ) ? 
  i 'm not sure how i 'd deal with that . 
  probably something like the lady in the photograph . 
  no but this time it 's satirical . 
  look closely at the commentor who started it . 
  yeah that 's a better term . 
  ca n't you just kick out the mods doing this ? 
  on behalf of the comunity ? 
  revolution !, 
  * let 's do it with dutch as well . 
  i ` ts also right in our back yard , kind of relevant . 
   all eu member states would actually agree to that 's the thing , our own government is already rolling over like a good puppy , like they always do . 
  i guess it 's up to you guys to save us then . 
  it feels so good to be right . 
  well i am * very * sorry about that , i promise i 'll never do it again . 
  we could just swap countries . 
  all the shitty people who made the shitty countries shitty come make it shitty here , meanwhile we set up a new eu in sun-blazen africa . ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ really ^ ^ tired ^ ^ of ^ ^ the ^ ^ crappy ^ ^ wheather ^ ^ this ^ ^ year ... 
  my dad spent a summer once selling bracelets and sunglasses on the beach , in the 70 's / 80 's . 
  you 'd be surprised how many people are willing to buy nice-looking crap when they 're laying in the sun . 
  seems an ill thought out plan with an ever increasingly automated society . 
  yeah but kind of old fashioned . 
  most people just say bedrijf . 
  edit : oh , right , you 're right , in the military it 's still used . 
  it used to be called compagnie in dutch too ( --  verenigde oost-indische compagnie ), 
  i feel like the two are related . 
  because there * are * people , at least in my country , who are being pretty irrational about the whole `` hurrdurr foreigners in mah country '' thing ( people like the `` less less less morroccans '' crowd ) . 
  in reaction to this , debates about immigration have always been dominated by those who can be just as irrational and sometimes extremist , but * in favour * of the foreigners ( most extreme example i can think of would be the [ murder of pim fortuyn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assassination_of_pim_fortuyn ) ) . 
  so if you take that , and couple it with a few other factors ; such as the still lingering collective western european self loathing over the actions of our ancestors ; the anglophonic pc-hysteria that is spilling over into other countries as well ; and the fact that the current mess in the middle east is entirely the wests ' fault ( or at least a lot of people see it that way ) , and you get the current climate surrounding immigration and racism . 
  we already call it tsjechi\u00eb . 
  i 've been riding without lights in groningen for years as well , only recently got a ticket for it for the first time . 
  in my experience you only get fined if they are staking out , specifically looking for bikes without lights ( or diding around doing the same of course ) . 
  when they do they usually end up handing out fines to almost every other person , which must mean a lot of money for the city so i 'm sure that 's no coincindence :p but police cars that are doing other stuff usually do n't bother . 
  pathetic, 
  i typed exactly four sentences . 
  are you just here to try to piss people off ? 
  that 's even more pathetic . 
  not exactly common either , though . 
  why would he still be mad over a bunch of 17 ^ th century people shooting at each other ?
