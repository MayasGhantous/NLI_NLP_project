  you 're right that it can still be a woman 's own choice to wear one , but i do n't agree it 's the same kind of choice as having a career vs being a house mother . 
  the choice is between doing what your religion ( and family ) wants you to vs disobeying that . 
  i think it 's a completely different situation . 
  seriously , that most left burka just creeps the hell out of me . 
  yes . 
  they really really * really * want us to vote yes . 
  oh i did n't take it like that . 
  i do n't know man :p, 
  i just named two examples of guerilla tactics . 
  tactics that focus on damaging important locations/people/infrastructure and then going back into hiding before the ( often stronger ) enemy can retaliate . 
  tactics that have been used by various groups towards various ends throughout history . 
  by the iberians against the romans . 
  the boers against the british . 
  partizans against nazis . 
  hamas . 
  and now jihadis . 
  and i was n't the one listing anything , someone else cited a fragment from a list of every guerilla movement ever . 
  so that includes freedom fighters , separatists , * and * terrorists . 
  you 're right that they 're not connected ideologically . 
  but i do n't see how that makes it a problem for you that they 're being listed together in a list about military tactics . 
  the fact that they are n't connected ideologically is completely irrelevant . 
  i 'm not sure what exactly surfacebeneath 's point is with his strange comment , but your criticism of it is even stranger . 
  we do the same thing !, 
  because we are all still responsible for what our forefathers did , and all our actions can be adequately predicted based on it . 
  it 's more that france and belgium have never seen anything like this . 
  well if those organizations also made use of bombs and hit-and-run tactics , that 's how they can be in that list together . 
  seems pretty obvious . 
  i do n't see how the ideologies of the indivudal groups are relevant . 
  it 's exactly the same situation , only the variables are different . 
   that would defeat the object of showing that these speeches are unacceptable . 
  no it absolutely would n't . 
  arresting the imam would show that these speeches are unacceptable . 
  closing the mosque would upset the entire muslim community ( i do n't how many mosques there are in glasgow , i imagine one ? ) . 
  `` gee , some of these muslims sure are angry at us . 
  instead of targeting those people specifically , let 's antagonize the rest of them as well , that wo n't cause any problems . 
  after all , doing anything less would defeat the objective of showing that these speeches are unacceptable . '', 
   it does not hit home that if such hate speech is allowed in a place of god then that place can no longer be respected as a place of god ... because hate speech is something that god does n't want you to do ? 
  i can see how people might ^ ( want to ? ), 
  interpret that as generally inciting hatred . 
  but if we 're being pedantic he did n't say anything wrong , did he ? 
  the attackers were bastards . 
  and they most probably where islamic . 
  there 's a huge difference between `` islamic bastards '' or '' * those * islamic bastards '' . 
  edit : alright yeah no now that i saw his other tweets as well , the guy 's an idiot . 
  yes they are . 
  they are all jewish . 
  that 's how it works . 
  where they live does n't matter . 
  jewish people have traditionally always been very isolasionist , with young people preferably marrying other jewish people . 
  there are of course people who just marry whoever they want , especially in modern times . 
  but such families , that are increasingly partially descended from jews , usually stop calling themselves jewish after two or three generations . 
  my point is that the jewish religion and the jewish people are two separate things . 
  there are plenty of jews who do n't practice , and anti-semites still hate them . 
  you think the nazis only rounded up jews who went to the synagogue ? 
  it has n't been a religious issue for centuries . 
  whereas muslims are not a people . 
  they are not an ethnicity . 
  they are just people who follow the teachings of mohamed . 
  when people are hateful about islam , it 's not a racial issue . 
  people who hate muslims do n't hate brown people . 
  they have prejudices against the religion ( sure people sometimes get the two mixed up , both in the `` anti-islam '' camp and the `` anti-islamophobia '' camp . 
  because morons are always and everywhere ) . 
  i know arabs who would have been called racist or `` islamophobe '' for the things they say , had they been white . 
  because they detest the suppressive religiousness around them . 
  but had they been white , they would have to permanently be wary of being called racist , or islamophobic , or being compared to anti-semites . 
  they are not the same thing , and claiming they are is harmful and exactly what the extremists want . 
  because jews are an ethnicity . 
  muslims and christians are n't . 
  or atheists about christians . 
  both these examples are not the same thing as hating jews . 
  yeah but fifa only needed to throw money at the right people . 
  maybe now that that 's not a factor it can be slightly different ? 
  maybe ? 
  i 'm just describing what i see . 
  i 'm not defending anyone , i 'm just laying out plainly for you , based on what i know about it , why i think what you 're saying is bullshit . 
  and meanwhile you just keep on calling names . 
  there are lots of people in this thread poking fun at it . 
  thing is , they keep it at that . 
  they do n't turn it into an argument about the inherent sexism of it , or the perviness of heteros . 
  that annoys people . 
  also nobody is upset that you have that opinion . 
  but then , in the face of people telling you why it is n't that way , you keep insisting that in fact it is . 
  that annoys people . 
  what makes you think i 'm offended ? 
  i 'm just breaking down why your opinion is ridiculous . 
  ^ ^ ^ hahaha ^ ^ ^ come ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ dude ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ both ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ complains ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ non-existent ^ ^ ^ sexism ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ calls ^ ^ ^ other ^ ^ ^ people ^ ^ ^ tumblarina . 
  ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ pick ^ ^ ^ one, 
  well from what i gather it 's traditionally supposed to be an egg , but a lot of adult women go for booze and chocolate . 
  you 're making it sound like they 're being forced . 
  mmm no i do n't agree . 
  there 's a clear distinction between feeling offended about something , or insulting someone . 
  in the first thing , the offender is passive . 
  in the latter , they are actively trying to provoke/hurt/anger / upset someone . 
  they are two completely different things . 
  i feel kind of weird that i have to give a lesson about english words to an english person . 
  please do n't turn it around on me , it 's quite childish . 
  i think that from my earlier comment about `` pc '' it 's pretty clear that i do n't give a crap about that . 
  of course it 's weird . 
  everyone thinks it weird . 
  that 's why op started this freaking thread .
