  the problem is that there does n't seem to be any meaningful active response as of yet . 
   they were suggesting that women be careful `` we think there will be rapists on the loose again , please be careful ! '', 
  seems like pretty sound advice if you ask me ... 
  `` society is like a stew . 
  if you do n't stir it up every once in a while then a layer of scum floats to the top . '', 
  - edward abbey seriously though , the more i read about this the more i 'm convinced shit is going to hit the fan sooner rather than later . 
  i can imagine for example that at least all the still existing groups of neo nazis all over europe are n't going to stand for this much longer . 
  that would be truly ironic , if it would have to come to that ... that * they * would have to be the ones taking the initiative to change things . 
  then we 'd have come full circle . 
  what the hell d :, 
  he did , because that 's what happened . 
  the three followed her out of the train , leaving the rest behind . 
  yeah kind of i guess . 
  though i would think you still pay * some * form of taxes . 
  if only when just doing groceries . 
  sarcastically doing the same shitty thing as others is not really helping either . 
  it 's possible in uk and sweden to not pay taxes ? 
  then how are those famous scandinavian social services financed , if people do n't have to pay taxes ? 
  so your solution is to * join * the retarded lines of reasoning , instead of trying call others out on it in an effort to battle it ? 
  or something like that ? 
   especially when you do n't have to pay any taxes and can live your life on other people 's back through state handouts well people should do more research before leaving then because this is n't possible anywhere . 
  are people now apologists for reminding everyone of the actual acts ? 
  he 's also ranted a good deal about kapitalism , represented by the british empire . 
  are dutch people known for being nitpicky ... ? 
  yeah but ,  saddam was basically a fascist ** but ** assad and especially gaddafi did a lot to develop their countries i know that i 'm bing extremely nitpicky here , but that 's a strange sentence . 
  being a fascist does n't automatically makes you bad at governing a country . 
  it just makes you undemocratic . 
  one of the main fetishes of every fascist is their own country and people . 
  on the other hand , genocide and ethnic cleansing are hardly standard ingredients of fascism . 
  that was just hitler who added that to his particular version of it . 
  edit : i just now realized that it seems like i 'm defending fascism here . 
  i 'm not , i 'm genuinely just being difficult about your choice of words :p, 
   saddam was basically a fascist but assad and especially gaddafi did a lot to develop their countries implying that fascists do n't develop their countries ? 
  iirc , there where a number of people hitler accused of oppressing and screwing over the german people , or threatening the purity of their `` race '' . 
  jews , communists and the british were among the main culprits if i 'm not mistaken . 
   more generally , the french government seized `` emergency powers '' in the wake of the paris attack nobody is surprised about this . 
  in fact , many people * predicted * that his very thing would happen . 
  things like this have increasingly been going on throughout western europe and were actually somewhat of a hot topic on many news sites and forums before the paris attacks . 
  that people have been distracted by islamist violence is hardly an argument that they do n't care about it anymore . 
  also ,  he was convicted by a belgian court `` for racist and anti-semitic comments he made during a show in belgium '' and was given a two month prison term tells us nothing without mentioning the actual things he said . 
  for all we know his comments were * actually * that . 
  could have been meant ironic , could have been genuine . 
  why does n't the author provide some context ? 
  because slander still is n't permitted , even within the context of free speech . 
  let 's not forget that our own geert wilders has gotten himself in similar trouble for saying terrible things about muslims and foreigners . 
  also , comparing antisemitism to `` anti islam '' - ism is just plain wrong . 
  muslims are n't an ethnicity , as jews are . 
  hate against jews ** is ** racism . 
  hate against muslims can be many things , but never racism . 
  for the law it 's the same thing as hate or prejudices against christians/christianity by atheists , which nobody ever bats an eye about . 
  that 's because in that case there are no foreigners involved , so it 's less confusing for simple people . 
  i could go on and on tearing this article to shreds , even if it may contain a core of truth , but i do n't want this to turn into a novel . 
  let 's just say that this author uses the same low little tricks in his argumentation as he accuses others of using . 
  but the men all being bigger and stronger than you * does * make the situation that extra bit terrifying , i imagine . 
  do n't get me wrong , i think things will have to change if we 're not going to get wild west vigilante scenarios , i just do n't think they will any time soon . 
  obviously eventually they will , but if our politicians ' current response time to crises is any indication it will be too late . 
   hard line differences between the groups we 'd call liberal or conservative we 'd call that progressive vs conservative . 
  liberal is a mostly economical term here , referring to parties that are centre-right . 
  neoliberalism would technically be the correct term i think . 
  you are commenting on an article that tells about how the police president is being held accountable , while another article in this sub tells us that merkel wants to make deportation of criminals `` faster '' , while that is comepletely meaningless if there is no deportation to begin with . 
  nothing will change . 
  they despise us because they are not us !, 
   bathtub cheese i thought you were going in a completely different , way more disgusting direction with that :p, 
  [ it 's business !, 
  ] ( http://imgfave-herokuapp-com.global.ssl.fastly.net/image_cache/1354500863459983.jpg ), 
  you 're exactly right , and it 's called positive discrimination . 
  and it 's becoming more and more common . 
  that 's also not what i 'm saying ( i was n't even the one who brought this up in the first place , i just jumped into the discussion , trying to prevent the other redditor from ripping something out of context ) . 
  i 'm not saying all refugees are rapists in waiting , i 'm not even talking about all refugees . 
  i 'm talking about * these * men , who are said to have been middle eastern looking and hardly spoke english or german . 
  so until i get any information to the contrary , i 'm going to assume that they were mostly refugees , and i think we can say that at least these refugees * were * rapists in waiting . 
  and i think we ` de be fools to try to deny that their cultural background plays any role in their behaviour . 
  anyway , i agree that i do n't think it will help contructively because it is not extremely relevant for the matter at hand , which is finding the perpetrators and finding a way to prevent this from happening in the future . 
  but seeboar took a comment from a comment thread that was specifically talking about the cultural attitudes towards women and non-believers in many middle eastern countries , and claimed it was defending the perpetrators somehow . 
  and i was foolish enough to repond to him . 
  that 's how this tumor of a thread was born ... 
  welp , i tried . 
  i tried to clarify it for you and now i 'm a racist . 
  that 's fine . 
   i never knew you were so racist well how could you ? 
  you do n't know me . 
  i never knew you were such a fucking retard . 
  though i should have already known from the first two comments were you kept insisting i was making excuses , but i just thought you were n't too bright . 
  i remained patient . 
  i tried to convey an extremely simple logical principle to you . 
  and then you went from `` stop defending them '' to `` you 're a racist '' . 
  apparently this concept is too complicated for you . 
  that 's fine . 
  i really fail to see how i 'm saying anything in their defense . 
  coming from a medieval society is not an excuse to commit crimes in my book . 
  i also do n't see how anything what i said is racist . 
  are you * denying * that these people come from cultures with ... problematic attitudes towards women and non-believers ? 
  that they are now walking around in countries filled with non-believing women ? 
  that the men who did this have shown that * they * did n't come here for our nice western ideals , but simply because they did n't want to be enslaved by isis ? 
  that they have shown that people were right to fear things would go wrong ? 
  kinda has a ring to it . 
   i meant on muslim believers . 
  i know you did . 
  but i think that getting killed trumps knowing that someone , somewhere drew a forbidden picture of your prophet . 
   what is the difference ?
