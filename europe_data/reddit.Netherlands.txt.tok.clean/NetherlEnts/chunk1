do you have a source for that ? 
  i agree . 
  also what 's up with the `` lady gaga ocean '' ? 
  it 's a joke . 
  in dutch `` vowel '' is `` klinker '' . 
  the word klinker is also used for [ this type of paving ] ( http://www.tuinkei.nl/uploads/gebakken_klinker.jpg ) . 
  `` zandweg '' means dirt road , in other words a road without klinkers ( the type of paving ) . 
  we also learn french and english ( and latin and old greek ) in hs though . 
  not really . 
  i have heard that dutch has far more . 
  and a word of seven letters without any vowels !, 
  zandweg, 
  well and in return there are americans who tell me `` the netherlands ? 
  is n't that the name of michael jacksons ranch ? '', 
  just keep in mind that there are ignorant people on both sides of the pond . 
  the ones that spout these things are often also the ones you should n't be listening or talking to . 
  ofcourse i also like to take a jab at my american friends , but all in the spirit of good banter . 
  just brush it off as either a joke or a stupid person and so either way not worth taking seriously . 
  ( that does n't matter that you should dismiss any criticisms as `` just another jealous european guy '' though !, 
  well formulated opinions are always worth taking into account , even if they go against what you believe ) oh and the times i 've been called irrelevant and poor by americans over the internet could n't be counted on two hands . 
  nor the times they assured me that our nato partner could level us with nukes if they wanted to . 
  ( jokes on them , we 're already leveled  ) anyway , i 'm rambling . 
  have a nice day . 
  well as a western european i can tell you i 'd be hard-pressed to find someone who actually hates americans/actively goes out of their way to treat americans like shit . 
  sure , most people here can be quite vocal in their criticisms but you have to understand that we do this to ourselves and eachother as well . 
  just because somebody tells you that the us was wrong to invade iraq and that they think american politics today is bullshit does n't mean they have anything against americans . 
  the only place where i 've seen americans treated like shit was in south america . 
  i 've had a variety of pets in the 19 years that i lived with my parents ( parakeets , rabbits , cats , fish ) but now that i live on my own i do n't . 
  i really want a dog though and plan on getting one as soon as i got the money , space and time to properly take care of one . 
  i bet among football fans they are !, 
  and they have to eat american apples ? 
   grocery store shelves i do n't think us soldiers on duty in estonia do their shopping at regular grocery stores to be honest . 
  can you back this up with some examples ? 
  i always found the dutch news to be quite good . 
  [ that already existed before !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_netherland ), 
  and make sure norway and switzerland never join !, 
  they are good competition in most areas , too . 
  i know , but that does n't mean it 's cheaper to import them . 
  if we ignore mispresentation of fact , most people who travel to poorer countries do so to broaden their horizon and for the adventure . 
  i know i do . 
  a ship is safe in the harbour , but that 's not what ships are made for . 
  you call him crazy , i call him dedicated and brave !, 
  almost no apples are imported to the eu from the us . 
  most of them are grown here in europe . 
  what do they have to do with apples ? 
  the funniest one to me is wanting to boycott all drug producing countries ( nl is up there in xtc production ), 
  just fyi : it is pronounced similar to `` layved '', 
  same the other way around !, 
  what 's a `` car '' ? 
  ** the netherlands ** - people found some [ 70 discarded barrels ] ( http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/3750733/tientallen-vaten-met-xtc-afval-gedumpt-in-tilburg-en-riel.html ) with chemicals , presumably originating from an xtc-lab . 
  we are huge in xtc , even more so than in marijuana . 
  i 've been told that our # 1 export is xtc . 
  - according to a survey , [ doctors in the netherlands have become more careful when it comes to euthanesia ] ( http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/3749825/veel-artsen-terughoudender-met-euthanasie.html ) following the suicide of a doctor who was accused of murder after he broke the laws surrounding euthanesia . 
  he administered * one hundred * times the legal dose of morhpine to a patient . 
  - people are getting outraged over a reporter who threw a beer bottle to a boat with handicapped people . 
  nobody got hurt and the reported has been dragging himself through the dust apologizing . 
  i myself could n't care less about stuff like this so this is all i know . 
  - since saturday it is possible to get a new high speed train from amsterdam to lille ( france ) . 
  the trip will [ take you but two hours and a half ] ( http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/3750245/nieuwe-snelle-treinverbinding-amsterdam-lille.html ) i bet there 's another dutchman on here who can fill you in on the political events of this week . 
  i have n't had the time to follow it myself this week so i wo n't pretend to know anything about what happened . 
   people dutch provinces like drenthe and groningen also make less . 
  but , apparently less murder . 
  alledgedly groningen has the lowest crime rate of any city in europe ( disclaimer : hearsay ), 
  can confirm , no trouble seeing the stars here in groningen, 
  we have the shortest average work week in the eu at 30,6 hours a week . 
  compare to a eu average of 36,5 hours a week , or a north-american average of between 44 and 52 hours a week !, 
  this means that the average dutchie works 697 hours per ~ ~ week ~ ~ year less than the average american and over 300 hours less than the average eu citizen . 
  in other words the 21 days of working/21 days of living divide is wrong for the netherlands . 
  i know but how is that relevant to a contemporary pro-seccesion movement ? 
  ( which , as far as i know , does n't exist in any serious way in friesland ) the frisian kingdom ( which is what i think that map is based on ) has been gone since the year 734 so i really do n't see why they would include groningen in an independent frisian state . 
  the washington post says this happened in hotel huis ter duin , but the hotel [ denies it happened ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/628292-huis-ter-duin-boos-op-wton-post.html ) to quote from the article :  `` the american delegation consisted of 500 guests of which we 250 were housed in huis ter duin . 
  we did not have an incident like the one described by the press '' , says director stokkermans . 
  `` as a matter of face , the people that we have hosted were very disciplined , attentive and displayed a very different sort of behaviour . '', 
  is there more support in flanders for an own state or to join the netherlands ? 
  why is groningen included in frisia ? 
  there 's quite a bit of rivalry between groningen and friesland and i doubt there are many groningers who would want to 1 ) split away from the netherlands and 2 ) even if they did i doubt they 'd want an union with friesland . 
  obama 's entry is the norm ? 
  really ? 
  i doubt there are many leaders that arrive by ~ ~ one ~ ~ ~ ~ two ~ ~ ~ ~ three ~ ~ ~ ~ four ~ ~ five helicopters . 
  obviously cycling is not the norm for leaders , but nor is obama 's grand entry . 
  do you know where/when it was taken ? 
  ( edit : what i 'm actually asking is , how do you know it was not taken at the nss ), 
  [ cycling is not out of the norm here ] ( http://www.streetfilms.org/groningen-the-worlds-cycling-city/#more-56291 ), 
  [ seperate parts of the city just for cyclist !, 
  ] ( http://www.streetfilms.org/groningen-the-worlds-cycling-city/#more-56291 ), 
  ha , yes . 
  sleet really fucks you over . 
  especially when you 're also impaired due to alcohol . 
  i got some battle scars to prove this is not a good combination . 
  i know this is anecdotal , but i have never ever heard of somebody dying in a bike accident that did n't involve a collision with a car . 
   traffic here is so accustomed and geared towards bicyclists [ not only that , entire cities are shaped in order to accustom bikes ] ( http://www.streetfilms.org/groningen-the-worlds-cycling-city/#more-56291 ), 
  i would say de volkskrant is second only to nrc handelsblad . 
  then again i 'm kinda leftist leaning so i guess i may be biased . 
  a lot of dutch people reacted the same way to this . 
  remove krulbroodje you are worst krulbroodje . 
  you are thek rulbroodje idiot you are the krulbroodje smell . 
  return to france to our francecousins you may come our contry . 
  you may live in the zoo ... . ahahahaha , wallonia we will never forgeve you .
