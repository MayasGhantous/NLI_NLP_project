  kaasland greattst countrey, 
   i honestly fail to see why the reaction in case of a smaller nato member like latvia would be any different ukraine is not a member of nato . 
  actually , article v * does * state that the nato members promise to assist any of the other members in case of an attack . 
   the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that , if such an armed attack occurs , each of them , in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by article 51 of the charter of the united nations , ** will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action as it deems necessary ** , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . 
  ( emphasis mine ) the budapest memorandum , as you say , does * not * oblige the signatories to take action . 
  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/01/4a8078449e794dfb8cc33add00a6f1af.gif edit : as for your second question : you are misrepresenting the 1994 agreement , either out of ignorance or intentionally . 
  the 1994 agreement does n't say that they will guarantee ukraine 's borders but merely that the signees would * respect their sovereignity * . 
  this means that the us , uk , etc. 
  agreed that they would not invade ukraine . 
  did they ? 
  so they have n't broken the agreement . 
  whoa whoa whoa ... you mean to tell me russia invaded a nato country in 2008 and i did n't know about it ? 
  i 'm not saying that russia is n't playing a dangerous game . 
  i 'm saying that people are overstating the danger . 
  i very much doubt they will be invading a nato country any time soon . 
  because they are not stupid enough to pick a fight with nato ? 
  give me a reason why they would that is n't `` they invaded crimea ! '', 
  actually the choice to make cycling popular in the netherlands was a conscious one , made somewhere in the '50s if i 'm not mistaken . 
  you can learn more about it from [ this video ] ( http://vimeo.com/76207227 ) . 
  it is scaremongering to think that because they have invaded crimea they will now also start invading all the other countries around them . 
  there is no reason to believe they will . 
  that does n't mean it 's not scaremongering though . 
  i think the minister is angry that they used a masterpiece for their commercial advertisement rather than because they depicted him with a weapon . 
  * the people with the stolen passports on the missing plane were on their way to amsterdam . 
  do n't panic my friend , there is some authentic [ dutch freedom ] ( http://www.key.aero/central/images/gallery/6764.jpg ) coming your way !, 
  [ be on the look-out ] ( http://media.dumpert.nl/foto/c82f1aeb_screen_capture_16.jpg ) . 
  according to the 2012 book * towards a worldwide index of human freedom * , dutch freedom is [ second only to new zealand ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rp1fimo.png ) so i would say we 're doing pretty good without american freedom actually . 
  google the title and click the first link ( a pdf ) and you will find a complete overview on page 75 . 
  [ i think we 're good for the next couple of years ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groningen_gas_field ), 
  it may very well be . 
  i just saw an opportunity to post the joke that i stole from [ bill maher ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yks0yisz6xq ) . 
  i thought it came from the fact that the french refused to get on board with americas well planned and wonderfully executed war in iraq .

  [ ahmed aboutaleb , major of rotterdam , wrote an open letter to the people who sent the death threats ] ( http://www.metronieuws.nl/columns/brief-aan-anonieme-bedreiger/srznbl!8kdffwkndvgma/ ) . 
  translated : `` dear anonymous online threatener , you do n't know her , you 've never met her . 
  still you have ridiculed , mocked and even threatened a rotterdam entrepeneur for opening a wine bar . 
  apparently you do not agree with her choice and wanted to give her your honest opinion . 
  this went from bad to worse . 
  the police even had to be called in . 
  where do you get the nerve to scare somebody like that ? 
  this contributes nothing for your children , your family or society . 
  all your cowardly behaviour shows is that you do not understand the rules . 
  and you are n't the only one . 
  posting hurtful , threatening comments on social media appears to be the national sport sometimes . 
  the rule in this country is that everybody is free to make their own decisions in life . 
  these choices deserve to be respected , even though we do not always agree with them . 
  if you can not give this respect , you can not ask to be respected either . 
  that is how easy it is . 
  compare it to sport . 
  a fair game can only be played if everybody plays by the rules . 
  anonymous shitflinging is something that puts you completely offside if you ask me and it does n't earn you any respect . 
  luckily the democratic rule of law protects these rules . 
  this ensures that citizens are protected and feel safe to be whoever they want to be . 
  the next time you crawl back behind your keyboard , take the following rule in mind . 
  a rule that is centuries old and is seen in all cultures : treat others the way you want to be treated . 
  ahmed aboutaleb '', 
  yes . 
  springsteen however is another story . 
  funfact : springsteen means `` jumping stone '' in dutch . 
  i did n't mean to offend you , i 'm sorry if i did . 
  i like hearing that you have such a close relationship with the netherlands which you seem to cherish . 
  i think i may have expressed myself unclearly . 
  when i say i am indifferent of dutch diaspora i do n't mean that all of them could vanish off the face of the planet for all i care , i just mean that i do n't care for them any more or less than i do other people . 
  i love meeting people with dutch roots , i like telling them about the netherlands , etc. 
  i just do n't base my opinion of them on the fact that they happen to have dutch roots . 
  if you 're likeable , i will like you . 
  if you 're an asshole , i will not . 
  also i detest generalizing so i do n't have an opinion on the entirety of dutch diaspora . 
  i really do n't care if they do though , i think it 's nice that they want to find out more about their family 's history or about the netherlands in general . 
  i do n't see why some people define themselves entirely based on having 1/xth heritage from some country or another . 
  is n't that paris ? 
  i am profoundly indifferent of dutch diaspora . 
  i would say that the fact that van gogh is one of the most famous painters in history made that painting famous . 
  absinthe is a pretty niche interest . 
  i agree , there should be atleast one [ de stijl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_stijl ) painting in a list of most popular dutch paintings . 
  are you implying that absinthe made this painting famous ? 
  sounds like crooked logic to me . 
  [ click ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/girl_with_a_pearl_earring ), 
  i love escher but i would n't call this the most popular painting . 
  in the first place because it 's not a painting , and escher is n't a painter . 
  i was gon na say de nachtwacht or [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/vincent_willem_van_gogh_128.jpg ) . 
  it 's called the [ free rider problem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_rider_problem ) . 
  rational actors in a group want to enjoy maximum benefits whilst contributing as little as possible . 
  he only added flair after i asked . 
  when i asked there was no flag . 
  probably a case of confirmation bias . 
   while others would find it horribly offensive sure  and racist . 
  it 's stereotypical , it is in bad taste , it might be offending . 
  it is , however , not racist . 
  racism , atleast to me , means the idea that one race of people is better than another . 
  for this same reason i have never understood the whole ordeal around zwarte piet either . 
  in this age of global interconnectedness , the minute the news from belgium broke this discussion could 've taken place anywhere in the world .
