  where is `` here '' ? 
  this is the funniest news story i 've read all week . 
  glad they did not get hurt though , this could 've ended way differently . 
   ( or the netherlands if you will ) holland is not a country . 
  there 's no `` willing '' or `` unwilling '' here , simply right and wrong . 
  thanks for the flattering words about our country !, 
   it does n't , but often europeans tend to infer they 're beyond racism . 
  this , ofcourse , is a claim europeans should n't dare make . 
  any european who says there is no racism in europe is either lying or ignorant . 
  that being said , i think this stems from a differing idea of what racism is on the two continents . 
  here in the netherlands many things are not considered racism , whereas they would be considered racist in the us . 
  jokes , for example , would n't be called racist here . 
  they would be considered in poor taste , offensive or a * faux pas * , but they would usually not be considered racist . 
   granted it is anecdotal , but in my experience it seems americans tend to be less racist than europeans . 
  even during a severe economic downturn , 73 % of americans view immigration as a net benefit to the country . 
  most of these immigrants are not white . 
  europeans have problems with * illegal * immigration , usually . 
  yes , because one president getting fined for saying gypsies do n't work and steal automatically means that us people are not racist . 
  [ dutch spoken in the netherlands is also just a collection of dialects , even more than flemish ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/languages_benelux.png ) . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're being serious ... 
  you sound like we 're just gon na drain the entire thing overnight . 
  obviously losing the port would have tremendous consequences . 
  however , draining the sea is a huge project and would take years , creating tons of new jobs . 
  obviously i know that this idea would be fatal to the dutch economy , i was just kidding in my initial post . 
  ( hence the ''  '' ), 
  well i guess we 'd be the ones hired to drain the north sea , so if we just make sure to charge enough it 'd boost our economy , 
  that 's us !, 
  it 's a joke , man . 
  lighten up . 
  then why is n't lisboa called lisboa ? 
  similarly i feel like a tourist when i go to the randstad , whereas i do n't have this feeling when i visit other cities outside the randstad . 
  is it related to fierljeppen ? 
  what 's a `` soccer '' ... ? 
  in my experience we get mixed up with denmark a lot . 
  also some people do n't even know that amsterdam is our capital but instead think that amsterdam is a seperate country . 
  `` hup nederland hup ! '', 
  does n't sound quite as nice !, 
  well my english is not that bad !, 
  truly eye opening . 
  thanks for posting this , op . 
  in dutch we do n't have the `` th '' sound , this is another reason why i prefer saying holland to the netherlands when i speak english . 
  the `` th '' is a bitch to pronounce . 
  i know several people who would take offense if you called the netherlands holland . 
  i 'm not one of them . 
  i 've grown so used to people calling my country holland that i 've started doing it myself when i 'm speaking in another language than dutch . 
  netherlands * jeroen dijsselbloem ( pvda ) , our minister of finances , was [ named `` politician of the year '' .

  i think you misunderstand the nature of international laws . 
  the owner of the company was thinking about hiring the guy when he got the email from an employee . 
  the owner said the employee that sent the mail will be punished but also that he does n't know what the punishment would be , because `` what would be an adequate measure ? 
  neger is equal to negro in english . 
  it 's not a slur but people will look at you weird when you use the word to describe a person . 
  i am not a fan of gordon at all , but distasteful jokes do not equal racism . 
  racism would imply that he believes that ( in this case ) chinese people are inherently inferior to him . 
  he did not say or imply this , he just made some offensive jokes , stereotyping asians . 
  they were in bad taste and should n't be made , but i would n't say it 's racist . 
  thanks for the correction !, 
  netherlands - we turned 200 yesterday , hurrah !, 
  - we found out that our nsa ( called aivd ) is cracking servers of internetfora to collect data of users . 
  mostly jihadist websites . 
  - s&p downgraded us from aaa to aa, 
  there are several bars in groningen that have n't closed in years . 
  some more cool facts about groningen : it is the [ happiest city in europe ] ( http://www.nu.nl/lifestyle/3596654/groningen-lijkt-gelukkigste-stad-van-europa.html ) lowest average age of any city in the netherlands ( 25 % of all inhabitants are students and [ 15,9 % of all people are between 20 and 25 years old ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/groningen_%28stad%29#bevolking ) ) . 
  lowest crime rate of any city in europe . 
  ( admittedly , this is hearsay . 
  no source ) the [ largest bar in europe ] ( http://www.driegezustersgroningen.nl/ ) is located here amazing infrastructure for bikes , [ other dutch cities look at groningen when designing their streets ] ( http://vimeo.com/76207227 ), 
  whoops , read too quickly . 
  my bad . 
  next time you need to place the baltics on a map just remember that their names are alphabetical from north to south !, 
  netherlands too , except the grocery thing and the smiling . 
  i get the feeling many people will see this as a bad thing , but try to understand . 
  these people will drink beer either way . 
  this way they 1 ) stop being disruptive and troublesome 2 ) get a pay and a warm meal every day 3 ) do something useful for the city 4 ) get some purpose and structure in their lives . 
   [ project participants also say they are happy to be there , all taking part voluntarily . 
  ] ( http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/dutch-news/amsterdam-pays-alcoholics-in-beer-to-clean-streets_278809.html )  `` it gives our lives some structure '' said one alcoholic who asked not to be named . 
   `` lots of us have n't had any structure in our lives for years , we just do n't know what it is , and so this is good for us , '' said frank . 
  i agree that at first it seems like amsterdam is taking advantage of these poor alcoholics for their own gain , but in reality this is helping them . 
  it keeps them from doing illegal things to obtain the beer . 
  plus , the dutch government [ runs treatment centres for alcohol abuse ] ( http://www.stap.nl/en/home/dutch-alcohol-policy.html ) . 
  literally everyone is better off this way and nobody is getting harmed . 
  this is all wrong . 
  the santa claus character you know was formed in the 1800s in the us . 
  it was a mix of many northern european characters from pagan traditionsm including ( but not limited to ! ), 
  sinterklaas , father christmas and other elves and gods . 
  you can see this in the santa claus character has . 
  santa claus itself is an americanization of sinterklaas , but he 's also known as kris kringle , father christmas and saint nick . 
  in europe these were different characters , but in the us over time they blended into one . 
  santa claus . 
  you can actually see this happening in the older stories . 
  the poem `` the night before christmas '' came out in 1823 in new york , it established that santa lands on the roof and fills stockings with toys . 
  but this santa is an elf , much like in nordic mid-winter traditions . 
  he 's small , rides a miniature sled pulled by reindeer . 
  the name santa appears nowhere in the poem . 
  the character is called st. nick . 
  during the 1800s a fat , human looking , immortal santa evolved into the standard among american authors .
