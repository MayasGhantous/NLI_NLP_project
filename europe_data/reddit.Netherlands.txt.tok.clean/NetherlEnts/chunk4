  around 1900 santa had developed into his current , iconic style . 
  contrary to popular belief coca-cola did n't `` invent '' the current santa , instead they used the conveniently red and white santa in their corporate scheme in 1931 to help sell more soda during the off-season . 
  they did n't create him but probably did brandish him as the one , true santa . 
  [ see this video for more explanation ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbuvkxdu4lq ) ( most of this post was a paraphrasation of some of this video ), 
  `` let me tell you about your country ! '', 
  you 're wrong . 
  christmas = christ 's nameday . 
  unless you 're saying sinterklaas = jesus you 're wrong . 
   i 'll be amazed if anything useful comes from this investigation . 
  the part that actually bugs me most is how serious people take it . 
  1 ) she has n't even done research yet and already gave her personal opinion 2 ) whilst she is supposed to be an impartial agent of the un she has stated her ** personal ** opinion to the press and is pushing the netherlands to comform to it , and the best part is 3 ) the un resolutions are non-binding and the un is n't a higher authority than the dutch government ( anarachism in international system , state sovereignity , all that jazz ) so no matter what she says , we do n't have to listen . 
  and that is exactly why i think it should n't be changed again , 
  learn something every day , right ? 
  i fully agree with you that this line goes too far . 
  however , children can be way more cruel than that and think of way more racist things . 
  when i was about 8 years me and my friends would go around singing `` zie de maan schijnt door de tralies , zwarte piet is illegaal '' . 
  despite not having a clue what the fuck we were actually saying . 
  i wo n't post the rest of the song because i 'm ashamed that i still know the lines . 
  the relics of saint nicholas were transported to bari , italy . 
  for this reason he is known as nicholas of bari . 
  bari later was a part of the kingdom of spain ( conquered in 1442 by alfonso of aragon ) . 
  the city remained spanish until the 18th century . 
  but when are stereotypical characteristics racist ? 
  how is a black figure with curly hair and big lips establishing him as inferior ? 
   but it 's highly likely that the whole ` black slave working for an old white guy ' concept was conceived in a racist mindset . 
  of course it was . 
  judging from zwarte piet 's outfit he is a page . 
  black pages were often used for `` decoration '' , hence the flashy outfit and the huge golden earrings . 
  the current depiction however does not in any way lead children to belief that he 's a slave , or inferior to sinterklaas . 
   it 's a mistake of the past but it should n't be banned . 
  exactly !, 
  as i said , changing it would be lying to ourselves . 
  acting as if slavery never happened . 
  i do n't think his depiction is racist . 
  it 's stereotypical , that 's for sure , but stereotypes are n't racist by definition . 
  racism , after all , is the belief that races can be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to others , or that members of different races should be treated differently . 
  depicting zwarte piet with stereotypical features such as thick , red lips and curly hair does n't make it racist . 
  nobody is establishing superiority or inferiority , just like saying that dutch people are tall and like cheese is stereotypical , but not racist . 
  that being said , i agree with the rest of your post . 
  zwarte piet is a happy figure . 
  he makes children laugh , and gives them candy and presents . 
  the idea that using a black figure as a servant or helper of a white figure somehow promotes racism , slavery , or whatever is , in my eyes , nonsensical . 
  sinterklaas is an old tradition and he has had black servants for a long time . 
  this simply happened in the past and changing zwarte piet now would not be `` politically correct '' , it would be historically inaccurate . 
  it would be denying our past . 
  it would be lying to ourselves . 
  surely we can acknowledge that in the past white people had black servants , and portray this in a neutral way ( such as zwarte piet ) without automatically promoting or endorsing racism and slavery ? 
  zwarte piet is funny , acrobatic , jolly and kind . 
  he also gives candy ** and ** presents . 
  the only thing even remotely racist about the character is the way he is depicted . 
  i personally do n't think the way he is depicted is racist ( it is stereotypical , sure , but stereotypes are n't necessarily racist ) but i can see why some people would . 
  if he was going to jail he would 've been there already !, 
  in dutch tradition naughty kids get kicked and beaten with a switch , before being abducted and taken to spain on sinterklaas ' ( not santa ! ), 
  two videos this question made me think of : 1 : [ david sedaris - six to eight black men ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nydpte1w0vk ) david sedaris explains in eloquent and hilarious manner what zwarte piet and sinterklaas are to an american audience . 
  absolutely worth the 15 minutes , but if you do n't have the time for that , the part about zp starts at around 3:50 . 
  2 : [ a brief history of santa ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbuvkxdu4lq ) exactly as the title suggests , a brief history of santa . 
  cpggrey explains how several european pagan traditions ( including sinterklaas ) transformed into the american santa claus . 
  can confirm that we do three !, 
  also , you can find a similar thing for denmark ( and pretty much all other countries ) on ediplomat . 
  [ here is the dutch one ] ( http://www.ediplomat.com/np/cultural_etiquette/ce_nl.htm ) . 
  emma is very common in the netherlands . 
  it is originally a germanic name . 
  why does gelderland get it 's own flair but not groningen ? 
  well i 'm obviously biased , and i ca n't really judge about the other cities since groningen is the only studentenstad i 've studied in . 
  i would , however , definitely recommend studying here . 
  groningers are very pleasant people , the level of education is high , and the city has a lot to offer . 
  being nearby the waddenislands makes for great opportunities for day - or weekendtrips in summer , and the atmosphere in the city itself is very `` gezellig '' . 
  edit : and not to mention ; very low housing costs compared to other cities . 
  i would like to leave you with this song abour student life in groningen . 
  [ stadjers en studenten ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4waufb1udc ) ( stadjer is the nickname of an inhabitant of groningen city who is n't a student ), 
  i would 've added it , but i 've never been !, 
  i found [ this video on the british royal family ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhyygnhhkfw ) quite enlightening and informative . 
  what about feral dogs ? 
  when i went to south america the lady who gave me the injections told me to be careful with bats , monkeys and feral dogs . 
  amsterdam - `` the city of sin '' , but that 's not all !, 
  the rijksmuseum , the van gogh museum and the achterhuis ( anne frank museum ) are three museums that are definitely worth your while !, 
  on top of that the city , which bears the nickname `` venice of the north '' for a reason , is stunningly beautiful . 
  paris - goes without saying . 
  it definitely lives up to its reputation . 
  do n't buy too much into the `` all parisians are jerks '' - stereotype , though . 
  i have found that they are surprisingly friendly . 
  madrid - awesome city . 
  i liked the nightlife , but i especially loved the food culture . 
  if you make it to madrid visit `` el tigre '' , it 's a chain of tapas bars ( there 's three in the city ) where you pay for a drink and then get a shitload of free tapas with it . 
  it 's a real authentic experience , i visited there three times and never saw another tourist inside , just locals . 
  valencia - my personal favorite city in spain . 
  fun nightlife , nice beach , pretty ladies ... what more could you want ? 
  prague - beautiful city , but i personally did n't need to stay more than 1 day before having seen most of it . 
  venice - at first i hated the city . 
  it was crowded , it was dirty , there were tourists everywhere , there were people trying to sell me shit everywhere . 
  but then , i got lost . 
  i wandered off the tourist track and started just randomly going into small alleyways . 
  this is where i fell in love with the city . 
  i wandered around for a couple of hours without encountering more than a handful of other people - most of whom were locals . 
  rome - whereas in most european cities you will marvel at all the old buildings , in rome they have so many stunning buildings that you 'll grow bored of them . 
  `` oh look , another church that 's a thousand years old '' . 
  every street seems to have a building that would , in any other city , be the # 1 tourist attraction . 
  it 's crazy how many beauty there is in this city . 
  vatican city is a great way to spend a day as well . 
  budapest - fun , beautiful , worth a visit .
