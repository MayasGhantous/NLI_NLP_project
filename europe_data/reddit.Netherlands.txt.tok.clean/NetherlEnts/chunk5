  quite small though so i would n't plan on more than a weekend there . 
  copenhagen - i liked it . 
  danish people are great . 
  the city itself is n't all that special though . 
  istanbul - technically not europe ( well actually . . half of it is ) , but if you find yourself in the general direction make sure you pop by !, 
  definitely in my top 5 favorite cities in the world ( together with paris the only european cities on that list ), 
  frankly i hardly use cash at all . 
  ever . 
  there 's a nationwide campaign going here to promote the use of debit card over cash , even for small payments . 
  it 's definitely working , too . 
  i only have cash on me when i go to a bar . 
  could you provide a link to the news story ? 
  i 'm interested in reading it , 
  lowest crime rate in europe , lowest average age in europe and being the only city in the country without regulated closing time makes for awesome nightlife . 
  come visit some time !, 
  indifferent , to be honest . 
  the truth is i do not know enough of the practical implication of a scottish secession . 
  the political realist in me would be opposed though . 
  many student associations here organize hitchhiking contests as a fun activity for members . 
  usually to paris , brussels , antwerp , berlin , etc. 
  atleast in the benelux , france and germany it is very doable i guess . 
  andalusia would be the obvious choice in my opinion . 
  ruled by arab muslims for around 500 years during the middle ages ( 711 - 1212 ) , cities like granada have been heavily influenced by muslims . 
  see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andalusia#islamic_empire_-_al-andalus, 
  we already work the least hours in the eu on average !, 
  i write it before , and if it is a round prize , - goes after . 
  i do n't think cu is that right wing . 
  i would seriously doubt the republicans would get any votes outside the sgp and some fringe parties such as [ jezus leeft ] ( www.jezusleeft.nl ) . 
  ( althought i guess sgp is already pretty fringe ), 
   for some people this is actually * the * definition for liberalism used in ir studies and political science . 
  in other words these `` some people '' = pretty much everyone outside the us, 
  undergrad programmes in english are common ( ish ) in the netherlands, 
  achievements - one of the highest standards of living in the world , great education , great healthcare , very free press , best place to grow up as a kid ( according to unicef ) , no smog , not a lot of crime , progressiveness in many different areas ( drug policy , equality ) shortcomings - lack of nature all in all i am very happy to have been born in my own country . 
  i would say that objectively speaking there are no ( or very few ) places that are as good a place to live or have been born in . 
  `` scheveningen '' was used as a shibboleth in wwii . 
  what strikes me as funny is that during my trips abroad i knew countless people who knew but one phrase in dutch ... `` neuken in de keuken '' . 
  why that phrase in particular remains a mystery to me . 
  ca n't help you with italian or romanian i 'm afraid . 
  i was gon na suggest either budapest or spend three more days in prague . 
  outstanding answer . 
  i would argue that in the netherlands groningen or utrecht would be better choices for nightlife . 
  it might also be a nice chance from the `` big '' capitals to visit a smaller city . 
  groningen has the youngest average age of any city in europe if i 'm not mistaken , it is a university city * pur sang * . 
  it is about 2-3 hours from amsterdam . 
  utrecht is much closer to amsterdam and is pretty much equally fun . 
  a trip to groningen could be combined with a visit to the wadden islands and a [ wadlopen ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=wadlopen&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=u9q&amp;rls=org.mozilla:nl:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=6e0yu8suekgm7qat3ycwbq&amp;ved=0cagq_auoaq&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=789 ) trip which could be perceived as kinda adventurous i guess ? 
   the default setting of dutch university administration is ` slow chaos ' . 
  i hate this . 
  if you need anything you be sent from pillar to post and back . 
  not so much hatred as disappointment . 
  this is not directed towards any single individual . 
  if you are nice , i will like you . 
  if you are a cunt , i wo n't . 
  this is not influenced by your nationality . 
  that being said , i think that american culture in recent history has been extremely disappointing . 
  especially the rampant anti-intellectualism , patriotism and ego-centrism are the cause of this if you ask me . 
  furthermore you guys are pussy-whipped by your government , church , banks and companies . 
  i see so much wasted potential in the usa , which is why i am disappointed . 
  the innovations you could make in fields of art , science , technology ... you could lead the world into space . 
  you could unite the western world in combating world hunger , poverty and war . 
  you could help steer us away from the need for fossile fuels and usher in an era of green energy . 
  instead all this room and potential for innovation is being exploited by merely a minority whilst the rest sits on their couches watching whichever celebrity causing whatever controversy . 
  on the other hand , however , there are many things about and from the us that i love or could n't even imagine living without . 
  / opinion, 
  the famous [ dutch directness ] ( http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2011/05/28/dutch-directness/ ), 
  what 's a `` christmas '' ? 
  without jokes though , germany would be my go-to place if i celebrated christmas . 
  my university flies one, 
  also a stop in luxemburg every summer on the way to france to stock up on gas and liquor ( and cigarettes if you so desire ) . 
  i usually just get a bakfiets when i need to transport larger objects !, 
  for example when i just moved into my new student room i needed a new couch . 
  scored one on marktplaats and then picked it up by bakfiets . 
  not at all . 
  [ speaking of groningen and bikes ] ( http://vimeo.com/76207227 ) . 
  you wll get a [ `` doe normaal man !, 
  '' ] ( http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2010/11/26/no-56-normalcy-doe-normaal/ ) if you 're being overly patriotic . 
   is that correct ? 
  yes  so after i 've spent 90 + days in estonia and then go to spain they wo n't bar my travel for being in estonia so long ? 
  i 've been told there are three , but i have only visited one of them myself so i would n't be able to tell you with 100 % certainty that there are more now . 
  go to one of the three ( ? ), 
  they will get you free tapas with every drink you order , so it 's quite cheap to have a bite + a beer/sangria/tinto verano here . 
  also the atmosphere here is excellent and i have never seen another tourist inside giving it a quite `` authentic '' feel ( not sure if the locals would agree with me on this , just my impression as a tourist ) . 
  well i do care about spelling and proper grammar . 
  it just happens to be that i 'm human and humans make mistakes . 
  no need to point it out . 
  if this were an essay i had to hand in for uni i 'd appreciate it . 
  on reddit , not so much . 
  no , i do n't . 
  if i make a mistake it is likely because of carelessness and not because of bad english . 
  correcting typos on a forum just seems like splitting hairs to me . 
  possibly , although i do n't see why the perfectly valid word `` capital '' would autocorrect to `` capitol '' . 
  i 've heard americans make the same mistake before , this probably stems from the fact that capitol hill is in their capital and so is the building the capitol . 
  capit ** o ** l is [ a building ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/us_capitol_west_side.jpg/800px-us_capitol_west_side.jpg ) , capit ** a ** l is the word you were looking for describing the most important city of a country , usually also the seat of government .

  this is pretty much spot on . 
  it is seen the same as alcohol for the most part .
