  as far as i know pvv is also strongly against any drug . 
  like i said they are less welcome . 
  its a good thing the majority of muslims arent like that . 
  heavily biased alternative facts . 
  muslims are as welcome as any other religion . 
  its just the extremists we dont want , just like we dont want extremist christians or nazis or whatever reason someone has to do harm . 
  oh what a surprise : your posting history is a long list of hate . 
  your entire life is devoted to hate . 
  you are a hateful person and therefore a bad person . 
  you are more hateful than any muslim i know . 
  i posted some more dutch music [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5s6q8v/whats_your_favourite_song_from_your_country/ddcx7x9 ) with different genres and groups, 
  some dutch things i like to add . 
  this samples a couple genres . 
  [ acda en de munnik - het regent zonnestralen ] ( https://youtu.be/dzkbha1nctm ) - pop/folk [ heidevolk - nehalennia ] ( https://youtu.be/kbpdom4qwhe ) - folk/metal [ rapalje - wat zullen we drinken ] ( https://youtu.be/7czq051btle ) - traditional folk [ lange frans en baas b - het land van ] ( https://youtu.be/yaymuzxlttc ) - pop/hiphop i think [ normaal - oerend hard ] ( https://youtu.be/7y_wuu99e7m ) - boerenrock / farmers rock [ boudewijn de groot - avond ] ( https://youtu.be/gwlsa6k5q-w ) - older pop [ scotch - jan tan tetteraai ] ( https://youtu.be/9fabbkluosk ) - ska / balkan / folk [ lais - 7 steken ] ( https://youtu.be/ykktkwlnpm0 ) - belgian group but sings in dutch - a capella by a girls group, 
  as much as i like to remove altretards wherever possible , i dont see why he should be removed here . 
  hahahaha in reality the eu is probably gon na fall due to stupid people , and we 'll get ready for world war 3 . 
  both are actually really good, 
  knock knock it 's the americans with trump rip earth, 
  i 'm willing to visit any place on earth including north korea as long as chances of getting a case of the kills is small enough . 
  so : have n't been to our overseas lands but would like to . 
  are you willing to translate dutch ? 
  / r/nujijinactie and / r/tokkiefeesboek are basically our cringe subs and it includes a bunch of ( facebook posts of ) simple-minded people on all spectra . 
  youre the salty one here, 
  calm down your nationalism and be open to the flaws of your fellow countrymen, 
  i found the small difference between ` a\u00f1os ' and ` anos ' hilarious, 
  at least the users do a good job with downvoting the bad content here . 
  thats why i like it here . 
  oh yes alcoholism is the perfect excuse for anything . 
  sorry italians whose fountain we ruined you cant blame us it was the alcohol . 
  there 's a good list of countries i 've been to . 
  and in many of them the dutch are infamous for being very very very obnoxious . 
  try antwerp ; the dutch have a beyond negative reputation . 
  also funny , in budapest the dutch have a reputation of being easy to trick out of money - especially with alcohol or cheap souvenirs . 
  why so angry m8 ? 
  found the loud obnoxious dutchman . 
  / s please do insult my personal experiences . 
  yours are probably more superior than mine , since you 're so amazingly intelligent . 
  not sure where you came from to post shit on a two week old thread , but do n't . 
  so ... am i supposed to send creepy pms now ? 
  how big of a criminal is bernie , again ? 
  the fact you chose those 2 retards out of 300 million americans says so much about your country . 
  you 're accusing me of lacking in political knowledge , but at least i have enough political knowledge not to elect an internet meme . 
   says country which elected an internet meme, 
   denial intensifies, 
  dutch people aged 16-50 may be very loud , obnoxious and entitled . 
  also drunk . 
  destroying stuff , stealing stuff , etc. 
  maybe not the majority , but a very significant part of them . 
  and you can recognise them because they dont blend in with locals at all . 
  not even trying . 
  its like they want to have a sign on their heads saying `` i am a dutch tourist please laugh at me and steal my money '' . 
  also the thinking that nobody abroad can understand them so they think its no problem to yell the most obscure stuff . 
  good for you that your lady bits are foaming like a good brew , but i have already identified 5 other dutch families who are now also sharing that mental image ... 
  the yelling in general is so annoying . 
  one way i easily recognise dutch people is because i can suddenly hear a familiar language from across the fucking city . 
  shut the fuck up and show some respect you 're louder than the rest of the city combined . 
  seems like the brainwashing got through to you and now you 're defending it . 
  at least when he gets elected it will be because of an actual majority vote . 
  maybe its time to fix that outdated election process that hasnt held up for like 100 years already . 
  peer pressure ? 
  on children ? 
  naaah if they just bow to the flag the flag will help them get through it and get a nice job in the army . 
  optional ? 
  i keep reading about students getting in trouble for not saying it or standing up during it . 
  sure , by law it is optional but when everyone around you is brainwashed the horde will come for you . 
  i usually recognise fellow dutch people because theyre loud and obnoxious . 
  its like dutch people would prefer a massive blinking sign on their heads which reads `` i am a dutch tourist please point and laugh at me '' . 
  also what massive assholes dutch people are abroad . 
  most dutch people barge around like they own the place . 
  was in hungary earlier this year and could recognise dutch people from kilometers away . 
  felt a bit ashamed . 
  especially because hungarians are , believe it or not , way more humble than most west-euros . 
  i felt like it was n't that bad in france , which ive been to often , but thats most likely because the french are so much worse than the dutch you kinda forget about the dutch . 
  also the home country of https://youtu.be/s9ybicd43mc, 
  if youre from north/west europe or from the us you should check out hungary , and not just budapest . 
  its so much different from what we are used to but it 's so beautiful . 
  sure , the poverty is quite present , but people are happy , the food and drinks are good and there is no reason to be bored there . 
  beautiful sights all about , a lot of history and a lot to do . 
  took me some googling to find that joke is football related . 
  oh yes . 
  that was the last time belgium managed to somewhat organise itself into doing something useful . 
  unless you count horrible genocide as useful . 
  lecso can be so good, 
  it 's just so smooth like they 've been beaten into submission already . 
  the dutch law says the following : you need to be able to show id ( drivers license , passport , id card ) at all times when required . 
  usually this only happens when shit is going down . 
  you are not required to carry it - thus a police officer can not ask you for your id for the sake of checking if you have one . 
  this ensures that your id will only be checked if you do shit . 
  not just for reason of random inspections . 
  99/100 times i use my id is to prove my age when buying alcohol , smokes or weed . 
  the other 1/100 is when i have to identify myself when dealing with things like insurance and such things . 
  never been to krakow or prague but i can third budapest . 
  damn what an amazing place - especially if you go with someone who knows the good parts . 
  seeing as the anti-muslim anti-eu and anti-foreign policies are very much right and those are his main policies i think it goes right a lot . 
  you also forgot his point of stopping all funding for anything culture related ( music , arts , history [ including windmills ] ) which is more rightwing than the us rightwing . 
  have you actually read his program ? 
  theres hardly anything left in there . 
  by your logic hitler wasnt a nazi because he had some liberal ideas . 
  i see it a lot . 
  kinda depends on what region as the rural regions dont have a lot of it .
