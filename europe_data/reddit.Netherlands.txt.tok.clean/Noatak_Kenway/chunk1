[ i remember the last democratically elected leader that wanted to erect a palace of such proportions ] ( http://youtu.be/doxmrvr00ri?t=9m50s ), 
  you do n't need a monarchy for a ruler to act like a king . 
  all of europe has been at war the last 100 years , most nations even twice or more , and the last 3 decades european nations have been at war on foreign soil . 
  ( besides that , we see war and conflict on the news , daily . ), 
  i think it 's indeed safe to say most of us know what war is like . 
  as someone interested in history , it 's still baffling to realise the territory i live in has been part of the roman empire , carolingian empire , holy roman empire , dutch united seven republics , french first empire and the greater german reich , and that the church in my city centre is casually some 600 years old .

  * the us was even involved in two global wars , and came out the victor in both *, 
  i , indeed , love anime , and i would love to be able to speak japanese , but i simply have no use for it in daily life in the netherlands . 
  if i lived in japan , i would say yes - i would learn the shit out of it to be able to communicate properly and respect the japanese - , but japanese is n't spoken much outside of japan . 
  his first exile was to elba , though ; that little island between corsica and italy . 
  to be honest , the borders of alexander 's empire extended way beyond macedonia and greece , though . 
  til i am '' gek '' . 
  and you were right . 
  it was a combined effort that brought germany to its fall ( along with the incompetence from the nazi regime that was almost doomed to fail . ), 
  and european / french resistance . 
  they did a lot to help the allied forces and thwart the german wehrmacht and ss divisions . 
  you have been made a mod on / r/russia, 
  merkel would probably end up being assassinated by elizabeth 's secret service of corgis . 
  a lot . 
   grachten were the life-lines of dutch and flemish cities . 
  they were used for many purposes : for transportation , for draining , for water-winning and as sewers , all at the same time . 
  in heavy populated cities these combined functions repeatedly proved to be detrimental to the public health . 
  most hanseatic cities have grachten to transport , to load and to land goods in and from ships . 
  sometimes grachten were made from older rivers , like in groningen . 
  there the older river called drentse aa was used as a natural part of the grachten . 
  source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gracht so essentially , the amsterdam 's '' grachtengordel '' was used as a ` natural ' defensive barrier - which separated countless '' blocks '' of houses , which made an invasion of the city a very difficult task - , a drainage system for human excrement and waste , and used as a '' highway '' for smaller ( cargo ) ships/boats to carry goods from a warehouse somewhere in the city towards the larger ships , ready to sail off to the colonies / trade partner or vice versa . 
  also , bear in mind that amsterdam was built on a marshy area , which was rich with flooded areas - as are more of the lower parts of the netherlands , such as the haque and rotterdam - , so we ( the dutch ) had to find some way to live harmoniously with the water as we still do today with the most intricate waterworks in the world . 
  ** edit ** : also , in industrial - and modern day netherlands ; several cities have ( or have had ) a grachtengordel , which serves as a highway for goods , as i described above . 
  these city highways ( or the cities and villages themselves ) would then be connected between one another by water '' highways '' throughout the dutch countryside to transport goods all throughout the nation . 
  bear in mind that before the mid-20th century , there were no highways in the netherlands buzzing with large trucks that brought the goods from location to location ; we had the intricate dutch waterways to serve that purpose , all the way until after ww2 and still to this day . 
  one of the reasons rotterdam is the largest and most used port in europe , is because the dutch waterways connect directly to the ruhr-area and several important '' in-land ports '' at which the goods can be moved to trucks and transported further . 
  several men in this video are being shot . 
  ** edit ** : the footage was - thank the gods for this - shown at the evening news in the netherlands . 
  ( albeit a bit shortened and mixed with a lot of other footage , but it still showed the core elements of men being shot ), 
  remember when germans put their hoheitsadlers everywhere ? 
  good old times man ... 
  oh , thanks . 
  do n't know how it got there . . 
  another photograph of her wearing the vest http://www.repstatic.it/content/nazionale/img/2014/01/28/205119787-faf0c132-4836-41d2-b04b-7920290d1e1c.jpg ** edit ** : she 's also sort of attractive . . 
  if you 're not opposed to that sort of thing . 
  i escape to reddit to get away from idiots in our parliament . 
  oh , well , they 're just having a fight . 
  nothing wrong abo ... did he just fucking throw that pencil !, 
  did he just fucking did that !!!? 
  he 's just chillin ' . 
  iron discipline , because of his career as a fighter . 
  i ca n't possibly imagine why we are even slightly annoyed by the us . . now that you 're here ; any chance you might be able to shed some light on russia 's stance towards my country , the netherlands ? 
  we 've had a cold russia-netherlands friendship year , to be honest . 
  though , lot of trade was conducted i 've heard , which is good . 
  ( i 'm not the one complaining , by the way . 
  that greenpeace act was beyond idiotic - violating established international laws just like that - and our foreign minister was seemingly only trying to save some face for our already unpopular cabinet / current government and trying to look tough '' fighting '' big mother russia like that . ), 
  anyway , currently the majority here is trying to stop our king , queen and our prime minister going to sotchi , because . . '' anti-homosexual laws '' . 
  i do sort of agree with the fact that russia could be violating the rights of homosexuals from what i 've heard , though i 'm not that well factually acquainted with russia 's laws and general sentiment , so i ca n't judge too much about that . 
  i do see all man equal , whatever religious , sexual or political preference they may hold . 
  but to stop sending our king , queen and prime minister ( who both represent our very nation and brokers all sorts of trade deals ) is beyond ridiculous . 
  business knows no borders and to isolate us from russia - pretending it is still the ussr , sometimes - is not helping either . . ** edit ** : also , the european union is starting to involve itself , along with the olympic committee . 
  seems like a good old nato '' east-bloc bashing '' to me , truth be told . 
  '' shit . . '' ~ netherlands . 
   their government is not developing wmd , or biological weapons , just to let our fellow us government know  they 're not using * that * excuse again , are they ? 
  a common enemy works charms , indeed .

  the joke , for those unaware : http://picblow.com/img/full/1088.jpg, 
   nedduhhrrrrrlends, 
  funny how their way of '' funny speaking '' is the same as dutchmen talking gibberish / funny . 
  i 'm dutch , born and raised , and i failed that test . . 
  yeah , we feel the same way about danish , frankly enough . 
  sssssh , now . 
  only dreams . 
  haha !,

  seriously wales , get it together !, 
  it 's almost as if we just had a 40 year long war of spying and scaring each other off with nuclear deterrents . . 
  * these are not the nukes you 're looking for . 
  sucking a toddlers penile regions is n't entirely orthodox either . 
  dear israel , grow up and accept the fact that these practises are medieval abominations .

  t'is but a matter of time . 
  pedophilia is a sin !, 
  * unless it 's in the name of god , of course . 
  joke is on our southward neighbours ; the dutch language incorporates a lot of french words . 
  ( not to mention that they use the metric system . . ), 
  netherlands * absolutely nothing . 
  i believe this was already a law in the united kingdom . 
  allochtone / allochtoon = non-native of a country / immigrant for the non-dutch speaker . 
  they 're not very effective in war , other than serving as a buffer country . . like us . . 
  in case they became bored of africa , russia , middle-east , north america , south america and australia . 
  nationality checks out . 
  interesting . 
  we allowed it . 
  i mean , it is understandable . 
  sorry belgi\u00eb , the iron bank and braavos itself are inspired by the dutch republic and dutch golden age in the show . 
  the turkey missiles were a cover , what the soviets really wanted was a return of dr. nikolai stepanovich sokolov to the soviet union .
