  he said he would take this referendum seriously but we all know he does n't give a rats ass about what the people think and in the end he will always do what the eu wants him to do . 
  it 's not like his party suffers from his cowardice and lies because he basically broke all of his election promises and is still doing well in the polls . 
  i 'm still going to vote just to see him sweat a little but still , it 's kinda useless . 
  of course interpretation changes all the time . 
  scientific discoveries which disprove the possibilities of certain stories have done that . 
  that does n't mean the story is less valuable as it still teaches us many things . 
  the church is bound to the scripture and tradition , it does not bend to the will of society . 
  that is the whole point of catholicism , you are expected to change for jesus not the other way around . 
  uhm , no it is n't . . 
  it is moderate because people slowly became smarter and less ignorant . 
  more people started to interpret the bible better and started living like christians instead of just calling themselves so . 
  every necessary reform was done by the clergy and not by `` the forces of society '' . 
  islam is more war orientated than christianity , have you ever read the quran ? 
  the differences are clear . 
  show us the way , conquistador . 
  spain has known the way of counter jihad since 718 !, 
  you can not compare christianity to islam , that is just generalising religion which is na\u00efve . 
  practising christianity would do no harm to our economy nor security/safety but it would have impact on our way of life ; little to no feminisation and less hedonism . 
  we were doing very well even before we secularised . 
  this may be an unpopular opinion but i believe islam would n't be such a problem as it is now in europe if we had sticked to religion . 
  not to mention that europe is breeding generations of cowards and sissies which would n't be possible if christianity was still mainstream . 
  i understand why some people are non-religious , you ca n't force yourself to belief in god but nowadays most people are atheist because they have the entirely wrong view of christianity . 
  they were n't raised in it and we are stuck with the believes that christians are responsible for all the bad stuff that ever happened in europe . 
  people do n't realise that back in the 1200 ad almost everyone was ignorant and savage compared to todays standards . 
  not just europe but everywhere around the world . 
  and it was europe that , despite christianity which is oh so bad , evolved into a super continent while other did n't . 
  of course people hate christianity but ffs open a history book and learn about the good stuff that happened . 
  and for your understanding , god has never been disproven and can not be disproven . 
  every new scientific discovery is just prove to me that there is a god and that this whole complex system which we call the universe is far too beautifull to just happen on its own . 
  it is actually growing hard everywhere in the world but europe , which is ironic because europeans were among his first subscribers . 
  i can handle people being atheist but it is not fun to be laughed at or be called an idiot for something our ancestors have done for a thousand years . 
  oh well , maybe the rebellious teenagers of tommorow will be religious once atheism has been mainstream long enough . 
  really you do n't have to be butthurt about a thing as little as this . 
  seperated these values are n't unique but all of them put together is unique . 
  by that logic communism would also be a fascist ideology, 
  `` usually '' does n't mean it 's right . 
  their economic systems are familiar but that 's about it . 
  fascism is n't that much about racism . 
  nazism is no form of fascism in any way !, 
  but it hurts my eyes . 
  as a historian-to-be these are the things that annoy me the most !, 
  they are entirely different and incomparable !, 
  hitler was n't fascist , that is basic history !, 
  i 'm not trying to defend their actions i 'm just telling you what it is . 
  national socialists are worse than fascists . 
  neo nazi 's are n't fascist though and most just salute for the shock value of it . 
  what an idiot , as if we do n't have enough idiots already . . 
  i believe the church 's catechism explains that the moment the fetus comes into existence it already has a soul . 
  killing it would mean killing a person , not that hard to understand right ? 
  i do n't know if you 've ever witnessed an abortion but it looks horrible and only looks worse the older the fetus gets . 
  if you do n't want a child than do n't fuck around . 
  and anti-abortion is n't just for the religious , i know quite a bit of atheists too who condemn abortion . 
  that is some dark sense of humour you got there , you crazy serb !, 
  europe seems to have a talent for supporting the wrong parties . 
  it 's sad we still get blamed for srebrenica by many , our army was heavily outnumbered and there was little we could do . 
  if you ca n't beat a ideology , why not get rid of it ? 
  forget isis , this is the real threat !, 
  i 've explained this in previous posts on the same topic . 
  i do n't know what you are talking about , he has never had more followers than he has right now . 
  they often have double passports and i would n't consider them dutch . 
  they are far from intergrated into our society . 
  20 % is enough for him to win the elections currently . 
  maurice the hond talked about 40/150 seats which is * almost * 1/3, 
  moroccan is n't an ethnicity , it 's an nationality , a big difference there . 
  did n't i just tell you why ? 
  i refuse to type a wall of text again only to get the same stupid argument again . 
  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwnnhdvtg8 this is the interview in which he calls for ** peacefull ** resistance . 
  to a certain extent i agree . 
  opinion polls and election results differ often but we can all expect wilders to end at least second if we take murphey 's law into this . 
  here is your prove : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwnnhdvtg8 no only leftists believe he has to distance himself from this nonsense . 
  if he distances himself from it it would raise suspicion he would indirectly admit he has something to do with it . 
  so he wo n't and he should n't . 
  i do n't share any religious believes with the average dutch civilian because most are atheist . 
  now if there were catholic militia that killed and destroyed wherever they went , i would of course distance myself from it . 
  just like i distance myself from what so many priests have done with little children . 
  as for ethnicity , that is just bullshit . 
  i never claimed people of the same race should distance themselves from the rotten apples , that is just stupid . 
  race is n't something you can change or help . 
  i think you are mixing up race and culture . 
  it does n't matter what you think because he can be quoted on this . 
  he called for peacefull resistance in front of a camera multiple times , do you want a link ? 
  and no he does n't have to distance himself from it because he never called for violent resistance . 
  the media and certain political parties try to destroy his reputation and this is why he told them to fuck off . 
  first of all , show me that survey and secondly , no it ** is ** good enough and no i will not distance myself from antiziganist views of fellow dutch people because i have nothing to do with it . 
  islam and the ideas it brings with it is something isis and muslims share with each other , antiziganism is not something i share with dutch people . 
  how is this not clear to you ? 
  psv eindhoven has done it as well as our prime minister i believe !, 
  not available from what i know . 
  best i can do is give you this link : http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2016/03/zeghet.html, 
  he was set on trial for promising to lessen the amount of moroccans in the country . 
  however , he did n't say he would forcefully like to deport them . 
  he wants to encourage remigration and kick out criminal immigrants . 
  nothing he said is illegal yet the left grabs every chance they get to try and get him in jail . 
  both !, 
  because isis is islamic and recent polls have proven that quite an amount of muslims have no problem with supporting other terrorist group like hamas and quite an amount of them also prefer sharia over democracy . 
  i would say it is quite logical wilders asks this of them . 
  he has almost 1/3 of the population behind him ( including those who abstain from voting . 
  excluding those would probably still result in wilders winning on election day but the amount of people not voting is too damn high compared to other parties ) unless he wins over the absolute majority he will never be able to form a coalition because everyone is deliberately isolating the pvv . 
  immigration policies and position towards non-european cultures , islamic cultures in particular , seem to matter most in politics nowadays . 
  her economic ideas may differ but i would definitely call her leftist regarding immigration policies , even dangerously so .
