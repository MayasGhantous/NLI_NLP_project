  that 's china . 
  in fact , sometimes the us has higher standards than the eu ( but opposition to ttip occasionally seems to stem from irrational anti-americanism ), 
  this . 
  what is actually is is a treaty allowing both american and european companies ( including small businesses ) to sell products in each other markets more easily without having to modify it slightly because of standards that only slightly differ . 
  probably without the things the internet says it contains , aka the treaty as how it stands now . 
  in what way is tax evasion by the rich related to an international trade deal ? 
   no one fucking wants this shit . 
  ceta is public because it is finished , unlike ttip . 
  no standards shall be drastically lowered to china-tier . 
  the only standards that 'll be chanted are standards that are so close together that the difference is n't noticeable . 
  and the eu basically does the same, 
  if the eu kills ttip , brexit will ensure that the brits will end up with a trade deal with the americans before the eu . 
  which would be humiliating . 
  it 's standard in trade negotiations to keep it secret as to have an upper hand . 
  because it is great . 
  you fell for the misinformation . 
  this . 
  it would mean all time would have been wasted . 
  and after that it becomes 80 % , 90 % or 100 % . 
  this . 
  ever since the negotiations started a hate campaign of misinformation was waged against the treaty . 
  in what way is it about ripping off people ? 
  just go to / r/conspiracy already, 
  still , what makes bickering about the whole thing a good idea ? 
  it only causes more economic uncertainty for the entire union , especially when negotiations keep going on and on without any result . 
  is n't representative democracy meant to prevent this sort of thing ? 
  and i see my perspective is a little skewed , as the netherlands are basically on the level of denmark . 
  the us embargo on iran is in no way comparable with the eu playing petty politics . 
   the eu needs to maintain that legitimacy in its own citizens ' eyes . 
  and its own citizens want a harsh treatment of the uk which implies that politicians are a perfect representation of the electorate . 
  i think the vast majority of people within the eu want a happy divorce with the brits , instead of making it a messy divorce . 
  the problem is that \\* some \\* politicians are obsessed with punishing the brits because they are obsessed with their eurofederalist ideology . 
  and as we all know , punishing people makes people like said ideology . 
  france did that before yet another war . 
   edit : also , destroying its economy means less money for warfare and better outcome for the rest of the world in this case . 
  that 's exactly what the french thought back in 1919 . 
  we all know what happened afterwards . 
  so you want to economically destroy russia , likely causing it to fall apart ? 
  the consequences wo n't be too peaceful . 
  russia falling apart means that you 'd have a whole bunch of weak states , which , due to the economic destruction , would be a breeding ground for all sorts of extremist movements , whether nazi , communist or islamist ( that ** all ** hate the west ) . 
  chechnya in particular would probably end up like afghanistan ( or islamic state ) , except that it 's even closer to europe , giving material support to all sorts of terrorist organizations , necessitating a military intervention at some point . 
  yes , russia is a threat , but it 's a threat we can understand . 
  destroying it would open a huge can of worms . 
  so yes , we should push back . 
  we should allow russia to separate peacefully . 
  but economical destruction is n't the way . 
   russia wo n't be able to sell gas to europe, 
  we live in a free country . 
  the so-called ` us propaganda outlets ' are free to decide what they publish . 
  do n't forget the plagiarism that is getting out of hand . 
  newspapers are making themselves irrelevant at record breaking speed . 
   but this inflation has an upper limit , which is defined by what each person can use at a time . 
  depends on what kind of product it is . 
  unless you want to instate state control of property , which is communist . 
   which would be expirable . 
  if the us was to participate . 
   also , there are a number of laws everywhere aiming at limiting to the max the building of new houses , which is aimed , guess what , at preserving artificially high property prices . 
  so these laws should be repealed . 
   also property owners are mostly older people , who are also the ones who vote the most . 
  guess who are politicians going to listen to ? 
  indeed . 
  so quit whining about how boomers supposedly rigged the system against you , and ** go out and fucking vote already **  depends on where you live . 
  what if you are n't one of the lucky ones living in low interest countries ? 
  there 's plenty of ways to pay it back . 
  even the us allows you to postpone payment for 2 years or something . 
   this is cute . 
  in italy and spain there 's actual engineers and doctors who ca n't find stable , decently paying jobs there 's places in the eu with a shortage of engineers and doctors  why do cheap products increase the demand for labor ? 
  because cheaper products means that consumption will go up , therefore production has to go up , also increasing the demand for labor ( at lower cost , maybe ) . 
  companies still need people buying their stuff . 
  they 're not huge boxes that try to fuck you over at every single possibility . 
   our children will be less than us , judging by fertility trends . 
  so the problem will represent itself . 
  actually , fertility trends are set to remain constant , or slightly increase . 
  high spending has a physical limit , yes . 
  but if demand exceeds supply ( which happens when consumers buy lots of products ) prices will increase , causing inflation . 
  excessive money printing during high conjunctures accelerates the effect , because the supply of money increases causing more spending . 
  the act of money printing itself does n't cause inflation . 
   that something else would be some valuable commodity , which few have like dollar bills . 
   i also do n't know why more demand for cheap products creates more demand for labor ? 
  those products need to be produced somehow . 
  and if there 's so much unemployment , the price of labor will end up below the price of capital . 
  at some point , the elderly will have died off and are replaced by a smaller , younger population . 
   the problem never really gets solved because millennials will probably keep having few children , surely even less than boomers . 
  fertility rates in europe are just declining . 
  so that by the time we get to retirement age , there will be a smaller workforce to support us and the cycle continues unsustainably . 
  it wo n't be as dramatic as the current situation . 
   but when we spent your pension , it made us look good and we got re-elected . 
  and thats what matters politicians and the people controlling the pensionfunds are 100 % to blame . 
  representative democracy should prevent this , yet it does n't . 
   that does n't change the fact that in my country my parents ' generation voted for hundreds of corrupted idiots who screwed the country and the alternatives would likely have been corrupt as well . 
  quit blaming your parents . 
   house prices over the roof , high rents which will eventually drop if nobody can afford housing . 
  this is merely an argument to increase the supply . 
   high personal debt , student debts , few jobs with some responsible financial management you can get over that . 
  and depending on where you live student interest rates are ridiculously low . 
  besides that , studying gender studies or politicology is the best way to end up on welfare . 
   automation looming at the horizon which wo n't cause mass unemployment . 
  the increased productivity allows for cheaper products , increasing the demand for labor . 
  and if it causes mass unemployment , the demand for products would drop , forcing manufacturers to lower their prices , causing ( hyper ) deflation . 
   very high childcare costs if you 're unemployed you do n't need childcare .
