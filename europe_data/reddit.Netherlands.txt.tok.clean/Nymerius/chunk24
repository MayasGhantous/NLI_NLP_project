  some people will have trouble with stronger accents , but this is quite rare . 
  when i attended university in the northern netherlands each year included some freshmen from the south and west that had significant trouble with more accented dutch speakers from the north , but this is quite rare - 1 or 2 per year of 100 people , i 'd say , and the misunderstanding was usually only 1 way . 
  that 's actually quite interesting , as swedish tv appears to be much better , at least from a distance . 
  imported swedish crime shows are quite popular in the netherlands , and much higher quality than we produce ourselves . 
  saba has only been part of the netherlands since 2010 , following a popular vote on the island , and most of the mainland dutchies do n't even want it . 
  quite the imperialism !, 
  as this post is deleted by now i 'm going to keep this a bit short , but i feel you deserve a reply . 
  i 've seen the ap world history requirements - long lists of facts and subjects that must be covered , many more than we 're used to here . 
  if our history education was anything like that then yes , the american revolution should be in there . 
  compared to american history education there 's a stronger focus on understanding processes , sources and historiography in uk and dutch history education . 
  we zoom in on a few topics that are considered instructive and provide kids with the tools to do further history research themselves rather than attempt to cover everything . 
  to give an example of this , last year there was a specific focus on dutch high schools on understanding wwii . 
  rather than covering all fronts the national test focused on `` germany , 1871-1945 '' . 
  this gives the ability to place the rise and fall of the nazis in a much more comprehensive context and is considered to be much more instructive than covering all fronts on a shorter timeline . 
  the us is the only country that i 'm aware of that separates history in this way . 
  the british just have 1 single gcse history . 
  in general we just do n't see the american revolution as an important part of the spread of enlightenment ideals . 
  there 's much more focus on the development of those ideas , which was done in europe before 1776 , and the french revolution , which had an extensive impact on all major european powers . 
  the american revolution accelerated some ongoing processes in our countries , but there 's much more focus on the root causes and original ideas rather than that far-away event that somewhat sped things up that were inevitable anyway . 
  i know you asked uk redditors , but since i believe the curricula are quite comparable in this era you might be interested in a summary of the most popular dutch history book . 
  incidentally , this same chapter also includes the only mention of the american civil war in our curriculum . 
  note that this is what you 'd call an ap class world history in america . 
  the paragraph titles are direct translations , the summaries are a bit more loose . 
  ** enlightenment and revolutions ** * what is the enlightenment ? 
  * most people were religious . 
  voltaire , kant and many other thinkers disagreed and argued for rationality and empiricism . 
  a push for more accessible education and the first encyclopedias followed soon . 
  * enlightenment thinkers on religion and society * many enlightenment thinkers criticized christianity , rise of deism . 
  rise of different schools of thought on morality and ethics . 
  additionally , many groundbreaking thoughts on the role and obligations of the government . 
  locke 's thoughts on human rights and righteous revolutions , montesquieu and sovereignty , the trias politica . 
  ** rulers and enlightenment ideas ** * enlightened despotism * frederick the great reforms prussia : religious freedom , support of arts and sciences , canals , education , codified national laws , bureaucracy . 
  * public opinions * the spread of newspapers , books , coffee houses , libraries , encyclopedias and scientific societies meant opinions could be shared and discussed and the position of absolutist rulers weakened . 
  this was especially the case in france where salons became a meeting place for thinkers . 
  censure was sometimes attempted but the spread of ideas could no longer be fully stopped . 
  ** the people in power ** * revolution in america * thomas jefferson 's declaration of independence started the american revolution . 
  the thirteen colonies became independent , wrote a constitution , and became a representative democracy . 
  in 1791 the bill of rights followed . 
  causes of the american revolution : strong influence of enlightenment ideals and a history of a degree of self governance due to the distance between the colonies and europe . 
  the successful revolution accelerated the ongoing processes in europe , and tensions and revolts followed in the netherlands and prussia . 
  * the french revolution * the `` revolution of revolutions '' followed . 
  although the first french republic lasted just 10 years before napoleon took over it 's the most significant one as it was the most radical one and escalated to involve almost all major powers . 
  lots more details about the french revolution : the role of louise xiv , the third estate , assault on the bastille , declaration of the rights of man , jacobins , marie-antoinette and the guillotine . 
  * european slave trade and slavery * history of slavery , the triangle trade , plantations , and then in 1791 the haitian slave uprising . 
  it 's clear that slavery does n't fit enlightenment ideals and by now it 's a huge topic in intellectual discussions . 
  * slave trade and slavery : a controversial history * the uk became the first nation with a significant movement to abolish slavery . 
  this was succesful : in 1807 the slave trade was abolished and the abolishment of slavery followed . 
  over the course of the 19th century most countries followed suit , although this caused a civil war in the us . 
  abolitionism is still controversial as it puts the focus of ending slavery on white people that did the right thing eventually rather than a successful emancipation battle by blacks . 
  the vast majority of my media consumption is in english , yes , but i do n't dislike dutch as a language . 
  dutch is simply a minor language with few speakers which means films and series tend to be low budget and , as a result , often low quality . 
  there 's also a lack of diversity , because the market for , say , sf-loving dutch speakers is even smaller a good dutch sf series will probably never exist . 
  as i have a good command of english there 's no need to settle for that , i can take advantage of the wide variety of english language media that 's available . 
  note that books are a different story , dutch literature is quite popular and has a good reputation . 
  dutch people tend to speak foreign languages fairly well and our culture values pragmatism very highly , much higher than patriotism . 
  we have no trouble with tourists coming here while not speaking the language and i think most dutchmen would n't consider you a fully integrated immigrant while you do n't speak the language , though , and in general we expect people that stay here permanently to make an effort to learn dutch , although you 're right , we 're not making it easy for you . 
  we may be a flat country but the highest point of the netherlands is a [ potentially active volcano . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_scenery ), 
  nice list of questions , i 'll get the answers to you via pm . 
  i 'm dutch and happy to help , shoot me a pm with what you need . 
  voice chat is possible if that 's helpful . 
  ah , yes , that is n't the case here at all . 
  there 's a minor fine ( 50 euros , i believe ) and confiscation if you 're caught with alcohol in public , it 's certainly no felony matter . 
  parents can be fined as well , although we tend to punish rather lightly because everyone makes mistakes while raising kids . 
  a recent example : the mother of a 14 year old girl that ended up in hospital after drinking too much on her own birthday party at home did n't get punished , her mother got a 400 euro fine because although she was n't present a reasonable parent should have known about the alcohol and taken measures . 
  note that it was perfectly legal for the mother to purchase the alcohol and leave her daughter to party - she just evidently had n't taken adequate measures to prevent escalation . 
  venice of the north is a very common nickname for giethoorn , i 've never heard it used in reference to our capital city . 
  we do n't have a paris of the north , at least not a city commonly known by that name , although eindhoven shares then parisian nickname of `` the city of lights ' due to its strong association with philips and the electrical lighting industry . 
  congratulations on a chance to see a bit of europe !, 
  first of all : london is an awesome city , do you think have enough time to explore it during your work week ? 
  i 've been to london twice for a week of complete vacation each time and i 'd love to go back there , there 's just too much to see and do . 
  i can see the temptation to go to different countries but it 'd be a shame to spend your spare weekend time mostly in transit . 
  especially traveling relatively cheap might be an issue - cheaper flights tend to go from airports an hour outside london to airports hours outside other cities , and remember you 're crossing country borders as a foreigner , passport controls might cause delays . 
  yes , the louvre is awesome to see if you 're interested in culture , but if your choice is between an hour in the louvre and 2 hours each in the british museum , v&a , tate and national gallery in london i 'd just pick the latter . 
  if you do decide to hop countries , all 3 cities you mention have solid public transportation both within the city and to and from airports , and they 're popular tourist spots for good reasons . 
  you 'll enjoy yourself there . 
  the same would apply to amsterdam , barcelona , berlin , and many more cities . 
  as a dutchman i 'd certainly recommend amsterdam for a weekend trip , it has a huge amount of cultural highlights packed in a very compact city center and it 's a bit easier to visit a lot of them than in some other cities . 
  you wo n't need to speak the language for just a weekend trip in popular tourist spots . 
  if you 're looking to limit the costs a bit you could consider a trip to a cheaper country in 1 of the weekends . 
  you certainly wo n't get bored in 1 weekend in any of the baltic countries , poland , or much of middle and eastern europe , but this can give you a chance to experience entirely different cultures at much cheaper rates . 
  do n't discard riga , gdansk or prague because they do n't have the same fame in america , in my experience they 're all beautiful cities and it 'll save you hundreds of dollars . 
  note that they use pasteurized milk because unpasteurized milk is usually illegal to import in the us . 
  only the cheap knock-off brands do that here because it 's easier to produce . 
  the [ camemberts on the wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camembert ) are unpasteurized , you can see they look quite different from the american variety and they 're much more flavourful and , well , much better . 
  a similar story applies to a lot of other types of cheese like brie , the good stuff is illegal to import in the us , although i hear some good varieties are produced in the us itself . 
  one thing you should realize is that the us government is already paying more per capita than our countries . 
  we do n't look at our systems as more expensive and we do n't have to justify a higher tax rate because we have universal health care , we do n't pay more taxes than americans because of this . 
  most dutch stereotypes seem to be quite positive . 
  i suppose we 're considered very rude and constantly stoned , but both of those are just exaggerations of attitudes that we take great pride in , our directness and liberal attitudes . 
  i do n't mind them . 
  i suppose one thing i do n't like is the portrayal of the netherlands as some backwards 50 's place in american media . 
  [ the blacklist ] ( https://youtu.be/9iszogrgiwi?t=3m6s ) had a particularly bad example recently , that 's just an iphone and a 70 's tv placed into a 1940 's decor with outfits from that time too . 
  our interior decorating and fashion industries have moved on since then and we do have flatscreen tv 's and chromecasts in our homes as well , thank you very much . 
  bonfires are reasonably common in more rural areas , but the netherlands is quite urbanized so a vast majority of people wo n't be near one regularly . 
  like many other countries we do have a traditional holiday involving fire too - in our case it 's easter day , although this is mainly celebrated with bonfires in the eastern parts of the country . 
  easter day bonfires tend to look like [ this ] ( http://img.rtvoost.nl/t3/240302.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.opdnakker.nl/sites/default/files/paasvuur-op%20d'n%20akker.png ) and are huge social gatherings . 
  1 in 7 dutch people visited a dance event last year and 40 % of people over 16 self identifies as an edm fan . 
  there were 170 dance festivals in 2014 in our country of only 17 million people . 
  i 'm personally not a massive fan but it 's certainly huge here .
