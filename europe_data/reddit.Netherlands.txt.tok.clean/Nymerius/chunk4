  a lot of informal contact with the language helps , but it 's certainly a priority at schools too . 
  languages are a higher priority here in general . 
  our education system works quite differently from yours , but people at the highest level will normally be expected to speak 2 foreign languages at a level that 's actually above your ap level , and two or three beyond that at a lower proficiency is n't uncommon . 
  i 'm honestly entirely unaware of this stereotype . 
  judging by the other replies it 's a thing , but it 's not something the eu gets accused of in my environment . 
  [ wikipedia has quite a few , yeah !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venice_of_the_north ), 
  you 're answering your own question , your fear has no basis in fact . 
  regardless of the current media hype france will be an upgrade in safety . 
  shit can happen , but you 're much more likely to get hurt staying in the us . 
  come over , and have fun !, 
  my alma mater ( top 100 university in most of those lists ) cared about them quite a bit , but mostly for its asian profile . 
  the rankings have their flaws , but it 's quite obvious they 're taken seriously in a lot of the world which means you have to go along with it to be competitive for the best international students and staff . 
  very few people actually feel it means anything , though , and they were frequently mocked by the staff and university board , both in public and private . 
  it 's seen mostly as an annoying hoop to jump through . 
  my personal opinion : i agree with the critics that they are rather subjective and english-focused . 
  i think the german and french systems come out particularly badly with the metrics currently used . 
  an example for each : the french due to the language barrier , the germans due to the max planck institutes . 
   why is it difficult to have a decent discussion ? 
  it appears to me that this is in large part to the role of diversity and immigration in american culture . 
  any suggestion that a lot of other countries are at least as diverse as the us , or that the us is not doing particularly well on racism is met with a zeal and fanaticism that goes beyond the subject material . 
  people get so angry at the mere suggestion that a discussion usually becomes toxic very quickly , it 's just too important to the self-image of many americans and they are personally insulted by what 's intended as an open cultural exchange . 
   also , is racial categorization not as prevalent in europe no , it is n't . 
  not legally , the government is forbidden from tracking information like that in many countries . 
  but not culturally either , and perhaps that 's more important . 
  it 's extremely uncommon , especially along american racial lines . 
  the american black/white/asian / latino distinction does n't exist here , racism/xenophobia is far more commonly based on culture . 
  for example , it 's easier for me to imagine a hypothetical scenario on a dutch primary school where the culturally dutch black and white kids unite against polish immigrants rather than any racially based conflict . 
  i 'm sad to see this question at 0 points , by the way - the large differences between the us and european countries on issues like these are fascinating , and it seems impossible to have a decent discussion about it on american-dominated subreddits . 
  please do feel free to ask any related or follow-up questions you have . 
  we moved away from a single player healthcare system in 2005 under a right wing-led coalition government . 
  i was sceptical at first , but we 've been able to avoid the healthcare cost explosion that seems to plague a lot of our neighbouring countries ( and the us , for that matter ) without significant drops in quality or availability of care . 
  there 's real innovation and market pressure going on without losing the essence of the welfare state . 
  i would n't be surprised if more countries went our route in the future . 
  single payer may be all hip and happening today , but i have a feeling we might be ahead of the pack here . 
  but ` respectfully educating ' implies that they 're wrong , and that 's what we 're disagreeing about !, 
  they 're using the word in the sense that it 's defined in dictionaries and the sense that it 's universally understood , and you 're telling them they 're wrong simply because you want the dictionary definition to be something else . 
  you 're going around telling brits , americans and all the other native speakers that their dictionaries are wrong , that they are using their own bloody language incorrectly , that you should have the final say on what words in their language mean simply because it 's a word that 's sometimes used to talk about you . 
  ca n't you see how arrogant that is ? 
  as a dutchman : in my personal opinion , nothing . 
  the nuances of the word ` holland ' * in dutch * are very complicated and confusing and can have a negative connotation depending on the status of the speaker , his geographical origin , the type of dutch he speaks , and the subject matter . 
  some people apply those nuances to the usage of the word in english , and i consider that a mistake . 
  the notion that words carry the same subtexts and nuances across different languages is absurd , and it should be obvious that foreigners do n't know about and do n't intend to convey the hidden meanings some dutchmen are taking offence at . 
  i disagree with / u/yosoyunpayaso : in dutch , i 'm only from the netherlands . 
  in english i 'm from both holland and the netherlands . 
  still , i 'd advise against using the word ` holland ' in english , but only because you 'll get some angry internet keyboard warriors chasing you , not because a majority of dutchmen objects to it or because it 's objectively wrong . 
  a close friend of mine is filipino , but they 're quite rare here and would mostly be taken for more common east-asian minorities like chinese , vietnamese or indonesian at first glance . 
  all of those groups have a good reputation , though , and he does n't feel discriminated against regardless of whether he 's actually identified as filipino . 
  i only have 1 friend from that region that has ever experienced problems with discrimination : he 's 1/4 indonesian , and as a result he has darker hair and a slightly darker skin tone than most other dutchmen ... just like moroccans , and there have been some minor encounters in cases where he was mistaken for one . 
   as a result the moluccans have still kept very much to themselves , apart from the odd act of terrorism now and again , but what 's a train or primary school hostage situation now and then on the grander scale of things ... that 's mostly back in the 70 's , though , and there are n't many issues any more . 
  no , this is very much a cultural construct , and american ideas on skin colour can be difficult to follow for us sometimes . 
  it 's actually the reverse - native speakers are often much more accepting of informal and agrammatical language usage . 
  an american is much more likely to consider a sentence like `` ai n't got no life '' correct , for example , while you and i would intuitively object to that because we 've been taught the language so formally . 
  you sound insulted !, 
  i feel that quiz does n't really work well for non-americans . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.gameswithwords.org/whichenglish ) by the university of cambridge goes a bit further - it tries to identify where you 're from if you are n't a native speaker . 
  it correctly guesses the netherlands for me , and i have no idea how . 
  welfare is $ 928,29 a month base pay . 
  on top of that you get $ 48,86 vacation pay , $ 88 health insurance assistance , up to $ 354 rent assistance , and children assistance if you have kids . 
  there 's also special welfare , for big financial setbacks that you ca n't afford while living on welfare without an emergency fund . 
  this means that you 'll get a new fridge or laptop if your current one breaks . 
  i like your question , but i ca n't think of any . 
  there 's a club for every sport that i 'm remotely interested in in my city , including stuff like mountaineering that requires significant travel because it is n't possible anywhere near here . 
  no , not really . 
  i reject the notion that history education can or should be comprehensive , and i do n't think we 're neglecting the black pages of our own history . 
  i like the balance between the various eras too . 
  there 's only 1 negative thing i have to say about my local government : they can be somewhat bureaucratic , the digital revolution has n't quite reached the lower levels fully . 
  i can file my national taxes via app , but there 's still paper involved for my local taxes . 
  for some things i actually have to physically show up at a desk somewhere . 
  trust , though ? 
  full . 
  meetings , procedures and processes are transparent and accountable , and there are information and input meetings for any significant decisions and changes . 
  i consider this an international website , and as a result i 'd like everyone to put in some effort to smooth over cultural differences in subreddits without a specific audience . 
  i 'm well aware that most americans disagree with that premise and do n't act upon it . 
  i also think that most americans do n't realise just how american many subreddits are - it 's easy to miss how american places like / r/atheism and / r/relationships are if it 's your home culture , i suppose . 
  i 'm hoping some germans will chime in , i 've heard very positive stories about the recent developments in bremen and hamburg . 
  the answer here in the netherlands is ` true , for now ' , but it 's a way more nuanced story than that and the conviction is n't final , both parties appealed . 
  ** the incident : ** at a campaign meeting in 2014 geert wilders asked his audience : `` do we want more or do we want less moroccans in this country ? 
  '' , and his audience roared `` less !, 
  less !, 
  less ! '' . 
  he nuanced this sentenced the next day , saying he only meant * criminal * moroccans . 
  ** the charge : ** it 's illegal to insult groups of people in the netherlands , and the public prosecution service felt wilders had crossed a line here . 
  [ the press release about the charge is available in english here on their official site ] ( https://www.om.nl/algemeen/english/@96787/dutch-public/ ) , i feel it 's quite a readable piece . 
  he was charged with a fine of $ 5000 . 
  ** the trial : ** last december a dutch court convicted him without punishment of hate speech . 
  they found the public prosecution 's arguments convincing but felt he had been punished enough by the whole trial . 
  ** the appeal : ** under dutch law both sides can appeal , and in this case both did . 
  the public prosecution service feels this was serious enough to warrant punishments , wilders feels he did n't cross a line . 
  the appeal is scheduled for next november . 
  a couple of important nuances : 1 . 
  this issue splits the dutch populace roughly down the middle . 
  due to our implementation of the separation of powers the current government has no influence on what the prosecution service does in individual cases . 
  the original charges and the decision to appeal are n't and can not be politically motivated , and due to the amount of attention this is generating for wilders and the electoral gain he 's drawing from this it 's probable the government would actually oppose prosecution if they * did * have anything to say about it . 
  the opportunity to appeal of the public prosecution service will look very strange to some , especially to americans . 
  double jeopardy , the legal principle that you ca n't be tried multiple times for 1 crime , is very important in our justice system too , but appeals are considered part of the first ` run ' . 
  free speech is considered a fundamental right and essential for a functioning democracy here . 
  hate speech legislation in general and this trial in particular should n't be taken as evidence of the opposite - it 's considered the least infringing compromise to protect other fundamental rights and protect life , liberty and happiness of everyone , not something we 've done lightly . 
  roughly two thirds of university students no longer live with their parents here . 
  university owned dorms are very rare , but most do live in some form of shared housing .
