  what 's an adult lunch drink ? 
  most days are work days , so a button down shirt and cotton pants . 
  i usually lunch quite extensively . 
  [ here are 3 examples from just last week ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ndiro ) , apologies for the shitty picture quality . 
  people talking in the silent train carriage on my commute 4 . 
  relaxed 5 . 
  do n't really have an answer 6 . 
  not paying enough attention when someone introduces themselves and immediately forgetting their name, 
  i live in a reasonably sized ( 200k people ) city that 's quite typical for the dutch urban experience . 
  according to 1 popular delivery site at least 102 places deliver to my house : * 39 pizza places ( 36 italian , 3 american-style ) * 22 burger places ( but a majority of them really shitty ) * 15 spareribs * 13 chinese ( which means mostly indonesian here ) * 11 turkish there 's also restaurants advertising dutch , balkan , japanese , greek , thai , mexican , vietnamese , indonesian , indian , italian , surnam , american , and egyptian food , and i 'm sure i 'm missing some . 
  obviously more cuisines are available in town , but they do n't deliver or at least do n't advertise on the most popular sites . 
  i 'd expect easy access to at least chinese , turkish and italian pizza in most of the country . 
  what 's your delivery list looking like , op ? 
  i 'm curious how they compare . 
  i read about 1 book a week . 
  my most recent 3 books were kurt vonnegut 's * slaughterhouse five * , garry kasparov 's * winter is coming * , and orson scott card 's * speaker for the dead * . 
  i really liked the latter 2 of those . 
  some personal favourites by genre : ** classic detective : ** * the mysterious affair at styles * by agatha christie . 
  a great old whodunnit that 's aged much better than most of its pre-wwii peers . 
  ** modern thriller : ** * rainbow six * by tom clancy . 
  clever plot , well-paced thriller about the adventures of an anti-terrorism unit . 
  ** sf : ** * the gods themselves * by isaac asimov . 
  not his best-known work , but my favourite book involving aliens . 
  ** russian : ** * in the first circle * by aleksandr solzhenitsyn . 
  a bit more accessible than some of the other great russian literature in my opinion and a great example of his style . 
  no no , we got separate paths for black people !, 
  please keep the american questions , they 're my favourites !, 
  i really like the opportunities to talk about european perspectives on things like hate speech and other controversial topics without getting overwhelmed by american vitriol and downvotes , like i get in askreddit and askanamerican . 
  this subreddit gets a lot of its value and appeal from that , at least for me . 
  i did n't even realise there was a tv show ... 
   all stars was this that popular ? 
  i 've never seen it and i do n't think i 'm anywhere near the only one , lots of people around me never watch dutch films at all . 
  i 'd certainly add [ bassie en adriaan ( link in english ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qazzbfoyyea ) to the list , a show about the adventures of a clown and an acrobat . 
       the supreme court issues rulings on laws and cases based on agreement or conflict with the constitution . 
  is that not similar to your country 's highest courts ? 
  that 's not the same in the netherlands . 
  a mere court deciding that abortions are legal or blacks are people would be a highly illegal overreach here . 
  those are legislative matters , i 'd feel extremely uncomfortable to leave that in the hands of unelected officials . 
  large questions like that deserve the input of the populace . 
  i 'm aware of all of that , and it was a really nice attempt for the time , i just do n't see how it 's relevant here . 
  religious tolerance and individual freedom had been important values in my country for 250 years before the us existed , gradually became more codified and explicit during its existence , and still exist today . 
  i 'm sure it 's an important document in how americans view rights , but that 's because it 's * your * amended constitution . 
  the ideas are older than the us , and although i recognise the specifics of the implementation as a serious intellectual feat we did n't copy your specific implementation of the separation of power , institutions , or law system , they 're innovations that just never affected my corner of the world at all . 
  i 'd call reddit as a whole right wing , yes . 
  just a consequence of the amount of americans in most subreddits . 
  the dutch people on reddit lean more left than our general population , though , and this subreddit is quite left wing . 
   also , the bill of rights merely protects these rights , rather than granting them outright . 
  that seems to be misunderstood . 
  this is a huge cultural gap and a cause for many of the confused replies here . 
  we take `` we , the people '' rather more literally , the elected government * is * the dutch people in a very real sense , and my government `` granting rights to me '' simply means that i , through my government , just gave myself a pat on the back . 
  the distinction just does n't make sense in cultures without an antagonistic view of the government - the very slight nuance between me telling myself that some rights are so important that i do n't intend to ever take them away from myself on the one side , and the idea that those rights are somehow intrinsic and i do n't really need to tell myself that on the other side just seems like philosophical mumbo jumbo without any practical relevance to most people here . 
  in my opinion free speech , justice , the right to vote and all the rest of it are utterly fundamental to human rights and functioning democracy . 
  i can see the value of writing that down in american culture , but this question just does n't really translate to my world . 
  i 've contacted my representative in the county council recently with an issue . 
  they agreed with my view and within 14 days they had filed formal questions to the mayor in a council meeting , i 'm very happy with the speed at which my issue is being addressed . 
  national and european elected members tend to be quite approachable , but i 've never done so myself . 
  i make a very conscious choice in elections and i 'm rarely unhappily surprised by their voting behaviour . 
  in the case of dutch education you should n't take this as an entire lack of relevance or interest . 
  there 's a large focus on historiography and examples here rather than a complete overview - general historic trends , some major aspects of each time period , how to judge a primary or secondary source , that 's it . 
  it 's just not necessary to drag lithuania into a narrative to explain the cold war , wwii , or middle ages , and there are usually more salient examples to dutch kids . 
  there 's already way too much history and things are placed in a more familiar context where possible . 
  i can talk about what i know of lithuanian history , but i do n't think it showed up in my formal education at all . 
  but did you know that gert-jan segers lived in egypt for 7 years ? 
  only some brownie points ? 
  that 's rather niggardly . . 
  they certainly get less distinctive , but i tend to interpret that as british . 
  i 'm often surprised when i find out certain artists are american , because they sing like english people do . 
  i do n't consider the neutral singing voice as american at all . 
  source ? 
  most english language singers sound more neutral , which is something entirely different to me . 
  a vaasje , also widely known as an amsterdammer , has been 25cl for ages , right ? 
  i do n't think i 've seen any 33cl glasses in years , it 's certainly not the default . 
  25cl is normal in every pub , restaurant and club i 've been to in the past years . 
  there are 2 senses in which the term `` freedom of speech '' is used , either the more narrow american definition that 's about just the content of speech or a broader definition that 's common in europe that includes related rights that allow you to actually get heard and exchange meaningful speech without oppression : press freedom , whistle-blower protection , internet access , striking rights , privacy , pseudonymity , etc. 
  `` freedom of expression '' is a synonym of that broader definition . 
  incidentally , this is one of those language divides that often causes conflict on reddit . 
  americans are incredulous that european nations claim to have freedom of speech while the content is clearly more restricted , europeans often feel that they have * more * freedom of speech because all those other things in the broader definition are generally much better protected here . 
  the other point of view is suddenly much more reasonable if you 're aware of the differing definitions . 
  i think it 's deserved trust , a result of our system working well for us , and / u/bravasphotos ' opinion is widely shared here among educated people . 
  i trust the vast majority of politicians to do their job with integrity and honour , i trust that our elected bodies represent our electorate accurately , and i have complete faith in the impartiality and accountability of our court and justice system . 
  that 's not to say our government functions perfectly or that some things should n't be changed , there 's inefficiency and mistakes , but i believe the vast majority of bureaucrats and representatives work hard to achieve what they feel is best for the country as a whole . 
  it should be noted that my trust is no longer universally shared like it once was , there 's growing distrust of both institutions and politicians among populist parties and especially low educated voters that support them . 
  nice ones !, 
  i feel like i get these , but please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  they 're plays on scottish pronunciation , and i believe the explanations of the puns would be :  a glaswegian woman goes to the dentist and sits down in the chair . 
  '' * come far * ? 
  '' , asks the dentist . 
  `` govan '' ( * neighbourhood in glasgow , so ` no ' * ) , she replies . 
   how can you tell the difference between bing crosby and walt disney ? 
  bing sings but walt * does nae ( not ) * . 
   a man goes into a bakery , points to the display and asks , `` is that a doughnut or * am i wrong * '' and the baker replies , `` no , you 're right , it 's a doughnut . '', 
   there are two cows in a field - which one is on holiday ? 
  the one with the * week off * . 
  most grudges related to wwii were a lot closer to home . 
  people resented the germans for killing a loved one , making their children go hungry , complicating their lives . 
  it 's about their awful experiences and all the fun things they could n't do . 
  i mean , of course there 's treaties and governments and other higher level stuff , but even the holocaust did n't cause as much hate as the simple disruptions of your own life . 
  you might see parallels of this in your own country 's politics - there 's a * huge * difference in people 's response to issues that have deep importance to their personal lives and more distant stuff , no matter their relative importance on any objective scale . 
  in our wwii case , this has also been the reason why wwii wounds have healed so well . 
  the people with a very personal connection to the war have mostly passed away , and newer generations have held most political power for decades .
