  your confusion probably arises from * european * federalism , which is the idea that in the future the eu would be better off as a federation , with more powers shifted from the current national governments to european institutions and current sovereign nations reduced to some kind of states . 
  that 's highly controversial but possibly happening sometime in the far future . 
  apologies if i get any of the american usages wrong , but i 'll try to name some . 
  let me know if any of these are unclear , i 'm sacrificing some nuance here . 
  ** liberal ** : us : left-wing eu : political centre , market-oriented ** republican ** : us : 1 of the 2 political parties eu : anti-monarchy ** nationalism ** : us : a stronger , more negatively loaded form of patriotism eu : a desire for more autonomy for a region or country and my favourite : ** tabling a motion ** : us : * refusing * to discuss a proposal eu : * starting * the discussion about a proposal, 
  i know all of them , but that 's not common here . 
  i 've been on reddit long enough to pretty much hold the reddit-american stereotypes , i suppose . 
  even the dictionary , that historical british thing , is rude about essex girls , [ even though they 're massive fans of it !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eexdn3evyis ), 
  i love how our languages work , both of those swedish words exist in dutch with the same meaning - * aanleiding * and * grienen * . 
  i consume a lot of british media so i 'm able to differentiate some of the accents from each other . 
  i generally have no trouble comprehending people on the bbc , but some of my friends have trouble with some stronger accents . 
  i 'm generally able to broadly place an accent , but it 's of course easier if it 's more prominent and i generally ca n't distinguish subtypes . 
  i usually have little trouble placing a geordie , yorkshire , or west country accent , but i ca n't really distinguish between types of scottish and usually take a couple of sentences to identify welsh unless it 's really strong . 
  i 've grown a lot milder on it in the past few years . 
  it provides comfort to people , i enjoy the traditions , i see a lot of cultural value , the community element , i love the art . 
  i feel like i used to close my eyes too quickly to the secular value that organised religion brings to my country . 
  half a liter is n't a common amount of beer to order , but it 's usually available and i 'd expect to pay $ 4 - $ 6 for a heineken , our bud light , depending on location . 
  around 19 on either christmas day here . 
  they 're equally important , the larger meal varies from year to year and depends on the company on both days . 
  some people deliberately plan a simple kale dish , stamppot boerenkool , on either day because they dislike extravagance , but i 've seen that happen on both days too . 
  almost everyone goes for something fancy at least one of the days . 
  are third and fourth christmas day a thing in other countries ? 
  we sometimes continue for more than two days , with so many divorcees people ca n't always fit all the family in just two days . 
  both christmas days are definitely more important . 
  barely anyone observes the eve at all , that 's a devout christian thing only , but the two days are the most significant and observed holidays of the year . 
  i got one !, 
  essential for every home . 
  it does n't . 
  fix your flair , dude !, 
  i 'm not sure whether i ever watched that 70 's show , but i 'm vaguely aware it exists . 
  i do n't think i 've ever discussed it with someone else . 
  have never heard of the other one . 
  most of the convenience of working with si units is because of the easy relations . 
  1 litre of water weighs 1 kg and had a volume of 1 m3 . 
  if i want to raise the temperature of that water 1 degree celsius i need 1 cal of energy . 
  that just makes it feel much more intuitive to me , but i was of course raised with this system . 
  there 's no need to look that far back . 
  countries like germany , sweden or the netherlands have a higher percentage of foreign born population and more second generation immigrants than the us as well , it 's not just a historic thing . 
  most countries are less homogeneous than the us , and that 's an important part of why it 's so controversial here . 
  we have serious issues with minority groups standing outside society , and stuff like jihadists shows it 's not something we can ignore . 
  i 'm still very much in favour of multiculturalism , but you should realise it 's a much more severe problem here . 
  the american solution no longer works here . 
  1000 would be a huge school here . 
  the dutch average is 730 students for ages 13-18 , so 6 grades rather than your 4, 
  what is aleppo ? 
  it 's certainly the defining dutch trait , whether it 's something foreigners * admire * ... 
  the schools identify as simply ` christian ' , and they would be the type of schools a catholic in the north might go to , but yeah , i suppose a majority of the actually religious people there would be protestants . 
  the more devout protestants go to separate reformed schools , though . 
  that 's odd , i would consider it one of the most common and noticeable differences between christian and public schools . 
  i 'm from up north , but i thought this was fairly universal . 
  a lot of christian schools have a dagopening , a usually biblical or motivational 15 minute story or discussion before regular classes . 
  depending on the school it may be a central message or just something that teachers prepare themselves . 
  holland - quite common , but the use in dutch is very nuanced . 
  england - extremely common . 
  i suppose it 's a leftover from our ancient rivalry with just the english . 
  people do use the names of other parts of the uk correctly , e.g. 
  a holiday to scotland , but english is often used when the whole uk or gb is meant . 
  yankee - it would certainly be universally understood . 
  it 's not that common . 
  tabling a motion means starting to discuss it in the rest of the world - you put it on the negotiating table in the centre of attention , so to speak . 
  very true . 
  even many core terms mean entirely different things : liberal , democracy , republic , it 's just something else here . 
  sometimes it 's even the literal reverse , `` to table a motion `` means the exact opposite here . 
  at least i now know to add `` politically correct `` to that growing list !, 
  pc is associated with some parts of the political establishment , but cultural appropriation just is n't a thing here . 
  i think your error is equating the two . 
  i would n't say this sub is particularly left-leaning , by the way . 
  looking at the dutch comments here i certainly get a strong anti-populist vibe , but it 's mostly explaining current government policy , which is right wing too . 
  i feel you might be interpreting some opinions as left wing when they are held by our centre-right too . 
  i 'm 1m90 , 6 ' 3 , which is only slightly above the dutch average . 
  i suppose i 'm somewhat tall , but not enough to draw comments here . 
  it 's sometimes a concern abroad , as that 's taller than many countries plan for , but i 'm easily within the range of dutch clothing , beds , doors , and the like . 
  i do n't know many people that are really concerned with their height , but i have a friend that 's 5 ' 1 and she has some trouble outside her house , for example quite a lot of mirrors in bathrooms are too high for her to use . 
  dutch society is no longer adjusted to people that short . 
  of course , she 's perfectly fine in a lot of other countries !, 
  where did you move from ? 
  that might be helpful if you want some decent advise . 
  here in the north regional politicians are quite well known locally , especially ones that champion local causes like the earthquake issues . 
  some like relus ter beek and max van den berg achieved a huge celebrity status here . 
  i 'd say indonesia , our colonial history has resulted in many links . 
  we 've got our share of rural farm villas , but most dutch rich live in what you 'd probably call suburbs , although we usually see these as small satellite towns in their own right that happen to be in easy travelling distance of cities . 
  there are differences , though , as a lot of inner cities are also very desirable and expensive real estate . 
  the medieval houses on amsterdam 's primary canals can cost millions and their inhabitants are known as the ` grachtengordelelite ' , canal belt elite , and considered very much upper class . 
  it 's the place to be for the left-leaning intellectual elite , with all the museums and cultural life of amsterdam within bicycling distance so you do n't need to use your environmentally unfriendly car . 
  i suppose you see the same in areas of the us where space is at a huge premium like new york , that 's certainly a much better comparison than dallas or st. louis as i understand them . 
  most people just use the english words around me . 
  i 'd interpret a translated version as an ironic usage . 
  certainly , standard flemish has an air of elegance and refinement . 
  some of the more local accents lack that , though . 
  i do n't think so , the only call in stuff on tv here involves shady quiz and astrology shows in the middle of the night . 
  a free market oriented society involves a focus on privatisation and deregulation . 
  that 's an entirely separate issue from the corporate tax rate ( or `` theft '' as you seem to prefer to call it ) . 
  we like our high tax rate , thank you very much . 
  that 's just the government , though , and political leanings are relative within a country . 
  i 'd say the netherlands as a country qualifies as solidly left wing in an international context even under our current center-right government . 
  it 's a compulsory and separate class for at least 6 years here . 
  where in the uk are you from ? 
  i ca n't figure out an accent were the difference would only be slight . 
  in our public transport system we normally use trains for longer distances , certainly when travelling for over an hour .
