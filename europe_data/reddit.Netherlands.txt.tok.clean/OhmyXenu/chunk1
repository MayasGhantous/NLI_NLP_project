the moment they hire more people to patrol the borders all funding is cut . 
  the moment they build a refugee camp all funding is cut . 
  the moment they so much as bring this up all funding is cut since they questioned the policy . 
  you 've still failed to provide any evidence that the above statements you made are likely/true . 
  in fact , reality shows a different picture . 
  when greece asked for help with the refugees , they were n't instantly reprimanded and had `` all funding cut '' . 
  they were instead given 473 million euro 's . 
  from this site you obviously like : http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/08/10/european-commission-approves-473-million-euros-to-greece-for-migration-crisis/ so yeah , hyperbole . 
   the austerity cuts asked for heavy reductions to the military funds . 
  everyone yelled at them for not doing that . 
  which made complete sense , considering greece is in some sort of military pissing match with turkey resulting in silly things like this : http://www.businessinsider.com/what-greece-to-buy-400-tanks-from-the-us-2011-10?op=1&amp;ir=t tanks in a country that 's as mountainous as greece and is also in large part made up of a flipping archipelago . 
  yeah that makes sense . 
   did everyone suddenly forget that greece is not allowed to spend a single euro to anything not outlined in the new austerity package ? 
  the moment they hire more people to patrol the borders all funding is cut . 
  the moment they build a refugee camp all funding is cut . 
  the moment they so much as bring this up all funding is cut since they questioned the policy . 
  is europe going completely mental or something ? 
  holy hyperbole batman !, 
  if you 're going to make outrageous claims like these , you should probably come with some evidence to support them . 
  you 're seriously saying if greece asked for help with border-issues the deal that has held europe in its grip for months will instantly go kapoof ? 
  yeah , colour me sceptical . 
   whenever you hear about the higher prevalence of mental disorders among gays , you do n't equate that with gays being mental patients . 
  external stressors play a large role here obviously . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minority_stress i ca n't think of anything similar for homophobes . 
  but wo n't no one think of the poor job creators ? 
  i 'm sure it 'll start trickling down any day now . 
  i love this quote by ronald wright : `` socialism never took root in america because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires . '', 
  since - apparently - that is your fetish ... 
  enjoy : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq5dr-on0em#t=00m40s edit : and yes , that 's daytime dutch television . 
  yup . 
   most are not caught . 
  mainly because the police just watches and does nothing . 
  http://www.telegraaf.nl/feed/article24301620.ece/binary/q/img_pag4_plundering_vrac_2_1_hr18g186.jpg [ dutch lorry getting it 's contents plundered whilst a cop literally just stands there and watches . 
  i suspect the cop would n't have been so laissez-faire about things had it been a french truck . 
  in other words that 40 % is first generation only . 
   the worst thing is that people now actually associate homofobia with immigrants . 
  http://www.politie.nl/binaries/content/assets/politie/documenten-algemeen/publicaties-archief/anti-homogeweld-in-nederland.pdf an immigrant population of 20 % commits 40 % of anti-gay crime . 
  and this is from a report that 's quite skewed in favour of immigrants . 
  that association you mention really is n't that unreasonable . 
  * an agreement was made with the us at the request of london and paris that un airstrikes were not to be used against bosnian-serb troops . 
  all three countries kept the agreement secret . 
  * the attack on sebrenica by bosnian-serb troops started the 6th of july . 
  then dutchbatcommander thom karremans requested airsupport multiple times . 
  the un 's response was negative every time . 
  the enclave fell on the 11th of july . 
  afterwards , thousands of muslim men were killed by bosnian-serb troops under the command of general ratko mladic . 
  * in voorhoeve 's opinion many of the victims could have been spared if there had been proper airsupport , as was provided later at the enclave of gorazde . 
  * yeah , great way to treat your allies . 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/13_07_15eurosummit.pdf  the above listed commitments are minimum requirements to start the negotiations with the greek authorities . 
  however , the euro summit made it clear that the start of negotiations does not preclude any final possible agreement on a new esm programme , which will have to be based on a decision on the whole package ( including financing needs , ** debt sustainability ** and possible bridge financing ) . 
  sounds to me like it 's something to be discussed when the deal actually gets finalized after greece has implemented the prerequisite reforms . 
  i thought it was already agreed that there was going to be debt restructuring . 
  [ greek pm says secured debt restructuring to avoid `` grexit '' ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/13/eurozone-greece-tsipras-idusa8n0zj01120150713 ), 
  colour me sceptical with regards to hr managers everywhere learning mandarin so they can use some chinese search engine to check up on their prospective employees . 
  bing has a right to be forgotten form as well . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28343060 i 'm just saying that people probably do n't care so much if their information is still searchable through some incredibly obscure search-engine . 
  in an only slightly related note : google 's market share in europe is just ridiculous . 
  how many people in the countries that have the right to be forgotten are going to be using baidu for their searches ? 
   so far only the uk and italy have followed the eu rules on the matter , and for doing so have been punished by increased membership fees . 
  the netherlands needed to pay extra dues as well and paid the full amount - which was higher than the uk 's proportionally speaking - months ago . 
  ca n't find an english source , sorry : http://www.nu.nl/economie/3911030/nederland-krijgt-forse-naheffing-eu-afdracht.html, 
  do you have any kind of plan for getting any proposed greek stimulus through the parliaments of countries that have lower living standards than greece does ? 
  yeah . 
  i thought not . 
  erm ... you 're gon na have to come up with some sort of source if you 're going to make the claim that greece 's levels of tax avoidance are perfectly normal compared to other countries . 
   well , everything imported , from gasoline to bananas to iphones will essentially triple in price as to essentially be unaffordable for your average salary man . 
  this is where the real misery begins . 
  does n't greece also imports most of it 's pharmaceuticals ? 
  that sounds a lot more painful than a flipping iphone . 
   where are the start ups ? 
  where are the entrepreneurs ? 
  why are all the best minds leaving ? 
  these questions are just as relevant for a great many other european countries - none of which have the same history as greece . 
   very true , jeronimo martins relocating to the netherlands . 
  is that solely due to taxes ? 
   jmr has been run as a 51 % -49 % joint venture with the dutch firm ahold since 1992  it also has industrial facilities focused on the production of several unilever brands . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jer%c3%b3nimo_martins it seems to have pretty strong ties to dutch companies . 
  do n't think it 's all that different in the uk or in the rest of the eu , tbh . 
  there are some numbers for 2013 and 2014 from a suicide prevention ngo in that article . 
  they clearly show a decrease compared to the 2012 numbers from the who . 
  2012 was actually a peak year according to [ this ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/09/12/suicide-rate-in-greece-decreases/ ) . 
  why the hubbub about greek suicide rates ? 
  according to the 2012 numbers they have some of the lowest suicide rates in the entire world . 
  he even used the word comrade to describe the greek politician he talked to . 
   a standard of living that stopped existing in the us nearly a century ago . 
  he was obviously responding to this part of / u/lolmonger 's comment . 
   4 ) the cost of living is way lower in romania than in greece ugh . 
  people keep posting this link as if it instantly proves their point that greece has it soooo much worse than everybody else . 
  yeah , no . 
  wages are more than twice as high in greece , whilst rent is only 10-33 % higher and most basic goods are hovering around +60 % . 
  that really does n't compare . 
  which bears out if you look at the quality of life index on that site you love linking : [ romania ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/country_result.jsp?country=romania ) :  quality of life index : 107.98 [ greece ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/country_result.jsp?country=greece )  quality of life index : 131.76, 
   junker claimed his proposal did n't have any pension cutting period . 
  i ca n't find that in this particular article . 
  all i can find is :  jean-claude juncker said he felt betrayed , and suggested that alexis tsipras was lying to his people about cuts in wages and pensions . 
  nothing about zero cuts in wages and pensions . 
   where are we going to find the 1 % of gdp from pensions during 2016 he 's asking for ? 
  http://europa.eu/rapid/attachment/ip-15-5270/en/list%20of%20prior%20actions%20-%20version%20of%2026%20june%2020%2000.pdf the proposals under `` pension reform '' are all together supposed to come to the 1 % gdp cut - according to the creditors anyway . 
  it is n't those measures * and * on top of that a 1 % cut . 
  now you 're just throwing up imaginary hurdles .
