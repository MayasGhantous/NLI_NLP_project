  it 's a big investor in turkey and jeopardizing that with turkey 's current economic climate is perhaps not the smartest thing to do . 
   dutch entrepreneurs topped the list of foreign investors in turkey in 2014 , as the number of foreign companies exceeded 41,000 http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/tr/originals/2015/01/turkey-foreign-investment-profile.html, 
  goodbye person making outrageous claims with no proof to back it up . 
  stay silent or provide a source next time , please . 
  not a single article exists of dutch youth firebombing cars because the local community centre is n't being refurbished to their liking , holding violent rallies for dutch politicians , having low workplace participation due to language deficiencies or any of the other myriad signs of poor integration shown by some ethnic minorities in the netherlands . 
  that complete absence is your proof . 
  yes . 
  yes they are . 
  show me proof otherwise . 
   and to compare : the dutch themselves integrate poorly . 
  in australia for example , with old people homes where only dutch is spoken . 
  are all poorly integrated turks in the netherlands old , first generation immigrants like the dutch people you 're describing ? 
  that answer is most definitely no . 
  and ... ? 
  that website has existed for years when the land registry was most assuredly * not * finished . 
  i still see no evidence that it 's finished now . 
  they were prepping a supposedly final push to complete the land registry in september 2016 . 
  ca n't find anything about it 's completion . 
  http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1153161/long-awaited-land-registry-in-greece-apparently-heading-into-final-stretch-of-completion sorry , but ... 
   there is one . 
  erm . . no there is n't ? 
  last report was that it was going to be completed in 2020 , but then later that was pushed back due to lack of funds . 
   under the new syriza-government , greece has reiterated its pledge to finalise the land registry `` around 2020 '' . 
  nevertheless , on 20 january this year , greek daily kathimerini reported that the whole project `` may go on hold , '' due to lack of funds http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/reforming-greece-easier-said-done-never-ending-case-land-registry/ edit : why is it also still so hard to conduct business in greece ? 
  it 's # 61 ( was # 58 in 2015 even , so it 's going down ) in the [ ease of doing business ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ic.bus.ease.xq?year_high_desc=false ) index from the world bank . 
  eu average is 30 . 
  literally the only european countries that are worse than greece are the economic powerhouses of malta , san marino and bosnia-herzegovina . 
  are shipping companies paying taxes yet , or are they still protected in the constitution ? 
  a land registry would also be nice and would help with taxing land ownership . 
  was a bit of a [ disaster ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-cadastre-insight-iduskcn0sc0lh20151018 ) last time they tried to get that off the ground though . 
  then there 's the stuff that 's in the actual bail-out programs . 
   out of a total of 15 policy measures , called `` milestones '' in e.u. 
  jargon , apparently only two have been implemented so far . 
  https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/brussels-to-withhold-greek-bailout-money-601553 a few , short weeks later all the milestones were met . 
  a typical greek miracle , of course , in that they were signed into law on paper , with no intention of following up and actually implementing them . 
   if the eu had not destroyed the uks steel industry then it would not have been desirable for the uk to do this . 
  it 's not the eu doing that , it 's our own governments . 
   david cameron has been accused of failing the british steel industry after the government confirmed it was blocking proposals from other eu members to tackle dumping of cheap product by china . 
  and the benelux . 
  should n't the profits made in other countries be taxed at their rates then though , rather than ireland 's ? 
  also local politicians that blame everything bad on the eu and then turn around and take credit for everything good the eu does . 
  where are you getting this from ? 
  the 12 billion is owed entirely to the irish government . 
  the bill is a lot higher if you do n't take the transfer pricing thing into account , because ireland 's 12.5 % corporate tax-rate is a good deal lower than most rates on the continent . 
   both the scottish independence referendum and the uk eu membership referendum were once in a generation . 
  from the snp 's [ manifesto ] ( https://www.snp.org/constitution ) that it got elected on :  we believe that the scottish parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the scottish people -- or ** if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014 , such as scotland being taken out of the eu against our will . 
  ** it was once in a generation provided they were n't taken out of the eu against their will . 
  the current situation is literally mentioned in the snp 's manifesto that it got elected on though . 
   we believe that the scottish parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the scottish people -- or ** if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014 , such as scotland being taken out of the eu against our will . 
   really ? 
  you 're gon na cite huffington post ? 
  liberal lies . 
  you 're conveniently ignoring the wikipedia link that references a number of peer reviewed studies . 
  the huffington post story is a - surprisingly - good human interest story around this issue . 
   and you really are going to compare those women in leather with this ? 
  i chose that picture because i did not want to offend your sensibilities . 
  but if you insist ... 
  remember : this stuff happens out in the middle of the street , just like one of those horrible perverted gay pride parades . 
  very much nsfw : http://www.sfhog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/folsom-street-fair-2014-explicit-content-4.jpg http://m4.i.pbase.com/o9/53/344653/1/157574314.49yunwz9.crdsc05493.jpg http://www.sfhog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/folsom-street-fair-2014-explicit-content-8.jpg http://www.dagospia.com/img/foto/09-2014/folsom-street-fair-15-591237.jpg i 'm done debating with someone who is so obviously just pushing his own agenda though , but feel free to insist on having the last word if it makes you feel like you achieved some sort of victory . 
   you 're so in the wrong here , that i do n't even have the words to express it . 
  i know a lot of people who are only homophobic when given the chance ( like degenerates walking around in leather thongs ) but otherwise do n't have a single problem with people being gay . 
  so they only have a problem if the gay people are actually visible ? 
  yeah that 's just regular old homophobia . 
  it 's something that 's easy to hide when gay people are invisible . 
   this is one of the farthest from truth things i have ever heard this week , especially because it 's coming from a dutch . 
  and the use of the word `` nowadays '' makes me think that you believe that this is a recent thing , and gays are persecuted since recently . 
  yes , it 's really hard to survive as a non-straight person . 
  but only if you 're in a fucking muslim country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minority_stress http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/gay-loneliness/  yet they exist , and give the rest of the participants a bad name . 
  they only force homophobes to show their already present homophobia . 
   you make up for the harm being done by behaving like a normal person , demonstrating that you are not that different from a straight person and maybe then you can raise awareness about your rights , which exist and should be upheld . 
  the gay people wearing leather thongs * are * no different than straight people . 
  in the middle of the [ street ] ( https://www.fest300.com/system/images/w1siziisijiwmtqvmdkvmjmvmtgvndivmdavotuzl0zvbhnvbv9tdhjlzxrfrmfpcl8ymde0x0dpbwjlbf8yni5qcgcixv0/folsom_street_fair_2014_gimbel-26.jpg ) for god 's sake . 
   also i think that most of the gay community agrees with me when i say that they do more harm than good . 
  they do no harm whatsoever . 
  the people that object to any overt displays of homosexuality are n't going to become less homophobic by you going back into the closet , their homophobia just becomes slightly less visible . 
   sexuality should n't be a reason to pride yourself with . 
  surviving as a non-straight person in current modern society is most definitely an accomplishment one should be proud of . 
   especially in a more conservative country , gays should try to show that they are exactly like the rest and normal people . 
  and you do n't do that by dressing like a flaming idiot and behaving like a fucking degenerate on the streets . 
  you 've never actually been to a gay pride parade , have you ? 
  the men in leather thongs make up only a small number of participants . 
   gay parades should be banned because they harm the gay community . 
  it only takes the harm already being done to it and drags it kicking and screaming out into the light . 
  i actually think it 's a microcosm of everything that 's wrong with american politics . 
  [ amy klobuchar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amy_klobuchar#political_positions ) is generally treated as one of the rising stars of the democratic party and yet ...  when the healthy hungry-free kids act of 2010 raised the possibility that pizza would be eliminated from schools , threatening the $ 3 billion-dollar schwan company of minnesota , klobuchar petitioned the usda to protect frozen pizzas in school lunches . 
  this resulted in pizzas being counted as a vegetable . 
  so fucking over kids because frozen pizza pays for your election campaigns / brings a load of jobs into your state . . ? 
  same thing with cory booker and him voting against cheaper drugs because it might threaten pharmaceutical companies in his state of new jersey . 
  seems pretty icky to me . 
  [ according to the us congress ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/18/pizza-vegetable-congress-says-so ) pizza is a vegetable and that contains some tomato sauce too , so i dunno . 
  there was no security at the moment he was assassinated , because the aivd were so secure in the knowledge that he was safe that there had n't even been a proper risk-assessment . 
  https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2002/12/17/beveiliging-fortuyn-7618726-a1354072 and a protester did get close enough to throw a pie in his face just a month before he was killed . 
  i really do n't think a risk-assessment for a controversial politician like he was at the time is all that outlandish an idea . 
   dutch aivd insists they can protect him and other politicians on the campaign trail , even after this leak . 
  did n't they say the same thing of pim fortuyn ? 
  yeah ... 
  it 's literally part of the [ government 's manifesto ] ( https://www.snp.org/constitution ) that it got elected on :  we believe that the scottish parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the scottish people -- or ** if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014 , such as scotland being taken out of the eu against our will . 
  they are n't quite as visible because there 's so few of them . 
  this is the netherlands ' most wanted list : https://www.politie.nl/en/wanted-and-missing/most-wanted?page=1,
