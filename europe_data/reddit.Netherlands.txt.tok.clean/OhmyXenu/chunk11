   they 'll say whatever to get a certain voter base . 
  so stop listening to what he 's saying and watch what he 's doing . 
  appointing a secretary for education that wants to create '' [ god 's kingdom ] ( http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2016/12/04/devos-education-goal-advance-gods-kingdom/ ) '' using the education system . 
  and has [ donated large sums ] ( https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/02/07/despite-concern-over-anti-lgbt-donations-devos-confirmed-as-education-secretary/ ) to anti-lgbt + organizations in the past . 
  how well do you think that 's going to work out for lgbt + students ? 
  appointing an attorney general that 's vehemently anti-lgbt + and has a horrible civil rights . 
  he started [ working against lgbt + people ] ( https://thinkprogress.org/jeff-sessions-doj-transgender-rights-schools-fb105c1db30f ) in his first 15 minutes in office .

  let 's not get started on his candidate for the department of housing and urban development ben carson . 
  what about trump 's [ support for the first amendment defence act ] ( https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/issues-of-importance-to-catholics ) ? 
  you know the one . 
  where you get to discriminate against gay people but as long as you do it in the name of jeezus it 's perfectly okay . 
  i 'm sorry but the only way anyone can think trump and his cabinet are n't vehemently anti-lgbt + are if they are wilfully ignorant or if they are morons who believe his campaign spin ( that he himself then contradicted five minutes later ) . 
  surely the uk and france share some blame in this scenario as well . 
   where is the logic to keep such alliance when one of the side doesnt want to commit itaelf for it . 
  but they did commit . 
  all countries agreed to pay 2 % of gdp by 2024 . 
  per / u/woobz 's [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5u86q2/defense_secretary_mattis_issues_new_ultimatum_to/ddsb0 ni / ) :  `` in september 2014 , nato 's heads of state and government agreed at the wales summit to make an obligation out of what hitherto had only been a recommendation : to spend 2 % of their gdp on defence . 
  those who were spending less should undertake efforts to lift themselves to this level within ten years -- by 2024 '' https://www.iiss.org/en/militarybalanceblog/blogsections/2017-edcc/february-7849/counting-to-two-67c0 seems silly to get your panties in a bunch over something you previously agreed to do in several years not being quite done yet . 
  yeah . 
  on the same-sex marriage ruling by the supreme court :  it has been ruled upon . 
  it has been there . 
  if i 'm elected i would be very strong in putting certain judges on the bench that maybe could change thing , but they have a long way to go .

  i 've never quite understood this argument . 
  because there are already conservative religious nutjobs in the country - that we sadly ca n't throw out , we should just be happy to let in a lot more ? 
   this says the uk vetoed a one speed solution eurozone countries wanted a treaty change , so they 'd have more powers to help with fiscal integration of the eurozone . 
  one set of rules for the eurozone , one set of rules for countries not of the eurozone . 
  that 's the definition of two-speed , is n't it ? 
  so tweaks are needed . 
  that does n't justify scrapping the whole thing . 
   however by the time the plant was ready in 2015 the capture proces was considered too expensive and too inefficient . 
  i do n't get this . 
  are n't they contractually obligated to capture the co2 ? 
  how can companies just get out of this with no consequences just because they did n't do their homework in advance ? 
   it 's certainly not the fault of the british that the europeanists pushed integration through forced march the british should carry some blame . 
  first they push for continuous expansion and then they block a two-speed europe that was designed to fix the issues that come with that . 
  that certainly did n't help integration . 
  the majority are just different words for the same thing .

   negotiations for a region-to-region fta with asean were launched in 2007 and paused in 2009 to give way to bilateral ftas negotiations , conceived as building blocks towards a future region-to-region agreement . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/regions/asean/ does n't say why . 
  maybe conflicting national interests make it harder to strike a deal ? 
  taxes are also ridiculously high in some cases in greece . 
  it 's almost like the few people who do pay are asked to compensate for the ones who do n't , because the government is incapable of doing anything about the actual evasion of taxes . 
   so far , however , greece has only completed two of its 15 reform `` milestones '' that are necessary for creditors to begin a second bailout review ( the first of which was delayed and only completed in june ) which could lead to debt relief measures . 
  http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/09/greeces-bailout-progress-set-to-top-euro-zone-agenda.html does n't mention any specifics about the milestones though . 
  greece also magically passed all milestones a few weeks later . 
  though i 'm pretty sure that 's all on paper with nothing actually being set into motion . 
  it 's utterly adorable that you think the us is n't already doing this .

  [ running a casino into the ground ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/industry-us-trumpentertainment-bankruptc-idustre51g3pp20090217 ) in the pre-crisis boom-years shows that maybe donald trump is n't quite the business genius he wants you to think he is . 
  we could check and see how much he 's actually worth on his tax-returns of course , but he refuses to release them . 
  wonder why . 
  is it an actually realistic fear , or is it just a dick-measuring contest ? 
   they have been doing what told for a decade . 
  not really . . ? 
  just a few months ago :  so far , however , greece has only completed two of its 15 reform `` milestones '' that are necessary for creditors to begin a second bailout review ( the first of which was delayed and only completed in june ) which could lead to debt relief measures . 
  http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/09/greeces-bailout-progress-set-to-top-euro-zone-agenda.html of course a few weeks later the reforms were `` passed '' , but on paper only with no practical follow-up being done . 
  they 've never followed the prescription so you ca n't really blame it for failing . 
   honestly , i find polling on single market membership extremely untrustworthy because i think so few people really understand what it means . 
  these researchers agree with you . 
   equally , as noted earlier , it is perhaps unwise to assume that people will necessarily understand terms such as ` free trade ' or a ` single market ' and thus our fifth item refers to the possible continuation of the uk 's current level of access to the single market without using either of these terms . 
  so that 's taken into account . 
   wto rules . 
  here 's a quote about using wto rules from the director-general of the wto :  britain would face tortuous negotiations to fix the terms of its membership of the world trade organisation if it votes to leave the eu , its director-general has warned . 
   leading campaigners for brexit have proposed that the uk should leave the eu 's single market and could rely on wto rules to access european and other markets if it was unable to secure replacement trade deals . 
   but in an interview with the financial times , roberto azev\u00eado signalled this would not be straightforward . 
  he said a british exit from the eu would lead to unprecedented negotiations between the uk and the geneva-based institution 's 161 other members . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/745d0ea2-222d-11e6-9d4d-c11776a5124d does n't sound like that 's a sure thing either . 
   this was my preference and now seems to be the position of the uk government ** and the preference of uk voters ** . 
  what exactly do you base this on ? 
   today 's paper , the most comprehensive study yet undertaken of public attitudes towards the shape that brexit should take and published as part of the esrc-funded what uk thinks : eu project , shows that leave voters ( 90 % in favour ) are almost as keen as remain voters ( 94 % ) on staying in the single market . 
  that 's probably related to how closely something affects you personally . 
  as a gay guy when i read that a muslim minority of 1.8 % of the population does just as much gay-bashing as the natives who make up 81 % of the population , i do get a little bit concerned yes . 
  let 's keep calling it totally irrational fear that 's being trumped up for political gain . 
   trump came out in support of gay rights in the 80s that was in the 80 's . 
  now ... ? 
  from [ his own website ] ( https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/issues-of-importance-to-catholics ) :  if i am elected president and congress passes the [ first amendment defense act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_amendment_defense_act ) , i will sign it to protect the deeply held religious beliefs of catholics and the beliefs of americans of all faiths . 
  here 's a quote on that act :  on july 21 , 2015 , the los angeles times editorial board wrote that fada was `` unnecessary and could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians . 
  '' [ 6 ] later that year , walter olson of the cato institute wrote in newsweek that the bill does not `` try to distinguish rights from frills and privileges , '' and also criticized it for only protecting those who opposed same-sex marriage , not those who supported same-sex marriage or cohabitation or non-marital sex . 
  [ 7 ] it has also been criticized by ian s. thompson , legislative director for the american civil liberties union , who claimed that it would , if passed , `` open the door to unprecedented taxpayer-funded discrimination against lgbt people . '', 
  he 's [ against gay marriage ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/06/28/sotu-tapper-trump-is-for-traditional-marriage.cnn ) . 
  the people he [ plans to put on the supreme court ] ( http://time.com/4266700/donald-trump-supreme-court-nominations/ ) ( for life no less ) are people picked by the heritage foundation , which is notoriously anti-lgbt + . 
   speaking at the construction site for his new hotel in washington , d.c. , monday , trump said he will make a list public in the next week of 10 conservative judges that he would consider nominating to the supreme court . 
  if elected , trump said , he would only pick from that list , which is being made in consultation with the conservative heritage foundation . 
   `` i 'm going to submit a list of justices , potential justices of the united states supreme court , that i will appoint from the list , '' trump said . 
  `` i wo n't go beyond that list . 
  some people say maybe i 'll appoint a liberal judge . 
  i 'm not appointing a liberal judge . '' his cabinet is almost [ entirely anti-lgbt ] ( https://theintercept.com/2016/11/28/trump-may-not-be-anti-gay-but-much-of-his-senior-staff-is/ ) + . 
  judging by his words from the 80 's he 's totally down with the gays . 
  his actions in the last few months tell a different story . 
   congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal legal status with heterosexual marriage . 
   congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual 's as a `` discreet and insular minority '' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities . 
   congress should support the reauthorization of the ryan white care act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the hiv virus . 
  ** resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior . 
  ** http://web.archive.org/web/20010408125427/http://mikepence.com/issues.html so basically taking money out of hiv prevention and putting it into conversion camps instead . 
  he also thinks gay people should n't be allowed to get married and that it should be perfectly legal to deny someone any type of service for being gay , denying them housing for being gay , or firing them because they 're gay .
