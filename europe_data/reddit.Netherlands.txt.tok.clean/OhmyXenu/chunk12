  no biggie , right ? 
  like the list of supreme court picks that literally comes straight from the fucking heritage foundation ? 
   speaking at the construction site for his new hotel in washington , d.c. , monday , trump said he will make a list public in the next week of 10 conservative judges that he would consider nominating to the supreme court . 
  if elected , trump said , he would only pick from that list , which is being made in consultation with the conservative heritage foundation . 
  http://time.com/4266700/donald-trump-supreme-court-nominations/ because inviting one single gay guy to a meeting is obviously way more important than installing virulent homophobes that will fight against gay rights for the rest of their lives . 
  my only `` narrative '' is that republicans like making it more difficult to vote for minority voters , because that tends to hurt democrats . 
  as said , trump only won with 80.000 votes . 
  with that in mind , voter suppression of predominantly democratic voters is indeed relevant . 
  voter suppression of minorities also does n't help the democrats . 
  because burning shrubbery that can talk is n't at all ridiculous . 
  for a country that frowns on homo-sex , it 's a little ironic to see how a convicted child-rapist is treated . 
  the really desperate ones are probably still in camps in the region itself . 
  how much do the smugglers charge these days ? 
  http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2012/02/atrazine-syngengta-tyrone-hayes-jon-entine  he told me he gets `` almost all '' of his income from the genetic literacy project , which , he added , is funded by what he called the templeton and searle foundations . 
  founded by pharmaceutical and nutrasweet magnate daniel c. searle , the searle freedom trust funds all manner of conservative and free-market think tanks , including the manhattan and heartland institutes . 
  the searle freedom trust funds [ americans for prosperity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/americans_for_prosperity ) , the [ american enterprise institute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_enterprise_institute ) , the [ american legislative exchange council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_legislative_exchange_council ) ( alec ) , the [ heartland institute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_heartland_institute ) , [ state policy network ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_policy_network ) . 
  so he receives most of his funding from an organization that funds a ton of other organizations that do nothing but push corporate interests to the detriment of all else . 
  seems fishy to me . 
  yes , because they obviously carry just as much clout as the uk . 
  please . 
  not with the uk blocking such efforts , no . 
   i was judging canada as it exists presently , not by its past depredations ( a measure by which precious few countries would escape moral indictment ) . 
  it 's not just in the past . 
   by almost every measurable indicator , the aboriginal population in canada is treated worse and lives with more hardship than the african-american population . 
  all these facts tell us one thing : canada has a race problem , too . 
   how are we not choking on these numbers ? 
  for a country so self-satisfied with its image of progressive tolerance , how is this not a national crisis ? 
  a guy that prays ten times a day and refuses to let his daughters marry outside of their religion still makes me a little uncomfortable . 
   this statement is at the very least laughable for those who know well greek politics . 
  [ greek political scientists ] ( http://www.truth-out.org/speakout/item/34421-nepotism-plagues-greek-government-under-syriza?tmpl=component&amp;print=1 ) are saying the same thing . 
   the syriza-led government has hired scores of family members and friends of key government officials , a fact that has been well recorded in both the greek and foreign media . 
   but i bet all greeks be like ` dear \u0396\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 for once , please let him be a politician that does n't lie ' . 
  under tsipras ' lead syriza is just as involved in nepotism and clientelism as all other political parties before it , despite a great many campaign promises to root it out . 
  so i 'm pretty sure that ship has sailed already . 
   who 's anecdotal evidence will win ? 
  are police statistics anecdotal . . ? 
  there 's only ever been one , single study in the netherlands that looks at ethnicity - and indirectly religion - and homophobia . 
  the results were pretty stark . 
  36 % of suspects of violent homophobic crime in amsterdam are native dutch people , another 36 % are moroccans . 
  judging from your planned parenthood comment , i 'm assuming you 're an american . 
  in which case your comment is entirely pointless . 
  the muslims that are in the us are vastly different from the ones in large parts of europe . 
   the immigrants who have recently come to the united states are the most highly educated in history . 
  a new pew research center analysis of u.s. census bureau data shows that 41 % of immigrants arriving here in the past five years had completed at least a bachelor 's degree . 
  http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/05/todays-newly-arrived-immigrants-are-the-best-educated-ever/  foreign-born asian , european , and african immigrants had a higher educational attainment in terms of having earned a four-year college degree than their native-born counterparts . 
  according to the u.s census about 43.8 percent of african immigrants achieved the most college degrees , compared to 42.5 percent of asian-americans , 28.9 percent for immigrants from europe , russia and canada and 23.1 percent of the u.s. population as a whole . 
   only among hispanics and latinos was the proportion of college graduates larger among the native born population . 
   african immigrants have been the most highly educated group in the united states since the 1990s . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/educational_attainment_in_the_united_states#foreign_born_and_immigrants for a number of reasons immigrants to the us that have to actually cross an ocean to get there are a combination of highly educated and highly motivated to make something of themselves . 
   immigrant muslims are well represented among higher-income earners , with 19 percent claiming annual household incomes of $ 100,000 or higher ( compared to 16 percent for the muslim population as a whole and 17 percent for the u.s. average ) . 
  this is likely due to the strong concentration of muslims in professional , managerial , and technical fields , especially in information technology , education , medicine , law , and the corporate world . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_the_united_states the same simply can not be said of muslim immigrants to europe . 
  the refugees from syria ? 
  [ more than one in five school-aged refugee children in greece have never been to school , a study has revealed . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-children-dont-know-how-to-hold-a-pencil-a7042311.html ) as for the muslims that immigrated to my country under the guestworker schemes in the 60 's and 70 's , they were either moroccan berbers from the rif mountains or turks from the anatolian highlands . 
  both some of the least developed regions of their respective countries . 
  ** tl : dr : ** directly comparing college educated elites fleeing political persecution from lebanon and iran that migrated to the us with traditionally disadvantaged groups like - for instance - the moroccan gypsies and turkish hillbillies that emigrated to the netherlands is silly . 
  please stop doing it . 
   actions are what i care about like say % of suspects of gay-bashings . . ? 
  there 's only been one single study in the netherlands that looks at ethnicity - and indirectly religion - and homophobia . 
  the results were pretty stark . 
  36 % of suspects of violent homophobic crime in amsterdam are native dutch people , another 36 % are moroccans . 
  thumping a bible is a little different than kicking someone 's head in . 
  do n't give me this false equivalency horse-shit . 
  some emails from the head of the belgian nuclear authority to the commercial entity ( electrabel ) running these plants [ leaked ] ( https://www.1limburg.nl/woede-over-lakse-houding-exploitant-tihange ) a while ago . 
  * `` we 're very concerned with electrabel 's management of belgium nuclear powerplants and with the continuing lack of effort to improve security . 
  '' * * he further writes : `` at an unannounced inspection of tihange on the 9th of august it became clear that promised security measures had only been partially implemented . 
  '' * does n't look like just anti-nuclear hysteria to me . 
   no they were n't . 
      the decommissioning data was a political date implemented to get the green party to join a coalition . 
  they 're not at all relevant to the safety of the plant . 
  it 's just an arbitrary number . 
  then why does the wiki say the plants were designed with an operational lifetime of 30 years in mind ? 
  and that deal with the green party was just a one-time event , no ? 
  so why was the date extended first for all plants to 40 years and then when tihange-1 's time was up , the date was pushed back even further to 50 years ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the green 's were n't needed to form a coalition at every single one of these events . 
   this is a textbook case of media perception bias . 
  the belgian plants are not any less reliable or any more unsafe than plants elsewhere . 
  they do not have more incidents , or more severe incidents . 
  five incidents that caused the plants to close in the last year alone . 
  and this was in a year after there had already been several incidents and - as you said - increased media-attention . 
  i really ca n't blame people for thinking these things are held together by duct-tape . 
  [ german minister ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/20/belgium-rejects-german-call-for-nuclear-plants-closure ) :  belgium on wednesday rejected a request by neighbouring germany to shutter two ageing nuclear plants near their shared border , arguing the facilities met with the strictest safety standards . 
   german environment minister , barbara hendricks , earlier on wednesday requested that the 40-year-old tihange 2 and doel 3 reactors be turned off `` until the resolution of outstanding security issues '' . 
  i ca n't be bothered looking up luxembourg . 
   the dutch minister even said the plants were safe :   `` what the experts are telling me gives me the certainty at the moment that the ** doel ** plant is safe '' . 
  when was that quote given ? 
  the head of the belgian nuclear authority does n't seem [ particularly satisfied ] ( https://www.1limburg.nl/woede-over-lakse-houding-exploitant-tihange ) with safety measures either , i might add . 
  but sure . 
  all of this is just perception bias and the stupid plebs acting hysterical like always . 
  these plants were supposed to be decommissioned years ago and currently suffer from at least several '' [ incidents ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tihange_nuclear_power_station#incidents ) '' a year in which the plants have to close . 
  on top of that the [ ministries of the environment ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20160128-belgium-nuclear-reactors-doel-tihange-security ) of germany , the netherlands and luxembourg have asked for temporary closure of the plant as well , because the safety culture at the plants just across the border , was not particularly in order . 
  you really expect people that live a stone 's throw away from these plants to just shrug and move on with their daily lives , even when iodine pills arrive in their mailbox from the government `` just in case '' ? 
   well , they 're aware that this could very easily be used to document entry and stick greece or italy with them . 
  why would you possibly think that eastern europe gives a rat 's ass about that ? 
  they certainly did n't seem to care when we tried to take the pressure off italy and greece with the redistribution quotas . 
   had countries like yours and mine been a little less small minded and made securing the eu border a ( properly funded ) eu responsibility do n't really think the blame lies with the uk and germany here ... https://euobserver.com/migration/131513  foreign ministers in brussels on monday ( 14 december ) gave a lukewarm reception to eu commission plans for a new eu border and coast guard force . 
   but for their part , outspoken politicians from eastern europe say the commission proposal is `` undemocratic '' and `` incompatible '' with national sovereignty . 
  the wikipedia article mentions that mainly fault lies with the corps of engineers though . 
  are n't they federal ?
