  it seems the greek government is actually fine with that part though . 
   the revised proposal , seen by reuters , extends the deadline by which greece would have to completely phase out a pension supplement , called ekas , by two years to 2019 , compared with the previous position of the creditors . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/25/eurozone-greece-revisedproposal-idusl8n0zb28d20150625 then the [ wall street journal ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/06/24/5-ways-greece-and-its-creditors-are-still-at-odds/ ) writes :  the greek proposal was to phase out ekas between 2018 and 2020 . 
  so the creditors already met greece half-way on that point . 
  also i suppose since it will be phased out years from now it 's technically - sort of , not really - not cutting current pensions . 
  wonder why they 're so adamant about it though . 
  ekas is obviously designed to help out the 45 % of pensioners that are living below the poverty line , just abolishing it seems harsh . 
  is it being badly implemented ? 
  or is there some other measure in the pipeline to replace it at that time in the future ? 
  if 30 % of greeks are below the poverty line ( as per the article ) that means 70 % are above it . 
  why ca n't they have a little less , so the 30 % can have a little more ? 
  we 're all struggling with income/wealth inequality . 
  asking everybody in bulgaria - including the poor - to have less , so everybody in greece - including the not-so-poor - can have a bit more seems like an odd way to go about fixing it . 
  what magical , panacean oil deal is this now ? 
   pensions might be paid in drachma but the drachma will devalue by probably 70-80 % or more , ** the result will be the same or worse as if pensions were cut by the government in accordance with the eu agreement . 
  ** this is probably worth emphasizing . 
  according to your source wages are twice as high in greece whilst rent is only 4-35 % higher and most other costs are in the +60 % range . 
  so sure , it is cheaper in romania , but that does n't really seem to compare with the difference in wages . 
  or am i missing something ? 
   `` despite certain advances , in particular the passing of a new anti-discrimination law and measures to make judicial procedures relating to racist crime more effective , a number of problems in poland continue to give cause for concern , such as the rise of nationalist groups , racism at sports events and intolerance of lgbt persons , '' https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/library/pressreleases/191-09_06_2015_poland_en.asp full report [ here ] ( https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/country-by-country/poland/pol-cbc-v-2015-20-eng.pdf ) so yeah . 
  some progress . 
  but `` negligible minority '' ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i also wonder how much of the move towards tolerance is by choice and how much is by being dragged to it by the eu . 
  are greek taxes on tourism really that high compared to other , similar countries ? 
  apparently part of it is also yet more tax evasion . 
  http://news.gtp.gr/2015/03/31/tourism-professionals-decide-fight-illegal-accommodation-greece/  mr. andreadis said that illegal tourism accommodation is a `` huge wound '' to the industry as some 40 percent of greece 's total overnights per year are booked in such establishments . 
  i really do n't think the greeks realize quite how insane their levels of tax evasion look to the rest of the civilized world . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/report-cites-rise-in-low-wage-workers-dependent-on-welfare-benefits-a-898693.html looks pretty capitalist to me . 
  [ greece ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3a%2f%2fhighlighthollywood.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f05%2fmace_tyrell.jpg&amp;f=1 ) [ germany ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3a%2f%2fstatic2.hypable.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f05%2fmark-gatiss-game-of-thrones-tycho-nestoris-hbo1.jpg&amp;f=1 ) yeah . 
  it sort of fits . 
   least sympathetic eu country i 'm sure someone is going to make a joke about france any minute now . 
  i did n't state any opinion on the way the crisis is handled one way or the other . 
  i 'm just saying if southern europe thought that northern european voters - and by extension their politicians - would have been perfectly happy accepting even more cuts at home , so there could be genuine long-term investments in southern europe , then they were being willfully ignorant . 
  in other words : i do n't think the whole keynesian theory pour-money-into-economy-during-recession-thing was ever realistic because of electoral reasons , so i 'm not sure why it keeps getting brought up whenever the crisis is being discussed . 
   instead of favouring expansive policies who was ever going to pay for those expansive policies in southern europe though ? 
  if your answer is northern europe , then do you really believe that the party that would have been in favour of that , would n't have just been voted out of office the next time the voting booths were open ? 
  to be fair the uk has lots of other systems in place welfare-wise . 
  if you 're unemployed in the uk , you get unemployment benefits . 
  in greece , you live off your grandmother 's pension . 
  i 'm sure italy will be in for another rude awakening any day now ... 
   sorry but that is not a government source the [ official website ] ( https://www.politie.nl/ ) of the dutch police force is not a government source ? 
  https://imgur.com/caxofea http://www.politie.nl/binaries/content/assets/politie/documenten-algemeen/publicaties-archief/anti-homogeweld-in-nederland.pdf the native population that makes up ~ 81 % of the total is responsible for 36 % of homophobic violent crime . 
  moroccans that make up less than 2 % of the total population are * also * responsible for 36 % of homophobic violent crime . 
  that does n't seem a bit lopsided to you ? 
  what this shows me is that if my country had been as xenophobic and isolationist as japan , i 'd be three times less likely to get beaten up for holding another guy 's hand whilst walking the street . 
  obviously i 'm not advocating for that , but just pretending the problem is n't there is n't going to make it disappear either . 
  what am i looking at here ? 
  there 's nothing in the abstract that stands out and i ca n't access the full article . 
   since it is only a redundant guarantee to our justice system is it . . ? 
   in contrast to other areas of public international law , in international investment law an investor is hardly required to exhaust local remedies before resorting to isds ( ` local remedies rule ' ) . 
  this is due to the silence of most investment instruments on this point which was read -- in conjunction with other evidence -- by tribunals as a ` waiver ' of the local remedies rule . 
  they 've been part of trade agreements where one partner had a questionable or immature justice system . 
  between the eu and the us that obviously is n't the case . 
   * gus van harten , associate professor of law at the osgoode hall law school in toronto , has studied the investor-state dispute scheme for 15 years . 
  he has written a number of studies on the topic . 
  *  in the context of a treaty between two countries with mature and reliable courts systems , the primary historical argument for these treaties falls away , because the purpose was to use arbitration to substitute for courts systems where they were thought to be unreliable . 
  so that entire wikipedia article is just a crock of shit ? 
  and if so and everything is just hunky-dory , why is the president hell-bent on changing it ? 
   president barack obama reportedly is planning to take executive action to close the so-called `` gun show loophole '' in federal gun laws . 
   as of september 2015 , 18 states and washington d.c. have background check requirements beyond federal law . 
  that still seems to leave the majority of states . 
   gazprom pjsc , the world 's biggest natural gas producer , said full-year profit jumped almost five-fold , signaling the possibility of a higher dividend payout just as the russian government needs more funds to plug its budget gap . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/gazprom-2015-profit-jumps-as-kremlin-demands-higher-dividend guess who gazprom 's biggest customer is . 
  declaring war on europe is russia committing economic suicide . 
  with no background checks even . 
  it 's scary . 
   under federal law , private-party sellers are not required , nor are they permitted to perform background checks on buyers . 
  and kids playing with daddy 's gun . 
   monsanto actually allows over 100 universities in the us monsanto has plenty of financial ties with universities though . 
  https://www.salon.com/2012/05/14/monsantos_college_strangehold/  conducting research requires funding , and today 's research follows the golden rule : the one with the gold makes the rules . 
   all corporate agricultural research , $ 7.4 billion in 2006 , dwarfs the mere $ 5.7 billion in all public funding of agricultural research spent the same year . 
   influence does not end with research funding , however . 
  in 2005 , nearly one third of agricultural scientists reported consulting for private industry . 
   monsanto pays independent contractors to study their products , just like in every other industry . 
  i 'd rather monsanto pays more taxes and lets the government do the testing . 
  independent sadly does n't always mean what it should . 
   funding bias , also known as sponsorship bias , funding outcome bias , funding publication bias , and funding effect , refers to the tendency of a scientific study to support the interests of the study 's financial sponsor . 
   he is saying a long term goal of russia 's is the breakup of the eu . 
  and it 's the long-term goal of kim jong un to rule the world . 
  why is this relevant ? 
  are the baltics close to getting kicked out of the eu/nato ? 
  [ canada tar sands will not be labelled ` dirty ' after all ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/canada-tar-sands-will-not-be-labelled-dirty-after-all/ )  critics have long suspected the weakening of the proposal was linked to talks over the eu-canada free trade deal ceta , and its eu-us equivalent , the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) . 
  there 's plenty more stories like this . 
  it 's obvious various industries have way too much influence in writing this thing . 
  [ eu dropped pesticide laws due to us pressure over ttip , documents reveal ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/22/eu-dropped-pesticide-laws-due-to-us-pressure-over-ttip-documents-reveal ) shit like this is happening even before the thing is implemented . 
  that does n't exactly bode well for the future in my mind . 
   they did crimea and ukraine neither of which are a part of the eu , or nato . 
   but even if they are not a legit threat , much of ee sees them as one , and it would significantly strengthen solidarity if they felt we took their concerns seriously . 
  as long as ee takes huge handouts every year , but is perfectly comfortable letting greece and italy handle all the refugees they do n't get to talk solidarity . 
   besides that , every country in nato is supposed to have a functioning military i 'm all for that . 
  but i think we need to keep the military 's primary purpose in mind - keeping us safe - and not tunnel-vision on the 2 % of gdp thing . 
   do poland and the baltics have a hostile neighbor ? 
  yes . 
  is that hostile neighbour really a threat ? 
  they 're largely dependant on european gas revenues and france and italy alone already outstrip russia in military spending . 
  those two are n't indicative of what would happen if poland was attacked by russia though . 
  neither georgia nor ukraine are part of nato or the eu . 
   its about policy not geography geography definitely helps when it comes to dealing with issues surrounding refugees though . 
  when canada took in those syrian refugees a few months back , did you notice how they were all women and children ?
