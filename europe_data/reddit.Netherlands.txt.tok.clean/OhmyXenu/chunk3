  yet when you looked at the refugee stream coming into europe at the time , it was all young men . 
  that 's because canada has the luxury of picking and choosing it 's refugees thanks to the oceans . 
  i think that 's because they became citizens of other eu countries first , and then moved to the uk . 
  it kinda is for some persecuted minorities . 
   in the 18 months since archbishop wojciech polak became poland 's catholic primate , < snip  it 's also asserted its conservative brand of catholicism in ecclesiastical debates abroad , and seen the election of a new polish government committed to defending the faith at home . 
  http://ncronline.org/news/global/polands-catholic-primate-defends-conservative-vision in other words : lgbt-folk should n't expect to be counted as full-fledged citizens anytime soon . 
  it 's an odd title if this is about celebrating polish statehood , to be honest . 
  everybody obviously includes the netherlands . 
  it 's just kind of silly that some countries are pushing others to make changes , whilst making none of their own . 
  doing it like that will ultimately change nothing . 
  [ it 's easier to hide your money in the us than almost anywhere ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/06/panama-papers-us-tax-havens-delaware ) i 'm all for fixing tax-havens , but not unilaterally . 
  everybody needs to do their part . 
  actually it seems the authorities are already involved . 
  though probably not in the way you think . 
   members of the ukrainian secret service sbu played a role in trying to trade the paintings stolen from the westfries museum in 2005 http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/12/07/ukrainian-secret-service-accused-of-trading-stolen-dutch-paintings/ i 'm pretty sure this played a role in the recent referendum . 
   68 % of people did n't want a referendum about this and preferred our parliament to decide it for them the parliament already agreed to this . 
  so if people want parliament to take care of it , why would n't they just go along with them and go out and vote yes ? 
   so sure , the no-camp won the referendum , but it is clear that the `` we should n't have referenda about this bullshit '' - camp has made it clear that we should stop all this populist referendum nonsense for the indefinite future . 
  that 's nice and all . 
  but `` i do n't like referenda '' is n't an answer to the question of `` do you want this agreement or not ? '', 
  it is also not clear in the slightest . 
  i mean did people protest referenda in general or this particular one ? 
   it is a legitimate way to reach the goal . 
  a goal that failed , but now all of a sudden everyone wants to take-backsies and make sure their vote that they did n't express is counted . 
  you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  well if they wanted it to be yes , then maybe they should have gone out and voted yes . 
  that 's just the way the system works . 
  the `` strategic '' voting was idiotic . 
   the best thing about the french is they do n't . 
  good thing that does n't look set to change in the future then . 
   a global study of english language proficiency in 60 nations revealed that the ability of the french to master the language of shakespeare is actually declining . 
   the large majority said they would did not / would not vote because they either believed it was ridiculous that we were asked to vote on a matter like this or because our parliament had already voted yes . 
  so basically the large majority of people in your anecdote do n't care either way . 
  why are you counting them in the yes-camp in the hypothetical situation where they 'd actually go and vote ? 
  it 's true . 
  i feel very overprivileged when i hold my boyfriend 's hand in public and get shouted at/spit on or just plain [ beaten up ] ( https://imgur.com/s6fn3ju ) . 
  i 'd like to point out that when it becomes time to elect our european representatives , we barely get 30 % of the population to vote as well , yet no one stands up and calls the elections `` hijacked '' or irrelevant * then * . 
  maybe we should n't do so now either . 
   it seems that some countries are even gaining in religious followers . 
  in africa sure . 
  though mainly by way of increased population growth . 
  do you have any numbers on the church growing here in europe ? 
   look at eastern europe and southern europe , they 're very religious and it does not look like they 're becoming athiest anytime soon . 
  does n't seem to be the case for poland at least . 
   an official survey by the polish catholic church found that in the last 10 years the number attending sunday mass has fallen by around two million , and that on average only 39 per cent of the population now attend church : the first time the figure has been below 40 per cent since 1980 . 
   the drop was described as `` significant '' by father wojciech sadlon , director of the catholic church institute of statistics , the body that carried out the research . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/10961493/polish-catholics-in-decline.html as for the south of europe ... spain was one of the first countries in the world to implement gay marriage and at italy 's recent civil union debate the rallies for the new law seemed a lot bigger than the protests against it . 
  even if there are still plenty of people calling themselves catholic in the south , it definitely seems like the church 's actual influence on morality and politics is waning . 
  has austerity ever been tried properly in greece ? 
  they have n't implemented all reforms they agreed to implement in any of the agreements they 've signed so far . 
  even the new one . 
   the transfer of billions of euros in financial aid to greece might be delayed because athens is not implementing reforms agreed with creditors , who are putting pressure on the government . 
  http://www.msn.com/en-za/news/other/greece-must-wait-for-aid-due-to-slow-reforms/ar-bbmuhzm can you really say something has failed , if you 're just repeatedly half-assing it ? 
   as documented by anders aslund , latvia , which was also hit by a severe financial crisis in 2008-2009 , managed to overcome its negative consequences and return to rapid growth in 2011 and to fiscal surplus in 2012 . 
  this was possible due to a frontloaded large-scale fiscal adjustment and a comprehensive package of structural and institutional reforms . 
  http://bruegel.org/2015/07/five-lessons-on-greece/ this really is a bit more complicated than greece = victim , eu = evil overlord, 
  which is relevant to the average dutch voter how ... ? 
  i 'm only trying to explain why some dutch people see ukraine joining the eu even in the medium term as a bad thing . 
   if they are able to do that , then they deserve to be in the eu . 
  a lot of dutch people are tired of so much money flowing east and so simply do n't agree with this statement . 
  they 'd only be fine with ukraine joining , if it could be a net contributor . 
   over a million ukrainians in poland funny how you seem perfectly comfortable quoting statistics when they support your little narrative . 
  why is this relevant though ? 
  how many polish people live in western europe again ... ? 
   nice statistic , pity it 's from last year . 
  a statistic taken over the whole of 2015 is no longer relevant in march 2016 ? 
  okay ... 
   and we 're sucking you dry ? 
  well ...  european commission officials have moved to immediately suspend additional polish funding worth # 3 billion for road infrastructure in order `` to protect the eu budget and eu taxpayers from a case of suspected fraud '' . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/9840084/british-taxpayers-set-to-lose-100m-after-record-poland-eu-funding-scandal.html [ special report : eu funds help poland build ` ghost ' airports ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-airports-specialreport-iduskbn0js06k20141214 ) do you have any sources on polish infrastructure being built by western eu companies ? 
  why would n't they use local ones ? 
   opening up labor markets so that young people move to western eu and pay taxes there , screwing up our demographics in the long term . 
  and in the mean-time displacing our own low-skilled workers that end up on welfare . 
  but sure , poland is totally doing the rest of europe a favour in accepting billions of euro 's in cash every year . 
  poland granted refugee status to two ukrainians . 
  to be fair , that was several months ago , they may well have doubled that number by now . 
   the ukrainian ambassador to poland , andrii deshchytsia , reacted wednesday by saying that poland only granted refugee status to two ukrainian citizens last year and that the nearly 1 million ukrainians in poland are actually economic migrants . 
  that just a fucking cop-out . 
  there are definitely differing degrees of corruption between european countries and just going `` no , you ! '', 
  is an incredibly lame way of trying to deflect that . 
  how culturally insensitive of us . 
  surely we welcome the pashtuns with [ young boys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bacha_bazi ) rather than women ? 
  quite . 
  it 's bizarre how here in the netherlands growing the stuff is still illegal . 
  so you have perfectly legal [ coffeeshops ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coffeeshop_%28netherlands%29 ) being forced to buy their product from criminals through the backdoor . 
  it 's silly . 
  how closed are all the [ other routes ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/trends-and-routes/migratory-routes-map/ ) ? 
  what ? 
  gay people have been raising children a lot longer , than they 've been able to get married obviously . 
  is 30 years long enough ? 
   extensive data available from more than 30 years of research reveal that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience with regard to social , psychological , and sexual health de - spite economic and legal disparities and social stigma . 
   there is no empirical support for the notion that the presence of both male and female role models in the home promotes adjustment among children or adolescents . 
  considering they 're largely propped up by cash from the north ... 
  probably not so good !, 
   saying that all slavic countries have one and the same culture is very ignorant to say . 
  of course this is ignorant to say . 
  which is why i never said it . 
   yes , eastern europeans tend to be more conservative , attach great importance to family values and traditions , and are more social in contrast to west europeans who tend to be einzelg\u00e4ngers . 
  maybe this has something to do with the lgbt thing . 
  so you do in fact agree with me that the shared cultural values in eastern europe ( in which predominantly slavic peoples live ) has something to do with the lgbt thing .
