  i think you 're focusing too much on the macho and not enough on the slavic part of that equation . 
  it 's also pretty naive to think this is n't in any way related to slavic macho culture . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:slaviceurope.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_europe#/media/file:same_sex_marriage_map_europe_detailed.svg that near-complete overlap of slavic culture and constitutional limits on same-sex marriage is n't coincidence . 
  / u/fruitsforhire had an interesting [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/41x572/number_of_russians_with_hiv_hits_1_million/cz68o8l ) about that over on the worldnews thread . 
  i think it 's compensated for by some of greece 's competitors around the mediterranean suddenly turning into shitholes and better prices .

  i like how you had to dig through 350 years of history before finally finding an example . 
  `` studies '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_family_structures_study#criticism one review of his `` work '' :  musick sympathetically summarized many of the prior criticisms , going on to allege that ** the survey itself was designed to ensure the conflation of family structure and the parents ' same-sex orientation , practically guaranteeing negative results . 
  ** musick claimed that non-disclosure of this design flaw in the original article ( in fact regnerus claimed the opposite , that the observed instability was due to social realities , not study design ) possibly violated university research ethics standards . 
  so no . 
  the verdict is most definitely not still out on this one . 
   the political elite do but even here in sweden 56 % of the population is against homosexual adoption which i gather was the main wedge issue of this vote . 
  https://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=6151  `` same-sex couples should have the same rights to adopt children as heterosexual couples do . '' those most likely to agree with the statement hail from sweden ( 78 % ) from 2013 and a small sample size though . 
  where are you getting your numbers from ? 
   over time it may change . 
  which is exactly what i 'm saying . 
  it 's two steps forward , one step back in a lot of places , but lgbt + rights are advancing everywhere . 
  i doubt poland will be different , which is what he seems to think . 
  doubt it 'll be long now . 
  why do n't you just move to russia if it bothers you that much ? 
  they seem to share a lot of values with the conservative parts of poland . 
   i believe that if you force gay rights too soon ( like slovenia as far as i can tell ) you will get some backlash as today . 
  i disagree actually . 
  i think if you pushed the law through and people realized that it was n't instantly going to rain fire and people were n't marrying donkeys all over the place , they 'd just forget their outrage altogether and just go back to the day-to-day . 
  a lot of the reasoning for no-voters seems to revolve around ignorance . 
  some time spent actually living in a country with same-sex marriage would have dispelled a lot of that , i think .

  of course the horrible cynic in me says you 'll now point out the american academy of pediatrics are just a bunch of hacks pushing the gay agenda \u2122 . 
  edit : / u/alogicalpenguin 's [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xm2r5/preliminary_results_slovenians_reject_samesex/cy5vndd ) below also has some interesting links . 
   but all it takes is one child growing up with same-sex parents feeling deprived of something and all the research done becomes worthless . 
  so just because a child * might * feel deprived at a later date it should n't happen ? 
  what if a child does n't want to be raised by a couple of a certain socio-economic class because it does n't want to be deprived of being given a new maserati for each of it 's birthdays ? 
  should people who ca n't afford a new maserati every year not be allowed to adopt ? 
  after all , a child might well feel deprived !, 
  the line you 're drawing at same-sex parents is ridiculously arbitrary . 
  obviously a child 's needs should come first , but this is a bit silly . 
  a lamb and three wolves vote on what 's for dinner ... 
   the eu screwed this country so some bankers and hedge fund guys can have another private jet . 
  were n't there plenty of social programmes funded by the money the greek government borrowed ? 
  i think there are a few crucial differences between the immigrant groups in both area 's that make comparing them like this meaningless . 
   the church ruled and protestants were a minority , and that has not changed . 
  is the church in ireland really just as strong as it always was ? 
   while we have resources and solutions for both of those problems ( not for the heroine , tho , iv used drugs are still huge ) are there no needle exchange programmes in russia ? 
  guessing english is n't his first language . 
  i did n't know the word homo was offensive either . 
   and i 'd be glad if somebody told me whether there are researches on same-sex parenting in case you 're genuinely interested :  there is no empirical support for the notion that the presence of both male and female role models in the home promotes adjustment among children or adolescents .

  marriage was a secular tradition before a religious one . 
  the catholic church - or any other religion - is not the sole arbiter of what can or can not constitute a marriage . 
  especially when it 's the state that attaches all sorts of rights to a marriage . 
   we could avoid pissing everyone off by just giving it another name but with the same benefits . 
  i quite agree . 
  lets just call the secular state-registered marriage a `` marriage '' and then catholics can call their marriages a `` catholic marriage '' or whatever they want really . 
  i mean it 's just a different name , right ? 
  i think with `` corporate situation '' he just means it 's a situation that 's been playing out in the corporate world a lot the last few years . 
  he is n't placing blame . 
  wonder how they come to that conclusion . 
  i 'll just be lazy and link to / u/oldenbarnevelt 's comment in another thread about this , as it explains why this seems unlikely to me . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3rmclx/european_economic_forecast_autumn_2015/cwpbuay  employment is usually the single most important determinant of a migrant 's net fiscal contribution . 
  in that case , past refugees could tell us something . 
  the cbs made some statistics for this ; 68 % of former somalian refugees are unemployed . 
  58 % of former iraqi refugees are unemployed 62 % of former syrian refugees are unemployed 50 % of former eritrean refugees are unemployed 45 % of former afghani refugees are unemployed, 
   when it comes to altering doctrine , i think it 's largely irrelevant , however . 
  you may well have a point there . 
  i 've googled a bit for reasons for leaving the catholic church though and a lot of people at the very least mention the church 's conservative views as a contributing factor . 
  but if they really would have stayed if the church went all hippie jesus ? 
  who knows . 
   nice one mate , i 'm sure that adequately represents catholics worldwide , especially since at one point calvinism was essentially a state religion . 
  funnily enough the protestant church here is doing even worse . 
  it 's pretty obvious that religion in general is in decline in [ north america ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx ) and [ europe ] ( http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/10/statistics-round-up--religion-in-decline-around-europe-and-usa ) . 
  also [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religious_disaffiliation_in_germany#statistics_on_leaving_the_church_.28church_exit.29 ) . 
  and even in [ south america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_atheism#south_america ) . 
   irreligion in south america had increased for a period of 30 straight years , and it had a growing status in all countries in the first decade of the 21st century . 
  [ numbers on the catholic church in south america ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2014/11/13/religion-in-latin-america/ ) in particular are even worse , with many people leaving for evangelical / pentecostal churches . 
  only places catholicism is growing is africa ( birth rates through the roof help ) , south korea ( though atheism is growing there too ) and china . 
  keep believing despite all evidence to the contrary though , i 'm sure you must be pretty good at that by now . 
  `` the church is strong and not at all dying ! '', 
  - organization the members of which have an average age of ~ 70 and are forced to shut down 93 % of churches in some areas . 
  it was the only country that i could find a nice quotable number on . 
  why would you think marriage in other countries confers fewer rights ? 
   aside from tax stuff depending on the country . 
  yeah , just some tax stuff .
