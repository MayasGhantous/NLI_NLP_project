  nothing all that important . 
   there are ** 1,138 benefits , rights and protections ** provided on the basis of marital status in federal law . 
  http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/an-overview-of-federal-rights-and-protections-granted-to-married-couples  when a loved one is in the hospital , you naturally want to be at the bedside . 
  but what if the staff wo n't allow it ? 
   that 's what janice langbehn , a social worker in lacey , wash. , says she experienced when her partner of 18 years , lisa pond , collapsed with an aneurysm during a florida vacation and was taken to a miami trauma center . 
  she died there , at age 39 , as ms. langbehn tried in vain to persuade hospital officials to let her visit , along with the couple 's adopted children . 
  gay parents do just fine according to 30 years of study by pediatricians . 
   extensive data available from more than 30 years of research reveal that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience with regard to social , psychological , and sexual health despite economic and legal disparities and social stigma . 
   separate but equal the majority of civil unions do n't come with the same rights as marriage , so it 's not even equal . 
   from the early christian era ( 30 to 325 ce ) , marriage was thought of as primarily a private matter , with no uniform religious or other ceremony being required . 
  yup . 
   there are ** 1,138 benefits , rights and protections ** provided on the basis of marital status in federal law . 
  http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/an-overview-of-federal-rights-and-protections-granted-to-married-couples that 's in the us , sure . 
  but doubt it 's much different here in europe . 
  and no . 
  registered life partnerships do * not * bestow all the same rights . 
   but where did glorious agnostic western culture get the word and concept of marriage from ? 
  probably from organized religion . 
  what makes you say that ? 
  marriage was a thing before christianity was around and even when it * was * around the two were n't immediately inextricably linked . 
   from the early christian era ( 30 to 325 ce ) , marriage was thought of as primarily a private matter , with no uniform religious or other ceremony being required .

  http://europa.eu/epic/practices-that-work/evidence-based-practices/practices/kiva_en.htm not everything that touches anything corporate ever is immediately evil incarnate \u2122 . 
  that 's just a defeatist attitude . 
  also wrong . 
   a key measure of the program 's success is that 98 % of the students whose bullying incidents were tackled by the school 's kiva \u2122 team said their situations improved . 
  you 're still not making an iota of sense . 
  so how about this : if an opinion is n't rooted in observable fact , perhaps that opinion needs to be re-examined . 
  furthermore , that opinion should most definitely not be used as grounds to negatively impact other people . 
   i said that this could a a huge reason for bullying and that children should not suffer because of it . 
  bullying ? 
  seriously ? 
  the list of people who then should n't be parents because of potential bullying is rather long . 
  disabled , different race , funny nose . 
  should all these people be disallowed to adopt ? 
   also i said that i believe for biological and evolutionary reasons that the best possible way is father and mother . 
  biological reasons ? 
  evolutionary reasons ? 
  ( the latter of which is silly enough to begin with as there 's plenty of working theories of why homosexuality exists . 
  [ kin selection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kin_selection ) , just to name one . ), 
  you 're going to have to elaborate on why you think evolution or biology are particularly relevant when it comes to raising a child . 
  http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/18/peds.2013-0377  extensive data available from more than 30 years of research reveal that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience with regard to social , psychological , and sexual health despite economic and legal disparities and social stigma . 
  and i would assume the finances stuff is baked into the regular adoption process . 
  you still have not shown one lick of proof that gay parents by definition can not be `` the best possible solution available '' . 
  and if you 're going googling for studies showing gay people make horrible parents , please make sure they are n't written by mark regnerus as his stuff has been rather thoroughly debunked . 
   i still believe that these children should get the best they can get and ** that includes a father and a mother ** . 
  first of all : why do you believe that ? 
  second of all : i assume you 're also campaigning against single parenthood then ? 
  you 're drawing some very arbitrarily placed lines in the sand here . 
   claims that isds panels will be `` by corporate lawyers for companies '' fall down on the simple arithmetic there . 
  a law firm that always finds for companies is never going to be picked by a government , and the government will reject it for the third arbitrator as well . 
  and the same the other way round . 
  so how do you explain the us not losing a single isds case under nafta whilst mexico and canada both had around the same percentage of losses ? 
  there are currently no failsafes to protect against conflict of interest . 
  the system is open to abuse . 
   the market value of yukos ' assets . 
  i would have thought that was pretty obvious . 
  did you read what i quoted ? 
  here it is again :  what is most astonishing is that the arbitral tribunal has not provided any standard or credible rationale behind awarding $ 50 bn in compensation to claimants . 
  the calculations of total damages put forward by claimants are based on assumptions and hard evidence is lacking . 
   the tribunal found that the claimants contributed to 25 per cent `` to the prejudice they suffered at the hands of the russian federation . '' hence , the amount of damages to be paid by russia is reduced by 25 per cent to $ 50 bn from $ 67 bn . 
  in its lengthy 615-page verdict , no explanation has been given by the tribunal on how did it arrive at 25 per cent of claimants ' contributory fault ? 
  why not 30 or 40 or 50 per cent ? 
  so here you have a system of corporate lawyers that have 1 ) no checks against conflict of interest , making a decision that has 2 ) no maximum of the amount of damages that can be awarded , and are comfortable with 3 ) just copy pasting whatever numbers on projected future profits investors give them , and then 4 ) add their own modifiers to that sum , for which they supply no justification whatsoever . 
  yeah , you 'll forgive me if that does n't exactly inspire confidence . 
  you 're absolutely correct that that is good for investors . 
  would you mind explaining why this is good for the population of a country though ? 
  i 'm going to make an ass out of myself and assume you 're going to say that the increased protection is going to hugely increase investment flows which will totally make everyone super rich . 
  okay . 
  got any numbers on that ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_inequality  economic inequality , also known as ** income inequality ** , ** wealth inequality ** , gap between rich and poor , gulf between rich and poor and contrast between rich and poor , refers to how economic metrics are distributed among individuals in a group , among groups in a population , or among countries . 
   we invented capitalism and have the second most isds trade agreements with other countries after the us . 
  lots of isds case wins against developing countries too ... [ kind of how i feel right now . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1vxamejru ), 
   who are you quoting here ? 
  gus van harten , associate professor of law at the osgoode hall law school in toronto , has studied the investor-state dispute scheme for 15 years . 
  he has written a number of studies on the topic . 
   the courts are unreliable . 
  oh yes . 
  you have totally changed my mind with that sweeping statement , that you have not backed up in any way , shape or form . 
  ja , citation needed . 
   1 ) you seem to have not checked the links in the preceding comments in this discussion . 
  they will use qualified judges . 
  not lawyers . 
  they will be appointed by the eu & the country in question & there 's no picking & choosing . 
  that 's just isds with a paintjob , it 's still a private court outside the legal system for corporations . 
  what is this ? 
  marketing 101 ? 
  make small , meaningless changes , rebrand and hope no one notices ? 
  another question then ( long quote from the same [ article ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/trade-society/analyst-isds-model-australia-not-canada-310835 ) i linked earlier , sorry ) :  are there any treaties that are working well without isds that you can use as an example ? 
   the most common example is between the us and australia that was concluded about 10-12 years ago , where australia refused to include investor state arbitration , the us agreed , and australia was able to achieve that in negotiations . 
   they only have a judicial system . 
  what happens if something goes wrong ? 
   if there is a dispute under the treaty , there is a state to state dispute resolution , like in the wto . 
  investors also have protection in the domestic courts , and there is another alternative , which are contracts . 
   any big investment project has a contract associated with it , and those big contracts have their own dispute settlement clauses that can provide for all of the same arbitration mechanism on a contract by contract basis . 
  why ca n't we have something like this ? 
  why does it have to be isds or gtfo ? 
   the county with the smallest wealth inequality is apparently china , because there is a culture of saving a large portion of one 's income , even among the poor . 
  guess i 'm reading these numbers wrong : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality,
