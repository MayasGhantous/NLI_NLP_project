  of course then you get cancer and you 're deemed `` too expensive '' and the company just cuts you off , because in america they can . 
   the aetna student health insurance plan provided by asu caps the lifetime insurance benefit paid out at $ 300,000 , which the high cost of treatment used up in less than one year . 
  http://poopstrong.org/ it 's just fucking bizarro world over there in some respects . 
  worst part is most of you do n't even seem to realise it . 
   what end of the stick we 'll end up at some information on that : https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national%20office/2015/01/nafta_chapter11_investor_state_disputes_2015.pdf mexico and canada lose isds cases plenty of times under nafta , but the us ... ? 
  they apparently have the bestestest lawyers in the world , because they have n't lost a single one . 
  i 'm sure that 's totally just coincidence though . 
  ` murica !, 
   a free trade deal with the us . 
  free trade deals do n't * have * to come with isds and whatever other nonsense though . 
   isds clauses are a standard part of any trade agreement . 
  ** mostly ** because one party 's justice system is deemed to be lacking though . 
  which ca n't exactly be said for the us nor the eu . 
   the only thing isds clauses change is that they establish a neutral entity . 
  that 's what it sets out to do , sure . 
  i just think it fails miserably . 
  the arbitrators are just corporate lawyers not trained as judges at all . 
  they can also still work in the field , which means they may well end up arbritrating a case in which one of their clients is involved ( conflict of interest apparently is n't a thing ) . 
  then there 's stuff like [ this ] ( http://www.shearman.com/en/services/practices/international-arbitration/yukos-arbitral-award ) . 
  what exactly did they base the number of 50 billion on ? 
  it seems to be nothing other than the magical crystal ball of the investors . 
   what is most astonishing is that the arbitral tribunal has not provided any standard or credible rationale behind awarding $ 50 bn in compensation to claimants . 
  the calculations of total damages put forward by claimants are based on assumptions and hard evidence is lacking . 
  the tribunal found that the claimants contributed to 25 per cent `` to the prejudice they suffered at the hands of the russian federation . '' hence , the amount of damages to be paid by russia is reduced by 25 per cent to $ 50 bn from $ 67 bn . 
  in its lengthy 615-page verdict , no explanation has been given by the tribunal on how did it arrive at 25 per cent of claimants ' contributory fault ? 
  why not 30 or 40 or 50 per cent ? 
  http://www.madhyam.org.in/the-era-of-mega-arbitration-tribunal-awards-50-billion-against-russia-in-yukos-case/ you also fail to explain the following : why do we * need * isds ? 
  you yourself admitted investors can already sue countries . 
  and the courtsystems in both the us and the eu work just fine . 
  why ca n't investors use those same courtrooms they 've been using for the past decades that there have been huge trans-atlantic investment flows ? 
   let 's focus on the purpose of resolving disputes , involving foreign investors . 
  the primary alternative is to use existing courts , which in europe would include the domestic courts of member states , subject to review in european courts . 
  in the us , it would use american courts subject to the supreme court . 
   in the context of a treaty between two countries with mature and reliable courts systems , the primary historical argument for these treaties falls away , because the purpose was to use arbitration to substitute for courts systems where they were thought to be unreliable . 
  the court systems are not unreliable in either the us , nor in the eu . 
  so we do n't * need * the isds mechanism . 
  as to why investors might * want * it :  as you probably know , arbitrators can work also as lawyers in the field . 
  this is totally inappropriate , because if a judge represents a paying client on one side , and the same legal issues arise in different cases , one could reasonably suspect that the judge interprets the law in a way that favours paying clients . 
  it 's harder to push that these days though . 
  some people are basically forced to make pornographic video 's of themselves just so they can finally `` prove '' they 're non-straight . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/03/gay-asylum-seekers-pressure-prove-sexuality pretty sad . 
      source , page 9     the funny part is that your very own source says the same . 
  you do not have to look at page 32 but at page 33 ( because 32 shows a running total ) . 
  the number of cases between 2010 and 2014 has been lower than ever before . 
  epic fail on my part . 
   that 's just one example . 
  hardly evidence of bias on a large scale . 
    its evidence that discrimination can happen in developed judicial systems . 
  so your assertion is that investors really want isds because they need protection from governments of a different nationality that otherwise are biased against them ? 
  that this is n't the sole reason why investors want isds is pretty easily shown by lone pine resources canada ltd. vs. canada . 
  lone pine is pretty much a canadian company , it was started there , it has it 's headquarters there , most of it 's economic activity is in canada . 
  hell , it even has canada in the name . 
  but it also has a small office in bumfuck idaho . 
  and when quebec said `` no '' to fracking , lone star decided it was n't canadian at all , but a us company instead and used the isds clause in nafta to sue the canadian government . 
  so why did n't this local company just go through the local courts to sue their local government ? 
  could it be because local courts staffed with actual judges are n't as easy to manipulate as three corporate lawyers ( please stop calling them judges ) ? 
  as for the increase in awards . 
  [ yeah ... ] ( http://www.shearman.com/en/services/practices/international-arbitration/yukos-arbitral-award )  what is most astonishing is that the arbitral tribunal has not provided any standard or credible rationale behind awarding $ 50 bn in compensation to claimants . 
  the calculations of total damages put forward by claimants are based on assumptions and hard evidence is lacking . 
  http://www.madhyam.org.in/the-era-of-mega-arbitration-tribunal-awards-50-billion-against-russia-in-yukos-case/ do n't get me wrong , russia is obviously an asshole for nationalizing assets , but i 'm also pretty sure that if i went to an actual court and submitted a report from my local astrologer as to my projected profits it would get thrown out instantly . 
  not so in arbitration though . 
  yeah i can see why investors want this . 
  the simple truth is that we 're giving away sovereignty just so that lawyers are very , very happy and just so that investors are a tiny bit happier . 
  people really inflate the importance of this thing to investors . 
  ask any investor and they 'll tell you that market size , growth and political stability are the most important factors to decide where to invest . 
  and the numbers definitely bear that out . 
  despite europe by and large having no isds agreements with the us , transatlantic fdi flows are huge . 
  conversely there is comparatively little investment in africa where there are a lot of isds agreements on the books . 
   i think you are mistaken . 
  loewen v. us for example proved that these ` well-developed justice systems ' still discriminate foreign investments sometimes . 
  this is especially true for jury systems , but regular judges also have a tendency to be biased towards their own state . 
  that 's just one example . 
  hardly evidence of bias on a large scale . 
   we have below 100 isds cases in a year . 
  it is hardly a tool to circumvent national justice systems on a large scale . 
  because what 's happening now is a guarantee of what will happen in the future ? 
  https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national%20office/2015/01/nafta_chapter11_investor_state_disputes_2015.pdf page 32 . 
  the number of claims increase year by year . 
  the awards increase in size year by year . 
  why would n't this trend happen here as well ? 
   most of the judges have better a reputation than regular national judges . 
  any source for this claim ? 
   one particularly controversial law is the ` investor state dispute settlement ' that would make it possible for corporations to sue governments for action that would hurt their future profits . 
       it ` wouldnt ' , it already does . 
  the possibilities to sue for ` future profits ' are overdramatized and just a minority of cases . 
  the isds thing is entirely unnecessary between two parties with well-developed justice systems and is in fact used to circumvent the justice systems in question in favor of `` arbitration '' . 
  here 's a fun quote about such arbitration from someone who has studied the isds mechanism for 15-years :  as you probably know , arbitrators can work also as lawyers in the field . 
  this is totally inappropriate , because if a judge represents a paying client on one side , and the same legal issues arise in different cases , one could reasonably suspect that the judge interprets the law in a way that favours paying clients . 
  yeah , i can definitely see why companies would rather deal with that , rather than the actual court system . 
  nope , nothing to worry about with regards to isds . 
  http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/239560-eyes-wide-shut-on-isds https://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/nafta-chapter-11-investor-state-disputes-january-1-2015 please note how the us has never lost a case . 
   while the country is certainly not perfect , canada 's reputation for tolerance is well earned . 
  perhaps you 're not looking hard enough . 
   in canada , the indian ( aboriginal ) [ residential schools ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian_indian_residential_school_system ) were a network of `` residential '' ( boarding ) schools for indigenous people ( first nations or `` indians '' ; m\u00e9tis and inuit ) . 
  the network was funded by the canadian government 's department of indian affairs and northern development , and administered by christian churches . 
   the policy was to remove children from the influence of their families and culture , and assimilate them into the dominant canadian culture . 
  over the course of the system 's existence , about 30 % of native children , or roughly 150,000 , were placed in residential schools nationally ; at least 6,000 of these students died while in attendance . 
  brussels -- the dutch prime minister will press european union leaders thursday to declare that an accord with ukraine does n't set kiev on a pathway to membership , according to european officials , raising fresh doubts about a key symbol of support for the country 's pro-western government . 
  mark rutte 's push , one of several options he is expected to float at an eu summit in brussels , is part of his effort to persuade domestic voters he is responding to their concerns about the ukraine deal , which dutch voters rejected in an april referendum . 
  that vote , which only narrowly topped the threshold for turnout , was widely seen as expressing growing dutch concerns about the eu -- part of a backlash across the continent against the bloc .
