  mr. rutte faces elections in the spring . 
  among his principle rivals is geert wilders , whose anti-immigration party for freedom favors leaving the eu . 
  the demands risk undermining the pact , which has offered kiev a key economic lifeline . 
  a rejection would set a `` dangerous precedent '' as ukraine is in a state of war and facing extreme pressure from russia , ukraine president petro poroshenko told reporters after a meeting in maastricht with members of the center-right european peoples ' party . 
  but on his way into the brussels summit , mr. rutte repeated he is pessimistic that a deal can be reached and that the netherlands may be unable to go ahead . 
  `` i 'm not optimistic about it ... time is running out , '' he said . 
  the eu 's association agreement with ukraine was signed in 2014 . 
  the core of the deal , a sweeping trade pact which mutually lowers tariffs , was completed at the start of 2016 when it entered into provisional force . 
  the agreement , which has helped drive a modest boost in ukraine 's exports to the eu , has been ratified in kiev , brussels and all member states except the netherlands . 
  according to dutch and european officials , mr. rutte will tell eu leaders he is exploring a couple of options . 
  one is a military opt-out for the netherlands of the eu deal , which covers trade , political and military ties , though it 's not clear what that would look like . 
  he will also press for a declaration by eu leaders that will state , among other things , that the agreement does n't pave the way for ukraine 's eu membership or necessitate further financial assistance . 
  handing the dutch an opt-out from the deal could set an awkward eu precedent where other countries demand to sit on the sidelines of certain aspects of a trade or political deal . 
  mr. rutte will struggle to persuade leaders from countries who have been most supportive of ukraine to agree to language that complicates the path toward the eu . 
  for now , the eu-ukraine pact will remain in force provisionally . 
  that is likely to remain so as long as dutch authorities are trying to ratify the pact . 
  however eu officials say that if mr. rutte and dutch lawmakers declare they wo n't sign off , the eu may not be able to continue applying the agreement provisionally . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/30/ttip-trade-deal-agreements-ceta-eu-canada  when the eu proposed prohibitive new regulations to effectively stop tar sands flowing into europe , canada used ceta as a bargaining chip to block the proposal . 
  just negotiating these things seems to have an obvious detrimental effect . 
  this was the first time she explicitly said she was willing to sacrifice single-market access in order to have immigration control . 
  i think a lot of people still hoped for a soft brexit . 
  may 's statement has made them face up to the truth , that that is simply very unlikely . 
   many ( most ? ), 
  major financial institutions predicted that a no vote would be a disaster for the uk economy . 
  it would plunge the uk into a recession it would n't recover from for years . 
  that prediction was made under the assumption that article 50 would be triggered the next day , as cameron said he would do . 
  you should be able to bypass the paywall by googling the url . 
  yeah , good luck with that . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/world/europe/english-proficiency-falters-among-french.html?_r=0  the study , by education first , an international education company , found that while english proficiency among european adults is generally increasing , proficiency in france is both low and declining . 
   a two-speed europe should have been implemented years ago . 
  it was touted as a solution to the debt crisis some years back , but a certain country vetoed it . 
  can you guess which ? 
  you 're wrong . 
   you may be confusing infertility with impotence . 
  ** infertility ( the inability to procreate children ) is not an impediment to marriage ** ; permanent and irreversible impotence ( the inability to consummate a marriage through marital relations ) is an impediment . 
  impotence that is known at the time of the marriage to be permanent and irreversible is a barrier to marriage , because the couple must be capable of consummating their marriage . 
  if the couple has reason to assume that the impotence can be treated or reversed , they may get married . 
  here 's a direct quote from him on an argentinian bill to allow gay marriage :  let 's not be na\u00efve , we 're not talking about a simple political battle ; it is a destructive pretension against the plan of god . 
  we are not talking about a mere bill , but rather a machination of the father of lies that seeks to confuse and deceive the children of god . 
  it 's all just pr .

   greece has once again fallen significantly behind in its economic reform programs . 
   the government in athens has n't come close to meeting the conditions agreed upon for the package . 
  out of a total of 15 policy measures , called `` milestones '' in e.u. 
  jargon , apparently only two have been implemented so far . 
  obviously the eu is the villain here though for expecting greece to hold up its end of the bargain . 
   i am not supporting a law that allows or requires strip searching people for hidden symbols . 
  you can wear religious symbols under your clothes just fine , i 'm quite sure . 
  why would people need to be strip-searched ? 
  but this one does n't feature a cute swedish blonde girl !, 
   and lets not start with spain who would hate a independent scotland for its own reasons . 
  not this again . 
  spain has no issues with scottish independence provided it 's not done unilaterally . 
  here 's a quote from a spanish foreign minister :  `` no one would object to a consented independence of scotland . '', 
  http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/304495/spain-will-not-veto-an-independent-scotland-joining-eu  there is a lot scepticism inside of the eu towards a independent scotland as member , some fear it might end up like greece i assume you have a source for this ? 
  what changes did he make ? 
  church doctrine on gay marriage is the exact same . 
  words are just air . 
   he has moved the church in a more progressive way towards , if not accepting , then at least coming to terms with gay marriage . 
  err ... what ? 
  how has he done this exactly ? 
  you 're reading an awful lot into his one , single `` who am i to judge ? '', 
  statement . 
  let me give you a quote from our holy father on a bill to allow gay marriage :  let 's not be na\u00efve , we 're not talking about a simple political battle ; it is a destructive pretension against the plan of god . 
  we are not talking about a mere bill , but rather a machination of the father of lies that seeks to confuse and deceive the children of god . 
  that does n't sound much like someone coming to terms with gay marriage . 
  the fbi has found no evidence of that so far . 
  [ fbi investigators say they have found no evidence that orlando shooter had gay lovers ] ( http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-orlando-gay-fbi-20160623-snap-story.html ), 
  considering this got removed due to it not being a credible source , how credible is that newspaper you linked ? 
   the uk has not strayed from it 's ( quickly improvised ) timetable yet . 
  yes , it has . 
  the last timetable was '' [ straight away ] ( http://openeurope.org.uk/daily-shakeup/cameron-government-would-promptly-trigger-article-50-in-the-event-of-a-leave-vote/ ) '' , remember ? 
   `` if the british people vote to leave , there is only one way to bring that about , namely to trigger article 50 of the treaties and begin the process of exit , and the british people would rightly expect that to start straight away . '', 
  70 % of the somali refugees that came to the netherlands in the mid-90 's are on [ welfare ] ( https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/31/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand ) . 
  one of the main reasons they ca n't find a job is , according to themselves , their lack of dutch language skills . 
  the government provides language lessons free of charge to refugees , but i guess dutch is just too hard a language to learn when living in a dutch-speaking country for 20 years . 
  i 'm sure it 's gon na be wholly different this time , though . 
  do n't you also have a lot of ageing brits over there ? 
  bit of a questionable source , no ? 
  they 're basically climate change deniers . 
  not to mention that the article seems to be from 2011 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_enterprise_institute#global_warming, 
  from the la times :  but the fbi has found ** no evidence so far to support claims by those who say mateen had gay lovers or communicated on gay dating apps ** , several law enforcement officials said . 
   on tuesday , univision aired a report in which `` miguel , '' a man wearing a disguise to conceal his identity , alleged he had sex with mateen after meeting him on the gay dating app , grindr . 
  he said mateen had sex with other men too , including a threesome with a puerto rican who allegedly told mateen , after having had unprotected sex with him , that he was hiv positive . 
   but ** investigators do not consider the man 's account credible ** , according to one senior law enforcement official with access to the investigation . 
   the fbi is continuing to explore mateen 's past , but ** investigators now believe the men who made the claims are not credible , or confused mateen with someone else ** . 
  http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-orlando-gay-fbi-20160623-snap-story.html i 'm sure it 's just some sort of lizard-people conspiracy though . 
  the fbi watched that video too and apparently did n't think it was powerful evidence . 
  or maybe that ridiculous , monthly trip to strasbourg . 
  should n't russia spend more on defence by default anyway ? 
  i mean it is defending a landmass the size of pluto , for god 's sake . 
  from just a week ago :  cosco greece objected on wednesday to terms submitted to parliament for the sale of piraeus port to china cosco shipping , saying they were inconsistent with those previously agreed with the greek privatisation agency . 
   `` the content of the specific plan is a complete reverse of what was agreed between cosco hk and taiped ( hradf ) , '' an email sent by cosco greece said , referring to the country 's privatisation agency . 
  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cosco-greece-says-piraeus-port-185930118.html that does n't sound very reliable . 
  is france meeting the budget targets ? 
  it seemed to be the danish way in 2008 . 
   but in recent years , because of the crisis , direct payments have in some cases accounted for 60 % of agricultural incomes ; this was the case , for example , in sweden , ireland and denmark during the 2008/09 crisis .

  you off-handedly dismiss the research i link , whilst failing to address the fact that the research you link is not even about isds .
