  so again : show me research that unambiguously shows substantial gains from implementing an isds mechanism . 
  having spent a few minutes googling , i literally can not find any . 
  the closest i can come is this quote from an [ ecipe paper ] ( http://www.ecipe.org/app/uploads/2014/12/occ52014__1.pdf ) :  economic research gives support to the argument that investment-protection agreements help to promote fdi . 
  which is immediately followed by :  the effect is unlikely to be strong because there are far more important determinants of fdi , such as investment market access . 
  which is the exact same thing i said earlier : isds is not a huge deciding factor for investors . 
  the pro-isds side needs to be better in communicating the benefits . 
  the problem with that is that the benefits seem to be either small , uncertain or non-existent . 
   distinguishing by region , we find that ratified bits increase fdi stocks mainly in east asia and middle & eastern europe . 
  so basically places with an iffy justice-system . 
  the exact thing isds was designed for . 
  that makes sense . 
  this is a quote from some [ wto paper ] ( https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/ersd201010_e.pdf ) :  we focus on ** investor-state dispute settlement provisions contained in various , though far from all , bilateral investment treaties ** as a possible determinant of bit-related effects on bilateral fdi flows . 
   stricter dispute settlement provisions do not necessarily result in higher fdi inflows so that the effectiveness of bits as a credible commitment device remains elusive . 
  is it just me , or does this mean that an isds mechanism * can be * part of a bit , but it does n't necessarily have to be ? 
  here 's a quote from another [ paper ] ( http://ccsi.columbia.edu/files/2016/04/160428-ttip-stakeholder-session-the-investment-chapter-unresolved-concerns-final.pdf ) :  as i will discuss , an analysis of the isds mechanism demonstrates that the costs far outweigh the benefits , and that implementing an investment court to replace ad hoc arbitration will not solve all of these problems . 
   first , there is no strong evidence that investment treaties , let alone isds , increase investment flows . 
  in other words , inclusion of isds in the ttip will likely have no effect on the investment objectives of this treaty . 
  the supposed benefits still seem iffy to me , at best . 
   just because the investments already have a giant volume does not mean that they can not be larger . 
  show me . 
  show me a country that has implemented isds with another and suddenly investment has shot up in comparison with another country that refused to implement isds . 
  all we get are vague promises . 
  way i see it people always use three arguments to argue for isds . 
  all three seem pretty weak to me . 
   isds is totally harmless and could n't possibly be used against the eu . 
  yet many countries that have an isds agreement are now desperately trying to get out from under them . 
  [ south africa ] ( https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131107/09591825170/south-africa-leads-moves-to-terminate-renegotiate-bilateral-investment-treaties.shtml ) for instance has unilaterally decided not to automatically renew agreements with isds in them . 
  this argument was also one used by canada when they signed nafta , which included an isds mechanism . 
  canada envisioned it as protection for their investors in mexico . 
  that did n't work out quite as [ planned ] ( https://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/nafta-chapter-11-investor-state-disputes-january-1-2015 ) . 
  of course the us has never lost a single nafta case . 
  i 'm sure some expert is going to sweep in and say there 's a perfectly reasonable explanation for that , but as a layman that looks fishy as fuck . 
   isds has been used in tons of trade agreements for decades !, 
  it 's a totally accepted and ubiquitous practice . 
  yeah ... no . 
  what is conveniently left out here , is that those treaties by and large involved at least one party that was seen to have a questionable justice system . 
  in fact , that 's actually why europe invented this isds thing . 
  to protect private holdings in former colonies . 
   isds is very , very important to investors . 
  without it fdi flows will surely wither and die !, 
  i just spent a couple minutes googling on what the primary factors are in deciding in which country to invest . 
  isds is n't even a blip on the radar . 
  there currently is also no isds agreement between europe and the us . 
  and yet ... transatlantic investment flows are the largest in the world . 
  as an eu citizen i see plenty of concrete risks in the con column , whilst the things in the pro column are nebulous at best . 
  histrionics aside this just does n't seem like a good deal from the perspective of a citizen , rather than a corporation . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/interview/analyst-isds-model-is-australia-not-canada/ ) 's an interesting article i 've read about all the isds nonsense . 
   `` you 're looking at 50,000 to 70,000 london finance jobs being moved overseas in the next 12 months , '' says one consultant working with one of the top finance strategy firms in the city . 
  `` jobs are going to be cut , and those cuts are going to start next week . '' http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/248265/london-banking-redundancies-brexit/ that does n't sound like `` a few thousand here or there '' . 
   to be fair uk is a big net contributor to the eu . 
  was n't there this map floating around a while ago that showed the uk was n't all that big a contributor ? 
  [ found it . 
   the whole thing was supposed to be a voluntary association that goes at different speeds of integration depending on the comfort level of each country . 
  err ... 
  did n't the uk veto that bit ? 
  [ yup ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/fear-of-a-two-speed-europe-britain-vetoes-changes-to-eu-treaties-a-802674.html ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure the readership of these websites skews young and activisty . 
  so whilst the copyright stuff might be what initially got them interested because it has to do with tech , the rest got them interested because it fits the rest of their readers ' profile . 
  i 'm just guessing here . 
  copyright nonsense is of interest to readers of tech websites and it 's also an integral part of trade agreements these days . 
  makes sense to me . 
  adding a single + is not that much extra trouble , is it ? 
  not in 2005 , i do n't think ? 
   there you have it . 
  concentrate on the second paragraph . 
  if , and that 's a big if , if the only reason for marriage is to produce descendants , then everybody or nobody should be granted special rights and privileges . 
  that 's nice , but we 're not dealing with coulda-woulda-shoulda 's . 
  marriage is currently a thing . 
  with it come a bazillion rights and privileges . 
  you think gay people should stop complaining and just be content with something that is similar to marriage , but does n't bring the same amount of rights and privileges . 
  why ? 
  a lot of people have pretty strong feelings about asexuality actually . 
  including in the lgbt + community . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asexuality#discrimination_and_legal_protections i 'm also pretty sure [ corrective rape ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corrective_rape ) is just as much a thing for asexuals as it is for anyone else lgbt + . 
  it can be both or either depending on who you ask . 
    and please do n't quote the bible on me ...   i would , if i could . 
  to the surprise of no one , i assure you . 
   for me the reason to support heterosexual marriage was to create a stable and self-sustaining environment to produce and bring up children . 
  some might argue , that homosexual couples could adopt children and care for them . 
  considering all scientific evidence suggests that their parents being gay has little to no effect on children , yes . 
  some might argue that . 
   extensive data available from more than 30 years of research reveal that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience with regard to social , psychological , and sexual health de - spite economic and legal disparities and social stigma . 
   there is no empirical support for the notion that the presence of both male and female role models in the home promotes adjustment among children or adolescents . 
  http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2013/03/18/peds.2013-0377.full.pdf  that could also and is done by single parents . 
  then there would be no reason to not guarantee single parents the same rights and privileges . 
  i did n't ask if marriage should be entirely abolished , i asked why you thought that gay people should just shut up and be happy with civil unions - that do n't grant anywhere near the same amount of rights as actual marriage - and leave marriage to ~ ~ the chosen ~ ~ straight people . 
   you 'd think lgbt people would be satisfied with equal rights , that 's what they and their parrots are chanting , but no , they want money . 
  or perhaps it 's just the principle of the thing . 
  do you have a good reason for why straight couples should be able to get married - with all the rights and privileges that that brings - and gay couples should settle for a watered down civil union ? 
  and please do n't quote the bible on me ... 
  cost-effectiveness is a bit of an open question too . 
   i guess its just a coincidence that we have stopped killing one another the moment these international agreements were put in place ? 
  what do those international agreements have to do with the eu though ? 
  you 're not saying the risk of war with switzerland is that much greater just because it is n't in the eu , right ? 
  because that would be kind of silly . 
  huh ? 
  what important position did he leave exactly ? 
  he 's still the minister of finance . 
  profit margins are minimal due to overcapacity . 
  this is n't half as good as it sounds .
