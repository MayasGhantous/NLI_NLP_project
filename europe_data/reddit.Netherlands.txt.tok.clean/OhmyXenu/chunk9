   the containerized-ocean-freight industry suffered in 2015 . 
  its continuing financial woes accelerated because nearly all key financial indicators declined from 2014 . 
   at the heart of the industry 's problems , a persistent global supply-and-demand imbalance is to blame . 
  all signs point to a continuation of that theme into 2016 and beyond . 
  the most-recent forecasts expect global container fleet capacity to grow by 4.6 % in 2016 , and another 4.7 % in 2017 , though spot prices for major routes have dropped 21 to 44 % from a year ago because of plunging demand ,2 now about half the current growth forecast . 
  did n't italy basically borrow money at high interest rates , just to hand it over to greece at lower rates ? 
   italy 's debt will reach a postwar record this year as the recession-hit country borrows to contribute to bailouts http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-10/italy-s-debt-to-rise-to-record-this-year-as-recession-lingers, 
   also greece has been running on a fairly large budget primary surplus ( before loan payments ) . 
  has it though ... ? 
   the church is not dead it 's not exactly healthy and thriving either though , is it ? 
   churches are being forced to make dramatic cuts due to dire financial straits and declining membership . 
  `` between 1990 and 2010 we closed 340 churches , and of those 46 were demolished , '' says thomas begrich , head of finances for the evangelical church of germany ( ekd ) , germany 's largest federation of protestant churches . 
  this , begrich says , is only the beginning . 
  `` it may be necessary to give up an additional 1,000 buildings , '' he said . 
   churches are being demolished throughout germany . 
  take , for example , the city of frankfurt am main . 
  in the 1950s , when konrad adenauer was german chancellor , there were 430,000 protestants living in the city . 
  today , that number is 110,000 . 
  these declining numbers have forced the church 's regional authorities to close every fourth house of worship . 
  truck drivers , domestic aids and construction workers are not seasonal workers , no . 
  if we were talking about the many polish people working in agriculture you 'd have a point . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.advancedfertility.com/images/2-pronuclei-embryo.jpg ) is n't . 
   earn no less than the legal minimum wage in the country they stayed on paper this may be true , in practice employers have thought up of a great many wonderful ways in which they can pay eastern europeans a great deal less . 
  [ eastern european domestic aids much cheaper . 
  ] ( http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/oost-europese-thuishulp-veel-goedkoper ) [ truck drivers from eastern europe are so much cheaper ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/handelsblad/2014/05/24/op-een-vrachtwagen-is-de-unie-pas-echt-hard-1380412 ) [ dutch construction workers out-competed by low-paid polish colleagues ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/next/2016/04/20/werknemer-van-buiten-krijgt-het-moeilijk-assche-1612370 ) could just be in the netherlands though , but i sincerely doubt it . 
   whichever are the differences between a human in this and the other stage of life it 's still a human organism . 
  but not a person . 
  otherwise why are n't you pro-life campaigning for all the placenta 's that get ~ ~ destroyed ~ ~ murdered every single day . 
  or these [ little guys ] ( https://sonjesse.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/mouse-ear.jpg ) ? 
  could it be that just having human dna and being alive are n't the only two characteristics that make up an actual , living , breathing , fully-actualized human person ? 
  a clump of human cells that barely has two neurons to rub together is not a person and so does n't have the same rights as a person . 
  well sure . 
  but there 's different degrees of danger , are n't there ? 
  christianity and islam are n't on the same level . 
   hundred of miles of sea to italy i thought lampedusa and pantelleria were much closer than that . 
   99 % of them do n't regard being faithfull to their partner as a value . 
   one thing is to accept promiscuity as a possible outcome , the other is to disregard it even when it 's an almost sure occurrence . 
   historical revolution with potentially huge social outcomes you 're doing a great job of using big words in order to sound smart and reasonable , but these statements i quoted are having the opposite effect and just make you sound like another ignorant bigot whose opinions deserve to be dismissed , then summarily ignored . 
  obviously you do n't want that , because you 're not an ignorant bigot . 
  right ? 
  just thought i 'd help out . 
   civil unions are a question of progress and civility towards other human beings , you are recognising them as a couple int he eyes of the law , with the economic rights etc. 
  civil unions by and large do n't have anywhere near the same rights as marriage though . 
  this one is no different :  however , the legislation was criticised for not providing full equality for gay couples , particularly in terms of adoption rights . 
   first of all there is not nearly enough scientific literature proving this wo n't affect the child psychology yes there is . 
   extensive data available from more than 30 years of research reveal that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience with regard to social , psychological , and sexual health de - spite economic and legal disparities and social stigma . 
   there is no empirical support for the notion that the presence of both male and female role models in the home promotes adjustment among children or adolescents . 
  http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2013/03/18/peds.2013-0377.full.pdf maybe you can link a study that shows it 's harmful ? 
  well sure . 
  it 's just that price dumping should n't happen and so is - hopefully - a temporary situation and it may well be that tata steel is perfectly profitable as long as it is n't competing with unfairly low prices from asia . 
  oh yeah they were heroes alright . 
   [ ` they raped every german female from eight to 80 ' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/01/news.features11 ), 
   the mines were unprofitable , just like the tata steel plants today does n't price dumping from asia muddy that picture a bit ? 
   all we have heard for the past 5 years as well as greece is how bad we behaved and poor we are doing i always thought portugal was generally considered a success story . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/business/global/europe-likes-portugals-progress-on-financial-overhaul.html?_r=0 http://algarvedailynews.com/news/4786-portugal-praised-for-early-imf-loan-repayment, 
  it 's somewhat relevant though , no ? 
  there 's plenty of lgbt refugees . 
  even from [ syria ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/refugees-europe-migrants-shelters-gay-asylum-seekers-attack-abuse-lgbt/ ) . 
  that 's under westminster economic policy that is specifically tailored to london though . 
   the still have to go to the back if the eu application line no they do n't , because there exists no `` application line '' . 
  that 's just another bit of scaremongering . 
      the npo and avrotros said to the ad however that the story is completely bogus . 
  `` this is absolutely not the case '' . 
      you should tell the complete story , these are unconfirmed allegations . 
  they even tried to research these allegations , and there 's no hint of these stories being true . 
  so there 's no official paper-trail of this . 
  wow . 
  quelle surprise . 
  what possible reason could these police officers have for making this up ? 
   but the notion that the left in general is playing identity politics is simply not true . 
  err ... 
  remind me again how kuzu and ozturk ever entered politics ? 
  oh right , the pvda recruited them specifically because they are of turkish ancestry and they wanted to get the turkish vote . 
  apparently not even bothering to do a proper values-check to see what they 're all about , considering how this completely backfired . 
   first of all , pc culture is n't even a thing in mainstream dutch politics . 
  it is n't ? 
  http://www.ad.nl/binnenland/overheid-en-npo-willen-minder-marokkanen-in-opsporing-verzocht~aaf87f04/ for those who do n't understand dutch the government asked a show where citizens are asked to help with crimes if it could feature fewer immigrants , because it would make for a better representation of dutch society . 
  imagine obama calling the fbi to ask if they could put fewer black men on their most wanted list , because it might give some people the wrong idea . 
  i feel kind of bad for the people there who * do * pay taxes though . 
  some rates are sky-high just to compensate for all the others who do n't pay a dime , it seems like . 
  2017 is very much a peak-year though , the rest is much more favourable . 
   the public benefitted from less state interference . 
  uh-huh . 
  https://www.opendemocracy.net/ournhs/caroline-molloy/what%27s-really-causing-ae-crisis-and-how-can-we-fix-it you keep stating things as fact with nothing to back it up . 
  there 's a lot of self-segregation of muslims in the netherlands at least . 
  children that have their first contact with the dutch language at the age of 4 when they go to school , because they 're raised in a cultural bubble before that . 
  and then they do n't do well in school due to language deficiencies and end up in low-paying , not-too-solid jobs . 
  but sure . 
  let 's blame it all on the native population being literally hitler . 
  not sure what you 're saying , but there 's plenty of bombs going off by muslim hands in asia surely . 
   to be fair , it 's asking about favorability not whether they want to leave or not but the numbers are : well there you go then . 
  https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/10/19/steeds-minder-mensen-zijn-te-porren-voor-een-nexit-4893653-a1527433 25 % would have voted for nexit in mid-oktober and that number had been trending downwards , so it 's probably even lower now . 
   also private enterprises are typically much more efficient than public ones . 
  that 's one of those thing that gets repeated all the time as truth when in actuality it probably is n't . 
  all the polls were right actually . 
  brexit winning was well within the margin of error and clinton was slated to win bigly in the popular vote and she did . 
  the biggest proponent for an exit from the eu for the netherlands has not mentioned it one single time in his recent election campaign . 
  i think that tells you exactly how popular nexit is in this country . 
  hint : it really , really is n't . 
  the netherlands does n't actually need to hide behind the eu .
