it 's way different from all other dutch cities because it was completely bombed to the ground , and i 'm not a huge fan . 
  goeie-ouwe-henk is a retard . 
  gives a bad reputation to dutch redditors . 
  amsterdam because of the mass tourism , rotterdam because rotterdam . 
  haha this is great . 
  remia for most sauces , heinz for ketchup , zaanse hoeve and calve for mayonaise . 
  liesje leerde loesje lopen langs de lange linden laan and de kat krabt de krullen van de trap . 
  why ? 
  we never had trees to begin with . 
  definitely not dutch, 
  ca n't go wrong with italy . 
  same , especially the other dutch users and that guy from denmark , / u/tonygaze i believe . 
  my comment was about all regions trivial to europeans , not specifically us states . 
  i think he got the wrong impression . 
  it 's just a meta comment . 
  i hate people who have opinions . 
  this questions are getting sillier by the minute . 
  i mean , what opinion is there to have on alaska ? 
   many kids are obliged to bring bags of over 15 kgs i want to see proof first . 
  in every country in the world they say `` ugh my backpack must be 20kgs '' , which in reality is of course hugely exaggerated . 
  buy one from a drug dealer . 
  tell me about it, 
  i do n't have a source but i 'd say nyc - la/sf - chicago - florida, 
  ... wow, 
  cycling without hands makes chinese tourists go wild, 
  bad bot, 
  sorry for the links , i 'm on holiday, 
  only [ these ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=bittergarnituur&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;prmd=imsvn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjygl252alvahxci8akhdj8akaq_auicsgb&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=560#tbm=isch&amp;q=mini+kaassouffle ) have cheese in them .

   * idk , i think i had like 7 subjects in secondary school i had more but did exams in 7 , was this the same for you ? 
   * no homework , because you spend extra time at school making the work . 
  sounds like heaven to me, 
  i live in a bible belt town and it 's massively exaggerated how bad it is to live here . 
  shops are n't open on sundays , * oh nooo * . 
  where are you from ? 
  it 's not one building though . 
  some schools have a building for every level of education ( vmbo-havo-vwo ) and a building just for first graders of all levels . 
  i do n't think 3000 + schools are common though . 
  a 350 + basisschool is also very big . 
  i do n't know where he 's from . 
  same , not even the biggest school in the city ( 28.000 inhabitants ), 
  ssh bby is ok, 
  there 's no such thing as people killed per capita, 
  this route is very inefficient though, 
   zierikzee i hated that town . 
  it 's like they never learned smoking is bad for you ; all cute restaurants where you could sit outside were ruined by people smoking heavy shag . 
  town was n't very special either . 
  middelburg was a lot better . 
   and you like cock ? 
  ( sorry , i 'm trying to figure out the narrative here ) is that really the best thing you could come up with ? 
   how 's ronnie flex controversial ? 
  some hate his sound some love it . 
  does n't help that he did a performance on tv ( i believe it was the final of the voice of holland , very high amount of viewers ) and his autotone did n't work on tv , only in the tv studio . 
  turns out he 's not very good live . 
  also he 's notorious for his salty reactions when he gets beer thrown at him during performances , once he left and another time he said the mom of the guy who threw should die of cancer . 
  i believe he gave in to the beer throwing nowadays though . 
  oh , yeah ... and drugs, 
  lijpe , mula b , louivos , frenna , sfb , 3robi , soufiane eddyani ( he 's actually belgian , made a great collab with boef imo ) , ronnie flex ( controversial ) take a look at top notch on youtube, 
  someone clearly does n't listen to dutch rap, 
  the waddenzee , veluwe ? 
  your comment history is okay , so why are you trolling ? 
  weak bait 1.5 / 10, 
  go away troll . 
  do n't forget how many people go to belgium/germany to buy fireworks and turn the country into a warzone . 
  the city centre felt so ordinary . 
  wow , all national days here are so boring , just come to ours !, 
  how obvious does it have to be ? 
  nike , adidas and asics are popular shoe brands for ages 0-30, 
  so far i went to canterbury for a week ( part of bilingual education programme ) , denmark for an exchange ( same ) , ypres ( ww1 themed trip ) , amsterdam ( economics ) , the hague ( social studies ) , texel ( sailing trip ) , austria ( skiing trip ) , and the us ( pella , iowa and chicago , obligatory internship abroad ) . 
  in september i 'll take a train trip through switzerland , germany , austria , czech republic and italy ( exams trip ) , next year i 'll go to austria on skiing trip again and the last trip is a fun one to scotland with a teacher who studied there . 
  during the year there are many museum trips that bring you anywhere around the country . 
  this is all part of the bilingual high school programme . 
  i 'm fully aware that i 'm extremely spoiled when it comes to travelling . 
  new zealand in summer and canada/austria in winter, 
  same, 
   it 's okay to hate the amerifats . 
  they call use yuropoors . 
  downvote usa . 
  that 's what he said , clearly just a lost troll . 
  you 're not even european nor do you post on this sub, 
  turbo  nitro, 
  i 'd say 95 % of the people here are 25 or younger so i do n't think you 'll get many responses . 
  skiing is love, 
  snatch !, 
  why did you move to australia ? 
  it really does n't have a target group , it 's just another spanish pop song that you get every year that just has to remind people of summer in order to get as popular as possible . 
  apparently i 'm pretty good at guessing songs , but as long as you guess 1 in 25 drunk people will be impressed anyway . 
  do n't forget how our former pm [ fell off a skateboard on tv ] ( https://youtu.be/gbfwlxacogw ) . 
  us/canada culture for the sports, 
  i ment the poem by wilfred owen , which is supposed to be ironic . 
  chocomel , 
  van persie but not sneijder , lol . 
  most dutch highways have a speed limit of 130kph , you get a fine starting at 136kph . 
  for someone who looks like they 're very interested in linguistics that 's a strange reaction . 
  why do n't you use your countries ' flair ? 
  same goes for everyone with a eu flair . 
  disneyland paris is always a hit or miss . 
  do n't be suprised when you see 3 hour queues .
