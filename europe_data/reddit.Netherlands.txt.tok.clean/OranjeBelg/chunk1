i love how europe is united when germany and belgium want it to be but as soon as a serious issue presents itself they just pull out this is a dutch proposal . 
  hilarious how what you 're accusing belgium and germany of doing is the exact shit eastern europe is pulling ; `` gib money '' , `` i am viry sorry my friend , i not space for arab , not can help you . '', 
  oh and stop hiding behind the union jack , you 're not british . 
  it 's frustrating to think about how many of our current problems we would n't be facing today if the eu never expanded to the east . 
   southern europe allowing all the migrants in , athens is using it as a weapon for more money . 
  i would n't even be surprised if they 're enjoying this . 
   eastern europe allowing all the weapons from the balkan into europe with belgium as the unfortunate destination . 
  they do n't care as long as the weapons leave their territory - this is people we share a borderless union with . 
  i support a close germanic union next to the eu ( a eu of two speeds if you will ) !, 
  schengen needs to be abolished , a mini-schengen needs to be created , free movement of people and goods can stay as it is . 
  portugal is at least a million times better than all of the wealth of morocco , algeria , syria , somalia , afghanistan and eritrea combined . 
  consider yourself to be lucky that so little of the choosing beggars accepted . 
  thank you for the solidarity , you 're unlike eastern europe , a true team player !, 
  are n't canadians very eager to accept thousands of syrians themselves ? 
  did n't trudeau win because he vowed to allow a hundred thousand syrians into the country ? 
  nope , defense is federal and benelux . 
  eh , you 're talking about a small country with a coastline of a mere 60 kilometers . 
  if anything , your comment is pathetic . 
  nope , this is a new proposal . 
  99 % of the average dutch person would rather die then call themselves german , do n't let polandball fool you . 
  prepare for the downvotes , my friend . 
  sweden and germany , that 's pretty much it . 
  the article if it is behind a paywall . 
  het is het uwe . 
  the article if it is behind a paywall . 
  het is het uwe . 
   i am all for immigration , its what my country was founded on immigration from europe and africa , yes . 
  the rest is bullshit . 
  seems like you 're butthurt but by all means , be my guest and form your own border zone , we 'd absolutely love that !, 
  moroccan and algerian people , huh ? 
  the exact same demographic that 's joining is en masse ? 
  the demographic that 's over represented in crime statistics ? 
  allowing them in is the most stupid thing we can do . 
  belgium is fucked by its geographical location , it 's centrally located in europe 's most populated and prosperous region . 
  brussels , paris , amsterdam , frankfurt , london are all a couple of hours drive away . 
  we need to protect our borders , not only from refugees but also from weapons getting smuggled into schengen . 
  at least italy is doing its job , ca n't say the same thing about countries bordering the balkan countries . 
  schengen needs to be abolished and a mini-schengen needs to be created , preferable partners are all western countries , excluding greece , the baltic countries and poland . 
  the rest needs to leave . 
  this is the first time since more than 25 years that belgium has a right-wing government , you have failed sir . 
   you read too much polandball many comments here are based on what 's posted on polandball , it 's pathetic . 
  oh dear god , you have no idea what a burqa is , do you ? 
  google is your friend . 
  you 're talking about a hijab . 
  i will not be replying to your comments anymore as you clearly have no idea what you 're discussing . 
  most stable it definitely is but it is n't the most inclusive for minorities , belgium is . 
  have you been living under a rock ? 
  western europe , from sweden to spain , is having anti-terrorist operations every single day . 
  `` you 're a bigot . '', 
   this seems to be a particularly belgian problem . 
  who says that this is n't the belgian government 's goal ? 
  to have more control over its people ? 
  remember that when one country does this in europe , more will follow very quickly . 
   netherlands - i do n't know much but they seem progressive , well-developed , rich ... ca n't think of many negatives . 
  it 's more about the system we have , which is pretty autocratic ( not classic autocracy of course , but it could be more democratic than it currently is ) and not that progressive at all . 
  the political climate is horrible as well , we 're very polarized in this country and our governments are n't as stable anymore as they used to be . 
   ** united kingdom ** , switzerland , ** netherlands ** . 
  haha !, 
  seriously , why though ? 
  again , 0 value has been added by people like yourself who stand by the sidelines screaming . 
  pretty much my entire life as i 'm an ex-muslim . 
  why are you asking ? 
  wearing a bikini to the supermarket on an average day without going to the beach or a swimming pool , yup that 's trashy . 
  i am not belgian either , i am dutch and lots of cities globally have a similar law in place . 
  likewise , as your comment just confirms to me that either you 've no idea what a burqa is or you 've no idea how muslims themselves view people who wear them . 
  stay out of the discussion if you 've nothing of value to say outside of ignorance . 
  yes , they are if they voluntarily wear it or their environment is if they 're being forced . 
  the netherlands is nowhere near the top . 
  still more valuable than `` it 's stupid because i think it is . '', 
  and then desperately linking this with other phenomenon . 
  / u/trollabot spliffa, 
   you act as if you 've invented hot water . 
  ** these things have all been tried , it does n't work with the radicalized folk . 
  ** people who wear burqas are radical , it 's a fact . 
  this law attempts to curb them , not the average muslim . 
   how do you get up in the morning when everything is so hopeless ? 
  realism is a thing you know , got ta try it sometime . 
   but nah , you 're right , instead of going through puberty muslims go through natural radicalization . 
  because that is exactly what i said . 
  ( / s cause clearly it 's necessary with the attitudes around here )  we 'd just be fighting nature to so much as treat them like human beings . 
  they are being treated as human beings . 
  sick ? 
  universal healthcare is there to help you . 
  education ? 
  here you go . 
  want to go to uni ? 
  here 's funding . 
  need a job ? 
  here 's a social program that aims to employ people fitting your profile . 
  having a hard time learning the language ? 
  here 's some free classes , do n't worry about income , we 've got you on this . 
  having a hard time feeding your children ? 
  we 've got this for you . 
  what the fuck do you want us to do for them ? 
  this is n't the us , most of us do not invite strangers to dinner , muslim or not . 
   the bikini law is just stupid and i wonder if it is the result of the integration mess in belgium . 
  because it 's people who want to wear a bikini whilst going to the supermarket that turn into radicals ? 
  sweden is n't a beacon of integration either , you 're the second country with the most is fighters per capita . 
  other factors play into this as well , belgium has more muslims than sweden originating from countries who supply is the most with fighters like morocco , do n't pat yourselves on your backs . 
  sounds pretty awesome .
