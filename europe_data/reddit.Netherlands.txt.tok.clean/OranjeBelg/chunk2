  it 's trashy and local governments do n't like it . 
  one can argue that it is oppressive and whatever but the point here is that muslims and in particular , radical muslims are n't being picked out , everyone is . 
  oh sure . 
  here we go : ca n't run nude in public , nudists feel pretty discriminated by that . 
  i had a vision last night , god came to me and said that from now on , i have to be naked 24/7 whilst having a dildo inside of my ass and carry an aluminium hat . 
  should i be allowed to run like this in public ? 
  if no , why not ? 
  talking out of our asses again , are we ? 
  belgium prohibits people from wearing a bikini in public , outside the beach and the likes . 
  people who do so will get fined . 
  your turn ? 
   regularly inviting them over for dinner `` western food is haram , i do n't trust them . '', 
  `` they have a dog , they 're not clean . '', 
  `` i do n't speak the language . '', 
  '' ... ''  playing with their kids that already happens . 
  they radicalize at a later stage in their lives despite having played with western children and adults in their childhood . 
   making sure they know about go to associations and clubs ( sports , culture , games , etc ) , nope , not going to happen . 
  they form their own associations and clubs , often religiously inspired . 
  think of burqa/veiled women-only swimming classes . 
  you act as if you 've invented hot water . 
  these things have all been tried , it does n't work with the radicalized folk . 
  why should i care about western expats ? 
  the country they 're living in should enforce its local laws if they wish to do so , i do n't mind . 
  - excuse , can you remove your mask so that i can confirm you 're the person on your legal identification document ? 
  `` yes , sure officer '' - excuse me , can you remove your veil so that i can confirm you 're the person on your legal identification document ? 
  `` no , it 's haram . '', 
  * proceeds to make a scene , causing a crowd to form and posing a potential danger to the officer *, 
  5k/month sounds awesome until you realize 3k goes to rent in schweiz . 
  whenever i 'm in northern france , i always see women wearing burqas roaming shopping malls and hypermarkets despite it being against the law . 
  i do n't think there 's that many saudi tourists in the lille - roncq area . 
  freedom to oppress and freedom to be exempted from civil law applied to all other citizens ? 
  france , belgium and now switzerland . 
  pretty sure a trend has been set . 
  haha , it is you who has n't been following the news lately . 
  keep sticking your head into the sand though if it makes you and the 36 people who upvoted your worthless comment happier . 
  there 's tons of reason why we 're being called the lost generation . 
   the north atlantic council will meet this afternoon in brussels in response to the downing of the aircraft by nato member turkey . 
  what a mess we 're in these days ; brussels is under threat of an cowardly attack , the city they 're meeting in . 
  turkey shot down a russian airplane supposedly in syrian airspace , refugees have flooded europe and will continue to do so , the uk is threatening to leave the union , france has been attacked , ukraine is at war , religious tensions are rising , the far right is gaining ground , ... 
  the following years will be very dark in western europe . 
   in may of this year washington issued requests to extend the program to 10 airports in nine other countries -- ** belgium , the netherlands , the uk , sweden , norway , spain ** , japan , turkey and dominican republic -- though it remains to be seen how many of them will agree . 
  only dublin and shannon , both in ireland , at the moment . 
  well , it 's mostly ( north ) african immigrants belgium but also my country , france and others are experiencing problems with . 
  as mentioned , belgium had a large influx of italians and other europeans as well , they 're just as in sweden integrated and even assimilated . 
   that will make you love french , german and dutch tv . 
   ftfy . 
  remember that a majority speak dutch in belgium , not french . 
  except for the small maoist/communist flemish party , no other political party believes this in flanders from what i can gather living in this country and following its politics . 
  the ps , the french socialist party , is insane though and i 'd blame them for most , if not all , of the problems the country is facing on a federal level today . 
  it 's unimaginable to think that the ps would score more than 5 % in the netherlands . 
  it would n't be a risk for its neighbors if we did n't allow the guns to be smuggled into the country . 
  belgium segregated these people from its native citizen . 
  we tried to blend them in and it 's a daily occurrence now that someone gets beaten up for no reason by `` mocro 's '' , turks and antilleans in the netherlands . 
  there 's a reason why wilders is topping to polls again , do n't act as if we do n't have neighborhoods like this . 
  edit : of course utter shit gets upvoted , thanks / r/europe , you never fail to amaze me !, 
  belgium was throughout history one of the most prosperous countries in europe and the world , it was the first industrialized country on the continent and second in the world ( after the uk of course ) . 
  they had a flourishing coal industry and needed tons of guest workers to work in the mines . 
  they imported moroccans , turks and italians the most . 
  the mines , of course , have closed since then and flanders ( dutch belgium ) has moved towards an innovative industry whilst wallonia ( french/german belgium ) , where most of these mines were , stayed behind . 
  needless to say , many of these people are unemployed . 
  sweden was poor during the 60 's and thus missed that import wave of third world immigrants . 
  brussels and charleroi , not `` all over belgium '' . 
   no casualties . 
  during one search the suspect sped away in his car , police officers fired two shots . 
  later on he was apprehended by other agents , suspect was wounded . 
  that 's incorrect actually . 
  the prosecutor said that a car drove into police officers who were raiding a snackbar in molenbeek , brussels . 
  after he drove into them , police reacted by firing two shots . 
  he was later arrested at a different location in brussels . 
  dutch authorities ? 
  if schengen did n't exist , these scum would n't have the weapons they have today . 
  they 're all being smuggled in from the balkan countries , the schengen countries bordering them are n't doing their jobs . 
  this is why my country proposed a mini-schengen with belgium but without most other eu countries . 
  the tent camp in the center of town has been broken down a month or so ago . 
  it 's been like this long before rutte came to power . 
  even that would 've been more effective than building a bridge in the middle of nowhere . 
  spain has had an issue of building infrastructure not a soul on the planet plans to use , the bridge will probably be added to that list . 
  ah , keynesian policies are being adopted by madrid i see . 
  no , you can not as this is a regional affair in belgium . 
  is the city of london responsible for alcohol consumption ? 
  do n't think so . 
   what these stats are good for is showing what the country should be doing as a whole , that the government has big problems that it needs to focus on . 
  did you even read my comment ? 
  ** the federal government of belgium is not responsible for this ** , it is a regional affair . 
  exactly why it is incredibly silly to lump the country altogether . 
  sorry to burst your bubble . 
  jesus , stop the tears . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  i 've written that i was only joking , how sensitive can one fucking be ? 
  provide evidence that at least one eu country is directly buying petroleum from is , please . 
   so we do n't stop the oil , but we stop bitcoin . 
  what ?!, 
  how do you propose we stop `` the oil '' ? 
  last time i checked , there 's an actual need for oil , our prosperity depends on it today . 
  bitcoin is trash , we 'll do perfectly fine without it . 
  itt : people who have bought bitcoin . 
  nope , not many people live in denmark . 
  * eastern europe . 
  ^ i 'm ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ joking ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ course . 
  again flanders is being screwed by these statistics that just lump in the entire country together whilst child poverty is a regional affair if i remember correctly .
