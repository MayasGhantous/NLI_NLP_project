jo hawwe it recht . 
  i see a lot of `` me '' ( my ) instead of `` mijn '' ( mine ) under younger people lately . 
  - stanley mes - breakable knife ( or whatever you call extending knives where you can break off a piece after it gets dull ) - bacho - adjustable spanner - flex - angle grinder - jeep - mostly used for short-wheelbase 4x4 all-terrain cars - luxaflex - horizontal panel window blinds, 
  in the 60s-70s it became socially accepted . 
  now it 's almost expected to have been with a few partners before committing to someone in marriage . 
  i know , i 've had a few . 
  i always lose those for some reason ... :(, 
  what is this `` cash '' you speak of ? 
  is it some relic from pre-euro utopia ? 
  i just walk into the coffee shop and pay for the drugs with my debit card !, 
  no but seriously , we do still have a few atms around ( i 'd say about 10 in my city of around 100k people ) . 
  although i ca n't really remember the last time i paid with cash over here . 
  the last time probably was when i came back from holiday and still had some left over . 
  oh , and i always have a few coins in my car for shopping carts at supermarkets . 
  i 'm in a ~ 45 m2 apartment . 
  built originally in 1930 as a retirement complex for elderly people and converted to social housing apartments in the 80s . 
  i pay around $ 450/month + $ 20/month for parking . 
  i 'm about 15 minutes away from my office by bike . 
  i 'm co-owner of a small company and for our office we pay the ridiculously low rent of only $ 70/month . 
  but that 's because it 's through a `` anti-squatting '' agency . 
  they also have dutch and english versions on their site , there 's a button in the top right . 
  and there 's [ af\u00fbk ] ( http://afuk.frl/about ) for the frisian minority language . 
  i think the netherlands is similar in that everyone has whatsapp . 
  there are even whatsapp neighbourhood watch/crime prevention groups , with official street signs and everything . 
  aside from this , i think most people also have facebook . 
  many younger people seem to use instagram and snapchat to connect with their peers , but would use facebook or whatsapp to talk to parents . 
  in the netherlands we used to have hyves.nl , which was somewhat inbetween ( what used to be ? ), 
  myspace and facebook . 
  the guy who started it sold it just before facebook really took off and made a fortune . 
  the new owners failed to make money out of it and basically took everything offline and changed the whole website into a [ shitty flash games hub ] ( http://hyves.nl/ ) , only retaining the name . 
  great weather !, 
  thanks for all the suggestions !, 
  i had a look around yesterday when i was in a supermarket . 
  sadly they had none of the mentioned brands , but i 'll look around some more !, 
  really ? 
  can you name a few ? 
  i only know nutella , and maybe some cheaper supermarket branded stuff that 's far worse . 
  i 'm interested to try some others !, 
  being able to visit my family in germany just by driving in a car for a little while . 
  the only difference between the town my grandma lives in and the one i do is that they celebrate carnaval down there and speak german intead of dutch . 
  welfare `` handouts '' are cut off if you do n't accept the first job offered to you . 
  this is now actually causing problems . 
  because paying people a welfare `` handout '' of around $ 800 is cheaper than minimum wage , some people get fired and then essentially forced to do the same job for less money . 
  people who have a low paying , low skill job , like cleaning streets for example , get fired because their job gets replaced by people who have to do this kind of work to keep their welfare `` handouts '' ( these can be the same people who got fired from the same job ! ) . 
  edit : other benefits `` poor '' people receive ( even if you make over minimum wage you can be eligible for these ) are tax cuts , subsidies for rent and health insurance , and some others . 
  here was some speculation that a few wolves moved over from germany a while ago , but i 'm not sure whether that actually happened . 
  other than that there are some adders and the occasional deer . 
  as for most dangerous , i 'd say ticks , since they often carry lyme disease . 
  oh , and of course we have storks , herons and peewits ( northern lapwing . 
  oh and eels , the slimy muddy ones . 
  though i guess none of these are really dangerous , unusual or exotic ... we basically murdered anything that could kill us centuries ago . 
  it was on the news , but not much more than `` this happened '' .

  thank you !, 
  for the uninformed like me , what would that sound like ? 
   howitzer interesting , according to [ this ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/howitzer#english ) it 's from dutch . . ? 
  and , to spoil all the fun , [ all of these ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/category:english_terms_derived_from_dutch ) . 
  some fun ones from that list : commodore , commandeer , compound , holster , freebooter , brewery , gas , gin .

  although in reality that 's never going to happen . 
  i do think the netherlands might lose some more authority over its caribbean islands . 
  but on the other hand , they 're so small , it 's hard to imagine them ever being able to sustain themselves . 
  earthquakes do n't really happen in the netherlands ( except in groningen where we artificially generate them to scientifically test the social implications on people and how the government can best screw it 's citizens over ) , but i did actually experience on in northern australia . 
  it felt like someone was wobbling my chair and i thought i was hallucinating . 
  only after it happened i realized it must have been an earthquake , which was then confirmed later in the news to have been around 3.5 on the richter scale . 
  how can you know if you 've never had one ? 
  to quote [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leeuwarden ) :  the oldest remains of houses in the city date back to the 2nd century ad  ... has been permanently inhabited since the 10th century, 
  same for me . 
  writing is a bit ... challenging , sadly . 
  haha , funny how that stuff goes . 
  i 've tried sever times to switch from dutch to frysk with friends , but it never really sticks . 
   if you and your gf were to have kids ... do you plan on one of you speaking frysk to them ? 
  you know to keep the language alive . 
  that 's what i plan on doing , i 'm gon na speak frysk to my kids even if i do n't raise them inside of frysl\u00e2n . 
  hmm , i have n't really thought about it . 
  i 'd like to , i think . 
  but since we 're ( still ) talking dutch , i think it 's unlikely it 'd really change if we have kids . 
  i think i 'll try though , and we might ask our parents to speak frysk to their grandchildren . 
  but to be honest , i can barely take care of myself , so i do n't think kids would be a good idea any time soon ... , 
  whoa , we basically have the same story !, 
  my mother is dutch ( german actually , but came to nl long before i was born ) and my father frisian . 
  i usually speak dutch to people i meet as well , and unless we quickly find out we 're both frysk , it 's too late to switch . 
  my girlfriend also speaks frysk , but we speak dutch with eachother . 
  but when we 're with a friend who i normally speak frysk to , it gets all weird . 
  sometimes you end up switching languages halfway through sentences . 
   it 's still the same old deprecated building but now it has a fancy sounding name ; leeuwarder lyceum ugh ... 
  they should renovate that shit . 
   i went to multiple `` piter jelles '' schools in leeuwarden . 
  so did i !, 
  dropped out in 4e klas at aldlan though ...  when i text/app a friend a speak frysk with i usually just type it in dutch . 
  ( though that kinda weird because some of my friends answer back in frysk and that makes me feel like i 'm personally responsible for the decline of our culture ) yeah i have that too . 
  mostly with my dad :( otherwise there is n't really much use for it in everyday life . 
  where did you go to school ? 
  i hated frysk , mostly because our teacher was a really boring old man . 
  and i already spoke it anyway , though now i wish i had paid a bit more attention as my writing is terrible . 
  we only had it in the first year iirc . 
  ah yes , mine was a history teacher that gave maatschappijleer on the side . 
  i later chose the technical profile with economy and philosophy so i believe i only had maatschappijleer for one year . 
  heh , it seems your maatschapijleer teacher was much more in to it than mine !, 
  when i was in havo we never really learned more than how government functioned and how it came to be .
