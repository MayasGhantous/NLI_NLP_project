  but that was nearly 15 years ago ( geez it seems like yesterday . 
  i feel a bit old suddenly ! ) . 
  when were you in school ? 
  maybe things changed ... 
  though i kind of like the idea , i do n't think students attending a meeting ( or even a lecture by a spokesperson ) of every party would/could ever be done . 
  we have over 80 ( i think ? 
  a lot anyway ) parties currently running for elections so as a matter of practicality it 's basically impossible to visit/attend each one at least once . 
  and visiting only one or a few would be considered unfair advantage and likely lead to outrage . 
  however there are plenty of extracurricular activities involving ( often local ) politics , and many parties have a youth organisation as well . 
  when i was in school there was a 3 day program each year where you 'd `` simulate '' a local government . 
  students of several schools would form imaginary political parties and debate real world ( local ) issues . 
  you 'd come up with proposals and laws ( the same way an actual counsel would do it , with all the same rules , etc ) , and generally make policy . 
  at the end of the program , the `` passed '' laws were given for review to real politicians who would give feedback and ( potentially , presumably if they liked it ) bring it up in a real counsel meeting . 
  i took part in it once and had a pretty good time . 
  it was a valuable lesson in reasons behind policy , making compromises , considering consequences and generally learning about politics . 
  normal teachers . 
  course material is not a lesson in ethics or opinions , but in history and systems of government . 
  it teaches how the government functions and how it came to function that way . 
  it 's not about individual laws or policy . 
  edit : i should mention this was my experience , nearly 15 years ago . 
  things may have changed . 
  yes please !, 
  though esa is doing cool stuff , i 'd gladly pay an extra few euros for more funding . 
  i also believe ( hope ) we 're on the verge of true commercial space exploration in the form of asteroid mining . 
  if that takes off i think it might change a lot about the way we live . 
  do n't you want a holiday home on mars when you retire ? 
  i 'd say that more money to esa indirectly increases money to universities through research grants , etc. 
  also `` uw '' / `` jou ( w ) '' for `` your '' . 
  and to add , i think it 's mostly age related : * in general it 's considered polite to address older people and strangers in the formal way . 
  * peers and younger people are usually addressed informal . 
  * children are ** always ** addressed informal . 
  by this logic , it 's normal for kids to address the teacher formally , and for teachers to address the kids informally . 
  being called `` u '' for the first time by a stranger/kid is something every teen will experience . 
  exception to age is that it 's somewhat expected to address `` important people '' ( those of `` higher '' social class ) formally . 
  additionally , `` hij/zij '' ( he/she ) used to be considered impolite . 
  the proper way used to be for example `` mister [ last name ] '' . 
  i remember being reprimanded by a teacher for saying `` hij '' when talking about another teacher at school . 
  nowadays it 's even common for state tv to use `` hij '' when talking about our king ... 
  / r/frisia is for the entire frisian area . 
  it 's not very active though, 
  whoa , this is great !, 
  except ... not quite . 
  the problem currently , in my opinion , is that there are many niche , one-issue parties right now ( around 80 in total !, 
  ) , yet there are very few `` general '' parties around . 
  the ones that do exist are generally the established/older parties that are very busy with infighting and blaming each other for crap . 
  none of the niche parties presents a decent , general agenda . 
  i care about internet freedom , but i also care about economic growth , education , europe , health , climate change , drug policy , etc. 
  the for each of these things there is a niche party , but there does n't seem to be one that i agree with on the vast majority of points . 
  except maybe d66 , but they just seem to lack some ... spirit . 
  if you 're not home , they take it to a warehouse somewhere ( in my case 35 minutes by car [ to drachten , i 'm in leeuwarden ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/dir/leeuwarden/drachten/@53.0881959,5.820627,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c8fef2953ab5ef:0x543dbba8c956a9b6!2m2!1d5.7999133!2d53.2012334!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c8502d34dc13d7:0x8ee972c991cd0fa0!2m2!1d6.0586373!2d53.0925814!3e0?hl=nl ) ) without notifying you . 
  i 've had 2 international parcels returned to sender when i did n't pick it up within a week . 
  i 've learned to become really paranoid when it comes to dhl , checking delivery status religiously from the moment it is sent . 
  i was on st. maarten on a family holiday when i was around 10 or so . 
  ( my dad has a friend that worked there for a while ) i mostly remember the weather being nice , but not much else . 
  i think i might visit some day if i 'm ever in the area ( like the us or south america ) , but otherwise i probably wo n't . 
  it 's an expensive and long journey just for some sunshine . 
  i think that was once a normal thing everywhere , before refrigerators were invented . 
  but you would n't really need a big pickup with half a meter of ground clearance either . 
  would n't [ this ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=transit+van&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj3iqjm1k7rahvc0xokhrjpay4q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=945 ) be more practical ? 
  netherlands : most have already been mentioned , but there are some more . 
  * awesomenauts * lethal league * halo : spartan assault * convoy and i 'm not sure if it counts , but most tomb raider games , as well as the modern deus ex games have had their pc ports done in the netherlands . 
  additionally , the new game from hideo kojima , death stranding , is being built in the killzone engine , and co-developed in the netherlands . 
  netherlands : mostly . 
  though i do n't trust them with anything related to computers . 
  too many fuck-ups in the past and lots of dumb/unfounded arguments . 
  but it 's not that i think they 're actively trying to do things against the public 's best interest , it 's more that they seem to be totally incompetent . 
  however , we have elections coming up next year , and there are a lot of things going on . 
  we now have so many political parties that i ca n't even name them all , and more seem to be showing up each month . 
  i 'm somewhat worried about this trend . 
  that 's so awesome !, 
  i 'd love to see/partake in that some day !, 
  the assen tt is pretty big , and there 's lots of oldtimer stuff around . 
  paris-dakar is also quite a thing with annual events , etc. 
  and max verstappen is making f1 come back with the general public . 
  i ca n't remember the exact place , but it was somewhere around eksj\u00f6 - j\u00f6nk\u00f6ping - mj\u00f6lby if i recall correctly . 
  it was in 2014 . 
  this , mostly . 
  among my friends i think i know exactly one person who calls himself a christian , one person who is an active practising muslim , and a few who are very serious about atheism . 
  most just do n't care . 
  come to think of it , i also know a jew !, 
  i feel very multicultural now . 
  this really came as a surprise to me and a few friends when we got stuck in a small village in the middle of nowhere after hiking for 4 days . 
  the bus only accepted cash !, 
  fortunately the lady in the local shop was really nice and we had a lot of coffee and ice cream before one of us found a lift and gout our car . 
  not all right-leaning people are eurosceptic nazis , nor are all left-leaning people pacifist hippies . 
  there 's a lot more in between . 
  to add to this , we have the [ oldest working planetarium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eisinga_planetarium ) in the world . 
  built by wool carder and amateur astronomer eise eisinga * into * his own house in 1781 . 
   the `` face '' of the model looks down from the ceiling of what used to be his living room , with most of the mechanical works in the space above the ceiling . 
  [ 3 ] it is driven by a pendulum clock , which has 9 weights or ponds . 
  the planets move around the model in real time , automatically . 
  ( a slight `` re-setting '' must be done by hand every four years to compensate for the february 29th of a leap year . ), 
  the planetarium includes a display for the current time and date . 
  the plank that has the year numbers written on it has to be replaced every 22 years . 
   the eise eisinga planetarium is the oldest still working planetarium in the world . 
   to create the gears for the model , 10,000 handmade nails were used . 
  [ 4 ] in addition to the basic orrery , there are displays of the phase of the moon and other astronomical phenomena . 
   the orrery was constructed to a scale of 1:1,000,000,000,000 ( 1 millimetre : 1 million kilometres ) . 
  i still find this a bit of an odd claim ... 
  they abolished all previous city * rights * , to have equal law/rights in the whole country .
