  but where did they explicitly state that these places were no longer to be called cities ? 
  and why/how is amsterdam an exception to the rest ? 
  just because the constitution mentions amsterdam as a city does n't automatically mean the rest is n't any longer . 
  i think you mean : `` waar heb je het over ? '', 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/city_rights_in_the_low_countries#grants_of_city_rights.2c_chronologically_2 ) , although very late , the hague got city rights in 1806 . 
  everything is fun on mdma . 
   there is a very popular conspiracy theory that `` jews ... along with soros pay muslims to invade europe '' . 
  hah , that 's a funny one !, 
  i thought jews and muslims hated each other . 
  or is that just israel ? 
   horde of refugees and the islam taking over etc. 
  this is n't the actual problem but rather more a manifestation of anger and feeling `` unheard '' . 
  it 's the same reason the uk voted for brexit . 
  not because the people really wanted to leave , but because they felt unheard . 
  same with our ukraine referendum , where most voters did n't really care , but those that felt like their problems were n't heard and thus hated the establishment all voted against it . 
  vrij nederland has an [ interesting interview ( dutch ) ] ( https://www.vn.nl/socioloog-hochschild-trump-stemmers-zijn-niet-gek/ ) that might give some insight into the reasons behind people voting the way they did . 
   i think the main problem with rise in hate against middle eastern refugees is that negative reports get censored out of the media like in germany and uk . 
  and that middle eastern refugees are held to a different standard than the rest of the population . 
  if a middle eastern refugee attacks a gay person or sexually assaults a woman a lot of politicians and police are afraid to tackle the problem head on in fear of being called racist or intolerant . 
  in the netherlands we had refugee centers where there was violence towards gay refugees . 
  rather than punish the perpetrators they simply moved all the gay refugees to a different location . 
  basicly seggrerating the population rather than making sure they understand that they need to adjust to our values . 
  this !, 
  i thought it was a really dumb way to handle the problem . 
  as for me personally , i 've had no interaction with refugees whatsoever , though we have a refugee centre in the city . 
  i 've seen a few walking around near the place , but it seems they do n't go far from there . 
  i 've never seen them in the city centre or other neighbourhoods . 
  but an airport shuttle should really be a standard , anywhere , right ? 
  even at a remote airfield in australia there 's often some sort of public transportation available ( maybe a guy in a car or something , but still ) . 
  so i 've never actually been to the usa , but this is ( as was the question ) what i * think * is stupid , in random order : * the huge prison population * death penalty * prison sentence for drugs possession ( addicts going to jail instead of rehab , what 's the end-goal of that ? ) . 
  * more emphasis on punishment than prevention . 
  * no/little social security , ( mental ) health care , etc. 
  i 've seen people having to crowdfund their cancer treatment/expensive operation more than once . 
  wtf ?!, 
  * driving age at 16 , with minimal ( none in some states ? ), 
  training . 
  * drinking age at 21 seems a bit silly when you 're by all other accounts an adult at 18 . 
  you can ( in some places or everywhere ? ), 
  buy a gun in a shop around the corner without much ( if any ? ), 
  permit requirements . 
  * the overzealous patriotism . 
  american flags everywhere . 
  * obsession with big cars . 
  * fast-food culture . 
  buckets of soda with free refills . 
  why ?!, 
  * widespread christian extremism . 
  this probably is n't actually the case , but media makes it seem like half the country is essentially isis-level crazy . 
  * the whole presidential election circus . 
  * the ( de-facto ) two party system . 
  * your measuring system . 
  * pennies ( the metal is worth more than the coin ) . 
  * tipping culture . 
  * requirement to go to very expensive private schools to get a decent education . 
  not sure if this is actually the case , though most ( all ? ), 
  big universities seem private . 
  * the whole idea of being the `` land of the free '' , and the implications of this . 
  * your obsession over `` race '' . 
  phew , that 's quite a list . 
  this does n't mean i do n't like the usa , it 's just that i think it has some really stupid things . 
  i 'd still like to visit some time !, 
  does n't work :(, 
  the milkman used to bring them . 
  i think you can still buy those in small/rural supermarkets . 
  not sure though , i have n't been in a small supermarket for ages . 
  any jobs in [ coffee shops ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coffeeshop_ ( netherlands ) \\ ) i guess . 
  though now that pot is getting legalized in other places it 's not that unique any more ... edit : reddit does n't understand the link : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coffeeshop_ ( netherlands ), 
  * we need to get rid of coal and gas quickly . 
  nuclear is really not a bad idea as an intermediary until we can get actually run on solar/wind ( or fusion ) . 
  * drugs should be decriminalized , and instead be regulated , with proper dosage and health information . 
  * young people should n't pay for old people 's pensions . 
  that money should instead be spent on education . 
  a young generation does n't owe the older generation anything , and to be born with a moral debt to your elders is ridiculous . 
  i 'm not sure what the polls on this are , though there are some very loud people disagreeing with these : * the law that makes organ donation default was actually a good thing . 
  * i do n't see what the problem with the trade deal with canada is all about . 
  we 've had deals like this since ww2 , why is it now a problem ? 
  * zwarte piet is pretty racist . 
  i 'm not greek , but coffee and a cigarette is basically my breakfast . 
  the tallest building in where i live ( in [ leeuwarden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leeuwarden ) ) is the [ achmeatoren ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/achmeatoren_willemskade.jpg ) at 115m . 
  2 x 50 cent , 1 from germany and 1 from belgium ( from 1999 ?! ), 
  and 1 x 20 cent from cyprus , surprisingly, 
  the germans once wanted this , and the dutch can probably do it so ... 
  this would at least insure no more refugees drown . 
  what does a name matter ? 
  there are more , better , ways to id someone . 
  fingerprints , as a simple start , but i can also think of dental , retina and dna and probably more . 
  first sip of wine when i was around eight or so , and wanted to taste it . 
  it burned in my throat and i did n't like it . 
  first time drinking on my own was at a party with my cousin when i was around 12 . 
  i had a one or two beers and got a little tipsy . 
  first time i got really drunk was at a friend 's 16th birthday . 
  i had just turned 14 and downed a few beers and half a bottle of run . 
  i think most eu countries have a ( largely ) automated online system where the government already has all the info and you just need to verify it . 
  it 's only in a few scenarios that you need to actually fill in anything yourself , such as having significant ( overseas ) assets , complicated fiscal partners , or being self employed . 
  i used to do it myself before , but now that i 'm co-owner of a small company , we have an accountant that does the books for us as well as my personal taxes since my situation is now a bit complicated . 
  thanks !, 
  :d we had thought of doing an expansion , but due to the way it 's made ( thanks to our inexperience making games ) , adding anything other than `` more of the same '' would be a huge amount of work . 
  so instead we decided we 'd focus on a new title for now , and improve our skills . 
  perhaps in the future we could do a sequel or something with all the cool stuff people came up with , but that 's for another time ... 
  we released our first game , [ convoy ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/318230 ) , in april 2015 .
