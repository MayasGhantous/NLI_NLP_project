  we 're now working on a new project set to release somewhere in 2017-early 2018, 
  2014 : roughly - $ 20k 2015 : roughly $ 60k 2016 : probably about $ 20k 2017 : probably nothing 2018 : hopefully a lot alas , that 's the life of an indie game developer , 
  as a frisian myself , i do n't think our dutch dialect is actually all that strong compared to , say the dialect spoken in the provinces of groningen or limburg . 
  i suppose that is because children here actually learn frisian as well ( and is often the dominant language in the rural areas , also with it 's own frisian dialects , believe it or not !, 
  ) , and when learning/speaking dutch it 's relatively close to the proper `` abn '' dutch . 
  in the netherlands , [ king willem-alexander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/willem-alexander_of_the_netherlands ) is the head of state technically has some political power . 
  he has to sign new laws and ( technically , since it never happens ) has the power to veto/block them . 
  he is in much the same way also responsible for approving a new government after elections . 
  besides this , the king essentially an ambassador for our country and regularly goes to other nations to improve trade relations , etc. 
  before becoming king , he had various ceremonial functions , and was member of the international olympic committee . 
  he was also in the royal netherlands navy , though i do n't believe he was ever actually part in any deployment . 
  as for other nobles , the other prince and princesses ( direct family of the king ) have various high-ranking functions within public and private sectors , as well as occasional ceremonial duties . 
  lower ranking nobles are rarely heard of in public , and i do n't know much about them . 
  i believe some families hold various estates and other assets . 
  i suspect they mostly do whatever other wealthy people do . 
  i believe there are also some nobles in direct service of the king , where they presumably help with certain ceremonial duties . 
  i ca n't really think of any super patriotic songs either . 
  we do of course have the [ national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mza2szxjfxm ) , as well as the * terrible * [ `` koningslied '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meukykb4g6k ) that everyone wants to forget about ( it was made for our king a few years ago when he became king , and everyone hated it ) . 
  and of we have the provincial ones , of which the [ frisian anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi8n8wauv4e ) is the most important . 
   i know there are also some less serious frisian patriotic songs by small/local artists , and i guess there are also those for the other provinces . 
  i run my own business . 
  i love what i do and often consider my work to be an extension of a hobby . 
  occasionally , when things get really busy , i do over 50 hours a week . 
  but normally i keep it below 40 , and actually ( try to ) spend some time doing other stuff i also enjoy . 
  regular 50 + hour work weeks sound horrible . 
  when do you have time for other things ? 
  i totally agree with this . 
  the uk needs the eu , the eu needs the uk . 
  but , with scotland and the rest of the uk in political troubles with each other , i do wonder how much political influence the uk actually still has in the eu as a single country , compared to other countries with big populations ( like italy , spain or even poland ) . 
  i wonder if perhaps another country will rise as a 3rd player to compliment/counter the current germany/france power block . 
  though perhaps the whole idea of countries leading the eu is/should be an idea of the past . 
  us being unified and all , is it perhaps time for international political parties to rise up and control the eu , instead of just the largest parties in a single country ? 
  this to me always felt a little strange . 
  we 're supposed to be unified without any borders , but still we can only vote for a party in our own country that has ( often ) existed before the start of the eu . 
  why ca n't i vote for a party that gets to rule over a bit of land 50km away from me , just because it is separated by supposedly non-existent borders ? 
  dutch universities normally require a high school diploma for dutch students . 
  and to get a high school diploma , your grades need to be high enough and you need to pass a national exam . 
  i have no idea how this works for foreign students , as i suppose the canadian high school system is very different from the dutch . 
  not sure about scholarships . 
  there is something called the [ erasmus scholarship ] ( http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/funding/scholarships_students_academics_en.php ) ( my sister is studying a year in the uk and has this ) , but i do n't know if this is limited to eu citizens only . 
  ( but since you have an italian citizenship , you 're an eu citizen , right ? ), 
  from what i can gather , there may be some issues with public transport in hungary around some south/eastern border towns , but i would n't really expect any problems otherwise . 
  nl and be not legal . 
  fines are between $ 50 and $ 200 i believe . 
  but as long as you do it somewhere out of sight , the chances of getting caught are fairly low . 
  in nl and be there 's also a thing called `` paalcamping '' , which are very small , free , campsites you 're allowed to stay at for 24h , with little/no utitlities . 
  there are a few spread out throughout the country but you probably wo n't find them if you did n't know where they are . 
  [ here ] ( http://wildkamperen.nl/wiki/paalkampeerterrein ) is a list with gps coordinates . 
  yeah , just get a normal european car . 
  this thing will be expensive as hell and ( in my opinion ) you 'll look like an idiot . 
  besides you wo n't be able to park it anywhere as roads and city centres really are n't made for monster trucks over here . 
  i 'm not sure you 're even allowed to drive one of those without a truck driving license . 
  you want to visit 9 cities in 15 days , this imo is quite a lot . 
  if you do a round trip you 're looking at over 4000km ( which equals a minimum of 42 hours driving . 
  this is without traffic , finding your way or any stops in between . ), 
  i 've done several road trips in my life , and while i think it may be possible to do in just 15 days , you wo n't see much of the places you visit ( not any attractions anyway ) . 
  for reference , on my longest ( distance ) road trip i spent around 2 weeks going from melbourne to darwin ( which is only 3700km ) , stopping only at 3 major attractions for a day , and several smaller ones for a short time . 
  you 're looking at more distance , more stops and much more busy roads ... 
  i think you should reconsider the road trip idea if you want to actually enjoy some of the places you visit . 
  perhaps cut the whole plan down to 3-4 places you want to see ? 
  for example , i think there is probably enough stuff to see in italy alone to spend 2 weeks travelling there . 
  you can always visit other countries another time  if you really do want to see all those places you should probably try to take a train . 
  last minute plane tickets can be cheap but also very expensive . 
  if you want a better chance at a cheap option you 'll probably have to book a few days ahead . 
  trains can ( as far as i know , but these systems are different in each country ) be booked at the station itself at the very last minute . 
  i think there are also some options available that allow you to travel long distances through several countries on a night train , saving you precious time by travelling while sleeping in a comfy ( ?? ), 
  true , but as long as you do n't plan on moving to some ( remote ) rural area there should be plenty around . 
  in the netherlands especially you can probably commute to work no matter where you live . 
  i do n't know if you realize this , but you can cross the country by car in about 4 hours . 
  so even if you live in some rural village you 're still close to major cities . 
  i agree , i think the netherlands would probably be a good choice . 
  english should get you around everywhere ( this may be more of an issue in other non-nordic countries ) . 
  depending on what you do in finance , getting a job should probably work fine , though i do n't really know much about the sector . 
  as for education , you 'll probably need some basic dutch skill if you 're looking to teach kids . 
  i remember in high school we had a polish maths teacher , a german philosophy and german teacher and an israeli english teacher . 
  they all knew basic dutch and there was n't really any trouble following their classes . 
  later in college we had an italian teacher who did n't speak dutch at all and only basic english . 
  this was fine too .

  since they 're not eu , i 'd expect there will be a lot more paper work when you buy something in turkey , which may not be worth the time/effort/money . 
  i do n't really know that much about buying cars in any of those countries but i expect it 's pretty much the same as anywhere else . 
  you just need to find the right place/car i suppose . 
  if you want something really special , go for something old that 's not seen much in the uk . 
  have you also considered soviet stuff like ladas , ( old ) skodas , etc ? 
  you may be able to find something cool in eastern europe if that 's your thing . 
  if you bring it from home , sure . 
  otherwise in a cafeteria it may be between $ 2-5 for a bowl of soup and a sandwich . 
  i used to work at a place that served an all-you-can-eat lunch for $ 30/month , which was totally worth it !, 
  i 've never done any hiking in the netherlands , strangely enough ( i 'll be going to belgium this summer ) , but these might be of help ( all in dutch ) : [ natuurmonumenten ] ( https://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/routes/overzicht?f[0]=im_field_route_type%3a15&amp;f[1]=im_field_provincie%3a1106 ) [ landschap noord holland ] ( http://www.landschapnoordholland.nl/natuurgebieden/interactieve-kaart ) [ general hiking site ] ( http://wandelnet.nl/route-zoeker?city=amsterdam&amp;min_distance=5&amp;max_distance=30&amp;type=0&amp;form_build_id=form-4519315917cb5ea0c70d2bef03a39343&amp;form_id=mod_wandelnet_routes_route_search_filter_form&amp;op= ) edit : obviously you 're not going to find any mountains in the netherlands , but between all the towns and urban areas , the dutch countryside can be quite pretty . 
  especially in the northern part which is incredibly flat , but also kind of unique and quite nice . 
  alternatively , you can also go for a bicycle ride if that 's your thing . 
  there are many nice routes ( also on the sites above ) and that way you may get to see a bit more of the land . 
  edit 2 : note that camping in the wild is not allowed !, 
  there may be some free camp sites on your chosen route , but you 'd have to ask about that at a local tourist office . 
  i think this is the exact same for the netherlands , except for # 3 . 
  i do n't think we have any kind of guild system like this , but your canadian qualifications as an electrician may not be valid in the netherlands . 
  aside from that , from what i hear , the construction industry is pretty rough right now , and getting jobs is hard . 
  a trend nowdays is that individual workers contract themselves out to other companies or individual clients , similar to freelance work . 
  i 'm not in the trade myself , but from friends i hear this is n't a great development as you 'll be more stressed for work , always on the lookout for a new project . 
  that , and you 'll likely lose some social benefits like cheap ( er ) insurance , pension , etc.
