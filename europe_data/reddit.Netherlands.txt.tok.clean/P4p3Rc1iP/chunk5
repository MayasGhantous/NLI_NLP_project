  about esl teachers in the netherlands , it 's very small market . 
  most people speak english pretty well and everyone learns it in school . 
  though i suppose you may be able to get teaching certifications and actually teach in schools relatively easily . 
  and as for making the equivalent of 110k anually ? 
  i honestly have no idea , but i highly doubt it . 
  it would be around 70k euros , but i 'm not sure what the cost of living in canada is . 
  i doubt it 's much higher than in the netherlands , and you 're not going to make 70k euros as an electrician , probably more like around 30k anually ... 
  generally , taxis are very expensive . 
  in my experience , in general , the cheapest way is to stay in a hotel/hostel near the city centre ( but not quite in the centre ) and use public transport or just walk for a few minutes . 
  i get the impression that , in the netherlands , the older generations expect people to work for the same employer employer for the rest of their life . 
  i ca n't ever see myself getting more than a 1-2 year contract because employers do n't ever seem to do permanent contracts any more . 
  how is that in your country ? 
  a lot of people escape death in texas every day considering the amount of guns over there ... on a more serious note , yeah , it 's bad that it happened but what exactly is your point ? 
  and i never said there was an economic boom ( though i seem to be doing pretty well for myself ) , but i do n't know anyone who has trouble finding work either . 
  sure , it may not always be their dream jobs , but we can really only have that many `` communications experts '' , economic crisis or not . 
  this is in leeuwarden by the way , i can imagine the countryside may lag a little behind . 
  though with the recent rearrangements of municipalities , the ones who were bankrupt ( mostly due to bad investments which cost a lot of money when land prices did n't go as they hoped they would in boarnsterhim for example ) now also seem to be reaping the benefits . 
  `` oh noes , another shocking thing by wilders , those muslims must really hate us now !, 
  quick , vote for wilders before the terrorists come to `` allahakbar '' themselves against our perfect way of life ! '', 
  / s i 've been getting the feeling that less and less people take wilders seriously . 
  aside from flat out calling for the extermination of muslims , there are n't that many `` shocking '' things left for him to say to get some attention . 
  the economic crisis is over , unemployment is going down , and less people are looking a scapegoat . 
  funny/sad how the maps shows a local difference in the dutch `` r '' , yet completely omits the frisian language in which the `` y '' is very common . 
  oh , a dress code for a white collar job ? 
  how wrong !, 
  let 's all go to work naked tomorrow . 
  everyone . 
  that 'll show the muslims who 's the dominant culture in this land !, 
  oh come on !, 
  do you really want to make every single fucking thing about migrants/refugees/muslims ? 
  hema has been selling those eggs for years , along with the god blessed good christian easter eggs . 
  same goes for the `` happy spring '' marketing campaign , because it 's a campaign for spring , not just the easter holidays . 
  but for some reason it 's suddenly a problem and you want to act like you 've read the bible and believe those muslim heathens come to threaten your beloved holiday ? 
  this sounds somewhat similar to the dutch `` belegeren '' meaning '' ( to ) siege '' . 
  the dutch word for `` army '' is `` leger '' , or `` krijgsmacht '' ( though krijgsmacht refers more to the national defence force as a whole , not a single army ) . 
  yeah , i was going to say this . 
  most parents keep the doors on `` child lock '' until their children are old enough and have been taught to watch out before opening the door . 
  this was never an explicit part of my driving course/test . 
  it 's just common sense . 
  the largest opponents of this law 's biggest argument against it is that extra money should be spent towards the well being of depressed elders , instead of having them kill themselves and saving some money . 
  he meant : tbh , i 've seen [ people shouting falsehoods and spreading fear and the people following them without thinking ] on all sides of the political spectrum ... 
  america and uk won ww2 , america `` won '' the cold war , america brought `` freedom '' to the world . 
  i 'd say american culture spread as a result of wars . 
  why not ? 
  just wondering . 
  apple killed the finish economy . 
  nokia could n't compete with the iphone , the paper industry died due to the ipad . 
  indonesia was the dutch one . 
  we lost it to the japanese in ww2 . 
  after ww2 , when we got it back , the people wanted independence . 
  we smashed the uprising down and committed some war crimes , then america came and basically told us to gtfo or there 'd be no marshal plan for us . 
  well , you need to see the road in order to avoid all the potholes i suppose ... 
  ah yeah , i was in czech a few years ago and remember some shitty roads . 
  still , it also had a few nice ( newly built through eu programs ) ones . 
  but for some reason , in the capital of the eu , there seem to be no nice roads whatsoever . 
  went to poland recently , can confirm . 
  no wait , poland actually has one really nice road , straight from berlin to warsaw . 
  all the roads that lead to brussels are equally shitty . 
  you 're just kicking the words of / u/professionalwil around as if he said something wrong , but you do n't present your own views . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  caps lock is no longer cruise control for cool . 
  kind of . 
  apparently you have to remove the centre of the bulb as it is poisonous and properly cook the rest . 
  they do n't taste very good though , kinda bitter ( arsenic i guess ? ), 
  and starchy according to my grandmother . 
  but it keeps you alive if there 's nothing else ... 
  the biggest party gets to try to form a coalition first . 
  if that fails , the party in second place gets to try . 
  if that fails , the third . 
  it may take a while , but there will be a coalition eventually . 
  the modern architecture is because the city was [ mostly destroyed during ww2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotterdam_blitz ), 
  maybe . 
  still , nearly 1/3rd of the world clearly does n't share that opinion . 
  respect for another person 's culture , whether you agree with it or not , is something i hope one day all people can do . 
  nobody has ever changed their opinion by being insulted for having the opinion . 
  [ screaming and shouting how `` they '' are wrong does n't work . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re3j_rhkqjc ), 
  wait , so you 're saying those [ 1.6 billion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_religious_populations#adherent_estimates_in_2012 ) people are all deserving of the same vitriol current day nazis are receiving ? 
  why ? 
  about [ 20,000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_islamist_terrorist_attacks ) ( rough estimate , hard to quickly count all from that list ) people got killed in islamist terrorist attacks over the last 40 years . 
  that 's a factor of 1 death/80000 muslims . 
  over 40 years . 
  across the globe . 
  by this logic , you really should n't go outside any more as the average [ murder rate in your country is ( likely ) much higher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#by_country ) . 
  should 80000 ( yes , eighty thousand ) people feel personally responsible for the death of 1 individual , just because they share a religion with the person who killed them ? 
  through that reasoning , whatever your religion is , you , and 80000 of your fellow believers , should personally feel responsible whenever someone else sharing your religion kills someone else . 
  i really do n't understand why people are so afraid of islam . 
  something something salty tears . 
  they 're called [ seeblatt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seeblatt ) , also found on the frisian flag !, 
  [ lies !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akw-eakclbe ), 
  what ?!, 
  since when ? 
  it must be be ** taught ** !, 
   but this is what i believe and i ca n't really change that the one truth on the internet . 
  i thought we left that kind of justice in the 20th century ... 
  agreed , and along with this , i think that in principle referenda go against the idea of a representational democracy . 
  the people elect politicians who 's job it st to be professional politicians . 
  you ca n't have every citizen in a country be a professional politician as well . 
  so if we have a referendum for every important decision , what the hell are the politicians supposed to be doing ?
