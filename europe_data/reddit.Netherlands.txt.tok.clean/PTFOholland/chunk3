  this threat lacks nuance, 
  hey , someone got it !, 
  everybody sees it as an extreme , but forget we 're only voting of 5 % of the treaty , everything that is n't trade . 
  that 's not the campaign poster , i know because i have 5000 neutral flyers . 
  everyone i talk to does n't mention the eu but expresses doubts about a future membership and the ukraine shifting west . 
  also a lot of people care about the corruption , poroschenko and animal welfare, 
  i like how you use two guys behind the hundreds of people behind this as the only true motivation behind the referendum . 
  you make it easy to shed it in a baf light for people not from the netherlands . 
  absolutely disgusting show of propaganda, 
  both norway and iceland seem to be doing a lot better than us , 
   bj\u00f6rt framt\u00ed\u00f0  the party supports iceland joining the european union and the euro . 
  go out and protest tomorrow , you'all only got 300.000 people so it 's quicker to unite i hope . 
  get that pirate party in , yarrr, 
  i expected worse . 
  i fully know this is terrible , but we had a 4 % decrease in the netherlands a few years back ... without any boycots . 
  that 's impressive . . ? 
  we boycot the shit out of them and they only manage a 4 % shrunk . 
  not too bad . 
  taking full and timely advantage of all diplomatic and military channels between the parties , including appropriate contacts in third countries and within the united nations , the osce and other international fora regular meetings both at the level of high officials and of experts of the military institutions of the parties ; conflict prevention , crisis management and military-technological cooperation 1 . 
  the parties shall enhance practical cooperation in conflict prevention and crisis management , in particular with a view to increasing the participation of ukraine in eu-led civilian and military crisis management operations as well as relevant exercises and training activities , including those carried out in the framework of the common security and defence policy ( csdp ) .

  you 're stating it as a fact though , which is not a nice way to go about spreading lies . 
  time and time again have movements been branded ` stupid , pointless or ridicilous ' meanwhile millions of people will vote no , you really think they all have ` no idea ' ? 
  we will see , but right now we 're storming upon a giant victory for ** no ** . 
  why are you shooting him down like that ? 
  he said ** possibility ** of joining eu , he 's right at that , go and read the 400 + page treaty again mate . 
  visa free travel will be put in place as well , ** with ** added laws to increase this further , again read the treaty . 
  and the treaty does include trade , especially with regards to the meat industry , the party for animals ( yes we have one . . ) has been flipping their shit about this , and quite understandable . 
  putin will not ` walk over us ' are you insane ? 
  you think he will attack countries with nukes ? 
  look , i know you 're from finland which has issues with them and understandable , but you really think that without the treaty we basically write a surrender to russia ? 
  wake up , ukraine has always been under russia 's influence and even been part of their borders for years . 
  you think we breaking down the door and saying ; you are ours now !!!, 
  will go well with their people ? 
  i do n't think so , look at the fucking war being fought . 
  ah well , right now the polls are gaining fast in the no front , so i can better be used on the streets again unlike the internet , this association treaty wo n't be signed by the netherlands if the people have their say in this , and we will , with this referendum on april 6th . 
  you might want to read a bit further , this has been said time and time again by the yes front . 
  a yes vote does n't mean you oppose putin , and a no vote does n't mean you support putin . 
  this treaty is about ukraine , and the arguments for no are boiled down to this : not getting involved in an active war with military aid . 
  no visa-free travel between the eu and ukraine no financial aid to fight corruption ( look at every corrupt country ever , giving them money will only lead to more corruption and ... ukraine is the most corrupt country in europe . ), 
  animal rights . 
  they are very very dated compared to the eu if you look at ukraine . 
  this is also why the party for animals has been campaigning a no , because we would get the famous ` plofkip ' and other bs like that into the eu . 
  yes vote : grow the eu 's sphere if influence over ukraine and push our borders further to russia fight corruption bring more human rights ( also include lgbt ) trade , which is good , but we do n't really need an entire association treaty for this . 
  a trade agreement would be a lot wiser . 
  source ? 
  i 've been campaigning for days now and almost no one says this , they all are actually quite informed , even about the military stuff , visa-free travel and financial support . 
  thanks , but no thanks . 
  meanwhile the no front is growing :'), 
  i saw d66 campaigning today and mentioning trade , freedom and gay rights . 
  no mention of militairy aid , visa free travel with a country in an active war etc. . or this . 
  great !, 
  more reason to vote no in the dutch ukraine referendum, 
  murderer !, 
  that 's cheap . 
  in norway i once had some nice bread and egg from a supermarket for 10 $ was delicious but damn expensive that country . 
  will check my dutch eggs when i het home, 
  swiss south should also be included as that 's the only time ever i 've been stopped at a border post . 
  the police officer saw my swiss flag attached to my antenna and told me to go trough tho . 
  i heard they do n't like white people . 
  yes . . 
  restoring our empire !, 
  next up , indonesia , i am sure wilders would love it with so many muslims !, 
  any non eurosceptic should look at juncker, 
  not if we have anything to say about that . . you know , democracy . 
  we also got an angry guy from lebanon with a tv crew simply putting on wheel locks . 
  you okay in the head ? 
  i said rich oil countries . 
  you know , the same countries directly funding the situation in iraq and syria . 
  bahrain , saudia arabia , united emirates etc. 
  edit : did n't see your second question . 
  i would n't spend the next few years in a foreign country . 
  as soon as it will seem safe ill get my family and move back in to rebuild my country , like we did after the war . 
  we have been building our countries for centuries , and they come in , fly their family in , live on wellfare and keep living here , basically without having done anything for us and only creating wars by believing in a thousand year old fairy tale . 
  yet they come all the way across countries with no war to a magical place called germoney . 
  meanwhile , the rich as fuck oil states do n't do shit . 
  it 's so depressing , everyone is still thinking they are only helping good people , and there are no rotten apples . 
  just like when they voted that nice guy into office a few years ago . 
  no , not at all . 
  but the netherlands have a big history with far left framing the far right . 
  for instance in the asylum seeker locations , they keep sending their people over and acting like retards ( you can spot the same guy despertatly trying to get in front of a camera , who is all over the netherlands apparantly ) and do n't forget pim fortuyn who was murdered by an extreme leftist . 
  99 % sure leftists framing far right . . again . 
  he 's actually coming here for the referendum about the association treaty with ukraine . 
  i doubt anyone will listen to him about anti eu, 
  ah here comes ukraine 's answer to everything again . . 
  corruption ? 
  i wonder if mark rutte is next . 
  he 's either asexual or homo sexual , he should just tell the world !, 
  or we keep believing he 's the 40 year old virgin , 
  it 's easy being an ukrainian is n't it ? 
  bad weather ? 
  blame putin . 
  dutch citizens fighting for democracy and calling a referendum ? 
  putin !, 
  thanks for sources !, 
  right sector , radical party and people fighting on the front line of azov, 
  thanks , currently campaigning for a high voter turnout , looks like most will be voting no , i am however stating both good and bad so people can make up their own minds edit : no campaigning on reddit as my own opinion is a big no , 
  we do n't want russia or ukraine .
