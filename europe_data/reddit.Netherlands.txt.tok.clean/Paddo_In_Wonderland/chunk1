but they were n't married here , of course . 
  they were on a vacation !, 
  no no ... of course not , _ they 're married _ !, 
   such as a child being born to the couple or the girl being pregnant . 
  * 1 ) get married in secret * 2 ) get pregnant * 3 ) win ? 
  i think this is going to work the other way than it is intended . 
  wealth in the eu is spread over the population way better than it is in the us . 
  also , come to think of it , we 're happier with less money . 
  i think being happy , having good healthcare and being less zealous about their nation 's greatness , is more important than being a total dick . 
  it gets smuggled into europe from morocco through gibraltar . 
  do a kickstarter for renovation . 
  if that 's the thing , then 30 % is n't representative . 
  we vote every couple of years for a parliament . 
  a referendum just makes it seem we do n't even trust our own vote for them to do their job . 
  sad to say , but an earthquake never comes alone . 
  be aware a third and possibly even a fourth earthquake may be coming . 
  you 're always welcome in an union with the netherlands . 
  i know . 
  it 's just silly to switch units when you 're comparing . 
  you 're messing up your units here . 
  from one seat to 40 % ? 
  40 % of what , one seat ? 
  this is the equivalent to saying * from one potato to 40 carrots . 
  even the netherlands has a larger economy . 
  http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/rus/ http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/nld/, 
  its economy is in shambles and has no diversity whatsoever to trade . 
  russia is the very definition of a modern day [ banana republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_republic ) . 
  i expect it to go up for the netherlands the coming years. , as student housing gets more expensive and our student assist changed into a loan . 
  the rus were dominated by the vikings , big difference . 
  erdogan is learning some tricks from putin here . 
  orange is our national colours because the royal family is orange-nassau . 
  which has it 's origins in [ orange , france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_orange ) where oranges were cultivated . 
  that is if i remember history class well enough . 
  it 's all about greenwich . 
  yeah , i 'm not even continuing this argument . 
  i will not reply to rhetoric . 
  those who control the past , control the future . 
  this is some real life example of orwellianism . 
  capital punishment gives no more protection from criminals than a life-long sentence in prison . 
  the ironic part is that it 's okay to decide whether someone else may or may not life , but it 's not up to an individual to decide whether they may or not life . 
  neither this is about euthanasia , but about assisted suicide . 
  euthanasia only relates to assisted suicide in case of physical pain and suffering . 
  this is kind of ironic coming from someone who lives in a nation where the death penalty is still a common practice . 
  not saying you are pro-death penalty or anything , but it at least skews the opinion about it . 
  ah , the gleiwitz incident [ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ) . 
  that was staged by the nazis . 
  i wish we had these kind of holidays . 
  it 's not that multiculturism does n't work . 
  it 's the islam and multiculturism do n't combine . 
  somehow poles , germans and dutch people are living happily in this neighbourhood , but we never see the muslims from any country here during neighbourhood parties . 
  that 's the gist about russian propaganda . 
  everyone who does not agree is either a fascist , nazi , isis supporter or general * they 're out to get russia * . 
  russia is just good ol' soviet paranoid . 
  they are not calling him hitler , they are comparing his actions with that of hitler . 
  that 's a very big nuance . 
  whataboutism and bigotry . 
  the nordic countries , and most european countries , have a mixed economy . 
  where some things are owned by the state , besides that , a form a regulated capitalism has the means of production . 
  i think those people have no idea what real socialism is about . 
  i 'll give them a hint : they 're the countries that rank the highest in gdp and happiness . 
  it 's mainly the far-right and those who are unhappy about europe that cling to russia and their propaganda train . 
  thank you for showing your colors . 
  i will end this conversation as it will end up being useless . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're aware , but the brexit was mainly over the refugee issue and the friction between european countries because of this . 
  this is , as a cause , the result of the syrian civil war and the is insurgency in iraq and syria . 
  the fact that you do n't even realize this makes me cringe a little bit . 
  also , i 'm not sure if you 're aware of the russian-us relations , but that 's pretty shaky at the moment as well , especially over syria and ukraine . 
  in geopolitical sense , which is a hideous remnant of the cold war , europe is being threatened by russia . 
  the us ca n't fathom to lose influence in the europe for a major deal of economic and political reasons as well as security reasons . 
  the last thing the us wants is an unstable europe . 
  they wo n't fuel that if they can help it . 
  russia 's finest export product . 
  it appears to have the [ same origin ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reconstruction:proto-germanic/sahs%c4%85 ) , nice catch !, 
  i love it how * sax * is the remainder of the name of the people who used live there : the saxons . 
  the saxons were famous for their typical sword , the [ * seax * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seax ) in old english . 
  i 'm living in the area where they call it a * knief * , however , it only remained in certain proverbs and only refers to small knives . 
   hungarian prosecutors have filed charges against a camerawoman accused of kicking and tripping refugees fleeing police near the southern border with serbia last year . 
   petra laszlo was fired from her job at n1tv , a television station with nationalist sympathies , after video footage spread online appearing to show her kicking a girl and a young man . 
   her prosecution for disorderly conduct comes as political tensions mount over europe 's migration crisis in the region . 
   hungary is holding a referendum on whether to accept eu migrant quotas on 2 october , the same day as the far-right freedom party is standing in presidential elections in neighbouring austria . 
   prosecutors described how hundreds of migrants broke through a police cordon and out of a holding area and headed towards szeged , a nearby city , in september last year . 
  laszlo was directly behind the police officers and filmed migrants as they ran . 
   `` while filming she kicked a young man in the shin with a swift kick of the sole of her right foot , and also kicked young girl around the knee with her right foot , '' the prosecutors said in a statement . 
   there was no evidence of a racially motivated hate crime , they added . 
   laszlo was not immediately reachable for comment . 
  last year she told the daily magyar nemzet that she felt remorse over what had happened . 
   `` i am practically in shock from what i did , and what was done to me , '' laszlo said . 
  `` i am not heartless [ or ] racist ... i am a woman , a mother of small children , who has since lost her job , and who made a bad decision in panic . ''  prosecutors said she had not kicked a man carrying a small child , one of the accusations she had faced during last year 's online furore . 
   `` [ laszlo ] kicked toward a man carrying a child in his hands , but the kick did not reach the man . 
  the man carrying the child still fell , because ... one of the policemen tried to catch and restrain him , and he lost his balance as he broke free . ''  the man , a football coach named osama abdul mohsen , went on to spain where a sports school offered to find him work . 
  i has argument for you : potato !, 
  see , i make joke !, 
  hahaha, 
  although i do n't oppose any form of right to self-determination , there 's also the consideration of a ` wise ' choice . 
  maybe not economically in this case , but political . 
  do we really want an unstable iberia ? 
  unless the political part with spain is being solved , i do n't think it 's a wise choice to pursue it any further . 
  error : undefined, 
  haha , just what i was thinking as well . 
  happy cake day !,
