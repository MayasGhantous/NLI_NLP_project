  i find it reasonable that most of my rights to privacy end at the moment i step out of my house , but on my own private property it should be absolute . 
  it 's * my place * , the government got little business in sniffing around there in the first place , whether visibly or invisibly . 
  sure , that is known . 
  but there 's a difference in equating london with the entirety of europe altogether . 
  no idea why people downvote me for that , as i 'm fully justified in doubting that comment in the first place . 
  not to mention that camera surveillance is much less intrusive than the government sneaking into your pc or backyard at home ( your * real private space * ) , but as usual that argument will fall on deaf ears whenever an attack has taken place . 
  well meant question : should n't this be a local crime story ? 
  interesting to read , but stuff like this happens on a monthly basis in the netherlands nowadays . 
  do n't know if it 's that different for spain though . 
  i consider that to be less intrusive as it happens in the public domain : it does n't hit the private sphere of people directly . 
  i 'm a bit surprised by the way that the major cities in the us - according to you - are n't on the same level in terms of cameras and surveillance as in the us . 
  are you sure about this ? 
  i can not imagine new york for example to be less secure than say amsterdam . 
  ** edit : ** if you disagree at least do me the honour of giving a proper response . 
  cameras and surveillance is much less intrusive than the govt sneaking in your backyard or your email , as that touches the thing we call ` privacy ' . 
  i know that it is n't a popular position these days - especially when emotions are high again like today - but the only thing that was claimed here is that camera surveillance is certainly not on the same level as the mass gathering of private data in that sense . 
  after all : it does not happen at home , that being your direct private domain . 
  yeah , just read about it . 
  great that the media reported it wrong - again . 
  it 's another reminder to wait for the authorities to confirm something before actually accepting the truth of something . 
  great journalism by the way : they properly vetted their sources it seems . 
  also @ / u/cblackout the hyperbole aside : what i am pointing out is that the powers that reside with the government in terms of security and information gathering are broader in the us than in europe , maybe even much broader . 
  we are n't waging a battle against encryption here in the way that is happening in the us , nor do we by default think that ` security ' always trumps other rights . 
  the infamous quote ` if you got nothing to hide , why bother ' has certainly lost its charm here . 
  you must always ask yourself whether you should allow the government to lay the infrastructure that could turn your country in a dictatorship overnight if possible : i 'd rather not lay the groundsworks for that , not to mention that it is self defeating . 
  before i 've reasoned that al qaida sort of scored a ( small ) victory on the us , as they in the end succeeded in changing the american way of life : they achieved that under their pressure things like privacy were curtailed , even to the point that it gets downright ridiculous . 
  i do n't want to give a fringe group exactly that in my country , or anywhere else in europe , as the long term consequences of that way of thinking are probably worse than the results nowadays . 
  do n't get me wrong though : the security services should be properly staffed and funded , but at some point information gathering should subside when we are actually achieving what the terrorists are aiming at : the curtailing of freedom . 
  my social contract with the government does n't extend so far that i want to give it a master key to all my encrypted traffic for example ( nor does it in the us at the moment , not yet ) nor should you strive for it to be like that in your country . 
   what morale boost ? 
  maybe the one where they catch a perpetrator alive and are able go bring him to justice ? 
  do n't act as if this is a small thing : if he would be on the run for the coming few months everyone would 've been complaining about the incompetence of the authorities again in a manner reminiscent of the disappearance of salah abdeslam . 
  again : by turning belgium into an orwellian paradise ? 
  the same orwellian paradise that can not guarantee in the end that these attacks will not occur anymore ? 
  what it is rather disgraceful about this article is the fingerpointing to the intelligence service , the very services that work ** under the rules set out by politicians ** . 
  they have to observe the law in the end : the fact that their tools are not sufficient in a legal , financial and general professional sense is not their fault . 
  of course all blame will be shifted to the people actually doing the dirty work - and not the lawmakers itself - and that is why this article deserves to be criticized . 
  there 's nothing wrong with critizing just about everything that went wrong in the belgian intelligence climate for the past years . 
  just know at who to direct it at first , instead of instantly blaming the security services for the fact that others underfunded and understaffed them . 
  quick response by the authorities : this is a much needed morale boost at this point . 
  i 'm rather impressed that they managed to catch him so quickly , but speed is key in situations like these . 
  too bad that he will be released at some point in the future though : i believe that belgium does n't know life imprisonment without parole , but someone with more extensive knowledge of the belgian judicial system feel free to step in and correct my assessment . 
  edit : he could be locked up for life it seems , glancing over belgian criminal law . 
  ** edit : ** there 's apparantly [ uncertainty about his arrest .

  honest question : what if you 've been living in europe all your life . 
  or for 20 + years ? 
  seems rather dishonest to deport those people , although i agree that those that value ideas that run opposite to what we find normal in europe should be corrected some way or another . 
  those with double passports could be deported in case of serious crimes inspired by such dangerous ideas ( religious extremism , honour killings , etc. 
  ) , but you would still need other nations to comply with that . 
  you may not like what / u/stop _ ttip said , but there 's something highly immoral in not distinguishing between perpetrators and actual innocents . 
  something tells me you are not interested in making that distinction , am i right ? 
  that is true , even though i still rather dislike the notion of europe having to be christian as of 2016 . 
  but you 're right as rain when saying that our legal systems ( and the mores in society ) are strongly based on christian principles , even though many people do not recognize it anymore today . 
  so , the appropriate time aside , we actually appear to agree . 
  i admit that it is an arbitrary assessment to wait a few days until you talk about future policy , but it 's not unusual in politics . 
  more broadly speaking it 's a moral thing : care about the victims first . 
  the same you could also see in the netherlands whenever a dead soldier would return from afghanistan for example : talking about the course of that mission was certainly not done directly after that happened . 
   the attacker in paris was clearly harboured and covered for by `` moderate muslims '' , this issue is n't just limited to the terrorists but the ones who passively support them . 
  of which a significant amount of the muslim population seem to be . 
  yeah that shit bothered the hell out of me as well . 
  how can you harbor a person guilty to the mass murder of ~ 130 people and still sleep at night ? 
  every moral person would call the police immediatly , even if it would be your father , mother , sister or brother . 
  the thought crossed my mind whether it was a cultural thing , which could be ( as moroccan society in the netherlands is also ' a closed one ' ) , but even then the moderate muslims ` in the know ' apparantly felt okay with letting that guy live there . 
  although i 'm still interested who tipped off the authorities in molenbeek , and how many people actually knew about his presence . 
   what do you expect though , people not to talk politically about an issue that killed a load of people ? 
  these kind of events have a massive political effect so it 's stupid to expect people to not talk about them politically . 
  i expect people to show some common decency and debate about it a few days ahead in the future , when everyone has calmed down and the victims have been identified . 
  naturally they want to talk about it , but i 'm mostly criticizing the author of the piece above in being dishonest about the quoted part as well . 
  furthermore i think in general it 's a good piece , but there are some flaws to it . 
  you can truly notice it here on reddit , but also on other news outlets : emotion rules the day again . 
  and even though i 'm all in favor of strict new policy , including the complete eradication of all traces of the ` integration ' approach in favor of assimilatory strategies , it just seems so damn unfitting to capitalize on the fears and anger of persons today . 
  it feels like the people killed today are just being used as tools to finally make a point - and the same pattern unfolded after both attacks in paris . 
  well the bodies are n't cold or people are already talking about the most bizarre measures to combat the grand issue of islamic extremism . 
  to criticize the opinion that was linked here : while by thursday nobody will be talking about the victims anymore , not many people are doing that as of right now . 
  everyone seems to exploit what happened here for political gain - and that strikes me as rather disgusting . 
  it was more meant as a convenient example , and therefore for comparison i used the denomination that i used to belong to . 
  i 'm roman catholic by birth like most people here in the southern provinces , that being north-brabant , limburg , and parts of gelderland . 
  but i 'm certainly not practicing in case you 're interested . 
  edit : you mind find this chart to be [ helpful ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/nederlandgodsdienst1849.png/250px-nederlandgodsdienst1849.png ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://uva-kaartenmakers.nl/_media/knip-aksant-2003_med_hr.jpeg ) one is more recent though . 
   and im not speaking for you , but you think you speak for the majority of europeans ? 
  i am not making assumptions about who thinks what without sufficient proof , nor do i claim to speak ` for the europeans ' . 
  you did n't say you spoke for the majority to start out with : that 's the part you casually inserted now to weaken what you said above . 
   muslims are running out of time , they got ta do something about their image problem and they got ta do it fast . 
  on that we actually agree , but only because people like to think that wahhabist ideas for example are widely shared among all streams within islam , which is a blatant lie . 
  but i wo n't go on about this before someone sees me as some kind of white knight for a religion i have no business with - and moreover one i rather strongly dislike . 
   this is what i meant when i said this is not a threat , you obviously did not understand it . 
   this is not a threat made by me to this guy it sure looked like it , especially with the ` not welcome ' part , enforced by ` europeans ' then apparantly . 
  you stayed rather ambigious about the solution if europeans according to you will no longer put up with it , and you might as well be clear in what ` would ' happen in that case . 
  what would the solution actually ** be ** in that case if i may ask ? 
   anti muslim sentiments are rising , and only muslims can change that , and if they dont things will get realy ugly for them realy fast . 
  they 've been strongly on the rise since 9/11 . 
  those of us old enough to directly remember the attacks and that have lived through the early 2000 's as ( young ) adults know as no other that the trend you are describing is just part of a continuum : something happens , and it flares up . 
  nothing happens and it goes down . 
  really , it is n't much different than those days . 
   and if you , ** the muslims ** dont solve them . 
  we the europeans will decide that islam is not welcome here anymore . 
  * the * muslim exists ? 
  sure , there are large similarities between the different streams within that religion , but if some christian cult in the us ( hypothethically speaking ) would kill a shitload of people in the name of jesus , i would shed all responsibility for it as a roman catholic .
