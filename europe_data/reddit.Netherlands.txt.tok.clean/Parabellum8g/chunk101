  everyone seems to forget that terms like ` islam ' and ` christianity ' are descriptive terms - not absolute definitions of a coherent , 100 % thinking-the-same unit of people . 
  he is not guilty to what happened in brussels , and you should get off your high horse . 
  and quite frankly : you do n't speak for europe , and certainly not for me . 
  i think it 's rather arrogant to even start speaking about what ` we the europeans ' think when a great deal of people disagree with the garbage you just spewed out above . 
   i am not going to continue this conversation , because this is the beginning of me being dragged to a conversation about a lot of nonsense . 
  and nonsense that is irrelevant . 
   if one says a ton of nonsense and replies with more , then there 's nothing one can do . 
  it 's a fruitless conversation about irrelevant junk . 
  it takes a lot more to refute a nonsensical claim than to just make it . 
  that 's easy is n't it ? 
  just say the other position is just based on mostly nonsense and try to get away with it . 
  you wo n't get away though . 
   as for flaws with your arguments again it 's just a distraction , because like i said it does n't matter . 
  and it would be a big distraction because i find ** nearly everything ** about it wrong . 
  so it would be a huge distraction , debating something irrelevant . 
  proof , proof , ** proof ** . 
  you keep dodging the question : you refuse to answer me where you base this off - and repeating your previous position ( circular reasoning ) is n't going to cut it for me . 
  you might call discussions like these as arguments that boil down to death from exhaustion , but if you start to withdraw like this you are all but innocent in my eyes : it sounds like weakness , and that you doubt you can actually bring about true arguments against what i said . 
   in france last year in just one attack 130 died in just the november 25 attacks . 
  there were more though . 
  so if we were to normalise deaths per capita in lightning ( us ) vs terrorism ( eu ) then the second would be higher . 
  but of course this is taking eu as comparison . 
  if we were to take france then the idea that there were more deaths provoked by lightening in france than by terrorism is absurd . 
  how many deaths due to terror in 2014 ? 
  of course you wo n't say this because it is n't convenient . 
  but even if the actual numbers are about the same ( or even slightly higher , taking the london attacks and the madrid bombings into account ) , you still are sort of dodging what i said : the chance of being involved in this is slim at best . 
  that 's all i wanted to say by using ` being struck my lightning ' ( a popular example on the internet to show how small the chance for something is , but you know this ) : the odds of being entangled in a terrorist attack is something that should be of little concern to the average citizen . 
  guess what , we agree on something after all . 
   i find your reasoning completely flawed . 
  justification required . 
  i want to see arguments , a lot of them , especially on why it is a bad idea - according to you - to keep your head cool in situations like these . 
   again , i do n't agree with your classification of said opinions . 
  if you mean the fact that many people in general have opinions that are n't really thought through - and primarily based on raw emotions - well , then you are right . 
  if you meant that the people that react to it in another way than me are classified as ` irrational ' by me , then you are mistaken . 
  i just categorized those that react emotionally as being just that , not the people that disagree with me . 
  if it 's red , it 's red : there 's no point in denying what is . 
   you 're disregarding reality as unimportant . 
  this is just framing : nowhere can you justify this according to my comments above . 
  show me some reasonable proof if you come up with low attacks like these . 
  edit :  and it does n't surprise me that polish people rather live in a country where this does n't happen . 
  you sparked my curiosity . 
  do you happen to be polish ? 
   that 's been cast so firmly as a nazi position that even saying it out loud would get you attacked in the streets in some places in europe , that 's where were at now ( edited : corrected wrong quote ) well not in my country , even though it kinda borders on the political fringe . 
  i 'm not against it in principle , yet for now i am against it as i do n't see it as a valid solution ( see below ) . 
  to say it is framed as a ` nazi position ' is something i do n't recognize myself in , but maybe it 's different in other nations . 
   having said that , the only way to reduce terror attacks is have less muslims in europe . 
  the fist step to that is stopping mass immigration from islamic nations . 
  that 's the only way to protect innocent civilians in europe from these attacks . 
  it 's fine though , try and re-frame it so that anyone who makes anything close to this argument as a fascist jackbooted skinhead frothing at the mouth to kill brown people . 
  you will silence it in public , but not in peoples hearts . 
  in the end , ghetto-ization and failing integration policy , as well as a lack of commitment from immigrants from muslim countries to integrate , have fed these problems . 
  i never supported integration : i am all in favor of assimilation , but that will take time ( even with proper policy ) . 
  the damage however is already done : whether you stop the flow of newcomers from those nations will not solve existing problems , although it would prevent future problems if the current way we handle newcomers stays into existence . 
  therefore i think you are mostly arguing against integration , instead of islam in general . 
   but in the end no matter how much you silence people in public it 's still their decision who to vote for , and they will vote for whoever runs on this , no matter how much they disagree with them on every other point . 
  just to make sure i do n't understand you wrong : you 're speaking generally right ? 
  because if this was aimed at me , you misunderstood me . 
   people always did support something like it , but no politician ever gave voice to it . 
  go ahead and demonize anyone saying anything like it , you will just end up driving people in the middle and people on the left to politicians like trump or geert or the afd , because they have no other option . 
  people always felt uneasy : same as here in the netherlands . 
  relevant example : last week a survey came out stating that a majority of dutch employers did not want to employ young muslima 's in the workplace ( the goal was for them to get experience working in their future field of study ) . 
  it tells us once again what i already knew out of experience : people here in majority do n't want have anything to do with islam - myself included - yet it should not stop here . 
  there 's something extremely vile and dishonest about turning someone down before even meeting the person in question ( after meeting you can do as you wish , as long as you 're being honest in my view ) , and i do n't think we should reward that sentiment . 
  as you correctly stated , geert wilders , donald trump and the afd are capitalizing on this sentiment - and they are smart in doing that . 
  they know that there is a shared ideology at play among vested parties to force a culture of openness and forced respect upon all in society , even when you do n't want to have anything to do with the other person . 
  combine that with the general aversion towards islam ( which is semi-justified ) and you 'll have a recipe for large popular support . 
  the only way to change this is for the ruling elite to partially adopt the ideas of those entities , something which they in majority will not do . 
  but it only requires 1 or 2 large parties to turn in order to make that happen - and i think every country with this problem will shift to that scenario in due time . 
   i have no idea what in my answer lead you to write this . 
  it was implied , mostly as you seem to be using the same type of rhetoric of some other nutjobs on the internet . 
  my apologies then for misinterpreting your state of mind . 
   i am not even going to debate that because in the real world , this is a big deal . 
  in the real world , there are a lot of people that ca n't even subtract properly . 
  are we going to value the opinion of every person then ? 
  also , i completely detest what you want to imply here : that being that i do n't live the real world ( yeah , fuck that , you do n't know me * at all * ) . 
  this is as much of a deal as people want to make out of it , and in the end i - rational as i am - just see the mass murder on a couple of civilians that were target by a radical group . 
  a group that needs to be brought to justice or otherwise fought with current military means , but nothing more than that . 
   but the fact that they did manage to be successful , again , in committing mass murder . 
  just be honest : are you surprised ? 
  i think nobody is by now : these people will achieve their goals at some point in time : for every x number of cells security services have in their sights , a few might be able to pull it off . 
  now i could stay completely stuck in this , and make a case for european states to de facto abolish certain rights altogether ( us style ) , yet i wo n't do that . 
  the obvious answer is that it would achieve what these people are aiming at , and forgive me if i wo n't do that . 
  can you at least understand that position ? 
  let us think and carefully plan , just as these scumbags did . 
  after thinking it over properly , we can come up with some rational response to this mess . 
  it might make a difference in certain situations , but indeed , most of the time it just wo n't work ( bit difficult to pull a gun while you get bombed huh ) . 
  what i really want to know is what you are proposing here - as you seem to be driven by a certain ` solution ' in the background , one that skimming through your original post likely can not stand the light of day . 
  i want to know what we should do according to you , and how such a solution would - in your eyes - decrease such attacks in the next 30-ish years . 
  because i can tell you this : sending ground forces to syria will probably fuel extremist sentiment again . 
  if you are suggesting a war , or outright deportation ( i do n't know though ) , know that it equals shooting oneselve in the foot . 
  because everyone here is losing his/her mind it seems , while immediatly coming up with all kind of vaguely formulated solutions about what ought to happen . 
  the metaphor of me/people that think the same as getting ` fucked up ' is just inspired by fear : fear that they 'll ` get us all ' , while the chance of being caught up in a terrorist attack is probably smaller than being struck by lightning . 
  not to mention the passive aggressiveness in the end : ` it makes you look like a fool without a proper answer ' . 
  as if you have all the answers here : nobody knows what the correct course of action is . 
  the only thing we do know reasonably sure is that we need to properly think over how to respond - and judging from the responses in this topic it 's good that no one here is a lawmaker . 
  emotion rules the day again - same as with the paris attacks and exactly that once again shows how young this community is . 
  well still , it 's kind of a waste of time as skimming through the post , almost of all of what you stated is either common knowledge or just known by me . 
  i just think it 's too bad to spend four minutes of your life conveying that message , while at the same time the chance that anyone gets caught up in such carnage is extremely slim at best . 
  you could think about certain measures , as allowing concealed carry permits ( contrary to tradition in europe ) for the more paranoid people among us , but in the end about ~ 30-35 people died today . 
  in france about 130 died last year .
