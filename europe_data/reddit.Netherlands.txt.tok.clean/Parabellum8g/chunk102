  the populations of our nations , hell of europe , exceed that number by god knows how big of a magnitude . 
  which makes me believe the following : all this upheavel - all of it after a terror attack - directly roots in fear . 
  you ca n't get caught up in it ( statistically speaking the chance is extremely slim ) yet people completely lose their minds when it happens , again making sure that another attack will happen in the future . 
  why ? 
  because it obviously works : just skim through all the topics here on reddit to get the proof you need for it . 
  they do this shit because of the responses in this topic . 
  people need to get a hold of themselves and calm down for once , instead of ingesting spoons full of fear from the media . 
  the last thing we need today is another emotional trip into the realm of non-rationality . 
  belgium should just increase the bombings on raqqa and isis , but nothing more adventurous should be undertaken without properly thinking it over . 
  what is the appropriate response by the way ? 
  and do n't start talking about policy we all know that needs to be implemented : that 's already extremely obvious by now . 
  i just stuck out my neck to respond to a rather unclear response from your side , even stating that i did not disagree beforehand . 
  but / r/europe is immediatly losing its shit over a single picture again , and that is telling . 
  you can not completely prevent this - ever - and the aim of terrorism is to make people lose their minds . 
  that so many people here - mostly really young people - ** again ** fall for that ** trap ** is ridiculous enough . 
  in that sense , a bit of sang froid is certainly warranted here . 
  or do you have the illusion we can always prevent this shit , even if we demolish molenbeek and deport its residents ? 
  sure , it will be less likely if you get rid of such hotspots , but it will still happen . 
  when it happens , you just do n't need to play into the terrorist game - as so many people are doing in this topic . 
  really , this is the first time ever i did n't even bother to read a full reply to me on reddit . 
  you are extremely overreacting ( and skimming through the post it appears like you are making a lot of assumptions as well , with phrases as `` once you understand that ... '' ) and seeing things that are n't there to start out with . 
  no idea why you think that such a wall of text would convince me to believe a simple picture as outlined above is a cause for ` grave concern ' . 
  and as also said to some other guy : nobody hated the jesuischarlie cringe more than me . 
  i just do n't care enough about a single picture to get worked up about it so much to write an entire essay about it . 
  jesus , your emotional . 
  calm down for a second before you hurt yourself in the damn frenzy . 
  of course we all care about the victims , but the type of action that your type of person is proposing is probably counter-productive . 
  but yeah , it seems like people mistake my bluntness for some kind of support for the meme above as the ` appropriate way ' to respond . 
  i simply just do n't care that much about it , contrary to all the other drama queens ( mostly from eastern europe ) that are completely losing their shit over a simple picture . 
  nobody hated the jesuischarlie bullshit more than me , but i just wo n't embark on some internet crusade to prove my point about it . 
   do you think this picture strikes fear into the hearts of terrorists ? 
  you think it makes them realize , `` oh shit , we fucked up this time '' ? 
  that 's not the point at all . 
  i think you are missing the subtleties of ridiculing something here my friend . 
  you are taking the picture above way , ** wayyy ** , too seriously it appears , nor should you interpret it as ` the only way ' to respond to what happened in brussels today . 
   weak stuff . 
  everybody thinks it 's funny , i think it 's pathethic . 
  weak country , weak people . 
  mind explaining your opinion a bit more ? 
  i do n't disagree beforehand , but i 'd like to know your motivations for coming to this conclusion , as i simply see defiance in the face of the mortal enemies of our civilization . 
  ** edit : ** thanks for the downvotes , very mature of you . 
  reading this topic it is rather amazing that people completely lose their minds over a clich\u00e9 joke as posted above and immediatly have this unstoppable urge of placing it into the context of how terrorists perceive it . 
  the joke above is meant for a domestic/western public , not for the butchers in raqqa that will just lift their shoulders and go ahead with killing . 
  but do n't mind me : continue rioting over nothing !, 
  oh they 'll be able to live off their bank accounts for considerably longer , but i think saudi arabia may be in deep shit around 2035-2050 when the world economy starts to no longer be that much dependant on oil . 
  and in that case we might find ourselves in a war with that despotic place , as we have nothing more to gain from them when that time arrives . 
  indeed . 
  after telling/leaking to the media that * ignition switches * were found in the house where abdeslam his fingerprints were found as well as broadcasting the crucial information that he was willing to * comply * with the investigation , has more than likely forced their hand . 
  i was annoyed when the news of the fingerprints was leaked to the media , as it decreased the chances of catching abdeslam ( he could 've fled as a response ) . 
  the same feeling i got when the information above was broadcast to a large audience , as this is vital info that ought to be restricted to the investigation team - instead of sharing it with everyone . 
  i ca n't help but feel that their hand might not have been forced and that they ( the attackers ) * might * have been apprehended before the attacks . 
  total hindsight , but let us please reconsider what to share with the general public and more importantly , what we should n't share . 
  fully agree : that information should 've never left the confined circle of the justice department . 
  that together with yesterday 's news that ignition switches were found in the house where abdeslam his fingerprints were found , ** must ** have made the terrorists wary so they accelerated their plans . 
  the media should never have reported on these facts , nor should the government communicate such vital information about an ongoing investigation . 
  i hate to play captain hindsight here , but from where i 'm standing these attacks might have been prevented if this information would n't have been broadcast to everyone and his mother . 
  that high pitched voice , together with the aura of ` i 'm important ' hanging around him : it 's if he * wants * people to call him a dictator . 
  wooooooosh . 
  that is awkward . 
  someone else by the way annoyed beyond measure by his general rhetorical style ? 
  beautiful picture . 
  looks like an idyllic place to get properly drunk , somewhere in the shadowy corner of some traditional tavern . 
   in order to make the changes faster , we must educate people and showing to them that they are wrong . 
  not to mention criminalizing the behavior as outlined in the article , even in the absence of violence , which will also prove to be controversial in the early days . 
  it 'll be interesting to see which way countries like ukraine will move the next 20 or so years while under increased influence from more laissez-faire societies . 
   i 'm not for forcing , but they had to accept some laws before enter the union . 
  true , but tell me : how well off are homosexual people in eastern european member states of the eu ? 
  the status quo there is n't that much better ( though slighly better ) in many states , not to mention that every attempt to introduce our view on homosexuality is met with downright hostility it seems . 
  although i obviously agree with the core of your message regarding eu membership of ukraine : certain minimum standards have to be met , otherwise the already crumbling principles of the union will water down even further ( if not become limited to paper only , while no longer having real world application ) . 
   the point is that in a democracy they ca n't force others to live how they want . 
  the only thing they need to understand is that it 's not they life . 
  again : we agree , yet watch out how you want to convey that message . 
  if by doing so you achieved the opposite - and effectively delay acceptance of gay people out there - it wo n't be worth it . 
  there is much more at play than a lack of education here : the mores of our respective societies ( the one you live in and mine ) differ considerably from those of ukraine on topics like these . 
  education will not quickly root that out ( it can be an instrument in helping achieving it though ) - as society itself needs to change and adjust its views . 
  you are missing the point : random-guy410 is going further in his comments with respect to how to solve the attititude towards gay people in ukrainian society ( or at least implying he wants to go further than just silent diplomacy ) and i 'm warning him for the probable adverse results . 
  one thing is sure though : openly forcing our ideas upon them so they will change is not going to work as well , or worse , turn out to be counterproductive . 
  silent diplomacy could be used as an alternative to convince the ruling elite : such a change has to start top-down , and even then you can expect this to demand at least another three decades ( if not much more time ) to fully come to fruitition . 
  do n't forget that many of these people think that homosexuality is on the same level of pedophilia - just to outline the difficulties at play here . 
  exactly : it 's the same oppressive mindset that wants to bestow ones own ideas upon others with violence if need be . 
  they 're just underdeveloped scum . 
  i think they had a hunch about it , but could n't find him . 
  the rumors of him having fled to syria were probably spread by initiative of the security services to lure him out , in the hope that he would make a mistake . 
  rest assured that the authorities have n't lost molenbeek out of sight over the past few months and were probably watching it all this time . 
  this is the time to show we are civilized , and that we do n't kill people to achieve our ideological goals . 
  we just lock them up until they die out of agony !, 
  much better , do n't you think ? 
  no , but really , it 's vital that everyone stays calm and composed and does n't primarily react out of emotion again . 
  everyone knows who this guy is , what he is guilty to and what the actions of his group caused . 
  justice should now have its way , not just revenge , although it goes without saying that he should never * ever * be released . 
  i wonder how much help he got over the past few months , and how large this group of ` helpers ' really is , next to how they are organized . 
  it seems like he was eluding escape by virtue of an entire network of people that are all too willing to help ( and probably share the same ideas ) . 
  i hope they drag him through the courts for the next 10 years . 
  then you should take a good look at your political positions : you certainly are n't a ` regular ' lefty , especially with the presumptiousness that seems to be echo through your comments . 
  there is enough reason to say that you flirt with the radical/extreme side on the left side of the spectrum judging from the way you tend to approach people that think otherwise , or just blatantly label people that do n't agree with you as ` nazis ' . 
  and yes , you 've done that more than once , even when it was n't deserved and that kind of gave you a reputation in that sense . 
  forgive me if that tends to ` stick ' in the minds of people , including me , but as some of the rhethoric you spew out seem to mirror the antifa version of the ` left wing ' it is not difficult to see people judge you as that . 
  just think about it , that 's all i ask . 
  since they found fingerprints of him , it seems to be more likely abdeslam has n't escaped after all . 
  maybe that 's what the security services wanted him to believe though , just to lure him out .
