  but the chance of getting that murderer is slim at best . 
  if that 's the case , then your behavior in / r/europemeta and / r/europe with certain other ( far ) left commentators can be described as nothing else . 
  but you wo n't like this , as it kind of confirms the hypocrisy in play here . 
  you are free to comment by the way : i just want you to see the flaws in your own accusations . 
  if anyone here got a nearly insane habit of constantly crusading for his own right and in the process being downright denigrating towards those that think differently , then that person has to be you . 
  harsh words maybe , but that 's just how you strike me . 
  indeed , and people keep denying that this impression was created . 
  granted , the media played an important role in this as well also , but it does not disculpate the german government of their obligation to think twice before broadcasting their news . 
  the inactivity afterwards is what annoyed me the most back then : there was n't a clear limitation communicated to what germany could do , or a repeated message that people from non-warzones have no business in germany , at least not one that came even close to the reach of the original comment by the merkel administration . 
  thus the damage was done . 
  ** edit ** : the fact that this gets downvoted , without even bothering to respond , again proves that the most critical part of this question - that being the * impression * that was created - is still standing firmly as a point of criticism . 
  the quotes above reaffirm this in my view . 
  permits can differ : in some countries you need to fulfill extra requirements ( and you 'll get another , additional permit ) for assault rifles for example . 
  or maybe that 's just another category on your permit , that could be possible as well . 
  there 's an article about it on nos [ also ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2093207-nederlanders-gepakt-in-polen-omdat-ze-wapens-wilden-kopen.html ) . 
  rather ironic that those guys go to poland of all countries to buy weapons : i ca n't imagine other countries in europe where they 'd stand out even more . 
  question , can one buy an ak-47 for example - or in general an assault rifle - in poland with just a basic permit ? 
  or do you need more than that ? 
  could n't agree more - and again like with the riots in rome last summer a feeling of utter shame creeps up . 
  i hope these people get dealt with accordingly . 
  also , the people that join the ` harde kern ' ( the dutch term for ultra 's ) are in the rule just lowlifes , with nothing to do and problems growing up . 
  you can hardly see them as representative in that view , but still ... 
   we can say that we were the first great victim of the terrorism we now see playing out before our eyes , '' defence minister antoni macierewicz said , he 's the conspiracy nut in the current government , right ? 
  sad that pis is getting to lower levels with each passing day it seems - and it does n't reflect well on poland as a whole . 
  without conclusive and clear evidence to back this up , the diplomatic damage is also not worth it . 
  i 'm not criticizing them to be exact : i 'm critizing the people responsible for bringing in large groups of people from foreign , very different countries . 
  those people from abroad ca n't help it , as they were promised that everything would be * fine * ( and easy ) . 
  naturally they 'll have problems adapting - and i 'd rather just opt for helping in the region to circumvent this problem altogether . 
  next to that , i 'm truly convinced that will bring people actually closer together compared to forcing them to live together in the first place . 
  ** edit : ** that aside , there of course should be renewed effort to bring those that are already in sweden up to speed . 
  they after all can not be sent back anymore . 
  interesting view - and i can also see your point . 
  if i summarize it correctly , society would not progress if you take away the struggle or strife in it , as that will do away with an important incentive to evolve or innovate , correct ? 
  that really is some interesting stuff right here , and it also touches what it means to be an individual . 
  but still , we should at least strongly aspire to decrease the problems our societies have between ` groups ' ( as much as i dislike that term ) , even though that is indeed never 100 % possible . 
  but a more brotherly atmosphere would be welcome i 'd say . 
  it is difficult to measure , but there are some obvious clues . 
  they way people self identity to the outside world is one ( many people with ` double ' nationalities identify with one of them primarily , but not both ) or the language one prefers to speak in private . 
  although there is ( as you also said before ) an anecdotal element at play in measuring this , but i 've come few positive examples of people with multiple nationalities ( mind you : i 'm not only speaking from a legal point of view ) , especially where the other ( foreign ) one is dominant . 
  i 'd rather see society become as harmonious as possible - and every type of discord should be prevented by all possible means : that way no one will be left behind - and social cohesion will increase . 
  for me it 's a done deal that society will profit from it in the long term , but we wo n't find out if we continue on this road . 
  edit : spelling . 
  i hope you 're right : in that case the consequences remain more limited , albeit still highly negative for society in the long run . 
  but i 'm not sure that is the case : when a teacher needs to divide his attention among multiple ` weaker ' students other more advanced students will suffer because of it - as the class tends to stay more stuck in basic things . 
  but that 's conjecture : maybe further research is necessary to prove who is affected . 
   most of the ones i know may consider themselves turkish , but they also consider themselves germans . 
  if you do not consider this a problem , then i fully understand why you do n't share the same view . 
  i 've come across loads of people from turkish and moroccan descent in the netherlands that self identify as either turkish or moroccan ( in the first place at least ) , while they 're never really * accepted * in either society . 
  it leads to people feeling estranged , or not accepted , and that 's why it 's better to strife towards helping the same category of people in taking the entity of their home state . 
  that does not mean one has to fully give up being e.g. 
  turkish - even though i 'd rather see that - as that would not work in practice . 
  but ones turkish identity would need to be clearly subservient to ones german identity to prevent this type of identity conflict . 
  the conflict i 'm talking about here can really screw with people 's sense of ` belonging ' and it all too often is a factor in people lagging behind or not being accepted overall - which results in other negative things ( crime , destructive behavior , etc. ), 
  also for those interested , an english [ article ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20160314/foreign-born-students-weaken-school-results ) from the local dealing with the same subject . 
  interesting flair you got there . 
  so , in short , the mean level of the average student decreases as a result of other students that need more and extensive tutoring . 
  a terrible side effect of an already abysmal ideological project : one could say that the native population as a result is getting less intelligent , for the sake of bringing in more people from distant countries . 
  of course there are more factors at play than only this , but damn it this is infuriating . 
  it shows what this destructive policy also leads to - and it is n't nice . 
   `` the federal government will continue the refugee policy with all our strength , at home and abroad , '' the chancellor 's spokesman steffen seibert told a news conference , adding that it was vital to facilitate `` the ** integration ** for the people who sought protection and found it here . '' best of luck with that : i honestly mean it . 
  because if history has shown us one thing in europe , it 's that integration equals segregation in the absence of strong assimilation policies . 
  the real results of what is happening now will probably be clear in one or two decades at the earliest , when the electoral repercussions could be just as severe . 
  i deny that was said : i called the shift towards the afd a remarkable change in attitude , as that party is rather radical . 
  what happened yesterday was n't nothing in that sense , as a certain group of people has shifted to the far / radical right - and that should be cause for worry . 
  also , it 's not weird that parties that support the current policy gain drastically : besides regional variations , that 's the uniform position of parties on the national level . 
  the afd is a notable exception - the only one in its kind - and therefore some people go for it . 
  as said above : i do n't celebrate the afd winning a large part of voter share , but this result is deserved as it a response to how choice there really is among mainstream parties if you are radically against the current influx . 
  maybe , but it 's still very far away : just imagine the phrase ` one nation under god ' disappearing . 
  and even then you can ask yourself if the complete disappearance of christianity for example is a good thing . 
  i consider myself to be an atheist , but all too often i come across people that are n't ( strictly ) religious and at the same time have lousy moral convictions , if not a complete lack of common decency . 
  those people by the way probably fall in the category lapsed catholic / general ` not knowing what to believe ' category . 
  atheists in general always seem to be sophisticated or at least semi-sophisticated people in my memory and are n't part of that category it seems . 
  i mean : if religion would disappear altogether i 'd opt for ethics lessons from a very young age already , far into high school , to ensure that society stays civilized in the long run . 
  for a long time religion was the binding factor in ensuring that society would be a hospitable place , but with that factor decreasing you can already quite a bit of wear and tear in how people communicate with one another . 
  pro refugee is correct i think , but strongly anti-migrant . 
  that 's important to notice . 
  thanks for the insult : i 'll find a special place for it . 
  no , before you ask , i 'm not a person that only reads the telegraaf , actually i like to read just about every newspaper as long as it is n't extremely biased to one side . 
  when talking about dutch media that also includes the nrc , the volkskrant , etc. 
  although , maybe i could bounce this back and ask the same question to you ? 
  since we 're drawing conclusions beforehand i might as well ask whether you only get your ideas out of the volkskrant and the more leftwing subreddits ? 
  see how easy it is . 
  in the end you achieve nothing by asking those questions , and only partake in drawing conclusions beforehand on zero evidence . 
  i think it 's good to admit that this notion is always highly influenced by english speaking media , or national media here ( even though they 're more leaning to the left ) . 
  out of curiosity : is it possible for a national politician from a mainstream party to say - in front of a camera - that germany has no obligation in helping these people or that other measures ( for example in the region ) should be taken ? 
  there 's still this strong impression on my side that said person will be sabered down by the media the day after - and by fellow politicians directly after . 
  since you 're german , you are way more fit to tell me whether or not this would likely be the case , so could you give your idea about what would happen then ? 
   you do realize that 2 pro-refugee-merkel parties won elections and gained votes ? 
  help me out here : was the opposite suggested then ? 
  it 's just that the afd has made an important breakthrough , and that does deserve some commentary . 
  although as you correctly pointed out above , * overall * not much changed , yet the people that did vote for the afd made an important shift further to the right would n't you say ? 
  indeed , and i share that sentiment ( albeit a bit watered down ) . 
  but if people have no way to turn this * will be * the result . 
  political parties therefore better turn and ensure that their views are more in line with what is prevalent in society , instead of lecturing the people from the cozyness of their ivory tower . 
  it is by the way again highly interesting to see how the rise of the afd mirrors the rise of the pvv in the past , as well as the rise of the pvv in the polls in the recent past . 
  once again : there is a similar pattern in multiple european nations . 
   so , by your definition around 85 percent germans are not `` the people '' or what ? 
  well , no idea why you immediatly feel the need to frame me and put words in my mouth that are n't mine to begin with . 
  to be blunt : the answer to your question is clearly no , although that was obvious already . 
  i 'm saying that there is much more anti-immigrant in german society than people will publicly admit and the result of these elections will mark another shift in public opinion .
