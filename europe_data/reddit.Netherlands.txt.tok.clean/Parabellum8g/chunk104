  it is out of this world to deny that this was a defeat for the people that are more permissive about this subject . 
  not to mention that the mainstream political parties in germany are no alternative for people that rather see far less people flowing in on a daily basis , so naturally they 'll choose the more radical option . 
  another brutal and terrible attack against normal citizens : sick that people need to make their ` point ' this way . 
  i however at this point mostly wonder how this attack will be interpreted and what the next moves of the turkish government may be . 
  completely deserved result . 
  as long as the climate for discussing the refugee influx stays stuck in a moralistic , overly correct atmosphere , democracy will ensure that such a disconnect between the people and its leaders will be mended by means of the ballot box . 
  in another view , this result can be placed in the ( maybe worrying ? ), 
  rise of the populations parties all over europe - and even germany will not be spared of it . 
  one can wonder how the german political landscape will look like in 10 to 20 years , even when the refugee crisis has long subsided . 
  people now know it is possible to strike back - and that such efforts are not in vain . 
  ** edit : ** reading this in hindsight , it may be important to say that i do not condone the policies of the afd as whole , but the fact that the afd won quite a bit of share in the elections is a symptome of a larger problem . 
  as long as there are no other moderate parties that can give the people the same they want from the afd , this trend will continue . 
  in that sense , the result of these elections is ` deserved ' , as it stimulates politicians to rethink certain things . 
  i almost took your bait  . 
  what can you tell me about the source ? 
  before everyone gets all worked up due to only reading the title , could some swedish guy give a translation of the article ? 
  that 'll be necessary to put this into context . 
  i 'll probably be outraged as well , but i 'd like to know the exact legal reasoning behind this . 
  sorry , we 're running out ourselves . 
  we asked mario to print more money , which he will . 
  at least that 's what he said . 
   i just think that in terms of foreign relations , germany can not take a passive/neutral role , and has to act like any other country . 
  i know you probably meant it otherwise , but in the light of the recent drama in europe of the past several years you can hardly blame germany for being ` passive ' . 
  in terms of soft power germany is probably the most powerful nation in europe , and surely the most powerful one in mainland europe . 
  germany should just up its military budget and partake in more un peacekeeping missions or something like it . 
  that would be a good way to marry the pacifist sentiment in german society with the pragmatic position a great power should take . 
  i think the average european could n't care less . 
  the reddit demographic - or in a wider sense the people responding on the internet - is something else altogether . 
  as for the dutch situation : i come across way more complaints about the battered size of our military compared to the people who think we should ` slim down ' even further . 
  i think most people with some basic knowledge about this problem would admit to feeling rather ashamed of leeching of the us for something as basic as national security . 
   no , its not misplaced . 
  its a occupation can you stop with the circular reasoning ? 
  i mean : it 's fully clear that you have this ideological idea that the us is the ` occupier ' of germany here ( and probably other nations in europe ) , yet you only defend that by bending the definition of ~ ~ oppression ~ ~ occupation by stripping it of the aggressive parts that make up the definition , and by referring to history . 
  according to your logic , a military presence of another country after sort of inviting that military into your country by your own action can be counted as occupation ( debatable , but ok ) , * together * with completely denying the political changes between 1945-2015 , a timespan of a whopping 70 years . 
  it 's not like the us its presence in germany is of the same nature as in the autumn of 1945 . 
  especially the latter is what people are pointing out here : the americans will immediatly leave if the german government would insist on it , which would not have happened in 1945 : in that case the people asking for it would 've been replaced immediatly . 
  what occupant would leave the country it is occupying after the occupied would ask nicely ? 
  ** edit : ** noticed a typo . 
  oppression was meant to be ` occupation ' . 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  implying they are n't now , thank you . 
  not in amsterdam , not in london ( and do n't even start about the incidental rigby case ) , not in paris , etc. 
   the us occupied part of germany after ww2 and has never left . 
  ask yourself the question if the us would leave if germany 's government would ask for it . 
  the answer is yes . 
  it is * completely misplaced * to talk of ` occupation ' in this regard , as those bases are there by the consent of the german government . 
  and occupation does not need to be violent per se ( at least , not after the initial phase ) but it sure is coercive and overall oppressive in nature . 
  if you believe that the us is some kind of imperialist over european nations where it got military installations , even after this , well , i think you 're just too far gone . 
  well it 's true after all : there are way too many freeriders within nato . 
  i think it would be misplaced of anyone here to deny that is the case . 
  why are you just repeating yourself ? 
  he gave an example , just retort to it if you do n't agree . 
  circular reasoning is n't going to help you here . 
  indeed - and the fact that the memories to those regimes are fading and the newer generation got no first hand knowledge about it things like this are more likely to happen . 
  but really , any pis supporter that still supports the party after what was quoted above can rightfully be called a fascist in my eyes . 
  and mind you : i ca n't even remember when i used that word to denounce someone or a certain group , but at this point that term seems to be in place . 
  the people that support these kind of politics are closet dictators in their own right . 
  in a way it is , but as / u / - plastic - also stipulated : why let an idiot speak ? 
  why give him room to do so ? 
  one can not expect any constructiveness from letting someone utter such language , therefore there is more than enough reason to temporarily expel such a person . 
  people that are highly detrimental to a discussion should be thrown out of said discussion , in order to make sure normal discourse can have its way . 
   `` prime minister beata szyd\u0142o said on tuesday she would ** refuse ** to officially publish the tribunal 's pronouncement - a step essential for it to be valid - because the court sitting would not be taking place `` in accordance with the law currently in force . '' right , the polish government is now the supreme authority on the validity of polish law . 
  i hope that everyone that was stupid enough to vote for this party by now realized what they pulled in : a gathering of autocratic idiots that do n't care about the rule of law , and that are willing to sacrifice the separation of powers for political goals . 
  people should be even more wary of this government now . 
   but the judge rejected his mitigation and said the offences could not be put down to cultural differences , adding that they were simply sexually motivated . 
  well , that 's the only correct way of putting it . 
  it would be crazy to accept such a defence in situations like these , and i 'm glad to see that infamous ` escape ' did n't apply here . 
  it goes without saying that you are expected to adapt to the customs and laws of the state you 're living in , not the other way around . 
  although on a different note , the uk horribly failed in integrating this man . 
  you can ask yourself if they should have allowed him to enter in the first place . 
  is there some kind of ` procedure ' to point out to newcomers how they are to behave for example ? 
  because i can remember the dutch agency that is concerned with handling asylum applications ( coa ) is giving newcomers lessons of what is considered normal and acceptable in the netherlands , and what is n't . 
  because a small faction keeps pushing for it , while all parties involved still know it 's likely impossible . 
  why those people are pushing for it escapes me though . 
  of course , and that 's how the diplomatic game works in the end . 
  there will be some kind of compromise , but that compromise will be difficult to sell again . 
  implying that civil war will happen , which is far from certain especially if you look at the history of coup d'etats in turkey . 
  but there should be no obstacle to take all possible solutions into account , although it goes without saying the solution above should be the ** last one ** on the list , until all diplomatic measures have been exhausted . 
  turkey under erdogan is more and more becoming a threat instead of a mere obstacle - and we ought to take the current situation in turkey into account when negotiating with its government . 
  i have actually , though by now the last time i spoke to one face by face is like 5 years ago . 
  not surprisingly they were n't the same by the way they reasoned : some saw erdogan and moreover the ak party as a means to an end , others saw him as a necessary solution to get rid of all the ` fuss ' turkey had been dealing with in the past , others saw him as the economic messiah of turkey , etc. 
  but judging from the ak supporters that pop up on / r/europe on a regular basis ( and other places ) i feel rather easy to say there is a large fanatic faction among them . 
  highly controversial solution : back a coup in turkey , to stop erdogan before it 's too late . 
  you would kill two birds with one stone : the refugee crisis ( for 90 % at least , if a new government takes the place of the current one ) and most importantly turkey its increasing internal problems due to the current government would be resolved . 
  erdogan will after all not leave via the ballot box . 
  of course , such an act would need to be bloodless , and that 's why it is unlikely to work . 
  not to mention that there are a lot of rough edges to such a proposal , most importantly ` doing away ' with democracy on the short term . 
  but let us not deny that the eu is either dependant on turkey to solve the crisis , or it opts to go on a military adventure into syria ( which is extremely unlikely at this point ) . 
  edit : and there 's more at stake than just that of course , that being that turkey is increasingly becoming a powder keg in its own right . 
  its nato membership would normally imply a certain amount of responsibility to not let things get out of hand due to the nature of this military alliance , but even that is far from guaranteed at this point . 
  you could ask yourself if the eu and other nations should still back the current turkish government , given that it is drifting closer and closer to autocracy with each passing day - and ideologically further away from its ` friends ' in the eu and nato . 
  apparantly pm rutte wants to push for taking in no immigrants ( note : the eu has if i 'm not mistaken pledged to take in a number of around 200.000 / 300.000 a year ) until turkey completely stems the flow of migrants . 
  you have to remember that rutte himself got the elections of march 2017 here in the back of his head - and more importantly - the upcoming referendum about the association treaty with ukraine . 
  he has to prove the eu is able to solve problems like this , or it will reflect badly on the current government . 
  i think the latter pretty much sums up my point : the distinction between both is what divides us between different lines of thinking , combined with the goals of punishment in general ( you 're not in favor of defending a norm , but in favor of defending people ) . 
  well , i think we pretty much got to the core of it , thanks for this argument !, 
  we might not agree , but it 's always interesting to see your own views challenged . 
  it keeps me sharp - and i think the same applies to you . 
   but i get that we have different viewpoints on that - yeah , it 's ok we have different viewpoints on it !, 
  this will always remain to be a ` loaded ' topic that is highly influenced by ones personal views , and i 'm glad that we managed to keep it civil .
