  normally it are discussions like these that can fully spiral out of control in no time . 
   and if society chose to spare my killer out of a misplaced sense of righteousness i would consider it a betrayal - that you consider his life more precious than mine . 
  we disagree here : there is no verdict about the life of the murderer being more precious . 
  the idea underlying my position is that all life is precious , no matter whether it is the life of a total scumbag or yours . 
  it however is a moot point that you will be much higher in stature than some low life that decided to go on a killing spree . 
  locking someone up for life could also hardly be seen as ` merciful ' , given how hopeless such an existence is . 
   how is locking up a murderer justice ? 
  stopping them from hurting others is n't justice . 
  it 's a precaution . 
  this question is of course deeply intertwined with what ` justice ' really means - and the meaning of justice tends to fall apart in different viewpoints . 
  if you are a proponent of a certain viewpoint it is easier to see the death penalty as justified , or ( on the contrary ) have great difficulty justifying it altogether . 
  i 'm not saying that i alone have the right to ` define ' what justice really means and there certainly is room for your opinion in that regard . 
  i however am warning about the thoughts and ideas that feed this desire for bloodshed , even in the name of justice . 
   you think of killing as wrong , but i think of murder as wrong , and killing a murderer as right . 
  a society has an obligation to defend the innocent and to give them justice if they 've already failed at defending them . 
  it 's a duty , not a right , and not vengeance - it 's not for us , it 's not for the family , it 's for the victim . 
  i completely follow your reasoning and it is pretty classical also : there 's a heavy , almost exclusive focus on the victim as you see more often with proponents of the death penalty and i 'm not going to discard that by default . 
  after all , the victim as an entity is at least as important as society when it comes down to judging a crime , but then again what i said in the previous comment still stands : do not immediatly accept that the next of kin of said victim will want the perpetrator dead . 
  that is far from always the case in countries that actually have the death penalty ( for example the us ) . 
  however , in this case the percentage of people that wants the perpetrator to be kept in captivity is probably rather low , taking into account local culture and what isil has done so far . 
  what i always find contradictory to the death penalty is that the moral taboo on murder ( and on killing in general ) suddenly has to subside for it , while the punishment issued boils down to the same : killing , if not downright murder ( if you were to strip ` malicious ' out of ` malicious aforethought ' ) . 
  how can you defend a ** norm ** ( e.g. 
  the outlawing of murder ) by imposing a sentence that is similar to the ** crime ** ( e.g. 
  the death penalty ) ? 
  you really have to ask yourself what you are protecting in the first place then , as well as what kind of thoughts feed that desire to see the perpetrator meet his end . 
   but aside from that - these people would have killed again , and we do n't have the option of taking them into custody . 
  their deaths stopped them from killing more , and that is a wonderful thing . 
  the accidental justice is just gravy . 
  well , i would n't call it wonderful ( edit : if you meant the deaths of the perps ) , but indeed : if you can not apprehend them and put them to trial , ending their lives to protect others ( for example by a bombardment , the same way jihadi john met his end ) could be morally justified . 
  but even then we ought not to think lightly about it . 
  i 'm against killing other people out of principle ( save situations of self defence of course ) , yet when rational thought urges me to consider abandon that position on an incidental basis i could live with it . 
  it is healthier * in my view * as it is n't an agressive mindset to start out with . 
  being able and willing to turn the other cheek and accept that the person in question will never be able to harm society anymore if locked up alive should be enough . 
  the wish to see someone dead is n't that different from the wish to kill yourself : the main difference is that someone else will do it for you , yet you still approve of the act of ending another life . 
  also , be * very * careful about speaking what the victims want : many people just want closure when a loved one got killed , not further bloodshed . 
  justice can be imposed by other means than killing , or do you disagree with that ? 
  yeah , ` dutch ' by virtue of their passport . 
  a very thin layer it is , yet it is there still . 
  it turns out that something typically dutch - that being disagreeing and wanting to argue about the merits of something - spelled their end . 
  ironic is n't it ? 
  i think we all know that . 
  not wishing death upon someone is not a sign of sympathy , but just an ethical position . 
  i will not grieve them , and i doubt anyone besides their direct family will . 
  but to wish someone dead , that being that their existenced ends forever out of sheer vengeance , that 's just a mindset i do not want to adopt . 
  i also think it 's healthier to refrain from holding such ideas . 
  justice for their victims , but by who 's hand ? 
  that 's also another thing you should consider . 
  isil is n't really the best example when it comes down to administrating justice . 
  if you read approval from me into that comment , you ought to read again . 
  they got what they could 've ** expected ** by joining such a club , that is all that was said . 
  even for them , i will never approve capital punishment . 
  thanks for the link , yet i myself have a legal background . 
  that link , an article in ` psychology today ' , is by its conditions so open for interpretation that what i said could easily be puzzled into the side of ` justice ' , compared to the more irrational variant called revenge . 
  i think you have severely misinterpreted my position regarding murder : it 's the ethical condemnation of a horrifying crime that knows no equal . 
  one could say it even damages one 's feeling of humanity , and in the end this crime is the prime example of primitive and disrespectful behavior towards the life of another . 
  to institutionally punish crimes of such a nature is to demonstrate ultimate moral condemnation for such depraved acts , where a mandatory life sentence would cement this disapproval . 
  murdering another person is highly damaging to the fabric of society , therefore it is all but unjustified that the state would take harsh measures to repair the damage inflicted . 
  indeed : the retributive element is strongly represented , yet there is more at play in the background . 
  also , notice that crimes like manslaughter would generally not fall in the same category in my view , as those are different by their characteristics . 
  if you want to get back this feel free to do so , i 'm off to sleep though . 
  justice got multiple goals , yet not all need to be fulfilled to speak of justice . 
  otherwise terminology like ` retributive justice ' for example would also not exist . 
  if you believe that justice by default comprises the word ` rehabilitation ' then i have to break it to you : this is not correct . 
  rehabilitation can be just another goal of justice , one that can be chosen or ignored . 
  you have reached sentience , have n't you [ ukball ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/8/89/425373_586231471407808_1474775674_n-1-.png/revision/latest?cb=20150729143656&amp;path-prefix=sco ) ? 
   your opinion does not make that true in any way . 
  ` neither does your opinion make the death penalty justified ' . 
  should we really resort to this ? 
  my position is born out of ethical considerations , and is certainly not ` extremely dangerous ' . 
  the fact that you consider me to be ` extremely dangerous ' for not giving in to primal desires is worrying . 
  needless to say , our positions are both influenced by how we value human life . 
   excuse me ? 
  you talk about moral high ground ? 
  on basis of what ? 
  where was the high moral ground that allowed the murderer to kill ? 
  why dont you ask them that ? 
  again , you dodge the question . 
  you immediatly go to the victim , yet you do not answer the question whether punishing a murderer by killing him ( another murder ) is justified in itself . 
  i want to know whether you notice the contradiction - and why you distinquish between both . 
   simple solution , execute them immediatly this is not how it works : due process will have to be observed . 
  everyone got and should have the right to appeal their sentence . 
  thing is , appeals can last a very long time , as long as multiple decades in some circumstances ( if you consider closing and reopening of the case ) . 
  there is no way to just ` do it ' immediatly if the convict is deadset on fighting to the highest court and using all tricks in the book to delay his punishment . 
   sanity ? 
  come on , you can do better than that . 
  if you are introducing requirements for the death penalty ( the most extreme of cases ) you could be a bit more specific about what constitutes such a case . 
  multiple homicides ? 
  aggrevated murder ? 
  the age of the victim ( for example a child ) ? 
   because it is a consequence of the murder . 
  the result of it . 
  because the original murder was done willfully - intentionally - for no good reason - for selfish purposes - committed on innocents without any good reason for it . 
  alright , but the mechanism of capital punishment still boils down to the same : peel off all the layers of official nonsense and what you still end up with is one human killing another . 
  the real difference would be that this person would not act in a premeditated manner , but on instruction by the state , but even then the act would still very much be the same : one human ending another life . 
  as you notice , the comparison i 'm drawing between murder and capital punishment is the outcome in which both result : death , by the hand of another . 
  to counter your highly snarky tone : indeed , from a procedural point of view both differ , yet in the end people 's lives are still ended by violence . 
   because prisons as they are are leisure hostels that waste resources and money on keeping cancer alive and well fed and satisfied , instead of cutting it off . 
  yeah , ok . . maybe arguing with you was a bad idea after all , as this gives a false and highly populist idea of how it works in practice . 
  there 's nothing wrong with feeling that way , even though said persons kind of got what they could 've expected . 
  i think its a bit in bad taste to celebrate the death of people , even total scumbags , and doing the opposite is dehumanizing in itself .
