  he likes to play hardball and now some other countries do the same . 
  just a note by the way ( directed at everyone reading this ) : the entire tone of this ` debate ' is incredibly poisonous , including in this topic . 
  can we please talk about it in a less agonizing way ? 
  yep , that 's the logical conclusion if you ca n't fix the link . 
  just to show you the other side of the coin : this ` solidarity ' you speak off ( yes i 'm aware of it being one of the founding ideas behind the eu ) is not to be found on this side on europe . 
  it 's mostly considered to be a local , regional problem instead of eu-wide problem here . 
  and as / u/violetjoker correctly put it : it should n't be the problem of other countries as well , just because greece can not handle the issue at hand . 
  i think everyone understands that greece is overencumbered , but it still amazes me that a nation state like greece can not fully lock down its borders , even if part of its territory forms an archipelago . 
  i agree that greece should be helped with eu funding if need be ( further funding than has already been promised in 2015 ) , yet we should not abandon the idea that a state ought to be able to take care of such fundamental tasks . 
  not to mention that influx is being used as a ** pressure tool ** by greece !, 
  do you consider it weird that austria and some other local allies that are * bothered * by it take this course of action then ? 
  action - response , that 's what it is . 
  tsipras did this himself if you ask me . 
  ** edit ** : classic / r/europe again , poisonous to the max . 
  there 's no point in any of this anymore : the situation is way too polarized to even exchange thought in the first place . 
  foolish of me to think so in the first place . 
  it reminds of the greek bailout topics from the past , where the same kind of aggression and general abrasive atmosphere was found all over this subreddit . 
  you could fix the link with a bbc source , and excuse the op for the link this once . 
  i take it that 's possible ? 
  hence i said ' * especially * the problem with pakistan ' . 
  until those countries buckle , which should be possible on short notice if sufficient pressure is exerted , greece should just take care of them in their own national setting . 
  do n't get me wrong : i know that greece is overencumbered , but that does not take away the fact that the greek government is shifting the problem to other european states . 
  over here the influx is hardly seen as a ` european problem ' and if one crucial eu member state can stem the tide it ought to be greece . 
  it demands a full lockdown of all coastal areas though , as well as swift and non-bureaucratic procedures . 
  the sooner greece achieves doing that ( again , if need be with eu funding ! ), 
  the earlier this crisis will be resolved . 
  most importantly : word needs to get out that fortress europe is locked down , as that will severely demotivate people from trying to reach europe in the first place . 
  yeah , especially the problem with pakistan has been dealt with in detail in the media . 
  however , there are other ` pressure ' methods to ensure those economically weaker and more dependent countries will come around , if need be with financial support from our side . 
  you are n't going to tell me that a major european state , or even the eu , can not coerce some african state to take their damn nationals back ? 
  it 's just powerplay - and we have to show we 're much better at it than those governments . 
  make sure that the consequences will be * severe * if they do not take their own nationals back . 
  just think about in the first place : you flee slovenia ( hypothethically speaking ) and when the country you fled to wants to deport you back ( for example the us ) your own government will say ` ehm yeah sorry , that craftyspastic guy , ehm , we do n't want him back . 
  he is n't really loyal and stuff so ... ' it completely infringes on the idea of nationality in the first place , do n't you agree ? 
   so , what now ? 
  come on , really ? 
  if you could by use of an accelerated procedure decide someone odds of getting asylum or near zero , you can simply transport said people back to where they came from . 
  if need be the greek government ( with eu funding ) could charter freight ships or airplanes to return those people to where they came from . 
  something tells me that 's cheaper than taking care of them in greece ( or elsewhere in europe ) . 
  once you got the logistics right , you should be able to deport thousands of them on a daily basis . 
  times 365 that would result in total nullification of the influx if everyone coming in would not be considered eligible for asylum - which is not the case by the way . 
  a large minority of those people will probably be eligible for asylum , just to be clear . 
  [ another article dealing with the same subject ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35658776 ) , just for context . 
  greece forms a hole in the schengen framework that needed to plugged yesterday already , yet not much seems to be happening . 
  as long as the greek government is unable or even unwilling to perform that fundamental task of statehood - that being border control - there is no reason other countries should suffer because of it . 
  of course , eu funds for greek border control should once again be increased ( above the funds promised earlier on ) if required . 
  but at this point the cold rational decision of leaving greece to its own defences may be the only logical step , harsh as it may be . 
  greece is not the only country suffering from the influx : the entire balkan route is as well , and those nations certainly have a say in this . 
  is it true that de gaulle refused to take on the presidency if those changes were n't implemented ? 
  at least , that 's what i always understood about the current french republic . 
  hey , do n't start out like that . 
  the true dutch are the people that speak with a soft g , instead of that raped , rasping version of it you hear in the north . 
  feel free to include southern provinces like limburg and north-brabant into the category of ` true dutch '  . 
   solar really is n't an option as a primary energy source for us in northern europe . 
  i beg your pardon ? 
  solar panels are getting ever more efficient and offer the best chances of decentralizing the energy network . 
  if the comment above is based on the popular misconception that solar panels only work when the sun shines ( and is not obstructed by clouds ) , then here it is : it does n't work like that . 
  although solar panels * are * a lot more inefficient outside of ideal conditions , but even that will improve with rising efficiency . 
  i think there 's an economic reason for that : it 's probably ( slightly ) more windy on the north sea , resulting in better efficiency overall . 
  or environmentalist parties like groenlinks just want to bully citizens like me and stubbornly place them into or near the backyards of people  . 
  thank you . 
  well , coal plants are immediatly just about the worst example ( save a nuclear reactor that is suffering a meltdown , heh ) : i think few people want such a thing in their backyards as well . 
  but if we are to find a compromise between fossil fuels and renewable energy , i 'd rather opt for solar panels instead of windpower . 
  solar panels in some way tend to blend into the landscape much better , but that probably has to with the fact that they ( at least on houses ) blend with an already artificial background . 
  a wind turbine on the other hand ` stands out ' in the wild , to the point that it becomes really disturbing . 
  but hey , we are drifting from the subject at hand here : trees !, 
   i do n't think there were many trees to begin with in current netherlands , even in the medieval ages . 
  i can remember a roman author describing the netherlands as one big swamp-ish like country , rugged and difficult at times ( even though that did n't stop the romans at all ) . 
  but that aside : when i was talking about deforestation i referred to the proces that has been going on since times immemorial * , however it is interesting to see that this trend is turning ( even if it is a small gradual difference ) . 
  there was no suggestion in the comment above that we have been burning down the forests we did n't have in the first place  . 
  depends : if you meant windturbines , then they certainly are poluting the horizon . 
  i would go to the highest court with my entire neighbourhood to prevent any of those abominations getting in my view . 
  no , i do n't have anything against renewable energy - and that includes windenergy - but i 'd be better to keep those things restricted to offshore parks instead of placing them on land . 
  unless someone would make an effort to properly blend them in with the landscape , but that 's going to be hard . 
  windmills in general are of course ok : they are a part of the history of the nation and not seldomly pretty to look at !, 
  ** edit : ** downvotes for denouncing the uglyness of these machines ? 
  i do n't know about you , but i think citizens do have something to say about these things being placed near their own backyards - as has long been acknowledged in judicial procedures here as well . 
  but feel free to place one in your own backyard : in the meanwhile i 'll try to burn it down if it gets in my view . 
  source on what exactly ? 
  most of the land here in the netherlands has been deforested since early medieval times to make room for about 17 million people as of 2016 . 
  it 's hardly a secret that there is n't that much to be seen out here , not when it comes down to nature . 
  the netherlands : also leading in deforestation . 
  it 's a depressing sight though : flat farmland with no hills and no forest in sight . 
  i 've seen it often enough to have become accustomed to it , but we sure are missing out on something again . 
  i did n't know the left as a cohesive block existed in the first place . 
  i guess the world gets a whole lot easier thinking it does , but let me help you out of that thought : it does n't exist like that . 
  neither does ` the right ' : they 're just descriptive terms , nothing more . 
  of course : the third world war is only a matter of time in that sense . 
  once the last generation with first hand or second hand experience of the destructive nature of war has been marginalized or has disappeared altogether , the next one will follow . 
  all the elements are there already , some of them decades old , e.g. 
  the failure of the unsc to act according to its founding goals . 
  not to mention the romantization of warfare in fiction , as well as the increasingly harsh and simplistic tone in any debate out there . 
  either generation y or generation z will trigger it . 
  interesting to see how that is very much comparable to the netherlands ( save the part about the trust , i believe it does n't work the same way here ) . 
  it is another example of how much national civil law systems within europe tend to have in common . 
  also , the 50 % criterium ( if you meant 50 % of what he or she would 've entitled to under normal circumstances ) is identical . 
  the same applies to rules about giving money and property in general away in the sight of death . 
  a similar law in our civil code ( civil code book 4 , article 63 onwards ) regarding disinheriting children is in effect in the netherlands as well . 
  you ca n't disinherit your child further than 50 % of what he or she would 've been entitled to by law in the absence of a will . 
  here it 's called ` legitieme portie ' .
