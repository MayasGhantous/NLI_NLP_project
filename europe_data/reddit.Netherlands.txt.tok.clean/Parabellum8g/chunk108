  obviously , that part of legislation is deeply intertwined with ethical considerations : a parent that can completely disinherit a child is a parent that is likely driven by revenge or other malicious motivations , and you could argue that should not be rewarded . 
  on the other side you could say there should be an exception for children that have a history in misspending money , something that could be used after a decent legal framework has been created to determine when it should apply in the first place . 
  edit : here 's a [ link ] ( http://wetten.overheid.nl/bwbr0002761/2015-08-17 ) you could use . 
  then again , this victory [ feels like this ] ( https://youtu.be/pfcd4zotvg4?t=166 ) ( replace canada/canadian with britain/british person ) . 
  cameron as predicted only was granted some victories on details , while the main pillars beneath the eu - as well as britain 's current obligations - are almost untouched . 
  * guys , can you make it look like you 're giving him a lot ? 
  * * sure , i believe we can do that *, 
  yeah , that is not going to fit : before you know it belgium will invade us for ` lebensraum ' . 
  but knowing the demographic make up of the larger belgian cities i ca n't really be surprised . 
  sigh , your tone really is beyond any shame . 
  just to respond to a few things , besides the numerous insults , in the terrible rant above :  the interest and royalty directive , a large scale construction only i was n't talking about that , but about tax avoidance in general . 
  that is mistake 1 . 
   you 're right , let 's abolish attorneys altogether , nobody should be allowed to have legal representation in courts , a faulty comparison : a lawyer will always be necessary to safeguard the rights of civilians , not to mention that becoming a lawyer is subject to stricter oversight . 
  also , there is no call to ` outlaw ' the profession of tax adviser : next to it being nearly impossible , it would infringe on the position of non-state parties ( i.e. , the taxpayer ) when a difference of opinion would come into existence about whether enough taxes have been payed . 
   what 's in the law , is good . 
  what is not allowed by law is bad . 
  hart would be proud . 
   the only way eu can affect tax law , is through unanimous decision by every member state , all 28 member states of the european union . 
  specifically any fiscal measure must be made unanimously yawn , you are talking about changing the treaties . 
  guess what : yours truly was n't talking about treaty change , but about secondary legislation . 
  moreover : the feature creep of the eu treaties the uk for example is so afraid of . 
  the same feature creep that is currently empowering the commission to take action . 
   please . 
  education . 
  you 're an embarrasment thank you , but i already completed one in law . 
  i am starting to wonder what your credentials are , given the highly misplaced and immature response above . 
  but do n't bother : i wo n't even waste any time on you anymore . 
  now be a good boy and calm down !, 
  i 'm saying that the mores of society x do not necessarily always overlap with the laws of that same society . 
  allow me to give an example : murder and rape are two grave crimes that are not allowed , not in a moral sense ( there is severe societal resistance to it ) and not in a legal sense . 
  many present day laws find their roots in prevailing morals , yet this is not always the case . 
  when the law runs counter to what is just from an ethical point of view , combined with the fact that there is little support for such legislation among the people , then there should at least be a consideration to change the legal reality . 
  and in the end , when push comes to shove , i will prefer natural law over rigid legal positivism when the most important interests of society are at stake . 
  however , in this case , the law should just be changed . 
  wait , wait , let me get this straight : the fact that ** we ** do n't properly tax international companies that use the netherlands as a loophole in the first place , but that there 's a possibility that another country will do it for us , clears us of all blame ? 
  it works both ways , and negligence does not vindicate one of blame . 
  i always wonder what moral gymnastics one has to commit to keep on justifying these practices . 
  and do n't start about the treaty network : i already stipulated this above in another comment . 
  the main reason i did n't pursue a career as a tax advisor is because of the disgusting practices they tend to pursue when it comes down to these large scale constructions - to the detriment of society as a whole . 
  i can remember one of my former instructors commenting on it during a lesson of fiscal ethics : ` actually , we tax advisers add jack shit to society ' . 
  how right he was in hindsight : his words were proven to be right as time passed on . 
  but ok , we wo n't agree as you seem to have a very flexible interpretation of what is good and wrong , but do you think this situation will last ? 
  i guess the big 4 its lobby will be working at full power again in the background to prevent any change in ( eu ) legislation , but what is your take at it ? 
   the netherlands is not a tax haven nor is it a tax paradise having above average of this subject myself i really wonder how the hell you can come to that conclusion - at all . 
  is it just legally inspired , that being that you reason ` well it 's legal , so it 's ok ' ? 
  i have great difficulty seeing how facilitating mass tax avoidance by multinational companies - which in turn only get subjected to neglible amounts of taxation - is morally justified . 
  defend this disgusting practice any way you want , but please refrain from saying ` the netherlands is not a tax haven nor it is a tax paradise ' . 
  just be honest and do n't protect this shameful practice : it taints our reputation beyond measure - and it has to stop today instead of tomorrow . 
  having studied fiscal law in the past , the main problem at hand here is n't just discrepancy between taxation systems ( even though a uniform taxation system would very much curb this behavior ) : it has a lot to do with the extensive tax treaty network the netherlands maintains with other countries . 
  the netherlands is a hub in this entire worldwide scheme of tax avoidance due to its lax and cooperative rules on the matter , not to mention the political factor at play : i can still vividly remember junior minister wiebes commenting on this situation by saying that ` the netherlands are n't a tax haven ' . 
  a reasonable person ** can not ** come to that conclusion if you know how it works - and a top government official ( with sufficient knowledge himself ) knows better than that . 
  curbing it demands international cooperation . 
  sadly enough , the chances of that being pulled off are getting slimmer as the economic crisis is getting further behind us ( and government budgets being easier to balance as of 2016 compared to 2012 for example ) . 
  this is not a question about whether it is legal or not , but whether it is moral or not . 
  and the latter is much more important than the former . 
  laws can be changed , but the unwritten rules of society already condemn these kinds of constructions . 
  good luck trying to explain this to the average taxpayer . 
  as always with news like this , i feel disgusted and ashamed for being dutch . 
  our government facilitates this , to great damage to taxpayers of other nations . 
  and what do we earn out of it ? 
  that 's the biggest joke of them all . 
  i wo n't even feel compelled to put in extra effort to give the ` proof ' you want , before you 'll shoot it down beforehand anyways . 
  notice how i just doubted your opinion , and not asked for tons of proof to back your opinion up myself ? 
  i sincerely dislike the entire shift in tone since this last comment , so there you have it : i wo n't respond any further . 
  you pretty much killed it by making your own opinion infallible and not even considering the failures of democracy - or to openly think about a better system . 
  because the latter was my only motivation here . 
  to remark on two more things before i 'm gone :  the nation is the people . 
  this is n't even in contradiction to what i said . 
  i stipulated that the nation is a ` shell ' that got little objective value . 
  the people behind it make up the nation ; the nation as an entity is abstract - and not human to start out with . 
   they have `` direct '' accountability , and thus `` direct '' responsibility . 
  again : what i tried to convey above is the legal principle that there should be no accountability without blame . 
  how can a person that is forced to operate on a person in difficult circumstances - without any prior medical knowledge - be held responsible if that person dies ? 
  that is the message here regarding direct democracy as well : a lack of sufficient knowledge leads to a lack of accountability . 
  not embracing that fact of life is the fatal flaw in your thinking here . 
  but as said , this is done . 
  we will not agree on anything here . 
  proof about the doubtworthy role of the media , or proof about referendums that failed ? 
  if you really want me to dive into national referendums of every eu member state as well as the us , and cherrypick those i like , then i could do that . 
  a famous example would already be the ridiculous ` minaret ban ' , but there are more subjects that have also resulted in flawed verdicts by the people . 
  however , do n't conclude from the previous that i think the people should n't be able to decide in referendums . 
  referendums as an instrument should be limited though , to only the most obvious and far reaching of questions that directly and strongly influence the future of a people , instead of just going about stuff representatives ( and moreover , the experts that they ought to consult ) could solve . 
  the failures of representative democracy do not justify the failures of direct democracy : the first system should be updated with meritocratic elements , the second one should be used as a last measure at best . 
   well at least the responsible of the negative outcome for actions taken by the nation itself , will again be the nation itself . 
  the nation is just a bubble : responsible will be the people in the end . 
  and they do n't deserve such responsibility : no accountability without blame . 
  it 's hard to blame someone that is not competent to take a decision that was foisted upon him in the first place . 
  the limitations of democracy lie within those that are the ultimate deciders upon the policies of a democracy : the people itself . 
  democracy is perfect in guarding off tyranny , but much less so in making good policy . 
   that means , if the nation would go ahead and vote yes in a big majority after a discussion process , to the proposal of lowering the taxes 50 % , then that can only mean that they are just wanting that happen while being informed of the consequences of that proposal . 
  yes , and that is nothing but an assumption !, 
  the average person in this country at least is ill-informed - and i 'm 99 % sure that more or less applies to any country out there . 
  the average joe knows little stuff : he or she still is a good person , but his/her knowledge is pretty limited . 
  what lies at the root at your reasoning is that people will vote rationally and * will be * well informed . 
  plenty of referendums can be used to prove that certainly is far from always the case , not to mention the doubtworthy ( suggestive ) role of the media during such events . 
  call it a reflex belonging to the nanny state , but it is my clear conviction that the people should not have the right to destroy their prosperity and way of life in general . 
  and i fear that gap between our opinions can hardly be bridged , as it roots in principle . 
  but the ypg does outside of turkey - and as long as there is no independent verification on who perpetrated the bombing , it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion . 
  and even then the term ` war ' is probably still in place : after all we 've been ` at war ' with terrorism for a long time already . 
  the fact that entity x is a verified terrorist entity not holding any territory does not take away the term war .
