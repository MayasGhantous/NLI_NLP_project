  and as others already said in this thread : one man 's terrorist is the freedom fighter for another . 
  the bombing was cowardly , but as long as symmetrical warfare is not possible you will see attacks like this instead of armed insurgency . 
  it 's all there is left for factions like this . 
  alright , imagine this : next year the swiss citizenry decides that taxes will be lowered by 50 % . 
  i will be skipping the legal realities when making this example ( if i 'm not mistaken , such a referendum is not possible ) . 
  should the citizens of swiss for example be able to financially and economically ruin their country in such a way ? 
  after all , lowering taxes by 50 % will very likely bring about instability due to a smaller government . 
  that government will not be able to safeguard important rights and values due it having being weakened . 
  should a people be able to bring about its own ruin this way ? 
  or in some other way for that matter . 
  you seem to adhere to the traditional idea around democracy , that being that the people is the ultimate decisive factor . 
  the sum of all parts - that being the aggegrated opinion of all people that voiced their opinion through the ballot box - is not only seen as the ultimate will of the people ( this i do not doubt ) but also as * just by default * . 
  it 's the latter where our opinions differ considerably . 
  question : should a people be able to destroy itself ? 
  just answer it plain and simple , without venturing into unnecessary details . 
  i 'd like to hear your moral verdict on the matter . 
  it * could be * . 
  but there is a difference between keeping the option open and being convinced it is . 
  i 'm personally considering both scenarios , given the current government . 
  and with that in the back of my head , no nato country should support turkey if it would en masse move into syria now . 
  there is too much uncertainty : the situation is n't really transparant to say the least . 
  that is way too narrow of a definition , and probably legally not even sound . 
  remember [ article 5 ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm ? ) ? 
  it was invoked versus the terrorist entities behind the attacks of 9/11 , and not against a specified state in the beginning . 
  one can be at war with something else than a state , whether it be a revolutionary movement , some guerrilla group , etc. 
  as long as the other entity controls a reasonable amount of territory , it should be completely normal to speak of ` war ' , whether that entity has been recognized or not . 
  syria is a powder keg : all great powers should refrain from moving into that place , to prevent further escalation . 
  before you know it the conflict between russia and turkey ( that is still simmering in the background ) will completely get out of hand after another military incident , with others forced to intervene . 
  i 'm telling you : this got the potential to break up nato : few nato nations will come to turkey its aid if it wants to provoke russia even further ( despite russia provoking turkey as well ) . 
  just ignore the militias on the other side , guard the borders and keep a close eye on whatever develops in syria . 
  that ought to be enough given the circumstances . 
  a state of terror in the general public , or , option b , a state of terror in a group of persons or particular persons . 
  if that group of particular persons could be ` soldiers ' for example then it is a clear case of terrorism . 
  but yeah , i agree this is probably a response to turkey its small scale interventions outside its own borders . 
  a cowardly act it is still however , no matter what policies erdogan pursues . 
   the most we can do is beat the russian forces in syria which is quite meager after that we would get fucked by russia unless our big brother agrees to help which is why akp is trying to get them join with us . 
  yeah , and do n't you forget that no single nation in nato will ever approve of that . 
  turkey should not drag ** other nato member states ** into a war with it - especially if the cause of that war is partly self inflicted . 
  let it be clear that there is close to no support for such a war among the people in the netherlands , or any surrounding country here . 
  that 's actually a good point , even though you will get downvoted to hell about it . 
  it of course is strongly related to the ` definition ' of terrorism , however let that piece of terminology just be subject to the most arbitrary of interpretations in the mainstream media . 
  it all depends on whether the attack could be perceived as ` terrorist ' or just another combatant action . 
  the unsc definition is :  `` criminal acts , including against civilians , committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury , or taking of hostages , with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons , intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act , which constitute offences within the scope of and as defined in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism , are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature , '' might be difficult , but we 're talking semantics anyways . 
  it 's a sad thing for the victims , as they had no part in the policies of the ruling ak party . 
  ** edit : ** just to be plain , i condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms . 
  but the situation is n't really clear cut , since there was a clear government target . 
  your regular civilian was n't targetted , even though that does n't make it ` justified ' . 
  never read any of such comments before on / r/europe , so i 'm a bit surprised about that ` you deserved it ' example . 
  criticism on erdogan his government is leagues away from ( implicitly ) condoning ( terrorist ) bombings in my view - and i take it that the people responding here understand that as well . 
  singapore is one . 
  although singapore is hardly the ` ideal ' meritocracy . 
  the thing with referendums is that you entrust the people with making a verdict about often ( very ) complicated material , something they are in general not able to do . 
  as you kindly confirmed : the media at that point tend to take over the role and act as the sole distributor of what is ` right ' and what is ` wrong ' during referendum x. 
  of course , multiple media outlets will probably have different opinions on the matter ( depending on political alignment ) but it just bothers me that whatever is best for everyone is not the main goal at all times . 
  as you might think now : but we do the same during elections !, 
  that 's because elections are there mainly ( in my view ) to prevent tyranny , not to bring about the best policies . 
  in short , elections are a necessary evil to prevent worse . 
  i know that swiss democracy is n't a system that is bankrupt or in some other sense a disaster . 
  but i want to highlight that it is n't perfect - and that everyone should be open to thinking about better alternatives that truly maximize everyone 's wellbeing , including the general standard of living . 
  at some point we will be forced to re-evaluate democracy ( depending on external factors , between 1 and 3 generations time or so ) and decide on what we will do away in favor of ensuring our future . 
  whatever it is , a shift to a more autocratic system is to be expected - given the increasing competition from other countries where rules can be changed with the stroke of a pen . 
  in the meanwhile , we are still lagging behind and endlessly debating ` the right course of action ' , of course all interwoven with political goals . 
  i think swiss its strong position in europe is mainly the result of having an exceptionally strong financial sector ( even though that is dwindling ) together with a strong and down to earth people that built their country as it all unfolded . 
  to give direct democracy the pivotal role in achieving that is a bit easy , but that 's just me . 
  neither is more preferable at this point : both are flawed . 
  the form you named is susceptible to many flaws , including those you named . 
  direct democracy is basically run by the media and who can shout the hardest - and the enunciation of truth is not the main goal during referendums , especially those that deal with ` hot ' topics . 
  the best system as of 2016 would be a democracy interwoven with heavy elements of meritocracy - to prevent bad ideas from being realized into government policy . 
  in short , that does constitute a move towards more autocracy - but given how democracy seems to be slowly but surely failing on a meta scale we should at least give it some thought . 
  it can be done , given that certain prerequisites will be met beforehand . 
   i do n't think direct democracy is embarassing . 
  it can be on occassion . 
  the opinion of the people is n't some holy verdict that is * always right * . 
  dump that idea - and accept that the people are often even more flawed than those that lead them . 
  initiatives as outlined ( at least concerning the speeding part ) above are one of the main reasons why i am shifting further and further away from direct democracy . 
  heh , i like the comparison . 
  singapore is every authoritarian 's example from multiple points of view , although i do n't necessarily dislike it because of it . 
  those equal conditions being ? 
  come on , now you need to get a bit more precise . 
  watch out , you have the wrong flair for this kind of criticism !, 
   however , the cross-party procedure committee recommended in december that the rules should be scrapped to bring mps ' rights into line with those of other citizens , who are not automatically named on arrest . 
  this line of reasoning is understandable , but i fear the goal here is n't equality before the law but self preservation . 
  politicians need to be transparant about a great deal of things since they have far reaching powers and influence , therefore this is rather a bad idea instead of a good idea . 
  unless you 're deadset on believing that a politican is like ` your average citizen ' which he or she is not , by default . 
  because their numbers have been wildly exaggerated from the start onwards ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i seriously dislike those types , but behind this comment lies the completely faulty premise that there are millions of them . 
  there are not . 
  nothing 's better than a fiery redhead . 
  time to move to france or ireland . 
  best i saw were the vague contoures of the milky way : i could clearly distinguish a ` band ' in the air , but as said it was n't that pronounced . 
  and that was under near perfect conditions ( crisp clear sky in summer , with no moon ) in a distant yellow area ( probably closer to blue due to it being on the remote countryside ) . 
  [ there you go ] ( http://astropix.nl/limiting%20magnitude%20loss%20map.jpg ) . 
  everything that is lit up on this map is basically a no go area if you want to properly gaze upon the stars . 
  i 've seen the milkyway vaguely once ( i live on the countryside ) and that was under perfect circumstances : no moon , very little lighting nearby , in the middle of a nearby forest . 
  it really was beautiful . 
  i agree : everyone should see it once in a while . 
  so far i 've only vaguely once seen the contoures of the milky way ( already fascinating !, 
  ) , but for a few years already i 've been planning a trip to some dark place in france or scandinavia , far away from any major city , to see the milky way in full . 
  the netherlands is rather small and if you really want to see the milky way here you 're kind of forced to either go to the middle of nowhere somewhere in the eastern parts of the netherlands , or , even better , to visit the frisian islands . 
  feel blessed with the large unspoilt areas one can find in the us : we can hardly say the same anymore when it comes down to subjects as these .
