  taking control of vital points of the energy infrastructure , such as oil refineries . 
  i do n't want that kind of nonsense to happen over here ; stuff that is criminal by default . 
  well done !, 
  steps should be taken in every european nation to get rid of the fastfood lobby and start imposing some real taxation on bad food . 
  the gains of such a tax should be used to make fruit and vegetables for example cheaper . 
  it is in everyone 's interest that people remain in good condition , whether you look at it from an economical , medical or psychological point of view . 
  well , at least we embrace the notion of efficiency , something that the belgian state still has to prove  . 
  but indeed , we would be better off with bread that does n't fit in a bag as well as paralyzing , national strikes whenever we would try to reform something . 
  for what it is worth : i noticed that some people are apparantly downvoting you . 
  it was not me : i do consider your point of view defendable , therefore i do n't get why people are doing this . 
  still as of recent ? 
  i know that hamas was elected with overwhelming majority , but after two devastating wars the situation might as well be completely different . 
  then there 's the issue of control : there is no freedom of speech under the hamas administration whenever any given opinion goes agains hamas its view . 
  let us not just conclude that ` the palestinians ' as group are all thirsting for blood . 
  that would not give credit to the actual situation . 
   i realize this is unpopular opinion here but shit , a way to get stately status is not to bomb and wage war . 
  i agree . 
  i urge you however to make a difference between the west bank and the gaza strip . 
  first and foremost , i want to start with this :  i understand those weened on leftist media often believe the palestinian 'cause ' is righteous and the palestinians are the underdog somehow but history has taught me otherwise . 
  any and all progress toward peace , reconciliation , two-state solution comes from the west or israel politics or the large liberal israeli community , it will only be reached when hamas is out of the equation . 
  before you get the wrong impression : i 'm not leftist , as much as a complete misnomer the left/right divide is . 
  second of all , this type of rhetoric completely reminds me of some of the more extreme opinions we see on some corners of the internet , including geenstijl . 
  i take it that you do not belong to such a group , otherwise i fear ( out of direct experience ) that we are done talking . 
  liberal parts of israeli society aside : the current administration is far from liberal and that is all the matters at this point . 
  hamas might be sabotaging the two state solution , by striving to destroy israel , but so has israel with its stance to not recognize palestine . 
  also , and i find it important to remind you of this , israel its own founding is drenched in blood and gets close to what we call conquest . 
  if you really want to deny that hundreds of thousands , of not millions , of people living in the area of present day israel were driven away you will find yourself on a really slippery slope . 
   again , israel in majority of those cases needs to react fast to a sudden guerilla attack in the vicinity of a un complex , simple question back : was there direct danger to israeli soldiers and even if so , does that legitimise the attacking of schools that harbor civilians , also known as non-combatants ? 
  second , how does this relate to the geneva conventions ? 
   to my knowledge 3 schools were hit , some schools contained stockpiles of rockets . 
  completely true , but that does not take away the non-combatant status of civilians , how difficult that might be in times of war . 
  a weapon stockpile also does not create a direct threat . 
  maybe an indirect one , but that is something else . 
   so thirsty israel waited for days , enacted several negotiations and attempted several ceasefires which were promptly put down because hamas of course does it all for the attention , despite the failure of the terrorist organisation of hamas to show willingness for a peaceful ceasefire , that again does not mean that schools are fair game . 
  there is a discreet line that can not be crossed in terms of war and whatever way you want to put it : civilians * can not * and i repeat , ** can not ** be subjected to violent retaliatory action . 
  the entire discussion was not about reacting to hamas missile fire ( which is reasonable of course ) , but the way how civilians were subject to indiscriminate violence . 
   is war now a monty python sketch wherein each side needs 50 % 50 % casualties for '' fairness '' ? 
  fair point as well . 
  i 've really asked myself if the large discrepancy between deaths ( about 70 vs 2200 ) does say something about proportionality of violence . 
  i tend to say ` yes ' , as those numbers do say something about which side is more professional and therefore needs to act more cautiously . 
  it might indeed sound bizar , but this type of discrepancy can indeed make a difference . 
   you realize this conflict is relatively compared one of the most '' peaceful '' when you look at the timeline , asymmetrical nature and urban surrounding , amount of civilians that have died ? 
  limiting civilian casualities is not enough if such military plans still cause a lot of suffering among the civilian populace . 
  now , i 'm not stupid in this regard : i know that the gaza strip is a densely populated area , so chances are that collateral damage will indeed have grave consequences . 
  that * again * does not mean that everything is fair game , especially if there are serious concerns about such collateral damage . 
  i consider about 1200 + civilian deaths an operational failure for a sophisticated army such as the idf . 
  but that 's my opinion , and many will disagree with me on that . 
   and hamas and co will just dissolve ? 
  just dissolve ? 
  no , sadly this scum will not immediatly dissolve . 
  as long as they receive backing from the populace ( how small that backing might even be after all this destruction ) , hamas will survive . 
  let us just wait for the upcoming elections and see how hamas ` performs ' there . 
  for now , i believe that there should be a partial recognition , that is the recognition of the west bank . 
  as long as hamas indeed keeps ruling in the gaza strip , there should be no recognition of this territory . 
  it might surprise you that i actually took part in a mock arbitrary panel * regarding this issue * . 
  the panel pretty much had to conclude that israel can only keep up the ` necessity ' of that attack if it were to completely blame hamas for everything . 
  basically : the part of the panel that was ` israeli ' had to shift all the blame to hamas , otherwise any defense in that matter would fail . 
  those schools were targeted because , according to israeli intelligence ( and i urge you to back down here a bit , as we really do not know for sure ) there was hamas activity near those schools . 
  that however does not give the idf carte blanche to bombard schools , schools to which the israeli government knew were being used as schelters . 
  some of those u.n. schools were actually harboring thousands of people , and many lives were put on the line for the thirst for revenge . 
   undoubtedly damage also done by hamas with rocket barrage misfires , israel does take out these systems and hamas terrorists in the city where they hole up . 
  that 's the pickle : iron dome prevents qassam missiles ( how criminal the launch of those missiles might be ) from actually causing havoc within israeli borders . 
  the statistics speak for themselves : missiles shot from the gaza strip rarely succeed in actually killing someone . 
  does that mean that israel can not respond ? 
  of course not , but the question is ** how ** israel should respond and to what extend a response is ** proportional ** . 
   not too sure about that , might be around 50 % . 
  maybe : reports differ on this point . 
  the idf [ apparantly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_israel%e2%80%93gaza_conflict ) says 55 % , although the local authorities have provided different numbers . 
  terminology aside : a lot of civilians were killed , way more than should be allowed . 
   what is israel to do ? 
  engage in peaceful negotiations with the palestinians . 
  by that i mean accepting the two-state solution and no further acts of aggression ( i.e. 
  building more colonies on the west bank ) . 
  as long as israel keeps this image as a boogyman , the hordes of youth that want to become ' a martyr ' will keep seeing justification for their cause . 
  and yes , before you even start about it : hamas should be eradicated . 
  problem is , and here reality sets in , the current military approach just does not work . 
  hamas can be contained at best , to great suffering of the civilian populace in the gaza strip . 
  holy shit indeed . 
  such a divide that this picture shows . 
  yeah indeed , that 's how it goes just a bit too often . 
  i would be ashamed to use that argument to ad absurdum , but apparantly israel is beyond shame . 
  the current system as we see it in russia as of present runs contrary to how ` we ' go about furnishing a state and its institutions . 
  that 's why i called the systems , not the people though , arch-enemies of one another . 
  i do understand and acknowledge that the eu has indeed been meddling into ukraine , but so did russia probably even before brussels set its gaze upon kiev . 
  what i consider crucial during these type of discussions - and russians apparantly fail to see that in overwhelming numbers - is that * not a single * eu or nato memberstate was * forced * to become part of those organisations . 
  they all made their own , sovereign choices in that matter and that should be respected . 
  enter russia , that wants to reinstate its power over the old soviet sphere of influence by other means . 
  means that really run counter to peaceful negotations and other tactics that the eu and nato for example employ . 
  plans for a defensive war i take it . 
  even if nato - and that is a big ` if ' - has plans to take on russia in a very pre-1945 manner of way such a move would fail on the political side . 
  russia on the other hand might really be considering aggressive , first-strike plans here . 
  i do n't see nato waltsing into another country without a proper invite . 
  oh , just to emphasize that belgium can hardly be called a state given the internal divide that has been going on there for quite a long time already . 
  i mean : the flemish separatist movement nva for example is part of the new administration . 
  something like [ this ? 
  ] ( http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120704153132/gundam/images/4/4f/oz-09mms_pisces.jpg ) who knows , maybe russia will actually be the first nation to create gundams or something like it lol . 
  good to hear  . 
  a very typical reaction that fits in with the current israeli administration . 
  given the response , ireland must take pride in the fact that israel * apparantly * felt so cornered that such a response was necessary . 
  hamas might be terrorist , but that does not bombard every palestinian to the status of terrorist as well .
