  still kudos for remarking on it . 
  i noticed it earlier on and just did n't care about it anyways : moderates have long left this place - and anything that does n't serve the circlejerk will be heavily downvoted . 
  thanks for contributing where so many others feel inclined to do the opposite . 
  because it is n't convenient . 
  that 's the malicious part at play here : a kid became victim of a horrible crime , but before you know it someone will already exploit it for political gain . 
  they turn one case into a statistic of its own and use it to give a binding verdict about an entire group of people . 
  i do n't want any refugee or migrant in europe : i think we 'd be better off by taking care of them in region and that 's where our proririties should lie . 
  but to get rid of them this way will not work : it 'll only result in a long tedious battle about what statistical value crime a got , that in turn will probably result in the left winning it anyways - effectively giving them more ammunition against those that are against the current influx . 
  that 's the sad part , and that 's why nobody should use a case like this as a main argument against immigration . 
  i 'm telling this because that 's the direction the public debate seems to be moving in . 
  it is self defeating in itself . 
  that is kind of dodging the pickle here : how would an anarchist society come into existence otherwise ? 
  people that unconditionally believe in anarchism and want to see it realized will at some point have to embrace the reality it will not happen by democratic means . 
  thus the distinction between your average salon anarchist and hardcore anarchists . 
   no , it 's not . 
  the premise is that the eurozone will increasingly unite and often vote together , with any disagreements within the eurozone being determined before it gets to that stage . 
  in those situations , a decision already agreed by eurozone members will be inflicted on the uk with the uk not being able to do anything to stop it except ask nicely . 
  whether the eurozone or not will vote more cohesively in the future is still of no importance . 
  you underlined again that there are major differences between the uk and ` the continent ' , how obvious that may already be by now . 
  you notice it between the uk and france , the uk and germany , and so forth : there are large differences about the view on what the eu ` should be ' ( whether now or in the future ) and that is the root cause of disagreement here . 
  a somber thing it is , but at some point it might be best to acknowledge that we 've grown too far apart from one another by now . 
  the eu will probably be required to develop further onwards into future , including military integration , and there is no desire for further entities that will sabotage or stall that process when that time would arrive . 
   if the uk public had been asked , as was promised to them , the lisbon treaty would have been voted down and we would still have a veto in most of these areas . 
  i think your leaders back then had the failed referendum in the netherlands in mind ( where the people voted overwhelmingly against ) . 
  ` we ' pushed it through anyways with lasting damage between the dutch people and politicians . 
  the effects of that are still rippling through into 2016 , especially with the upcoming ` advisory ` referendum about the ukraine association treaty . 
   but those competences are now extremely broad , especially on matters of economics and immigration , which are the two issues most of concern to the british public . 
  we agree on that . 
  yet still : this was what britain signed up for . 
  in the case of the internal market/competition law those competences are arguably justified , as the eu needs far reaching powers to achieve and maintain it . 
  but in other fields the eu its powers indeed go rather broad without a clear goal in sight . 
   it does n't matter if the uk is in the council and parliament because the eurozone has a qualified majority on its own . 
  the premise underlying this comment is that the eurozone will always vote as one cohesive whole . 
  i think that is far from proven , nor could one look at this loosely organised bloc as its own independent entity within the eu power structure . 
  what is really beneath this complaint is the fact that ` the continent ' ( sad that we have to call it that ) tends to disagree with the uk more often , and that 's something else . 
   this is just fundamentally untrue . 
  the eu has swathes of competences with qmv across areas such as business regulation , self-employment legislation , transport , culture , structural funds , freedom of movement , social security , energy , citizens initiatives , sport , tourism , civil protection , and regional policy . 
  i think / u/silverionmox wanted to add that the eu can do nothing * unless * it has been given a competence ( that flows forth out of the treaties ) in a certain area . 
  therefore the power of the eu is ` limited ' , as it can not create its own competences ( [ kompetenz-kompetenz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kompetenz-kompetenz ) ) . 
  this idea that the eu can ` do whatever it wants ' is an often recurring myth as all those powers are based on the treaties signed by all current member states , including the uk . 
  everything that is happening today is the result of past agreements . 
  the uk should really take a good look in the mirror first before criticizing what they signed up for in the first place . 
  mind you : the uk has the fullest right to leave if it wants to ( the exit clause in the teu provides for that ) . 
  i do not contradict that right , but rather the hypocrisy that constantly seems to surround this debate . 
  edit : grammar, 
   get back control of their borders with all respect , the uk already got this from many points of view . 
  it 's just that the freedom of movement is something that is shared among all people in the eu , and works in any direction . 
  the fact that it does n't favor the uk does n't necessarily mean that it is a ` bad thing ' , even though the uk should indeed be given the necessary powers to prevent said people from leeching on their own social service system . 
  i 'm always stunned to see how exaggerated the eu its influence and impact are in the uk ( you can also see it all across this topic again ) - while at the same time often fully misportraying the system of internal decision making in the eu itself . 
  not to mention the hypocrisy : britain signed the current treaties , that includes qmv on a whole range of subjects . 
  the same treaties that also have an exit clause the uk can ** use ** to end it all . 
  no disadvantages anymore , but certainly no more benefits . 
  agreed about the corruption part . 
  therefore sufficient legal oversight will be required to make sure any funds will be well spent . 
  the smartest strategy of them all would be not to send ` cash ' but personnel , medications , food and materials . 
  that would make it more expensive though , but for the early phase that is probably required anyways . 
  there are no northern europeans in the sense of an ethnic cohesive group that shares the same beliefs . 
  making such a statement immediatly invalidates whatever follows after it . 
  we are not that different - and if you really want to compare ` moral compasses ' - you should certainly draw the comparison between the iberian peninsula and the netherlands . 
  it is pretty clear who is willing to take in more people if you want to look at it from that angle . 
  thanks for the stats . 
  even though that number is spread out over two years : imagine what one could do for people that are in desperate need * in the region * . 
  by helping a million refugees/migrants here , millions others that could 've been helped with the same amount of money will be left out in the cold . 
  in short , it is money misspent . 
  there is ** no ** moral superiority to be recognized in executing such policy . 
  it rather is detrimental in the wider scope of things . 
  indeed . 
  they rather invest more money in [ net throwing drones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbwwrsloz5q&amp;feature=youtu.be ) , although it is not weird that they explore all the options available . 
  after all , birds of prey are pretty quick ( much quicker than drones i 'd say ) making it a worthwhile attempt . 
  does n't the us by the way still drain dolphins for military purposes  ? 
  calling in assistance . 
  chasing by vehicle . 
  using a taser . 
  using those neat net shooting weapons . 
  see , it is n't that hard . 
  no need to give in to that primal and uncivilized desire to kill without proper justification . 
  here they 're trained to shoot at the legs and arms/shoulders . 
  an officer here is only allowed to shoot at the torso or head if his life is objectively in clear and present danger . 
  he 's hopelessly seeking for a way to incriminate the other party in this case . 
  his tu quoque was rather flawed however , so he failed . 
  although i 'll admit the media did spin the words already into a ` shoot refugees ' message ( edit : they did here in the netherlands ) . 
  personally i disagree with the statement : there are other , less severe methods to stop trespassers . 
  ** edit : ** ah there 's the downvote brigade again . 
  go ahead : there are plenty of you here anyways already . 
  i 'm not going to silence myself just because a bunch of neckbeards prefer that to happen . 
   hopefully that is the ` line of thought ' you mean , meaning we should want to improve our political system . 
  i think that is what it mostly boils down to : an urge to improve what is broken and above all , willingness to take necessary action to make it reality . 
  i have nothing against the people choosing its leaders : my problem is limited to those who stand for office and their capabilities in the first place . 
  there is something to be said about democracy being a bad idea long term . 
  our extensive decision making process is increasingly being sidelined by the rule by decree of countries like china , resulting in falling further behind . 
  in the end , i think the happiness of a people should be measured by who their rights are respected and how much means they have at their disposal to live a good life . 
  even an autocratic system can theoretically maximize both ( singapore comes close to that idea ) , but it 's very difficult . 
  if you only use human rights as a measure , and not economic progress and other factors , then i understand you can come to the conclusion that democracy is ` demonstrably almost always better ' . 
  we will disagree here because of it : i do n't think it 's that simple . 
  the western world has been the centre of power for a long time already , yet we should n't give that away because we fail to get our own internal legislative processes in proper and efficient working order . 
  not much . 
  one of the largest asylum processing centers of the netherlands is located in my municipality and basically the same as what other dutch people here described . 
  you regularly see them walking to the local supermarkt in large streams - and the syrians especially are just the middle class of their respective country . 
  it shows : they 're pretty normal people . 
  we had no incidents so far at all , save a one time fight on the premises which the police ended .
