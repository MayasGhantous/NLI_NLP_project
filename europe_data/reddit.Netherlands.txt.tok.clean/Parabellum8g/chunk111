  except that one moment it has been quiet here , and the impact on daily life is extremely limited . 
  that however said , that does n't make me a proponent of the current system , although i will remark that i have nothing against the refugees that come here . 
  edit : might have said that immediatly after all . 
  that makes it all the more clear . 
  interesting to cross swords with someone that 's actually well informed for a change . 
  i do not say that i agree with all of it , but you did convincingly demonstrate the dangers of such a system by basing it one * possibly * fatal flaw . 
  how flawed such a system will be will vary according to the context in which it can exist , but would you agree with me that the 21st century brings forth more options to actually * make it work * long term ? 
  just like the communist states of old a system like this demands a complicated state apparatus , with plenty of room for shady deals and lack of oversight ( although , lets be honest , democracy has the same issues save some of the complexity ) . 
  i 'd say the time has come to try a new complex system based on our increased knowledge and experience as of 2016 - at least try - to see if it could actually work . 
  but maybe you 're right , even though it goes without much saying that democracies can not last forever in turn . 
  just look at the us that is slowly falling victim to the fate of the old roman republic ( plutocracy ) and other nations where a whole new closed ruling class with strong party connections has come into existence . 
  once those are firmly entrenched , the incentive for improvement will not unlikely drastically decrease in favor of self preservation . 
  or , as a last question ( we have to end it at some point , hah !, 
  ) , do you think democracy will still last for many generations to come ? 
  it is important that those systems were in place in drastically different times , with much less eye for human rights . 
  the droit divine in itself was more of a religious concept instead of a meritocratic one : the right after all was god given and * therefore * beyond question . 
  to call that meritocratic - even though i admit that the definition of merit is subject to ` interpretation ' - is similar to moving the goalposts . 
  also , would stalinist russia have selected would be candidates for high political office if their views were n't completely in line with bolsjevik doctrine ? 
  call it what you want , but the failure that was stalinist russia ( or stalinist north korea in that regard ) was hardly meritocratic * due * to the way the state apparatus took form in practice . 
  i do not discard the ideas you put forward , yet that is not how it fully worked in practice . 
   once you have power to select the `` experts '' you want to be the gatekeepers , you control who gets selected as viable candidates . 
  until the people recall you , via democratic means . 
  that power of what ` merit ' means is not exclusive among the elite , nor will it necessarily lead to a gliding scale again . 
  there is a mechanism in place to prevent that , nor do you view in on any legislation that would protect the people against something like that happening . 
  or moreover , what was completely absent in your rant : what about the judiciary ? 
  why would they not act as another safeguard in this system ? 
  a judiciary that can strike laws that are against the common interests of the people is a powerful counterbalance to that risk . 
   so like in the soviet union , or china , or cuba , or ddr , all of which had systems for the people to actually vote to various extents , either in public elections or through the party structures , from a set of candidates that were/are all vetted by `` experts '' . 
  again , other times , other context , not to mention that all these states were first and foremost drenched in communist doctrine . 
  my view on meritocracy is that it certainly should not lead to the end of political parties ( a one party system is undesirable after all ) . 
  in short i reject the notion that it is dictatorship , unless you want to claim that rule by the wise ( and the exclusion of rule by those that are n't able to do so ) again inherently constitutes dictatorship . 
  dictatorship is far more than who 's in power , and above all dictatorship in practice refers to rule concentrated in one person . 
  as pointed out numerous time in this comment section already : that is not how it works in practice . 
  you 'd rather call it autocratic then , with strong technocratic tendencies , instead of dictatorial . 
  if you conclude that all other systems must inherently lead to corruption , dicatorship and human rights violations , that is indeed the only logical conclusion . 
  doing so beforehand , without even trying to think it through in the first place , is hardly something that commands respect or admiration . 
  basically , your statement is rather absolutist . 
  ` it 's just that every other system has much bigger flaws ' . 
  as if it 's an indisputable fact and that stings the most of all . 
  i have no idea why you insert that stalinist anecdote , but lets just suffice with saying that i do not share those ideas . 
  i genuinely want to see humanity advance , without failing and inadequate systems of government . 
  nothing should be put beyond argument : if a system is good enough in itself it could be protected by valid arguments , but democracy is surprisingly weak when you attack it for how it works in practice . 
  there is no point in fighting for something that is inherently broken in the long term - and there should be no special attachment to it at all . 
  democracy is in that sense one of the last untouchable subjects out there , at least in a mainstream sense . 
  i think you inherently conclude that a meritocratic system * must * lead to dictatorship ( a fault many people made in this post when commenting on meritocracy ) . 
  nepotism and corruption , while good legislation and sufficient democracy would still prevent that . 
  the people would still choose its leaders , only the leaders that would be ` capable ' to lead would be selected beforehand by experts . 
  that may sound scary in the ears of some , but i 'm at least willing to try out such a system provided that it would have a strong legal framework that would prevent abuse . 
  who are we to turn to for numbers then ? 
  that is the thing : there are so many extreme differences between all the guesstimates out there that apparantly no one can be trusted , including the people that claim ' 80 % ' migrants or the ones that do the reverse ( 80 % or more are refugees ) . 
  whatever it is , the estimate above falls in the wide range of numbers out there already , yet still there is far from any consensus on the truth of the matter . 
  create a commission with experts from the field to decide on that ( and before you start about it : no that is not difficult ) . 
  let that commission grill the prospect politician on the most fine details of his career field as well as the requirements for the job - and see which one manages to be correct most of the time . 
  this person in turn would not be perfect ( therefore ` the best ' is rather distracting , and should not be used to describe meritocracy in practice ) , but * likely better * than others . 
  it 's all about diminishing risk that a new minister would fail or otherwise loose control . 
   how was their refugee status determined , and by whom ? 
  conjecture incoming . 
  i think that they 've identified them on the basis of passports ( not all migrants/refugees throw away their passports ) or on some other basis . 
  although i will add that this ` identification ' will be on a provisional basis , with the member states harboring these people ultimately deciding on the facts . 
  in each case : frontex seems to be the entity responsible for the rough data . 
  also interesting , out of the article :  leggeri said they arrived at their data by authenticating the individual backgrounds of the nationals . 
  some may claim to be syrian but are not , he said . 
  if the individual is not syrian then frontex assumes the person is an irregular migrant , unless a background check has been performed . 
  but maybe someone else besides us with some more ( preferably first hand ) knowledge about this subject can jump in ? 
  i agree with what you said about temporary asylum ( even though taking care of them in the region would still be better ) , but apparantly 90 % do classify as refugees . 
  that being : 90 % that entered greece until the date of the report above . 
  this is in sharp contrast with earlier figures ( up to 80 % being economic migrants/fortune seekers ) . 
  i think we should have little reason to doubt frontex , as they 're on top of this problem each and every day . 
  you base the contents of my entire comment on that one harsh categorisation ? 
  a bit unfair , though ` incompetent people ' or ` people unfit for their occupation ' would have been another , less adversial way of putting it . 
  but do me a favor and judge it on its contents if you are that deadset on being witty  . 
  just for the sake of clarity :  well there 's the ` no-confidence ' vote , parliament can ask a minister to step down , the pm can demand a minister to step down , in a presidential republic the president can ask the government to step down , and in parliamentary democracies a parliament can also vote for the complete government to step down . 
  the confidence rule applies to the representatives of the people , not the people themselves . 
  a recall is a mechanism where the people can ` vote ' someone out of office . 
  in the end , the replacement of failing politicians mid term is dependent on the parties that have most power - as well as their own political games . 
  i agree with the rest though . 
  it 's good to see this line of thought is getting more widespread : a few years ago it was much more difficult to attack the ` god given perfect system that is democracy ' . 
  it seems like more and more people have transcended beyond that response and are willing to actually evaluate how it functions altogether . 
  and he 's right about that comment regarding our system of government . 
  as a former soldier he thinks in giving ` the right orders ' , and therefore is striving towards better leadership and better spending of resources , whether material or human . 
  nobody should be surprised that a former soldier - the armed forces being far more meritocratic than your average employer - comes to such a conclusion . 
  he should be listened to as least as much as your regular politician . 
  so much this !, 
  i 'll repeat it again : ** democracy has created its own cult ** . 
  there is a nearly religious devotion to democracy among some people , with said people not being able or willing to see its flaws . 
  they have completely closed their minds for alternatives , in some views even calling democracy ` the final system of government ' . 
  we are the people that need to ensure society remains on track and that all our resources are well spent - something the incompentence that goes with democracy nowadays can not guarantee . 
  when the people closes their eyes and does n't even want to think about its leaders anymore , or more importantly , * how * they are being lead , then they 've walked themselves into servitude . 
  democratic or not , that makes it still terrible . 
  ** edit ** : downvote away boys , it does n't make democracy more credible . 
  if it is so superior , defend it with arguments instead of via the ` dislike ' button . 
  i 'm getting rather annoyed by this lazy argument , sorry for saying so . 
  people do not even take the effort to think about how such a system could be given shape and regard it as ` impossible ' beforehand . 
  strong legislation about selection that ensures that corruption , nepotism and other detrimental tendencies of such a system would be prevented should result in a stable , durable system of government . 
  the judiciary arguably needs to be strengthened ( as guardian of such a system ) as well as the entire system of checks and balances overall . 
  extreme punishments will need to be introduced for corruption , nepotism and comparable crimes , as well as clear selection guidelines . 
  i think we can turn for science to make sure who is fit to lead . 
  even then the system would n't be watertight , but at least it will be ** far ** less flawed than it is nowadays . 
  what we know for sure is that we wo n't find out as long as democracy in its current form keeps getting the benefit of the doubt . 
   some people argue that the biggest power of our democracy is not that we elect people to represent us , but rather that we can replace those who should not .
