  let us not overreact though : there is a lot that binds us - even you will agree to that - but the increasing divide has become painfully obvious . 
  then again : the eu has been the master at surviving severe crisis : when push comes to shove , the government leaders will close ranks anyways as we 've seen during the debt crisis . 
  but maybe increased cooperation between some western and southern european nations is the better course of action at this point . 
  if we can not bridge the divide because of fundamental overencompassing differences , it is best to pull the plug out of the entire thing . 
  we are n't there yet though and a dialogue will be necessary for times to come , until the limit has been reached . 
  i did , out of my own legal background . 
  do you have a legal background by any chance , or did you just google the quote above ? 
  because if we are to engage in selective shopping into the treaties , we could do this kind of thing for hours . 
  you should read the part about what competences ( i.e. , a legal term for ` powers ' ) the eu got in this situation , how qmv works and how measures need to be implemented . 
  pretty much the entire framework out there that ensures that measures decided on a european level need to be implemented in full . 
  if you do n't want to agree to measure x , and opt out will be required . 
  without and opt out , one can not complain . 
  after all : you signed for it yourself . 
  or would you say that is unreasonable ? 
  also , do n't be so aggressive . 
  you can disagree all you want , but a more constructive attitude would be welcome . 
   splendid , so you voted for idiots that will ruin the economy for social care that we ca n't afford because you are afraid of couple of thousand arabs ? 
  yeah , it 's an effect i noticed here as well . 
  people vote for the parties that propose ` tough ' measures , while said parties at the same time ensure that their wages will no longer increase ( or even halt ) and that social support will diminish even further . 
  it is ironic how a people can in that sense destroy their own wellbeing because of an obsession with one particular subject , even when it is an important one . 
  the effects on poland would 've been neglible at best ( the numbers would be really , really small on the total population ) yet some media succeeded in turning this into an overencompassing issue that made people change their voting behavior . 
  i mean : it 's not like poland would 've hauled in millions of them , and if you would 've spread them out evenly over the country they would have assimilated relatively quickly . 
  you can still be completely in favor of fully locking down the european border while still accepting such european obligations . 
  edit : for clarity , i 'm totally not in favor of the mechanism overall , but describing the results and obligations of it . 
  this is no endorsement for some kind of open border policy . 
  in weaker terms : the cultural divide between western europe and eastern/central europe is strongly showing during such issues . 
  i still believe there is more that connects us than there is to divide us , yet this massive cultural difference on topics like these ( that are enshrined in the teu/tfeu as well ) is alarming . 
  it menas that the governments in question should 've never signed the teu and the accompanying tfeu because there is arguably very little popular support for some of its provisions . 
  if you enter into a legal obligation you will be obliged to fulfill it in full . 
  if you do n't want to do x , you need to opt out for it or just not sign the entire thing ( including the provisions you do agree with ) at all . 
  about the term ` veto ' here : would n't such decisions again by subject to qmv ( qualified majority voting ) , as it was last time ? 
  if so , the ` veto ' of one country is arguably no veto , but just another country voting against . 
  would a subject dealing with about the same subject matter demand unanimity under eu legislation ? 
  this sounds a bit weird in my ears . 
  are you even reading ? 
  or at least let me give some basic legal background info . 
  inciting hatred has been punishable here for decades by now . 
  taking steps to punish it is n't new ( at all ) , but engaging in preventive measures , i.e. 
  the police pointing out that you should n't do x because you could prosecuted for it is . 
  the police of course works on instruction of the local public prosecutor . 
  to already point out a severe mistake : the om ( office of the public prosecutor ) is independent . 
  freedom of speech has never been absolute here , that 's why the constitutional provision about it here ends on ` in accordance with anyone 's responsibility towards the law ' . 
  meaning : freedom of speech does not apply when it has been purposely limited by the legislature . 
  an example would be slander ( that can really be destructive ) or inciting hatred . 
  what you immediatly assume - and i 'm fully convinced about it given this pavlov reflex - is that you ca n't voice opposition against the entire migrant influx . 
  your average person can do just that , in far reaching terms , as long as you keep it civil . 
  you 'll have zero issues if you were to say ` all asylum seekers ought to be deported back to their own countries because current policy is unfair and will lead to widespread societal turmoil ' . 
  if you in a heated discussion were to say ` that asylum centre needs to go , or else ... ' the situation is completely different . 
  people that ca n't keep it civil need to be treated as the children they are , especially if they 're starting an online riot . 
  i 'd rather live in a society where such actions are not tolerated , as tolerating it will hardly facilitate a good debate . 
  ` gender ideology ' . 
  i 'd laugh about such terminology if regular , innocent people would n't become victim to it . 
  this is another episode of that government that sends chills down my spine . 
  i wonder how people in poland will look back at this period 20-30 years from now . 
  if they arguably try to incite hatred or more importantly violence ? 
  absolutely , if only to make sure that those online ` heroes ' do n't enjoy impunity when they cross the line . 
  this is still one of the european nations where freedom of speech is the most far reaching , but calls for violence or inciting hatred are so pubescent and detrimental to society that they are being prosecuted for good reason . 
  and do n't tell me that the people that cry foul in the article did n't skirt the edges , as the majority of them did . 
  but the police should only come by someone 's house for questioning , not to ` advise ' someone that is n't a suspect yet . 
  he sure does . 
  even worse is the lack of carefulness and moreover the complete absence of any sense of shame when presenting such ` views ' . 
  when foreign nationals in large numbers get such ideas on so little or even no evidence or even first hand experience it surely is a sad day . 
  i 'm convinced close to 80 % of all commenters in this topic did n't read the translation , but only the heavily editorialized title . 
  sad there is so little self criticism among them : the urge to immediately assimilate the topic into ones own views instead of being willing to find out the truth of the matter is highly disturbing . 
  it does ? 
  maybe you should actually find the time to insert some more arguments , or at least some vague remarks on why what i said would be nonsense . 
  although i was also trolling a bit : i know that many of those types can not stand it to be told the truth , and thus will hit the downvote button out of sheer revenge  . 
  most people i 've met in my life that are * really * politically active have always been young guys . 
  the majority of them were single , and quite a few of them were socially completely handicapped - with a stable relationship being an impossible option out of their own character . 
  i 'm not really surprised about the recent survey results in that regard . 
  that is : if you understand that the comment above made a direct link to the recent survey results . 
  indeed !, 
  i can still remember that slow feeling of becoming ` aware ' how the world really works . 
  it 's a gradual process that lasts for the remainder of ones life , but it seems like the most important lessons in this regard are learned during adolescence . 
  those lessons can be sobering ( and depressing ) - and i 'd be lying if i denied having become much more cynical and far less idealistic ( to the point of almost no longer being idealistic at all ) after passing that phase . 
  they wo n't . 
  they ** want ** to be angry , and seek every small argument ( no matter how doubtworthy ) to convey that message . 
  these mostly young and single guys are just frustrated and have found some way to vent those frustrations . 
  i wonder if any [ young guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42fyy7/reurope_500k_subscribers_survey_the_results/ ) that suffers from a lack of sex is susceptible to such uncompromising saltyness . 
  on the other hand i 'm starting to believe idiots like senseiswag with their claims that ` there is no debate ' . 
  topics like these prove this is more and more the case . 
  i 'm completely and utterly opposed to the immigrant influx , but on a regular basis mostly find myself surrounded with idiots that ca n't even voice their opinion without making some severe mistake in reasoning - or more importantly people that know what they 're talking about in the first place . 
  it really sucks that the ` no ' side is so heavily dependent on the uneducated and shortsighted hordes out there . 
  i ask myself where all the moderates went . 
   no wonder , because your country is already run by a one happy conglomerate that shares the same opinions , where there 's no pluralism anymore and judges agree with the establishment where do you get these ideas ? 
  what do you even know of the netherlands to be frank ? 
  there are a shitload of differences between the vvd and the one hand and the pvda/gl/sp on the other for example . 
  the establishment is anything but a happy conglomerate , but terribly divided !, 
  it is not about opinions here . 
  it 's about implicitly or explicitly calling for violence : that 's why many of these persons were asked to reconsider what they said as an advice , because the great majority of them have no idea of the consequences . 
  foulmouthed people on social media that threathen with violence on a regular basis have become a real problem , and this pre-emptive approach fits in a way to curb it . 
  you probably only read the title and came to the conclusion that ` anti-immigration ' opinions were being ` censored ' . 
  nothing is further from the truth , thus i reinvite you to read the translation posted by some other dutch guy in the comment section . 
  read it ** thoroughly ** , and then come back to me . 
  again : it has nothing to do with ` suppressing ' opinions . 
  it got a lot more to do with people that ca n't voice their opinion in a grown up manner . 
  no , that requires us to bend our system of checks and balances in a much more dramatic way , for example by making the supreme court mostly powerless . 
  fortunately we have n't reached that level . 
  nor is the title of this article correct ( it is heavily editorialized ) - and you should read the translations posted here by dutch speaking persons . 
  then you 'll notice that something completely different is going on here than ` censoring ' unwanted opinions .
