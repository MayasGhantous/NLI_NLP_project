  ** edit : ** to all you trigger happy people , read the translation in the comments . 
  someone posted the full dutch translation . 
  if you read it , you 'll realize how heavily the title has been editorialized - and the context surrounding these ` visits ' . 
  i 'm not a big fan of the police coming by to talk with you about whatever verbal diarrhea you flung into the open again , but there is a gentle line to be observed here . 
  if someone makes implicit or explicit calls for violence , he or she could be prosecuted . 
  if you want the law on this point to be adjusted : argue against that , even though you 'll rather find yourself on the moral low ground if you want to defend calls for violence . 
  i 'm not saying the people in the newspaper article did so without any doubt , but some of them * sure made it look like * that was the case . 
  and most importantly , to the hordes of people that completely misinterpret this article ( and probably have n't even read it ) : this has ** nothing to do with censorship ** . 
  i do n't know if it really matters in this situation . 
  unless you 're a specialist in the field that is subject of debate , i do n't think being older makes that much of a difference . 
  maybe something , but i do n't see how a 21 year old student got * that much * more to add than a 31 year old person that is talking about something that transcends his / her own specialism . 
  although it goes without saying that non-adults surely tend to be more ignorant altogether . 
  the extreme left at it again . 
  these people are so oblivious to things that are normal among the general populace that they consider their 'cause ' a reasonable thing . 
  they are extremists in their own right . 
  i wonder what would happen if this scum would ever be able to hold real power . 
  i 'm nearly sure that it would n't take long for chaos to completely rip apart the country they would be controlling . 
  well , at least the stereotype checks out again . 
  your average internet commenter is once again proven to be male , young and above all single . 
  hurray . 
  it 's a default sub , so the vast majority of subs are ` sleeping ' members . 
  i doubt if more than 100.000 ever read this subreddit on a * regular * basis . 
  then there 's of course the huge group of people that only read stuff , instead of ever commenting or filling in surveys . 
  i agree , although i 'd like to add a few things . 
  as you said democracy is the best system we have , although it is the best system in existence * for now * . 
  the problem with democracy is that it started a religion of its own , where doubting some of the core tenets behind it leads to very awkward and sometimes even downright aggressive exchanges of thought . 
  i 've often thought about the very benevolent dictatorship you 're talking about , but of course this ` system ' will be restricted to a mere thought experiment as long as it is n't clear ` what ' should make some persons more fit to rule than others . 
  at the same i think it is not an impossible thing to create a meritocratic system where those with the most skill and good intentions at governing will come out on top - and thus we should actively explore any options to make such a system reality . 
  that of course includes thinking about the framework that would make such a system possible in the first place , and how to deal with the possible downsides ( moral corruption , oppression , nepotism , etc. ) . 
  your example of google , that more and more tends to resemble hal 9000 , is not the best one though , even if it was meant as a joke  . 
  but being ruled by a machine in general ? 
  i 'd say that neutrality is better guarded by a machine than a human !, 
  you pretty much said it all . 
  direct democracy results in * shifting * power from elected politicians ( no matter how poor they are performing ) to far less transparant media . 
  the party with the most funds can in that sense ` overshout ' the other party even more than in the current situation , and it will politicize the media much more than it already is . 
  direct democracy should be reserved for the most obvious legal bills that directly and signficantly impact the lives of most people living in country x. i 'd rather not have the plumber from around the corner decide on the difficulties of implementing proper security policy - as he or she is not fit to do so . 
  neither am i. 
  and before someone starts about elections : those are a necessary evil , but the same problems apply there as well . 
  we are in full agreement it seems !, 
  regulation is key here , and europe really needs to get its stuff in order in that sense . 
  in the end , what we are seeing is massive and widespread abuse of a rather lenient legal mechanism : that needs to end . 
  although international treaties are less lenient than european law , but i concede that the more favorable rule should apply ( that being the european one ) . 
  also , those very regulations apply to * asylum seekers * , not to migrants that move to europe on economic grounds . 
  they of course can walk the procedures , but will be deemed ` unfit ' for asylum in the end . 
  that brings with it the logical conclusion that said people should n't have been allowed entry in the first place ( which they did under the guise of false or wrong reasons ) , as they passively or actively lied about their reasons for moving to europe . 
  if you want to work in europe as a migrant , other papers and documentation will be required - as well as meeting certain requirements in the first place . 
  again : both are not the same . 
   unfortunately , there as veritable bombardment of comments in / r/europe calling ** all ** migrants `` illegal immigrants '' well people that are n't refugees and do n't walk the regular procedures can rightfully be called illegal immigrants . 
  when people here are raging about those persons entering into europe , they naturally have the eagean route or the southern mediterrenean in mind . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that , as that is the image the media gives us each and every day . 
  there are really few migrants that walk the regular procedures to get into europe , not to mention that migrants and refugees should for the sake of clarity not be thrown unto the same heap ( maybe you are suggesting that a refugee is also a migrant ? ) . 
  it also seems many people distinguish between both and consider a and b to be inreconciliable with one another . 
  again : rightfully so . 
  or some countries take it to the next level even . 
  the netherlands knows a maximum timeframe for public release of ` top secret ' documents of 75 years . 
  75 years . 
  but whether it is 50 or 75 years , if people were wronged during that period they 'll likely be long dead already , making publicizing the data still a cowardly act . 
  after all : there will highly likely be no repercussions after that time or people will just not care in general . 
  you can actually ask yourself if declassifying something after 50 years is not equally terrible as not declassifying it at all . 
  it was challenging though : it warns me not to ` glorify ' colonialism and to keep in mind how devastating it could be from many other points of view . 
  you were still right in using india as an example and i 'll keep this discussion in the back of my mind !, 
  well , you immediatly jump to one of the worst examples of colonialism , but one of those positive aspects has already been given : the spread of english as a lingua franca . 
  do not underestimate the use of it , as it can be a vital commodity for one to possess in trade for example . 
  not to mention that a significant minority of people in india came into contact with european education , something that in turn also should not be underestimated . 
  granted : those ideas could 've been freely exchanged , but there is no guarantee that they would 've been implemented all together . 
  on the other hand : the caste system was n't abolished by the british , they were responsible for the deaths of millions during the famine that swept across india , and so forth . 
  india is a difficult example , as it is one of those examples where colonialism took a completely wrong turn if you look at the net result . 
   the subjugation of other people was intrinsic to colonialism . 
  how you can separate the two is beyond me . 
  there is no separation made by me : i however value the negative and positive parts of it . 
  many parts of the world are now english speaking due to colonialism and reasonably well developed compared to the countries surrounding them . 
  to at least make a move to your side : i agree that the subjugation of other peoples was intrinsic to colonialism , even though it is a bit of a moot point . 
   as was slavery for most of human history . 
  indeed , and that 's why i do not condemn the romans for it when i were to read a roman source from * that time * . 
  what is is doing nowadays is deplorable , but what romans did was pretty normal for their time . 
   do you hold that opinion with regards to nazi germany ? 
  depends on what you mean . 
  if you think that nazi germany was a 100 % bad or even ` evil ' thing , then you are dead wrong - no matter what political colour you have . 
  but overall , if you look at the sum of all parts , i 'd say that nazi germany was clearly a bad thing . 
  also : what the nazis did was already partially conflicting with the standards of that time among certain nations ( for example , the holocaust could never have been openly sold to the german people , thus it was kept a secret ) . 
  we will not agree , but try not to quote and snare with oneliners just because you disagree . 
  there is a lot to argue about regarding this topic , and there is no ` clear ' and ` undeniable ' truth to it . 
  out of curiosity anyways , why do you get so worked up about this ? 
  it kind of puzzles me . 
  same mistake again though : you implicitly start equating ` colonialism ' to ` crime ' and that 's where you go wrong . 
  colonialism was much more than simply subjugating other peoples ( something that - again i have to remark on this - was completely normal for that time ) . 
  i am not without feeling : i can imagine the hardships the people that lived under british rule had to endure . 
  but to use that fact of history as a means to condemn something much larger is not fair and above all ideologically inspired . 
  all i want to say is that imposing * our standards * as we know them nowadays unto history gives a false image of the time . 
  we highly probably will not agree on it anytime soon , but maybe you 'll see the dishonesty that is innate to that kind of reasoning some day . 
  i look at the sum of all parts , instead of using one of the parts to come to a verdict . 
  yep , he sure is crusading for his ` right ' . 
  he was all over that topic about the british empire yesterday and apparantly got a bit high by the occasional upvotes given to him by apologists from all over reddit . 
  the guy can not comprehend that one can be proud on the past on one hand , while acknowledging the mistakes of the same piece of history as well . 
  well just for the sake of argument : nationalism does not equal national pride . 
  i do not try to defend nationalism , but there 's nothing wrong with being proud on your identity . 
  the thing is that you should n't turn it into a religious overencompassing ideology ( nationalism ! ), 
  and go overboard with it . 
  yeah , lets avoid the entire refugee thing as enough has been said about that already , but to deny that guilt does n't at least partially drive germany its motivations as of 2016 is beyond reality as well it seems . 
  there are too many references to the constitution and the past in the media that makes it hard to believe this is n't an important player here .
