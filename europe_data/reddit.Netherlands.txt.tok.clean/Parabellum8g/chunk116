  her term will only run until march 2017 : after that she could easily be replaced if necessary . 
  no better alternatives , as with all support for far right/populist parties out there . 
  people feel trapped and will not identify with other parties , as those parties do not share their views . 
  wilders remains as the only one to fill that gap . 
  and yes , if you watch what he tweets on a regular basis you can indeed compare him with trump a little bit , although he 's more of a trump light on average . 
  i 'm completely torn about it . 
  on one hand it is obvious that dutch citizens no matter where they come from should be able to partake in society , and that includes the highest office of parliament . 
  on the other hand arib identifies with morocco as well , and that is something that should weigh heavier in this situation . 
  after all : it 's the dutch parliament , and someone with a dual nationality as its new chair will bring about controversy . 
  i did watch the speeches of all four candidates , and i have to say that van toorenburgh and bosma made by far the best impression , with bosma probably being the best one . 
  he 's someone that is lauded by friend and foe for the way he leads debates as deputy chair ( for many years already by the way ) . 
  the thing is that he belongs to the pvv , and therefore he had no chance beforehand . 
  above all this is probably the outcome of a political game : arib her candidacy was sabotaged by the pvv a few years back ( when she also ran for chair/speaker ) - and apparantly the leftwing fractions supported by the christian democrats believed it was time for revenge . 
  ** edit ** : the title of this post has been editorialized though . 
  the title of the volkskrant article is ` khadija arib ( elected ) new chair of the second chamber ' . 
  not to mention that previous governments apparantly ( but correct me if i 'm wrong ) did n't try to take effective control of the supreme court by manipulating the political allegiance of the overall court . 
  the media upheaval is apparantly hypocritical , but did any polish government since independence try to influence the court in such a way ? 
  also : the new law requiring a ** strenghtened ** majority for court decisions is a whole new thing as well - at least so it seems . 
  is there any polish person that could confirm that this has indeed not been the case before ? 
  edit : grammar . 
   at no point did the individual in question stop being a refugee . 
  they just also became an economic migrant . 
  i rather disagree . 
  of course , one can be multiple things at the same time , yet one of the characteristics of being a refugee is the fact that you are on the run for some threat . 
  or , more broadly , as the un describes it :  the 1951 refugee convention spells out that a refugee is someone who `` owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality , and is unable to , or owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country . '', 
  the fear of being persecuted for reasons for race , religion , nationality , etc. 
  is effectively taken away as soon as refugee x enters safe country a. 
  on the other hand one is still a refugee out of sheer nationality : the state in question ( e.g. 
  syria ) will not guarantee the safety of refugee x , and thus one can not return to their country of origin . 
  the legal definition aside : i think one can no longer be claiming to be a refugee from a moral point of view when he or she has found safety . 
  the threat after all has been taken away , or is neutralized by venturing past the borders of safe country a , thus refugee x should cease being a refugee towards any * receiving * state past the first safe country . 
  or would you say this is unreasonable ? 
  exactly . 
  this is directly connected to ideas about a european corporate tax system - and ending these tax avoidance practices is only the first step in a grander plan . 
  well first things first : i would 've upvoted this comment if it was n't for the idea you seem to have about me and maybe people that are against the refugee influx in particular . 
  just in case you are wondering : i 'm sort of divided about the entire pegida thing and i too realize that quite a few people in their ranks are loonies that are n't even interested in civilized debate . 
   you ca n't close the borders in schengen europe at the moment . 
  you might as well propose that we send them to the moon . 
  it 's not feasible . 
  also , what do you plan with the ones that are here already ? 
  `` send them back '' ? 
  to where ? 
  who will accept them ? 
  chanting silly stuff is nice and all but does n't bring the discussion forward . 
  propose stuff that can be done , not just wistful fantasy . 
  first the passive agressiveness in the comment : do n't do this . 
  you will immediatly not be taken seriously be me or anybody similar to me when using such a tone . 
  ` silly stuff ' is rather shortsighted here to say the least , and i think it roots in your own ideological bias . 
  it can be done : schengen knows a rather ` open ' clause about temporary border controls . 
  that aside : if there is support for leaving schengen in the eu among multiple countries - and reform is not an option - these countries can always choose to pull out of schengen or to simply no longer follow the legal obligations that are part of it . 
  now i already here you screaming ` but there will be repercussions ! ', 
  : that 's not how the eu as of 2016 works . 
  it 's a game of taking and giving , and by default stating that ` you ca n't ' ( an absolute statement bordering on 100 % ) is nonsensical in this situation . 
  the ones that are here should be given temporary permits . 
  the thing is that there are probably legal obstacles to sending the people already in germany for example back , because if even you were to change the law the people that arrived were given other impressions about their future at arrival . 
  changing laws with retrograde fact is not widely accepted in mainstream states of law , so i 'll expect that they can stay and to just walk the regular procedures . 
  i 'd rather have them send back to the first safest country , in accordance with international treaties , to be taken care of in the region under financial guardianship of the eu . 
  we have an obligation to take care of them , but there is no point in allowing them to enter the culturally very different eu in mass numbers . 
  not to mention that it is not fair : you discriminate between those e.g. 
  syrians that are left behind in deplorable conditions , while the best and brightest will not return because of our actions . 
  if turkey for example will not except them , despite financial aid from the eu , military intervention in syria to create safe spots will be necessary down the line . 
  i however am no fan of military interventions , but do keep the option open if necessary . 
   and the people can express their concerns and opinions . 
  you just do n't get to decry democracy when your voice is not on the winning side . 
  do n't tell me the excelent populists that are merkel , hollande , and cameron will go against the voice of the street . 
  problem is the loudest criticism is coming from loonies most of the time . 
  rational people also bring criticism but they are quickly outshouted by the pegida that want people with pitchforks and the fn idiots , or the ukip bigots . 
  the first sentence is a bit of a strawman : that was n't denied at all - anywhere . 
  nor am i ` decrying democracy ' : i just talked about the lack of representation for those viewpoints , the ones you more or less framed as ` non-rational ' . 
  there are plenty of rational people on the anti-immigration side that use a multitude of valid arguments , even within the ranks of pegida . 
  what i warned about is that not hearing them will be counterproductive in the longer run - and that should not fall on deaf ears . 
  there are no enemies , losers or winners here . 
  what we need is a calm debate that is facilitated by the main political parties and overall by a good general atmosphere out there . 
  your comment does not help in creating that environment , as it is full of presumptions and mistakes in reasoning in itself , something you ought to be aware off . 
  we could discuss about this in detail tomorrow : for now i 'm too tired to go on about it any further . 
  you misinterpret what i said : i referred to a gap between what the people believe about * certain subjects * ( most popular of course the entire refugee crisis at the moment ) and what beliefs their rulers have . 
  there is a growing disparity between the electorate and the people that rule them , and that is a dangerous thing in a representative democracy . 
  you can easily judge for yourself in case of the refugee crisis : how many parties in germany are in favor of closing the borders for newcomers ? 
  how many seats do the people in favor of those ideas occupy in parliament ? 
  you know the answer : close to none . 
  do n't make it look like i said something extremely unreasonable and in fact take what was said above seriously : this disconnect has the potential to unroot democracy in a few generations time , because people that ` do n't feel represented ' will be stimulated to vote for extremes because of it . 
  summarized , it has nothing to do with general approval ratings - but with the difference between the people and their elected representatives on certain subjects . 
  it 's difficult to imagine that you have n't noticed this trend all over the western world by now . 
  well she does n't listen because she does n't like those opinions . 
  they are n't automatically invalidated ( even though the media in germany is trying hard to do just that !, 
  ) , but it 's hard to get your way if you do n't have a majority ( if even a representation ) in parliament to push those ideas . 
  basically , the problem here is indirect democracy - and not perceived dictatorship . 
  those elected to represent the people are not interested in that opinion : that 's the harsh truth of the matter . 
  ** edit : ** what is this again ? 
  what i described is exactly what is happening in germany as of 2016 : elected representatives that are n't truly a reflection of the sentiment in germany today . 
  apparantly you need to add nearly a dozen disclaimers nowadays , as i for one actually loathe that disconnect between the people and its rulers . 
  insane ? 
  severely misguided ? 
  yes , and that is an important distinction . 
  they are entitled to their own opinion , and so are the people against mass immigration . 
  that 's the basis of democracy : every fool is entitled to his own opinion - how worthless that opinion may be - without being punished for it . 
  although i will agree they are a ** danger ** to most people , but their ideas need to be dismissed instead of the persons behind it ( in case you suggested that , i 'm not sure though ) . 
   the average dutch person associates the coca cola truck and santa claus more with christmas than jesus christ . 
  pretty much this . 
  and i expect it will be like that in many other countries as well in 10 to 20 years .
