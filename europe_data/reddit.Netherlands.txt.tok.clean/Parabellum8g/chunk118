  pretty much spot on : nothing will happen . 
  the netherlands will bring this case to court in our own domestic courts , or in some other ad hoc tribunal with australia and malaysia , but the people that died will never see justice , or maybe over 20-30 years at best . 
  the people that were massacred over the skies of eastern ukraine will not be avenged , not by legal or military means . 
  it disgusts me , but i realize a certain amount of carefulness is necessary in situations like these . 
  the dutch government however has shown to be a bit too careful on certain occassions involving mh17 , but i fear we have n't seen the worst of it yet . 
   maybe you only have nos and `` staatliches k\u00e4seblatt '' in the netherlands but other countries usually also have private free media . 
  actually we have a lot of private media outlets in this country and they are much bigger than the state owned media ( nos ) , as you probably could 've known with a little of research ( or common sense ) . 
  i did not talk about ` the disappearance of press freedom ' in poland : i talked about taking this independence away from state owned media , which not seldomly reach the majority of the population . 
  their reach is wide and should therefore be clear of any bias , despite the presence of other private media outlets . 
  this in turn will create confusion as news spread by other private ( and often much smaller ! ), 
  media outlets will create confusion as it goes against what the state tells the people . 
  it will split people into camps and the truth will be the first victim of it . 
  arrangements like these will almost always favor the ruling party in terms of popular support , while the people are being lied to at the whim of the same ruling party . 
  masochists that want to see their country tumble into further devious party politics and further erosion of the state of law may like it - as good little sheep - but everyone that is capable of looking beyond that should completely condemn such measures . 
  then again : this should n't be normal . 
  instead , laws should be passed to ensure the ** neutrality ** of state owned media enterprises . 
  of course highly ethnocentric of me , as that 's how we kind of arranged it over here with the nos ( that is still biased a bit , but that aside ) , but a system of law that ensures the neutrality of state owned media seems like the correct way to go . 
  not this : stuff like this belongs in third world countries , instead of modern day poland . 
  a real government should have 0 trouble at all in defending its policies if they are justified and effective . 
  by trying to change state owned media enterprises into government favorable entities poland is effectively weakening it 's own state of law , as public scrutiny for mishaps of the incumbent government will be reduced . 
  do n't defend this . 
  i believe the poles that say the same happened in the past when other governments were in charge , but that should not make it right . 
  as they say : two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  ** edit : ** wow , that this gets downvoted is telling again . 
  independent media are necessary to criticize the government - and taking away part of that independence ( concerning media belonging to the state ) is a direct threat to the people in itself - as the government will be held accountable in fewer situations . 
  that people celebrate this ludicrous action is beyond me . 
  thank you !, 
   from old turkic : sav ( argument ) ????? 
  going to war basically means ` arguing ' in old turkic ? 
  or did i just miss something extremely important here . 
  yeah , and that is a useful form of conscription . 
  the thing is that apparantly most redditors here are either : 1 ) only acquainted with the more negative forms of conscription , or 2 ) are just not prepared to die for their country and moreover , for the people at home that ca n't defend themselves . 
  frankly , i suspect that most would flee . 
  they will never admit 2 , but there 's a real pattern to be noticed in / r/europe when it comes down to conscription . 
  it is radically turned against it and often calls it outdated and stuff , while forgetting that national defense is a vital interest of any country . 
  especially in these times , when our way of life is not necessarily guaranteed due to outside factors this is a ludicrous point of view to uphold . 
  i would not join the army voluntarily , but if i get called for action i will wear my uniform with pride and decency . 
  it is a matter of survival and moreover , a method to protect our way of life . 
  conscription varies wildly when it comes down to how useful it was . 
  i can remember my father sarcastically summarizing conscription in the netherlands as a time to learn how to smoke and drink , next to being mostly occupied with mediocre stuff like painting wheel rims of military vehicles . 
  i 'm not against conscription , but it indeed should have some useful form that actually inspires conscripts , instead of a format that bores or frustrates them . 
  alright , thank you for giving some additional context . 
  it seems like we understand each other . 
  i did n't even touch that subject : i attacked your idea that men are equally expandable as women , which i rejected . 
  you should not connect what i said to the topic above ( that being the idiotic words of the czech president ) or the fighting cause for young men in syria . 
  there is little disagreement between us that being disillusioned with your own country does not give you a binding obligation to fight . 
  just to clarify : you expanded the discussion beyond the original subject by inserting radical egalitarian ideas that are beyond how stuff like this works in reality . 
  a short example : some time back there was a report about structural ` annoyance ' within the dutch armed forces about women always lagging behind a bit compared to men in a physical sense . 
  whether it concerned carrying a heavy ammunition box ( these things get really heavy ) or some other topic , the annoyance was there apparantly . 
  so , before you get the wrong picture again : women should serve on an equal basis on the military ( as stated , there is no discussion about that ) but we should not deny that men are physically more capable to serving as soldiers in general . 
  maybe even mentally when it comes down to emotional stability , but without research to back that up i 'll not venture in that realm though . 
  but physically there is no doubt that men are stronger and faster than women - and that makes * one hell of a difference * on the battlefield where a split second can end your life . 
   if its war , its war for everybody . 
  that is besides the point : the question is whether the lives of men are more expendable than the lives of women - the only sex that can actually reproduce . 
  nowhere did i deny that women should not partake in such a war . 
  i think nobody did here as well . 
   survival of the tribe or species or whatever is not of the essence in any western country 's constitution again , besides the point . 
  there is no need to enshrine what is obvious into the constitution , otherwise our constitutions would be thousands of pages thick . 
  without an independent population to uphold a constitution , that constitution would be worthless though . 
  i hope you see the paradox in that . 
  i think this is common among any population that is n't gender egalitarian . 
  it certainly is n't limited to ` authoritarian ' or ` more authoritarian ' political families , as you seem to suggest . 
  women are way more important to the survival of any population than men , and that is a hard biological fact . 
  not to mention that war has been a men 's thing for thousands of years - and that did not just ` happen ' because women were solely oppressed in that period of time . 
  men are simply physically and mentally more apt for warfare , that being ` in general ' . 
  women and children can defend themselves less easily or are even inable to defend themselves ( in the case of younger children ) , thus there is every right to feel less compassion to young men . 
  of course not to say that young people like us should just die in some needless struggle , but the men among us are more designed for warfare . 
  the rather idiotic words of the czech president aside , let me comment on a few things though . 
  my focus will be on syrian refugees/migrants . 
  first and foremost , it 's interesting to see how the general atmosphere here seems to be very different than a couple of months ago . 
  forgive me for saying so , but the attitude in this topic reminds of the opposite of those far right brigaders of months away . 
  there seems to be lot of overly emotional responses - which is of course ok - but the thing is that the future solutions that are necessary here are being lost out of sight . 
  i do n't doubt the goodwill of the war refugees that come to europe : with their homes destroyed and their families and friends butchered , it 's not difficult to see why people decide to pack their things ( whatever they have left at that point ) and move away from syria . 
  what we lose out of sight is that a large part of them will leave syria forever : they will feel syrian , yet they will in general not return to syria . 
  this in itself will contribute to the already segregated society that is in place in many european countries , including my own . 
  most importantly , we are again ** facilitating ** a braindrain of the people that syria - or whatever the name or form that region will have in the future - will * desperately * need to rebuild the place after the war is over . 
  we seem do so out of rather high horsed values that in practice destroys any prospect of syria rebuilding to its former relative prosperitys anytime in the foreseeable long term . 
  in a way , we are discriminating between those we leave behind ( the people that do n't flee syria ) and those we accept ( the people that do ) . 
  we are condemning those that stay behind to poverty and insecurity that will stretch far beyond after the current war has ended . 
  is it so difficult to see that this extremely short term grafitication of ` our values ' ( in this case , they are n't mine , but you guessed that already ) will lead to long term problems that are n't worth it for the people already living in europe ? 
  maybe put more sharply : where does the grafitication of this desire to help the entire god damn world ` end ' ? 
  there are many millions of people on the run for war as of 2015 . 
  there are dozens of millions if not more than that on the run for other causes . 
  the question is whether we are to help all those people as well , while in turn effectively decreasing the prosperity of the nations of origin when we are taking in the higher educated of them ? 
  let it be clear that we should take care of them with our own resources , but there 's no reason to pull them far away from their birthgrounds . 
  then there 's of the course the semantic issue of whether someone fleeing from syria to europe ( after having crossed into the safety of turkey ) is still a refugee , or a migrant , especially in the light of europe it 's recent support for turkey . 
  just saying that it is best to not lose sight of the general picture after having listened or in some other way witnessed the personal stories of the people involved . 
  i live close to 2 asylum centres ( combined those centres are in the top 3 of the netherlands ) and the people coming here from syria are good people . 
  kind people , that have lost everything and should be legally taken care off since they have reached europe already . 
  but let us not forget about the future in our ` quest ' to show how damn moral we are . 
  that is indeed the most important part next to having the guts to take impopular measures . 
  take greece for example : austerity has really split your people and caused a lot of distrust as well as disbelief . 
  it 's a difficult thing to fully convince the people of the necessity to take away their priviledges , especially when they 've become extremely accustomed to them . 
  you need a rare gift to convince people to do just that !, 
  oh , this one is going to get downvoted to hell i think . 
  brace yourself . 
  old strife  . 
  belgium still is my ideal nation though . 
  i visit it frequently to fill up my car with cheap gasoline . 
  swedish multiculturalism , as well as its radical take on gender equality ?
