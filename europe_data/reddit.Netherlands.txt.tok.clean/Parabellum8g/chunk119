  no but really , extreme examples aside there 's not much to remark on when it comes down to scandinavian nations . 
  just think of the massive territory countries like sweden and norway have : it really makes me jealous . 
  not to mention the beautiful landscape . 
  it is , for these reasons : 1 ) ` neoliberals ' are seen as the driving and overwhelming force behind the imf . 
  despite lack of evidence , and despite the fact that a whole range of nations ( with rather diverse governments ) partake in the imf ; 2 ) he came up with a direct conspiracy theory , summarized here :  naturally they 're interested in privatization and public sector cuts because it enlargens the national assets up for grabs to multinationals . 
  he does n't say it with so many words , but he strongly suggests the imf works directly in tandem with dem evil corporations to undermine everyones prosperity . 
  if that is n't a conspiracy , i do n't know what is !, 
   if you think the imf is an altruistic geopolitical actor with no agenda then you 're simply being naive . 
  another strawman ? 
  where did you read this ? 
  i just propose that you should clamp down on your own ideological bias ( leftwing , that much is sure by now ) and look at things in a more neutral light . 
  there is not a single comment about the imf being ` altruistic ' . 
  you 're putting words in my mouth i did n't say , just to make it easier to attack those persons that disagree with you . 
  but i 'm done : this is going to be utterly useless . 
  there 's no use in talking with some guy that still believes in ideology . 
  i do n't propose absolute truths , as those rather often seem to rule the debate around austerity in particular , even here on / r/europe . 
  yes , argentina was a failure , yet that does not mean that austerity is a flawed method * by default * . 
  i like how greece is often being used as a case study of ` failed austerity ' while we will only know the result of the measures taken in greece at 10-20 years at the earliest . 
  not enough time has passed to judge that the measures taken in greece have been a failure - and i remark on that as i suspect the ** unfinished ** case of greece has affected your verdict . 
  this :  its an imposition of their ideological will on vulnerable nations and this :  naturally they 're interested in privatization and public sector cuts because it enlargens the national assets up for grabs to multinationals . 
  belongs directly in --  / r/conspiracy . 
  this is just a wild theory and hardly a fact !, 
  strong reforms demand harsh measures . 
  if you are rather shortsighted , stepping into an agreement with the imf may indeed seem suicide at first , but the entire idea is to get the economy of nation x back on rail in the * mid to long term * . 
  that is n't possible with small measures , although it 's always sad that ordinary people have to pay up for the faults of their leaders . 
  isolating yourself from the international capital markets is surely not the best way to move forward , lets keep it at that . 
  change is a painful process : real leaders do not fear to take decisions that will impact the wellbeing of the population in the short term , if only for long term gain . 
  not to say that we have such leaders in abundance in europe anyways : democracy has become disturbingly short term oriented in the past one or two decades . 
  but really , i 'm starting to see some parallels with former south vietnam ( strangely enough ) : it was a state backed by western powers and in the end it collapsed largely due to rampant corruption , resulting in large scale capital destruction . 
  ukraine is of course not 1 on 1 the same , but it should not suffer the same fate as that other torn country of the past . 
  not surprised . 
  both seagal and putin share the same emotionless gaze . 
  putin having a perfect poker face , seagal being trapped in his eternal angry warface . 
  ah , the best statistic out there . 
  i could link you the studies that show that children raised in such households are just as well off ( or even better off according to some studies , due to the societal pressure and expectations on same-sex parents ) , but that probably would be useless anyways . 
  i will suffice with calling the next statement total bullshit out of that knowledge though :  remove or change one and bad things happen . 
  well , read my flair  . 
  it 's meant in a sarcastic way , as we have this habit of telling us how good and tolerant we all are !, 
  in reality , that tolerance is more of a sham , even though true tolerance would be better of course . 
  exactly !, 
  indifference is the best kind of tolerance , correct ? 
  sigh , i 'm getting so sick of this . 
  nowadays you have to use dozens of disclaimers on / r/europe to prevent being seen as some reality denying lefty . 
  what did i say again ? 
   watch it : i 'm not downplaying the problem  minority that needs to be taken care off with all weapons in the state arsenal  but those 10 % or so of the total population need to be taken care off , although that 's going to be difficult . 
  to be completely straight to the point , favorable ideas about is among young dutch muslims ( or well , those that identify as it ) have been discussed in the netherlands ad nauseum . 
  i 'd be the last person to say ` it is n't that important ' or ` we should n't take too much action because it stigmatizes an entire group ' . 
  of course not . 
  but you can indeed read a response in it towards the uneducated hords that rather think that 50 % or more of all muslims have such ideas . 
  and i can tell you this : such ideas are very , very common in the netherlands as of 2015 . 
  why do i remark on that ? 
  just to pursue truth , not because i - a person that highly * dislikes * islam - wants to put it in a favorable light . 
  maybe this is more to your liking . 
  diverting discussion is not my modus operandi , nor should we downplay this huge problem . 
  well yes . 
  strangely enough the netherlands are lagging behind nowadays . 
  moreover , the trend more and more seems to move towards actually increasingly criminalizing cannabis , instead of doing the right thing and legalizing it right away . 
  i do doubt number 3 . though : i do not think that any country in europe is really on par with the netherlands in terms of being allowed to openly sell it ( maybe swiss ? ) . 
  oddly enough some american states are much more advanced and pragmatic than the netherlands as of 2015 . 
  if you 're an american reading this : be proud on that . 
  over here the political debate is stuck in some ethical corner , mostly fought by people that have no idea of the failures of our current ` gedoogbeleid ' ( the policy of decriminalisation ) . 
  i 'll admit it : italy . 
  by voting for it i 'll just conveniently ignore the language barrier though . 
  same here , but you just as me you must have noticed enough people at that age that could mentally be considered to be on par with 14-15 year old , rather impulsive teens . 
  this guy is probably no different . 
  also , by saying ` not by default at least ' , i meant that not all 17 year olds can be considered adults , not that 17 year olds in general ca n't do anything else than do stupid stuff . 
  of course that is n't true !, 
  expect it to be closer to 90 % ( as 80 % only had to do with youths , and they do n't make up the vast portion of the sample ) . 
  it just depends on what you define as ` small ' and to be frank i did n't really give it an extreme amount of thought . 
  is it such a moral crime to consider 1 in 10 people a small minority , even if they have some kind of understanding ( watch it : a varying understanding ) to some barbaric sect of butchers ? 
  yes , those remaining 10 % are obviously one hell of a problem , but by saying ` small minority ' i wanted to emphasize that there is a ** much ** greater group out there that does n't think the same . 
  yeah , in that sense he 's correct . 
  it 's difficult to notice : you really need to pay attention to it . 
  in our contemporary society we have this tendency to attribute all the great things about our culture to secularism and science , but personally i myself ( a complete non-believer ) acknowledge that is n't true . 
  but as said : difficult to notice , especially for the untrained eye . 
  our legal system ( as with just about every european legal system ) for example was strongly influenced by christian principles , especially in certain areas of law . 
  the way we approach each other and do business are in the end based on christian rules of how one should approach the other , even though all those things are heavily interwoven with what we call ` culture ' nowadays . 
  violence is never the way to go to make a point , even if rajoy is an asshole or not . 
  but he 's 17 , so i do n't really expect him to observe the subtleties of discourse at that age . 
  not by default at least . 
  ** edit : ** implying that some 17 year olds are still children and not really mentally grown up . 
  this was n't meant as a blanket statement towards your average 17 year old though . 
  the nrc is seen as a pretty respectable newspaper , more of a liberal ( in the european sense , so also with traits of conservatism ) newspaper . 
  it might be important to note that a lot of other national newsoutlets , like trouw and nu.nl pretty much quoted the same stuff . 
  i think you can compare nrc a bit with the guardian , albeit more right wing leaning in comparison . 
  completely subjective stuff , but i think it 's one of the best newspapers out there in the netherlands at the moment . 
  the assimilation part was literally copy pasted out of the article , so i 'll shift blame to the scp !, 
  no idea what definition the scp uses for ` assimilation ' though . 
  say what ? 
  you really need to explain that accusation , as / u/unclesneakyfingers seem to have a different interpretation of national identity , including ` where ' you come from . 
  one i do not share to be frank , but i understand his point of view to some extent . 
  unless you were arguing against the contents of the study above : in that case i ca n't help you . 
  just for the sake of clarity : the study was done by questioning moroccans and turks born here , as well as those that moved here in 70 's , 80 's and 90 's . 
  in hindsight i probably phrased it in a confusing manner . 
  when talking about moroccan or turkish descent i was referring to ethnic origin , even though ` descent ' may not be the most fitting word for that . 
  my bad for giving a less than adequate translation . 
  an interesting sidenote in this study is that the gap between native dutch and dutch moroccan or dutch turkish citizens of the second generation tends to widen when they grow older . 
  the study also says they have few friends among the native dutch population ( those that are fully segregated have none on average ) . 
  in the end , islam is apparantly seen as the most divisive factor . 
  according to the scp , `` practicising muslims tend to interact less with native dutch '' .
