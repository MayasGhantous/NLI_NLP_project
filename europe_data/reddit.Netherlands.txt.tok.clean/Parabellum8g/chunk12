  israel should know that you reap what you sow and its current stance has very much contributed to the complete segregration of the levant heartlands . 
  recognising palestine is key in the two state solution , that is the only realistic option out there to break the cycle of hate . 
  but to the israeli embassy i can say : let us just ignore the un school bombings , let us just ignore the fact that so much collateral damage was inflicted on the gaza strip during the hunt for hamas terrorists . 
  no matter that of the 2000 people killed , the vast majority were civilians . 
  israel itself has shown severe disregard towards human dignity and its backers - especially the us ( because of its seat in the unsc ) - should be less forgiving towards the flaws of this nation . 
  israel in my eyes is nothing but a rebellious child , that gets ever more high on new types of drugs . 
  i do agree with soros his view that the eu and russia constitute two completely different systems . 
  two systems that are irreconcilable at this point and by its very nature both systems are arch-enemies . 
  both have a completely different view on power , participation , values and the use of soft and hard power . 
  those are only a few examples of massive differences , but there is much more to be recognized as ` fundamentally different ' . 
  europe should simply be prepared for any russian reactionary action and it should take all necessary measures in that view . 
  that includes suicide plans to march back into europe , which might already have been discussed in the kremlin by now . 
   actually , if we look to history , was n't germany forged together with wars ( 1871 ) ? 
  germany , italy , france , ` belgium ' , etc. 
  many european countries were created out of the fires of war . 
  completely butthurt that is . 
  they still live in their fantasy world , given how little priority is given to english on french schools . 
  maybe the junta in brussels can fix that . 
  scandinavia ... . . is n't that a russian peninsula ? 
  that is just ... amazing . 
  i like how he pretty much was spot on with all the stereotypes . 
  imagine how much aluminum foil one could buy for 4000 quid . 
  i agree . 
  i regret having drawn the line so easily ; thanks for clearing it up . 
  although i do have a question : do you believe that two vague groups can be identified in turkey ? 
  the group of people that wants to join the eu and are more ` western/liberal ' in contrast to the other group ? 
  for example : i know that erdogan draws a lot of his support from the inner provinces , where people do not share the same sentiment as in istanbul for example . 
  partially surprised , but it kind of confirms what a lot of britons on this subreddit already made clear . 
  maybe that goes for most turks living on the european mainland , for example in istanbul . 
  mainland turkey is different though . 
   brits , dutch and finns tend to elect governments who are against the safety net and pro unregulated capitalism . 
  as for the dutch : ehm , no . 
  social security is something that is n't really being comprised on during coalition negotiations . 
  granted : social security has been diminished a bit , but that was the result of the recession and austerity packages . 
  also , if something has come under extreme scrutiny over here then it is unregulated capitalism . 
  i have to say that our current * regulated * system has never been too open , and even in its current form it allows for too many excesses . 
  people here have had it with all the reports about the bonus culture , personal failures of bankers and unsound financial products . 
  personally , i do feel like a european ` citizen ' although i can not dismiss the vast differences between member states . 
  there is a certain type of eu-adherent that believes that everyone in the eu thinks exactly same and that therefore a federation could be implemented as early as next year . 
  reality however tells a different story . 
  in my view , i believe that the definition of being ` european ' is limited to * shared values * . 
  many european countries have been influenced by a few important historical persons , whether that is in law , philosophy or some other area of thinking , which in turn reflects on its citizens . 
  most young people that i meet nowadays from other european countries are n't that different , although i once again emphasize that there still are some major differences especially with regard to certain points of view that have a more national scope . 
  geography can be used to draw an arbitrary boundary , but it does not really cut it . 
  in short , i 'd say that we within the european family of nations have more in common with one another than compared to other countries . 
  this however does not apply to all countries , for example ( some/many ? ), 
  british persons that more easily identify with australians ( an example made on this subreddit ) . 
  reasonable , as this type of protection really is a democratic deficit . 
  taking into account that multiple former french presidents have indeed committed punishable acts during their time in office this change was way overdue already . 
  ` it ' here being the call to harmonisation . 
  which indeed makes it irrelevant , given that there is no hope for political action outside of treaty negotiations . 
  it basically is not that much for different than calling on the the eu to harmonise income tax all over the eu , fixing taxes at a flattax rate of 20 % for example . 
  equally ineffective , as there will be no legal repercusions , which in turn block any political discussion . 
  the best response the creators of this eci can hope for is that the average european politician in response lifts his shoulders and says ` oh well ' . 
  harmonising is just one of the many instruments that are out of the question in this situation and without a legal base , any discussion will likely be killed off . 
  why ? 
  since the treaty of lisbon ( and even before ) this trend has started in which member states refuse to transfer more powers than necessary . 
  especially given the latest election , it will be more likely that the member states themselves ( for the first time in a long time ) will gain in power again . 
  well , it 's all a neo-liberal plot to enslave the blue collars you know . 
  it 's going to be difficult . 
  let me help you with [ that ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/activistic ) . 
  though i have to admit that i had to look it up before even using it , since i was n't sure myself . 
  let 's keep it at ` activistic ' being a more irregular word that is not used that much . 
  it really amazes me that you remain so stubborn after two people with extensive knowledge of european law tell you otherwise . 
  discussing is not about winning , but about getting to the core of the problem . 
   it most certainly is but it 's irrelevant to the political question . 
  just this . 
  why do you keep on making this completely unrealistic assumption that ` legality ' and ` politics ' are separated here ? 
  as i said before , the treaties are ** full ** of examples of political compromises if you actually take the time to read the text . 
  the eu can not act without a legal base , which in turn gets created by political considerations . 
  even if we discard the creation proces , the simple creation and implementation of eu law often results in lenghty political arguments . 
  it is simply not possible to see both apart , and it this point i 'm just considering your stance here as ' a way out ' , because you made a really bad assessment from the start . 
  there can be no talk about harmonisation without a legal base , as any such talk would be pointless in situations outside of treaty renegotiations . 
  it is just not relevant . 
  simply put , this initiative is simply a modest political pressure tool . 
  when it comes down to taking action , which demands a legal base , the eu will in this particular situation be powerless . 
  i would just try to sign it twice if you are not sure . 
  it 's not like it is punishable to make a mistake . 
  the commission is not forced to make a legislative proposal , but if it wants to decline it has to argue why . 
  and that , in our present day rational world , is not that hard given that the more important issues of today are rarely plain . 
  but just suppose that the commission feels forced to make a legislative proposal , what would that mean ? 
  in the end , the council and the ep will have to agree for an eci to actually end up being law , something that i only see happen in very few situations as there are too many interests involved . 
  a referendum is way superior to the present system and it ought to replace the eci as a legal mechanism . 
  i would not even call this participative democracy to be honest : the eci is just a powerless tool granted to the masses . 
  in relation to that i can say : not everywhere . 
  they only started doing that again a few years back when it comes down to the netherlands for example . 
  do n't pin me on a date , but i believe it was somewhere around 2008 that this started again . 
  the russians actually stopped doing this after the cold war , although the reaction in the cold war was the same . 
  that does not mean that it should be ` accepted ' just out of custom . 
  mature nations should not engage in such wargames in the time we live in . 
  it is completely provocative in nature . 
  what you are referring to - whether you realize it or not - are the mechanics of shared competences . 
  whenever the eu pulls a certain area of law under the principle of conferral into its own jurisdiction - then , and only then , does the situation you describe find effect . 
  i already gave you the relevant example ( and articles ) that would have prevented you from typing this response and by doing so you are making a mockery out of yourself , not in the first place because it is clear by now that you have n't read the articles i gave to you . 
  especially [ article 82 tfeu ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:12012e/txt ) , which is crucial here . 
  a state can not choose its own policy whenever there is already eu law in that situation . 
  or moreover : it can , but such legislation will be killed off by the cjeu . 
  when you really look closely at article 82 tfeu , and i really ** urge ** you to do this , then you 'll notice that judicial competence is really limited at this point , even despite the fact it is a shared competence . 
  there is no way in hell that the eu can criminalize or decriminalize cannabis or something that comes even near one of those two terms . 
  that is just not how it works .
