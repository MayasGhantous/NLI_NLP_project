   that is absurdly high . 
  i agree with that and it should be treated as a massive problem . 
  however , let us not blindly focus on a small ( watch it : i 'm * not * downplaying the problem ) minority that needs to be taken care off with all weapons in the state arsenal : in the end 80 % to 90 % does not have such ideas , even though in my completely subjective experience people in average think there is way more support for such ideas among muslims . 
  but those 10 % or so of the total population need to be taken care off , although that 's going to be difficult . 
  as long as they keep their thoughts to themselves , or only utter them via these anonymous polls , it is going to be hard to do something about it . 
  some degree of planning or action is required for legal measures . 
  rough summary : - half of all dutch turkish and moroccan citizens live mosty segregated lives compared to native dutch people by primarily turning to their own ; - around 1 in 5 dutch turks and 1 in 6 dutch moroccans live fully segregrated lives ; - there is a large distrust towards instutions among these minority groups ; - youth of turkish and moroccan descent feel excluded and stigmatised ; - almost no dutch people of turkish and moroccan origin are fully assimilated ; - ninety percent of the persons interviewed ( n = 3000 ) has no respect or understanding for youths that leave the netherlands to fight for is . 
  among youths this amounts to approximately eighty percent , being slightly lower . 
  also relevant : - 1 in 5 dutch of surinamese origin are assimilated , where 1 in 4 dutch of antillean descent are assimilated ; - an ` important part ' of dutch moroccan and dutch turkish youths in the first place identify as muslim ; - many people of this group feel treated differently than native dutch people ; - dutch of turkish and moroccan descent feel mostly approached as turkish or moroccan in the first place , instead of being seen as dutch citizens . 
  test . 
  in other words , the parental benefits discussed in the article have a rather mediocre role to play here ? 
  interesting . 
   `` there is simply no magic bullet , '' he said . 
  `` unless you can integrate refugees quickly , you 're not going to be able to do much ... we 're trying to make marmalade out of what has come our way rather than growing , and [ we 're ] addressing demographics via refugee programs . '' this !, 
  we should stop punishing prospect parents and give them more financial support . 
  getting children certainly is n't a sound financial decision , and this holds back certain groups of people . 
  not to mention that importing tens of thousands of people from nations that are wildly different than our own is nothing less but treating the symptoms , instead of looking for a real long term solution . 
  the solution would be to crank up the birthrate by financial incentives - instead of discouraging taking children in the first place . 
  guess who 's on the right track again :  scandinavian countries have almost reached the replacement rate in developed nations of 2.1 births per woman , partly because governments offer attractive parental benefits . 
  mothers and fathers get significant paid time off when they have children . 
  it 's critical of the left wing , thus the response . 
  apparantly one can be free to label the entire right wing as racist and fascist ( really : i 've seen this happen dozens of times here in the comments ) , but you are not allowed to tackle the extreme left . 
  it shows the hypocrisy of some leftwingers . 
  basically yes , if only to create a true national dialogue . 
  that dialogue however gets obstructed by all of what is happening today , and in the end this ( indeed hypothetatically ) could come back to bite france as a nation . 
  i think we are both correct depending from what point of view you look at it , but the growing numbers of rather apathic voters and voters that cast their vote out of revenge/payback ( mostly far righters ) seems to be growing all over europe . 
  indeed : there is no telling in whether this trend is going to continue or stop , but each and every time there seems to be a clear link with the current system . 
  i 'm going to sign off as it is getting late here already , but i 'd like to thank you for this exchange of thoughts : it sadly it getting more and more rare on / r/europe these days , which makes this a welcome change  . 
  a few things :  and who will decide when a comment could influence the ballot box ? 
  literally anything a politician says could influence the ballot box . 
  indeed , that 's why a total ban on campaigning would be best . 
  it takes away the ambiguity that comes with allowing certain statements to be made ( for example : ` we the greens want to close all fossil fuel power stations ' should give no problems at all , as you do not tell people what to actually do ) even though a proper judicial framework could solve this . 
  to immediatly get back on the first part of the question : obviously the judiciary , as they are the only neutral judge with any official capacity . 
   not necessairily . 
  a lot of fn voters vote fn because of tactical voting , so in this case it 's obviously not on demand of the people in power . 
  good point , but immediatly ask yourself if they did this as a response to the people in power that asked voters to keep fn out of power , or if they did so out of their own . 
  what do you think is more likely : this being a response , or an independent move ? 
   define `` higher up '' . 
  i was directly aiming at politicians here , even though for the sake of legal clarity any organisation or person given advice on who to vote for in say 4 weeks before the elections should be punishable by law . 
  that would also ensure that politicians do not try to ` mold ' people in their favor via other ways ( for example unions , celebrities , official institutions , etc ) . 
  all in all a very valid question by the way , even though it is much more easy to answer ( and solve ! ), 
  than you seem to suggest . 
   stripping voters to their individual position does n't make them stronger , it makes them weaker . 
  this demands a great deal of clarification , as getting to the core what every individual believes - and given him/her the possibility to utter that via the ballot box - is hardly a negative thing in a democracy !, 
  also , where was this debate between fn and ps/lr for example ? 
  tonight we saw many warnings and prophecies about impending doom by multiple national politicians in france - and effective cordon sanitaire if you may - and that can hardly be called a debate . 
  there is no debate with people that vote extreme right and as long as no one tries to take them seriously ( 1 ) and try to moderate their views by real debate ( 2 ) not much will change . 
  i expect the problem to grow in time , probably hand in hand with the growing apathy among the electorates within present day democracies . 
  i think the best way of confronting fn and its politics is to play open and fair - in an arena where everyone is equal . 
  what happened here today has strengthened fn in the short to medium term , and probably even the long term , as ` the system ' will now be seen as the enemy , or at least seen as more of an adversary than it already is . 
  this move by parts of the electorate - on pressing advice by non-fn politicians - is therefore hardly positive . 
  you are right in way : i am a bit of a purist in that sense , although certainly not for a partisan goal . 
  maybe a limited ideological goal , but even that is doubtworthy . 
  my entire objection to the people that voted tactically today is that they once again legitimized and strengthened the particracy that is in existence in so many european nations as of 2015 . 
  and that system is a rather closed system : new parties have difficulty breaking through and when they do , they rarely hold any meaningful power . 
  what i 've noticed a long time ago already is that the strongest democracies tend to be those very democracies that funnel or influence the votes cast in a favorable way . 
  take the system france is using here during the regional elections , or the uk its system : they all stimulate the existence of powerful blocs or moreover a two party political spectrum . 
  maybe a bit edgy of me , but an effective two party system ( and by that , i mean the parties that have effective power , even though more may be represented ) is just one party off from a one party state . 
  maybe this clears up why i consider this all to be rather worrying and in my opinion i 've posed some legitimate questions about these practices . 
  i 'll remember what you said here , but we should all take the time to look beyond and reflect on things like tactical voting . 
  you missed the ` or ' part :  the formation of a coalition after the elections - or the general political landscape after the elections - is something politicians need to take care off . 
  the first part was also aimed at my own country , while the latter is a more general thing . 
  just to clarify . 
  bingo , although i have to admit that was n't what i aimed at by saying that . 
  in itself , campaigning is detrimental to democracy as the main goal of campaigning is to mobilize people and at the same time distract them . 
  it is campaigning that stimulates people to vote for a few things ( often shallow promises ) and keeps them away from reading a real party program . 
  a more modest proposal would be to allow for campaigning , but indeed to tolerate not a single comment that could influence the ballot box . 
  you could easily judge if a politician would cross the line by reasonably interpretating statements in a proper judicial framework . 
  tactical voting in itself is an evil , as it results in millions of people switching allegiance on the express demand of the people ** in power ** , thus creating a loop that undermines democracy itself . 
  by the way , one could in that second proposal still campaign and inform the public about what party x stands for . 
  any remarks about voting for other parties if the situation demands for it ( as in france for example ) or for the campaigning party itself should be punishable in their own right . 
  let the people decide themselves : they do n't need ` voting instructions ' from higher up . 
  as said in another comment : that is clear to me . 
  what i do not understand here is * not * the fact that people choose the lesser evil , but that they * prefer * doing that above uttering their very own worldview through the ballotbox . 
  in that regard it 's not a lack of understanding from my part why people do it ( duh , fn is way more extreme than the alternative ) , but why they choose to act that way and forsake their own political beliefs . 
  we will probably not agree on this discussion , and that 's ok : looking at the responses and the fact that this is controversial , opinions differ wildly about this attitude anyways . 
  not to mention that giving people advice on what to vote for near the ballot box is illegal in many countries , while apparantly calling for them to vote on something * before * they reach the ballot box is perfectly legal . 
  politicians and their parties should always be legally forbidden to give any advice on how to vote . 
  the average voter should make up his own mind about that , instead of being influenced by those very people that have much interest in people actually following their ` well intended ' advice . 
  that 's clear , but still the thought clings that you actually go out there and vote for someone you do not agree with !, 
  tactical voting is something that the average voter should not be concerned about : the formation of a coalition after the elections - or the general political landscape after the elections - is something politicians need to take care off . 
  i understand that people vote for a party that is closer to their own than the other alternative , but still you go out there , throw away your opinion on a myriad of matters , and vote for someone you when push comes to shove do n't like . 
  obviously , vested parties have a lot to ** gain ** by encouraging such self-betrayal among the electorate , and people need to see through that charade . 
  bottom line : tactical voting strengthens particracy or the power of vested parties , and weakens democracy overall . 
  indeed . 
  it 's difficult to see why people betray their own values and vote on a party they have no affiliation with , neither in terms of membership or in terms of principles . 
  so yeah , fn was kept out of power by these regional elections , but the price for that was voting on your political enemy ? 
  sour move that is . 
  ** edit ** : easy there . 
  in a way i 'm glad fn did n't win , but the manner in which it happened is little cause for celebration . 
  you have to admit there 's a lot of irony in using your nearly god given right to vote and use it : 1 ) on instruction of others ( mostly politicians ) , and 2 ) in favor of a party you essentially disagree with , while there is another party that is closer to your own points of view . 
  there 's good reason for telling this is self betrayal . 
  as others commented in this topic , this will come back to bite france in the future . 
  probably even more people will become politically ostracized because of it . 
  ** edit 2 ** : / r/europe showed its real face again . 
  there is no place for debate here at all : there 's only suppression of other ideas and opinions via the downvote button . 
  it is sad to see what has become of this once so open minded place . 
  no matter : if a few of those extreme right idiots would 've started the riot , the media would 've reported it as ` extreme right riots ' anyways . 
  the same should apply to the lunatics on the left side of the spectrum , which are equally dangerous .
