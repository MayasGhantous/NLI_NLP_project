  germany in particular got one hell of a problem with those leftist lunatics of the afa for example . 
  a good reminder to not draw any statistical evidence from / r/europe or any other subreddit for that matter . 
  same goes for other internet outlets . 
  although 65 per million for the netherlands is much lower than i expected . 
  that would count up to about 1100 or so redditors in the netherlands using / r/europe . 
  good points . 
  about the first part : those obligations are known to me , but there should be some line that combines the best of both worlds . 
  i think its not impossible to save people and protect the border at the same time , provided that there is enough political will to allocate resources necessary to pull it off . 
  obviously : nobody should be allowed to drown , yet shipping people back to turkey while turkey does comparatively little to stem the influx should be considered at some point . 
  and by that i am referring to police presence in the coastal areas . 
   's difficult , you have to confirm that they 're legitimate refugees first , then you have to make sure that none of them pose a security risk , then you have to find a place to actually assign to them to live in while dealing with a pretty big language barrier . 
  there 's always something that can be improved with these processes , but it 's gon na be difficult to do so while also ensuring both the legitimacy of the incoming refugees and our own security . 
  fully agreed , but here again the key lies in finding additional personnel . 
  background checks need to be done by the security services , deciding whether someone is a refugee or not is a longlasting process that also involves a lot of people . 
  i think that germany for example at some point will be forced to hire many more employees for the german naturalisation service to make sure things get speed up . 
  in the end , we would n't want to send a legit refugee back because we mixed him/her up with a migrant !, 
  our distant cousins with sometimes ( in the extremest of cases ) even violent ideas about abortion ? 
  yeah , they are terrible without a doubt , but not as numerous in relative terms . 
  although they are still despicable , let no doubt remain about those people . 
   and lastly they 're similar because they both have t tyrannical offshoots which rely on fundamentalist interpretations of their holy texts . 
  christianity has the crusades , the westboro baptists church , kony and his child army amongst others . 
  whilst islam has the wahhabist and salafist daesh and al qaeda amongst others . 
  not to downplay these terrible events/organisations , but how do they really stack up compared to fundamentalist interpretations among muslims ? 
  which religion got far more of a problem in this sense , christianity or islam ? 
  statistics tell us that muslims tend to be way more orthodox and extreme in their teachings than e.g. 
  christians , and the underlying doctrine of islam is not unlikely to have contributed to it . 
  therefore the comparison is less valid : after all , where are all those christians that en masse sympathize with violence and commit mass slaughters ? 
  we should we very careful with this comparison , especially in europe . 
  but it 's a complex puzzle , that much needs to be said . 
  there 's more about radical islam for example than say the ` teachings ' of organisations like isis/daesh , and we should n't turn a blind eye to it . 
  our efforts should always be focused at defusing the situation instead of making it worse , but not to detriment of problem solving in the first place . 
  well first and foremost you always reason out of your own national background . 
  over here the law is in my opinion mallable enough to come to the same conclusion as stated above . 
  frankly , you sort of misportray my point of view in that regard , as there should be no infraction on the law . 
  however , as we both know the law can be interpreted in multiple ( sometimes even ` many ' ) ways , and therefore there is no single set conclusion as you seem to suggest . 
  there is a serious political concept associated with wearing ` sharia police ' on your clothing , compared to your example of ` pussy police ' . 
  then there 's the issue of making it seem like you usurped powers belonging to the state by that very clothing ( but that 's a personal verdict ! ) . 
  the sharia is a concept that is strange and threatening to the most basic of european principles and should be treated as such . 
  that is no bending of laws - you need not to worry about that - but a different interpretation of the law , and that 's surely more than a slight nuance . 
  and that verdict should be followed , but on a personal level i just disagree with it . 
  there 's a powerful message transmitted by wearing such clothing - and its contents are hardly friendly if we take a look at sharia dominated nations . 
  the evidence is there for the picking in that regard , but the court did n't decide to take that into consideration . 
  it seems like there was no issue with treu und glauben ( edit : in hindsight it seems this is limited to civil cases in germany as well ) , or some other comparable german judicial concept that would apply in this situation . 
  a missed opportunity , but we are free to differ in opinion about it . 
  most importantly , i highly doubt if the people wearing sharia police uniforms would allow the same if the roles were * turned * and that should make us wary for decisions as linked in the article . 
  yeah , you pretty much nailed it there . 
  no tolerance for the intolerant . 
  that should be a guiding principle in judging situations as these . 
  precisely . 
  a harsh truth that is . 
  no , as there is a clear element of humor at play that any reasonable human being ought to understand . 
  sharia police however is an entirely different thing altogether , and therefore the comparison is rather misleading . 
  not to mention that someone wearing ` sharia police ' shirts/uniforms got a clear ideological and moreover political goal in mind , where in your example this is again not applicable . 
  i like your line of thought by the way , but the comparison just does n't seem right . 
  one wants to impose real authority ( authority that resides with the state ! ), 
  while the other is just joking . 
  ** edit : ** extreme left brigades again ? 
  what the hell is wrong with this subreddit nowadays . 
  it seems like there is no middle ground anymore - at all . 
  you 're either a full fledged cultural relativist or a far right hatemonger , that 's how it feels . 
  fortunately not , but in cases like these black and white solutions are likely the best . 
  at least : i have difficulty seeing a middle ground in all of this , but that 's just me . 
  thank you . 
  this means that the percentage of success in going from point a in africa/asia to point b in europe should go down dramatically . 
  i ** do n't ** fucking call for their deaths , dummy . 
  where an attempt is succesful now in say 3 out of 10 cases ( by the way , this is just an example , not actual figures ) it should go down to 1 in 10 cases . 
  the difference here should be made in being intercepted/apprehended by the militaries and police forces of the member states . 
  that 's all i said . 
  and i really think you should apologize for you making it seem like i wanted these people dead . 
  i rarely if ever take insult from anything random guy x on the internet may say , but you completely portrayed me as a bloody mass murderer . 
  forgive me if that pisses me off , but there you have it : i do n't like it . 
  sadly , this is the way this debate is characterized by now : there are only extremes left . 
  moderate points of view are attacked by the extreme/far left and the far/extreme right . 
  at this point i consider to just not say anything about it anymore and just watch how both extremes slaughter one another . 
  what ?!?!, 
  jesus christ , where the hell do you people even read that . 
  please , do me a favor , and tell me how the hell you even come to that conclusion . 
  no one needs to die for me . 
  no one . 
  maybe a bit less lazy and actually read on ? 
  you can comment there . 
  also , just for the sake of clarity : you deliberately misquoted me , and i suspect malicious intent in this . 
  what did i say again ? 
   you mean those solutions which will probably immediatly get framed as xenophobic ** or ** moreover racist ? ', 
  this is the climate in some european nations , e.g. 
  germany and sweden just to name two examples . 
  obviously not in 100 % of the cases , but the prevailing attitude that seeks to punish alledgedly ` immoral ' ideas ( i highly doubt you can even call them immoral ) in exchange for social approval . 
  edit : added some things . 
  certainly not . 
  those extra ships will be hard needed to pick up people that are actually drowning and to taxi them back to the port they set off from . 
  next to that fewer ships will slip through the nets . 
  but even those extra ships amount to treating the symptoms - that much i admit - as preventing people from leaving port in e.g. 
  turkey is more important . 
  i consider that however to be much more fruitful than effectively opening the floodgates . 
  whatever it is , the behavior you described should not be rewarded . 
  because when it works , when you do n't give the people doing this a hard time in pulling it off , they 'll keep coming in large numbers . 
  there has to be a certain degree of harshness at play , or this flow will not end anytime soon . 
   and denying people basic hygiene is a right step to convey that ? 
  this is pure slander : nobody denied them anything . 
  i just said that we should n't give them anything that comes close to luxury or abundance .
