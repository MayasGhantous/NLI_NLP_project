  of course they have a right to a shower on daily basis : there is no discussion about that . 
  i read your edit , but i just wanted to remark on it for clarity . 
  basic necessities will have to be met . 
  nothing above that should be given though . 
  i actually do , much more than you can imagine . 
  but of course the premise again is that the other guy on the internet is a total douchebag , right ? 
  in the example above i took normal ideas like privacy into account ( in case you imagined something much more terrible than that ) . 
  i just see no trouble at all in getting rid of any euphoria on entry of europe : people should know that they can only survive here when they understand that nothing will be given to them - and that 's a tough message to convey . 
  my ideal world is still one that knows no poverty and where everyone gets the chances he or she deserves . 
  and yet again : facilitating a brain drain from developing nations is not the way to achieve that ideal . 
  those nations need to learn to stand on their own two feet , and the people that fled have the very obligation in making that possible . 
  thanks for your response . 
  a few things :  we ca n't legally protect our sea border because the smugglers are willing to sink their boats to get what they want . 
  unless you want to cut out all the eu member states that happen to have a sea border because fuck european solidarity i really do n't see how this is viable . 
  about the latter : no , and i 'd certainly do not want to see european solidarity ( or whatever is left of it by now , lets be honest ) die because of something as mediocre as this . 
  i will also refer to the southern mediterreanean , where the situation is more or less under control compared to over a year ago . 
  the vast increase in military ships and auxiliary vessels there has almost surely contributed to this . 
  each and every country that has sufficient resources should have no trouble at all closing down their own border . 
  it is a type of defeatism as a state - and even dangerous for statehood itself - to say that you ca n't even guard your own territory . 
  the real issue is how much money we are willing to throw at border protection . 
   their housing situation sucks worse than `` spartan '' right now , at least in many cases . 
  they keep coming though . 
  the problem here is smuggler propaganda , not our own actions . 
  it could be a bit more sober , although i will remark that i did n't have the intention to suggest that these people live in luxury according to our standards . 
  they do n't , but even then the resources given should be more in line of what they are accustomed to . 
  basic necessities of course should be given , as far as it is necessary . 
  for example one shower for a few dozen people is no problem in my eyes . 
  optionally , it should invoke some agitation to make sure that this message spreads : europe is n't paradise on earth . 
  this will help stem the influx of newcomers . 
   quickening what procedures ? 
  deportation ? 
  the overall procedure from start to finish . 
  i understand that there are certain safeguards in the procedures - and we should not just remove them - but the entire process of judging someone should receive a temporary residence permit ought to be speed up . 
  on the topic of deportation european governments should properly register all refugees upon entry : this will clear out any obstacles on the way of deportation . 
  the latter is n't up to standards at all at the moment . 
  personally , i 'm in the middle ground , and i 'd strongly advise you to stop thinking in extremes . 
  there is no black and white here . 
  europe does not have a sacred duty to heal all the suffering in the world , and if we actually plan on doing so the least effective method is treating the symptoms . 
  we are - and you can me attack on that all you want - treating the symptoms at the moment !, 
  instead , we should cautiously invest in stabilizing the countries in our own backyard and give the people there an outlook on work and a general higher standard of living . 
  bringing 1 million migrants in this year , while dozens of millions will be born again in poverty this year , is ** no solution at all ** . 
  it gives 1 million people ( in the case of germany ) an unfair treatment compared to the people they left behind , not to mention the detrimental effects of the better educated people leaving on their own nation of origin . 
   germany will be just fine . 
  in 30-50 years people will laugh at the hysterical fears people had about refugees . 
  this tells me that you highly - if not completely - underestimate what is going on here . 
  i do n't know if there are ideological considerations for this , but in case you did n't notice , multicultularism in europe has led to massive problems across this continent . 
  problems that still persist in present day europe , as far as into the third generation of migrant offspring . 
  we are bringing strife , division and further segregation into our societies by importing all these people - and at the same time social problems that will persist for decades on end . 
  the problems of the multicultural society in europe - which groundwork was laid in the 70 's , 80 's and 90 's , still persist in 2015 . 
  do n't be so careless , and think twice about whether the people you laugh at are ` hysterical ' and ` fearful ' . 
  let go of ideology , and look at our terrible experiences in the past . 
  edit : ah , the extreme left brigade has appeared again . 
  welcome to / r/europe . 
  a few , though this is * far * from a conclusive list : - kicking greece out of the schengen zone ( as already proposed ) . 
  my apologies to any greeks that might feel offended by this , but i 'm of opinion that greece has done a lousy job defending its own border . 
  although i 'll immediatly admit that the financial tides in greece itself will have contributed to this neglect of a vital state interest ; - maintaining strict border control overall . 
  this is all a matter of money and resources in the end : the budget allocated to guarding our ` common ' ( schengen ) border is far from sufficient ; - lowering expectations of asylum seekers and migrants : spartan housing and other less attractive facilities . 
  resources given should be more according to their standards at home , save things like healthcare ; - quickening procedures , again a matter of money instead of a matter of possibility . 
  especially 2 and 3 on that list are vital to stop the influx . 
  it 's all about money , and i 'd rather have seen merkel use her extensive powers in europe to fight for large european funds for border control . 
  and by that i mean much more than the european commission for example has allocated so far . 
  what i 've noticed is this clear trend towards ` well , we ca n't guard the border anyways , so let 's just accept it and more or less open the flood gates ' . 
  many of the people going to europe know of this attitude - being updated in realtime about all its weaknesses on their smartphones . 
  whether they come here with or without ill intentions ( i still believe that by far most of them have no ill intentions , just to clarify ) is of less concern . 
  what actually bothers me is this idea that we make a real difference by letting these people in , effectively discriminating between them and the countrymen they * leave behind * . 
  this facilitation of a braindrain of the best and brightest of countries a , b , c , d , etc. 
  under the guise of humanity needs to stop immediatly . 
  europe should pull back out of the relevant treaties and give refugees of war temporary permits at best , until the threat has been lifted . 
  migrants should be booted out altogether , unless they have come to europe with sufficient resources to fend for themselves together with the requirement of being highly educated , the latter being close to european standards . 
  ** edit ** : the fact that this is controversial shows how extremely intolerant some of you lefties are to other opinions . 
  nothing new there - but interesting to see nevertheless . 
  if there 's anything unreasonable about the comment above , point it out . 
  because the conclusion stands : you solve nothing , and actually * increase suffering * in the longer term by these ridiculous politics . 
  you mean those solutions which will probably immediatly get framed as xenophobic or moreover racist ? 
  there are enough workable solutions out there , only some are n't taken serious due to ideological convictions . 
  merkel her ` solution ' has contributed to a generations long burden that will haunt germany ( and surrounding nations ) for years to come . 
  if you could that would be awesome , but only if it does n't take too much of your own time . 
  thanks for replying by the way . 
  would you mind telling a bit more about the contents of the course in question ? 
  as it apparantly did take the time to study these two significant events , as well as the far reaching effects from both murders . 
  i 'm particularly interested in how the deaths of fortuyn and van gogh were explained in the us . 
  i think you 're confused with the people that say :  `` i 'm not racist , ** but ... ** '' ( immediatly followed by something extremely racist ) . 
  he does n't fit that profile . 
  fully agreed . 
  still rather sad that you get confronted with this so often , but then again it 's hard for me to imagine what the vibe is abroad when it comes down to this subject . 
  over here that cringeworthy response is fortunately no longer mainstream . 
  but indeed , there should always be discussion about whether x is right or wrong . 
  doing the argument away with ` that 's racist ! ', 
  is nearly a religious answer - and not far away from physically plugging your own ears . 
  not to mention that one can not be possibly racist towards islam ( a religion ) . 
  thank you . 
  no , but i 'm starting to get a bit wary about this pavlov reflex you see so often . 
  it often has the form of ' i want to say x , but then i 'm called a racist ! ' . 
  could very well be true , but there is so much overreacted drivel here that it rather far from the truth that it requires one to be extra suspicious . 
  but of course forgive me for asking / u/old _ dig a question about the general atmosphere in nz about this subject . 
  there is by the way not much room for ` interpretation ' when it comes down to pc-ness : it is a kind of attitude that pays way too much attention to the feelings of certain groups , to the detriment of problem solving . 
  over here we found ourselves in such a situation around the 2000 's , and it took the murder of two dutch people ( one of them being a politician ) to finally get rid of that terrible climate . 
   apparently that makes me racist in today 's political environment . 
  out of curiosity : why did you feel the need to remark on this ? 
  it feels a bit far fetched to immediatly jump to the conclusion that you are a racist because you consider this an important subject - at least from a distance - but maybe new zealand is even much more pc than i originally thought .
