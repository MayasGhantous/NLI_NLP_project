  question is if this is line with reality in nz as of present . 
  could you tell us some things about the general atmosphere there regarding topics like these ? 
  ** edit : ** it 's just a question people , chill out . 
  nobody hates pc people more than me . 
  that this comment is marked as controversial is telling again . 
  seems like freedom of speech only works one way there when this law applies . 
  i guess that 's another drop in the bucket full of objections towards turkish eu membership , extremely faint as the chances of it may already be . 
  the ideas of the swedish government regarding immigration are pretty far left by dutch standards . 
  but i admit that 's only one subject , albeit a highly important one . 
   yeah , definitely not . 
  the legal systems bare very little resemblance to christian ` laws ' ( there is no clear system of laws in christianity anyway ) and even old philosophers and experts in law who cited christianity as a reference point cherry picked extensively when formulating concepts of law . 
  calling bullshit on this one . 
  i followed an entire course of legal history , and i can tell you that the influence of canon law on contemporary european law is far from insignificant . 
  not overwhelming ( i wo n't say that ) , but you can find christian principles in many fields of law . 
  take for example tort law ( one who damages the belongings of another needs to pay reparations ) , or contract law ( a man must keep his word ) , although the latter was also influenced by roman law . 
  do not underestimate the influence of christian teachings on our legal systems . 
  out of my own experience i 've seen enough examples of politicians that completely ruined a legally sound bill . 
  inserting countless exceptions that effectively destroy the system of the proposal in question , only to end up with an impossible compromise . 
  that this man did not want to indulge in such practices is understandable , as not everyone wants to cooperate with creating such a mess . 
  i expect this was at play again : there is often annoyance about the demands of politicians among jurists , thus chances are the same happened here . 
  not for nothing he has been described as ` uncompromising ' : do you think this is more likely to limit itself to the workplace or to the people he was expected to serve ? 
  my conclusion is clear , but let us indeed wait for the final results of the investigation , if there will be one in the first place . 
  no , but the text suggests his position was more straightforward and practical . 
  this in turn seems to have clashed with politicians in a ` strong member state ' , and his demotion is probably no coincidence in relation with this information . 
  the latter is of course true , yet you did put a lot more broadly than that . 
  that being :  rich areas almost always vote more progressive , liberal like i did not limit myself to the pvv : i compared this statement to how people vote for the vvd and the pvda , the two mainstream left and right movements in this country . 
  the problem with the statement above is that poor areas tends to vote strongly anti-establishment/left wing , where rich areas show a more diffuse picture . 
  if you by liberal also meant the conservative-liberal vvd ( you named two examples , those being d66 and groenlinks ) then you are of course right . 
  as you suggested progressive liberalism i believed you did n't include the vvd in that statement . 
  although you are completely right in another sense , as pvv voters according to research have enjoyed a lower education than other voters , as well as having a lower average income . 
  interesting map by the way . 
  it 's more of a worldwide problem in democracy , instead of being limited to the eu . 
  one could say that it is even a characteristic of democracy , as democracy as a system lacks institutional meritocratic safeguards . 
   according to the same sources , pierens was clear and uncompromising in his duties , behaving solely as a jurist . 
  colleagues told new europe that pierens was unwilling to make compromises necessary to elevate his career . 
   as deputy head of unit , pierens opposed the political compromises suggested by a strong member state in the legislation providing for the concession of highways . 
  seems like merit and politics had a clash here , with predictable results . 
  another competent man dies in favor of the incompetent . 
  another reductio ad hitlerum ? 
  maybe you should lay down the pipe and find another way to criticize the far right , instead of constantly framing that corner as nazi 's . 
  you start to sound like an automaton that only can spill one word : nazi , nazi , nazi !, 
   here in the netherlands , rich areas almost always vote more progressive , liberal like d66 or eco like groenlinks i highly doubt the truth of this statement . 
  the larger cities are actually strongly skewed to left wing , more progressive parties , while the smaller towns and countryside are much more right wing . 
  take the 2012 [ general elections ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/tweede_kamerverkiezingen_2012.png/220px-tweede_kamerverkiezingen_2012.png ) for example . 
  there are enough ` wealthy ' regions among them , while the cities with their larger social problems and ethnic minorities tend to vote strongly left . 
  here 's some further [ reading ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/inkomen-bestedingen/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2010/2010-3244-wm.htm ) . 
  these are some statistics of the cbs which show a very different picture . 
  of the four largest cities , only utrecht ( the smallest of them ) is above the average citizen income . 
  connect the dots , and you actually have more proof for the opposite would n't you say ? 
  on who 's authority do you say that ? 
  i 'm curious about it , as i 'm always a bit wary for people that speak for a certain discipline . 
  if you say he 's a ` left wing progressive ' you basically limit yourself mainly to the economical ideas of his party , while in turn ignoring that the pvv its ideology is drenched in conservative nationalism . 
  take for example ideas to return to the guilder , or its position on the eu which goes much further than the sp for example . 
  or what about the pvv its position on climate change ? 
  that certainly is n't left wing in my eyes , nor are its strong views on islam marginal enough to not cancel out the ` left-wing progressive ' part . 
  let us certainly not forget about the ` judeo-christian tradition ' of which wilders has spoken more than once ; a clear conservative attitude that is . 
  i know its not a popular argument to compare the far left to the far right , but sometimes it seems both have more in common than their more ` moderate ' counterparts . 
  thus the horseshoe theory again , even though it might be flawed . 
  the two axes political compass can likely be more broadly applied though , as it in itself is more descriptive than the horseshoe theory ( of which the latter is less clear in its reasons why something is ` left ' or ` right ' wing ) . 
  though you have to admit that the latter two cancel out the ` left wing ' label . 
  calling him populist will suffice , especially if you take the horseshoe theory into consideration . 
  populism often if not nearly always incorporates ideas from the left and right . 
  ** edit : ** read below . 
  almost all clear racism gets removed here : the comments that stay behind are probably never reported or missed . 
  the real question is what you consider to be ` racism ' : i have a feeling that you mark certain valid criticism as ` racism ' as well or ` veiled racism ' or something like it , when it is n't the case . 
  whatever it is , saying ` what 's the point of banning one book if people can simply browse / r/europe anyways . ', 
  is carrying it a little bit too far , would n't you say ? 
  that 's not the thing : you just framed this entire subreddit , including the hundreds of thousands of people that never even place a comment here , as some kind of nazis . 
  and that was n't the first time , if my memory is n't lacking here . 
  first and foremost , you should withdraw that statement as it is utter bullshit . 
  you can call this place moderately rightwing , if you were to aggegrate the general mood/political leanings here . 
  if that is nazism in your book , well , then i ca n't help you anymore . 
  just for the record : leftists are much needed here to balance any discussion . 
  the extreme left ( just like the extreme right ) however are not . 
  damn , i got so many questions wrong !, 
  though i admit that i 'm completely uninterested in quite a few questions ( for example the number of women working in comparison to the total working age population of women --  could n't care less ) . 
  question 11 feels like a trap question : it 's hard to imagine that * only * 10 % of the people here live in a rural area . 
  i wonder what the guardian calls ' a big town ' in that sense . 
  contrarily , i managed to get very close/almost spot on with 1,3,5,6,7 and 10 . 
  still managed to take 6th place ; that 's something . 
   and rightly so . 
  what 's the point of banning one book if people can simply browse r/europe anyways . 
  excellent generalisation : could n't have done it better otherwise . 
  now go to / r/europes or some other place that is predominantly leftwing , instead of trolling this place . 
  the latter includes your implicit framing of / r/europe as some stormfront outpost : you have to ignore just about every post and every applicable moderating guideline ( as well as moderating actions ) to come to that insane conclusion . 
  or [ self-hating jews ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3uzj6h/im_critical_of_the_migrant_crisis_too_but_if/cxj3pwt ) on / r/european . 
   to act like nothing happened is n't the way to take responsibility for the actions . 
  you simply can not explain to your children what germany did wrong and what is their responsibility , because `` um , there was a bad man , but we can not talk about him , because he was very bad , and he did bad things , but i will not tell you , because they can throw me in a prison for indoctrination of children . 
  where do you get these ideas ? 
  interesting flair you got there . 
  how 's life in the dprk nowadays ? 
  that 's the tragic fate of ism 's i fear : at some point rational thought tends to be cast aside in favor of broken ideological ideas . 
  duh , but that does n't change my answer to the guy above , that called this some eu achievement . 
  i had to put it sharply due to the constant confusion in the media about the cjeu and the echr . 
  to ensure that your average novice understands the difference a sharp distinction between both is necessary . 
  fully agreed : it is nearly impossible to predict the short term future , let alone all the variables that could influence the world in 20 , 30 , or even more years time . 
  there is no telling how turkey may look in 20 years : a lot can change in 20 years . 
  hell , about 25 years ago poland was still communist . 
  today it 's a different nation altogether . 
  the day that happens the eu will be seen as an agressor by the peoples of europe and subsequently toppled within mere weeks .
