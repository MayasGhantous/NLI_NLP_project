  no idea where you get these ideas from by the way : there is no reason to assume that ` federalists ' would be more likely to crush discord by use of hard power . 
  all in all i think you have a rather warped vision of the eu and what it stands for , but thank the tabloids for that . 
   there will be a european army eventually , precisely : as long as the eu exists and stays on the same heading that unified military will be there some day . 
  you can already see it happening now on a smaller level between states ( sharing of military equipment , shared military units , etc. ), 
  and at some point creating a unified european military will no longer be controversial . 
  as long as the eu stays in existence the creation of it is almost guaranteed : the groundwork has already been laid down in the treaties , and the world is getting more unstable with each passing decade . 
  we are approaching a level of instability and rivalry not seen since the days before wwii : a look at history tells us that the world is most unstable during such times ( when there 's no ` pax x ' enforced by a hegemon ) , although it remains wait and see . 
   the problem i have with this attitude towards the police actions is that it is one-sided . 
  that depends on perception , although you might be right here if you look at the dutch populace as a whole ( and what they know about the crimes on the other side ) . 
  there simply is less media attention to the crimes permitted by the indonesian resistance against european inhabitants of former dutch indonesia . 
  to say that they perpetrated the same ` tenfold ' is likely overreacted , as the indonesian people suffered much more during the same period ( in terms of absolute deaths ) than the european population . 
  it was a dirty war on both sides , but what disturbs me about this reality is that when it is being used as a counterargument one actually tries to diminish what happened with a type of ` two wrongs make a right ' fallacy . 
  a crime is a crime , and e.g. 
  murder is murder : we should have no interest ** at all ** who 's colour the perpetrator in question was wearing . 
  obviously the indonesian government should do * much * more to clean its own slate , but that certainly is no requirement that needs to be met before we start to clean up our own mess . 
  justice in the end is blind , and how uncomfortable these lawsuits may be - we have to acknowledge that we did wrong there . 
  i think we come out on the moral high ground by acknowledging such wrongdoing , not to say that we have a legal choice as we already violated international law during those days . 
  we should n't think about one side that ` wins ' , but merely about deserved justice . 
  forget about the uneasy aspects about it before you unconsciously start thinking what passed was directly or indirectly justified because ` they were the same ' . 
  the latter is no accusation by the way , but we should be wary of that line of thought . 
  forgive me for the misimpression then . 
  i just think the terminology you used to describe her work is not really fit for her person , that 's all  . 
  it is no assault , but your use of ` bleeding heart social justice warrior ' makes it seem like you come right off 4chan . 
  basically , it is an hominem while you at the same time do not highlight the reasons behind why those cases became so high profile in the first place . 
  they did n't get all those media attention because zegveld likes to call the press once in a while , but because of the highly illegal and immoral things that happened in the past . 
  things that were swept under the rug for years on end . 
  she indeed is rather passionate - and a good lawyer as we have more of them running around here - and quite frankly i have a hard time seeing why her pursuit of justice should be summarized by you in such terminology . 
  yes , she sometimes pops up in doubtworthy cases ( for example the punt hijacking , you could ask yourself if what happened there is really that clear as she argues it to be ) , but there should be nothing wrong with pursuing justice . 
  she is n't even pursuing * socia * l justice : the term is therefore completely uncalled for . 
  this does n't have ** anything to do ** with social justice nonsense like positive discrimination , radical equality politics and that kind of stuff , but with real , * actual * justice . 
  she helped the victims of war crimes and possibly extrajudicial executions in those cases : doubtworthy ` social justice ' that is . 
  i have now !, 
  seems like an impossible system to work with : it surprised me that the commonwealth held out that long with liberum veto in place . 
  silly liesbeth zegveld : she should 've not stirred the shit we so meticilously tried to hide from the public , right ? 
  think about her what you like , but if she as a lawyer wants to help the people that were subject to dutch war crimes ( indonesia , including executations that have been estimated in the thousands ) , people that suffered because we did n't exactly do things right in srebrenica or because the dutch government * may * have ordered the executions of the punt train hijackers then that is her good right . 
  it 's not like because wrong stuff happened that justice should be delayed indefinitely because its a stain on our national memory . 
  especially your criticism on her helping the victims of the dutch ` police actions ' in former dutch indonesia is shameful : we have wronged the people living there back then tremendously during the period 1947-1949 , including the mass executions of civilians . 
  if you want to call her a ` bleeding heart social justice warrior ' , well , then i just do n't know what to say anymore , except that your feeling of justice seems to be extremely misguided . 
  ** edit : ** to the downvote brigade , you 're being extremely mislead here . 
  read on . 
  thanks : i indeed have a preference for right wing leaders . 
  they are more convincing in their performance and adhere more to realpolitik , instead of going on some ideological adventure/experiment . 
  but indeed , it 's a matter of personal taste . 
  no one denies that . 
  i think most politicians in this country ( if not any democratic country ) are incompetent out of their own respective backgrounds ( that being , not having the right credentials ) . 
  rutte certainly is no exception in that regard , but he seems to have much more of a leader aura than balkenende ever had . 
  not to say that balkenende left the country in rough shape : many important reforms ( such as the wia reform ) were made under his watch . 
  and let 's not forget about the crisis - en herstelwet as well , to name another example . 
  a strong metaphor you put forward there . 
  that 's probably the best way to explain what 's wrong with the \u00a9 mafia nowadays : they fear no single measure , even if it sets a very dangerous precedent . 
  maybe . 
  though the us has pushed the boundaries of e.g. 
  science more than any other country if you were to observe all the great scientific achievements of the past 50 or so years . 
  there is still no country that can rival it 's space program for example , nor is there ( on a different note ) a country with a more advanced and more powerful military . 
  that does bring quite a bit of prestige with it , although it 's all a matter of perception of course . 
  not to say that the us is flawless ( it certainly is n't !, 
  ) , but we tend to forget how much it actually achieved throughout the years . 
  i think that 's the downside of being the most powerful and prestigious nation in the world . 
  of course there has to be something to compensate for that position . 
  but we all love our distant cousins anyways !, 
  because it fits the narrative of the far right voter : ` away ' with the established order !, 
  he also is pretty favorable towards the pvv : just take a look on his comment history in that regard . 
  but to attack myself : if i were to live in the hellhole that 's rotterdam nowadays , then it 's not hard to see that people turn to the pvv for comfort . 
  i 'll admit that much . 
   he probably is n't as corrupt as his fellow liberals yeah , that gave it away . 
  a handful of mediocre incidents and suddenly you can say ` he probably is n't as corrupt as ... ' . 
  admitted : the 1000 euro thing was stupid though . 
  but guess who took the bait ? 
  yep , the electorate . 
   is it maybe because he is right ~ ~ far right ~ ~ like you ? 
  that helps , but by ** far ** the most important thing is the competition out there . 
  who would be more ` fit ' to be prime minister ? 
  the arrogant zijlstra ? 
  pechtold with his lectures ? 
  or samsom , which got this massive aura of egoism revolving around him , so far that he managed to ruin the pvda during his ongoing tenure as leader of the pvda ? 
  roemer would be someone i could trust , but he 's too left to have any chance to form a government . 
  klaver is way too young and got no place in the second chamber in the first place . 
  buma could be something , but he 's too upper class . 
  what do we really have left after that ? 
  my god no . 
  there really is no better alternative at the moment , that 's the whole point . 
   yet he knew syria goers would return and did nothing source required . 
  there are a lot of measures being taken by the current taken by the current government to track down these people . 
  take a look [ at this ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/kamermeerderheid-voor-wetsvoorstel-ontnemen-nederlanderschap~a3874312/ ) as well : it concerns measures to take away the ` dutch ' nationality of the people that actually move to syria , provided that they have a dual nationality ( because : treaties ) . 
  although i do agree that lowering the aivd budget was extremely shortsighted : back then , and still in hindsight . 
  but the rather right wing vvd is not to your liking it seems , and your accusation ` all talk ' makes me think that you 'd rather see the pvv - the party that never solved one problem in this country - should be in charge . 
  at least , i suspect i 'm getting close here . 
  he does ? 
  or do you perceive it that way because he 's not left/far left and therefore not to your liking ? 
  also , the allegation that he ` smiles everything away ' is getting rather old by now . 
  funny how the movement of large numbers of people threaten the eu , albeit directly connected to loose border control . 
  another intriguing comparison with what happened to rome in the past . 
   yes , we should be very vigilant , but at the same time we should continue our way of life , '' he said . 
  `` we have more people than they do . 
  we have the older civilisation . 
  we should not let ourselves be scared . '' exactly . 
  what i like so much about this guy is that he tends to more rational than your average politician out here . 
  he precisely described why the west , despite needing to take the threat of terrorism and more broadly - radical islam - seriously , can almost impossibly lose this struggle . 
  there 's more of us and we have the upper hand : in experience , state structure , resources as well as morality when it comes down to the savage hordes that cling to terrorist ideas . 
   many consider him kind of a incompetent leader .
