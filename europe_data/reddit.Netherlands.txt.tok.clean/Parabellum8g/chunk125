  who 's many ? 
  he 's as incompetent as your average politician alright , but in the long list of dull bureaucrats he 's certainly one of the least incompetent pm 's of the past 30 years . 
  unless you were to consider lubbers , van agt , kok or balkenende to have been better leaders : in that case i ca n't help you any further  . 
  well , after its unstable history and being screwed over by its allies in the past it 's hard to not see the logic in this . 
  basically this breathes ` better safe than sorry ' as a core principle . 
  completely agree !, 
  it 's all in the eye of the beholder - and this verdict sheds some much needed light on the presupposed universalism of some of those rights . 
  agreed , outright denial to the point as we see it in the us for example - or in other countries for that matter - does n't seem to be case here . 
  saying that the vvd deliberately stalls any measures concerning this subject is true , but claiming it denies global warming as a whole goes a bit too far . 
  this is one [ example ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2070863-sinds-wanneer-hebben-wij-een-klimaatalarm.html ) , a recent one that is . 
  vvd mp dijkstra went as far as doubting the observations of the knmi - which is clearly more of an authority on these matters than a mere mp that does n't have much experience in this field , if any . 
  [ other article ] ( http://www.energieoverheid.nl/2015/08/26/vvd-gaat-debat-over-klimaatbeleid-uit-de-weg/ ) , that deals with the recent court case about emission levels in the netherlands . 
  overall , the vvd got a tendency to slow any measures dealing with climate change ( either due to excessive lobbying or out of its own convictions remains unclear as of 2015 ) , and seems to doubt measures to take action to it more than once . 
  by the way , the pvv has doubted climate change in much stronger terms , at least if you read it 's behavior regarding this topic over the past 5 or so years . 
  edit : this might [ also ] ( http://www.energiebusiness.nl/2012/10/05/opinie-rene-leegte-vvd-duitsland-voorbeeld-van-verkeerd-energiebeleid/ ) be an interesting read . 
  only this has nothing to do with the eu . 
  the echr is part of an entirely different treaty altogether . 
  agreed with that , but i do n't see many european countries adopting france its better stance regarding this topic . 
  but maybe other countries will see the light and push similar legislation in the future . 
  not much changed : the echr based its decision on the strong tradition of laicit\u00e9 that 's been in existence in france for a long , long time . 
  without that tradition the court would not unlikely have come to another conclusion . 
  that is reinforced by this :  the strasbourg judges argued that the ban did not violate freedom of religion in a country where ** secularism ** and ** strict ** religious neutrality is ** enshrined ** in the constitution . 
  so other countries in europe that do n't have such a strict tradition of secularism ( honestly , i can not think of any state that is similar to france about this subject , but someone say so if there 's one out there ! ), 
  will notice no meaningful change as a result of this verdict . 
  to be frank , using the american definition of liberal in any european context is wrong by default anyways . 
  definitions vary too much across the pond to use it in the same descriptive manner in both contexts . 
  well mark rutte belongs to the vvd , which is based on [ conservative-liberalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservative_liberalism ) . 
  whatever you want to call it , but i 'd just stick with ` right wing ' as that remains the closest to reality when needing to assess rutte his position . 
  and the vvd is pretty conservative , even still doubting global warming from time to time ( something where close to 96 % of scientists in their respective fields agree upon as man-made ) , being in favor of higher punishments ( something i like ) and having a tendency to sober social services - something that is reasonable as well . 
  we tried the nuanced ( i.e. 
  laid back and non interventionist ) approach for about 30 years on end , at least in my country . 
  blanketing problems and not condemning it in the strongest possible terms is what set us on this dramatic course in the first place . 
  the electorate is flawed - indeed - yet you fail to see as well how bankrupt your approach has been . 
  most people i 've met are for example completely uninterested in cultures influenced by islam and that 's their good right . 
  if they want to vote against the government that made loose integration policies possible , that 's their good right as well . 
  to be frank , the approach you are proposing ( again ! ), 
  has fed the rise of the far right in the first place . 
  better realise that today than later on , when it 's too late . 
  shocking stuff to read here . 
  i wonder if you 're actually dutch , or just a putinbot as vaguely suspected before . 
  this whataboutism narrative comes off as awfully familiar . 
  there are plenty of moderates around here : saying that it is ` very very right wing ' is even beyond overreacting . 
  to say this sub is centre-right/right wing is more closer to reality , at least if you take a look at your average load of comments here . 
  and racist comments get removed immediatly and the people responsible for it ( mostly extreme-right brigaders ) are instabanned for it . 
  do n't portray this sub as ` very very right wing ' . 
  if that 's the case , it was certainly very very left wing about 18 months ago . 
  there 's that misunderstanding again :  we can say what we want no you ca n't . 
  freedom of speech has never been unlimited ( fortunately ) , as things like slander and hate speech are outlawed . 
  the ` circlejerk ' you accuse this entire subreddit off is if you ask me mostly limited to ( perceived ) breaches of freedom of speech , where freedom of speech is endangered . 
  truly , wearing a burqa is a one hell of a sign - that being a sign that suggests you reject the western way of life . 
  even said less ceremonially : it 's a huge ` fuck you ' towards the rest of society and towards the values you or the people around you grew up with . 
  that you are defending the people that wear this - which is implied by complaining about this piece of legislation - is nothing but betrayal to those values . 
  and no , not ` betrayal ' as all those far right nutjobs use it . 
  real betrayal , as you apparantly see the burqa as ` just another ' piece of clothing , where wearing one is an extremely religious and ideological practice that runs counter to what we find normal here . 
  this part of swiss is in its rights to reject those ideas . 
  no , because of a few reasons : 1 ) the abnormality in question is not a choice , but a fact of life . 
  those people can not help it ; 2 ) there is no ideological/ultrareligious concept behind it that is clearly at odds with western society , including the position of women . 
  there 's where the difference should be made . 
  seems reasonable . 
  such face covering clothing does not belong in the streetview of any modern western nation . 
  this does n't even go far enough to be honest , but it 's a step in the right direction . 
  ** edit : ** in this topic : far left brigades . 
  this topic is completely off it seems , in terms of comments as well as voting behavior . 
  people that defend burqa 's - a practice that runs counter to western values - are nothing but traitors to those very values . 
  freedom of religion does not trump everything , and this had to be proven again the hard way . 
  upvoted for the sake of argument . 
  a few things :  it certainly is , it 's disproportional use of force . 
  territory of a sovereign state was violated , casu quo turkey . 
  under international law that is not permitted to cross into the territory of another state ** unless ** with the express permission of the state in question . 
  this did not happen , thus turkey got a very good case for shooting down this airplane . 
   no doubt i 'm biased , but i do n't think as much as you though , and i wonder if you 're even aware of that . 
  well , it 's rather hard to ignore all the news reports of the past + - 2 years about incursions in europe - by * russian * fighter jets - and other aggressive behavior . 
  i 'm not going to pretend this did n't happen - or say it is ` justified ' - just because nato and western nations in general tend to play their own dirty game as well . 
   does n't mean it 's morally or comparitively defendible , or even superior to . 
  i certainly do not celebrate the death of 2 soldiers . 
  maybe turkey should 've taken the same approach as we do , and just escort those fighters out of their airspace . 
  the diplomatic route if you may , but that does n't mean turkey still was n't ` allowed ' to act as it did . 
  hard as it might be , you need to distinguish between what is morally allowed and what is legally allowed , as both not rarely do not overlap . 
   nobody said it was . 
  indeed , yet we are talking about who 's the aggressor here ? 
  you seem to ignore the fact that this was in response to a border incursion itself !, 
  if it gets proven that russia actually did not violate turkish territory , the whole situation changes altogether . 
  but this surely [ does not seems to be the case ] ( http://www.politicoscope.com/turkey-turkish-f-16-jets-shot-down-russian-warplane/turkey-has-released-flight-radar-images-appearing-to-show-that-the-russian-jet-briefly-flew-over-southern-turkey-before-it-as-shot-down-cnn-turk-reports/ ) so far , even though independent verification is required . 
   it 's not hard to see who the aggressor is indeed , that 's turkey . 
  it certainly is n't that clear cut , and i suspect an ideological bias after reading your comment to be honest . 
  granted : conflict like this should have stayed in the cold war , but if a foreign force is guilty of a border incursion the state which territory was infringed upon is legally allowed to defend itself by force . 
  a declaration of war is certainly not required beforehand . 
  the same by the way goes for any incursion by the turkish airforce into greek airspace , or american incursions into china . 
  about the latter : could you link that ? 
  because you might be referring to the american presence near the senkaku islands or the spratley islands , both of which are claimed by multiple nations . 
  edit : fixed some things edit 2 : sure , hit that downvote button . 
  it certainly wo n't make me change my mind  . 
  and let us above all forget ** all those reports ** about russia violating or skirting the airspace of european nato members . 
  the putinbots never left after all it seems . 
  welcome back guys !, 
  this is [ one ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/23/world/europe/russian-bombers-intercepted/ ) example . 
  then there 's of course the baltic states . 
  on the contrary ( just for the sake of objectivity ) the russians have n't violated uk airspace yet , despite showing highly aggressive behavior in close proximity to [ it ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11609783/mapped-just-how-many-incursions-into-nato-airspace-has-russian-military-made.html ) . 
  same goes for [ denmark ] ( http://globalnews.ca/news/2217416/denmark-intercepts-russian-bomber-aircraft-near-territorial-airspace/ ) . 
  for me it is not hard to see who the aggressor is , especially in the absence of nato planes doing the same besides an incidental mistake ( if even existant ) .
