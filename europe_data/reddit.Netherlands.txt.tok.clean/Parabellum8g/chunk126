  those things are n't relevant to this situation : the only thing you need to is assess whether turkey was in its right to shoot down this fighter plane . 
  all the sidestuff that happened over the past few months is in no way relevant to determine whether turkey was allowed to act in this situation yes or no . 
  ironically , it will all boil down to radar imagery . 
  turkey will undoubtedly say that the plane was in turkish airspace , where russia will deny it from happening . 
  given what russia pulls here in european airspace every once in a while i feel inclined to believe turkey over russia . 
  but let 's wait for the response of all nations involved , shall we ? 
  if the sukhoi indeed infringed on turkish airspace then turkey was indeed in its rights to shoot it down legally speaking , whether it was the right thing to do or not . 
  the pilots are the real victims : they probably acted to orders to play such cold war-esque ` games ' . 
  not to mention that the russian airforce has infringed on the airspace of nato member states more than once : it seems to happen repeatedly and on a regular basis . 
  not to say that turkey is blameless in this entire conflict ( it certainly is n't ) , but turkey may find itself on higher ground here . 
   racist , fascist , nazi , all sorts of terms used to demonize people . 
  exactly , mostly pulled directly out of context and used as a lexical weapon to ` silence ' opponents . 
  it is because of this very reason that i consider the people that use racist , fascist , nazi and other loaded terms in such a way to be on the same level as * actual * racists , fascists and nazi 's . 
  the extreme left and the extreme right both are to be feared , as they are so firmly entrenched in their own ` correct ' beliefs that they 've forgotten the need to keep them in line with reality . 
  this is what ideology does to people : no one should ever forget that . 
  there 's speculation going on about it being abdeslam his belt in other media , including dutch sources . 
  this article however expressly states the following :  two men who were arrested last week and confessed to driving abdeslam to belgium said that he was wearing an explosive belt when they picked him up . 
  whatever it is , the title may suggest explosives were left behind with the intention of killing others , though a trash can is not the best of locations . 
  maybe a bit of clarification is required , despite it been pretty obvious that the belt was ditched by someone , whether salah abdeslam or some other person . 
   but do n't try and tell me that politicians are the most honest people in this world who do everything in the light of day and share everything with the people . 
  i dare to say that almost * no one * believes that here . 
  that is not what people argue against : it 's the way of mindlessly accepting x as fact , just because there is a dislike/suspicion for party y. 
  that does n't mean that x is true , just because y is suspicious . 
  that 's all i wanted to say : conspiracy theorists partake in mental gymnastics in that regard , because they have a habit of invalidating the need for proof . 
  and whenever there is proof , it is doubtworthy most of the times in itself due to being a matter of interpretation . 
  that 's a nice strawman . 
  but let me help [ you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy ) . 
  there you go . 
  wrong . 
  it 's up to the unsc , the only organ in the un with real power . 
  the general assembly can do jack shit in cases like these . 
  it 's just weird to say something is the case without seeing conclusive evidence . 
  the problem with conspiracy thinking is that it is a coping mechanism : conspiracy thinkers are in constant denial about reality and have severe difficulty accepting it altogether . 
  the thing is that conspiracy thinkers consciously blur the line between reality and fantasy and present that as some form of wisdom . 
  it is not : get that out of your head . 
  being careful with what the government says is one thing , assuming things on zero or uncredible evidence is an entirely different thing in turn . 
  i can see my town from that map !, 
  it 's in that red blob . 
  you know , the one near the belgian border . 
   this will only lead to isil being invited in to the un . 
  are you serious ? 
  why do you think that ? 
  yeah , and a clear example of herd behavior . 
  mostly brought forward by the people that themselves have not a single clue about the organisation they 're talking about , but blindly follow ` something ' they read ` somewhere ' on the internet . 
  exactly . 
  also , the un as we all know does n't have its own army ( although the charter its wording does suggest that the drafters did have this idea in mind ) , thus it needs to call upon any coalition of the willing to do the dirty work . 
  saying that the ` the un refuses and prefers to send another sternly worded letter ' in itself makes me think of 1 ) a very shallow comprehension of what the un is and what is powers and capabilities are , 2 ) a general hatred towards international organisations , probably out of confusion due to the eu its failures over the past few years . 
  france takes the correct course of action by guiding this through the unsc . 
  not a single state will defend isis anyways and although defensive war is allowed under international law , france wants to observe international law in this situation . 
  good for them , as without these initiatives international law would be meaningless anyways . 
  how eloquent . 
  also , this is n't rutte his proposal , but rather the opinion of vermeend and van der ploeg . 
  as you can read in the article . 
  that 's a personal thing , but one should never offset the value of human life versus something as mediocre as costs of incarceration - even for scumbags like him . 
  also , it 's not true that the death penalty is cheaper : the judicial procedures that preclude the execution , as well as the execution itself and other costs , apparantly cost more than 1 million dollars in the us for example . 
  then there 's of course the moral issue : why punish the crime of murder with - you guessed it - murder ? 
  even if it 's in the name of justice it remains murder after all . 
  these guys should rot in prison for the rest of their lives : that 's enough vengeance . 
  edit : the cops in question killed him out of self defence and therefore his death is justifiable . 
  obvious response , but still : good riddance . 
  sad that such persons never have to explain themselves in front of a court though : life imprisonment is much more fitting of a sentence for them . 
  nos reports about it as [ well ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2069955-franse-media-brein-achter-franse-aanslagen-gedood.html ) . 
  ** edit : ** french prosecutor molins so far has not confirmed the identity of those [ killed ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/18/paris-attacks-suspected-mastermind-abdel-hamid-abu-oud-was-target-of-raids-latest-news ) in the raids :  `` i can not give you details about the identities of suspects yet , '' molins says . 
   there are two people dead but it will take a bit longer to get the additional details , because the building had to be propped up because it was threatening to collapse . 
  ** edit2 ** : confirmed dead . 
  interesting : thanks for the link !, 
  it seems like the afd is riding the waves of the recent refugee crisis , same as the pvv here in the netherlands . 
   i 'm not sure about the pvv , but was n't their development a more steady growing process allowing them to build a solid baseline ? 
  yes and no . 
  the pvv started out as a one man faction in parliament ( geert wilders ) that managed to gain about 8 seats in the first elections after its inception . 
  in the elections afterwards the pvv gained 15 seats , only to fall back to 12 nowadays . 
  at the moment that pvv is somewhere around 35 seats in the polls , only to be followed by the vvd at considerable distance . 
  what is important to notice is that the pvv did not really break the taboo on talking about subjects like immigration and overzealous political correctness : the lpf and more precisely its murdered leader - pim fortuyn - were the first to do so . 
  the pvv made clever use of the fortuynist crowd after the collapse of the lpf and filled in the void it left . 
  the spotlight to france is normal : there is no single obligation to zoom in more on turkey than on france , or even spent an equal amount of time on what passed on turkey . 
  the attacks on france were perpetrated in the european heartlands and moreover in one of the centers of the western world . 
  next to that the attacks were perpetrated against people that resemble us very closely , while turkey is a bit more distant . 
  not to mention the hypocrisy of this argument : the turkish press will without a doubt in turn spend more time on reporting about internal affairs or things that are closer to home than stuff that is more distant . 
  there is nothing wrong with feeling more about the people you can relate to more easily , and the media act to it . 
  not to mention that most global media enterprises are actually situated in the western world . 
  the vvd did the same here ( becoming more right wing to counter the rise of the vvd ) but it did n't result in the pvv disappearing . 
  what we have to acknowledge is that these parties fill in a certain niche that quite a large minority of the population seems to be attracted to , thus taking over certain points of view does not end the existence of the other party . 
  the protest vote is born out of deep distrust and will continue to increase in share as long as the reasons behind it ( for example parties breaking election promises ) are n't taken away . 
  similar predictions were made in the early days of the pvv here , yet about 10 years later it is leading high in the polls ( the distance between the pvv and the vvd in the polls is rather large ) . 
  this entire pattern feels very familiar to me as a dutchman , and i 've watched the pvv its development from the very beginning . 
  i could be wrong , but certainly not as absolutely as you want to make it look . 
  europe is in itself shifting towards the right and this ongoing development fits in that very pattern . 
  you can disagree with me on the future of the afd but rest assured : this party or some other entity that got similar points of view will be there to stay . 
  domestic experiences here and the rise of other , new parties in europe has a great deal of predictive value in that regard . 
  in the meanwhile , remember the prediction of this one dutch guy for the future . 
  i could very well still be hanging around on reddit when the afd or a similar party becomes mainstream . 
  fits in what we are seeing in the rest of europe , though it remains a bit unexpected . 
  i would 've expected germany to turn at least 5 years in the future at the earliest , but it seems like the current suicidal asylum policy in germany has resulted in people making a move forward . 
  i wonder how much seats the afd can gather in the next elections . 
  if experiences in other european countries have any predictive value then you can rest assured that the afd will be there as a solid alternative even after the refugee crisis has been resolved . 
  the taboo has been broken it seems : that 's good . 
  this may be of [ use ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/15/5-facts-about-the-muslim-population-in-europe/ ) . 
  the netherlands is standing at 6 % at the moment and france at 7,5 % , meaning that france relatively speaking got 25 % more muslims . 
  according to the article above france knows 18 fighters per 1 million people , the netherlands 15 fighters . 
  assuming that almost all people that fight for the islamic state are indeed muslims ( a very reasonable statement if you ask me ) there still is almost no difference to be noticed even after taking this factor into account .
