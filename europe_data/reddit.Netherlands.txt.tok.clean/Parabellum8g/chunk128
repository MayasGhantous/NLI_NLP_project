  the first thing we actually agree on : it is indeed less relevant , but i inserted that part to counter the moralistic ` pressure ' that is being practiced on others like me to just accept these people without question . 
  i tasted this in one of your previous comments ( that 's why i spoke of a perceived ` moral highground ' ) , and wanted to ask you some valid questions in connection to that . 
   it is the demand for gratitude and the failure to see why a refugee might complain that is problematic . 
  there is no single demand for them to dance in the streets and bless the ` salvation ' brought to them by the dutch state . 
  contrarily : there is no need to complain as seen in the article ( there are other ways , for example discussing difficulties with the coa , the entity responsible for harboring these people ) . 
  also : there is no failure to ` see ' why these people may complain . 
  i just do n't accept the complaint as appropriate on the backdrop of their own circumstances , combined with the already slim domestic support for helping these people in the first place . 
   to claim you believe they should all be only ever grateful because of some subjective , cooked up logic of yours is beyond the pale . 
  to be honest , you are quite framing me - and misportraying what i said as some ` exclusive ' idea that only finds support in me . 
  i did not claim that they ` should all be only ever grateful ' , nowhere ever . 
  i asked that these people respect the fact that they 've been given shelter here , where they could 've been left to starve or sent off to some other country with lower standards of living . 
  you wo n't find many dutch people out there that ` respect ' what these people did today . 
  this only feeds the increasing hatred towards refugees in general - often misplaced hatred - and therefore this behavior should be condemned in the strongest possible terms . 
  just imagine me walking into your house , opening your fridge and asking you where the hell the mayonaise is . 
  it is beyond all shame to even make such a request !, 
  your perceived moral high ground is certainly not well received on this side , but i really have a good feeling in which ` corner ' of the political spectrum you belong . 
  that 's all fine , but that guarantees we are not going to agree anytime soon . 
   and you know this from your experience of having fled a war ? 
  have you ? 
  have any of the people responding here , except some exceptions here and there ? 
  it shows how flawed this argument is . 
  a few other things , though i do n't want to waste much time on this ( given that you will not likely make any concessions ) :  and you know this from your experience of having fled a war ? 
  i ask because there are a lot of documented complaints from refugees fleeing various places in wwii complaining of the condition in the places that they made it to . . any comparison with ww2 is false and misleading : we are talking about people that come from dramatically different countries , in a cultural sense as well as in turns of human development . 
  when you are trying to compare refugees in ww2 , that being people of european heritage over 70 years ago , with the people that are coming in now you 're making a grave mistake . 
  that aside , my answer remains the same : you have no right to complain even then as long as you 're properly taken care off . 
  if the netherlands would disintegrate tomorrow and become some european somalia ( clarification : a failed state plagued by internal unrest ) and germany would accept me into the safety of its borders , the last thing i would do is openly complain !, 
  it is against all common decency to do so against your host . 
   a lack of gratitude ? 
  the people who are fleeing war have had their lives destroyed , their country destroyed , potentially family members raped , killed or captured . 
  potentially their entire existence has been turned upside down , but you are bothered by the fact that they are n't showing you the relevant amount of gratitude ? 
  the lack of empathy is palpable and really quite sad ... first of all , who is fleeing from war ? 
  many of the people coming into europe today are n't fleeing from war , so it certainly is n't as clear cut and fantasy like as you would like it to appear . 
  those that are fleeing from war should be given some leeway in expressing themselves out of emotional distress , but even then there should n't be much of a margin for it . 
  i am certainly no person that ` lacks ' empathy : i just do n't think we are solving anything by allowing these people in in large numbers . 
  this year europe accepts over 1 million of them , while next year dozens of millions will be born in absolute poverty again . 
  what are we fixing ? 
  why does this drop in the bucket make any difference ? 
  why should we facilitate a brain drain from countries that are already struggling ? 
  most importantly : why should we make an unfair distinction between the people hit by conflict x or some other grave cause ? 
  we should not . 
  the answer should always be taking care of these people in the direct vicinity of their nation of origin , and make sure that they return to rebuild it . 
  those syrians that we are taking in this year will be very needed by the time the civil war in syria draws to an end . 
  something that will happen sooner or later . 
   great , and your punishment for those is deportation ? 
  would you have applied that to european refugees who fled in wwii , the spanish who fled spain ? 
  again , the same false comparison , and again i do not make a difference in that situation . 
  since you like the comparison though : if germany were to hypothetically speaking disintegrate tomorrow i would expect all germans coming to this country to make do with was given to them . 
  we in turn have an obligation to provide them the basic necessities of life . 
  it is a distinction out of principle : a person that flees from war is happy enough to be * safe * . 
  that 's the first and foremost thing . 
  everything that accompanies life at this safe haven , whether it be food or accommodation , are of a secondary nature . 
  the most important feeling that goes through your mind in such a case is that you do not need to fear for your own life . 
  a migrant strictly does not flee because of any political causes , or out of a lack of safety . 
  as has been said before : there 's even a case to be made that every refugee that crossed into europe , after they set foot on e.g. 
  turkish or lebanese soil , is no longer a refugee but a migrant . 
  that aside : whether you agree or disagree with the distinction made is not the most important thing . 
  behavior as outlined in the article above shows a clear lack of ** gratitude ** , and that is what stings the most . 
  we are having increasingly more problems in this country when it comes down to this subject , and this certainly does not help . 
  the nationalist , far right pvv is leading high in the polls , only to be followed by other parties at considerable distance . 
  this development will certainly not move in the opposite direction by this kind of news . 
  and yes , if you ask me , a refugee or migrant got no right to complain after being properly taken care off . 
  none whatsoever : they are being provided for by the means of others and therefore a bit of humbleness is required . 
  no , in fact it has a lot to with do it . 
  a true refugee does not make complaints as you can read in the article : an entitled migrant however could . 
  the people that complain about stuff like this , while they 've been given shelter and daily food , are n't refugees at all . 
  too bad the procedures do not provide for immediate deportation for such behavior : people that show these traits should be selected for deportation in some other way though . 
  they are certainly * not * needed here . 
  newcomers that complain about these things are not likely to ever contribute to society in a positive manner . 
  round them up , lock them up and subsequently throw them out : that 's what should be done . 
  that was quick . 
  not much more can be said about it really . 
  was this expected to happen in portugal ? 
  i did read about the fuss around the new government and the current president its role in this fiasco , but did everyone see this coming ? 
  indeed . 
  but you forgot to mention that the same applies to your average briton that responds here . 
  all people commenting on the internet are some specific demographic , thus lets take no one seriously in the end . 
  or is that too much ? 
  listen to yourself trucidator : everything to gain and nothing to lose . 
  has your hatred towards the eu as it exists nowadays resulted in black and white reasoning ? 
  there will be damage for all parties involved , which is why these kind of politics should not be held in high regard by anyone . 
  cameron is maybe even deliberately ostracizing the uk populace to serve the interests of his sponsors and supporters , instead of his own people . 
  you hit the nail on the head : the uk got seemingly much more to lose than it likes to admit . 
  politicians of the type of cameron and the people that back him should be given the hard treatment . 
  the eu should call cameron his bluff and let him find out what kind of chaos and barriers a loss of membership would entail . 
  lately it was mostly misinformed , anti-eu rambling . 
  this topic however shows that people are increasingly annoyed by the uk its attitude . 
  let me summarize it correctly : one single member state can not speak for the union as a whole , specifically about what it ` needs ' . 
  i can not shake the idea that britain * again * wants a special treatment that - as pointed out elsewhere - undermines the entire idea of a union in the first place . 
  really , i do not hate the british people ( i like them for multiple reasons ) , but if there is indeed enough support for the rash ideas of its leaders then the uk ought to leave . 
  give the hard treatment if necessary : we 'll see who was right in 30 years time . 
  ** edit : ** such resentment and hatred towards another man 's opinion . 
  i think this is an excellent case example of how little tolerance we all have for each others opinion nowadays , and how heated this debate has really become . 
  i 'll repeat it again : if britain does not want to fall in line , then regretfully it should leave . 
  we do not need a saboteur in the european union , especially if the vast majority of european governments have a very different attitude towards the project . 
  and that is democracy as well , difficult as that may be to admit . 
  it puzzles me in the first place that this debate has become so heated to the point that asking to let go of the fundamental principles beneath this supranational partnership is considered a rational subject of negotiations . 
  this is what happens : brussels will give cameron some minor concessions , which he will present as a major victory domestically . 
  people vote in favor , and business as usual will continue . 
  mark my words : this will happen . 
  hyperbole detected .
