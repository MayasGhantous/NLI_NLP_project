  the last part is something i gave a lot of thought lately , and i have difficulty in coming up with a clear answer . 
  russia has developed rather separately from the rest of europe though , especially during communism . 
  the levels of nationalism in russian society are nowhere near that of the netherlands for example , but honesty obliges me to compare russia with other slavic nations . 
  in that case the differences are more slim and again this brings the question forward where the cutoff point of this arbitrary border should be . 
  for me , there is little question that russia is wildly different than the netherlands and surely not exclusively european in its traditions and attitudes . 
  then there 's the issue of landmass : much of russia lies in asia and a very significant part of the population is based there . 
  again : arbitrary in nature , but defendable on basis of territory , large cultural differences ( there are many similarities though ) and where the population is located . 
   well , while i agree , i 'm not sure not just if eastern european people are sharing the same ideals or values as a bulk with western europeans , but also even some western europeans are sharing these . 
  concerning human rights ( for example the ban on the death penalty , the ability for gay people to get married etc ) controversial topics are not universally supported by the population . 
  especially stuff like freedom of religion ( that being : all religions ) and gay marriage are extremely controversial in eastern europe it seems , and less controversial here . 
  many people here for example support gay marriage ( close to 80 % of the population ) while the reverse applies for poland . 
  but that is just human rights : in the end all states in europe are states of law ( that being : also in practice , not just on paper . 
  russia for example is ** not ** ) , based on democratic ideals that work together on a basis of solidarity . 
  many of them are strong states with a rich humanist tradition and separation of powers based on the ideas of persons like montesquieu . 
  there surely is a lot that binds them - more than they 'd like to admit - and that is all * but * a small detail . 
  edit : about the earlier part about islam : my thoughts were with the caucusus region as a whole . 
  it seems like i misread what you said ( north caucasus !, 
  ) , so my apologies . 
  next stop : an enabling act/patriot act . 
  and when was i talking solely about geography ? 
  when i talk about europe i mostly talk about the eu and its direct sphere of influence , not about europe in the geographical sense . 
  it is completely obvious that mount elbrus is in europe from the latter point of view , but i wanted to respond to the poster his intentions behind the post . 
  i will remark that your condescending attitude is annoying , especially how you 1 ) misread what i said and 2 ) connected some ` in my time everything was better ' comment . 
  ask people here whether the caucasus mountain range - which lies beyond the black sea - is in europe , and most people will say no . 
  i promise you : * that * is what most will say . 
  you make a lot of good points - and i agree with most of it - yet we have to acknowledge that many people do not reason like that . 
  the religious influences of islam are also a watershed between europe - where islam is only the dominant religion on a tiny part of its territory . 
  that has inevitably influenced the culture of both regions to some extent ( for example : the influence of canon law on present day law is certainly not unimportant !, 
  ) , and there will be differences because of it . 
  the shared values thing in itself is the foundation beneath the eu as well as its doom at the same time . 
  the recent refugee crisis has painfully exposed the differences between eastern and western europe and it is difficult to say how much alike both are exactly . 
  as said before : europe is arbitrary in this regard , as one could question whether changing values among the leaders of country x necessarily says something about the nation as a whole . 
  i think it does n't : in the end a nation is comprised of its people , and not solely its leaders , and in that regard eastern and western europe are quite different . 
  still , there is much that connects them through history and i expect that all nations in europe will grow closer together as time passes on . 
  ukraine in that regard could fight itself free of russian sphere of influence and become fully european as well - that being in the sense of being a member of the eu and its communion of powerful member states . 
  i can not exclude that nations in the caucasus will follow suit as well , but they are far away from the european heartlands . 
  economic cooperation as in the eea is more likely . 
  yeah , that was pretty obvious when you posted it in this place . 
  then again , there is no single definition on what europe is : only personal interpretations that bundle up in certain common ways to approach the subject of what europe really is . 
  some define it geographically ( as do you ) , others try to do it via arbitrarily interpreting cultural ideas across the continent and finding shared values . 
  and it certainly does n't end there !, 
  just saying : no single approach is wrong , but it is all personal in the end . 
  i dare to say that the vast majority of people here in the netherlands certainly do not consider the caucasus mountain range to lie within europe , just to illustrate how much ideas can differ . 
  i am thinking of making something disgustingly unhealthy for a change , specifically [ arretjescake ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?hl=nl&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=947&amp;q=arretjescake&amp;oq=arretjescake&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.994.2051.0.2234.12.5.0.1.1.0.485.1366.0j3j0j1j1.5.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..7.5.1184.fll8yduei8k ) . 
  the main ingredients are butter , sugar and biscuits and that 's in essence all you need to know . 
  or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metvnekhyom ) . 
  i always love how trey and matt lampoon the japanese . 
  the ending resulted in me being stuck in laughter for over a minute hehe . 
  i guess asking a question is ok as well : what does / r/europe think of the latest south park season ? 
  seems pretty strong so far if you ask me . 
  apparantly erdogan his akp party is doing better than compared to the previous elections . 
  my god , i hope that megalomaniac has n't crossed that sacred boundary and transcended into election fraude . 
  at this point however all options are on the table given erdogan his character . 
  let 's hope for the sake of the turkish people that they do not abolish their own freedom and vote for other parties . 
  ** edit : ** my condolences turkey . 
   also , we are closely connected with germany . 
  if they 're doing well , we should do as well . 
  same here since times immemorial . 
  if germany is doing well , the netherlands mostly follow suit and vice versa . 
   also , i should mention czech nature toward jobs , people work even outside of their specialisation and for lower wages , than they should . 
  to be unemployed is seen as a stigma here ( especially for men ) , so ingeniers and teachers will work as waiters and cashiers if they have to . 
  that 's some good labor mentality you got there : the social stigma is also present here as well , but not as strong as the one you seem to be describing . 
  is it more of a question of personal honour , or does society frown upon you for living on state benefits ? 
  mostly because it is n't visible enough , and because not everyone shares the same pavlov response to these nutcases as compared to neo-nazis . 
  everyone knows what the nazis have done , so the response there is obvious and well imbedded in society . 
  the same does n't apply here , because you of course have the more ` sensitive ' people that want to prevent protesting against something that is protected by freedom of religion and freedom of speech . 
  which this is ** not ** by the way : those people support a radical sect and should be punished harshly . 
  if you ask me how many dutchmen would feel sympathy to people parading around with isis or jihad flags in general you 'll have a hard time finding many : stuff like that is almost universally condemned here among the native dutch population . 
  there was one incident here some time back with people waving isis flags ( or two , if you count some soccer field picture of youths waving one such flag ) and stuff like that is certainly not allowed anymore , if it was ever allowed in the first place . 
  i believe some idiots could wave such flags here in the netherlands because the police were n't nearby or unsure about what to do . 
  that figures . 
  no problem . 
  right wing liberal parties in belgium . 
  first of all : that downvote button is no disagree button . 
  i upvoted you as well , as you actually contribute . 
  in short : we disagree on whether liberalism is ` to blame ' . 
  seemingly we can not come to some kind of compromise about this , but nowhere did i deny that we should ban these nutcases from crusading their intolerant and medieaval ideas in a democratic context . 
  i just wanted to make that clear : i do n't even differ from / u/thelaw90210 on that part . 
  i am ? 
  where exactly ? 
  i actually commended germany on having it 's stuff in order * again * , contrary to many other european nations out there . 
  that part was quite clear - but even then it is imprecise . 
  he is n't wrong when it comes down to the more left wing liberal parties : those indeed show such behavior , even when it has become completely unreasonable to do so !, 
  no disagreement on that part , yet to give the blame to ` liberalism ' ( that being liberalism * in general * ) is just wrong . 
  liberalism might be the most broad political theory out there - and the way it gets implemented differs drastically . 
  take the vvd in the netherlands for example : a rather conservative , right wing , liberal party . 
  the vvd recently even called for a crackdown on salafism ( thank god for that ... ) , something which the liberal-democratic d66 ( centre-left ) would never do . 
  i think the tendency / u/thelaw90210 correctly described is just not an innate characteristic of liberalism , but more relating to rigid left-wing relativism . 
  and even then we are n't quite there yet , yet this comparison is at least more precise . 
  are you really sure ? 
  because he made the link between misplaced acceptance and accommodation of wrong and dangerous views * and * liberalism . 
  as if ` liberalism ' is the cause of all of this . 
  let ` liberalism ' have an almost exclusively left wing , progressive meaning in the us and it 's not hard to see why i reprimanded / u/thelaw90210 on it . 
  next to that , even here on / r/europe ` liberals ' are sometimes used as a synonym for left-wing cultural relativists . 
  you can use ` liberal ' in this context as a shibboleth to recognize people from outside of europe or people that mostly view and read american media . 
  the latter is all fine and all , but it does influence ones world view and in this case it makes it in incorrect compared to what liberalism means in europe . 
  next to that , there are plenty of right wing liberal parties in europe . 
  every comparison with liberalism therefore is inaccurate - that is all i wanted to make clear . 
  better to use different terminology . 
  then i guess the entire nsa scandal never happened .
