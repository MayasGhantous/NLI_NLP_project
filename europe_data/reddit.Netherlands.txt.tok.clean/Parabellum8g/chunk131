  nor is the us extremely wary of even close allies , right ? 
  if you want to look for friends you can trust , there is little point in looking to the other side of the pond : the us is mostly interested in strengthening it 's own position in the world , not strengthening region x ( in this case europe ) . 
  congrats germany : here 's another trophee for your collection . 
  also : i did n't know czech republic was doing this good , kind of impressive . 
  can someone knowledgeable about this comment on it ? 
  do n't use liberalism in the american sense of the word : it goes counter to the position liberalism takes in europe . 
  instead , bash on the left wing , vague as that might be . 
  the misplaced understanding of the problem you describe mostly originates from that corner . 
  ** edit ** : read below . 
  i will also link [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservative_liberalism ) for the sake of argument . 
  the list in the article of right wing liberal parties is n't even complete to be honest , but it gives an impression of how wrong the comment above is . 
  well , all parties above are dutch . 
  all people with dutch citizenship can vote in all elections . 
  people without can only vote on the municipal level . 
  so it is quite the same as in estonia , even though citizens that happen to be first generation immigrants ca n't anyways . 
  edit : corrected earlier reply . 
  bodies full with reinforced arteries , bones filled with light weight concrete and titanium skull plating . 
  just imagine how that would feel !, 
  must i link the relevant reports ? 
  because they factually are the most dangerous here , whether you want to imagine it or not . 
  and if you only use murder as an arbitrary criterium to assess who is most dangerous , instead of violence in general , you are deluding yourself . 
  it reeks of moving the goalposts in order to protect extreme left scum . 
  ` theoretically speaking '  . 
  i 'm not the most positive guy when it comes down to democracy , but this mechanism ` should ' work . 
  indeed . 
  the ballot box can fix the problem / u/gingor described : a government that does essentially everything it wants ( thereby implying that it does things that are highly controversial ) will get punished afterwards . 
   the reform would turn the senate into a 100-member house of regional and municipal representatives with the power to question , but not veto , legislation . 
  so in general italy would after this is completely adopted be more in line with most of europe , correct ? 
  in each case : the senate is in europe almost always the chamber with the least power and mostly functions as a chambre de r\u00e9flexion . 
  i like how this renewed italian senate is even less powerful than the already relatively powerless first chamber here . 
  yes , but you ca n't get around distributing while downloading by using e.g. 
  bittorrent ( unless i 'm missing something here , and i 've used bittorrent for years ) - it 's just part of the system . 
  but people that download via torrents are being left alone here as well : the focus so far has always been on the ` big guys ' - however vague that may sound . 
  apparantly people that upload a lot of protected material are at risk here , but your average guy that downloads a few films at home is n't . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but there is a difference between germany and the netherlands on this part . 
  highly interesting : thanks for adding all of this . 
  the government will not : private entities like warner bros in turn could do so by opening a civil case . 
  imagine that such an organisation - and other large players in the industry - decide to start an offensive . 
  it is not out of this world just because the * current * government wo n't be bothered by it . 
  let 's hope nothing substantial will change . 
  that is n't even the point : popcorn time is available all across europe . 
  also , you should see this in the light of brein its recent statements - which were rather open ended . 
  yes , a dutch student got caught up in this in germany ( duh ) - a shameful thing - yet do n't think for a second that it is impossible that such practices get imported to the netherlands . 
  but really , i just wanted to highlight the 1000 euro fine for such a small infraction of rather outdated legislation . 
  it is beyond ridiculous and could become common good here . 
  it is n't new in germany , yet popcorn time is available everywhere . 
  if you look upon this in the light of recent developments here we are getting a taste of what might happen in the netherlands in the future . 
  what i fear the most is that legislation here will change due to extensive lobbying - lobbying that is probably already going on in the background . 
  as has been the case with the pirate bay ban , internet providers are apparantly the last line of defense . 
  fortunately they are rather activistic in this country , but i wonder if this is going to be enough in the long run . 
  also , imagine that there could be a flood of court cases against individual users in the future : the organisations that pursue such action have sufficiently deep enough pockets to start such a campaign , if only to ` deter ' people . 
  i 'd rather have them maintain that one , or even increase it , than this terrible ` solution ' . 
  stuff like this should be fixed via taxation , not by going after individual users . 
  it is a clear attack to the freedom to exchange data without obstacle , inspired by profit models that are outdated . 
  by the way , did n't sweden or norway have some kind of legislation like that ? 
  that being : compensating authors via taxes instead of introducing some foreign claim culture ? 
  that is the question at this point : i expect that it surely does n't . 
  what this moreover means is that the ` american way ' to deal with this non-problem apparantly gets imported to europe ; that arguably worries me the most . 
  copyright organisations in the netherlands are planning the same . 
  we 've had a long tradition in the netherlands to not go after people that download stuff : only those that distribute it ( even then rarely ) . 
  this is another sign that this might change . 
  edit : fixed some things . 
  i think that if the shit would really hit the fan , merkel would just kick out somewhere below her and replace that person by a new placeholder . 
  at least : merkel does n't seem to be a huge fan of the carrington doctrine , now is she ? 
  yep , noticed the contradiction as well . 
  pretty weird , but larger cities tend to have more resources at their disposal contrary to smaller towns . 
  on the really local level many municipalities seem to be struggling , though that is not really unexpected if you ask me . 
  this is just how brutal reality can be to idealism : many of those mayors will have the same political colour as merkel or are even clearly left-wing , yet reality has caught up with ideology here . 
  for the better of course , but at the same time sad to see that local municipalities have to be at breaking point first before sobering reality sets in . 
  so does bismarck i figure . 
  i imagine there are people in germany today besides the extreme right that would lynch you on the spot if you were ever to say that in public . 
  i personally would reprimand you for your foolishness and your complete lack of respect towards other germans , but stuff like this can even invoke violence . 
  what is most important is how a person can get to such ideas . 
  it really worries me . 
  well , you give me the impression that you only care about extreme right violence . 
  it might surprise you , but over here extreme left groups like the afa are actually by far the most violent . 
  and i 've met my share of germans here who confirm - next to watching the news - that there is a lot of left-wing violence in germany as well . 
  the battle around the ecb headquarters is still fresh in my mind in that regard . 
  i am not telling you that pegida is all right , although rational thought urges me to consider that many pegida supporters are just normal german people that saw no way out besides joining such a club - as discussing this topic in a real way is still not done . 
  and again , i repeat that i feel highly disgusted by you saying that ` all of this ' ( absolute statement ) will come from ` the right ' . 
  it is a statement that is literally drenched in ideological naivity . 
   / r/europe is basically / pol / with usernames at this point . 
  having seen / pol / on a regular basis lately ( a friend of mine visits it often , sadly enough ) and having ridiculed it just as many times , i consider this statement to be very out of line . 
  / r/europe is nowhere near close the level of disgusting that you can find on / pol / , where everyone can freely discriminate and hate at will . 
  moreover , you insult the vast amounts of friendly , moderate users here by basically placing them under the flag of extremism . 
   germany may use army transport planes to send asylum seekers who have had their applications rejected to their ** home countries ** that link is there for reading you know . 
  good , it is inhumane to let people stay too long in a country where they 're not allowed to remain in the first place . 
  the sooner they get sent back the easier it will be for them to adapt back to their prior way of life . 
  apparantly it still happens that people that are n't welcome in schengen country x get physically pushed over the border . 
  this actually happens , yet doing so results in shifting the problem to some other nation in europe . 
  therefore : good move by germany . 
  well , your orientation in general seems to be very left wing . 
  the stuff you get really angry about on / r/europe can often be placed in some traditional left wing corner . 
  also , it is no secret that the left seems to be a lot more hospitable to these migrants/refugees ( how many were refugees again ? 
  ) , thus it is not wrong by default to assume you are . 
  and yes , nazism , like fascism , is a buzzword that is almost completely used out of its historical context nowadays . 
  the same goes for racism , which is used out of its definition as well . 
  it is best to avoid such words and describe the wrongdoing of other people in less ambigious terms . 
  you are completely free to attack people that cross the line - i 'll be the last one to complain about that - but do n't use such terminology at random . 
   fuck off you closet nazis .
