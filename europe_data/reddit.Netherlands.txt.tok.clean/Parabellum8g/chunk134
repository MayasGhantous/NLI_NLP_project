  too soon ? 
  i 'm ok with it though . 
  this could be huge if it happens to be a russian aircraft . 
  but let 's wait and see . 
  edit : a drone was downed , though it could still be russian . 
  apparantly it was taken down after three warnings . 
  nothing before the general elections . 
  maurice de hond has been proven to be wrong in the past , though i 'm not so sure nowadays . 
  the thing is that the way polls are taken is that they are randomized : you can not influence them that way . 
  immigration simply is a ` hot topic ' at the moment , thus the outcome is this . 
  ca n't say i 'm all too happy with it , but i completely understand it at the same time . 
  the simple fact that you start talking about the european union shows that you know very little about stuff like this . 
  the echr is not associated with the european union : it is part of the european convention on human rights and also incorporates many non-eu member states . 
  also , i still find it odd that you equate the opinion of this one dutchman with the opinion of every european . 
  lazy does n't even begin to describe your mistake . 
  i think it is a bit of a stretch to even make that assumption . 
  but freedom of speech has never been unlimited , otherwise we would n't know things like slander for example . 
  that 's for better of course : we do n't disagree on that part . 
  i just were curious if the verdict above would change the moderators ' minds . 
   on a different note , i take it / r/europe its rules on the this subject remain unchanged ? 
  oh , there 's my answer . 
  a truly weird verdict . 
  it raises some interesting questions about whether one can deny the holocaust as well , or more in general if such stupidity should fall under freedom of speech as well . 
  my first impression is ` yes ' , but lowering the bar like this is not the best of ideas . 
  on a different note , i take it / r/europe its rules on the this subject remain unchanged ? 
  his slip of the tongue will obviously be repeated as much as the famous milliband eating a sandwich picture , just to warp the entire discussion in one direction . 
  of course all in good tabloid tradition . 
  mind you : this will happen . 
  heard that as well : iran therefore knows nearly ` no ' prostutition ( yeah right ... ) , because of such legal constructs . 
  never sign the marriage contract people . 
  i 'm warning you : just do n't do it . 
  the chance of failure is too large , while it can have way more negative consequences than say a registered partnership for example in cases where one partner goes bankrupt . 
  forget about societal pressure ( if existent in your country ) and just go for a registered partnership/civil union as an ultimate show of love . 
  same here , otherwise meritocracy could easily lay the framework for tyranny . 
  the people need to be involved in such a system . 
  i like to think of meritocracy as democracy 2.0 . 
  kind of unwarranted that you all out on me like that , as it was meant as a remark towards meritocracy . 
  not a real dictatorship . 
  you sort of missed that it seems  . 
  fair enough . 
  it was a bit of an overstatement if you look upon it in that light . 
  that 's alright : we can all disagree after all . 
  what you say is true : a world without cannabis ( and alcohol for that matter ) would be a healthier one . 
  i 've seen quite a few examples of people that fail to moderate their use of substances . 
  one could of course argue this got a lot to do with personality as well - or genetic disposition - but the truth of the matter will always be that said persons would not be substance dependant without having access to the substance in the first place . 
  i think we should indeed be very wary of the argument about personal freedom , yet your own moral compass still could easily tell you what is right or wrong and moreover what the target society should internally allow . 
  in the end , this debate will always be closely connected to the ideas in your own society about personal freedom . 
  as long as the solution is pragmatic , i 'm all up for it . 
  oh , and sugar rich soda ? 
  it should be banned  . 
  medical use is surely not limited to pain relief for patients with cancer ( although it is most known as a measure against this ) . 
  other uses are the treatment of systems of multiple sclerosis and other illnesses of a more neural nature . 
  next to this you state ` no healthy use outside of ' . 
  the thing is that there is little to none conclusive research that occassional cannabis use has serious drawbacks : as always , moderation is the key in living a healthy life . 
  the thing is that most people consume it combined with tobacco , while there are other way less harmful ways ( e.g. 
  vaporizing ) . 
  i understand that you have gotten tired of the ` alcohol is more harmful ! ', 
  argument , but it remains ** true ** nevertheless . 
  the simple fact that politicians do n't act to it does n't make it less correct . 
  unless you want to challenge the notion that alcohol is more harmful than cannabis itself : in that case you are fighting a losing battle . 
  rest assured , you wo n't find the ` cannabis can do no harm ' type of attitude in my person . 
  it is just that there is so much disinformation spread about throughout the years that is gets on my nerves : we waste precious amounts of public funds combatting the import , export and production of cannabis while there is so little to gain . 
  those funds could be spent otherwise . 
  it is a conclusion i personally do not share , next to being linked to a wider debate of how far personal freedom should go . 
  what i do argue against is that the rules and regulations concerning cannabis are extremely out of line - and moreover a moral crime . 
  we should ban both , or ban neither : that is the main message . 
  since alcohol could never be banned ( society would never accept that ) - and since outlawing drugs is an inefficient tool - only one conclusion remains : legalisation of cannabis . 
  and the list should not even stop there : all drugs that are of somewhat equal damage to society and the human body than alcohol should be treated equally . 
  the dictatorship of the wise will come some day , of that much i am certain . 
  the current system can not perpetuate itself as it will some day drive down a cliff because of this particular flaw we are talking about . 
  whether the reason is destructive war , corruption or misuse of public funds is no importance : how long it is going to take * is * however . 
  i feel like we are wasting valuable time if the status quo gets maintained . 
  scientists are of course humans and not always right , but science as a whole got a much more failproof and thorough system of finding ` the truth ' of the matter compared to any parliamentary system in existence . 
  present day politicians are just as great of an obstacle to the advancement of human wellbeing and innovation than religion used to be in the old days . 
  hah , i read something about the wild growth of dispensaries !, 
  apparantly the quality is n't all that good with * some * of the ` newcomers ' that want to jump into the market , but overall what is being sold seems to be of good and decent quality . 
  also impressive how they arranged for the first 44 million to be spent : politicians there have n't lost their mind yet as it seems . 
  overall it seems a very balanced solution . 
  oh well , the world of idealism tends to do that towards any feelings of realism or pragmatism . 
  scientists tell us that there is a huge discrepancy between the status of alcohol on one side and cannabis on the other , yet so many governments still perpetuate their hypocrisy on this topic . 
  it is stuff like this that makes my blood boil . 
  the answer is obvious : colorado , oregon and washington have all legalised cannabis . 
  i believe in 2 out of 3 of those states , or all of them , you can actually buy cannabis at a dispensary . 
  suppliers are n't punished - something we ** still ** do - thus these us states are more progressive than the netherlands as of 2015 ironic as that might be . 
  also , there is a noticeable opinion shift in the us towards cannabis over the past few years , while we are standing still . 
  / u/mmaaffee is right in so far he is referring to those states and the general turn in public opinion . 
  indeed . 
  i did not oppose the deposition of yanukovich , seeing how he treated his own people , but the way they got rid of him was surely violent . 
  judging the violence of the ukrainian revolution is difficult : it might as well have been a response to violence inflicted upon the demonstrators themselves . 
  calling it a coup may go too far , but a coup and revolution in general both utilize the same approach to ` switch ' governments . 
  i dislike how they could n't pinpoint the exact launch location , but i understand this goes beyond the mandate or powers of the ovv . 
  it 's up to the om * to tell us where that thing was launched and who is likely to be responsible . 
  in my mind i already have a good idea of which government leader got blood on his hands - if only out of command responsibility - but the investigation by the om needs to give those answers . 
  * the om being the body of dutch public prosecutors . 
  edit : ovv chief joustra has just confirmed the buk came from rebel controlled territory , something which he did not say during the press conference earlier today . 
  funny thing is that the eu could 've easily solved the mass influx of mainly fortune seekers way before it became a problem if it would 've been a closer union . 
  ironically the eurosceptists have contributed to this as well : the eu is a nearly impossible compromise as it is . 
  either less powers or more powers to the eu ; one of these scenarios need to be unleashed on the current eu . 
  and let us not assume that the controversial ` help ' to greece was purely decided in brussels .
