  it needed the exclusive backing of all member states , and individual member states in general - specifically the bigger ones like germany - had a near decisive influence when important decisions had to be taken . 
  where are you from if i may ask ? 
  your flair is rather confusing . 
  well well , this is a new one ... 
  aww , british humor at its finest :p . no , it 's more about 179 cm ( or 5 feet 10 or so inches according to island standards ) . 
  what does get me at a disadvantage is half a bloodline that is italian/asian in origin . 
  despite having a normal caucasian skin color i have no problem withstanding extreme heat . 
  the opposite however does not apply : the cold is something i * can * get used to a bit ( i.e. 
  after 10 days of heavy frost or so ) , but in general i 'll still have trouble keeping warm . 
  all other member states besides my own that staged referendums voted yes . 
  does that mean that their votes do not count ? 
  but truth be told , the people should n't be asked complicated questions of such a nature . 
  i think referendums in other western nations has shown us that organising one simply shifts the power of decision from parliament to large media enterprises . 
  the side that maintains the most effective propaganda machine can influence the odds of ` winning ' immensely . 
  also , maybe you should open up a book about international law . 
  in the end , the teu and tfeu are still mere agreements between states . 
  treaties . 
  in international law , citizens are of little importance ( that is just how it is out of the nature of international law ) . 
  a popular mandate is nice and all , but not necessary . 
  but that 's me . 
  i have simply abandoned the ` will of the people ' as some kind of ultimate oracle that is * always * right . 
  why ? 
  the people are often wrong . 
  due to education or due to being easily influenced . 
  by the way , how many functioning democracies are out there in the world that vote by unanimity ? 
  because your ` attack ' on the lisbon treaty seems to imply such support is ` normal ' . 
  if you say so : it 's about 15 degrees where i 'm sitting at the moment and my feet already feel frozen . 
  i think a few drops of scandinavian blood does help though . 
  semantics aside : if you come from a mediterreanean or arid/desert-like climate the harsh scandinavian winter is going to be cold for you . 
  your body just is not tuned to such weather . 
   so your earlier remark is inconsecutive , and therefor a logical fallacy . 
  i fail to see how , and you lack to explain why . 
   so it 's basically a glorified senate . 
  well , the senate is in europe most often the chamber of parliament with the least powers , if not everywhere throughout europe . 
  i think both are evenly matched legally and in practice , but if i 'd had to pick neither could be called a true senate . 
  both are directly involved in creating legislation , not reviewing it for a second time . 
   the eu is n't democratic . 
  perhaps you think it 's democratic , then again , north koreans call their country the ` democratic peoples republic of korea ' , and even belarus has elections , so that 's that . 
  if this is the way you learn , you 'll always stay limited for the rest of your life . 
  sorry , harsh words , but it had to be said . 
  i - against my better conscience - took the time to say that you were wrong in many ways , but you just come back at me and repeat what you said before : ` the eu is n't democratic ' . 
  you have basically ignored everything i said ( probably even plugged your ears ) and did n't even take the time to respond to it . 
  the comparison with north korea , a country not * even remotely * equivalent to how the eu works pretty much finished it all . 
  but i know in which circles such comparisons are popular ( hint : the pvv ) , and your nationalistic name pretty much confirms your convictions . 
  all fine , but do n't make a mockery out of right-wing populism by drawing a false comparison with north korea . 
   so voting done by people who are not my representatives is democratic now according to you . 
  i do n't know if you 're really this stupid or are pretending to be ignorant at this point . 
  the system of democracy is just taking decisions by majority , next to the fact that the people choose their representatives . 
  they however do n't choose the executive in our nation : the second chamber does that . 
  the same goes for the european parliament which gets directly elected . 
  the really hypocritical stuff is that according to you a national government got much more democratic legitimation than the council , while the council in turn forms the representation of the governments of all member states . 
  all of the parties behind those governments were chosen in open and free elections , while when necessary the council decides by qualified majority . 
  if that 's is n't democracy anymore , i do n't know what is . 
  what you fail to understand is that your argument is n't that much against democracy in the eu . 
  i think you are just looking for ways to attack something you very much dislike and - as this discussion did show a bit - lack to understand , but basically you are arguing against ** supranationalism ** concerning the council . 
  but it feels like this discussion will be fruitless : i already detect that you have firmly set your heels into the sand , making any follow up of this discussion useless . 
  i 'll just leave it at this . 
  no , you do n't vote for the council , but our own government is n't that much more democratic than the council : due to the weak dualistic system we have in this country , the government is seldomly held to account . 
  the parliament thus does not rule : most parties in parliament are mainly composed of sockpuppets that will just follow whatever their whip wants - at least when push comes to shove . 
  also , the council is only one part of the equation : european legislation can not come into existence without approval of the european parliament , the same parliament you are ( hopefully ) entitled to vote about . 
  if you want to be anti-eu , that 's all fine , but at least do n't go on the ` the eu is n't democraticccc ' tour : that ` argument ' has gotten old by now . 
  it gets even more ironic if you realize that the council eventually will decide based on qmv , which is just majority rule . 
  in other words : democracy . 
  not to mention that all the ministers sitting on the council are ** in turn ** backed by their own sovereign governments which , according to your reasoning , do have a strong democratic mandate . 
  no matter what direction you start reasoning , you 'll hit that wall each and every time . 
  better discard that argument about the council and democracy and think about some other angle to attack the eu : there are plenty of other , more reasonable options . 
   voting for a parliament that in turn votes the prime minister is still much more direct than the eu right now . 
  that 's the joke : it is n't !, 
  you directly vote the european parliament into power , which in turn needs to confirm the commission president ( that being , the eu 's equivalent of ` prime minister ' ) . 
  the inner workings are very similar , even though there is of course the multinational organ called the european council that has an equal say in the matter as well . 
  i think the main problem with democracy in the eu - besides the massive amount of lies and hypocrisy spread about it from certain circles - has to do with the low turnout during european elections . 
  i believe it 's somewhere around 40-50 % or so , which is way too low given the extensive competences of the eu in many fields of law . 
  as long as this remains low the eu will continue to linger on with a serious democratic deficit . 
  then again , you could say people should vote - and should otherwise not complain . 
  that also means the right to vote against ( i.e. 
  voting for some eurosceptic party that wants to dismantle the eu ) or vote blank . 
  all the criticism of the eu aside , people are pretty lazy when it comes down to european elections . 
  edit : fixed some things, 
   i know plenty of how the eu works . 
  the burden of proof to inform the people properly and show us they are not a bunch of corrupt assess lies solidly with them . 
  no , do n't go in that direction . 
  i * asked * you what she is guilty off , and what proof you have that she did wrong . 
  the burden of proof lies with the party that demands - in this case that being you . 
  excusing yourself from your normal obligation to do some proper research before starting to vent some of your personal ideas about the eu is just pure lazyness . 
  reversed burden of proof my ass : this is n't a banana republic . 
  there are plenty of politicians that have lost all connection with the people , but seeing ` ideas ' like yours makes me think twice about giving the other side what it wants . 
  but hurr durr that is not what i have read on [ insert bad news source ] !, 
  nor do we vote for our government , remember ? 
  i figure that annoys you just as much , as we do not elect our prime minister directly . 
  instead , we vote for a few parties that rotate power throughout the years . 
  welcome to the world of particracy !, 
  so in short , the dutch government does not represent you as well . 
  let 's be plain then and say it both out loud . 
  no , it is called being fair . 
  and the responses in this topic show that politicians better not be honest , ironically enough . 
   dismantle the fucking european project and put this woman in jail where she belongs . 
  she does ? 
  according to which legal provisions ? 
  moreover , what did she do wrong in a moral sense ? 
  you can be against ttip all you want - i have reservations about it as well - but downright plebeian nonsense like this ca n't be taken seriously .
