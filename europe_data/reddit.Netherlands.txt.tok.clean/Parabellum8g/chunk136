  study how the eu works and then come back here to enlighten us again . 
  i ca n't even remember whenever this sub was pro-refugee . 
  maybe a year ago at the last , probably even further back in time than that . 
  this sub is radically anti-migrant/refugee nowadays . 
   to me it 's good to see we have one last figure of integrity that wo n't bow to the rushed prejudice of personal insecurity all around . 
  criticism on merkel goes beyond this : the simple fact that over a million people from culturally extremely different countries are moving towards germany rightfully makes other germans feel insecure . 
  policies as practiced by germany today hurt people in their very personal identity . 
  ` national pride ' is still something in existence in every european nation and is closely linked to that identity , even though we like to downplay the existence of national pride in general ( due to the link with nationalism ) . 
  this identity gets diluted by the ` multicultural society ' - that one that never existed by the way - and people can rightfully resist to that . 
  what i do not respect are the people that resist immigration based on racist or other completely unacceptable grounds . 
  to be frank , quite a few people i spoke to about this subject turned out to be closet racists , yet at least as many people just dislike the dilluting of what it means to be a people . 
  the un charter is a mere piece of paper that binds states . 
  those ideas may reach the status of ` law ' in some nations , depending on the constitutional order of said nations , but that does not imply that the people share those ideas . 
  that is where you go wrong : you project those agreements between states as being the will of the peoples behind the signing states . 
  * it is not * , that much is the hard truth all over europe - a truth that gets anxiously downplayed by those in power . 
  principles are good and all , but should rarely be given some kind of absolute status . 
  even principles can be cast aside if the decision that goes against them as such is well motivated and defendable . 
  we should get rid of this idea that idealism is somehow higher in standing than pragmatism , especially seeing to what madness idealism leads . 
  germany is testimony to that as of today . 
   but * all * we 're ever presented are short sighted imaginations of catastrophe . 
  an absolute statement , therefore not to be taken seriously . 
   we need a strong reminder of this , all together . 
  and the current situation is one , a challenging one , but not an impossible one . 
  no , what you want is that your ideas prevail and in trying to succeed in doing so you present those ideas as being rightful and moreover as just . 
  that is again where you go wrong : it surely is n't as clear cut . 
  i have to say , that is some sublime bait . 
  but to some extent you are right as well . 
  it is sad to see how people protest against the necessary sacking of thousands to prevent a bankruptcy of air france somewhere in the future , or a hostile takeover for a dime . 
  it is ridiculous really . 
   ephebophilia is the primary or exclusive adult sexual interest in mid-to-late adolescents , generally ages 15 to 19 ehm , i fail to see the link here ? 
  the questions asked in general - if based on the last poll - are anything but weird . 
   ephebophobia that one does n't occur in my dictionary . 
  to which terryfing thing are you referring if i may ask  ? 
  it does , but said data can and probably will be used for intelligence goals as well . 
  therefore all personal data that i.e. 
  facebook exports out of europe ends up on some nsa/cia server as well . 
  this verdict ends that particular route , while another one stays open . 
  that 's what i was referring to in the margin of this verdict . 
  a valid concern , though a bit hyperbolic . 
  a ruling class or ` elite ' is something in existence in every political system , whether democratic or dictatorial . 
  the thing is that ` the people ' in itself is some sort of abstraction , as ` the people ' can be split up into numerous less abstract groups . 
  in a democracy it is impossible to please everyone - nor in any other system of government that has been tried so far - thus the problem you described will remain at the core of democracy . 
  to be precise , this problem is one of most serious flaws of democracy itself . 
  but as stated before , it is not alone in this . 
  you 're right : nowadays democracy is being used as a synonym for justice just too often . 
  democracy refers to the rule of the people by the people : it does not go much broader than that . 
  the separation of powers in itself does not even have to be based on democracy , which is arguably the most amusing part . 
  it is true that many if not nearly all democracies are states of law , but for a state of law to exist a democratic system is surely no requirement . 
  therefore this verdict should just be called ` justice ' or whatever flashy term to describe the undoing of wrongdoing . 
  today 's victory was brought to us all ** by ** the cjeu and the cjeu ** alone ** : we would do eu member states way too much honor by celebrating their lack of action throughout the years . 
  good verdict , but it may not achieve the goals that were outlined . 
  i expect that european intelligence services will just circumvent this verdict via the backdoor and export all relevant data to the us if required . 
  this verdict could therefore be considered to have little impact as long as there is no real ban on the mass exportation of metadata about european citizens between intelligence services . 
  edit : i could n't care less about private companies . 
  for me it is way more important to know what governments do with the information gathered by said private companies . 
  in particular the us govt of course . 
  this : that is what it is !, 
  you see this all over the western world by now : the electorate being disillusioned by the people that represent them , which in turn results in populist parties all over the place . 
  it is a worrying development that is very dangerous to democracy in the long term . 
  in other words , laws do n't need to be respected if one wants to fight ` the elite ' . 
  you do understand that this smells like anarchism , this contempt you show versus very relevant sections of criminal law ? 
  excellent strawman : congratulations . 
  good point . 
  i think i can live in a country dominated by the use of a soft g . but that 's a matter of personal taste . 
  or innocent truckers from abroad suffering a more terrible fate if they happen to cross through france when the farmers are striking . 
  france is so extremely fucked up when it comes down to ` protests ' ( let 's just call it what it is , * downright * ** violence ** ) . 
  the worst part is arguably that more than an exotic minority condones such vigilante actions . 
  the french government should crack down on it hard , if necessary with force . 
  such people should be tried for assault and punished accordingly . 
  the end of the civilized world is in sight whenever the most basic of laws no longer get respected . 
  i think this little part of the netherlands got more than enough industry and a well developed service sector to keep its head above the water ( pun intended ) . 
  oh damn , i 'm starting to sound like a real separatist now !, 
  and if the west and north drowns i could n't care less to be honest . 
  at least i 'm high and dry here in the comfortable landscape of brabant . 
  it actually is the better version in my view , but hey i 'm just a backwards southerner . 
  maybe it 's time to puncture all those dykes : the zuiderzee will rise again . 
  not anymore : it died somewhere a long time ago . 
  i believe marken ( edit : specifically the dyke connecting it to the mainland ) is the only remnant of a former plan to polder another stretch of sea as large as flevoland . 
  is it comparable to the 200k version though ? 
  because that one focused much more on political convictions for example . 
  it would be interesting to see how this all developed throughout the years on / r/europe . 
  though i do n't really agree with how you put it ( i.e. 
  the absolute truth that secular values in the middle east can * only * work by means of a dictatorship ) , it is ironic to see how so many turks have simply abolished their own state of law via the ballot box . 
  it is stuff like that which reaffirms my doubts about democracy in general . 
  i 'm completely open about it : at this point i am just hoping for a bloodless coup d'etat in turkey to restore it to its secular values . 
  if the current charade keeps going on turkey will destroy itself among ideological and ethnic lines - a fate it does not deserve . 
  to all the mods : congratulations . 
  about that survey : could you tell us a bit about which questions are going to be asked ? 
  we are very close to 500k at this pace of growth , and i wonder if it will more resemble the one taken at 200k subscribers . 
  yep , there 's quite a bit of differences between europe and the other side of the pond on stuff like this . 
  though many more similarities than quite a few people want to admit . 
  it got a very negative ring to it in europe and is still recognized as one of the main instigators of the second world war , as well as the first world war to one extent . 
  nationalism gets quickly seen as jingoism . 
  not to say that europeans are n't proud of their respective nations , but the word nationalism tends to be replaced by some other term to describe their love for the nation . 
  interesting read : the author makes a lot of sense , though he strongly leans on zizek his opinion . 
  it gives some different perspective on the entire refugee influx . 
  he basically calls for strong assimilation , something anyone still in touch with reality could hardly disagree with . 
  no need to downvote : it just seemed like you missed it because you actually took the guy his deliberate misportrayal of the more radical opponents as his own opinion . 
  i think you missed the / s part . 
  edit : to clarify , it seems like the person above actually criticized radical opponents of immigration by ridiculising their overly hyperbolic warnings .
