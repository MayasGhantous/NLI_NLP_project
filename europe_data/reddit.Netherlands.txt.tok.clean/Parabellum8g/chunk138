  above all : calm down . 
  you are n't gaining anything this way . 
  i wanted to make a remark about turks and kebab , but i 'm not so sure anymore after that last part : / . 
  could you expand a little on this ? 
  i 'm very interested in right wing politics in austria , so any description about how it all works there would be welcome . 
  does n't have to be long : if need be only the basics . 
  i think it 's mostly a heritage of the past : j\u00f6rg haider could rightfully be called far right during his lifetime , and it was ` his ' party if i 'm not mistaken . 
  then there 's the inside view that / u/sukrim gave . 
  well this was to be expected . 
  as long as the left remains obsessed with identity politics and does n't have a firm position among the working class this is the logical result . 
  and quite frankly , i think that was deserved . 
  ah , the classic version . 
  i actually liked that cult movie . 
  out of my legal background i consider it curious that the makers decided to combine the profession of police officer , judge and executioner in one entity . 
  indeed very much like a moderator on some internet forum  . 
  upvoted for the sake of argument , but my god this piece is horrendous . 
   in terms of structure the eu is inherently undemocratic in two main ways . 
  the first is that we the citizens of the eu are subject to the implementation of legislation which we are democratically unable to influence and change . 
  - i guess representative democracy - flawed as it is though - got no value to the author in question . 
  both the individual ministers of the council are part of the ruling parties that in turn got elected . 
  the european parliament gets elected in direct elections . 
   we are expected to obey laws which we did not agree to which you did , or to be precise ` your government ' did . 
  the governments of all eu member states ratified the lisbon treaty . 
  at that point onwards , all regulations ` imposed ' by brussels are the direct result of treaty obligations . 
   the second way the eu damages our national democracies in terms of its systematic structure takes the form of what i like to call the eurocracy . 
  this group is a difficult group to simplify but i would describe them as the unelected establishment involved in policy making and implementation of those policies that are at the core of the european union . 
  often these people are those that are closest to the elected officials and have the most influence over them . 
  if this is an attack at lobbying i 'd say this is not unjust : there is too much meddling going on in the background , and the eu has been called ` neoliberal ' because of it . 
  the sheer amount of lobbyists in brussels is proof to that . 
  if the author is arguing against expertise and technocracy/meritocracy in general , i politely ask him to rethink his position . 
   i would have less disdain towards these individuals , who happen to be extremely capitalist , if they were open to public discussion and debate . 
  however it is the sad truth that they have a distinct hatred for citizen 's opinions and never take them on board . 
  it is thoroughly frustrating that they seem to be of the belief that they know what is best with us a hundred percent of the time -- which obviously is not the case . 
  that is a huge threat to our democracies , when one person is more important than another in the eyes of the law and politics . 
  this smells like some kind of ` the elites ' strawman . 
  also , it is inherent to democracy , hell to almost every political system in history , that there are those that have more power than the average individual . 
  this is to be considered normal , although everyone ought to be equal before the law . 
  there are many countries where this does not always seem to be the case . 
   it is also greatly unfair that eu directives instantly become law all across europe without any real discussion or debate . 
  how can we trust such a system which could lead to the death of democracy ? 
  it was debated : in the council ( which is direct member state influence ! ), 
  and in the european parliament . 
  also , if something is highly controversial you can always resort to the yellow ( or even orange ) card . 
  of course , if most member states do n't share you opinion you 'll have to go with it . 
  that 's ** democracy as well ** , but the author refuses to admit this . 
  i 'm not even going to comment on the rest of this diatribe : the author clearly is looking for excuses to crusade against the eu - that 's all . 
  maybe some of the extreme right guys that brigade this place can fill in the role of the white walkers . 
  seems fitting : ice cold , remorseless and very dedicated to their own cause !, 
  this . 
  he 's a nuanced guy , but way too convinced about himself being right and pretty outspoken about his ideas . 
  we need persons of more neutral character , very much judge-like . 
  congratulations to all . 
  let the game of thrones begin . 
  please point out where you find black and white reasoning above , as i 'm not really a two dimensional thinker . 
  i simply stated that i prefer the western world over russia : that is - in short - a judgement call . 
  you must be fun at parties . 
  leave it to some internet nutjob to turn a picture about a snowy parliament into a muslim hating message . 
  you people are truly beyond redemption . 
  indeed : you really put my sentiment into words here . 
  in the middle of march 2017 , we 'll have our own elections here . 
  i wonder how the freedom party of geert wilders ( pvv ) will fare then . 
  a landslide victory in not to be expected ( we are more down to earth for that ) , but a major gain in seats is everything but unexpected . 
  agreed : i 've noticed how people tend to be more oblivious about how the world works , and moreover , what the use is of rational thinking in politics . 
  trump is proof to this : feelings over reality , at the cost of society . 
  but does n't explain all of it : this preference to vote on someone that promises the impossible is directly related to the undermining of the working classes and the standard of living in general . 
  the times of huge economic growth in the west is over , wages and pensions are under pressure and it has n't really gotten easier for young people . 
  we live in a world where everything is possible : nothing seems out of our reach . 
  this atmosphere , where past experiences of the populace with bad leaders are nearly completely if not fully eroded , could create major conflict contrary to lessons of the past . 
  i fear people have to learn about the consequences of their actions , and this time , the price might be astronomically high . 
  let 's hope it will not happen . 
  let 's hope trump will be a pragmatic delegator that shows america and the world the way . 
  but today i am deeply , deeply ** cynical ** . 
  he 's probably right . 
  the world is changing . 
  the change however started in europe oddly enough , with the rise of populist parties , and moved to the us since last year . 
  we are at the eve of something grand , something awful maybe . 
  that 's certainly not the message here : the world will become more * unstable * and moreover , * impredictable * . 
  this poses a major danger to everyone and he makes a point . 
  i 'm not saying war will happen : that 'd be nonsense . 
  i 'm just saying the odds of it have just increased . 
  did the thought come up she might 've been talking about no-fly zones in a un sense , as it has almost been in the case of official no-fly zones ? 
  because in a legal sense , the us can not impose no-fly zones over syria , let alone shoot down russian fighters . 
  it would give russia a valid cause for self defense and a possible casus belli . 
  really , everybody is talking about ` no-fly zones ' but i have this really strong damn impression they 're just parroting something some random dude on the internet said ( at least , in connection to the thing being likely to result in war with russia ) . 
  as such a thing starts to multiply it also gains in credibility , ending up where we are now . 
   trump has never said he would pull out of syria , so i do n't know where you are getting that from . 
  which makes any argument in favor of trump as a peace dove and hillary as some kind of ruthless warhawk less valid . 
  still , this narrative seems to be quite persistent among the pro-trump camp , without justification . 
  trump might just as well be caught up in world war 3 , as there 's no place on earth where russia and the us are closer involved in conflict than syria . 
  obviously , that 's the reason why syria gets mentioned here .

  [ there you go ] ( http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/obama-admin-blames-putin-russia-interfering-presidential-election-leaking-scandalous-dnc-emails/ ) . 
  here 's [ another one ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/obama-russia-hack-election.html ) . 
  but really , this is common knowledge . 
   i mean i 'm not surprised that the obama administration is attacking russia , they need a good pretext for any future potential conflict , but as far as i know there is no actual evidence of russian cyber attacks . 
  conspiracy theory , backed up with denying obvious evidence . 
  it requires distrust , huge distrust , to come to such a conclusion . 
  the evidence is lacking though , as always with conspiracy thinkers . 
  quite confronting to put it that way , but that 's what it boils down to : ignoring facts in favor of theories that belong in the world of fantasy - or at least border on it . 
   so now you are literally justifying it .
