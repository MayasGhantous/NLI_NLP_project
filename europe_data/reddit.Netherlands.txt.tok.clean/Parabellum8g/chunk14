  people will * want * to bend the ideas of god in a version that fits them personally . 
  also , there are a lot of denominations within protestantism , and the most open minded christians that i 've met to date happened to actually be protestant . 
  but to move towards your position a bit : dogma and doctrine do standardize the interpretation of the ` teachings of god ' to some extent , but in the end it is just a collective opinion . 
  one that could go out of the window next year , as long as there is the will to do so . 
  is it really ? 
  you seem to have an orthodox attitude when it comes down to interpretating scripture , and it goes without saying that not everyone shares that opinion . 
  as a matter of fact however , i do agree with you to some extent : whenever something is ` plain ' - how difficult to grasp that concept might even be in ` theology ' - then people should refrain from extensively interpreting a given passage . 
  ignorant ? 
  no , more rather elitist when it comes down to talking about religion . 
  i have a habit of doing that , as i take some joy in degrading holy books as just another category of existential poetry . 
  i could not care less about the catholic church its position on homosexuality , as the catholic church is out of reality on a multitude of subjects . 
  maybe the cowards in the hague actually got a flash of inspiration and gave orders to cripple that russian sub . 
  indeed , it is really rare for the nos to be inaccurate when it comes down to such topics . 
  they have this really conservative - let 's - check - everything - three - times - before we post it - approach . 
  that is the fun part : what * is * exactly written down in the bible ? 
  that 's the issue , and that pretty much nailed it for me . 
  thus i decided to be an atheist , simply because everything is so open to ** interpretation ** . 
  doctrine is nothing less than ( in this case ) a few dozen old men agreeing on the same interpretation of a few lines of text . 
  the fun part is that with some craftyness another provision from the bible could be used to reason that homosexuality itself should be allowed and accepted . 
  so basically , whatever the clergy proposes is * always * written down in the bible . 
  it only demands a certain amount of tunnel vision and rigid ( counterintuitive ? ), 
  reasoning . 
  alright , then at least my understanding of the eci is not lacking . 
  this is nothing else than the citizen 's initiative that we have over here in the netherlands . 
  multiple subjects have been placed on the agenda of the second chamber ( the dutch house of commons ) , but most of the time any ideas were swiftly discarded . 
  the problem with this kind of direct democracy is that the citizen gets upgraded to a mere adviser , which severely limits direct democracy . 
  referendums are still the way to go if you ask me , as long as they are a bit restrictive in nature to prevent every well organised group from constituting some kind of mob rule . 
  wait : do i summarize it correctly when i say that citizens have * a chance * of getting rid of unwanted legislation if , and only if , * the ep and the council * would agree with such a proposal ? 
  because that is what i 'm fighting against , as citizens ( but correct me if i am wrong ) can only place something on the commission 's agenda . 
  it is a step in the right direction , but still too limited in its scope at this point . 
  citizens should be able to completely kill off eu legislation , whenever they feel that something is a bad development . 
  as far as i know , the eci does n't provide the tools for doing so ( yet ) . 
  thanks man !, 
  gon na watch . 
  thanks for giving your view on it . 
  finnish society really is admirable when it comes down to education , that much is for sure . 
  sadly we still have a shortage of teachers down here , so it will be very hard to implement such a plan . 
  maybe we can turn the tide by offering higher wages to teachers that have certain extra qualities , but i do n't see that happening . 
  although we apparantly send a delegation to finland now and then , so who knows . 
  always interesting to see how this kind of topic once again proves the disparity between ` nationality ' and ` cultural allegiance ' . 
  being ` british ' by virtue of having a british passport just does n't cut it . 
  sure , for now it turned out to be the best thing to do . 
  maybe it * will * remain the better option until the days of the euro have ended . 
  however , i will not forget how much of a tumble the pound sterling was taking before the crisis took hold of europe . 
  a few more years , and britain would indeed have likely let go of its own currency . 
  but indeed : the uk can be glad it did n't after all , although it goes without saying that the eurocrisis has influenced the uk regardless . 
  what would improve the credibility of brussels is just more transparancy and above all : more democracy . 
  but this is a catch 22 , as that would require an even stronger european parliament with more british political heavyweights . 
  because that sounds too awkward , britain will probably stay in this uneasy relationship with the eu . 
  though in many ways i consider the more technocratic approach of the eu to be superior to the * mob appeasing tactics * employed by many national governments , including cameron 's administration . 
  i 'll just be plain and speak my mind : the average voter has no idea what 's good for him , so any public upheavel should by default be taken with a pinch of salt . 
  the best way to remedy too much eu interference is incorporating more direct democracy in the shape of referendums , though with a high enough threshold to prevent a flood of referendums for just about every controversial subject . 
  you could n't really expect otherwise , even despite earlier news that a ` shift ' was taking place . 
  whenever the catholic church feels threatened in its teachings , it almost always resorts back to reactionary opinions . 
  in a way i understand that they do n't want to incorporate secular teachings , given how the lobby of some of those organisations can be really annoying and morally lecturing . 
  everyone should be equal , but in the end these men take their own decisions . 
  on a more important note : i do n't even understand why this such an issue . 
  if you happen to be religious , then hop on to another christian denomination that is more accepting . 
  i have heard that teachers apparantly enjoy the same status as commercial air line pilots or surgeons when it comes down to their status on the social ladder . 
  is this correct ? 
  because over here people that want to become a teacher are really - sadly - being frowned upon a bit . 
  there is a lack of respect for teaching , maybe in the first place because of ever growing intervention of parents that believe they know better in just about every situation . 
  lavrov is crafty enough to find some way out . 
  but when push comes to shove , it will be fingerpointing to the west again . 
  probably something close to ` you sabotaged our peaceful sub ' . 
  i wonder if they happen to have a captain that speaks with a scottish accent and makes them sing the soviet anthem on the bridge . 
  because fuck stealth measures . 
  it is a type of runaway defense mechanism . 
  it has really been on the rise over here in the netherlands as well , with people already predicting which ` ethnic minority ' the unknown perpetrator to a certain crime belongs to before it is known to the public . 
  what is more shocking is that people apparantly think they * must * be right in their wild guesses , while they lack the evidence to make such serious statements . 
  also , what davidswiftie13 is doing here is a complete overreaction on how the failed multicultural society works . 
  there is no multicultural society in this world that accepts serious crimes like this , even if ( and that we completely do not know ) it was born out of culture . 
  rome statute , article 8bis section 1 :  for the purpose of this statute , `` crime of aggression '' means the ... , constitutes a ** manifest violation of the charter of the united nations ** so , in response to your cherry picking i could say that you probably purposely neglected to mention section 1 , which says that it should be a manifest violation of the charter of the united nations . 
  i can assure you , that the us , france and britain , 3 of the permanent members in the unsc , do not consider this a violation of the charter of the un . 
  of course , it is up to the judges of the icc to say whether or not something is ( in ) consistent with the charter of the un , but the position of states in this regard will matter to some extent . 
  the purpose of the charter of the un is to provide for a safer world , and isil does not belong in such a world , nor genocidal maniacs of the likes of assad - even though the latter was not targeted . 
   the problem of the international law is usually not the interpretation ( this is as difficult as any other legal source ) but the consequences . 
  i agree completely , but this has nothing to do with whether or not international law is pliable or not . 
  the consequences follow the decision , and the question is whether the decision and any actions following it are legal . 
   there is no possible scenario in which mh17 was down without ukrainian army involvement . 
  no - possible - scenario . 
  impossible . 
  zero percent . 
  excluded . 
  not of this world . 
  if you want to go ahead and talk in absolutes like that , then you indeed are not worth my time . 
  granted : it is an option , one that we do n't even dare to exclude in the west . 
  contrary to what you are doing here , which goes against the will to find out the truth . 
  if russia , directly or indirectly , is behind this , than vladimir putin should be dragged in front of the icc . 
  this will likely remain a dream , but indicting him will surely break down his image for good . 
   the law is the law of course , and if we are making juridical analysis we should operate with legal concepts and principles . 
  to this i agree partially . 
  what you seem to steer at is the vision that international law should be predictable to some extent . 
  this is true for most international law , but completely not the case when it comes down to intervention and self-defense . 
  there are multiple , completely opposing doctrines in this part of law . 
  the ones i am talking about are irreconcilable . 
   chechnya was n't a state , because of that international law applies only in it 's humanitarian aspects . 
  that is open to discussion ( i will not push you in a corner and start about kosovo as a rather equivalent example ) , but lets say that you are right . 
  even then , russia grossly violated humanitarian law in the chechen wars . 
  i 'm not saying that the chechens were innocent given the serious armed struggle that took place there , but russia as the most mature of the belligerent parties should have known better .
