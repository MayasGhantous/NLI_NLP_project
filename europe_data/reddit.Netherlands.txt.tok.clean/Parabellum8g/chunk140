  if the uk would get away with a ` better deal ' than the other eu nations , that would spell the end of the eu . 
  there has been too much political faith put into this project to make that a reality , thus the eu at some point will likely take in a position where economical damage is taken for granted in order to ensure the survival of the eu . 
  bad news for my country though , as we are a major trading partner to the uk . 
  it sounds twisted in a way though , but it let me stress that access to the internal market should not be taken for granted . 
  the uk will likely have to concede on the four freedoms in the end after all . 
  yeah of course , i was just being cynical in that sense . 
  it goes without saying you deserve the very best , in or out of the eu . 
  i just hope it wo n't be a financial and economical disaster , but let 's see what miss may will manage to draw out of the fire . 
  sorry england , but your demise will be a long and drawn out process i fear . 
  a coup de grace is far away at this point . 
  how about a bottle of scotch ? 
  indeed , no ticket to heaven for that guy according to his faith - or at least the extreme subset of it he abided to . 
  suicide will ensure he 'll burn in hell , so i hope he did n't hang himself with the idea of going to heaven . 
  still , it 's a screw up by the prison guards : they did n't pay enough attention apparantly , despite him being on suicide watch . 
  it remains funny to see what that party 's name [ really means in dutch ] ( https://translate.google.com/#nl/en/pis ) . 
  i think that says it all . 
  come on now , no need to take on that victim role . 
  the uk will be judged by its actions , the same applies to the eu and other nations in europe . 
  for a briton you 're awfully easily offended . 
  ** edit : ** yes you are , and seemingly you 're not the only one . 
  what a victim mentality , my god ... 
  downvotes for saying something completely factual . 
  that 's the reddit hivemind for you when it comes down to cannabis . 
  hur dur the herb can do no wrong !, 
  - reddit on average . 
  it 's also a common myth that it 's less dangerous than alcohol and cigarettes : the number of addicts/problematic users out of a hundred is relatively similar to alcohol and smoking a joint equals smoking a few cigarettes , if not more than that when it comes down to the damage to your lungs . 
  and lets not even start about the psychosocial issues that follow with it . 
  a real user should know this stuff . 
  it 's more of subdivision of the liberalism family . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservative_liberalism ) not particularly common though , with the rare exception of the european mainland . 
  public order most likely : the vvd wishes to see a strong state apparatus capable of tackling any infraction of the law . 
  legalizing cannabis from their point of view equals conceding defeat , which is why the vvd is so resolved about this . 
  not to mention the diplomatic side of legalisation : germany in particular will ** not ** be amused , and that 's something the government would have to deal with as well in that case . 
  that 's why it might seem interesting to maintain the status quo ( as the vvd wants ) instead of changing the system . 
  i disagree with that notion by the way , but their point of view does make sense if you know where they 're coming from . 
  however , it can also not be excluded that the vvd views the working population as an entity that needs to be kept in perfect shape - and anything undermining the productivity of that population could therefore considered to be a threat . 
  more of a neo ` drugs are bad , mkay ! ', 
  attitude , specifically aimed at guarding public health . 
   yeah and everyone near the border is buying from nl . 
  this just proved my point which will not change no matter how our policy will look like 1 year from now . 
  he does have a point in that sense : german citizens will also highly likely ( just like any other non-nationals ) be excluded from buying drugs here . 
  that 's already a fact as of present . 
   because nl would become drug hotspot of all neighboring countries , thus rendering these countries laws ineffective . 
  maybe interesting : that 's why the government is against . 
  prime minister rutte has remarked on this , saying that he ` almost ca n't come face to face with merkel and hollande as all that garbage originates from here ' . 
  the government is aware of the possible diplomatic consequences of such a measure , let 's keep it at that . 
  although that begs the question : how could change ever come to pass if everyone keeps looking to his/her neighbour for action ? 
  it wo n't happen on an eu level , nor on a general international level . 
  that more or less ensures nation states have to first irritate others in order for change to happen . 
  although schengen does have some ( limited ) provisions for border controls , which our direct neighbours could enforce if we start to legalize cannabis . 
  i imagine this news will be met with conspiracy theories . 
  still , it is extremely clumsy ( to say the least ) to make such mistakes around elections . 
  in your defense : it was n't an aggressive war to start out with . 
  it was a proportional response to a regime that sheltered terrorists , including those directly linked to 9/11 . 
  in an age of assymetrical warfare the invasion of afghanistan was justified . 
  honestly , i think most people are just confused between the iraq war ( which was utterly illegal ) and the war in afghanistan whenever this gets brought up . 
  a commission in my country did rule the war in afghanistan was illegal under international law though , but i consider that to be less relevant in this case . 
  it just was n't a war of aggression if you look at how it was waged . 
  he 's fully wrong as correctly demonstrated by / u/lookingfor3214 . 
  still 12 upvotes though . 
  it 's telling about the general level in topics like these . 
  thank you for clearing it up . 
  it certainly is n't : lack of remorse is an important factor in deciding the measure of punishment , which is why i 'm quite surprised no lengthier sentences have been handed out . 
  although i expect them to be separated accordingly in prison , to prevent them from ` turning ' other inmates . 
  indeed , in the dark ages . 
  i believe we have passed those stages of savagery , fortunately . 
  not to mention the contradictionary ` lesson ' such a punishment would be . 
  choudary in itself is a savage , but why should we punish him in equally savage ways ? 
  think about that . 
  although he should 've gotten more in my opinion , yet i 'm oblivious to what the maximum punishment to these kinds of crimes is in the uk . 
  maybe / u/trucidator is willing to lend a hand ? 
  or someone else knowledgeable of uk law ? 
  ** edit : ** if people can not see the sheer irony in hanging , drawing and quartering is supporters versus what we are supposed to fight , it is hopeless i guess . 
  it is in short sad to see how so many of us would like to switch to is-like punishments to make a point . 
  for god sake , ** we ** are the civilized ones . 
  read this ( excerpt from reuters article ) :  `` when black people in britain are 28 percent more likely to be exposed to air pollution than their white counterparts , we know that * environmental inequality is a racist crisis . 
  * '' link to [ reuters article . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britishairways-delays-iduskcn11c0de?il=0 ) you just ca n't imagine people making this up anymore , yet it happens . 
  as if they 're grasping for any argument in reach , no matter how bizarre or obscene . 
  well you 've read it here : environmental inequality is a ** racist ** crisis . 
  apparantly . 
  indeed , yet the admins still refuse to give that option so far . 
  it 's frustrating , as i believe a * real * way to turn off the downvote button will increase the atmosphere in many subreddits by a lot . 
  most importantly : the downvote button - at least for comments - is an utterly flawed mechanism . 
  it completely depends on the whims of those using it , and especially in subs like these where heated debates often take place it 's a bad idea . 
  passion tends to overrule civility after all . 
  the admins ( you listening / u/spez ? ), 
  should * at least * give the option of turning it * off * for subreddits . 
  that way everyone can be happy . 
  depends on the situation . 
  i 'm not that interested in uncompromising attitudes and - isms in general . 
  if something does n't work in general you should be willing to throw it away , whether it be a machine or an idea . 
  of course there should be certain minimum boundaries ( think of the most * basic * of human rights ) , however for me the right to asylum in its current form is n't one of them . 
  maybe merkel and those that support her will find out when the damage has been done already . 
  i 'm saying ` when the damage has been done ' , as history will likely repeat itself with respect to integration difficulties . 
  difficulties that still persist to this day . 
  according to exit polls the afd surpassed the cdu . 
  this is pretty painful to say the least , yet this disaster was created at merkel 's drawing table . 
  if you ignore the wishes of a large percentage of the population , do n't be surprised if they 'll turn against you when push comes to shove .
