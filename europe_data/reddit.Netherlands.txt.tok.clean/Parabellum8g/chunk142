  most important is this maybe : it 's difficult to completely disconnect ` religion ' from individual believers . 
  although it goes without saying there are huge social problems with muslims of immigrant descent across europe . 
  i just do n't think banning certain pieces of clothing or even books is the way to solve those problems . 
  and by doing so , you 're doing a huge disservice to anti-theists , and moreover , atheists in general . 
  it 's an annoying attitude i 've come across with multiple non-believers , and as an atheist myself i always feel ashamed when i see it . 
  let people live their lives as they see fit , within the boundaries of the law and good taste . 
  live and let live . 
  you can detest islam like me and still believe that is the right course of action . 
  it was more of a vacation home for our family , though it was really sparingly used throughout the years . 
  it used to belong to my great-grandmother in italy : my grandfather and his brother inherited the place after she passed away ( both are italian as well , me only being quarter ) . 
  my parents were n't exactly there for a ` holiday ' : we still had to settle some things regarding my grandfather 's inheritance in italy so my parents and my grandmother headed off to italy right before the quake . 
  i believe my grandmother knew the ground was already shaking for months there ( something the local populace was pretty anxious about ) by account of a local woman and family friend we 've known for decades now , yet they still decided to go . 
  they were there one night when the earthquake struck . 
  as far as i know there was zero compensation for what happened because they were n't inhabitants of the region ( my entire family lives in the netherlands ) so in a financial sense it was n't the prettiest of events . 
  but at the same time they very much knew it was * much * worse for the locals that had to live with the aftereffects of the earthquake . 
  both my parents have had a strong deja vu about that event after what happened today , at least so it seems after talking to them about what happened . 
  some things never go away apparantly , as that event left lasting memories surrounded with a lot of emotion . 
  silvio berlusconi , the master of tact . 
  apparantly this quake was very similar to the one that struck l'aquila some years back and was shallow as well . 
  even a magnitude 6.0 can indeed come over as a much stronger earthquake in that case . 
  then there 's of course the state of the mostly ( older ) houses there . 
  my good old parents happened to be about 10 kilometers from l'aquila at the time : they nearly perished in the house our family still had there . 
  the ceiling came down , there were holes in the roof and a day later , the house semi collapsed . 
  it fully collapsed afterwards . 
  they were rather lucky to have survived . 
  i can still remember that call from italy with the choppers constantly flying over in the background . 
  it was a warzone there back then , so i imagine the people caught up in this earthquake today will be having similar experiences . 
  not to mention the traumatic aspect : both my parents slept with the lights on for weeks afterwards , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  that one day a year  . 
  if news reports about some event in vladivostok would for example be able to reach the frontpage on this subreddit we might as well call it / r/eurasia instead of / r/europe . 
  most of the ` borderline ' cases i 've come across here are indeed pretty borderline : there 's at least a strong connection to europe for example in proximity , or significance . 
  then there 's public perception : i 'm pretty sure most dutch people for example would not see the part of turkey situated to the right of the egeian sea as european , but rather as asian or some other category . 
  in the end the borders of europe are arbitrary , so there are no wrong answers in my opinion . 
  even the borders set by geologists are arbitrary in the end , and disconnected from the cultural or political reality of said nations . 
  edit : thanks for the downvote !, 
  very open minded of you  . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  if a son of mine would commit such a crime i would consider it * in his best interest * to turn him in . 
  what else can you expect as a parent if your young adult son displays such behavior at age 17 ? 
  withholding justice from him will not unlikely lead to reinforcement of such behavior . 
  moreover , turning him in could be considered to be an act of love - instead of something like disowning your child . 
  it 's in his best interest that this type of behavior gets punished and moreover , will be prevented in the future by a range of measures . 
  likely : there 's also personal honour at play here ( and a connected cultural phenomenon ) and so i expect the ambassador will just send his sons back as ` punishment ' and act like nothing happened . 
  after all , it was only a ` local ' boy that got badly hurt in this vicious attack . 
  that 's the likely scenario , but i 'm hoping he 'll give a good example and make sure they get prosecuted in portugal . 
  though i will remark i have come across plenty of bad children with loving , good parents . 
  some things can easily be out of your control as parents , but this event does testify of a lack of morals . 
  whether that 's the parent ( s ) fault here is anyone 's best guess , but at this point the guys that did this just need to be dealt with according to the provisions of the law . 
  that 's the most important thing here in my opinion . 
   in the briefest of updates , lusa has revealed that the twin boys `` have diplomatic immunity '' . 
  they may have been in police custody yesterday , but it seems certain that they will have been subsequently released . 
  a terrible thing . 
  iraq should do the right thing and revoke their immunity , or at the very least , try them at home if it is not willing to do so . 
  i hope the ambassador pressures his own government to allow his sons to be prosecuted in portugal . 
  any good parent would after all not forgive such a crime . 
   give the finger to vienna convention or declare war on iraq ... what ? 
  my god , how shortsighted can you be boy ? 
  this is ** one ** case , and that does not justify ` giving the finger to the vienna convention ' or to ` declare war on iraq ' . 
  i hope you realize that is neither proportionate nor logical to start out with . 
  some background info on the vienna convention : it serves to protect diplomats from criminal prosecution , so that the people involved can do their work in an undisturbed manner . 
  the drafters of the vienna convention wanted to prevent controversy and thus decided about full criminal immunity for the diplomat as well as a kind of * derived * immunity for his/her direct family . 
  relevant example : portuguese diplomat / u/masquechatice is sent to the netherlands . 
  the netherlands does n't like portugal that much , but wants to keep its threats covert . 
  therefore it decides to make up fake charges of murder and to prosecute / u/masquechatice on those charges , to send a ` warning ' to portugal . 
  needless to say , no one can help you in that case and it would give the host state a huge position of power over foreign missions in general . 
  it would obstruct diplomatic traffic . 
  the unwanted side effect is this though . 
  but it 's still preferable to dumping the vienna convention altogether . 
  let me guess , the fifth column here is a similarly minded group of people that always exactly thinks the same and adheres to the basic principles of terrorism ? 
  i have a feeling your ideas about a fifth column here are rather broad . 
  also , i will not accompany each comment here with a thousand disclaimers . 
  to state the obvious : those that are a threat to the rest of society need to be dealt with accordingly . 
  it 's as if the people pushing for it ** want ** you to be afraid . 
  if you keep feeding people news like this on a daily basis some of them will change in cowardly , easily scared persons . 
  this in turn can be exploited for political gain again , given the strong impact after an attack . 
  really , this is so low effort . 
  at least adress what i said in a proper sense , instead of trying to cheaply score like this ( including downvoting , thank you for that ! ) . 
  no it is n't good , yet it is really curious to see how so many young people in the west turn out to be cowards that are extremely easily intimated by something that happened far away . 
  in your case , thousands of kilometers away given your polish flair . 
  do you understand that it is far from rational , and even emotionally unstable , to worry about something like this ? 
  i said that isis thrives on fear , which is just a fact . 
  as long as you and others show that you 're easily intimated by such savages , you 've handed them a victory . 
  and as said above again : ** measures ** will be taken by the government involved , in this case the swiss government . 
  there 's no point in overly worrying about it to the point that it becomes obsessive . 
  rather think of the victims here . 
   so yup i am concerned . 
  frankly , it is little to no concern if you consider all the details . 
  the chance that you , me or any other person reading this comment here on / r/europe gets caught up in a terror attack is extremely slim at best . 
  you better worry about putting on your safety belt in the car instead of this kind of stuff . 
  the chance you 'll die in a car accident is many magnitudes higher after all . 
  a normal strong guy of your age should n't be worried or concerned by some story like this in the media . 
  if so you 're either easily scared or overestimating the possible threat from isis . 
  remember that isis thrives on fear and people gossiping like old women about what could happen next - and what we should prepare for !, 
  really , let it go . 
  this attack was terrible , but there 's no noteworthy risk to anyone in switzerland or elsewhere in europe in that sense . 
  measures will be taken as per usual - and life will go on . 
  ** edit : ** thank you for the downvotes . 
  it shows that you are interested in other opinions only if it suits yourself , right boys  . 
  and where a news article is reduced to being a catchy title . 
  reddit should consider embedding linked articles directly in the post , so that more people are inclined to read it .
