  oh , and a system that helps in clarifying which sources are reliable and which are n't ( on a scale ranging from ` excellent ' to ` thrash ' ( e.g. 
  daily mail ) together with corresponding color codes might be positive as well . 
   weather or not you agree the actions of the west always seem less evil to westerners and i hate to say it but most people have a real bias toward overlooking the evil shit we do and continue to do either overtly or covertly , i understand the point you 're making , but it is n't * necessarily * bias . 
  bias would imply that one would approve of borderline actions by western nations faster because those nations are closer to ones own . 
  in my view the way we organized our societies and the values we hold dear actually just make * sense * ( a whole lot of sense ) and if we extend that to other , foreign nations that is fine . 
  there are interests to defend and each and every country in the world engages in it . 
  just to be clear : i could not accept any european nation annexing a stretch of land by hostile action . 
  it amounts to going back in time , to the pre-1945 situation where annexation was still a rather normal and accepted method of gaining more territory . 
  but actively defending your interests and even your nation 's own safety ( ! ), 
  should be given the benefit of the doubt whenever the means you employ to do so are not too extreme . 
  there will always be conflicts between nations about what was the ` right ' course of action and that will always imply some degree of partiality . 
  well your example testifies to a gross violation of international law , including the un charter itself . 
  if western states backed a coup - something which we do n't know - it would still be more innocent in my eyes than simply annexating a large stretch of land ( as russia did in crimea ) . 
  it might even be the lesser evil here , given the course turkey has taken in the past few years even despite the fact it would amount to a violation of international law as well . 
  both situations are n't comparable though , not morally and not legally . 
  especially the us statement was extremely ambigious . 
  it was something along the lines of ` we 'll see with whom we do business tomorrow '' . 
  it also started out with a lower government official , whose words were more or less overruled by obama or kerry as soon as it became evident the coup had failed . 
  ca n't blame them though : it 's in the interest of western nations that erdogan steps off the main stage . 
   i disagree , in fact , this is why i feel the eu has failed recently , it has never become more than a club of nations and the more it grew the more unwieldy it became . 
  the amazing part here is that whenever there 's talk about fixing the problem - in practice meaning the transfer of additional powers to brussels - many populist leaning people jump into some crampy nationalist reflex . 
  as it stands , the eu is an impossible compromise between the nation state and a ( con ) federation . 
  it is a walking example of a bad compromise where there are efforts going on to appease multiple sides , while the result is not that satisfying to any party involved . 
  the fun part is that the ` inability ' to act by the eu is fed by the inactivity of the same kind of people that like to complain about it : they are not willing to agree to further transfer of powers and this in turn feeds their own interests , as the eu can not effectively take on problem x. 
  it 's a deeply dishonest point of view in the end . 
  never bring in the word ' truth ' in topics like these . 
  truth is at best a subjective thing in such cases . 
  not to mention the criticism above just does n't make sense . 
  there 's a huge cultural rift between turkey and europe that keeps widening with each passing day - and many europeans are seeing turkey slide away from a way of life they consider their own , or similar to their own . 
  hence the turmoil : many people here would 've wanted the coup to succeed . 
  that 's no secret . 
  and quite frankly : after seeing the aftermath of the failed coup d'\u00e9tat attempt they were n't wrong either . 
  this event has become erdogan his reichtag 's fire , just as predicted by a few people here when the coup itself was still underway . 
  we or you ? 
  i 'm not a fan of the guy , he 's not to be found in ` my ' political corner - but i got little reason to disgust him . 
  be very careful with calling out ' ** we ** ' by the way . 
  to safely park ` money ' instead of being forced to park it somewhere more risky . 
  that 's the most important thing to know in my opinion . 
  we use other methods nowadays . 
  we try to argue people into death , to the point that they 'll just concede life itself . 
   `` but it can not survive ** treason ** from within . '', 
  it 's still curious to see how the word ` treason ' is completely pulled out of all legal context and applied to people one does not agree with that much more often than in the past nowadays . 
  shortly put : speaking of treason outside of a legal context is a highly dangerous thing to do , as the word treason is not properly defined outside of that context . 
  in practice it 's mostly being used by a certain subgroup of people to condemn or even harass those they do n't agree with , so you might better avoid such characterisation . 
  i think those that disagree with merkel her policy - myself included - would do well to remember that . 
  up with this : there 's too much hive mind going on with regard to merkel her past remarks regarding the refugee crisis . 
  i 'm no fan of her policy still , but we should n't pull what she said out of context for mere political gain . 
  have you ever met a religious person ? 
  you seem to have a massive confirmation bias towards those that believe , specifically that they 're all ` negative ' people . 
  it 's the same affliction / r/atheism suffers from : the comments there do n't remain limited to whatever arch-conservative christian leader x said in country y : it 's a general distaste for everything that 's religious and everyone associated with it . 
  i hate those people : more than once i 've been confronted with the / r/atheism stereotype whenever i remarked on being atheist myself and it 's highly annoying . 
  you contribute to that by saying ` lol , when will people learn that religion is unethical and causes nothing but problems ... ' . 
  if i had to choose i 'd pick this murdered priest over you any time . 
  the vatican already called the act ` barbaric ' - and i reckon pope francis personally approved of that message . 
  i hope the pope will find some way to further improve the stature of priest hamel post-mortum , e.g. 
  declaring him venerable , so that his legacy will continue to exist . 
  same . 
  glancing over / r/atheism always make me sad for example . 
  you can be atheist and ** not ** feel the need to belittle those that believe on a daily basis . 
  these people have no idea how much damage they cause to other atheists . 
  more importantly , article 50 remains silent about the option of * cancelling * a withdrawal notification . 
  i wonder what that means in case the uk changes its mind after triggering it , as that is a real option here . 
  maybe it 's a minor thing , but there seems no explicit mechanism to reverse the notification . 
  even though i disliked the outcome of the coup , it would indeed be weird to think other major nations in the world had zero knowledge of the coup plans . 
  i think other countries , especially the us , had intel a coup was about to take place but refused to share it to an ally - that being turkey . 
  moreover , i would n't be surprised if other countries covertly supported the coup in turkey . 
  it 's in their best interest erdogan disappears after all , thus financing and controlling a coup attempt in the shadows does make sense . 
  then there 's the sudden disappearance of davotoglu off the main stage of turkish politics . 
  that 's also odd in some way , yet not necessarily connected . 
  looks like the perfect bond criminal in my eyes . 
  precisely !, 
  personally i often asked myself the question how much one must hate oneself in order to decide to kill yourself and others in a suicide attack . 
  someone that loves life and all it stands for would never be inclined to pull off such an extreme move in my view . 
  sanctions which are being repealed as we speak . 
  google ` turkey russia ties ' and set the timescale to 7 days or so . 
  you 'll notice that erdogan is rapidly moving towards moscow 's warm embrace , and away from the rest of the west . 
  it all points out to him expecting western involvement in the botched putch . 
  i understand where he 's coming from , as ` evil ' in itself tends to be used as an absolute term instead of a descriptive term . 
  it 's part of a continuum ( evil to good ) , where either side in practice can not be fully achieved . 
  although i have to admit , isis guys for example are the closest any people have gotten to ` full evil ' in my eyes . 
   it is certainly true that `` lone wolves '' ( i.e. 
  those acting without direct planning by or support from a wider network such as isis ) often have mental health issues . 
  research cited by interpol suggests that perpetrators in more than a third of `` lone-actor attacks '' carried out in europe between 2000 and 2015 suffered some sort of psychiatric disorder . 
  yet all too often there is little detail about the exact nature of those illnesses , if indeed they exist at all beyond anecdotal remarks made by friends and family . 
  the effect is that we gloss over the specifics in favour of creating a kind of homogenised bogeyman figure -- a religious fundamentalist afflicted by mental illness : immune to rationality , a threat to know . 
   this is dangerous because we run the risk of conflating religious devotion with mental illness ( atheist jokes aside ) and of simplifying and demonising both . 
  worse , by alighting on a stereotype that will rarely live up to reality we miss the complexities that lie behind both the fomenting and manifestation of lone wolf violence . 
  and that really is bonkers . 
  not much more to add to this . 
  the ' ( nearly ) all jihadists are mentally ill ' narrative - at least in an implicit sense - has gained quite a lot of ground and drastically simplifies some of the causes behind extremism . 
  we should n't act so simple towards it . 
  exactly : you neatly summarized what is going on here . 
  he does n't care about visa free travel : he wants to ` score ' for his followers . 
  the situation is getting more worrying by the day , and erdogan can certainly be said to be drunk at this point - drunk off power . 
  the tightening of ties between russia and turkey is probably the most concerning development of them all . 
  in this case , it is n't . 
  i urged people for caution during the munich attack as there were strong signs of a breivik inspired terror attack , but in this case there 's little reason to doubt . 
  target : a priest method : slithing of the throat , ~ ~ together with beheading . ~ ~ ** edit : ** the latter has not been uniformly confirmed by the media . 
  these two makes me think it 's almost sure in what ` corner ' we should be looking with regards to the perpetrators , so people are indeed free to speculate radical muslims did this . 
  nobody can be sure yet though , but that does n't matter in this case .
