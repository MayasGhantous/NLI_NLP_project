  why should n't johnson and farage see this through until the bitter end ? 
  because the latter also includes taking the heat for false promises as well as failing to deliver on those very promises . 
  may i ask why you think about leaving ? 
  i can think of a few reasons , though you did spark my curiosity here . 
  you 'd do wise to fear the netherlands for the future . 
  my country blocked talks multiple times and will be the last obstacle for accession to the eu , at least so i predict . 
  there 's just a few options at most : completely leaving the eu , entering the eea , brokering a separate deal or just remaining altogether . 
  at this point , all seem equally likely due to a lack of plans from the british side - especially taking the signs from brussels into account . 
  spoken like a true belgian patriot . 
  there 's still a chance it wo n't : a significant one even . 
  in the end parliament calls the shots here , and not the ill-informed british brexit-voter . 
  i 'd say there 's a 20-30 % chance the uk will remain in the eu after all . 
  so much this . 
  it 's this observation that makes me think world war iii will happen during our lifetime , taking all current factors into account . 
  it 's a scary thing to realize overall . 
  excellent . 
  now i see where you 're actually coming from , but still : would it be wise to vote such a man into the most powerful office on this planet ? 
  it seems rash , unnecessary dangerous and a bit masochistic even . 
  but let 's be honest here : you 're right that low turnout during elections ( a symptome of people taking elections not serious enough ) is a threat to the longterm existence of democracy , and we 're seeing the same trend across the entire western world - especially among younger voters . 
  it 's just to much of a gamble though : safer to vote a more able populistic politican into office than donald trump . 
  a quick control-f on the search ` farage ' turns out you just selected the worst comment in this entire thread as your second example . 
  out of the 50 search results , about 47 or so we 're very much defendable , thus i fail to see your point . 
  i see no problems with examples 3 through 5 : there 's some true cowardice at play here . 
  the people were convinced to make a truly idiotic choice and deceit was not shunned in order to make that happen . 
  it 's in that sense not borderline to say that he ` fucked the country over ' or ` that he does n't want to be captain of the sinking ship that is the uk right now ' or that he 's a ` fucking coward ' . 
  also , there are plenty of arguments here as well in favor of farage ( quite a large minority , i think about 20 % -25 % of comments so far ) are positive towards farage his move . 
  by far most comments are valid criticism though . 
  well you create some kind of charicature , a totem of you will , of / r/europe and everyone that comments here - in order to be able to attack it more easily . 
  you willfully misrepresent the views of people that detest farage for some very good reasons , and that pretty much falls into the definition of strawman . 
  whether you agree to it or not or even still believe you 're right in summarizing criticism of farage in that manner , a question still remains . 
  why lower yourself to that level ? 
   but sorry - i forgot this is / r/europe - let me try again : `` hahahaha farage is spineless , britain is fucked !!!! '', 
  excellent strawman . 
  extra bonus points for you !, 
  the comment above then ( the one i responded to ) is a good example of poe 's law . 
  it 's so onesided and extreme that one would think it 's a parody of such a position , but actually it 's real . 
  damn . 
  i do n't think that 's * that * sure of a result , as a proper explanation would sway at least part of the brexit voters . 
  your concern is still very valid though : it would create a breach of trust between voters and those they elect to represent them . 
  i just do n't think it 's fatal by default . 
  the thing is , there 's still quite some time until the next general elections and being transparant about the whole thing might result in less fallout in the next elections . 
  as usual : the tories hold the key . 
  they need to forever shed this image of a torn party held hostage by eurosceptics : if they can pull that off , protest votes can go nowhere but to ukip . 
  it can still be undone , but in that case government * and * parliament need to be very specific why it would n't be in britains benefit to leave ( a ) and why the people their opinion should therefore ( b ) be overruled . 
  any message of that kind should be broadcast as a national message , together with debunking some of the most important brexit myths as well as further on giving some cold hard facts about british benefits of staying in the eu . 
  you forgot the / s. 
  i mean : it was meant sarcastically , right ? 
  right ? 
  refreshing , is n't it ? 
  the uk is glad to take some heat off the us after trump his advertising , although donald will undoubtedly be back with more to be ashamed off  . 
  edit : fixed some things . 
  who knows , maybe nigel went short before brexit !, 
  would 've brought in a decent profit for farage . 
  that was the first thing that came to mind again : they got what they wanted , and it 's up to the less known yet more * capable * people to clean up the mess . 
  i sincerely hope that cleaning up the mess means that after inventorying all the options , a bremain is one of the options still . 
  really : farage and johnson were ** the ** most important faces of the brexit campaign and in that role they were guilty to spreading a great many lies about the eu and the uk it 's future outside the eu . 
  in a better world they would 've been held criminally accountable , together with the sun and comparable papers that violated the most elementary principles of journalism . 
   as a dane with american citizenship this is so sole reason why im seriously considering voting for trump to the election in november ~ ~ sorry but please get out of this faux victim role please : if you are no fan of reasoning , you should n't be getting anywhere close to a ballot box . ~ ~ ( edit : that was put too adverserial ) shortly stated : if there 's a myriad of arguments against donald trump , and these arguments are ` heavier weighing ' than those against hillary clinton , it makes no sense to vote trump out of a mere ` feeling ' . 
  feelings should n't really matter when you go out to vote : you need to look at what said person stands for , consult your own knowledge and ethical convictions , and vote on that basis . 
  taking the previous into account , it 's nearly impossible for donald trump to come out on top . 
  a few things out of the article linked above :  under the new law , most of the 711 judges at two of the highest courts - the council of state , which hears cases lodged by citizens against the government , and the supreme court of appeals - will be removed . 
  it is not clear how many of them will be reappointed . 
  also :  there will be fewer judges and new appointments will be carried out by the high council of judges and prosecutors ( hsyk ) , which oversees judicial appointments and falls * under the control * of the justice ministry . 
  and :  erdogan will also be able to appoint a quarter of the judges at the council of state , allowing him to stack one of the country 's most important legal bodies with his allies . 
  not agreeing with him does n't mean he 's biased . 
  moreover , in the first few minutes he killed many misconceptions or even straight out lies brought forward by the leave camp out of his own expertise . 
  when smart people of the likes of him speak about european law and politics you just need to sit down and listen . 
  he is far more capable to make the right assessments in situations as these due to his expertise , while you likely compared to him can not . 
  respect the verdict of the experts , instead of thinking you know better . 
  excellent post : especially the professor his remarks about the ` dirtyness ' and deceit of the leave campaign again confirm what i 've been saying for months already . 
  again : leave should be deeply ashamed of the campaign they fought . 
  truth was arguably the first victim of it . 
  i 've read the entire piece . 
  it 's a ** bit ** of a doomsday message if you ask me . 
  the western world is bombarded to a house of cards that could fall apart any day now , while that just can not happen anytime soon . 
  whether its nato or the internal market of the eu : there are too many shared interests at stake here to see it all crumbling . 
  i also found it odd the author saw jeremy corbyn as the only viable alternative in the uk . 
  it might betray something about the author itself . 
  what a circus , though re-elections might be the best method to prevent this thing floating around for years to come . 
  brexit happened in the meanwhile though . 
  could this boost the fp\u00d6 vote ? 
  switzerland always gets brought up as the ultimate example of how good referendums can work , yet you ought to realize that switzerland was also the country that - in a referendum - voted for the ban of certain mosque towers ( even though they 're ugly and polluting to the landscape , but that aside ) . 
  the people can also be mobilized to vote for nonsense , or things they can not understand , no matter how good referendums can be . 
  it 's this downside that gets me on my nerves , especially when the subject at hand is very complex . 
  or what about the media ? 
  a lot of power gets shifted towards the media in the weeks and months leading up to a plebescite , with the smear campaign in the uk being a prime example of it . 
  both sides fought an extremely ugly battle where truth was arguably the first victim of it all . 
  there is not * that much * to proud of , taking the previous into account . 
  but alright , we will continue to fundamentally differ on this subject . 
  i just want to remark that i do not look down on the average joe or something : i just do n't want him to cut himself by making a stupid move . 
  in the end , the prosperity of everyone in country x should not be decided by a mere flip of a coin . 
  let 's hope that day indeed never arrives  . 
  as i said years ago already : citizens in majority could n't hope to give a good answer to such complicated questions . 
  in that sense the brexit referendum was a major mistake , notwithstanding the outcome of the entire thing . 
  in my view democracy does not need to be further ` completed ' by adding the instrument of referendum , unless the question asked would be extremely obvious and within the realm of knowledge of the average citizen . 
  bear in mind that mob rule is not that far apart from what we call democracy and the instrument of referendum is one of the many methods towards that path . 
  but i could still be wrong of course : the coming years will give more answers whether about what passed was right or wrong . 
  ` much appreciated ' . 
  i 'm doubting about what to be grateful for , but i 'll give you the benefit of the doubt in this case !, 
  the eu was by the way already reinventing itself for quite some years already , and this is just another stimulus to do so .
