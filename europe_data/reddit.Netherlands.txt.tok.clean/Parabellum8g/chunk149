  they had in their hands and gave it away out of lazyness . 
  also , was n't this a concern months prior to the referendum already ? 
  seems like bringing up the topic was ineffective after all . 
  ** edit : ** downvote all you want stranger . 
  it does n't take away the fact that young people stayed ** away in large numbers ** in this ** crucial ** moment for the uk . 
  they blew it in the end no matter how the old would 've voted . 
  that 's just a sheer fact , no matter how you turn it around . 
  not necessary . 
  all people that engage in spoiling great series need to be drawn and quartered as a mandatory sentence . 
  yes , that 's my evil yet righteous side speaking . 
  the remaining eight are 7/8 eu ( including wales ) . 
  the top 16 was 14/16 eu . 
  not that it should matter that much , yet i fail to understand where you get your numbers from . 
  might want to tag that one as a massive got s06e10 spoiler . 
  indeed , we should 've known better after last week 's string of setbacks and unsound decisions . 
  the bookmakers were wrong though , again . 
  true : yet historically the bookmakers are still very often right . 
  you can get a good idea about what direction the election will be taking by just looking at the odds . 
  does n't mean it will happen , just that the odds of it happening are large . 
  according to the bookmakers , he got the best odds . 
  who demands scotland should leave tomorrow ? 
  it could leave next year , or if need be in 2018 . 
  the thing is that the scottish economy will take a terrible hit on its own due to the reemergence of trade obstacles . 
  in that case it could better play safe and just leave the uk altogether , instead of waiting for a deal that wo n't be worthwhile in the end anyways . 
  after all : the eu can not afford to give the uk the better end of the deal or it would encourage other nations to do the same . 
  if i were an e.g. 
  whiskey producer in scotland , i 'd be bankrolling a leave campaign for scotland at this point . 
  there 's just too much risk involved . 
  guess it 's fair the netherlands got equated to a stroopwafel . 
  better to have us depicted as a stroopwafel compared to e.g. 
  a wheel of gouda cheese . 
  it 's not really about punishment - though i understand that you read it as such . 
  what i meant is that the uk should not get the * better end * of the deal , as that will incite more countries to leave the eu in the future - possibly my own . 
  nice and open how you say the uk can count on the rest of the anglosphere , but the uk economically deals mostly with the eu . 
  that 's something that can not change overnight , so the uk will still be dependant on europe ( and therefore , the eu ) during that time . 
  a deal will have to be made , taking * everyone 's * best interests into consideration . 
  that includes the interests of the european project - which will make it rather ` difficult ' for the uk to come out on top . 
  thanks for this : you made me laugh out loud here  . 
   the people is always right , on its rulers perhaps , but not on policy they in majority could n't hope to understand . 
  you also can not maintain that position as being logical : it 's an ideological one out of principle , not one necessarily in line with reality . 
  or are you proposing that all people that voted on brexit yesterday were professors in european law ? 
  of course they were n't !, 
   you 're not in favor of a democracy either . 
  i am , yet there 's a very strong urge among the pro referendum crowd on the internet to translate ` democracy ' to ` direct democracy ' and making direct democracy the ** only interpretation ** of democracy . 
  that 's what bothers me so much about this , as representative democracy is democracy as well . 
  i just do n't want to see people decide about the most complex of policies which they could not hope to understand , as that will bring us on a path to misery and misfortunes . 
  that 's why i consider letting ` the mob ' rule - as is the case with direct democracy - a bad idea . 
  people are swayed too easily for us to safely experiment with such ideas . 
   but they also voted to remain in the uk , under different circumstances . 
  i can remember warnings about a second referendum directly after the pro-independence crowd lost ( i thought sturgeon uttered those warnings !, 
  ) , with clear references to the upcoming eu referendum . 
  it 's only reasonable that now the tables have turned so much to give scotland a new referendum : situations after all are n't comparable anymore . 
   and it 's the uk as a whole that voted out . 
  i also wonder why you make this distinction . 
  the first part deals with scotland being fully able to make decisions as such on its own , yet here scotland is suddenly ` incompetent ' to do so as the ` uk as a whole ' has decided for them already . 
  despite the local outcome , which is unequivocally ` remain ' . 
  with a damn large margin even !, 
  as you notice , we do quite differ about what is right and honest here . 
  saying that the scottish should not have a second referendum because ` they already decided on that ' is deeply dishonest in my view . 
  i do n't like this response one bit , especially how you top it off with cgpgrey his video about thought germs . 
  it suggests ` copying ' other positions , even though i am convinced the vast majority of people here do not need inspired by others to be disappointed . 
  i also do not share your opinion that the motivating factors of the brexit camp were ` xenophobia and racism ' : that 's a narrative i do not see here today , not widespread at least . 
  it is true : fear of immigration * was used * to sway some of the last people that were still doubting , while the hard legal and economical aspects of leaving were n't discussed enough . 
  the entire debate in the uk devolved into demagogy of the likes i 've never seen before in my life , and that certainly is a bad precedent . 
  i 'd also like to remind you about the split between the higher educated and lower educated in terms of voting behavior : the higher educated voted in favor of a remain , while the lower educated voted in favour of a leave . 
  that some subreddit where mostly the higher educated comment draws the same conclusions is indeed a demographical misrepresentation of the rest of europe maybe , but not unreasonable altogether . 
  many people here are concerned about the financial , economical and political fallout of what happened , and have plenty of reason to be angered . 
  pretty opportunistic , although i would n't be surprised if that 's the main motivator here . 
  the thing is , you 're not that much in favor of democracy as well . 
  you want ochlocracy , mob rule , and not a system that will ensure the best decisions will be taken . 
  and even in the latter democracy is terrible , but to get all high horsed and say ` the people have spoken ' comes down to ` the people are always right ' . 
  you should get that idea out of your head : the people are often ** wrong ** . 
  due to a lack of education ( as we saw , most higher educated people voted remain , while lowly educated that did n't understand the subject matter voted leave ) , due to being manipulated by the media or because of simple internal emotional strife : they are just human beings at the end of the day . 
  the sum of all those parts does n't make the verdict cast by those people perfect to say the least . 
  there 's a very vocal ` pro-referendum ' croud all over the internet that completely do not consider the risks involved , including the dangers related to increasing the power of the media . 
  there is nothing to celebrate today . 
  do you expect brussels - or individual eu member states - to give the uk a ` good deal ' after all this ? 
  i can assure you that whatever britain manages to drag in after an exit will not be enough for scotland : the english and welsh have completely poisoned the mood at the negotiating table after all . 
  brussels also got its own interests here : if leaving gets ` interesting ' then other countries will follow . 
  any deal the uk will get afterwards will be mediocre in that regard . 
  the best possibilities for scotland will therefore be in the eu . 
  as we 're apparantly letting the people decide about horrendously complex topics like eu membership we might as well listen to the scottish people as well , that clearly voted to stay ** in ** the eu . 
  ** edit : ** no idea why you people downvote the person above . 
  he asked a valid question . 
  whether that question is popular or not is irrelevant . 
  who knows !, 
  we might as well reinstate a trial by combat while we 're at it as well . 
  this country will not leave : it was one of the founders of the eu and our media fortunately are n't the same as in the uk . 
  any referendum on the eu will highly likely fail here , despite the recent outcome of the ukraine association treaty referendum . 
  full support for the scottish government : shortsightedness should not prevail and draw other countries within the uk with it into an economical , diplomatical and financial abyss . 
  scotland should leave the uk : there 's too much at stake for the scottish people . 
  that 's hardly surprising : people that go to a subreddit dedicated to europe are likely to be more open minded and in general interested in european affairs . 
  a nationalist brit would not as easily cross the border between / r/uk ( politics ) and / r/europe . 
   this is just reality . 
  there is no such thing as allies . 
  machiavellian , but alright . 
  it however does n't take away the impression as if the english and welsh just spit in the face of the rest of europe - and that attitude will not work forever . 
  but lets end this : the long waiting game has begun and at this point we can go back to observing . 
  the uk has changed history , yet at this point i 'm convinced the long term change will be negative for the uk and possibly negative for all other countries involved . 
   regarding your paragraph about shortcomings of democracy - well , that 's the thing about a universal democracy where everyone gets a vote , is n't it ?
