  the massive retaliatory onslaught that followed has no place in our present day world society , nor the type of puppet regime ( nowadays lead by ramzan kadyrov ) that was installed afterwards . 
   ok , give me a valid interpretation of why us bombings are not act of aggression . 
  to this , i refer back to article 8bis section 1 , which claims that there must be a violation of the chapter of united nations . 
  given the founding goals of the united nations , i can see no violation of the chapter when action is being taken against savages that want to install a totalitarian , theocratic and terrorist state that is openly hostile towards everyone that thinks otherwise . 
  that includes russia , and that includes you . 
  to secure peace in the region and peace in the west , intervention is allowed in my view . 
   but it was n't allowed . 
  a difference in legal stance it is then . 
  however , if international law would be so solid as you present it to be , then there would be no single conflict in the world . 
  instead : international law is weak because of its customary , non codified nature . 
   warning it 's not coordination . 
  in fact if you read your own provided article it states : `` we did not coordinate our actions with the syrian government . '', 
  indeed , and what did i say in the next paragraph : `` but more importantly : aggression is defined by legal means , and as it stands now the airstrikes on syria do not fall in the definition of aggression put forward by the icc . '', 
  what syria thinks about it , what the us thinks about , or what russia thinks about it in that regard is not important . 
  no crime is committed until it falls within the definition of aggression . 
   the attacks were condemned by syria , also russian and iran . 
  the link you give here is in advance of the attacks , and therefore not important . 
  after the attacks took place , there was no clear condemnation . 
   again changing subject . 
  not at all . 
  the entire mh17 disaster which is part of the ukraine civil war fits completely in russia 's foreign policy , which is aggressive to say the least . 
  that is why i consider this entire discussion to be highly ironic , given how russia is behaving in the world . 
  before i called you a possible putinbot , now i believe that you might as well be a nationalist that has been led astray . 
   it has nothing to do with morality . 
  the law is the law . 
  then i believe the neurenburg trials should never have happened . 
  the same goes for the soviet trials orchestrated in poland for example to convict ex-nazi 's . 
  if you really adhere to ` the law is the law ' , and completely separate morality from legality , then such trials may not have taken place at all . 
  but what you said is in itself barely defendable : ` the law is the law ' * implies * that international law is some hard piece of iron that can not be forged into the right shape . 
  international law , especially regarding warfare and self-defense especially , is extremely open to interpretation . 
  this is the failure of the atlantic charter , that is due to be updated after 70 years . 
   i do n't do that , simply i do n't want to change the subject from one where i can crush your arguments easily to another which is more difficult and would take time i do n't want to dedicate to that . 
  i bring up grozny because you talk about aggression . 
  you can not talk about aggression - at least not morally - if your own government adheres to double standards . 
  but apparantly this falls on deaf ears and it ` can not be said ' . 
  what this has to do with topic discussed ? 
  since you are obviously , and ferociously , defending russian interests i might as well go ahead and destroy any possible dreams that you might have in this regard . 
  i do n't say you have by default , but given your position it would n't surprise me if you are a proponent of reinstating the old sphere of influence over europe . 
  edit : to just get rid of this non-discussion ; the entire argument revolves around international law and how ` solid ' it really is . 
  apparantly you have this constitutional view of international law , which is fine . 
  however , international law is far from rigid and subject of constant change , whether you want it or not . 
  i can refer you to dixon his book regarding international law in that matter : maybe you find it refreshing . 
  bombing another country - if allowed - is no act of aggression indeed . 
  and moreover : the bombing is n't directed on the syrian government its infrastructure , but moreover towards its ** enemies ** . 
  you keep turning around this sheer fact , as it completely destroys whatever you try to make clear . 
   first of all , objection is not needed . 
  the criteria is permission . 
  if you are going to go a sovereign state and kill citizens of this state - this is an act of agression unless you were called to do it . 
  or another option would be a sanction by un security council . 
  in general that is the case , as i said above , but international law is always moving . 
  unless you expect russia to let go of its veto in this case ? 
  oh , that 's right , russia wo n't do that because of its strong relationships with the assad regime , including weapon shipments . 
  the unsc is a dead end and you know it . 
  the unsc is powerless by default when the personal interests of states are concerned , so this is no option at all . 
  what you are talking about is a matter of procedure , and knowing russia , matters of procedure are of no interest * unless it can be used as an excuse * . 
   second , they objected and stated that without their concent - they will interpret those bombings as act of agression . 
  to which obama replied with treats of direct intervention against assad . 
  woops , did they ? 
  or what did the foreign minister say again ? 
  `` the syrian government * welcomes the international consensus on fighting terrorism * but has stressed that * any uncoordinated action * inside syria without the consent of the syrian government would be deemed as an aggression . '', 
  any uncoordinated action . 
  and what did the us do in [ response ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/syria-informed-in-advance-of-us-led-airstrikes-against-islamic-state/2014/09/23/848d79ae-4315-11e4-b437-1a7368204804_story.html ) ? 
  syria was warned about imminent airstrikes on its own territory . 
  but more importantly : aggression is defined by legal means , and as it stands now the airstrikes on syria do not fall in the definition of aggression put forward by the icc . 
  once again , and you keep turning around this simple fact , syria did not respond in * any way whatsoever * . 
  simply because this is in syria 's advantage and by not objecting in an ever changing world of international law , syria has implicitly allowed for the bombings to take place . 
  of course i would have liked it if syria would 've expressly authorized the us and its allies , but that is impossible as the syrian government would lose face and because russia would not allow it as well . 
  the unsc is without any real power , as we 've seen once again over the past years , especially during the mh17 disaster again . 
  something i will never forget , and i know damn well who 's responsible for what happened over the skies of ukraine . 
  so forgive me if i do n't take russian bait for granted . 
  i purposely named the examples of grozny and georgia because you seem to take the moral highground , while russia has long forfeited ** any rights ** regarding morality . 
  the three conflicts i named are there to demonstrate that russia is mainly interested in its own assets , and will do everything to bend public opinion into its own direction . 
  you probably can not see how this will destroy russia in the long run , but this type of isolation will make russia lose even more friends while the west steadily gains even more . 
  russia will be decimated once again , and this time it wo n't be because of the fall of communism but because of the failure of its own leadership . 
  but to simply discard grozny as ` not important ' , even while the same un that you seem to recognize as important claimed in 2003 that grozny was the most destroyed urban area in the world , gives away your position . 
  we are done talking . 
  do n't you ever think that russia can step into europe though : russian influence is a thing of the past and it wo n't come back . 
  we have all seen the wonders of russian international politics in the post wwii world . 
  no it is not , and at this point i am strongly suspecting you to be some kind of putinbot . 
  it is true that formal permission is being considered a requirement under customary law , but customary law is malleable and keeps developing itself . 
  no one really knows the boundaries of intervention , and that includes russia , but really now what point are you making here ? 
  because we know that : - the us and other allies ( including nato partners ) are bombing in iraq and syria . 
  - a limited number is bombing in syria , including the us . 
  - syria has not objected against it and shows no willingsness to stop intervention on their own soil . 
  - the syrian government is not in complete control of its territory , let alone over its people . 
  and now you come waltsing in and say : ` this is an act of aggression ' . 
  why ? 
  because you really , desperately , want to frame the us and its partners as ` aggressors ' , which completely fits in the kremlin its propaganda . 
  you just ignore the most important fact , and that is that syria in practice just gave permission for this . 
  even if syria would n't have given permission , the r2p doctrine could 've been used to intervene anyways . 
  but talking about aggression : let me just forget about grozny , [ which was burned to the ground by the russian army ] ( http://www.panos.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ler00080rus.jpg ) , let me forget about russia 's involvement in georgia and how it like a bully took on a nation that was much smaller than russia in a manner that completely borders cowardice and above all : let me forget the obvious destabilization of ukraine that is being perpetrated by russia at this very moment . 
  do n't lecture me on aggression while russia itself is the king in maintaining double standards , even more than the united states of america . 
  only that assad has stated that he does not care and basically gives permission for doing so . 
  the reason why he does not call it permission is that he would appear weak in that situation . 
  but he basically gave the go ahead some time ago already , as it benefits him . 
  also , iraq gave permission , which makes bombing specific parts of iraq and syria very much allowed . 
  the absence of russia in maintaining world order is striking again though . 
  although i did n't expect anything else . 
  if you also can not see the difference between the free media here , and the sock puppets used by the kremlin , then you are really too indoctrinated already . 
  robbed of your sense of critical thinking by years of obedience to the state and the creation of an enemy image .
