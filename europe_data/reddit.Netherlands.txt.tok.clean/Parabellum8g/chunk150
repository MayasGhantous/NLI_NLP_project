  it does n't matter how educated or uneducated ; how smart or stupid ; how altruistic or selfish ; how emotional or clear-thinking ; how young or old ; how rich or poor you are . 
  it does n't matter whether you 're a man or a woman ; employed or unemployed ; whether you care or not . 
  indeed , and that is a necessary evil born out of dire circumstances . 
  there needs to be a public say about who rules the people , yet does there also need to be a public say about * specific * policy ? 
  democracy is great in preventing tyranny , yet not so great in ensuring good and reasonable policy . 
  that 's the issue with referendums : the question is limited to a specific yet often complicated subject , contrarily to elections . 
  election results are vaguer : they give a ` general direction ' , which elected politicians can interpret at will . 
  it gives room to manoevre , where an outcome of the likes of this does not . 
   so - to me - democracy as it is is a terribly frail and easily manipulated system , even assuming there are no ballot manipulations . 
  fully agreed : just look at the media campaigns of the last months in the uk . 
  i 'm not overreacting : it were some of the ** worst media campaigns ** i have ** ever ** witnessed in my life . 
  the demagogy reached epic levels - and downright lies were not shunned to convince the electorate . 
   no , but when they did n't take the uk 's requests for a real reform seriously , they basically made it happen . 
  our ideas about that can differ of course : the uk was given what was possible in europe at that point - and the eu did do some good concessions to cameron . 
  more was likely impossible after all : the eu is a conglomerate of many nations with many own interests : it 's already remarkable so many states were willing to concede so much to one other member state . 
  that already was proof to a preferential treatment . 
   it is n't a stunt . 
  also , wales voted for leave and many many scots voted for leave too . 
  it sure could be seen as a stunt : this was a * protest * vote , after months of misinformation . 
  really , after seeing the front pages of some of the most infamous tabloids of the uk dealing with the eu ( often together with some ` gossip ' story on the same front page ) i already feared this was going to happen : many people are easily swayed after all - even if it goes against their own best interests . 
  i believe there 's a mandate for a new scottish independence referendum , and in this case i 'm quite sure how that one will turn out . 
  also , if you meant to imply that the scots can not hold a new referendum because the matter has been ` dealt with ' some time ago - in different circumstances - than you ca n't uphold that position . 
  after all : the map changed after yesterday ( de facto , albeit not yet de jure ) and the scottish people got the right to vote again after this event . 
  a departure of northern ireland is also no longer unimaginable , even though the odds of that are slimmer than scotland leaving . 
  would n't you say this is a negative thing ? 
  because at the end of the day the english as well as the welsh voted in favour of brexit : the other peoples of the uk did not as it turns out . 
  therefore cameron might have presided over a double catastrophe . 
   also , this is a good opportunity for you to sort out your currency , create a real fiscal union and transfer vast sums of money from the netherlands to greece . 
  hopefully the dutch people will do this , because this is going to become more and more necessary . 
  a repeat of what happened in the uk yesterday is extremely dangerous . 
  if anything , yesterdays referendum proved how flawed this instrument is altogether . 
  i rejoice at the fact there 's no legal mechanism for it in the netherlands , as well as no majority in the second chamber to make it possible - as we could be seeing the same smear campaigns as in the uk in case a ` nexit ' referendum would be held here . 
  people have pretty much forgotten about the disaster that is greece , and there 's no need to stir up unrest about past decisions . 
  especially if people in their everyday lives are n't affected by it - as is the reality here in the netherlands today . 
   `` we have no eternal allies , and we have no perpetual enemies . 
  our interests are eternal and perpetual , and those interests it is our duty to follow ... '' perfidious albion confirmed ? 
  here 's another question for you : did the rest of europe ask for this ? 
  i really doubt it , and this little stunt by predominantly the english has already caused financial ripples among european stock exchanges . 
  the euro is falling dramatically , together with the pound sterling . 
  there 's little positive to be recognized at this point : the positive things that were promised after a brexit are in the distant future and shrouded with great uncertainty . 
  the times ahead will result in economical , financial and political instability : it 's difficult to be grateful to the uninformed and misinformed masses for just that !, 
  but well , congratulations after all i guess . 
  i was utterly convinced you were wrong in the end , but it seems like you were right after all . 
  the margin was slim , but it was there : the uk is in favor of gambling its future on vague promises of turning fortunes and i for one am very interested in how this will turn out - especially after the uk has completely poisoned the mood at the negotiating table . 
  from a spanish perspective maybe : in that case i can agree . 
  but in a diplomatic sense ? 
  come on now . 
  what should be the case aside , this is the legal reality here in the netherlands at the moment . 
  there is no legal mechanism for a referendum on the eu in existence at this moment . 
  not necessarily : we have no constitutional ban on referendums , and all our specific legislation regarding elections is further described in ` ordinary ' laws . 
  so we could make it possible by changing the law , but there 's certainly not a majority for that in the netherlands . 
  no by far !, 
  well to be more precise : we ca n't hold one at all . 
   any membership from which leaving is impossible is ludicrous sorry to say , but this type of comment does annoy me to some extent . 
  this framework has been there already , for years to be precise . 
  in short : the possibility has always been there !, 
  the treaties were updated some time ago with an ` escape ' clause ( i believe this is since lisbon ) so there 's already a procedure set out for the uk . 
  there will be a lot of legal headache though , that 's for sure . 
  beatiful what cameron presided over , is n't it ? 
  he must be one of the worst british prime ministers if you look at this track record . 
  it 's quite possible that cameron ( indirectly ) presided over a double disaster : - the departure of the uk out of europe . 
  - the breakup of the united kingdom . 
  i feel sad how the random mood of yesterday 's voters got such huge impliciations for your country and the peoples living in it . 
  but the eu will survive : that entity will not fall apart as there 's simply too much at stake in other countries that are satisfied with the current state of affairs . 
  of course not . 
  if there 's anyone to blame here by the way it 's the tabloids with their lying campaign towards the eu , that manipulated the narrative with false threaths for months on end . 
  a shame how that resulted in yesterday 's outcome . 
  shocked , terribly shocked . 
  what follows is a harsh opinion , salty even , yet i ask others to respect it . 
  especially since i believe this referendum was a mistake , regardless of yesterdays outcome . 
  from the very beginning i 've said that this referendum was a terrible idea : the subject at hand is just too complex . 
  i 've seen many people throughout the years here passionately disagreeing with me on that subject , claiming that general elections ( more a necessary evil in my eyes ) are pretty comparable to referenda , so why not let the people decide about * specific * subjects ? 
  well , if you were looking for further proof why referenda are a bad idea : look at the british referendum . 
  the misinformation campaign was huge throughout the months , reaching it 's height towards the end of the brexit debate . 
  immigration especially ( something i 'm personally certainly not a fan of ) was used as a tool to strike fear into the hearts on the british public - varied with donald trump-esque ideas about ` better deals ' that are ` sure ' to follow . 
  the media overall , especially the brexit-camp , partook in a huge smear campaign , where journalistic values were utterly cast aside . 
  some tabloids with a massive audience completely forgot they had a responsibility to bring factual news , instead of inciting the people with slander and false promises . 
  tell you what : the uk ( or moreover , england and wales ) have completely poisoned the mood at the negotiating table . 
  it 's a thing that crossed my mind before : why would the eu nations , in face of a * possibly * collapsing eu be kind to the uk now when it comes to trade deals ? 
  especially when the eu has to look strong in the aftermath of this referendum : it ca n't appear as if it gives the uk a deal which benefits them tremendously - making an eu-exit for other nations worthwhile as well . 
  the uk will slide into a deep recession . 
  other european countries will be damaged by the disaster that david cameron presided over : moscow will be very happy with what happened here today . 
  that 's the reality we 're dealing with here . 
  in a way , this referendum has shown the huge shortcomings democracy shows in contemporary society . 
  people are easily swayed by a few points that deal with maybe 1 to 5 % of the overall subject regarding such meta questions as the fate of country x in the eu , and i have no doubt in my minds that most british people ( and the same goes for the rest of europe , including the netherlands ) are completely unable to decide what is ` right ' in situations as these . 
  while this victory will be advertised as a victory for democracy as well , given the level of misinformation one could say democracy clearly is the long-term loser after this all . 
  also , why were the polls and the bookies off so much ? 
  i find this to be highly curious albeit still possibly coincidental , given the bad weather in parts of the uk and the earlier warnings that pro-eu people might not feel compelled to go out and vote in the same numbers . 
  ** edit ** : [ well , at least i was right about the turnout !, 
  thank you bookmakers . 
  for god sake what a dreadful timing on the part of spain . 
  does n't a politician like margallo understand it 's not the time for this type of rash action ? 
  it comes over as threathening - and as support for the leave camp as well . 
  edit : apparantly it should be seen in the light of elections . 
  it 's still irresponsible though . 
  for context : this survey done by motivaction was later debunked as being very flawed . 
  results were afterwards never replicated again , and there was already a lot of upheaval among young turks in the netherlands after the results were made known - with many of them claiming the results were inaccurate . 
  there was quite some fallout in the media after this survey was published . 
  fair enough : we can all disagree on that peacefully . 
  i have to say , ` as long as it does n't bother me ' is also an archtypical dutch attitude in such situations  .
