  this only appears to be the case according to research . 
  that image was also [ shattered last year ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/12/16/helft-turkse-en-marokkaanse-nederlanders-voelt-zich-nog-turks-of-marokkaans ) when it turned out both moroccan-dutch and turkish-dutch citizens still feel predominantly turkish or moroccan . 
  the thing is that you get the subconscious idea that turks are more integrated as they cause much less trouble for society and because they do not engage that much ( if not at all ) in organised street terror . 
  that however does not prove anything about how integrated turks in the netherlands are . 
  truth be told , both ` groups ' are equally visible in dutch society . 
  it 's just that moroccans as a people have a ( much ) worse track record - making them the main target of hatred in contemporary dutch society . 
  turkish youth are certainly less represented in criminality statistics , even though compared to the moroccan-dutch part of the population they perform about as poorly when it comes down to integration . 
  i can remember some research from or 1 or 2 years ago claiming that there 's more social control among turks in the netherlands ( which is arguably a good thing in many respects ! ), 
  yet it also results in the turkish-dutch society being inverted to their own . 
  it 's more of double edged sword . 
  true , erdogan 's idea of islam is worrying and will guarantee a non-secular turkey in the near future . 
  that 's why i indeed do not want turkey to join the eu because it 's getting more and more less-secular and more islamic with each passing day . 
  turkey joining will cause too much strife . 
  strange : i would n't expect to be in agreement with that megalomaniac ( ever ) , but everything is possible it seems . 
  many brain cells were lost by glancing at the front covers of the sun and daily mail . 
  my god , such terrible ` journalism ' those papers engage in . 
  it always makes you consider banning them just to protect the public . 
  i can assure you that is n't the case . 
  moreover , i 'm probably one of the last persons on this subreddit to throw around the word fascism to describe a form of government in country x. 
  thing is , that did n't happen : i just repeated something that seemed absurd to read months ago , yet reading it back it did have * some * truth . 
  by the way , i 've seen more spaniards remarking on this subject over the past few years : apparantly it 's not too uncommon of a complaint , though i of course get where you 're coming from . 
  there was no direct comparison between ` fascism ' and ` spain ' , if it 's still necessary to clear that much up . 
  well , not directly to fascism : more like the legacy * of * fascism . 
  and even then the link is marginal , as was said elsewhere . 
  i mostly found it interesting seeing how that weird comment from so many months ago was still partially accurate - even when it back then seemed a bit grotesque in the eyes of a foreigner . 
  the link is limited at best , but i did find it interesting as there is a bit of truth to it in the end . 
  but let us indeed not overreact : it 's just that this type of behavior testifies to the presence of old political structures , where foul play is n't really shunned altogether . 
  let 's indeed see how this further develops : the near future might prove interesting . 
  i can remember some spanish guy commenting on another person here on / r/europe many months ago . 
  that person remarked on the fascist history of spain , with him in return saying ` fascism never left spain ' . 
  seems like he was right in * some * way or another after all . 
  producing false accusations to destroy the credibility of your political rivals is something straight out of history . 
  by the way , is p\u00fablico the only newspaper that has verified this , or are others doubting the story ? 
  do n't worry , rumour has it brussels got its own petyr baelish on standby . 
  they 'll be sending herman van rompuy to the uk as soon as this referendum is over , as ` administrator ' of those damn islands . 
  i think you overestimate the foresight of the leave camp . 
  as we 're looking forward already : is anyone planning to place a bet at the bookmakers - or has anyone done so already ? 
  i wonder if more / r/europe regulars are planning to do the same . 
  i believe a life sentence without parole is possible in the uk . 
  i agree that people like this guy need to be taken out of society for good , but death is not the way to do it - ever . 
  murder remains murder no matter who commits it , and there 's no such thing as ` good ' murder . 
  not to mention that there 's a lot to be said about the death penalty being self defeating : by punishing someone that committed the crime of murder by inflicting a very similar sentence there is little moral highground to be acknowledged would n't you say ? 
  i 'd rather have such people rot in a cell for the rest of their lives . 
  on a sidenote : i 'm also against the current trend of the echr to call life imprisonment without a chance of parole a ` cruel ' punishment . 
  this option should always remain open so we can select unwanted people out of society . 
  profits over truthful reporting and proper journalistic standards . 
  ' i care about europe , yet other people that do n't agree with me can better die ' . 
  ` i 'm not glad she 's dead , but i 'm glad she 's gone ' just boils down to ` i 'm glad she 's dead , but i 'd rather not say it ' . 
  this is really shocking rhetoric , fully lacking in respect for dignity of human life . 
  as / u/benthetraveler said : your rhetoric is worrying . 
  it truly is , despite what others think of it : it is extremely black and white and highly simplistic . 
  just look at it :  the left never has any arguments in this issue impossible statement . 
  you ca n't argue this is true without knowing everyone that remotely shares left-wing beliefs . 
  ` never ' is first and foremost an absolute statement . 
   i know it 's impossible for those detached from reality to come up with any rational arguments , strawman : ' i disagree with your statement , so your statement is irrational ' . 
   you got absolutely nothing to base your comment on . 
  you 're just pissed because someone is writing the ugly truth your beloved media and leaders are denying from you . 
  this is basically another full sophism , specifically ad hominem . 
   you are seriously detached from reality ... 
  truth be told , this again is nothing but another ad hominem . 
   got ta love the pc reddit , where no truth shall see the daylight , when the hordes of dreamers charge in . 
  another strawman . 
  it also gives a very absolute picture of ` reddit ' as some place where people with uniform thoughts come together to discuss their equally uniform ideas . 
  in short , you did n't really present counter arguments . 
  you just disagree out of ` feelings ' , not due to objective information to the contrary . 
  may i ask where you get these ideas ? 
  because you either suffer from a massive confirmation bias where you pull out one borderline comment out of thousand and equal those to ` reddit ' , or you 're just a follower of / pol / or similar places that always manipulate the narrative in a highly ideological fashion . 
  newsflash : the ` left ' does n't exist . 
  just like ` the right ' . 
  they 're descriptive terms to indicate the presence of some meta-beliefs among a larger group of people , and not as ** absolute truths ** as you seem to believe here . 
  there are strong designations that you do just that : your entire comment creates a false and utterly irrealistic `` us vs them '' narrative that is firmly in the realm of fantasy . 
  no idea why you need to drag islam into this discussion as well . 
  you come over as one of those fanatics that just wants to throw it into any discussion no matter how far-fetched the link is in the first place ( as it is here ) . 
   the real racists are the lefties against their own people . 
  ` them ' vs ` the people ' . 
  this is sadly another strawman , with you defining those who agree with you as ` the people ' and those who do n't as ` not the people ' . 
  when you get a little bit older you 'll see how utterly false this is and testifying to a highly simplistic world view , but i 'm not going to hold back just because it would you the idea you ' r even remotely right . 
  get off the internet , talk with people out there and moderate your viewpoints . 
  i 'm saying this because you 're living outside of reality at the moment . 
  the fact that you do n't dare to react to the merits of what he said suggests you are clueless about how to respond to his striking comparison . 
  all political violence , by all people in disregard of what they believe in , is unacceptable . 
  you would do well to read some other media outlets then the ones that have feed you the garbage you posted above . 
  open your mind , study both sides and know that you are just being gullible . 
  do n't get carried away in the heat of the moment . 
  we lock such people up for life in europe - which is also a much tougher punishment if you ask me . 
  state sanctioned murder on the other hand is not the way to go . 
  well , i know stuff happened in that past that probably still happens today . 
  the thing is that ` guessing ' that ` x ' happened just because you ` think ' it would happen - and then believing in it more than any real clue out there is beyond stupid . 
  it is a feeling not based on any objective information , born out of a * pathological distrust * towards the world around you . 
  some have even said it 's a ` coping mechanism ' for people that hate or refuse to believe how the world works . 
  you can believe nothing that way though , not a single thing in life : everything could be a lie . 
  if you really want to live in such a world , where conjecture gets the same status as facts , well , in that case you might consider stepping out of it all . 
  in the meanwhile i 'll stick to what experts and the people with actual knowledge about subject x have to say about it . 
  you should as well . 
  at least you should remember that you are fantasizing here , instead of making assumptions based on some loose facts . 
  there is nothing that points at a false flag operation here besides the timing , and that there 's some guy that kills a politician during the heat of a national debate is an easy other explanation . 
  you know what the thing is with conspiracy thinkers like you ? 
  they consciously or unconsciously blur the line between ** reality ** and ** fantasy ** . 
  you 're doing just that : you just assume it 's a conspiracy by ` the elites ' that pulled off a false flag operation . 
  in a way you 're not that much different than some religious guy that believes god is talking to him : in both cases both people make stuff up based on zero evidence .
