  both murders shook the netherlands on its foundations : the impact was severe and widespread and coverage about the murders and what followed afterwards lasted for months on end . 
  he was right bringing in van gogh as well : both were ` high profile ' murders of influential persons that had massive societal fall out . 
  the same will happen here . 
  this is what i dislike so much about / r/europe nowadays : you need to add a thousand disclaimers to prevent some guy filling in the gaps for you . 
  once more :  you 're defending the people getting upset and threatening violence i - did - ** not ** . 
  point out where i did so , as i did n't at all . 
  you should n't just make stuff up because you think in schematics . 
  the simple fact that i condemn britain first does n't mean i 'm a stereotypical left-wing apologist . 
  for god sake i 'm even right wing . 
  did * you * actually watch it ? 
  i watched it several times front to start , and i simply condemn them all . 
  i have great difficulty understanding why you want to side with these provocateurs that want to instigate unrest in society . 
  because do n't forget that last part : their goal is just that . 
  you should side with neither : they 're all worthless people . 
  i defend none : both are just disgusting ** scum ** . 
  that 's the message , and you should n't protect those other idiots as well - that are just out for confrontation . 
  it goes beyond saying that britain got a massive problem with muslims in their own country ( e.g. 
  the setting up a parallel societies is a nice example ) , yet it goes too far to defend the rabble that wants to instigate widespread violence and hatred by their actions . 
  britain first is the same kind of extreme as the so called sharia patrols that used to happen in london . 
  neither should have any place in the uk , or any european country in that regard . 
  edit : hi brigaders . 
  having a nice time again , are n't we ? 
  you fail to see the context in which it happens . 
  here 's [ a link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa6xcyxsxxu ) to get the right picture and why i consider it to be cringelike . 
  they 're extremists in their own right , albeit the other side of the coin . 
  i 'd also advise you to look into britain first and what that party stands for . 
  if they would be celebrating mass or something outside , or holding a precession , i would n't be bothered by it at all . 
  exactly . 
  this is one of their [ flashy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa6xcyxsxxu ) videos . 
  if you want to resist against islam go right ahead : in my eyes it 's a backwards religion . 
  but the way these people do it is just beyond simple cringe : it 's also dishonest ( look at us , we 're holding crosses and thus are christian !, 
  apparantly the attacker - according to some eyewitness - shouted ` britain first ! ', 
  before attacking her . 
  for those unfamiliar with britain first : they 're a [ far right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/britain_first ) party in the uk . 
  they have really cringelike videos on youtube where they go out on the streets with christian crosses just to provoke others . 
  ** edit : ** it should be clear that this is still unconfirmed . 
  take it with a grain of salt in that sense : it could very well be true , but the opposite can just as easily apply . 
  ** edit 2 : ** jo cox has died as a result of her injuries . 
   nevertheless , the other true is that they do not adapt to the culture of the country they reside . 
  that 's just fact : your observation is completely true when speaking of the * ( grand ) majority * of muslims . 
  i thought i 'd add that nuance : few muslims in the netherlands actually fully integrate into society , but they do exist . 
  still , the problems around those that do n't are huge . 
   you can call me racist if you want , do n't worry , i 'm not like ` those ' people . 
  i really rarely use that word at all , and only when i 'm sure . 
  there 's enough room for your opinion here . 
  of course that 's true - and actually i agree with it . 
  the thing is that there is still a drastic overestimation of the account of muslims in poland - and one can wonder where those ideas come from . 
  surely , the mass media almost exclusively portray islam in a negative sense ( not to say that there 's that much positive to report about it from a western perspective ) yet to overestimate the amount of muslims in your country fiftyfold ( !! ), 
  borders on sheer paranoia would n't you say ? 
  especially poland . 
  polish people here are not seldomly the most harsh and outspoken opponents of muslims and seemingly very concerned about them overall , yet the average pole will likely never meet one in their own country . 
  it is confusing at first sight : why be so dramatically preoccupied with something you 'll never come across ? 
  anschl\u00fcss please then . 
  we could use some more \u00f6rdnung here . 
  just for clarity : the netherlands does n't completely . 
  we still speak of ` the matter of the armenian genocide ' instead of ` the armenian genocide ' . 
  the parliament is in majority pro-recognition ( and did so in a recent motion ) , but the government is n't out of diplomatic concerns it seems . 
  just for the sake of argument , it [ has worked before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mincome ) during prior experiments . 
  maybe this is not the ` large scale ' you are talking about , but there is some serious food for thought that it could work . 
  by the way : i do n't like this entire ubi discussion on reddit . 
  i think it 's mostly a certain subgroup of people that is attracted to it ( teens that are at a loss about what to do in life , unemployed people , etc. ), 
  and personally i 'm not really attracted to ubi unless there would be widespread and structural unemployment to the point that the fabric of society would be threathened . 
  but to say there is no link with automation or that it is pure conjecture ( besides past experiments ) is false play - even for an opponent of ubi . 
  another magnificant piece from tayyip erdogan . 
  to all turks that voted this guy into office : once again , well done !, 
  no need for a violent overthrow so that the idiotic side of society can rule there : it has already been arranged via the ballot box . 
  so far , it appears to be so much quicker as well !, 
  such a terrible article . 
  the guardian indeed went completely overboard here - and the article itself is poorly written . 
  it 's basically one huge godwin argument without the necessary justification for it in the first place . 
  this article is lost as soon as the guardian started to compare the people that voted fp\u00d6 with the nazis . 
  upvoted so that people can read this drivel though . 
   at the cost of personal liberties ? 
  not at the cost of the most basic of human rights , let me * very clear * about that . 
  but it could go at the ( partial ) cost of some other liberties ( whether written down or not ) , such as passive suffrage . 
  in a meritocracy , not everyone will be fit to lead thus passive suffrage ( a human right in certain treaties if i 'm not mistaken , as well as a basic right in the dutch constitution and many others ) will be reduced . 
   this creates a new problem : constitutions need to be changed from time to time . 
  do you want to delegate this completely onto the citizens ? 
  who chooses the judges of the constitutional court ? 
  currently , our two chambers decide on that . 
  i dislike judges elected by the public . 
  that 's a really good question and a challenging one as well . 
  i 'm quite convinced that the instrument of referendum will be needed as a necessary safeguard to prevent constitutional rights just taken away ` like that ' with the people having no say in it whatsoever . 
  the rulers will of course have the prerogative when it comes down to drawing up proposals about changes , yet the people will have to approve of it . 
  i think this will create a strong balance between the executive and the people , although it could be strengthened by popular initiatives ( without a government proposal ) even though i 'm not a great fan of such ideas . 
  judges should remain career judges ( for god sake , let us not bring in the american system ! ), 
  that choose their superiors from their own ranks . 
  since you ca n't roll into the judiciary if you are of ` unclean ' character , i think such a system could work without much problem . 
  it again could be mediated a bit by requiring 1/3th or 1/2th of all supreme court judges be confirmed by parliament . 
   this would turn these people into some kind of `` politician 2.0 '' . 
  it would also be a lot like iran for example , where an unelected council allows and denys people to stand in elections . 
  which is something we criticize . 
  and this is the real pickle : this observation touches the core problem of meritocracy . 
  after all , ` who ' is ` fit ' to lead in the first place ? 
  i 've reasoned that this can actually be rationally and objectively decided by academic or mixed committees by use of an elaborate , yet not overly complicated system . 
  simple factors like achievements ( true merit ) , having fitting credentials and overall experience could be the necessary factors to fill in the gaps , preferably standardized in a rigid system . 
  it is not impossible , yet there 's a great deal of potential problems to keep away in that case . 
  without a doubt , such a ` selection system ' could only come into existence of thoroughly thinking it over several times . 
   i still think that it is too dangerous to actually change our systems in this way . 
  we certainly need to improve democracy somehow , but so far we have found no way to do it .
