  i respect that opinion : there are dangers involved after all . 
  on my side there 's this idea those dangers can be sufficiently compensated by strengthening judicial control , yet even then one can not be sure . 
  but to improve democracy will prove impossible when the most inexperienced and opportunistic politicians can still create low quality laws ( a lack of merit/experience ) while still being reinforced by it ( short term vision , electoral rewards ) . 
  it 's a damn difficult topic , let us agree on that . 
  from that point of view your position is of course perfectly logical , yet we differ on a crucial part of it , maybe the foundation of the entire argument :  it would be horrible for us to trade away a system that works decently although democracy got a long list of advantages and has brought a lot of good to the world , i do not consider it to be infallible and moreover , i do n't think it works decently * enough * . 
  it creates too many unworkable compromises , results in compromises of bad legal character ( at least here in the netherlands ) and seems to be extremely oriented on the short term . 
  while the autocrats in china are planning for the long term , we are still bickering about the most trivial of short term problems in our own countries . 
  this should worry you as well , as in the end it could result in the destruction * of * our democracies : a country with internal problems will manifest problems in a wide range of subjects , including vital state tasks like taxation and defense . 
  i just want us to be prepared for every bit of strife ( internal and external ) that will doom up in the decades to come , and democracy in its current form does n't seem to be a convincing problem solver at this point . 
  meritocracy could be done by strengthening the judiciary ( making it more powerful and independent ) , as well as by giving the academic world more power in decision making . 
  the goal should be taking the * correct * decision after all , not the decision that can be sold in the best way in an electoral sense . 
  the constitution could in turn work as a dampener on such a system , to prevent the ` rulers ' from infringing on the people 's best interests . 
  also , to add to the latter , the criminal code in a country with meritocracy should be updated with extremely harsh sentences for corruption/nepotism , to make sure it can never get a hold on such a system . 
  after all , true meritocracy * will * result in a drastic limitation ( de facto or de jure ) of passive suffrage , while active suffrage could probably still exist . 
  but it 's just an idea . 
  we should look for a democracy 2.0 , or whatever you want to call it , that 's the bottom line here  . 
  as long as we consider all alternatives , we 'll be on the right path . 
   in recent times . 
  exactly . 
  you know why ? 
  because we have n't tried - * at all * . 
  experiences from 70 years ago become less valid with each passing century , due to the drastic changes in society and the rise in the overall level of intelligence and education among the people . 
  we should be open to alternatives ( for example meritocracy , just to name an example ) instead of discarding them based on close to zero present day experiences . 
  or would you say that is unreasonable ? 
  china is still developing , and although there are major differences between the several classes in chinese society , it 's not like the average joe there got nothing : a strong middle class is after all developing at the moment . 
  a couple of billionairs does n't make that less true . 
  the standard of living in china overall is rising and has been rising in that country for decades by now , under a very autocratic government . 
  it also was autocracy that turned singapore into a strong and well-established state and it has brought great wealth to that country . 
  just to be on the safe side : do n't read this as a love letter to autocratic systems . 
  i just want to point out there are alternatives out there , while skipping the merits of said alternatives . 
  china , singapore . 
  there are examples , though there are obvious downsides as well . 
  but let us not give in to the false statement that democracy is ` the final form of government ' : we have n't experimented enough with alternatives to even come close to that conclusion . 
  democracy is a good aggregator of opinions , yet a poor problem solver . 
  it has a lot of issues that are often overlooked . 
  it is . 
  this is the typical 4chan method to illicit responses , mostly with trolling as a main goal . 
  it has become so clear nowadays that it 's just boring . 
  exactly : congratulations to van der bellen , but that 's where the celebration should end . 
  austria has shown to be a deeply divided nation - and the result of this election is tantamount to that given fact . 
  it will take a lot of time to heal the differences between about 49,5 + % of the population and its rulers . 
  well i 'm pointing this out because the bbc got a certain reputation in the uk , and therefore i always take whatever it says with an extra pinch of salt . 
  it has often been accused of a left wing bias ( which is not done for a state funded media entity ) - and it also worries me when state funded media outlets engage in partial or misleading reporting . 
  sorry for messing up the order apparantly , though i do n't consider it to be that important . 
  van der bellen won with a majority of the votes - and austria certainly wo n't suddenly be doomed or something . 
  it 's not like the fpo is n't without criticism as we both know . 
   mr hofer , of the freedom party , had tapped into anti-eu sentiment and ** fears ** about rising numbers of asylum seekers . 
  you can ask yourself why the bbc needs to use the term ` fears ' again instead of ` concerns ' , which implies a wholly different mindset . 
  the bias is showing again , just like the dutch nos over here . 
  congratulations to van der bellen though . 
  do everyone here a favor , and take your grossly misinformed positions and moreover theories elsewhere / u/stumping4trump . 
  i imagine there are low quality `` ca n't stump the trump '' videos to watch for you or something , instead of entertaining us with these vague , absolute ideas about european society . 
  not to mention the conspiracy idiocy that seems to resound in some of your comments ( e.g. 
  left wing teachers ` converting ' young people as if it is some organised attempt ) . 
  check his username . 
  you should add eussr as well , makes it even more edgy !, 
  yes and no . 
  in my experience they often vote on the basis of one or two issues , which they find highly important . 
  there sure is comprehension of the subject in that sense ( even if it would be shallow ) yet details are often just glanced over or just ignored . 
  i doubt if such limited understanding of everything what 's at stake makes one morally eligible to vote , as democracy in itself could theoretically self destruct due to a misinformed electorate . 
  that 's the pickle here , but until i 'm sure about it i 'll just maintain the position that everyone 18 years or older should be able to vote . 
  even if one is wildly misinformed ( for example disagreeing with the stance of the party you vote for on like 70 % of subjects , yet still voting for it based on two main subjects ) he/she should for now still be allowed to do so . 
  whether it 's a smart idea to maintain the current system in the long run is another discussion though . 
  nor was that suggested . 
  relevant example : some time back there was a poll here in the netherlands among the voters from several political parties . 
  it turned out that those belonging to the pvv ( as well , in a lesser sense , those voting for the sp if i 'm not mistaken ) had the most difficulty getting their facts straight about national politics . 
  a staggering amount of pvv voters for example thought wilders was a minister . 
  that does say something about the intelligence of the people voting for e.g. 
  the pvv , but that 's about it . 
  the only thing we can say about it is that there 's a trend all around the west of the lower educated voting for these parties , and i ** do not blame ** them for doing so . 
  what you vote for should n't be anyone 's concern , provided you know what you vote for in the first place . 
  the latter part is where it starts to sting though . 
  i guess that explains why everybody that studied law at my university in the past was so right wing . 
  also : there 's a difference between avoiding and being eligible in the first place . 
  maybe you 're right about an overall * slight * tendency to the left , but that is intrinsically connected to the nature of science itself . 
  without being more openminded about new ideas than the average person , you 'll likely not get far in any scientific discipline . 
  i 'm right wing myself , yet for me it 's beyond any doubt that leftwingers are more open to new things than rightwingers . 
  the thing is that this tends to result in naivity and wild experimenting on the left , which is why right wing politics are in a moderate form the superior alternative for now . 
  to the point that you do n't even know what said party you vote for stands for , or for example do n't even know the difference between government and parliament ? 
  sorry if this troubles you , but people that fail to correctly answer the most basic questions about their democracy , e.g. 
  ` what does the house of commons do ' * maybe * should n't be allowed to vote in the first place . 
  i say * maybe * because i quoted an often heard example here in the netherlands . 
  i do feel something for it , yet i 'm not properly convinced about actually implementing it , nor did i propose we should . 
  democracy is great , yet it should not descend into becoming a parody of itself . 
  i completely reject your accusation of a ` superiority complex ' : this is just common sense . 
  the same here in the netherlands regarding the pvv for example : its electorate is on average the least educated among all the other parties , though we should warn against judging too quickly against a party just because it draws the lower educated towards them . 
  although , as some comedian here once stated : maybe we should just ask 5 * really easy * questions about politics at the ballot box . 
  if people fail to answer 4 out of 5 questions properly , their voting pass should be shredded before their eyes - in which case they can try again a few years later . 
   ~ ~ liberal ~ ~ left wing politicians . 
  there you go . 
  liberalism is way too broad of a political family to characterize as being similar to the left , while the latter as well is a large , descriptive term . 
  liberalism for example can also be right wing ( liberal-conservatism ) , and the fact that someone from europe uses liberal in the wrong context again really disappoints me . 
  i guess it 's the influence of american media outlets and organisations ( including reddit , 4chan , etc. 
  ) : it 's difficult to see another reason . 
  i take it vienna - as a major city - is more leaning towards vdb than hofer , correct ? 
  edit : thanks for all your answers !, 
  well , i tried to be a bit more careful and draw on my own experiences , but i ca n't be surprised about your statement it 's a global thing . 
  the thing i find curious is that this trend 1 on 1 corresponds with the rise of the internet . 
  it is my conviction that it has really changed people for the worst in things like these , as you can find resonance just about everywhere on the internet , no matter how extreme your ideas are , with little punishment . 
  but then again , the media in my experience has also become more pronounced - to the point that some outlets are deliberately misguiding their viewers in such a way that one can no longer speak of proper journalism .
