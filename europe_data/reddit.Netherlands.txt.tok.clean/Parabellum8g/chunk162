  interesting . 
  thank you for giving your view on the matter . 
  truth be told , they are n't . 
  right winger myself here , and you are pulling a faux victim role here . 
  right wingers in my experience nearly never - ever - get compared to nazis . 
  unless you were referring to the extreme right with respect to ` right wingers ' , as those people are routinely labeled as such - and mostly with good reason . 
  in each case , as a moderate right winger that kind of nonsense has never hit me or anyone else with moderate right views around me . 
  how so if i may ask ? 
  you got me curious here . 
  this seems like a normal conviction of such violence , and the painful comparison between the people destroying property in hamburg and rioting brownshirts is pretty justified in my view . 
  exactly . 
  i am getting really disappointed in the droves of people thinking it is * that simple * . 
  ` left ' and ` right ' are descriptive terms , nothing more . 
  you can not use it to describe some kind of ` camps ' as if it was a soccer match . 
  ` the entire leftist part of the media ' . 
  ridiculous that kind of simplification is allowed to stay on / r/europe without moderation . 
  it paints all people on the left with the same brush and really is an attack on truth in itself . 
   if you think this is some lefty vs the right thing , i really do n't give a shit about that . 
  where did you even read this ??? 
  this really baffles me . 
  and illegal use of the right to self defense is nothing else but applying an ad hoc death penalty . 
  that 's why there are such strict requirements around self defense in many countries around the world . 
   that 's pretty specific , is this some sort of projection ? 
  how so ? 
  plenty of people try to make use of the right to self defense in such a way that malicious thought can be switched to malicious action , without being punished . 
  the abuse of ` castle law ' type-legislation in the us is an example of that . 
  difficult to see how this could be ` projection ' : you are choosing the wrong words here in my view . 
   and that 's why i said that whether they get shot depends on their actions after that . 
  they can either back off , or attack me , in which case it 's self protection . 
  at which we agree , but what did you say * exactly * ? 
  here we go :  it 's not about the death penalty , it 's about self protection . 
  you do n't use force to punish , you use force to protect yourself * and * your property . 
  which you use in response to / u/eepithst who talks about the de facto application of a death penalty . 
  you are also staying deliberately vague about what measures you would like to see in such situations , and in my opinion that 's a massive red flag for people with extreme thoughts , as i 've seen so often on this sub by now . 
  if you are n't , you should 've phrased it less ambigious . 
  you are creating a lot of suspicion about your possibly true motivations this way . 
  self protection of property is the excuse here , the enabler to justify sick thoughts about killing others . 
  it 's nothing but a veil for thoughts that should n't be protected by law . 
  if someone attacks your property , you call the police or use non lethal force to stop it . 
  you can only reasonably kill someone to protect yourself , not your property . 
  ( google translate ) ** gabriel compares hamburg rioters with neonazis ** foreign minister sigmar gabriel fears that the riots harm germany 's reputation . 
  `` germany 's image is seriously affected by the events in hamburg . '', 
  `` the democratic state must now prove its defensiveness . '', 
  the riots on the brink of the g-20 summit in hamburg are , according to the federal foreign minister , sigmar gabriel ( spd ) germany 's reputation in the world . 
  `` germany 's image in the international public is heavily affected by the events in hamburg , '' writes gabriel in a guest contribution for the `` bild am sonntag '' . 
  there was an `` orgy of brutality '' . 
  the incomprehensible violence must not be without consequences . 
  to the perpetrators `` from all parts of europe '' it was only `` about violence in itself '' , writes gabriel further . 
  they differed `` not at all from neo-nazis and their fire attacks '' . 
  with alleged left motives this has nothing to do . 
  gabriel called for a europe-wide cooperation in the search for the offenders . 
  for this , `` all possible legal means should be used '' . 
  `` the democratic state must now prove its defensiveness , '' gabriel demanded . 
  federal president frank-walter steinmeier has defended hamburg 's selection as a place for the g-20 summit even after the riots of the past days . 
  `` a democratically fortified country like germany should also have self-confidence and say : yes , such conferences must not only be , but if they have to be , they can also take place with us and we will guarantee that , '' he said in hamburg . 
  he met during his visit with security forces and affected residents and was accompanied by the criticized mayor olaf scholz ( spd ) . 
  asked whether the security situation had been underestimated before the meeting of the big business nations on friday and saturday , steinmeier said that the media had been warned before the conference that `` hamburg would miss a chance if not a big , international folk festival celebrated here becomes '' . 
  in addition , it was said that the city scrambled too much through exaggerated security measures . 
  that is why `` now and then , with the measure and memory of what was said and written before the g-20 summit , '' we should approach the judgment in retrospect . '', 
  ** juncker found hamburg `` particularly suitable '' ** jean-claude juncker , european commission president , has also expressed a shock about the riots . 
  violence was as incomprehensible as pointless , said juncker to the newspapers of the spark media group . 
  `` burning cars and flying canopies may be loud , but their messages stifled in noise and ruckus , '' he explained . 
  constructive politics could only help to `` shape those who build something together , not those who are angered '' . 
  at the same time , he rejected criticism of the choice of venue . 
  at this summit , about 10,000 delegates would have to be accommodated . 
  `` it 's a bad thing in a village or on a northern island . '', 
  hamburg is also symbolic of global trade . 
  therefore , the hansestadt `` was particularly suitable '' for this year 's summit . 
  politicians from the cdu and fdp demanded a fundamental change in dealing with left-wing extremism . 
  cdu general secretary peter tauber said the `` bild am sonntag '' , that it should be more strongly against extreme left establishments . 
  `` no one would have the idea of simply tolerating right-wing centers , '' tauber said . 
  `` in left-sided centers like the rigaer strasse in berlin and the rote flora in hamburg one was often too reserved . '', 
  christian lindner , head of the christian democratic union , demanded that `` the extreme left scene be much more strongly viewed by the constitution . '', 
  the cdu presidency member jens spahn said the `` bild am sonntag '' , that left wing extremism `` has been downplayed in germany for years '' . 
  spahn specifically challenged the spd , the greens and the left party . 
  in the end , present day democracy is flawed . 
  i think you explictly acknowledged that in the comment above and we both more or less agree on it . 
  in the end though , and that 's where we differ , you condone taking action by means that are not acceptable . 
  why ? 
  the western nations taking part in it are still democracies in the end , and have a significant popular mandate to negotiate exactly those things . 
  if we start to make exceptions to the mandate given by voters , and start taking decisions by illegitimate , forceful means , democracy will be dead . 
  the people using violence in hamburg in essence disapprove of democracy as we know it today . 
  they want to achieve their goals with force and not via the ballot box . 
  ` understandably people are a bit annoyed ' is a massive euphemism , which detracts attention from the violence used . 
  there was plenty of reason for me to shame the person in question by quoting his comment , as this was another way to silently approve of the violence used . 
  you say you disapprove about burning cars , but immediatly after you express a kind of understanding for it happening as well , based on how people vote nowadays . 
  i utterly reject that line of reasoning . 
  you would never be welcome at my home for that reason , as you seem to still deny property rights . 
  about the dutch and irish tax havens : i completely condemn those practices , and especially those that keep that system in existence . 
  it amounts to robbing important tax revenue , billions of it , from developing countries that desperately need it . 
  that 's probably one of the few parts we agree on . 
  multinationals hold way too much sway with respect to how they can influence ( tax ) legislation and the diplomatic leverage they can sometimes use . 
  the way africa is lagging behind at the rest of the developing world is sad , we agree on that , but countless civil wars , ethnic strife and rampant corruption have ensured africa would stay in the position it finds itself today . 
  i think africa 's fate has a lot to do with the lack of political foresight of african leaders , and is therefore indirectly testimony to a culture that lacks in sufficient will to propel the continent and its individual countries forward . 
  european countries are where they are today due to the sheer will of their peoples : double devastation during two world wars , as well as numerous other conflicts in history , did not destroy this continent . 
  africa , however , has not demonstrated the same resolve so far . 
  i would be angry at my government if had to work for zero to no pay . 
  but my government would have failed at protecting me , by not properly organizing the country and not working together with countries in a similar position . 
  that 's the root cause here . 
  you would be a good fascist , you know that ?
