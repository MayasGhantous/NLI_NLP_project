  yes , the people that wreck and torch stuff like yesterday are the highest form of scum out there . 
  but we have no moral superiority left to demonstrate if we just kill them on the spot , based on them being ` maggots ' . 
   i can not begin to understand the reasoning behind this decision . 
  it honestly was nothing more than poking the hornet 's nest and everyone with some common sense could have predicted that the outcome would n't be pretty . 
  i do : the law applies to everyone - and the executive should therefore not flee in the face of possible unrest . 
  that would amount to giving leeway to unacceptable behavior and therefore hamburg was still a suitable place to host the g20 summit . 
  i do understand where you are coming from , but still , we should n't think that way . 
  at the very moment politicians do as you suggest , the rule of law would be endangered , as at that point fear would govern decision making . 
  i do feel for the civilians whose belongings were torched or otherwise destroyed , and that are now left with a lot of misery . 
  the same goes for the police officers that were hurt . 
  they do it appears . 
  no one is convicting towards the damage that has been caused , or the violence that has been used yesterday . 
  really , everybody should go to / r/anarchism now and watch how the community there really is . 
  they are just another set of extremists , that much is without doubt at this point . 
  ** edit : ** some quotes , all to be found [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchism/comments/6lykx5/hamburg_burning_into_the_night/ ) :  cars are just cars , dont fall on the media trap trying to blame comrades . 
  it was war out there and although we all know that facing the forces of repression defeat is inevitable at least for some hours some battles were won . 
  or this one . 
   if we cant enjoy ourselves and get lost in the crazyness of walking in the streets feeling empowered by the comrades around us and the fascination of fire then nothing is worth it . 
  or this . 
   world leaders are deciding on the future of our planet , society and economy without us having any say in the matter . 
  understandably some people are a bit annoyed this one , where someone genuinely asks how you yourself would feel if your car got torched . 
   how would you like it if your car was set on fire ? 
    jokes on u i dont have a car, 
  ` violent vandals ' than . 
  let us not inflate the word ` terrorism ' any further as it already has been over the past few years . 
  it 's a responsibility that falls on all of us , including you . 
  do not use the word terrorism where it does not convincingly apply . 
   the eternal anglo hah , that one is new to me . 
  it 'll make a fine addition to my anglophobic dictionary . 
   german tanks for our dutch booiiisss , we did n't buy any figures . 
  of course we had to be stingy again ( as we lease them ) , this time using diplomatic leverage to drive someone else 's tanks !, 
  not that i can recall . 
  we just sold them off during the crisis to further reduce the budget of the armed forces here . 
  only to buy a handful of semi-new tanks ( i believe from germany ? ), 
  because we deemed it important to maintain knowledge about armored warfare . 
  we are really thinking about invading them , just to settle the score on who 's better . 
  sucks we 'll get fired upon by the same tanks that we sold to them a couple years back . 
  i do not believe that was implied bij / u/svorky . 
  it does mean such an opinion can be valid and * expected * , even though we would disagree with it on a personal level . 
  at least i would . 
  this is actually really interesting . 
  thank you for sharing this piece of information !, 
  i would 've expected them to support a close * ally * , a nato member state , which they did not . 
  that was curious even on the backdrop of bad diplomatic relations and out of sync with swift condemnations by the west of other coup d'etats in the recent past ( mostly in africa , but still ) . 
  they did n't even have to support erdogan , but democracy in turkey . 
  that would 've been enough , but our leaders did n't . 
  understandable , seeing how turkey is going downhill , but peculiar at the same time if you look other swift condemnations in the past . 
  not at all !, 
  you can not possibily conclude that is the only logical conclusion here based on what you just said above . 
  the explanation that was given by the way amounts to the pilots of the fighters jets not being able to reach their commanders , thus refraining from shooting down the jet without prior orders . 
  that is another logical conclusion of what happened , and it certainly is n't the only scenario thinkable . 
  which one is the truth ? 
  i 'd like to stick with the official reading until conspiracy theories around the ` staging ' of the coup get more substance than mere speculation . 
  in a time where relations between nato and the eu are deteriorating such a gesture actually makes sense . 
  if i recall correctly , erdogan and putin met within 2 months after the coup ended , to strengthen ties between russia and turkey . 
  that was a remarkable change , and one that coincided with worsening relationships with the eu and the us post-coup . 
  russia also utterly hates nato ( just check putin his comments on the organisation !, 
  ) , which makes any move to wade turkey away from nato worth it . 
  i took the last reference to ` theory ' out with respect to creationist stories . 
  seems like one remained in the comment above that i missed . 
  you 're right , it 's no theory , contrary to the theory of evolution . 
   you 're comparing some dude 's acid-trip ideas to a well-founded scientific theory . 
  i like how you put it there , hehe . 
  yes , i guess you 're right it 's not a theory , let me adjust that . 
  the knowledge thing is something i am willing to believe : i think he might have been tipped off beforehand by a foreign entity , probably russia . 
  we can not know for sure , but i think this is indeed probable . 
  it 's still different from setting the entire thing up though . 
  whatever the reasons for staging it , it worked massively into favor of the ak party . 
  what happened afterwards , is history . 
  you will always have to make decisions as a school whenever composing a curriculum . 
  subjects of less gravity can therefore be discarded . 
  though you could ask yourself how many people * actually * still believe in creationist theories as of 2017 , and whether that 's enough of a critical mass ( ! ), 
  to teach it . 
  i think you do have a valid point there . 
   there 's no place for beliefs in school . 
  school should only cover facts , that is proven science . 
  in the past i would 've agreed with you , but this line of thinking belongs solely in a fully secular school system . 
  and even then it 's still not perfect . 
  many schools teach philosophy for example to students at a certain level , and that 's far from fact . 
  it still is interesting to take knowledge off though . 
  to set the record straight : i hated any and all religiously inspired material i got during high school , ( very ) limited as it was . 
  but if i would n't have gotten it , formulating counter-arguments against it would have been * harder * for me nowadays . 
  it gives some food for thought , and is therefore important for one 's sense of critical thinking . 
  who spoke about science class ? 
  over here we had a subject called ` levensbeschouwing ' in the past , more or less a mix of all kinds of ( religious ) life philosophies aimed at understanding the bigger questions . 
  creationism would be discussed there , and certainly not in any science class , rest assured about that . 
  the theory of evolution would instead be reserved for biology class . 
  there you go . 
  that 's one important aspect !, 
  also , by far most people are rational beings . 
  i do n't see children here accepting creationism over evolution theory ( also aimed @ / u/poduszkowiec ) . 
  maybe that 's different in some other countries , but as long as the material is up to standards and the teacher got proper knowledge of the subject , there should be no problem . 
  that 's not how you create critical citizens . 
  in a way , what you are proposing is comparable to only teaching creationist stories . 
  just inform students of both , and let them make their own rational decision after being informed of both . 
  for me , it goes without saying nearly all will flock to the evolution theory as the most plausible theory to explain how humanity came to be . 
  ** edit : ** there appears to be a misunderstanding here . 
  the theory of evolution should be reserved for science class , whereas creationist stories could be talked about in other classes . 
  both would be taught in different classes and clearly distinguished in that way . 
  and yes , i consider creationist stories to be ( obvious ) nonsense , that are easily discarded by critically analyzing it .
