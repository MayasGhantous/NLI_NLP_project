  that was indeed the main reason here , together with significant similarities between right wing parties during rutte i. 
  there were differences of course , especially between the pvv and cda / vvd , but those could be overcome . 
  also , it gave the first real possibility to a right wing coalition in the netherlands , instead of a centre-right one . 
  but it failed , due to the pvv not consenting with further austerity measures - which has now been framed as wilders walking away from his responsibilities as a leader . 
  whether that is just or not is something i 'm really torn about , despite having a severe dislike for the man . 
  you can easily be nationalist , and for example still disagree with 75 % of the viewpoints of the tories . 
  that being : if you were to consider the tories to be a nationalist party here . 
  nationalist persons are n't only situated on the conservative or right wing of the spectrum , even though they tend to mostly clutter there - at least in my experience . 
  you caught my interest , mind expanding on it a bit ? 
  i have also started to doubt capitalism more and more nowadays and consider it to be a hollow experience . 
   40 % of the british electorate disagree with you . 
  actually the lib dems are pretty antinationalist , so thats 48 % of people who disagree . 
  48 % of the british electorate vote on those parties because of a wide range of subjects , and you know just as well as i do that they do not agree to all of them . 
  neither will you when you vote for your own party in italy . 
  you can not deduce that those people are anti-nationalist just because they vote for parties that they consider to be the most fitting to their views . 
  it is dishonest at best , forgive me for saying so . 
  i would be surprised if most people in the uk are n't mindly nationalist to some extent . 
  but there 's a difference between national pride and full fledged nationalism . 
  i think that 's where the misunderstanding is . 
  i think you are more or less advocating for meritocracy , which i also support . 
  i think amateurism and opportunism are ** the ** greatest weaknesses of present day western democracies and will spell the doom for old democracies like the us and e.g. 
  the netherlands in the long run . 
  i do not want to see the western world end as a footnote in history , as happened to the roman republic . 
  over the years my fear has grown that our way of life is threathened in a way unseen before , and protecting it will require strong , knowledgeable and decisive leadership . 
  at some point , we will have to set minimum requirements for prospect holders of public office . 
  there will be a lot of controversy around the measure chosen to do select those people , but it will be necessary in the end . 
  i think i 've lost the rough edges throughout the years , a process that already started a few years before brexit . 
  i 've always identified as right wing in my memory , and still consider myself to be right wing overall , yet have markedly took on a bit more of a leftist or center view on certain topics . 
  i for example no longer believe that people should always save themselves to a ridiculous extent , something which i implictly more or less believed in the past . 
  also , the right wing over here ( the netherlands ) has become significantly more radical throughout the years under the influence of the pvv , which more or less pushed me a bit more to the center . 
  i think i 've gotten more progressive when it comes down to climate change ( something which i always believed by the way , but differed in how it should be approached ) and social issues . 
  in the end i have always remained a conservative-liberal overall though , yet contrarily the liberal streak has in some places also made way for a more conservative view . 
  it really depends on the subject at hand , with me also abandoning more liberal views on direct democracy ( confirmed by brexit , but not created by it ) and far reaching decriminalization of the drug trade . 
  i 've also gotten in favor of things reddit for example really does n't like , e.g. 
  reintroduction of compulsory military service , something which i could n't have possibily imagined in my teenage years . 
  my cynicism towards democracy in its current form has also grown , with me abandoning the naive ideas about it being a near perfect system as i had in my teenage past . 
  i am still positive about it , but have also been disappointed throughout the years . 
  that 's a problem as well , which is why i have a very mixed opinion about upvote/downvote systems , as they can be utilized to enforce whatever the majority * likes * to read , whether that is justified or not . 
  i 'd like to see reddit experiment with removing the downvote button , if only for a ( very ) short while to check what impact it will have . 
  same on / r/europe , minus the topics that deal with immigration . 
  the latter having to do with the subject being really polarized in society , all across europe . 
  overall the mood on / r/europe is good and friendly , and i 've been visiting that place for years by now . 
  this subreddit on the other hand , friendly as it is , seems much more narrow by composition - especially politically . 
  maybe the polarization on / r/europe is therefore for the best : it creates an environment in which different opinions can challenge each other on fundamental points of view , instead of on mere details . 
  the latter is what i mostly see on reddit as a whole . 
  even in that age cohort , the answer is no . 
  reddit got a strong liberal bias overall , thus it is very dangerous to impose whatever reddit thinks on the general population . 
  there are plenty of young people that are n't particularly liberal in their leanings , and those persons are underrepresented on reddit . 
  that , together with disruptive military technology that can end the mad principle on which world peace is based . 
  think of highly advanced lasers that can intercept icbm 's . 
  ` uitkeringstrekker ' ( more or less literally translated to ` welfare profiteer ' ) is a more general piece of terminology to refer to such people . 
  although ` tokkie ' ( also synonymous to scum/white trash ) might as well apply in quite a few situations . 
  not in all though . 
  america : the country known as the usa , as well as a name for a continent that is divided in a southern and northern half . 
  american : inhabitant of the usa , not an inhabitant of the continent weird enough . 
  it is a bit of double standard : i refer to people from europe as europeans , people from asia as asians , yet do not refer to people from the american continent ( s ) as americans . 
  south-americans maybe , but that 's about it . 
   i 'm downvoting because telling me `` just go challenge your opinion on other subs '' is not answering the question i asked , not because it 's not the answer i want . 
  because some people - including me - want to call you out on the question itself . 
  that 's part of asking a question : a question can be stupid ( if only for a moment ) , and others are entitled to draw its merits into doubt . 
   i do enough of reading different opinions and debating as it is . 
  do you really ? 
  if so , why are you still deadset on finding a place that looks upon things from a narrow perspective ? 
  this seems a bit contradictory with the notion of you taking account of different opinions . 
  or is that unfair ? 
   so next time you do n't have the answer , either do n't reply or accept the legitimate downvotes without complaining , or is that too much differing opinion for you to handle and i should direct you to the nearest echo-chamber ? 
  well i can handle it , easily to be honest . 
  the fact that you 're taking on a passive aggressive tone * suggests * the opposite though . 
  at least , that 's how this comes across . 
  i will add that i answered via the reddit phone app . 
  normally i read the comments , but in this case i did n't . 
  seems like others had the same idea though . 
  sorry to say so , but you might as well have titled this post as `` lf echo chamber to join '' . 
  you contrarily should look up places with other opinions and challenge those . 
  ** edit ** : amazing how you come here to ask a question , yet downvote all criticism against the notion of joining subs where you 're surrounded with likeminded people . 
  for me , this is where hypocrisy begins - and its a dangerous attitude . 
  if you only surround yourself with likeminded people this will impede the development of a proper and balanced world view . 
  i 'd suggest you take that advice to heart , instead of moping `` i seem to have come to the wrong place to ask '' . 
  we have different impressions it seems . 
  they 're just like dutch flags : uncommon , to the point of being just rare . 
  we have yet to see whether britain actually leaves when it gets presented a bad deal . 
  a referendum of confirmation is far from an impossible option at this point . 
  also , article 50 is a rather recent invention , one with far reaching consequences once completed after having been activated . 
  not over here , and i doubt in the entirety of europe . 
  it 's rather weird to devolve the left-right dichotomy into progressive vs conservative * while at the same time * making ` right wing ' analogous to ` extreme right/alt right ' . 
  from my point of view that does n't make sense - at all , and i doubt i 'm the only one at that . 
  does that make left wing ` extreme left/radical left ' as well ? 
  it 's a weird interpretation at best . 
   and yes i would say `` right wing '' is ** mainly associated ** with nsdap and alike . 
  wow , is this really a thing in germany ? 
  that does n't sound healthy , at all . 
  there 's a rather obvious difference between your normal , run of the mill right wing party versus right wing extremists/alt rightists . 
  85 % win chance , not votes . 
  that 's something entirely different . 
  i never encountered it on / r/europe , but well , / r/worldnews is some other place altogether . 
  i 'd expect that kind of stuff there , but on / r/europe people are more reacting along the lines of ` this is an interesting development ' or ` merkel should watch out ' . 
  that has n't exactly been my experience on reddit , despite some cheering for far right groups it seems . 
  where did you encounter this sentiment if i may ask ? 
  ** edit : ** downvotes for asking a few questions , and doubting some other sentiments expressed here . 
  please open up your mind people , and be accepting to other opinions .
