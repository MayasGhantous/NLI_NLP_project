  how many years of downturn do you want the eurozone to have ? 
  yes , germany , the netherlands and austria are doing okay danke and can wait a good few more years to see how well austerity works . 
  but what about spain , greece and portugal ? 
  difficult to say : this depends - out of virtue of the current political system - on the will of the countries you 're talking about . 
  let 's add italy to that list as well . 
  as long as those 4 can not get their shit together in the coming 3 to 5 years or so , a change in strategy * might be considered an option * . 
  not now : we are still dealing with the after effects of the latest crisis . 
  but the markets seem to be moving all of a sudden , so lets see where this takes us . 
  sure , that i am not fighting against . 
  indeed : the short and mid term results of the policies carried out in the usa for example have been pretty effective . 
  question is if it will help the usa in the long run . 
  by the way : i am not saying they do n't have it right by definition , i 'm just saying that it is n't ` obvious ' at this point yet . 
  nothing is final . 
  damn , that must be the german in me calling out . 
  [ clickbait for britons ] ( http://country-balls.com/britains-nightmare/ ) . 
  this pretty much illustrates the current situation for britain :, 
  as you know the current downturn is not limited to europe alone : apparantly the us did n't have it ` right ' after all as well . 
  the methods of neither party have by now be proven useful and only time will tell who took the wrong decision . 
  what i do loathe is this ` obviousness ineffectiveness ' that some of you - mainly americans and britons - seem to preach regarding austerity measures . 
  we just can not know yet . 
  cnn reporting a doomsday message , how exceptional . 
  be fearful people , be fearful . 
  `` desert 's angels '', 
  quite the contrary : the soviet union was already showing signs of a possible demise as early as 1985 , at least in its present form at that time . 
  the same is not the case here : there is a new system in place , a system that is still very much alive and kicking . 
  so far , there is no indication that imminent disaster will strike down putin his administration . 
  i wonder where this will lead to . 
  if reconciliation is not considered as an option , future violence in the balkans will again become a realistic option . 
  which brings me to the following : what will putin actually bring with him to belgrade ? 
  i hope that russian soldiers will not be following in his wake , ready to destabilize the fragile situation in the region . 
  reforming and becoming part of the eu in the distant future is a more stable prospect . 
  what you are saying might very well be possible , but that slim possibility completely hinges on the power oligarchs can exert on putin and his entourage . 
  as we have seen , a few rebellious oligarchs are no problem for putin . 
  in order for this to work , there needs to be widespread planning for a coup d'etat , as putin will not likely bend for some internal soft power . 
  as i said before : the grip of the current political class on russia is very strong at this point . 
  it will be hard to make plans to get rid of putin and his friends without anyone finding out about it . 
  but maybe i overestimate putin his power . 
  do you really believe that oligarchs can simply exert enough power to get him out ? 
  even by using the regular channels ? 
  it will in the long term , but for now it will buy them time . 
  western companies have been too greedy over the past years and have invested way too much in russia . 
  they should sell their assets and get out as soon as possible , if that is still an option at this point . 
  if not , making vital production plants or equipment inoperable in the face of legal theft might be an option as well . 
  call it economic scorched earth tactics , but it would be justified . 
  some examples of western businesses tied up into russia : http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/business/international/western-businesses-in-russia-are-watchful-and-wary.html?_r=0, 
  that 's the pickle : the russian people will sadly suffer because of the mistakes of their political class , but it is not likely that putin would be ousted by some kind of equally glorious revolutionary movement . 
  the kremlin its hold on the nation is very strong at this point , if not close to unbreakable . 
  if you explicitly or implicity threat your own people with the most vile of punishments , it will in the end break their will . 
  the present day system has already succeeded in killing future opposition in varying degrees . 
  whatever is left will likely not be able to get the current clique out without military support . 
  military support that will also not be likely . 
  well , apparantly i have this invane hope that people actually would learn from the past in a shorter timeframe nowadays . 
  but indeed : what can one expect if there is so little attention to reconciliation . 
  i would have really had ** no problem ** embracing a german in the aftermath of wwii , knowing that both sides always lose in war . 
  people should get past their differences , how difficult or ` not-done ' that might be . 
  so much is wrong with this comment :  but giving paramilitary groups ... where did you read this ? 
  the individuals in question do n't have any paramilitary status , nor do they behave as such in our society . 
   in the hands of ( probable ) criminals ... also , this assumption is really over the line . 
  it is true : * some large * biker organisations/gangs are associated with organised crime , but that surely is not by default the case for every individual member . 
  someone is innocent until proven otherwise and the same applies to this very situation . 
   you 've just given biker gang permission to commit and crime under the sun without the realistic expactation of prosecution . 
  i would n't be so sure about this . 
  to get one thing clear : these guys have not been given carte blanche . 
  the same rules apply to them as to any combatant in any given conflict . 
  also , the hague is host to multiple international courts , one of them being the icc . 
  now , the icc would n't have jurisdiction in this matter , but i 'm saying this to once again underline that we respect international law more than most western nations out there . 
  if some dutch person commits attrocities in iraq or syria , he will be prosecuted . 
  if not now , then in 10 years . 
  see also the case of frans van anraat . 
  completely wrong assumption . 
  no one , and really no one here , ** `` sent '' ** these guys . 
  they left out of their own personal convictions . 
  there is no elaborate government plot to send out biker organisations . 
  a very suggestive title , which gives the illusion that dozens of dutch biker gangs have taken off to iraq/syria in order to root out the scurge of isil . 
  nothing is less true : only a few bikers have left , and at the same time they have taken a decision that is not punishable according to our laws . 
  the article is pretty clear about that : there 's a difference against fighting the people that want to take up arms against the netherlands instead of joining them . 
  about the implicit assumption of double standards : this is not the case , given that the outcome in both cases will be legally completely different . 
  finally i would also like to point out that much more dutch kurds have left the netherlands to fight the scourge of isil , something that has clearly been stated as legal by the dutch public prosecutor . 
  i do n't want to oversimplify it too much , but to say that it got a lot to do with runaway nationalism does at least summarize the core problem a bit i take it ? 
  it amazes me that after all these years , there is still much strife among these nations . 
  the obvious counter argument would be that past conflicts are still pretty recent , but that just does n't cut if anymore in 2014 . 
  but moreover : what the fuck is up with this hooligan behavior during matches in serbia . 
  why does football has to be so often associated with violence over there ? 
  disclaimer : i 'm not referring to serbia nor albania as the culprits . 
  i know , it is really sad . 
  it is true that one has to be wary around here if you have a dissenting opinion . 
  i said nothing unreasonable here , yet i got mass downvoted . 
  you are right , and do have to apologize for that grave error . 
  seemingly , i mixed problem solving genes up with critical thinking , which in itself is more of a abstract concept . 
  i triple checked for sources for it , but i can find none ( at least none scientific ) . 
  i withdraw my earlier statement on the genetic part : thanks for correcting me . 
  the bottom line being : never try to catch the bottom  ? 
  i read it obviously , but i 'm talking about the title . 
  i do n't like the impression it gives at first sight . 
  we are still * far removed * from that . 
  and honestly , i do n't think the ecb would be unhappy with a cheap euro that can give a boost to exporting . 
   i really dont know how he has managed to fuck it all up so badly . 
  forgive me for the oversimplicification of reality , but i believe that the poison of nationalism will be a good starting point for explaining this . 
  also , on a different note , i wonder if all the purges done by stalin and years of communist indoctrination have actually had an effect on the genetics of russians . 
  critical thinking * is * at least partially related to certain genes , and those genes might have well proven a major handicap for certain people during past purges .
