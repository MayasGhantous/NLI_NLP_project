  i really wonder if the type of person you are referring to can be found in large numbers within the confines of this subreddit . 
  not every reddit user is the same as you know , so please let us not just throw r/worldnews for example on the same pile as r/europe . 
  maybe you 're right about this subreddit in particular , but i 'm not so sure . 
  the people i would really like to argue with , but that are an exotic minority among the anti-nuclear movement , are the ones that only focus on nuclear waste instead of safety . 
  nuclear waste still is a major problem , but one that could be overcome . 
  the methods how however can be subject to a good , decent discussion . 
  but i wo n't hide the fact ( hence my tone elsewhere in this topic ) that i find it fruitless to argue with people that ca n't get any further than : * ` nuclear energy is bad ... hmkay ... . you should n't build reactors , because radiation ... hmkay ... and chernobyl and shit . . ' *, 
  you might even be right . 
  and politicians played right into it , germany being in front of this reverse revolution . 
  this type of waging politics gets awkwardly close to what we call clientelism but then again , i heard that is pretty much how merkel for example keeps popular support up . 
  just bend with the crowd and everything will be alright . 
  no vision , no spine , nothing . 
  unfit as a leader if you ask me . 
  any ship ( of state that is ) will hit the rocks without a captain at the helm . 
   it di n't happen not because a tsunami it pretty much did . 
  a massive tsunami that for some reason was n't taken into account when building the reactor . 
  a major design flaw that is everything but related to nuclear power plant safety . 
  about time . 
  i was so extremely disappointed with the stance of european politicians in the aftermath of the fukushima daiichi disaster . 
  suddenly , a very doomsday like message was put forward regarding nuclear energy and to this day i believe this was a coordinated effort , fueled by fundamentalists of organisations like greenpeace and their naive partners . 
  conveniently , they forgot to mention that a design flaw did n't make nuclear energy less safe . 
  a serious design flaw that is , given japan 's location in a seismically very active area . 
  what shocked me even more was the position of germany , and how easily angela merkel bent for some outdated ideas among the general populace . 
  suddenly , every nuclear reactor was labeled a potential chernobyl , a disaster waiting to happen . 
  the same madness took hold of japan - though more understable - but at least in japan politicians have seen the light as some nuclear power plants have been restarted again . 
  the newest generation nuclear power plants are much safer , and much more effici\u00ebnt , then the older ones . 
  i wonder why there is so little talk about generation iii , and more important , generation iv reactors . 
  some generation iv designs even are inherently safe ( for example : the molten salt reactor ) and can not wreak havoc on the surroundings whenever things would go wrong ( how extremely slim that change even might be ) . 
  what we do know is that energy consumption has been on the rise for a long time , and a few wind turbines - in contrast to what some treehuggers might believe - will not balance out the energy shortage that is looming past the horizon . 
  build - more - reactors . 
  ** let rationality prevail over idiotic idealism ** . 
  about the tax part : i do n't know how it is arranged over there in finland , but something tells me that eu politicians are exempted from taxation just as is the case here . 
  if they are n't taxed , that $ 7.665 is a very nice salary , given that only 12 % in ` taxes ' is paid to their employer , that being the eu . 
  edit : it is a bit more , but still not really close to national standards . 
  what did guy verhofstadt ask again ? 
  ah yes : $ 12.500 for one single speech http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/home/kandidaat-voorzitter-ec-klust-voor-tonnen-bij ( dutch source ) . 
  though , as asenk pointed out , it is n't all that bad . 
  the us senate remains by far the worst example in the western world when it comes down to the division of wealth between the ruling class and ordinary citizens . 
  well , you are free to call that a dish . 
  i just consider it a sausage thrown on a plate filled with vegetables and mashed potatoes . 
  not extremely tasty as well , unless you 're one of those salt lovers . 
  good call . 
  we best march into syria supported by that wisdom . 
  well ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomenklatura, 
  ouch . 
  if only we * had * a decent national cuisine . 
  but no , we 're stuck with extremely salty herring and bitterballen . 
  it says something about how underdeveloped good taste is down here . 
  we could learn a lot from the italians and french in that regard . 
  i 'm saying that it is rather impossible to say what * would have happened * if antwerp was n't - as pointed out above - twarthed by the netherlands in history . 
  apparantly some people here reason that it ** must ** be so that flanders today would be much more wealthy , while disregarding all the other variables into play . 
  it is just wrong reasoning to assume by default that present day flanders would be more wealthy by simply basing such an opinion on ` ifs ' . 
  you can not know for certain . 
   do n't be naive , holland knew exactly what it was doing throughout the centuries . 
  a lot of actions were taken to promote rotterdam over antwerp as the main european harbor . 
  and that does reflect in the present day economy . 
  i 'll take your word on it then , and wo n't ask for any evidence to back this up . 
  what you seem to forget however is where the schelde is positioned in the world , and that we basically owe nothing to the port of antwerp if - and only if - we would forget about our mutual relationships . 
  the schelde has been dutch territory for a long time already and you ca n't impose a claim upon the dutch government because of some alledged historical wrongdoing . 
  that might sound rough , but that is what it basically boils down to if you forget about politics . 
  though i will give you this : the position of antwerp was unfortunate . 
  it flourished for a long time , but the strategical weakness called the schelde had to come up once . 
  that does n't reflect in the present day economy of flanders though . 
  that is why i consider such arguments of the past to be less relevant , if not irrelevant . 
  the present day discussion regarding the schelde does n't revolve around blockades from ages past . 
  the obvious solution would 've been building a port in the western part of belgium , directly bordering the north sea . 
  but apparantly that was n't considered an option over the past say ... 400 years . 
  that might be so , but in the meanwhile - and we 're talking about a timespan of about 150 years - flanders had more than enough time to change its own economy . 
  the simple fact that there 's an important port behind the schelde ( i.e. 
  the port of antwerp ) does not infringe the territorial sovereignty of the netherlands * with respect to * the schelde . 
  of course , being a good neighbour dictates that you work together to solve such issues . 
  and as i said below : this has yet happened by the signing of the schelde treaty . 
  i believe flanders got its fair share of cooperation from this side of the border . 
  mind you that we might as well could have build a dam there . 
  ehm , this ended somewhere in the second half of the 19th century so how is this exactly relevant today ? 
  you know , in 2014 . 
  a few centuries ? 
  is n't the entire discussion about the schelde more a recent fenomenon ? 
  and to be frank : the netherlands and belgium made some arrangements regarding the schelde . 
  you can look that up in the schelde treaty . 
  there was some fuss about it , but it will be implemented if it has n't been implemented yet that is . 
  it is more than that : this is just some kind of awkward conspiracy theory , probably born in some rural location . 
  he 's basically saying that native dutch will be pushed aside by oh-so-feared immigrants . 
  political stereotypes . 
  every theory that tries to catch political allegiance in 2 dimensions is self-defeating . 
  there are many schools of thought in society with differing influences and i therefore try to prevent using such oversimplifications . 
  power politics at play here . 
  it is highly unlikely that this has nothing to do what is happening in europe at the moment , also given the fact that there seems be a pattern of ` incidents ' now . 
  russia seems to be testing the resolve of eu member states . 
  political correctness is not limited to immigration . 
  at least , that 's how i can explain your comment about immigration , to which i was n't referring in particular . 
  political correctness is an umbrella term for a certain type of political attitude . 
  good to hear that but i wonder if the policies born out of 9/11 will ever be reversed . 
  do n't get me wrong here , but i have always seen the patriot act as a victory for al qaida and other terrorist organisations . 
  it significantly limited civil rights , and was self-defeating for the usa , as it would 've been self-defeating for any western nation . 
  i hope you will be able to get rid of such acts in the future , even in a situation where certain groups are still hostile to the usa . 
  who the hell downvoted this ? 
  sometimes i really do n't get the people here on reddit . 
  it feeds my belief that downvoting should be curtailed somehow . 
  given how political correctness used to rule the pre-2000 's dutch political landscape , you can hardly call any government before 2000 something else than left or centre .
