  they are the bigots here reallyfastcloud , not me . 
  let is - and any extremist organisation - die an agonizing death for the benefit of mankind . 
  it got everything to do with it . 
  ex-soviet states that - voluntarily - turn towards the eu and , once again , * voluntarily * accept the eu 's supremacy in certain matters are still very much sovereign states . 
  entering the eu is a decision born out of sovereignty because there is no pressure . 
  russia on the other hand is acting like a suzerain and uses the language of threat and force to move a certain entity into its direction . 
  next to that , pretty much everything what the people below said . 
  that really is a bad assumption to make , and above all untrue . 
  do n't create the illusion of double standards when they are n't there . 
  for what it is worth : i always downvote this kind of framing . 
  one word : ** sovereignty ** . 
  thanks for this . 
  it 's shocking to see how easy some of us lose our superior values whenever emotions come into play . 
  i see this kind of reasoning a lot , and it is very contradictory in nature . 
  of course you can say : i 've met many wonderful people in my life that happened to be muslim . 
  that 's cool , so have i. 
  problem is that the ` extremists ' you talk about ** identify ** with islam . 
  there is no doubt about that , yet by some reason non-muslims believe they can claim that extremists are n't muslims just because they adhere to some radical interpretation of islam . 
  that in itself smells like double standards , probably because of political and social reasons . 
  i will never deny that islam , of all the mainstream religions , is much more prone to be interpreted in an extremist fashion , even though the amount of extremists is very slim . 
  but to say that for example radicalism among muslim youth has nothing to do with islam is just plain wrong . 
  though i very much admit that cultural ( and more important : social-economic factors ) play an important role as well . 
  none so far , not even the slightest . 
  this is just guessing and drawing conclusions without even the smallest bit of evidence . 
  you can best ignore this . 
  i admit that there is a problem with islam , but the example you named could n't more wrong . 
  the guy that killed another 15 year old was apparantly a ` loner ' that was systematically bullied . 
  that of course * does not * make the other guy fair game , and the perpetrator should be punished . 
  but i 'm just saying that - basically - a bully was killed by one of his victims . 
  completely different situation . 
  apparantly the killer was also a ` gothic ' , so i do n't really believe that he even slighty cared about islam . 
  because of the holy mother church that still pulls some strings over there . 
  indeed , norway was one year earlier apparantly . 
  weird that i mixed up the numbers on this one . 
  well to place it in a context for you : the kind of union estonia just introduced was actually first introduced by ... the netherlands . 
  somewhere around 1996 i believe , and it is seen as the preliminary phase towards gay marriage all over the world . 
  so i guess it 's some kind of ` victory ' in that regard . 
  you are denying reality if you claim that ` gay rights ' have not been expanded by this law . 
  and please , do n't take haters that adhere to the right of the strongest in protection . 
  they do n't deserve it . 
  alright , alright , i 'll buy your cabernet sauvignon . 
  jeez . 
  it 's also interesting to see how complaining by the plebs seems to be a universal trend in about every civilized country . 
  yet they keep complaining about their rulers while they at the same time immediatly show their own incompetence by actions like that  . 
  no platinum ? 
  you disappoint me . 
  of course not , as that would require critical reading and a sense of reflection . 
  the plebs do not possess such skills . 
  iceland and heat , of course . 
  the title is a bit unfortunate , but for me it 's clear they are referring to the ` heated ' debate that preceded this new act . 
  trust me that it is in this case . 
  it might not be * this * terrible everywhere , but in general the belgian road network is way below average , if not downright bad . 
  for us the border really means crossing into another world . 
  said by a person that lives very close to the belgian-dutch border . 
  at least your asphalt concrete does n't melt during extreme heat ( ours does ) , nor does it tend to crack as much during extreme cold . 
  edit : apparantly asfalt concrete performs worse during winter . 
  i do wonder why i so often read about such stories then . 
  maybe resentful students that could n't quite succeed at university ? 
  funny though - and contradictory - that the us is seemingly so ... socialist ( pun intended ) when it comes down to supporting students . 
  my image of the entire us higher education system has been shattered . 
  thanks for that , though i believe that the system still is n't preferable compared to what we have over here , but to say it 's * completely * unfair ... no . 
  you guys pretty much convinced me of that . 
  i 'll spread the word . 
  i understand that , but i 'm focussing on universities and especially the more prestigious ones . 
  the possibility to achieve your dreams gets kind of curtailed by lack of access to high ranked universities . 
  but you 're right that it is n't all sky high . 
  take for example stanford : https://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/registrar/students/tuition-fees_13-14 . 
  still a * lot * of money for one mere year of college , and hardly affordable on your own without lending money or applying for scholarschips , but in the end do-able . 
  of course , it always works both ways . 
  whatever we created is n't perfect as well and that 's a good thing . 
  i read it all the way through to the bottom . 
  the xenophobia part is n't really unknown to me : there has been more than just incidental media upheaval about growing xenophobia in italy . 
  having some italian roots myself , i noticed firsthand ( in my own family and on holidays ) how prevalent racism and discrimination is among italians . 
  which kinda strikes me for one of the most catholic , if not * the most * catholic nation , on the world . 
  it 's a kind of hypocrisy that i never really could explain . 
  i 'm no christian ( not anymore at least ) , but the entire notion of discrimination just goes against the teachings of ` god ' . 
  but if it is as you say , and populism is the driving force behind the entire ` northern italy independence ' - movement , then it is best to prevent it all cost . 
  sadly , italy is still dealing with a gerontocatic political system and the old guard really needs to make way for younger people . 
  without them out of the way , incompetent politicians will keep flooding in . 
  were you spanish also that cynical before the entire economic downturn ? 
  i sometimes wonder . 
  thanks for your reply , i appreciate it !, 
  it seems to be a fairly ( maybe needlessly ? ), 
  complex system , though i do understand the motivations behind all of it . 
  it basically boils down to motivation and performance : as long as you keep your standards high enough , it is possible to significantly reduce the cost of studying . 
  then again , if you are the unlucky guy that scores mediocre grades , what will happen ? 
  will you be forced to pay back your scholarschip , or is this only the case whenever one fails his/her entire study ? 
  though indeed it is n't all doom and gloom as you said before . 
  the costs are still high compared to here ( i believe still being obliged to pay somewhere close to 10.000 dollars a year is likely more of a rule than an exception if you study at a decent university ) , but the costs are n't astronomical as well . 
  as for the borrowing of money part ( or should i say , loansharking with regard to private loans ^ ^ ) : over here you are allowed to lend about 25.000 euro 's from the government over a period of 3 years . 
  you are n't obliged to pay it back during your study , nor will you be obligated to pay any interest . 
  after finishing whatever you started , you 'll end up paying 1,5 % interest a year , next to paying back the money you borrowed . 
  and for that you have like 10 or 15 years . 
  the european social model vs the american dream . 
  always interesting to notice the differences . 
  once again thanks for adding to my knowledge . 
  alright then , thanks for adding to my knowledge . 
  now you are at it : what is the scholarschip system like over there ? 
  could you draw me a general picture ? 
  ` the land of opportunity ' , right ?
