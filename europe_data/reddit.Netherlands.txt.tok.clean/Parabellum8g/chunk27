  thank god that we started talking about these problems for the first time like ... 10 years ago ? 
  because only after that did politicians open their eyes , after having seen their * dreamworld * multicultural society being smashed into pieces by reality . 
  arab , is n't that a complete misnomer as well ? 
  given the facts , german-iranian or iranian-german ( whatever sequence you want to put it ) is more in place . 
  i 'd say german-iranian , as that 's the place where hiddak spends his time . 
  or just simply german if that 's his wish . 
  i do n't know if i 'm maintaining some high moral standards here , but i kinda see ` arab ' as offensive here . 
  do n't want to sound overly correct though . 
  this happens here like a few times a year . 
  the dutch airforce will escort the bastards across ** our ** airspace , before the british raf takes over to ensure that the russians will safely breach their airspace . 
  it is this kind of cowardice that has really set the tone for europe 's relations with russia over the past few years . 
  i have no objections against shooting a few warning rounds at russian bombers whenever they violate our own airspace . 
  because i damn well know what would happen if nato f16 's would cross over into russian airspace . 
  interesting story . 
  what you say almost complete applies to the status of muslims in the netherlands as well . 
  everyone can make the best of their life , given the fact that the government will provide them with the tools to do so . 
  and i believe germany and the netherlands are far from exceptions with respect to other european nations . 
  as for the situation over here : a major influence in the fact that muslims as group - though i 'd rather not speak of a group in this regard - are being left behind a bit is also the fact they tend to strongly identify as being part of a group . 
  this has resulted in all kinds of awkwardness , including forming an own parallel community within society . 
  things like mastery of the native language and integration within society have been partially thwarted because of this . 
  though there have been more factors , including the failure of national governments all across europe to adress even the most basic of problems . 
  but i have named this one in particular as there is n't enough attention to this problem anywhere in europe . 
  i also immediatly recognize the urge to blame other non-muslims for a racist attitude . 
  first of all , racism of course is the ** wrong word ** to describe it . 
  muslims do n't belong to a race , but rather to a certain religious faith to which they identify . 
  so if we 're talking about any alleged bad treatment , we should be talking about the scourge of discrimination . 
  what next to that catches my eye is that you - even though you identify as being agnostic - still identify as being a muslim . 
  of course that 's part of being agnostic ( since you do n't know what to pick ) but still it 's a kind of contradiction . 
  though you 're completely free to do that . 
  i believe you missed my point . 
  by saying that , i have implied that collective responsibility - flawed as it is - will be imposed regardless of what we say here . 
  there will always be factions within a society that tends to think of other people as belonging to a wider ` group ' . 
  and to be honest : that is n't always wrong . 
  we could just happily ignore the fact that the people that commit these atrocities cleary identify with islam , but i 'm sure that will actually make the problem worse . 
  there 's nothing wrong with admitting that islam is more prone to be interpreted in a radical fashion , compared with other mainstream religions . 
  what we should n't do in the process of combating this , is creating this image that all muslims might adhere to the same terrible standards . 
  something that is obviously a complete lie . 
  also , saying that collective responsibility is nonsense gets very close to this flawed idea we have in the western world , namely that the ` individual ' makes all of his own decisions . 
  muslims just as well look at each other for inspiration and they sure as hell identify as a group , though fragmented through different denominations . 
  could i ? 
  to add to the top comment : we need much more of this . 
  this alone is a very good sign , but it is far from enough . 
  i never really got why so many muslims just lift their shoulders whenever someone - that identifies as one of them - commits terrible attrocities in the name of allah . 
  personally , i 'd do everything to just * prevent * being identified with such people . 
  i hope that we 'll see more of these kinds of protests , for the sake of all involved . 
  how much influence does the ` federal ' movement have in the european parliament as of present ? 
  pretty much part of the trend we 're seeing all over europe nowadays . 
  then again , all over europe some parties that ca n't really be called far-right or extreme right are being labeled as such . 
  this article really breathes bigotry . 
  once again , the eu must be characterised as slow/inefficient/bureaucratic , while the author just ignores the fact that the usa itself does n't know what to exactly do with putin . 
  as if congress always immediatly closes ranks whenever something is up in the world . 
  well , to call it imaginary might be a bit of an understatement . 
  of course : the chances that something in europe might happen are very slim at best , but i have no objection about legally opposing the people that dream of such barbarity . 
  it is just another signal that such behavior - i.e. 
  supporting isil - is not allowed in our enlightened part of the world . 
  intolerance breeds intolerance , and there 's no reason for tolerant people to be tolerant towards intolerance . 
  you do understand the catalonian independence movement has been there for a long , long time right ? 
  then there 's the massive cultural differences between the rest of spain and catalonia , so one could argue that the right of self determination pretty much allows catalonia to break away from spain . 
  of course , i do n't like that trend in an ever globalizing world , but in the end it wo n't matter . 
  i 'm referring to the plan put forward by president sarkozy back then , though i 'm not sure if sarkozy wanted to frame his plans within the boundaries of the common security and defense policy . 
  a real ` european army ' ( i.e. 
  european armed forces acting under the responsibility of european institutions ) would have to come into existence using the provisions made in the lisbon treaty , namely article 42-2 , that deals with this topic . 
  so to answer your question , by eu army i 'm referring to any armed forces entity that can truly step in place of national armies . 
  a goal that seemed to be still far away previous year , but might have come just that much closer given the situation on the eastern outskirts of europe . 
  it was . 
  the telegraaf was actually outlawed for ( i believe ) 4 years after the end of the second world war . 
  the rhetoric i encounter nowadays is really disturbing at times , though i will call it far from fascist or something like that in tone . 
  but the quality of the telegraaf - the most read newspaper in the netherlands - has really degraded to downright bad . 
  even the ` serious ' part of the newspaper - that is the part in front of the thick ` gossip/glamour ' nonsense - has become more sensational over the past few years . 
  proper journalistic standards are no longer adhered to if you ask me . 
  i believe the absolute low was the telegraaf - in a veiled way - preparing its readers for war after the mh17 incident . 
  given the circumstances , now is the best of any time . 
  something i can only agree to . 
  well from what i have understood the tory 's seem to have a rather limited view on what europe should actually be , which is fine of course ( they are completely entitled to that ) . 
  not to mention ukip , which got a rather extreme view compared to the conservatives . 
  but some of the more ` popular newspapers ' , whose audiences likely reach many of the conservative/ukip supporters seem to campaign their anti-eu message in quite the same manner . 
  that 's what i 've noticed at least over the past few months , and i do read british newspapers more than occassionally . 
  it 's because of that i wonder if there indeed is some effort by some organised political front going on behind the scenes . 
  did n't the uk have a history of sorts when it comes down to the relationship between the press and british politics ? 
  must i by reading this conclude that you assume that my opinion is limited to thinking that there 's like one group with one opinion on the eu in the uk ? 
  if so , please explain how you managed to reach that conclusion . 
  do n't take it too seriously iscin . 
  it 's not like i have this image of 99 percent of all british voters wanting to leave the eu . 
  reality - as it always turns out to be - is more complicated than that . 
  but i will use the personal privileges every person has ( in regard to having my own opinion ) , and therefore i ** consider ** the option that it ** might ** be in the uk 's best interest to leave . 
  might . 
  it does n't need to be like that , but i do n't expect that the political sentiment in the uk will turn anytime soon . 
  do we really have a shared sense of humour ? 
  most british guys i 've spoken to seem to be more cynical than their counterparts on the other side of the north sea . 
  but honestly now , fill me in on the current sentiment in the uk . 
  add to my knowledge . 
  fair enough . 
  we have a similar rag like that down here , only we call it ` de telegraaf ' . 
  guess what that means translated . 
  sure , but that does n't mean that their views on europe are the same , just because france and the uk have some good bilateral relationships . 
  that part about the media in the uk i 've noticed as well . 
  it must be a real hardship to open a newspaper and once again be confronted with some sensational anti-eu message , all for the good of the people of course . 
  i sometimes wonder how strong the ties between british politics and the british press still are . 
  i tend to guess that those bonds are very strong , given how much of a coordinated effort there seems to be against the eu for example . 
  about the opt out thing : sure , that was an example of me using a hyperbole , but during the negotiation of important treaties the united kingdom tends to take a very isolated stance , as it has done so on multiple occassions .
