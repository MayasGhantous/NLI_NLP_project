  interesting . 
  i was about the make the same comment as / u/drstins _ n , but apparantly 150 km/h has gone out of the window . 
  i am curious about those stats : where did you get them from ? 
  also , when was the poll taken ? 
  ( i take it the data are the result from a poll ) . 
  edit : nevermind , got it already . 
  also in the far left , just for accuracy 's sake . 
  too bad ` the people ' are sensitive to such ideas . 
  i 'm completely ok with all these people protesting of course , but i do have a problem with this :  `` the problem is n't renzi , renzi is a pawn , renzi is a dumb slave , at the disposal of some nameless person who wants to control all our lives from brussels , '' this idea that there is some kind of ` invisible enemy ' smells too much like a conspiracy theory to me . 
  similar tactics have been used in the past , but i 'd prefer that such rhetorical trics stay in the past and out of the present . 
  they 'll get the memo sooner or later . 
  i expect that the swedish will draw the same conclusion as other european nations that have enabled mass immigration : that being that there factually is no real multicultural society , but mostly division . 
  as much as the clash of civilisations has been discredited i am noticing it everywhere . 
  maybe huntington was right . 
  the one where sven kramer missed the 10km title during the winter olympics because of a wrong turn . 
  it was a major victory of karma vs unsporty persons . 
  i figure a lot of belgian people ask themselves that question on a daily basis . 
   is it , at all , possible in your narrow worldview that not everything putin does is disagreeable , evil or wrong ? 
  in fact , it may just be that putin , like most every person that 's ever lived , holds some opinions that people might agree with while at the same time ( gasp ) disagreeing with other positions of his !, 
  you might even find that hitler and stalin enjoyed things or kept values close to your own on certain subjects , and that 's okay . 
  just because someone you do n't like does a , does n't mean you have to hate a. 
  what a terrible strawman argument and above all a needless waste of words . 
  of course i do not think putin is the reincarnation of adolf hitler . 
  i am quite sure he does n't eat babies for breakfast , yet his policies are very questionable . 
  in short , if i summarize your opinion correctly , you imply that putin his opinion is to be taken seriously and could be used as guidance for european states , including the netherlands . 
  i consider that worrying for good reason : we are talking about the man that has unleashed multiple wars in his career which directly involved russia - and those wars were clearly wars of aggression . 
  next to that , he is the leader of a country so corrupt that both us ca n't even properly realize according to dutch standards , yet this man his council - including his tu quoque habit which you quoted - is not to be taken seriously by any advanced country in the west . 
  if i 'd had to pick between the west or russia the decision would be made almost instantly : even the fact that we are flawed as well , does * not mean * that we are * more * flawed than russia . 
  we are most certainly not !, 
  do not turn to putin to show us ` the way ' . 
  you are probably disappointed in politicians here - highly disappointed - and so am i. 
  but to take the word of a leader of a highly corrupt nation that engages in very questionable politics seriously is just crossing the line . 
  all the time supportive ? 
  surprisingly more than you 'd suspect ? 
  yes . 
  and do n't you worry : i 've read that place on a daily basis for years before it devolved into what it has become nowadays , that being a highly immature tabloid like source of ` information ' . 
  i know that feeling all too well by now and instantly recognize your frustration about it . 
  if you read the comments on geenstijl you will often find remarks to famous conspiracy theories , including the nwo one and of course the rothschild doomsday theory . 
  probably the quality of the comment section , though not as bad as the telegraaf , is the reason why i do n't read that weblog anymore . 
  most of the people commenting there have completely closed their minds to solutions beside the ones they think off . 
  i ca n't imagine reading the comments on that site day in day out and not being in a permanent asinine mood because of it  . 
  it is ? 
  last time i checked the dutch parliament created the law that enabled referendums of this kind . 
  could you expand on why you think the eu made this referendum possible ? 
   we the people, 
  in exactly one article ( [ this one ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2014/07/mh17terroristen_houden_knuffel.html ) ) , that happened to be directly connected to mh17 . 
  next to that geenstijl seems to be somewhere down the middle on average when it comes down to putin . 
  what i ask myself is how you * can * be down there somewhere knowing what this guy has done so far and what he might pull in the future . 
  sure : the western world is not perfect - and certainly not europe - but to make some sort of aggregated claim that both are more or less equally terrible is just too much for me . 
  geenstijl has also had a habit of being not very critical towards putin , sometimes being even downright supportive . 
  do n't expect some kind of nuance from that entity , as it is incapable of it ( unless it suits geenstijl itself ) . 
  their own slogan is * ` tendentious , unsubstantiated and needlessly insulting ' * . 
  it 's the perfect escape whenever geenstijl has worked itself in a corner : you can just say it was all for fun and giggles and act like nothing happened , only to ask to be taken seriously the day after in some other topic . 
  ** edit ** : lol , some are actually calling to brigade this place in the comments [ here ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2015/09/yes_we_could.html#comments ) . 
  i 'm quite sure some of the people campaigning for it are in turn some of the dutch guys in this very topic celebrating their ` achievement ' . 
  there wo n't be fortunately . 
  i just hope enough people show up for the referendum and vote ` no ' , so that geenstijl can crawl back to the depths of the internet . 
  the way they tried to appease regular voters and deliberately toned down their normal ( much more confronting ) tune said enough . 
  but the regular referendum sickness will probably set in : mostly people in favor will show up , and those against could very well not bother ( thus staying at home ) . 
  the biggest joke of course is calling a referendum about something the people could hardly hope to understand , nor do most people that go to vote care about this very subject . 
  as said before : this referendum has become an anti-eu thing . 
  that 's all fine , but the vote will be about that - and not about ukraine its future within the eu . 
  edit : to those unknowing , the outcome of this referendum will be an ` advisory opinion ' , thus parliament can and probably will ignore it . 
  whether it is a good thing for democracy is something i 'll let up to others to decide . 
  indeed , the pvda has become a centre party , or at least a centre-left party . 
  if you count the more conservative than progressive cda into the equation above , and add the sgp , you 'll actually see left wing parties are n't really in a majority . 
  the only true left wing parties in this country are groenlinks and moreover the sp . 
  everyone that calls himself a leftist can not refer to the pvda in the same sentence : it 's just false . 
  and indeed , as you stated : it 's mostly about sentiment . 
  sentiment is just extremely different nowadays . 
  depends to what ` g ' you are referring . 
  apparantly the original ` dutch g ' is the one found in the southern parts of the netherlands , that being the soft g. are you referring to this one ? 
  well the general trend / u/qevlarr described is correct : the netherlands have drastically shifted towards the right from 2000 onwards . 
  ` the left ' really is in big trouble down here , and i expect the pvda to finally collapse ( deservedly ! ), 
  after years of breaking election promises - as well as ostracizing their own electorate . 
  there is more and more anti eu sentiment since 2005 and further , yet you can ask yourself whether there is a majority for leaving the eu . 
  i 'm quite sure there is n't at this point , but the netherlands might find itself on the same path as the uk in 20 years time or so if people do n't even bother to understand how the eu works - and the government does n't take the time to properly explain its workings . 
  the stereotype that / u/qevlarr should 've adressed is that of tolerance itself : the netherlands in my memory has never been really tolerant , but * indifferent * . 
  that 's something completely else all together : indifference is just raising your shoulders and walking on , where tolerance needs some kind of ideological consideration or moreover a principle to start out with . 
   the spokesman also said the hospital trust was `` absolutely clear that members of her majesty 's armed forces , whether in uniform or not , should not be treated any differently to any other person '' . 
  too little too late : the difference has already been made . 
  big question is who was supposed to be ` appeased ' by this shameful measure . 
  i could type a long response to this guy 's opinion , but let 's just say that in order to renegotiate one must first have a credible position first - as well as enough allies on ` the continent ' . 
  if you take into account the massive cut the uk still gets for its eu contribution i 'd already say there is pretty little to negotiate about : the uk already is treated as ` more equal ' than others in the eu in that view . 
  and let us certainly not forget about the opt outs that were granted . 
   `` because i believe the way to solve the debt crisis , to provide better public services within europe , to get people back to work , is to ** deregulate ** , particularly within * employment * and * health and safety legislation . 
  * oh boy , not this again . 
  deregulation has shown its terrible ` advantages ' over the past 10 years or so , so we better increasingly regulate or update current regulation to prevent further excesses . 
  also , the call to deregulate on the terrain of employment is telling - as the uk has shown up in the case law of the ecj more than once on this subject . 
  well gouda cheese refers to a certain type of cheese that used to originate near the city of gouda . 
  the etymological origin of gouda is a bit unclear it seems , at least after reading a bit about it . 
  i do n't think being right wing is going to result in a mark behind your name more quickly than being left wing . 
  being at the extremes of either side can become more dangerous though . 
  but the amount of data gathering and the way it is being analyzed seems to have taken on almost dystopic proportions . 
  edit : corrected some things . 
  fair enough : would take the problem out of your hands . 
  we might as well march into judea and restore peace and prosperity there as well . 
  time to let the eu as our present day nova roma reclaim those lands !, 
  send in the legions , under command of our glorious commander , gaius - claudius - juncker !, 
  you were unlucky then : lets settle at that .
