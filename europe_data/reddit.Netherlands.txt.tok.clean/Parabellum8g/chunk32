  in short : nothing is being mixed up . 
  it is what it is , and the best slovakia can do is not fulfill its obligations . 
  it will be forced to pay a lot of damages though , but at this point that may be preferable for slovakia . 
  it has : read the link . 
  this has been developed a long time ago already in the case law of the ecj ( as long back as 40 + years ago ) . 
  it is different when treaty amendment is in place : maybe you have that example in your head ? 
  normal directives and regulations are just binding to all member states . 
  no further questions asked . 
   i 'm not sure if you 're so dumb or just do n't know what an union means . 
  the word ` union ' does not in any way imply unanimity by default . 
  more like some shared goals , and those shared goals happen to be enshrined in the tfeu and the teu . 
  the same treaties the czech republic ratified . 
  i fully understand the resentment . 
  i really do . 
  but pacta sunt servanda applies . 
  eu law trumps constitutional law . 
  see the simmenthal case - a landmark case for such situations . 
  at least i believe it was that one . 
  [ further reading ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:l14548 ) . 
  european law takes precedence over national law , even constitutional law . 
  it is over and done : the opposing states have to swallow this or be faced with the legal consequences . 
  although those consequences may be more acceptable than actually fulfilling the obligations of this decision . 
  indeed : it is appalling to see how a long term solution is still not put in place . 
  in the meanwhile the famous salami-slice strategy will be used to sell highly controversial pieces of policy in smaller bits . 
  i expect the same will happen to the greek debt for example : write offs in several distinct phases . 
  same : it apparantly is limited to voting weights instead of procedure . 
  i wonder what is next : will those opposing four accept it ? 
  or will they accept to pay damages and just keep on refusing ? 
  i know the lisbon treaty is the current treaty , but certain provisions of ` nice ' can still apply until early 2017 with respect to voting . 
  since some kind of unanimity was required in the past with regard to the necessary framework for the common asylum policy , it looks like this could result in unanimity on request . 
  i admit that the solution is n't clear cut though : this problem has surfaced multiple times on r/europe over the past weeks . 
  i 'll dive into the tfeu later today to find some satisfactory answers . 
  edit : the dutch nos suggests that a vote can be held today to force the opposing nations to agree to mandatory redistribution . 
  it is a sign that unanimity is not required , but the nos has n't really been completely right all the time . 
  edit 2 : vote passed on qmv . 
  unanimity was no possibility in this case it seems , thus the entire struggle we witnessed the past few weeks was a way to ensure consensus in the council . 
  well , that was n't what i meant although looking back it was n't really clear what i was aiming at . 
  the nice treaty still knew some element of unanimity on this subject ( even though not completely anymore ) :  article 63 - asylum , refugees , immigration policy under the new provisions of article 67 , the council may , acting by qualified majority , adopt certain measures on asylum , refugees and displaced persons , immigration policy and the rights of nationals of third countries legally resident in a member state , provided that it has previously , ** acting unanimously ** , adopted community legislation defining the common rules and basic principles governing these issues . 
  the introduction of qualified majority voting therefore remains ** subject to these conditions ** and to the prior definition of common principles in this area . 
  the codecision procedure now also applies to this article . 
  i could very well interpet it wrongly here and definitely do n't consider myself an authority on this particular subject in the treaties . 
  maybe some expert in eu law is willing to step in and enlighten us all ? 
  edit : nevermind , the vote passed on the basis of qmv . 
  ~ ~ no , unanimity is required if a nation asks for the nice standards to be used . 
  this is still possible until the end of 2017 or so and i would be extremely surprised if not a single eastern european nation asked for this . 
  this push for unanimity in the eu is n't there just for solidarity . ~ ~ ~ ~ correct me if i 'm wrong though ! ~ ~, 
  maybe surprisingly , we are mostly in agreement . 
  especially that persecution complex you describe is often highly overreacted : some guy a week or so back suggested in a comment that leftists force us to accept suicide bombings as something normal . 
  it was so * wrong * that it really made me cringe !, 
  still , despite you being right , that is n't the point here . 
  / u/godzilla0815 talked way too absolutely about the people that are ` angry ' about how the entire thing is being handled and i resisted that assumption with good reason . 
  i do n't want to turn it into some circular reasoning only based on me saying that before , but it is n't directly connected to this  . 
  there must be millions of germans that have an opinion similar to mine but are afraid to speak out , especially after merkel pretty much called them cold hearted . 
  indecision of the eu of course . 
  normally this problem gets circumvented by qmw , but that is n't applicable here . 
  it shows how intergovernmental systems of cooperation have a serious drawback , and unanimity voting is an example of a characteristic of such a system . 
  the eu is a bit of a compromise between supranationalism and intergovernamentalism , although it is more supranational in general . 
  edit : the vote just passed . 
  qmv was applicable after all . 
  yeah , i 'd figure you like to see it all fall apart now , right  . 
  and thus the eu is back at square one . 
  the sheer amount of indecision is really a bad thing here and an axe at the foundations of the eu . 
  the only thing they could decide on at this point is completely sealing the outer borders . 
  maybe they ought to first focus on that - as it actually is a long term solution - before talk about quotas . 
  has it really devolved into that ? 
  too bad that extremists of all people have to become the voice of such a social issue . 
  it really is a missed opportunity , but on the other side the people that get out there to march for these kinds of things are often rather extreme in general . 
  also directed at / u/doldenberg : i do n't really doubt that . 
  in my own experience quite a few if not over half of all people that are against immigration are that out of their own racist ideas . 
  some do n't even realize it strangely enough and will get highly defensive when you confront them with it . 
  i just reject the absolute nature of / u/godzilla0815 his comment , as he pretty much calls 100 % of them ` mentally retarded ' . 
  after all , he said : ` the only ones ' . 
  i do not doubt that a lot of them are just hateful persons that add jack shit , but valid criticism with no racist implications should not be placed in the corner ` mentally retarded ' . 
  account age : 1 day . 
  welcome to / r/europe , although i figure this was n't your first visit . 
   the only ones that are angry about it are the mentally retarded again : this is what gives the left wing such a bad name . 
  the presumptiousness is really disturbing , nor it is any way correct , fair or justified . 
  oh come on , you guys are basically like brabanders and limburgers , albeit with a fucked up version of dutch . 
  looking at the source , what could one expect ? 
  `` reported for racism '' . 
  reading all these replies it makes me think that finding a new judge for the us supreme court is easy cake compared to this . 
  complete and thorough background checks , including political allegiance . 
  ` settling ' the score with others . 
  funny to see if i distance myself from the entire thing for a moment . 
  there was n't . 
  i 've read the dutch article and perfectly understood the text of course ( me being dutch ) . 
  i mailed the mods about it , do n't worry . 
  there indeed was no editorialization : the reason for removal is therefore false . 
  ** edit : ** a mod which i shall not name responded to me claiming that the title itself was not editorialized , but that the article * itself was * . 
  i mailed a reply contending this position but am still waiting for a response . 
  until then i 'll just wait . 
  we will sink that island of yours one day . 
  i think we just got back to a problem we discussed some time back , including ` interpretation ' within civil law systems . 
  the ecj got a history of really extensive interpretation of the treaties ( and its legal predecessors ) . 
  are you sure you are n't stuck into the statutory law thought as you know it in the uk ? 
  in each case , if i understand statutory law in the uk correctly it is created and written in such a way that there is little to almost no possibility to extensively interpret something . 
  i know it sounds like a logical contradiction - and i do follow your argument - but do n't you think the ecj * could * come to some kind of ` implied membership ' verdict about scotland ? 
  at the same time i immediatly attack this point of view , as other member states that object to it ( spain for example ) would 've been effectively sidelined . 
  then again , the verdicts of the ecj have to be observed by the member states ( so say the treaties ) . 
  it remains difficult to see what the answer would be .
