   for the ecj to declare that iscotland remained a member of the eu if the uk were to leave the eu would effectively be ignoring a body of international law on treaties and secession of states . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but imagine this : in a matter of weeks after scotland 's hypothetical secession , almost all european nations acknowledge scotland as sovereign state . 
  this is a clear indication to the ecj of scotland its position in the world and moreover in the eu , so why would it not be able to ask itself the question whether the newborn ( or reborn ? ), 
  nation state of scotland did inherit eu membership from its mother state ? 
  at least , i expect the ecj to look at the other eu member states their reaction to this hypothethical situation . 
  the simpler solution would indeed be just following the normal route - and all the hurdles associated with it - but that 's a bit boring now is n't it  . 
  in other words : because the uk government has conscientiously acted as it has it is obliged to keep its former position . 
  sounds fair , although i do n't see the icj give its verdict about it if the uk * were * to make a fuss about it after all . 
  do n't forget that this is a highly sensitive issue and government policy on the matter could easily turn around . 
  in case of the un for example , scotland would become a new taiwan if the uk would actually be resentful about scotland breaking away . 
  not to say that un membership is a necessary indicator for being a state ( it is surely not ) , but this could be another complication . 
  i say breaking away as scotland leaving could be a bit more messy then thought of now . 
  i would not be surprised if the relationship between edinburgh and london would be more catalan/spanish like . 
   people ca n't fully understand many aspects of government policy but are still allowed to vote on it . 
  yeah ... that is always the ultimate counter to the thing i just said . 
  and you are ** right ** about it by the way : it testifies of a type of hypocrisy to say that people can not decide on a referendum but * can * vote on a party during elections ( while apparantly having interpreted dozens of difficult subjects ) . 
  still , there is a problem to be noticed here in terms of what people on average know and the complexity of the problem they need to vote about . 
  at some point there needs to be a solution but it feels like any fix to it would be highly controversial . 
  consensus is best , but it is hard to see how this will be achieved by the time of the referendum . 
  i think a large split will occur that is going to have its aftereffects for another 20-30 years or so . 
  could you expand on this a little ? 
  this part deals mainly with the european context , not international law in general . 
  or were you referring to my other comment ? 
  pro eu in the sense that is he pro eu provided that he can renegotiate the uk its position with the eu . 
  in practice this will mean getting rid of some the disadvantages , while keeping most of the advantages , thereby screwing over other member states . 
  after all : if the uk gets what it wants , other states could try the same in my view . 
  cameron is just playing the british public with a popular subject most people could not hope to fully understand . 
  insert a lot of tabloid garbage into the equation that is fanning the flames and you know that this referendum is a big mistake . 
  british businesses are against it as well , but it is going to continue nevertheless . 
  i hope the uk finds the wisdom to vote ` yes ' in 2017 though . 
  interesting read : thanks for linking it !, 
  is 2016 decided already then ? 
  thought it still was a plan to move the referendum forward towards this year . 
  and about that referendum : you are ** way ** too convinced about where it will go . 
  at this point we 're still many months away from it and any real indication of the result can only be given on the day of the referendum itself . 
  there will be a lot of campaigning from all involved parties to move the electorate in a certain desired direction and this will in turn influence public opinion . 
  even now , most polls tend to balance around a 50/50 split . 
  the results surely are n't convincing so far . 
  the key lies with the ecj . 
  unless i am missing something here the treaties are completely silent on the event of a country/region of another member state secceding . 
  i would n't be surprised if the ecj rules that scotland would ` inherit ' its membership via the uk if it were to leave . 
  the ecj is renowned and loathed for its ` creative ' interpretations . 
  thanks for the ` country ' part : i did n't know it was actually called that within the uk its structure . 
  this actually strengthens a cause for seccession , as it makes scotland even more autonomous and thus it can easier seccede . 
  basically now i think about it the uk it 's structure is already a bit federal as it is right now , due to the powers of the scottish parliament . 
  none . 
  truth be told i would chuckle a little if that were to happen : the uk would get rid for its eu membership at the cost of scotland secceding . 
  it would be the ultimate punishment for opportunist politics of the type cameron likes so much and above all a warning to others . 
  but let 's see what happens in 2017 . 
  if the uk leaves the eu the result may be pyrrhic . 
  whatever happens , either a brexit or scotland secceding , both result in a massive legal headache for the ecj and european governments . 
  especially the scenario of scotland secceding is very troubling , although i figure that the ecj out of its own historical creativity will find some kind of way out without scotland having to apply for membership ( and walk the regular procedures ) . 
  if you want to make it impossible for scotland to seccede under international law , you surely should not walk that path . 
  member states from federations have a much stronger case for secession than ~ ~ regions ~ ~ countries within more unitary and more centralised states . 
  in short , if you want to prevent scotland from not being recognized as a sovereign state after a possible secession you should rather campaign for further centralisation of powers or at least maintaining the status quo . 
  this is just the rough legal framework . 
  my opinion on the matter is not included above . 
  * edit * to clarify some parts a little : former soviet republics and states originating from former yugoslavia were automatically acknowledged based on a more federal structure of the mother state . 
  if you do n't fall into those categories , which were exceptions to begin with , you 'll have to play the ` recognition ' game . 
  this should n't be too hard for scotland , so what was said above is probably irrelevant in that sense . 
  i did n't really follow the case of those men , but [ apparantly ] ( http://www.nu.nl/politiek/3824982/rechter-acht-asiel-somalische-piraten-terecht-afgewezen.html ) the junior minister of justice at the time denied their request for asylum . 
  they appealed and lost the subsequent appeal . 
  as they have no right to asylum i expect them to have been deported a while ago already . 
  stuff like this has been done in somalia , of course after the pirates in question were taken off the boat . 
  i believe the dutch navy did so as well some time ago . 
  yeah , for some reason it also got a soldiery ring to it . 
  i do n't know why . 
  this !, 
  i wonder whether there will be ever some change in this . 
  bread here is of terrible quality compared to bread in germany for example . 
  cancer is expensive , but then again i like a cigarette from time to time . 
  the diversity is completely contrary to what we see today . 
  people are obsessed with the migration subject day after day , uttering their opinions day after day , while not many significant changes happen in the meanwhile in terms of policy . 
  i have the greatest trouble understanding what the use is in giving your rather unchanged opinion on it each and every day if you are just interested in discourse . 
  the motivations behind it are therefore likely to be found in the corner of agenda pushers and hateful ideas in general . 
  the funniest of all is the overwhelming presence of ` concerned ' people that live in countries which have almost zero naturalized migrants in their nations population . 
  the same people that never see one from up close seem to have the strongest opinion of it , which is beyond curious . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  can confirm / u/swirly023 his assessment : most of the times , if not almost always , the description of a person having a ` northern african appearance ' is indeed a polite way to say he/she is a moroccan . 
  that does it not mean it is conclusive though ( i 'm not suggesting that !, 
  ) , but * often * it does mean suspect x actually is moroccan . 
  quite embarassing , but you should check out mark rutte speaking english . 
  it really is the definition of ` cringe ' . 
  account name : throwaway12312312316 . 
  you definitely are n't a shill account . 
  indeed . 
  maybe we 're taking too many precautions , but on the other side it 's understandable that the police is on their toes after the near-massacre in france . 
  if something had happened the backlash would likely have been tremendous . 
  i did n't know wilders was * that * well known in france . 
  seems like i missed / u/dclauzel his implied sarcasm : / . 
  oh , aboutdesouffle made the same mistake , though you were the first guy that introduced it to this string of comments . 
  and yeah , he got a really strong opinion on things but still i think you should n't make yourself a target like this . 
  it is n't necessary and mostly works in your disadvantage - as it gives you the appearance of someone that wants to overshout others . 
  it is not , yet you said ` no women and children ' , which means 0 of them on a scale to 100 . 
  so in that sense he was n't wrong . 
  personal anecdotes indeed have less value , yet you in turn can not equate high turnout to people having a positive opinion on the state of our democracy . 
  the number does n't tell you anything about that : it only tells you how many of the people eligible to vote showed up . 
  next to that you should not deny , ignore or downplay the effects of campaigning . 
  i 'll try to link you some polls tomorrow if i can , mostly polls about either voters general disappointment in their party ( on average taken after a coalition was formed ) or on specific issues . 
  the eu is of course another example of such specific issues , although my opinion on it does n't correspond with the still increasing anti eu sentiment here .
