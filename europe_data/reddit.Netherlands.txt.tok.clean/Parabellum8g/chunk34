  turnout during elections says close to nothing . 
  people are actually being lured to the ballot box during campaign time and not seldomly large chunks of the voterbase of party x regret that they voted for it after elections . 
  we both know this , so lets ignore the turnout . 
  what is way more useful of a tool to measure how happy people find themselves to be are opinion polls . 
  and those very polls regularly tell a different story . 
  then there 's of course the shitload of cynicism i encounter in my daily life and the internet about politics here . 
  confidence is low at best after numerous broken election promises , and this can be noticed everywhere if you are willing to listen to it . 
  edit : not to mention that parliament not infrequently seems to have different ideas than those prevalent in society . 
  the mediocre applause yesterday during the asylum debate was again an example of it : such behavior is completely out of the ordinary . 
  quite a few of them made me smirk . 
  he 's clumsy is n't he ? 
  three sentences containing three ad hominem attacks as a main ` argument ' . 
  if you really want to prove you 're better this is literally the worst way to convince others . 
  maybe change your approach ? 
  you should ask that question to marine le pen again . 
  oh , it is rather obvious that nobody is denying that . 
  a lot of european nations have drastically shifted towards the right * and * are still moving in that direction . 
  left-wing parties all over europe are in trouble , with the marginalisation of labour in the uk and the pvda in the netherlands as just two examples . 
  i 'm not a leftwinger , so in the short term there is little reason to care for me personally . 
  in the longterm this may be a different story , but that aside . 
  but there is a lot of brigading going on here - proven brigading - that has really changed the general vibe here . 
  despite the massive growth in userbase it is a rather hard to imagine that suddenly / r/europe shifted from a bit left leaning as it was a year ago to almost far-right . 
  if you also take a look at how unrelated topics are often downvoted it is not hard to again suspect some kind of coordinated effort to actively push up immigration topics and influence the opinion of close to half a million people . 
  it 's difficult to say which of the two has influenced / r/europe more though . 
  indeed : i never even thought of using that terminology again , how witty of you :p . only difference this time it is not a split among ideological lines but more among cultural or even ethnic lines . 
  be careful with that . 
  the people responding here are a very specific demographic and should n't be equated to ` your average european citizen ' . 
  i know it 's tempting ( i 've done that before i think ... ) , but it 's plain wrong . 
  neither do i , at least often on the solutions he proposes ; it however gets more ambigious on the way he simply * deals * with subjects . 
  wilders seems repeatedly willing to discuss even the most controversial things in a very down to earth , almost plebeian manner where other politicians do n't dare to touch it . 
  i have no trouble admitting that i commend him for it , but as said before : his solutions are lacking . 
  he really is a tough guy to deal with and is a true master in the tu quoque style type of reasoning which he performs flawlessly , but yet again he 's not the only one that likes to do this on a regular basis . 
  there is no politician in the current chamber that uses such techniques as often though , nor is anyone as well versed in it . 
  him as pm would completely split this nation and could even lead to violence . 
  but the same could be said about the present chamber and government if the problem i described lingers on , a problem that has been there for many years already . 
  personally i have the greatest trouble determining which of the two is more dangerous . 
  hehe , could you give me an example ? 
  or two ? 
  yeah , it is stuff like this that gives the left wing a really bad name . 
  rather sad that a rightwinger has to point this out to you , but as long as you keep echoing that broken record just to shut up someone else you are doomed to be not taken seriously . 
  a rather bad example of it to be honest , but honestly : where in europe did integration actually go right ? 
  i often joke that the netherlands is indeed a multicultural society : a society in which multiple cultures live completely * past each other * , instead of next to each other . 
  the netherlands is pretty segregated and there is by far not enough interaction between say native dutch people and e.g. 
  there are a lot of understandable underlying reasons for it , but i 'm just describing what it is like here . 
  the multicultural society in this country has been nothing but a hoax . 
  it ** never ** existed outside of the minds of the people that proclaimed it . 
  that would give me some comic relief to be honest . 
  i 'd feel flattered that another well known dutchman is again one of our worst citizens . 
  whether it be joran van der sloot or frans van anraat : our worst export products tend to ` stick ' in the minds of people . 
  not to say that the guy does n't have his uses ( as he does point things out that are more ` alive ' with the people , so kudos for him on that part ) , but he often falls short on solutions . 
  then there 's the thing of him trying to incite some kind of razzia versus moroccans some time back when he had a crowd shout ` minder , minder , minder ' ( less , less , less ! ), 
  after he asked if those people wanted to have more or less moroccans in the netherlands . 
  he followed it up with the ambigious ` dat gaan we regelen ! ', 
  - we 're going to arrange that !, 
  well put : this is his goal , even though each and every politician is guilty to that in some extent . 
  however , today 's comment by him about the dutch parliament having lost [ all touch ] ( http://nos.nl/video/2058278-wilders-dit-is-een-nepparlement.html ) with the people by calling it a * fake * parliament - though misplaced - did convincingly deal with the disconnect between parliament and the people in general . 
  pechtold tried to rebuff what he said - but did n't dare to touch the disconnect wilders described . 
  for me wilders is a comedian which i 'd rather not see ruling anytime soon . 
  but he is a necessary comedian as well as it seems , as apparantly only he is interested in bridging the gap between the people and its rulers . 
  mind you : this gap has the potential to destroy democracy in a few generations - possibly even sooner - if it widens even further . 
  it is a sad day if wilders has to be the one to remind parliament of that again . 
  yeah , sounds a bit more precise . 
  or just politicians in general , or ` german politicians ' if you 'd like . 
   eu politicians how did you come to the conclusion that the mayor of duisburg , a german city , speaks for the eu ? 
  or in any way participates in european politics on a regular level like say merkel ? 
  a bit weird to attribute his comment to the eu do n't you think ? 
  excuse me : i did n't really think about any negative load when writing it down . 
  just wanted to emphasize that there are large numbers of people thinking the same . 
  that 's just the ultimate controversial comment for this debate . 
  i am going to lean back with some snacks and watch how this thing unfolds . 
  do n't equate the actions of european governments with those of their respective peoples . 
  there is often a disconnect to be observed between both . 
  sometimes this is for good , but in my perception more often for worse . 
  waiting for things to blow over , and letting others take the fall right ? 
  i believe that is mutti 's strategy , if i can at least trust the judgement of quite a few germans here . 
  attack his points , not the person . 
  do n't say this : it goes against the general panic tripe here . 
  it amazes me how so many people here - mostly young men in the prime of their lives - are so fucking afraid of isis and think they could achieve so much . 
  it kind of confirms that people in the west have become cowards . 
  again : it shows that terror works . 
  that 's not how i think about it : i 'm just saying that the odds are slim thus people should n't really worry about it . 
  of course i agree that everybody that enters into europe needs to be properly registered and be categorized according to the perceived threat level of each individual - difficult as that is to determine . 
  next to that , other measures need to be taken where necessary . 
  but in the end you can not fully exclude the risk of a terror attack - and everyone should just accept this reality . 
  to get so hysterical about something that you or me extremely unlikely ever will fall victim to is a bit too much for me . 
  it shows that the strategy behind terrorism actually works , and the media have one hell of a role to play in this . 
  i often browse the front page of the telegraaf for my own amusement - as the telegraaf really got a habit of inflating stuff ( especially scary things ) - and this really stayed stuck in the back of my mind . 
  how constructive again . 
  maybe you should attack what he said , instead of the person hm ? 
  you actually served there ? 
  could you tell me a bit more about it ? 
  also , if you 've seen such terrible things it 's not hard to imagine why you feel like this . 
  it 's not wrong to worry about the safety of your children . 
  yet you have to ask yourself whether the fear in this particular case is rational , although i figure this * can * be a bit different for someone that lives in sweden ( given sweden 's asylum policy ) . 
  and as / u/burningfox says , this concern will always be there . 
  at some point you just have to let it go and not be afraid . 
  those guys that want to scare you ** thrive ** on it . 
  let 's not give them their way , shall we ? 
  exactly . 
  people need to learn to get rid of their irrational fear for terrorism .
