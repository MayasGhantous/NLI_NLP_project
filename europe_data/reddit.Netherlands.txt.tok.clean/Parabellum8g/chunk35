  those isis guys can not hope to possibly overthrow western states : the only thing they can achieve is causing panic and a lot of deaths ( if they 're lucky ) . 
  as long as people stay afraid for those savages , they ** will ** have won . 
  fear for terrorism has really crossed all reasonable levels in the shadow of 9/11 . 
  ** edit : ** yep , that 's the / r/europe i know again . 
  you have nothing to fear people , just accept it for once . 
  you better worry about putting your seatbelt on when you get into your car . 
  not putting your seatbelt on : that actually kills a 1000 times more people in europe than isis on a yearly basis . 
  the thing with the megatopics is that they did n't really get refreshed on a daily basis , which made discussing recent news close to impossible there . 
  any comment you made would quickly get burried because of it . 
  a new thread would n't get made after 500 comments for example . 
  also , a bit more guidance from the mod team in the sense of ` what do you think ' , or , ` how should we solve this ' in the top would 've helped keeping it all more constructive . 
  the megatopics were n't a response to an ` unwanted ' subject : they were a response to prevent this sub clogging up with the * same * subject , and to counter brigading as well . 
  there * are * merits to that , whether you agree to it or not . 
  also , one 's rights end where the rights of others begin - and the people that often post the asinine shit i talk about do n't care about that . 
  not to mention that not each random opinion is worth the same . 
  some guy that says something without thinking it through does n't need to count on his opinion being allowed to stay there after all . 
  ever since i 've visited my first internet forum in days past moderators always had enough manoevering space to remove terrible content . 
  i do n't have any objection to removing an opinion that is unconstructive or ( as we also often see here ) downright hateful or even ( close to ) hate speech . 
  as always , thanks for your efforts though . 
  same goes for all the other people that do this on a voluntary basis : i imagine it 's not always the most rewarding of jobs to put it lightly . 
  you better quickly expand the mod team , let 's keep it at that . 
  i am under the impression that agenda pushing is n't really being punished so far - because it is way too labour intensive of a rule to enforce . 
  not really : people just can not tolerate each others opinion anymore . 
  whether it is right wing or left wing , during popular topics it results in some highly intolerant behavior . 
  the downvote button * for comments * is something reddit needs to remove - or at least give an option to remove it to moderators - as it is being highly abused . 
  by individuals and organised brigades . 
  the general atmosphere in immigration posts can often be summarized in words as ` hostile ' , ` circklejerk ' and ` overall emotional ' . 
  people are n't interested in a solution most of the time : you just see them constantly complain in a string of asinine posts . 
  this was n't the case here about a year ago , nor 9 months ago . 
  it really started to go to shit since 5 or 6 months ago , and it has been steadily increasing in severity . 
  add proven brigading to it and the madness is complete . 
  i really * hated * the megathreads and openly doubted the moderators their ideas about it . 
  but after all of this i just have to conclude / u/theskynet was right ( former mod ) - at least i thought he was a driving force behind the megatopics . 
  at this point i 'd rather see them come back , or at least be given a filter button , so one particular subject does n't dominate an entire subreddit . 
  in the short term it will cause turmoil , but after a few weeks it will all die down . 
  i regret to admit that / r/europe indeed was a much better place when those megathreads were still in place . 
  well , points for honesty . 
  i imagine you thought twice about giving a straight answer to it ( as it directly touches the subject of moderation itself ) , so thanks for being open . 
  i could ask you to rethink current policy , but i think there 's more than enough internal discussion going on about it already - making that request obsolete . 
  indeed , otherwise it does n't ` sell ' . 
  a bit more positive news for a change would be nice - but i guess this is how the ` news business ' works . 
  what is most disturbing though is that so much of it originates from a select few entities , like reuters and anp . 
  heh , you made me smile  . 
  i think even the most stubborn cultural relativist would n't even doubt the importance of this topic . 
  the way it is being handled though - and moreover discussed - is often below all standards . 
  what i mostly notice is a lot of emotion : a great deal of anger , resentment and other highly negative stuff . 
  i 'd be the last one that does n't understand that this is the direct result of politicians losing touch with the people and not even bothering to explain them ` why ' something is what it is . 
  as a result they take it out here and on other places ( although i suspect there 's quite some brigading going on as well ) . 
  but if you see how people just keep on bitching about it , day after day , it makes you wonder what their real motivations are . 
  use [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3j79ef/ann_topic_filters_for_reurope_are_here/ ) . 
  it will keep you unbothered by the agenda pushers . 
  thank you so much !, 
  you 've done what the moderators due to circumstances have ommitted to do , that is taking care of this subreddit . 
  the latter includes getting rid of extremists and other scum that only want to send a message of hatred . 
  well i have no problem with the subject to be honest . 
  i have a problem with the same subject being advertised in the same topics each and every day . 
  if you had an opinion on the subject yesterday it probably is n't different today . 
  there 's hardly anything happening - as governments do n't want to come to a concrete solution - so i do n't see the point in discussing this subject as much as it is in / r/europe . 
  honestly : i think it 's just neonazi 's and other far right groups that are really agenda pushing a lot . 
  i also notice it with unrelated topics like this one : they get downvoted for little reason so that the immigration topics get pushed upwards much faster . 
  it really seems to be a coordinated effort . 
  at this point , i start to long for the megatopics that i hated so much a few weeks ago . 
  / r/europe has certainly gone down the drain after everyone was free to post about it again . 
  thank you very much !, 
  question : is the mod team happy with how the entire frontpage is flooded with topics that deal with the same very subject ? 
  i ca n't imagine you guys are happy with the ` diversity ' of / r/europe as of today . 
  you should realize that moderates will get the hell out due to this , as 1 ) it 's impossible to argue in those topics , 2 ) there is almost nothing else to be found on the frontpage . 
  this turns these people off - while you will desperately need them while / r/europe keeps on growing . 
  that 's not the point : almost all content seems to be about it . 
  you can hardly find any other topics as you have to wade through all the migration topics first . 
  a filter button at least gives people like us the chance to just filter it away on demand . 
  the topics will still remain there . 
  same here : we really need a filter button at this point . 
  otherwise if this keeps up it 's time to move on i guess . 
  any suggestions ? 
  a presidential l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 ? 
  i mean , this is what it comes down to - and it is another worrying step towards what turkey is sadly changing into . 
  i really feel for the non-ak voting turks that are extremely unhappy about this . 
  it feels the irrational part of the population is surprising the better side . 
  what a relief to still find another topic outside of the usual categories . 
  close to 90 percent of the frontpage is about immigration/islam , so just about everything that is different is a cause for celebration . 
  nice try : you ca n't use sarcasm as an escape in all situations . 
  you truly meant at least part of it , which makes a call to it not possible . 
  you just described some conflicting parts as multiple personality disorder , where hypocrisy would 've sufficed . 
  and my sarcasm bone is not broken : my own sense of humor is to be found in that very corner , albeit with a more bitter and cynical aftertaste . 
  nope , he is right . 
  the keyword is unanimity though . 
  germany is the new usa . 
  grats to all americans out there : you just gained a lot of new friends . 
  the extreme right you mean . 
  thanks for being so nuanced . 
   because seriously , it sounds like multiple personality disorder to me ... ah , the good old layman psycho diagnosis . 
  this one pops up once every week or so , but it 's more rare than other fallacies . 
  that you dislike the eu : fine . 
  i 'm completely ok with that . 
  pulling stuff out of your ass that directly fits in some conspiracy corner , that being ` it was based on people letting the germans get their way to stop them getting cunty again ' is not ok though . 
  it also betrays that you 've only known about the eu the past few years . 
  you probably have little idea about how it functions or how it came into existence into the first place . 
  you completely omit the role of france in the equation for example , nor do you seem to realize or care that the eu its role goes much further than petty cases like the one of greece for example . 
  the eu was built on solidarity , works on solidarity and continues to operate on that principle .
