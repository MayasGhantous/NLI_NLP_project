  there needs be an alternative to gps as quickly as possible - and galileo will fill in this gap . 
  it is the most preferable option at this point , provided that it does n't in itself lead to a civil war or large scale atrocities . 
  erdogan will ruin turkey if he manages to stay into power for another 5 to 10 years and seemingly only the military can stop the tide at this point . 
  democracy probably wo n't solve the issue . 
  nationalism . 
  a low-context culture does have its merits of course , but the traditions we have are sometimes just downright embarrassing . 
  but it is completely understandable that a straight-to-your-face type of attitude is a real relief after living in a society where people for example communicate in the most indirect of ways . 
  i mostly agree to this , even though the netherlands is split among ethnic lines nowadays . 
  there is little interaction between dutch moroccans and say native dutch people , and the same goes for turks/dutch people , surinamers/dutch people , etc. 
  therefore to call our culture homogenous carries way too far nowadays , as it is basically a multicutural society where multiple groups live completely past each other . 
  taking reddit 's demographic into account : probably because of weed . 
  to be honest : you do n't come to this place for the horrible , artificial landscape or our non-complex down to earth culture . 
  the fact that most people here speak english will have contributed as well : you can live in the netherlands without ever having to speak dutch if you want to . 
  yes . 
  but i take it that most people abided by the gentlemans agreement to not vote for their own country . 
  no they surely wo n't and i do n't expect them to ever allow the kurdish part of turkey to secede without massive bloodshed . 
  the thing is that the current situation indeed * can * give rise to a real and intense civil war in south eastern turkey as long as kurds are systematically left behind . 
  erdogan does n't care obviously : this democratically elected ( such irony ... ) semi-dictator has no trouble unleashing a war just to win the upcoming elections . 
  kurdish separatists will continue to try and create the kurdistan they want , especially now it is closer than ever . 
  the kurdish region in iraq is de facto independent , and the kurdish parts of syria are de facto autonomous . 
  whatever turn the syrian civil war and associated spillover takes , a kurdish state in these regions is surely no impossible scenario . 
  i imagine western nations will happily recognize such a state when it is proclaimed , given the good relations between both . 
  in that light , a bloody war of secession in turkey may sadly indeed be on the horizon . 
  it is not like ankara will give the kurds in turkey the far reaching autonomy they would like to have . 
  the current turkish administration will by its own actions ensure that this is a possible scenario . 
  might as well pass liz her crown to mutti whenever the former leaves this world . 
  it would n't be the first german monarch that ascends to the throne of the uk  . 
  just imagine the sheer efficiency it would result in . 
  strange humor you northerners have  . 
  yep , it 's all pretty much all in the same corner of overwhelming rationalism . 
  plenty of rain and snow does that apparantly . 
  i guess you like my soft g , do n't you  . 
  sweden , norway , finland , denmark , the uk and italy . 
  pretty limited list , though i like many more countries than this . 
  but ... what about comfortable north-brabant ? 
  there is no need to traverse to the savages above the major rivers : plenty of room here in the south . 
  and no annoying accents . 
  fair enough : i think you make some good points . 
  the guilt trip by the way did not exclusively refer to the nazi period : especially the pegida protests which were broadcast all over the world were something that angered quite a few germans . 
  this response is therefore understandable , even though i do n't really like it . 
   you need to treat the root cause and the symptoms . 
  i agree and do n't deny that , but i emphasized the ` symptoms ' part as a true structural solution for the root cause is still far away . 
  therefore being a bit too generous will not unlikely lead to a magnetizing effect - and i think germany does not have the right to bother other nations with its own views on the subject . 
  what a lot of people apparantly fear is a neverending influx of refugees as they do n't expect some structural solution . 
  in short : there is little point in treating the symptoms . 
   it 's amazing how your gaze can penetrate the skulls of 80 million people . 
  not 80 million people : i am referring to the people that so emotiously and shamelessly get out there promoting this type of self serving generosity , while they were no where to be found during other severe refugee crisis in the world over the past few years !, 
  people feel like they * owe * something due to the media its excessive reporting on this issue , and i truly doubt their honesty . 
  as said before : social gain is probably on top of their agenda , the good old showing off how ` involved ' you are . 
  compassion is a good thing when it is genuine : i doubt this is fully the case though . 
  i know : it is a personal opinion , but i 've seen this stuff happen much more often on a smaller scale . 
  people want to buy off that feeling of having alledgedly done some ` wrong ' , and there is a tendency to compensate for that in a rather embarrassing way . 
  in case it is still necessary to remark : i do not deny the existence of altruism as a character trait . 
  i just think that it is not as abundant as people like to think it is . 
   refusing to join the `` hey , yes , technically you have the right to apply for asylum , but , ahem , today it 's really . . umm ... inconvenient , you understand ? '', 
  game . 
  the `` do n't you dare to exercise a right '' game . 
  let 's not even get into the legal consequences of what said migrants are doing at the moment - as there are some problems associated with looking for the best country to ask asylum in . 
  besides , i think people 's idea of the rechtsstaat is imbedded enough to let them question the content of the law itself , not the validity of it . 
  i agree , yet we have to be realistic as well : eastern european member states will likely not give in . 
  well maybe after tremendous diplomatic pressure that might happen , but a lot need to happen before that becomes even possible . 
  probably this will have to go hand in hand with some kind of threat towards said nations - and this will further damage the eu its reputation and influence in that part of europe . 
  i think much of the criticism at germany is directed at this image in the media - partially justified - of germany that kind of presents itself as a migrant magnet . 
  there is a clear problem here that needs to be solved at a european level , but germany its attitude directly influences the countries surrounding it - especially the ones between turkey and germany . 
  criticism on orban his dictatorial tendencies aside , germany is burdening his country for example by being so seemingly open to migrants . 
  maybe there should be less of a role of member states in this entire ordeal to prevent europe coming over as conflicted as it is nowadays . 
  it is a european problem for sure - thus it needs a european solution - but the entire divide among european nations gets fueled by this ` magnet ' effect as well . 
  i hope a solution will be quickly found . 
  again : you miss the point . 
  what i notice so often on / r/europe is this narrative that you are either completely in favor of opening the floodgates or you must be completely in favor of locking down europe and shooting refugees on sight . 
  why is there no middle ground here so often ? 
  each and every time this discussion and simular topics get framed in some moralistic corner where it does n't even belong in the first place . 
  i care a great deal for the people who have been forced to leave the butchery is seems to be running nowadays , next to the presence of other extremist militant groups in present syria . 
  and let 's not forget assad , that does n't seem to care about those people that belong to other denominations than his own , especially sunni 's . 
  but once again : there are multiple countries around syria where all these syrians can be harbored . 
  people like to think that large numbers of refugees equate some kind of impossibility to give all these people aid . 
  the libanon example in that regard is pretty popular , while all that is needed is additional funds . 
  much more funds to be precise , so that all can be taken care off in a proper and respectful manner . 
  next to that : there are multiple stops between wealthy germany and syria - and you can not ignore this fact . 
  there is a good point to be made about saying these people are all economic migrants by the time they reach germany . 
  help them by sending our own experts and monetary aid , but do n't for a single second make it look like we want to draw all of them to europe . 
  you probably do n't like this - as you 're being rather condescending in calling my reply ` lack of empathy ' - but there is ** nothing morally responsible ** about enabling a brain drain of syria 's best and brightest . 
  at some point this civil war will be over one way or another : either one side or coalition wins , or syria will be split up . 
  all those people that fled syria will be needed to rebuild their country . 
  once they have settled in europe , they will not return . 
  and i would n't blame them if i were in the same situation ten years down the line . 
  i guess a lot of countries out there and the electorates belonging to said countries are assholes/racists/insert generalisation . 
  but really , the way so many germans react nowadays can indeed be called nothing else but a guilt trip : everyone want to show how morally superior they are , while neglecting to think of long term effects or taking action against the root cause of the mass influx of refugees/migrants . 
  not to say that germany is alone in this : over here you have swarms of people as well that like to show how much they care , if only to buy off their own sense of guilt . 
  to be frank , i compare it to the people that go to church once a year during christmas or donate after something terrible happened which was readily exploited in the media . 
  altruism ? 
  not really : people want to * show off * how good they are in order to get social approval , while not for a single second thinking one step ahead . 
  syria could be stabilized by sending ground forces , yet this is apparantly ` taboo ' to discuss . 
  another way would be to increase aid to lebanon and turkey , as well as jordan and iraq , in order to ensure that the vast number of syrian refugees there can be properly taken care off . 
  if need be , this can be accompanied by sending additional people like doctors and other needed personnel . 
  it 's not like there is * only * one option , that one being opening the floodgates . 
  ** disclaimer ** . 
  before people frame me about this : those refugees/migrants that are already in europe should be properly taken care off and this burden should not fall exclusively upon germany and sweden ( relatively speaking ) . 
  but i 'm getting sick of this idea that we have to triage all the suffering in the world . 
  exactly .
