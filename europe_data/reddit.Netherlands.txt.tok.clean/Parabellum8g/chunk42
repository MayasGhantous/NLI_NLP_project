  that 's what i predict , but we 'll see how it pans out ( so get back to me when we know the answer in about 1,5 to 2 years  ) . 
  but who knows : maybe the british people apparantly think it is in their best interest to leave , and britain will actually leave after cameron comes back sort of empty handed . 
  i do n't dare predict what the outcome of the referendum would be in that case , though i have a good idea . 
   does the eu really know what it is doing ? 
  does the uk really need to be in it any more ? 
  maybe a bit boring , but i could turn the question around as well . 
  does the uk know what it is doing ? 
  does the eu still need the uk , given that has more and more become and obstacle within the eu ? 
  sometimes it feels like the cameron administration gives extremely little thought to the consequences of the uk leaving the eu , if only for short term popular gain . 
  the very reason the euro had to endure some severe blows over the past few years is similar to the one about the ongoing immigration crisis : lack of central coordination . 
  each and every time there is fuss about transferring fundamental , necessary powers to the eu and the trend seems to be as follows : --  1 ) decline a transfer of powers out of ideological reasons --  2 ) wait for the entire thing to go wrong --  3 ) adjust by doing what was proposed under 1 ) after all ( pragmatism takes over , in other words ) . 
  i fully understand how much of a controversial thing the eu might be in the eyes of those many people that are n't really interested or impressed by the european project . 
  i honestly do . 
  but why the hell do we consider it a good idea to not guard the outer borders of the eu properly ? 
  considering that we are in a ` borderless ' ( internally at least ) union this ca n't be a logical thing to do . 
  why are a few states responsible for this , while the entire eu profits from freedom of movement ? 
  what amazes me the most though is that both are n't really applicable to the uk , due to it having an opt-out on the euro as well as the fact that the uk still patrols its borders . 
  still there is so much attention to it , while the eu itself is not to blame for it . 
  i guess that years of disinformation and tabloid brainwashing has ensured we 've come to this . 
  well the germans are of course bound to their own constitution . 
  it is amazing to see how the entire influx of non-european people with widely different cultural attitudes is regarded as a ` test ' for germany its constitutional values , and how ` not done ' it still is in said nation to criticize the influx of immigrants . 
  i will add that this probably has to do with the recent rise in rightwing extremist incidents in germany , thus the discussion has become somewhat forced into the corner of ` if you do n't want to help them , you 're an extremist / cold-hearted person ' ( direct quote from merkel ) . 
  as for the terrorism thingy : you ca n't provide 100 % safety , and a few will always slip through if they are deadset on wreaking havoc . 
  we should get rid of our fear for terrorist attacks and just acknowledge not everything can be prevented , sad as it might be . 
  as you correctly stated : one guy with a bomb is enough . 
  europe will not disintegrate after one measly terror attack . 
  by the way , i would still like to hear why you think the eu has been hijacked for political gain . 
  you seem to have skipped that part  . 
   i feel like the whole concept has been hijacked for political gain i 'm very interested in the reasons behind this part . 
  could you expand on this a little ? 
  also , despite the fact that the migrant crisis is one of the most important topics in europe at the moment , i 'd say it is rather unimportant in the grander scheme - specifically the uk 's membership of the eu . 
  it is a detail , really - even though we both acknowledge the problem . 
  edit : people do n't get it again . 
  i am talking about the subject of immigration ** within ** the much larger topic of the uk its membership of the eu . 
  this comprises way more subjects - much more than most people can think of - and in that light immigration is indeed a detail . 
  for europe as a whole immigration is one of its biggest challenges - that is not contested . 
  alright , but why now ? 
  why exactly during the time when russian-baltic relations are extremely strained ? 
  it could all be a coincidence - and just the pursuit of justice - but the timing would still be unfortunate if that is the case . 
  if you happen to have some in depth knowledge about the way the lithuanian public prosecutor operates , i 'd like to know a thing or two about it . 
  over here for example , the office of prosecutor can be ` steered ' in a certain direction by the minister of justice . 
  could this be the case in lithuania as well ? 
  i ca n't help but notice the long time gap between 1991 and the charges pressed as of 2015 . 
  it is not unreasonable to say that there 's a political element at play here , and maybe lithuania * could * ( not saying it should ) do best in just letting it go . 
  otherwise i can already hear that broken record in the background that claims the west is composed of hypocrites ( read : the accusation of hosting a political trial ) . 
  it is countereffective at best . 
  wait , wait :  50 % of the comments on immigration threads are just standard xenophobic rhetoric   like '' ** they 're all economic migrants ** '' , `` will destroy our culture '' , '' ** multiculturalism has failed ** '' , `` white race will die '' , `` keep importing more people '' , `` religion of peace '' , '' ** welfare shopping ** '' , '' ** first safe country ** '' you really believe that the arguments in bold have anything to do with xenophobia ? 
  they are actually valid arguments ( though the first one is a bit absolute , as ` all ' is a hyperbole ) among those that are n't radically left wing - as you seem to be . 
  now , that 's all fine with me - yet you should not assume to have any moral highground by making such generalizing statements . 
  to each his own . 
  it is stuff like this why you get downvoted : you often partake in labeling all criticism on immigration as the exclusive hobby of racists/supremacists , thus people abuse the downvote button again . 
  if you were to be a bit more nuanced , instead of a stereotype lefty that lets ideals trump reality , this would n't happen . 
  i agree : people should n't downvote out of spite , but you sure brought me very close to the downvote button by calling the things in bold above examples of xenophobia . 
  this is probably the most important comment in this entire post . 
  sure , there is agenda pushing as well , but this topic is in the news 24/7 . 
  of course it gets plenty of attention on this subreddit . 
  this is rather overreacted . 
  dozens of racists and other vile scum have been banned over the past week alone it seems , and the moderators are doing a pretty damn good job in keeping extremists out . 
  i just report them immediatly when i see something along the lines of ` kill all immigrants ' ( implied or just in plain text ) , and it gets removed pretty quickly together with all the other posts of said person in a topic . 
  this sub is still miles away from / r/european - fortunately . 
  the flurry of immigration posts can be avoided by adding a filter button , so that people uninterested in the topic can read other topics undisturbed . 
  it seems like it . 
  maybe you like [ this one ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/su0dg6fttdg/maxresdefault.jpg ) as well . 
  a partially impossible to change constitution that is considered to be pretty important , as well as history of course . 
  the influx of refugees into germany is therefore automatically bombarded as a ` test ' for those values , instead of discussing the long term implications of this subject . 
  edit : ah , / r/europe at its finest again . 
  if you disagree , hit the reply button and tell me why i 'm wrong . 
  the entire refuge ordeal in germany is pretty much forced into the corner of ideals , and whether those trump all other things . 
  there is way too little focus on the longterm in german media so far , at least compared to the attention the ` pro ' camp gets . 
  you sure are n't . 
  if treason would be as open ended as you 'd like it to be , a dystopic government is never far away . 
  in the same order :  that 's complete and utter nonsense . 
  do you seriously think that all foreigners are inherently dumber than a typical dutch teenager ? 
  no , i said they as a group are inherently ` dumber ' ( though i clearly dislike the term , let 's say ` less versatile ' ) than a similar group of dutch people . 
  i am doubting whether you tried to pull a strawman type of argument here , as i never said * all * of them are . 
  i will add that when saying this i have either african people or people from the middle-east in the back of my head - as they make up almost all of the migrants heading for europe at the moment . 
  living close to two major asylum centres , one of them mainly housing syrians ( around a thousand of them ) , i can clearly see how most of them are just the middle class of their country . 
  but their middle class is not the same as ours , and moreover is necessary to rebuild postwar syria . 
  if i look upon those people i do n't see any above average people walking among them , even though they as a group seem pretty civilized . 
  needless to say , my municipality has had little trouble with these people . 
   how much do you even remember of what you 've been taught in highschool ? 
  quite a bit , but let 's put this aside anyways . 
  this is not even of importance : you tried to claim that the money associated with giving a child a highschool education is in some way a waste of money or at least too expensive . 
  high school is a crucial part in one 's education , no matter where you go . 
  most importantly , years of lessons in dutch are n't easily compensated for by your average migrant . 
   no they wo n't and even if they will , this is an issue for everyone , not just refugees . 
  at this point we just differ from opinion . 
  i will remark that minister asscher claimed something similar some time back - and we do n't share the same political colour . 
  it becomes pretty evident if you know a lot of people from all age ranges * and * keep in mind what kind of work they actually do . 
  more and more people with somekind of general diploma are struggling with finding work , or keeping it . 
  what catches my eye is that mostly people with a mbo level of education or below are mostly caught up in this reality . 
  truth be told , when you get higher up in the system of education a study becomes more and more abstract , and less easy to automatize . 
  you can easily get rid of someone with a mbo administratief medewerker diploma and replace him/her by an automated system as of today already , and this will keep on increasing throughout the next two decades . 
  the same can not be said for a lawyer for example , or a doctor . 
  we agree on something though : this problem is an issue for everyone , but just like with the influx of moroccans , turks and surinamers these people will be at a disadvantage from day 1 , only to afterwards again make the pitfalls of previous generations . 
  they will be badly hit by this flow of automatization , as you can expect that most of them will perform easy , less complex tasks at work . 
  you look way too easily at it . 
  first of all , the level of knowledge of said migrants will always be below the average level of knowledge of say a regular dutchman . 
  of course , this can be remedied to some extent by throwing money at the problem but even then a noticable difference will always remain . 
  those 200k euros you talk about , or whatever it is exactly as of 2015 , are spent with good reason .
