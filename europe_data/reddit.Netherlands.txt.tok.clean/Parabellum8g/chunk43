  when that kid has grown up and joins the labor force he will probably ( depending on the level of education ) be able to perform a myriad of complex tasks , where the same will not apply to immigrants with little prior knowledge . 
  those people often form the smarter part of the population , sometimes even its elite , but even then they can hardly be called on par with the population here . 
  that is not strange : ever dutch kid enjoyed the benefits of a good system of education . 
  those people have n't , at least not as we know it . 
  it is rather weird to assume that many adult migrants would be able to just get a phd in chemistry if you accept that fact . 
  and at the same time i do n't even touch subjects like cost of proceedings and benefits given by the state during the time when these people can not fend for themselves , let alone whether there is * actual work * for them out there . 
  the trend has become clear : simple and easy to automatize jobs will become largely extinct in the next 20-30 years . 
  the long term problems associated with it are immense already , let alone that we have to deal with a group of naturalized former migrants in the future that will be severely offset by its effects . 
  thanks for adding this : ` ever aging ' is not the best way to describe the current situation . 
  a large future labor force will be needed to cope with the effects of population aging , of which the worst is yet to come . 
  also interesting to see how russia managed to stabilize its demographic situation : this could be a good case study for other countries in europe . 
   that 's the pragmatic argument . 
  as of 2015 , it is not . 
  almost every european country is still dealing with increased unemployment due to the crisis that struck europe over the past few years - the crisis that is still not completely over . 
  there is nothing pragmatic in pulling in thousands of people if they can not get off to work after having received a permit . 
   personally , i feel we have the obligation to take in refugees coming from the middle-east . 
  it 's the human thing to do . 
  i suspect you are actually looking for arguments like the economical one above out of * ideological * considerations , and not out of pragmatic convictions . 
  people do not need to die for me ( just to get this obvious thing clear ) , and once they 've reached europe they should be taken care of . 
  but the borders of europe need to be closed shut , as quickly as possible . 
  it wo n't make it impossible for illegal immigrants to reach europe , but after the success rate has dropped dramatically the influx will stop . 
  as pointed out countless of times before , there are multiple stops between the wealthy netherlands ( or germany ) and say syria . 
  therefore , we should indeed not talk of ` refugees ' by the time those people reach germany or some other wealthy eu nation : they are indeed economic migrants by the time they reach these places . 
  no one denies the hardships most of these people have gone through , but they have a responsibility to apply for asylum in the first safe country . 
  we should not - i repeat ** should not ** - facilitate the ever ongoing * braindrain * that has * crippled * the nations of origin from said migrants . 
  drawing out the local intelligentsia is a terrible idea : syria for example will need those people after the civil war there comes to pass . 
  their skills are needed there , not here . 
  i have and always will categorically reject this line of argumentation . 
  multiple european nations are facing problems connected to an ever aging population , yet stimulating couples to have children instead of punishing them in an economic sense is the way to go . 
  immigrants first need a lot of investing before they actually start to bring in money , and afterwards certain groups among them will still perform way below average compared to your average dutch citizen . 
  it is in no way true that this makes ` sense ' economically due to the cost associated with immigration and its after effects . 
  give financial benefits to those couples that have decided to have children and make sure that actually having a few is n't a financially unsound decision . 
  take measures such as state sponsored day care for children , so that both parents can still aspire to have a decent career - instead of just one parent or neither . 
  migration is not the only silver bullet to turn the ever decreasing birthrate in europe , nor does it make economical sense by definition . 
  thanks for the tireless efforts to keep this sub clean of ( closet ) extremists : we do n't need such people here . 
  is my impression correct that you guys got rid of quite a few of them over the past week or so ? 
  i am noticing less extremists and other vile people , that 's why . 
  working and relaxing ( in the same order ) . 
  probably i 'll mess up the sequence , or the proportion of work will be much smaller than the amount of relaxation . 
  the day probably ends with intoxication , as per usual during the weekends . 
  hehe , well countered  . 
  exciting . 
  i wonder if it contains any incriminating documents . 
  and of course any lost art treasures and other stolen possessions . 
   in this case the place was literally sinking and disintegrating a nice metaphore for italy at the time ? 
  ^ i 'll ^ see ^ ^ myself ^ ^ out ^ ^ ^ now . 
   plus i would like to be able to buy some weed now and again without resorting to a barter system i actually thought about this while reading the comments here . 
  one of my first thoughts was : ` people want to have cash to buy their drugs  , that must be it ! ' . 
  maybe reality will catch with politics in the years to come , but some people are already pretty spoiled . 
  if i want to buy weed here , i just walk into a ( cannabis ) coffeeshop and be done with it . 
  but of course , not everyone enjoys such a privilege . 
  a truly cashless society , that being one with complete oversight on financial flows , may be impossible to achieve . 
  but we 'll see how it pans out : both of us will know the answer in about 20-30 years . 
  maybe sooner than that . 
  by that time we 're the old people that used to pay with primitive round metal objects . 
  i regress : there should sufficient safeguards to deal with the downsides of such system , including judicial oversight . 
  i predict that technology will win the battle though , together with all the benefits a cashless society would offer to governments . 
  just imagine how much criminal money could be tracked down with such a system !, 
  the government could analyze cashflows of millions of entities ( maybe even fully automatic ) and pick out the one that seems a bit ` off ' . 
  about that bank : which one does that happen to be ? 
  i am curious . 
  that would be rather dystopic , but then again there 's the prediction that banks 20 years in the future will be more like giant it companies instead of banks as we know them today . 
  not that i think that the dutch government here would ever allow abn/ing/rabobank and all the other larger banks abuse their position like that . 
  the idea alone sends chills down my spine . 
  interesting observation about the use for bitcoin and similar initiatives : you are completely right about this . 
  or not . 
  it all boils down to legislation to curb the unwritten privileges of the rich and famous . 
  this may be more of a problem in the uk , where the elite is much more powerful and wealthy than say in the netherlands . 
  if you build a thorough system of taxation no one will be able to slip through . 
  it often goes wrong when politicians start tampering with a good draft and proceed with inserting things that destroy the system that was meticulously thought off by those who actually have the knowledge to build such a thing . 
  if politicians do their job there is no reason to assume that the ` super rich ' will be able to slip through . 
  tax havens are being closed in an ever increasing pace and such measures would fit in the trend that has already been set in years ago . 
   yes , because i voted for them . 
  because politicians * never lie , never tell half-truths and do n't actively engage in questionable policies * from time to time ? 
  i have always rejected this idea that the people - save its elite maybe - are directly responsible for all acts of their government . 
  you interpret democracy way too radically as the embodied will of the people . 
  that may be right in principle , but surely not in reality . 
  the american people are not to blame about an agency they indeed knew very little about until snowden his revelations . 
  it is wrong to say they are responsible about something that has never been subject of campaigning or public scrutiny . 
  respectfully , you should withdraw that statement . 
  it leads to blaming the people for the very worst of things as they 're assumed to be one cohesive unit . 
  as a german yourself , you know how flawed that type of reasoning is . 
  depends on whether the financial system renews the way it handles money - and of course how institutions like the fed and its european counterparts think about supervising large financial instutions . 
  the only thing you want is that your money is * safe * , and in a world where the most complicated control tasks increasingly venture out of the realm of sheer impossibility this will be do-able very soon . 
  also , there is much stricter legislation in place nowadays to prevent exactly what happened in greece for example . 
  not really a crazy idea : expect this to actually happen within 30 years from now . 
  i 've seen this coming for years already , but in the past society was n't ready for it yet ( as there have been some failed initiatives to stimulate full electronic payment ) . 
  at some point nation states will abolish ` cash ' in order to track down fraud , tax evasion and other things that costs your average state money . 
  expect hm revenue and customs to get a hard on about your proposal . 
  it will give tax authorities world wide sweeping powers to once and forever get rid of non-compliance to taxation regulation . 
  being deprived of oxygen and at the same time being poisoned by co2 can be a very treacherous process . 
  before you know it you ca n't think straight anymore and sort of wilfully undergo your fate . 
  this process would 've struck all people in the truck around the same time , so no one could observe other people falling down in a somewhat clear state of mind . 
  a dreadful way to go . 
  ** edit : ** this video deals with [ hypoxia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtnx6mr753w ) , but i think quite a bit of what was shown here also applied to that truck at some point . 
  it shows how insidious it can all be . 
   not a basement joke lol . 
  fritzl sure left an impact : that much can be concluded from the comments above . 
  indeed , that would be pointless . 
  good that you ask !,
