  there has been recent discussion about this within the judiciary , and i believe a life sentence was therefore even not given in a high profile case some months back . 
  even though that was based on speculation . 
  i for one do not agree with the echr , but of course its verdict needs to be observed . 
  it is quite possible that life imprisonment in the netherlands will be reformed in one way or another : there is also some political discussion about it . 
  there is a ( mostly ) theoretical chance of being pardoned by the king , but this has only happened once or twice the past 15 years , and in all cases the prisoner in question was terminally ill - thus the pardon was a gesture of mercy . 
  we 'll have to wait and see . 
  i have some rather radical ideas about this topic , as i believe that your average murderer should be put in prison for the rest of his life anyways given how murder is the most severe single crime one can commit . 
  my guess : there will be some kind of parole system here in the future . 
  oh , clearly . 
  which makes this agreement in itself indirectly illegal , but it does n't matter much . 
  by the time the echr comes to a verdict at least 5 ( probably 10 ) years will have passed , and this crisis will be long over . 
  countries like slovakia are all too aware of that fact . 
  they rather take the punishment somewhere down the line instead of having to give in now . 
  that i understand , but the thing is whether and agreement between the eu and a member state can be reviewed by the echr . 
  you are of course right that whenever a refugee applies for asylum in slovakia he or she can refer to article 14 of the convention . 
  i may be nitpicky here ( sorry for that ! ), 
  but the deal between eu member states itself can not be subject of review ( the european court of human rights only deals with cases between citizens and states ) . 
  it all depends on the nature of the complaint , that is what i tried to make clear . 
  in short : the echr does not have jurisdiction to strike down the agreement , but can punish slovakia for not living up to the convention . 
  did the eu already ascend to the echr treaty ? 
  i believe it has n't as of 2015 . 
  until then , the eu and the echr should be treated as two separate entities . 
  correct me if i am wrong though . 
  main point being : eu / = echr, 
  no , but one could ask himself what you have to do to actually ** get ** the maximum sentence . 
  some lithuanian guy in the netherlands that abused dozens of very young children ( the youngest victim being a few days old ) only got 18 years in prison , instead of the maximum of 20 years . 
  if you are responsible to the deaths of 58 people you should never be let loose in society again . 
  whether it is murder or manslaughter is of less importance . 
  of course * only * if the law allows for it ( which makes the previous a value judgement ) , of which i got a feeling uk law does n't . 
  in the netherlands , manslaughter without any aggrevating circumstances is punishable by a maximum of 15 years in prison for example . 
  murder on the other hand can result in a life sentence . 
  here this by default means life without any chance of parole . 
  lawyers sometimes speak of the ` levend-dood verklaring ' , or roughly translated ` living dead verdict ' , meaning that someone is basically dead for the rest of society , as prisonwalls will be the only thing such a person will see for the rest of his/her life . 
  that will always be the pickle , sadly enough . 
  lets see if the austrian police can first catch the driver , as he is directly responsible . 
  i share your cynical views on the prosecution of the big shots : they will probably remain untouchable . 
  the justice department in austria should surely try their best though . 
  between twenty and fifty dead apparantly , among them at least ten children . 
  i hope the smugglers in questions will receive life sentences for this massacre . 
  the latter of course being the very people that made a shitload of money out of the misery of others . 
  such disgusting and morally corrupt people that facilitate tragedies like this . 
  wow really ? 
  that entity is rather positively biased towards the west , and has more than once published a story that turned out to be founded on nothing or questionable premises !, 
  but even then it is just one single news agency . 
  as we say in dutch : ` een roepende in de woestijn ' , or roughly translated ' a screaming person in the desert ' . 
  not to say that there are none ( hence ` nearly non-existent ' ) : novaya gazeta could also be seen as independent , although i have little knowledge about how independent it is nowadays ( after a couple of high profile murders on its staff ) . 
  well since independent media are nearly non existent in russia anymore , outside sources like forbes is all what remains . 
  i would 've expected that a ~ ~ prestigious ~ ~ magazine like forbes goes the extra mile and checks facts , but apparantly that can not be expected . 
  ** edit : ** it really is not much more complicated than that . 
  i will add that forbes is not excusable for making such a mistake , but the people here that read it as fact are . 
  you would expect that a western media source would do its homework , especially one with such a name , but apparantly even journalists need to be double checked nowadays . 
  seems to make way more sense than a self censuring large newspaper . 
  also : people could expect that forbes would do at least some fact checking , but apparantly that was premature . 
  curious , as we are dealing with an influx of heavy weaponry from the very same area , mainly assault rifles . 
  thanks for the effort !, 
  same goes for / u/intelligentnickname, 
  would someone mind to give a rough translation ? 
  oh , personally i was simply referring to an old saying ( and not specifically to ` fun ' , i would n't describe it in that manner ) . 
  but war surely has been a hobby of the rich and powerful , down from the start of times . 
  the current strategic struggle that ensued after the ukrainian uprising/revolution fits in that narrative of ever wanting more ^ more ^ ^ more ... . 
  russia is only as threathened as russia thinks it is , and objectively there is no real credible threat for a country with a large nuclear arsenal . 
  always the same : normal , often poor people , pay the price for the ambitions of their leaders . 
  after all : war is the only exciting thing left for old , rich men . 
  apparantly the cost is deemed ` acceptable ' , as the entire conflict has n't ended yet . 
  god ... you 're like the stereotypical example of a dutchman . 
  rarely i say this , but today i am thoroughly ashamed of my country . 
  human rights suddenly are something that is expendable , obvious solutions that are actually morally justified are swept aside and of course the ever lasting fallacy called the ` money argument ' gets inserted again . 
  herp derp , it costs too much moneh !, 
  nevermind that it is in our ** best interest ** to lock down the eu and assist the libyan government . 
  but apparantly we have to follow some vague principles that are besides reality at this point . 
  i 'm out of this one . 
  the solution you propose is dead simple indeed . 
  the real solution is n't . 
  you ask to treat those people like animals and butcher them accordering to that philosophy . 
  the goal does n't always justify the means , especially when human rights are concerned . 
  you are n't the guy willing to take ` tough ' decisions : you fantasize about downright murder , all for the ` common good ' . 
  that is nothing but moral corruption - and above all a depraved way of thinking . 
  you want to end immigration ? 
  fine , lend your support for an eu military mission to libya . 
  the libyan government is too weak to properly secure its coastal areas , hence eu intervention will be required . 
  the libyan government will be all too happy to accept such aid . 
  i 'd reckon that this would even be cheaper than the upkeep of such a large naval force in the mediterrenean . 
  second : lend eu aid to bankrupt greece , in order to protect the fragile greek-turkish border . 
  if turkey does not want to comply in securing its coastal areas , current european naval forces south of italy could be better sent to the egeian sea to stem the influx of migrants there as well . 
  those that have already reached europe should be selected on the basis of proper procedures , of which the latter should result in the immediate deportation of economic migrants - back to their countries of origin . 
  true refugees should as a matter of common courtesy given asylum . 
   i 'm not sure why at this point we even let those refugees in . 
  just shoot the boats out of the water , refuse anyone appearing at a border crossing and shoot everyone trying to cross illegally . 
  simple . 
  shoot them with people inside , or when they are safely evacuated out of the boats ? 
  given the fact that you want to shoot people on sight berlin wall style i have a good idea of what you want though . 
  it really puzzles me why the anti-immigration debate so often gets hijacked by extremists that believe they ` add something ' by making such ridiculous , short sighted proposals . 
  you - do n't - help - us , that being the other people that like to see illegal immigration reduced or even come to a complete stop . 
  ` simple ' . 
  do n't make me laugh . 
   yes , but if you ever get into politics , you should be a man of your word quite on the contrary : it seems like politicians are by default those people with the most flexible ` morals ' . 
  nearly all politicians lie at some point , and many do it on a regular basis or limit themselves to telling halftruths . 
  maybe it is an occupational hazard , as not everyone can be satisfied after all . 
  i do n't like it though , same like you . 
  i 'll ask rutte to have a talk with angela .
