  that punitive expedition against greece will happen !, 
  beware of the german-dutch war machine heading your way , collecting all those sweet monies . 
  inspired by [ alex agnew ] ( https://youtu.be/fenppixtfde?t=63 )  ? 
  not at the moment : you should 've seen this topic a few hours back . 
  a lot has been removed as well . 
  the vote pattern fitted in what we 've seen in immigration topics so far . 
  there was even a guy below that admitted to using a shill account : he did n't even care about keeping it a secret . 
  whatever it is : i am not making it up here , just to score cheaply . 
  no way in hell . 
  no need to use disclaimers : i completely understand your position . 
  and you make a good point , which i 'll remember for the future . 
  it feels refreshing to actually have a decent exchange in opinion here again , on the backdrop of the increasingly aggressive tone of the comments . 
  remarkable how seldom such an exchange of opinion is still the case nowadays . 
  in the netherlands for example they are objectively as much as a problem as right wing extremists . 
  here you have the afa for instance ( meaning anti fascistische actie , loosely translated ` anti fascist movement ' ) that have a real reputation for demolishing stuff and committing violence in counter demonstrations . 
  then there 's the case of anarcho-left squatters that have committed a lot of violence throughout the years , often resulting in riot police needing to show up to quell public disorder . 
  the afa is even on the aivd ( dutch general intelligence service ) its watchlist . 
  i understand your point though and i 'll admit that right-wing extremism seems to be worse , at least in the way true right-wing extremists wish to change society and discriminate between people . 
  but as of 2015 , left-wing extremism in the netherlands is sadly most dangerous in terms of damage and disorder , even though it remains restricted to those two - instead of killings and other more terrible things . 
  apparantly the netherlands is n't alone in this : i 've kept quite a few comments of germans here on left wing extremism in germany in the back of my head as well . 
  edit : just saying , your distinction between thrashing things and thrashing people is still rather accurate . 
  i think it is a good way of distinguishing between the two , although it does not always apply . 
  shocking . 
  really shocking . 
  what makes it worse is that this solves literally nothing : it amounts to treating the symptoms , instead of finding a lasting solution for the countries of origin . 
  well you could 've at least made a bit more clear . 
  especially the second part , specifically ` right wing shitposters ' , was way too broadly phrased . 
  good to hear that you did n't mean to equate the entire right wing to this extremist minority . 
  in a way it is , as many people sort their comments based on comment karma , instead of new to old . 
  then there 's the issue of comments that get -5 or more will be automatically folded up ( by default settings ) and made invisible , unless one clicks on it . 
  i could n't care less about internet points , but the thing above is a problem . 
  overall , reddit would do best if it provides some kind of option to eliminate downvotes if the moderators of a subreddit choose for it . 
  the system gets abused anyways .

  - immigration topic comment rate : 100 % checks out again . 
  welcome to / r/europe . 
  enjoy your stay while it lasts . 
  for god sake , thank you for your comment !, 
  you ** exactly ** summarized my mood about / r/europe these days . 
  a place of extremes , where moderates are becoming a threathened minority . 
  yep . 
  they are constantly here in each and every immigration topic , ready to nuke any reasonable comment into oblivion . 
  funny how those people , that often care so much about free speech , do not seem to allow others to have the same . 
  please refrain from equating the right wing to right wing extremists . 
  i do the same regarding the left-wing and left wing extremists , of which the latter also has a habit of thrashing things . 
  you are overreacting , next to assuming a lot of things . 
  of course people should be able to criticize beliefs without fearing violent retaliation . 
  of course . 
  i am literally the last person on this subreddit that is against that . 
  what i did however is describe the downsides of it , as at some point that very subgroup of people i loathe will start overscreaming the rest . 
  it is a pattern i 've seen all across the internet , and it therefore is not a stretch to assume that the same will happen on / r/europe for example . 
  in the netherlands places like geenstijl.nl are a perfect case study of such behavior : it starts with a place where normal discourse is common , and at some point that slippery slope indeed sets in !, 
  now , 5 years later , the place has become an extremist , hateful pit of constant scorn . 
  honestly , a lot of people can not handle unlimited free speech . 
  before you know it hateful comments , downright death threats and other behavior that is punishable by law will occur in large numbers . 
  do you want to live in such a society ? 
  i do n't . 
  i still believe common courtesy should have some place as of 2015 - and it seems to become more and more the exception . 
  ** edit : ** in summary , what i ask for is that things like slander , hatespeech , making threats etc. 
  will always remain punishable by law and also morally seen as ` wrong ' . 
  i am not asking for a limitation for criticizing religion or immigration or whatever topic that can easily be discussed by grown ups . 
  maybe the netherlands is way too easy to use for reference , as we can criticize just about everything without problem , but i 'd be surprised if many if any european nations out there persecute people for criticizing a religion ( for example of course islam ) or immigration . 
  again : it really is overreacted and a grab for attention . 
  interesting . 
  seems like the rule of law does n't seem a good idea to everyone anymore nowadays . 
  i think it will rather result in a split . 
  most people still think in yes/no , black and white scenarios , thus there a larger group will come into existence that is moves from doubts about immigration to downright opposing it . 
  another group will be guilt tricked due to germany its history and move to the pro-immigration camp . 
  whatever it is , violence is ** never the answer ** . 
  those people that did this hijack the immigration debate and damage those that ask for more stringent immigration rules . 
  what i think is that we should not believe that at any point the number of immigrants should go down because of * fear for a group of extremists * . 
  the law will always need to be obeyed to prevent chaos and/or bloodshed , and no single government in the world needs to give way to criminals . 
  not exactly ` the way ' to make a point ( / s ) against immigration . 
  sadly i have noticed this before , concerning the topic freedom of speech : people ask for unlimited freedom of speech , because they feel restrained , and in no time discrimination , threats and other downright illegal stuff becomes common good . 
  because of the existence of such people the pro-immigration reflex will only get more rigid . 
  merkel 's catch all that people that are against immigration have ` cold hearts ' will only gain more ground because of the scum that perpetrated this . 
  a shame ( as it is nothing but stereotyping ) , but the direct result of incidents like these . 
  edit : ah , stormfront appeared again . 
  will the sane part of / r/europe balance me out ? 
  thank you very much . 
  to ensure that large parts of the populace do n't get insane due to impossible to answer existential questions . 
  that is just how it works . 
  you hit the nail on the head . 
  thanks for stating the obvious . 
  also , there are more countries in the region , so do n't try to score cheaply . 
  there are multiple countries around syria and libya that could host such refugees , if necessary with increased un aid . 
  the eu . 
  i do n't believe the larger schengen area can muster the political will for financial aid . 
  easy there . 
  nobody suggests anything about killing or injuring entire families , so do n't frame it into that direction . 
  send them back to other countries in the region , especially the ones they passed through first . 
  in the case of syria that would be turkey/lebanon . 
  in the case of libya either algeria , or egypt or tunisia . 
  they have to apply for asylum in the first safe nation they pass through anyways . 
  people that are already in europe should of course be divided over the member states , and procedures should be as short yet delicate as possible , to ensure this entire wave of immigrants does not change into a possible long term societal problem . 
  it is in the interest of opponents and proponents of immigration to be done with it as quickly as humanely possible . 
  europe got a responsibility to stabilize the region , which includes libya . 
  last time i checked there were even plans to send about 10.000 soldiers to aid the current libyan government , so the political will for such peacekeeping mission is not that far fetched . 
  after all we got a responsibility to clean up the mess in libya , but your method of paying for our ` guilt ' by taking in hundreds of thousands of people is not the way to go . 
  above all , it does not solve the problem .
