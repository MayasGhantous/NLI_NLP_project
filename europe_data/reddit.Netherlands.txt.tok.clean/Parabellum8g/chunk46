  accepting tens of thousands of people is treating the symptoms , instead of battling the source . 
  precisely , hence the need for eu assistance ( which is already being given by the way , but could be expanded if necessary ) . 
  immigration is a european problem after all : we 've all seen the numbers of migrants trying to apply for asylum in germany or sweden . 
  western and northern european eu member states have a lot of self interest in preventing that these people manage to each europe . 
  i dare to say that it would be much cheaper for germany to fund greece its border defence instead of having to take in all those refugees and economic migrants . 
  the nos is leftwing biased alright , but quoting dumpert of all places ( indirectly you are quoting geenstijl.nl ) is self-defeating . 
  geenstijl gots it 's own agenda and is heavily biased to the right as well . 
  i second that . 
  it really is a sensationalist rag . 
  i hope the scum responsible to this hidious crime receives life sentences . 
  moreover , there should be a deep inquiry into the motivations of the attackers . 
  it is a complicated situation , that we should all admit , but to think that is impossible for a sovereign state to properly lock down its own borders is a bit too much for me . 
  as long as you pour sufficient funds into it , border control can get near watertight . 
  the second thing you described is more of a problem : greece of course can not let those people drown in the sea which makes it necessary to pick them up and bring them ashore . 
  since turkey apparantly does n't really bother as well , greece will be forced to set up a functioning system that is capable of processing hundreds of thousands of people and quickly sending them back . 
  people that do stuff like you described here should be sent back immediatly , no further questions asked . 
  i would n't be surprised if there is enough legal backing for it in international law . 
  most importantly : we both know that the flow will not stop as long as people can actually succesfully apply for asylum on the other side of europe . 
  * make the succes rate drop * to below 5 % , and the flow will dry up in the upcoming years . 
   what are we supposed to do if they want to go on and walk all the way to northern europe ? 
  stop them from reaching greek territory in the first place . 
  i know , this is a bit unfair because of the large influx of migrants/refugees and the financial peril the greek government finds itself in , but it really seems like the greek border is leak from all sides . 
  the remaining 160.000 sadly should be processed in greece ( with aid from the eu if necessary ) and those that are n't real refugees should be sent back by the greek authorities . 
  but i regress : financial aid will be needed from the eu to make greece do this effectively . 
  fortunately the eu has already made a [ start ] ( http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150810/1025591057.html ) in helping out . 
  it is not that hard , as the police will be restricted in the way they act as well . 
  they ca n't just fire rubber bullets - or even real bullets - at a crowd of seemingly normal people . 
  that crowd also consists of children by the way . 
  another major factor in this is macedonia 's desire to join the eu somewhere down the line , so it does n't want to end up on brussels ' list of human rights violators . 
  not to say that macedonia is without any controversy with regard to that topic , but opening fire on a group of unarmed refugees is probably a bad idea . 
  especially when camera 's are nearby . 
  and of course it would be morally completely wrong to do something similar . 
  this was the first thing i thought of after reading this story !, 
  oh well , guess there are worse ways to die than this . 
  day-ah and way-ah are of course pronounced in a very james hetfield like way right  ? 
  close one . 
  fortunately those soldiers were there . 
  they deserve a freaking medal for this . 
  yup , murica to the rescue again . 
  edit : and glorious britannica of course . 
  everything is do-able if a proper budget is assigned . 
  europe can easily be locked down if border control agencies have enough manpower on their hands . 
  it all boils down to funds , and political will . 
  well , i 'd rather not interfere in this heated debate , but isis can really be summarized as ` orthodox ' sunni muslims . 
  they interpret what they read literally , which in turn results in savage punishments for example . 
  the quran is pretty graphic in the way it describes things , even much more terrible than the sadomasochistic god that features in the thorah or the hypocrite in the new testament . 
  apparantly they even used stun grenades ( flashbangs ) to keep the mob under control . 
  hundreds of them crossed the border anyways though . 
  i do n't know for certain : for a long time we were extremely proud on our ` tolerance ' , yet nowadays tolerance has come to symbolize a type of indifference , instead of some form of acceptance . 
  it might have been always like that , although it is hard to say for certain . 
  i 'd say this : people should always judge each other as individuals and do see without and reservations . 
  traditions - as well as an appeal to tradition - is seldom an argument i approve of , as it omits to explain * why * we should follow a certain way . 
  historically , religious freedom in the netherlands for example only extended to christians ( calvinists vs catholics for example ) and tolerance in itself was more used in a context of societies that are rather similar to one another . 
  you feel it coming already : european societies differ wildly from those in the middle-east and northern africa . 
  of course this results in friction , and there should be some way to mediate it without creating the situation we find ourselves in at the moment . 
  i admit that assimiliation may be controversial , but you 're talking to someone that has become extremely cynical about ` integration ' as a method . 
  it just does not work good enough to keep using it . 
  yes , it is rather ideological , though i 'll commend you for being fair about it . 
  we had exactly the same approach here until 2005 or so ; after that procedures became way more strict , especially with regard to language requirements and general knowledge about the netherlands people need to ascertain before becoming a citizen . 
  the best way is to softly force people to give up their roots , at least concerning how they behave in public life . 
  that passport , whether french or dutch , * means * something , and people should behave according to the values associated with said countries . 
  in short : people from abroad should become full fledged citizens of their new country , instead of an uneasy go in between . 
  i have met plenty of turkish and moroccan ` dutch ' citizens that always have their left foot in the netherlands and their right foot in either turkey or morocco . 
  they belong to no nation , and are n't really accepted by both societies . 
  it is really not desirable and thus should end . 
  that is all there is to it . 
  all the economic migrants can be sent back after a proper procedure , while the true refugees should be given a temporary permit . 
  at least : that is for that people that already ** are ** in europe . 
  those that are outside of europe still should be taken care of closer to home . 
  at the same time , the borders of europe need to be properly locked down , to prevent a stroke of the asylum system . 
  if france wants to salvage itself after all the misery regarding immigration , it should go full assimilation . 
  the same goes for my country , to properly end the divide that so many european nations encounter in their societies . 
  integration has failed . 
  it is best to acknowledge that sooner than later , so that the real problem solving can start as quickly as possible . 
  thirty to fourty years of failed integration attempts does have some weight . 
  that is one way of dealing with feeling powerless . 
  all symbolic of course : it hurts the russian people the most after all . 
  and that guy in the wide coat reminded me of [ this character ] ( http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/images/reviews/1/1193343144_3.jpg ) . 
  rather cold response i 'd say . 
  but let 's take it with a grain of salt as it is an internet poll after all . 
  the conflicting explanations here are confusing though . 
  in other words : the guy just told a straight out lie ? 
  way to go to make a point lol . 
  by doing so he actually ensured that a pro-immigration stance again gets associated with downright lies to the people , which in turn will polarize the situation even more . 
  also rather lazy of politico to not properly factcheck his statement . 
  i would 've read the poll if i knew any czech , yet i do n't . 
  if there 's someone that actually does master the language , please do me a favor and find the poll + translate the questions . 
  i think it is very important for this post that this statistic gets confirmed as true or false . 
  and this sentiment is something i ca n't respect * if * it is true . 
  people that downright refuse a little bit of humanitarian help for children that have become victim of war deserve no respect . 
  or do you think otherwise ? 
  probably the czech equivalent of geenstijl.nl . 
  the latter is about the same in terms of influence , and has also evolved from a place of free speech and discourse to a cesspit of discrimination and downright racism . 
  where you could have a decent discussion down there 5 years back , nowadays you would only get overshouted by the dominant group there . 
  the group that of course thinks its always right and uses strawman like tactics in just about every response to a reasonable comment . 
   the czech republic recently decided to accept 15 sick syrian children for treatment in czech hospitals . 
  remarkably , in an internet poll attached to a newspaper article reporting on the story , 83 percent of readers disagreed with the decision . 
  pretty sick statistic . 
  they are fucking children : what the hell is wrong with people ? 
  ** edit ** : some people say the outcome of the poll belongs to a different question .
