  people think that the word ` sovereignty ' is a silver bullet that can end any discussion , while failing to see that pulling the sovereignty card out of good faith - and on a regular basis - will kill international relations instantly . 
  moreover , it is not how it works in practice . 
   meanwhile everyone blames the eu for illegal immigration , which is stupendous because people do n't know that its ' their national parliaments who are responsible . 
  not the eu . 
  not here to be precise : i mostly notice people blaming only the migrants that move this place and are expecting some kind of paradise on earth in europe . 
  next to that , the newspapers here are focussed on the impossible challenge of italy and greece , of which the last state can not possibly stem the flow of migrants . 
  we both know that greece does not have additional funds to properly seal its borders , which makes it a european problem from that point onwards . 
  the same applies to italy : the triton mission is the direct result of italy not having the funds or manpower to keep migrants out of european territory . 
  italy has been even purposely let migrants cross their borders into france and other nations , just to get rid of the burden . 
  at that point it just becomes a european problem , whether you like it or not . 
  i honestly do not care ** at all ** if each individual nation in the eu has to pay up to properly seal down europe , until the border nations can deal with migrants on their own . 
  let it be perfectly clear that i certainly do not want to see these numbers of migrants entering the eu , but the problem has to be solved someway or another . 
  responsibility is the keyword here . 
  if you are referring to the idea that one nation can not forcefully intervene in the internal affairs of another : this has already been impossible for like 350 years or so , since the peace of westphalia . 
  i 'll give you a relative example that will make you understand it though : you , as the representative of slovakia , and me , as the representative of the netherlands , engage in a mutual contract . 
  we decide that i will deliver 10 state of the art warships , while you will oblige yourself to pay the sum of 10 billion euros . 
  the treaty itself has been signed by both governments . 
  moments after the ships enter slovakian waters , you start mumbling about how the dutch have never respected slovakia ( making this up of course ) and conclude that you only need to pay my nation 5 billion euro 's . 
  now you might think that pulling the ` meh sovereignty-card ' might be enough to prevent paying the other 5 billion , but that is not how it works . 
  slovakia would be obliged to pay the remaining 5 billion under international law as you did not live up to your obligations . 
  in the end , we could even go to the icj to resolve the matter or some other court of arbitrage . 
  you are right that sovereignty prevents my nation from simply seizing the remaining 5 billion in slovakia ( by force for example ) , yet this move will ensure that slovakia will never be able to engage in international trade again - at least not between states . 
  that is just how it works in practice : the same pattern you might have noticed with the french-russian weapons deal , where russia held france to its obligations . 
  france buckled and has indeed decided to pay back . 
  what we are really talking about here is how a state can be forced to comply when it fails to uphold treaties it has bound itself to . 
  international law in practice has a real status , especially in these fields , and states will do everything to prevent being seen as ` non-compliant ' in cases like this . 
  you probably also noticed the comment that this move by slovakia is ` non-discriminatory ' as muslims would not ` feel at home ' in slovakia . 
  this could very well be true by the way , but the government just said that to cover itself legally . 
  even then it is not enough . 
  it really is plain and simple : when you oblige yourself to a certain deal , you have to keep your word . 
  if you do n't , you 'll pay damages or face other repercussions . 
  in this case the repercussions will probably be found in future cuts in eu funds directed to slovakia . 
  i read the article . 
  now i 'll explain to you where you took a wrong turn . 
  ready for it ? 
  and by that i mean are you really willing to listen and take into account how it works in the legal world ? 
  the eu relocation plan is indeed voluntary ( so far ) , given the form of the current plan . 
  the thing is , at the moment some non-christian guy would show up on slovakian territory , this type of differing between persons is not allowed under international treaties . 
  you have to understand that there are multiple treaties regulating * how * slovakia , my nation and any other nations party to that treaty are obligated to act . 
  in that sense , you can not ` refuse ' someone just on the basis of his/her religion . 
  i have a serious dislike for islam , but that does n't mean that the rule of law still does n't apply . 
  even during this agreement with the eu , other international legislation still applies . 
  so yes , to get back to the options , slovakia got roughly two options : - take all , without making a distinction on the basis of religion/place of birth of whatever other way ; - take none . 
  if this really is so much of a problem , i guess the other nations that are already shouldering ** by far most of the burden ** can take in the measly few slovakia is making a fuss about . 
  effectively , this means shifting the problem to other european nations which makes this a rather hostile move , while the entire immigration problem is a european issue . 
  even then , taking none would be the only solution on the table for slovakia . 
  i will immediatly add that such behavior should have backroom repercussions , including the allocation of the eu funds . 
  ganymede , please stop making a fool out of yourself . 
  it hurts my legal brain to see you utter nonsense like this , and i just ask you to listen for the duration of this comment : slovakia is * bound * to international treaties that have to do with the right to asylum and the corresponding procedures . 
  that means slovakia * obliged * itself to live up to those obligations . 
  if you want that to end , slovakia must pull back out of the treaties mediating this topic . 
  treaties trump national law , that is how it works legally . 
  any other interpretation to that - that being non-legal views on this topic - is worthless . 
  what you are proposing is not living up to the law , even if that means international law . 
  / u/lustschloss already explained this - and it is the only answer to this situation , thus he 's actually making a lot of sense . 
  slovakia is a state of law , and thus ideas like this have no place as of 2015 . 
  again : if you want it to change , slovakia must pull back out of those treaties . 
  until then , it must keep its word like any honest person would . 
  there is no alternative to that , otherwise international relations would be impossible . 
  you nailed it . 
  i do n't think that 's relevant , for multiple reasons . 
  first and foremost , the death penalty is something that is considered horribly outdated and cruel among european nations , which will of course play a major role here . 
  i think it is a major mistake to equate / r/europe to the peoples ( and governments ) of your average european nation . 
  if you were sarcastic , do n't mind the former though . 
  keywords here are ` temporary ' and ` suspect ' . 
  i 'm surely ** no ** fan of the swedish system with regard to immigration , but next to the obligation to do a proper inquiry there is n't much to report here . 
  i wonder if sweden could actually come back on this decision after all , given that such decisions will always be bound by laws . 
  clearly no one with a bit of legal knowledge would be surprised if sweden finds itself in a legal bind at the moment . 
   he pointed out that the people in question have not been sent back to their country because they risk getting killed or tortured , and `` some '' have been given temporary residence permits . 
  something that seems understandable , yet sweden should hand them over to the icc if possible . 
  otherwise a trial in sweden should take place , followed by an expulsion for those proven guilty . 
  it would be a bit too ridiculous for me if sweden becomes a safe haven for such people . 
  well , i could try after all  . 
  i could n't exclude that he was right , but his silence is telling . 
  source ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/female-genital-mutilation/pages/introduction.aspx ) seems to suggest that it is n't that dramatic by far . 
  it remains a barbaric practice though . 
  you got me there . 
  it 's easy to forget about former colonies  . 
  though next to french guyana , french would be useless in dominantly spanish/portuguese south america . 
  but yeah , you 're right about guyana . 
   you are 47.8 % european , and you scored closest to netherlands , with a similarity of 60.5 % !, 
  lol , fuck the ` logic ' of this poll . 
  they might as well have wasted valuable pixels on a horoscope compared to this nonsense . 
  rather ironic that the poll guessed i was dutch , while i exhibit few of the traits of your average dutchman . 
  i hope so . 
  i just wondered whether is meant to sent some kind of double message . 
  but it 's probably because they speak in a type of religious gibberish , not because they necessarily meant something else as well . 
  nice picture . 
  yeah , thought about that last part as well . 
  also , could you expand a bit on the relations between the current government of turkey and is ? 
  treason in itself can be described as not being loyal/faithful to the other . 
  does this also in any way confirm the ( prior ) existence of informal ties between the turkish government and is ? 
  there 's been quite a bit of talk about that over the past year and i wonder whether there has been some direct contact between is and the turkish government ( i.e. 
  mainly concerning a laissez faire approach towards one another ) . 
  completely depends on your plans . 
  as you stated , you are looking for a useful language for travelling across europe * and * the world . 
  basically , you are looking for a lingua franca next to english . 
  german is pretty useless outside of europe , where french is much more useful ( canada , vast parts of africa , etc ) . 
  spanish in itself is extremely useful in the americas , as is portuguese .
