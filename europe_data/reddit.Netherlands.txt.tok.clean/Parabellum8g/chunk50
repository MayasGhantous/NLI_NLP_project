  it all depends on * where * you want to go . 
  as long as you have vague ideas about it , it might be best to just stick to english to prevent learning a language that might not be useful ( i.e. 
  learning french while travelling to south america for example ) . 
  if you want to stay closer to home ( which might be a better idea ) and have no plans to leave europe , i think german might actually be the most useful language . 
  it is widely used as a language of commerce in the countries directly surrounding it . 
  again : what matters is where you go to  . 
  i believe the latter had to do with him taking on the role of supreme mod some time back , a decision i actually welcomed even though i was aware of his ` tendencies ' from time to time . 
  it seemed like a good call as there was some need for a decision making entity within the mod team , but the choice of person turned out to be pretty bad . 
  well there might be an issue with it : is n't it possible to hide previous posts , at least those that were posted on other subreddits ? 
  the people that are deadset on influencing this sub with their brigading and agenda pushing will surely find ways to circumvent the rules . 
  i just do n't want to see you guys forced back into the nonsolution of megatopics , nor do i want to see the moderator workload ( which is high as it is ) increase . 
  do you have anymore details about this ? 
  i missed it . 
  indeed : this also smells like a throwaway account . 
  you guys could consider setting a few minimum requirements in order to post about immigration topics , to lessen the amount of agenda pushing . 
  for example : - an account that is 3 months old , or even 6 months old , to prevent the use of throwaway accounts ; - a minimum requirement of 200 linkkarma and say 500-1000 comment karma as a second requirement . 
  immigration in my eyes is still a problem that is rather downplayed on the european level and moreover , by certain political parties . 
  we should be able to discuss about this huge challenge for europe , yet without the subtle interference of extremists out there . 
  those people are n't welcome here , as has been stated before . 
  edit : there 's the brigade again . 
  this subreddit really is under attack , that much has been shown again . 
  there is n't even an attempt to hide it , at least so it seems . 
  the fact that this gets downvoted shows that these persons fear such measures . 
  therefore i hope they 'll get implemented  . 
  no one does not exist , mostly . 
  the same goes for everyone , always , never and other words of absolute meaning - at least most of the time . 
  what i notice is that you get extremely emotional about this change of events and i wonder why . 
  you must be fearing some grave event or something . 
  like this sub turning into some neo-stormfront gathering . 
  those people will be kept out by the people that have kept this place clean for years already , and that have done so properly throughout the past few months despite their limited manpower . 
  to directly challenge your statement ` no one is actually advocating this ' ( that being , no one is advocating that europe should be a safe haven for each and all ) : i have seen my share of leftist oriented people in life that believe in ** exactly ** such things . 
  not to say that i have anything against people that are leftwing oriented : i often find them more empathic than your average rightwinger , which is a bit painful to admit from someone that would probably be placed somewhere on the right side of the spectrum . 
  even though i immediatly remark that i despise the left/right wing dogma , yet you get kind of forced into it . 
  given the highly emotional nature of this ` discussion ' - or whatever is left of it - i will retire . 
  i take it you 'll respect my opinion , right ? 
  then i 'll find the place in my heart to respect yours . 
  ** edit ** : and there 's your downvote  . 
  well done complaining about being downvoted , while not upholding the same values yourself . 
  jesus christ man , do n't be so extremely salty about it . 
  of course the ` entire impoverished part of the world ' is a hyperbole : a means for me to express that i believe we should n't use our limited resources to heal the entire world . 
  europe is still recovering from the largest and most widespread economic crisis of the past 80 years : we just can not bring in everyone and turn europe into a safe haven for each and all . 
  no , our focus should be on stabilizing our backyard , which includes northern africa and syria . 
  attack the problem at its root , instead of dealing with the symptomes . 
  our door should always be open to people in need of shelter , but not to those that seek economic opportunity . 
  to the latter i am quite clear : they have * nothing * to look for here . 
  this is no ` hysteria ' but a rather cold appreciation of what we can do as of 2015 , and what we ca n't . 
  i know that ideology can make you think otherwise - and think that everything is possible . 
  at some point in time a sobering thought will sink in that not all is possible , nor desirable in the long term . 
  call me a pragmatic cynic , but i stay far away from anything that is set in stone , including all the various - isms out there . 
  very heroic of yours , using a throw away account that is about 2 hours old  . 
  edit : wow , the brigading is real . 
  nothing is obvious , save what you perceive that way . 
  of course the guidelines above could be made more stringent for moderator comfort . 
  for example : a minimum requirement of 200 link karma and an account being 6 months or older in order to post a topic , to prevent ` throw away accounts ' being used to still push a collective agenda . 
  a healthy distribution of subjects means that issues that are very alive in society should get the chance to be debated . 
  that chance was taken away the past few weeks concerning this topic ( and no , do n't you dare argue that the hated megaposts allowed for discourse ! ), 
  and subsequently restored today . 
  for me , today , reason has prevailed . 
  and really , given the limited resources that europe has to shelter just about the entire impovirished part of the world , i understand that pro-immigration ideas are pretty impopular . 
  a pro immigration stance is impopular for good reason , although it indeed should n't result in mass downvoting . 
  then again , as i argued elsewhere in this post , this is the result of the meta failure of the downvote/upvote system . 
  the problem is that what you describe is rather innate to reddit instead of / r/europe . 
  granted , the people that read a certain subreddit can wildly differ from another subreddit ( and the subjects they consider ` more important ' ) , yet what you basically complain about is the meta failure of the upvote/downvote system . 
  downvotes should be removed using an overlay or something , to at least limit the number of downvotes issued out of revenge or sheer disagreement . 
  i think / r/europe would be a better place for discourse if such a change would be made . 
  and true thrash comments ( for example discriminatory comments , respectless ad hominem behavior that lowers the standard , etc ) can be removed by using the ` report ' button anyways . 
  the thing is that it seemingly differs by culture . 
  i can remember an argument i had with a german guy some time back , in which he started to say that not respecting someone else his/her culture , or his/her religion , amounts to racism . 
  and that was n't the only person : a lot of people all across europe seem to interpret that infamous word in varying ways . 
  as for me : i limit its definition to discriminating someone on the basis of his/her skin colour or nationality . 
  and i even consider the latter part a bit too vague to use in a credible manner , as it is hard in itself to divide people in ` races ' on the basis of nationality in the 21st century . 
  the entire word is backwards really , and kind of self defeating when using it to shut someone up - as it makes you reaffirm the existence of ` races ' in the first place . 
  better to use discrimination as an umbrella term if you ask me . 
  excellent solution : this is what we needed weeks back ago when the megatopics regarding immigration began !, 
  it ensures a healthy distribution of subjects across this subreddit , without too much particular attention to one certain thing . 
  i applaud the mods for making this correct move : well done . 
  it also removes this topic out of the realm of extremism in which it was kind of ( forcefully ) pushed in the last few weeks . 
  edit : about the change in mods , why did / u/theskynet leave the moderator team ? 
  i only just noticed . 
  the fact that you need to attack me personally - and use some kind of strawman argument - is one thing . 
  the other fact , that being that it actually gets upvoted , says something about the state of this subreddit . 
  just for later reference :  i know , i know , you 're from a tiny country , you ca n't know that apparantly this ** smug ** ad hominem attack gets tolerated on this subreddit . 
  seeing this makes me sad , and it emphasizes how / r/europe has taken a turn for the worse with each and every new subscriber . 
  i could of course strike back in the same manner , but at least i realize it does n't help anyone . 
  that knowledge is enough for me . 
  edit : indeed , this says enough again . 
  apparantly the f35a is expected to cost $ 85 million dollars in a few years time , where the rafale costs roughly $ 70m ( depending on the variant ) . 
  the eurofighter is rather expensive at $ 90 m , and the gripen costs little over $ 70 m a piece . 
  still a point to be made though : it clearly is cheaper than the eurofighter . 
  the thing is that it could be more expensive if there are any further delays or unseen obstacles , but i guess the same could be said about the other three planes as well . 
  you 're right , even though the f35 was at first projected to be a lot cheaper than it is nowadays . 
  correct . 
  i even remember the headlines a few months ago about the franco-egyptian weapons deal ( and the controversy associated with it ) . 
  that does n't mean the rafale program is a sudden succes , but maybe i am too quick to condemn the rafale program as having failed . 
  the rafale has been around for a long time though , and developing a fighter is no cheap undertaking . 
  from a business point of view , the rafale is n't really succesful . 
  the eurofighter has performed much better to date . 
  way more than we can ` afford ' to pay apparantly . 
  i believe we 're ordering 37 , which is way too little . 
  the jsf program was a costly adventure in which we should not have participated ( i 'd rather have seen airbus build a next gen fighter together with some other european countries , one that could even surpass the eurofighter ) .
