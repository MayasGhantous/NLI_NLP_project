  to say that it ` clogs up ' the frontpage is nonsense however . 
  there are other ways to combat the flood of posts concerning immigration . 
  also : do n't forget that european nations have drastically increased their refugee intake as of late , so more topics about it can be expected ( as it causes turmoil in society ! ) . 
  i do n't care about ones political convictions , unless we would be talking about the political extremes . 
  but mods should go to great lengths to even prevent being seen as no longer impartial . 
  which reminds me of how similar moderators are to professional judges - and how great the responsibility that rests on them is . 
  exactly . 
  it suggests that one got something to hide , which will only exacerbate the already fierce debate around this topic . 
  and the same approach continues , though i did n't expect much less after yesterday 's topic . 
  i mean : i take it that the mods had a long an dull argument about this course of action , which makes this rather predictable . 
  i think a lot of people posted valid arguments * against * making topics like these , as it by default pushes any debate regarding immigration into some kind of extremist corner . 
  this undertone , this idea that the mods need to hoard the / r/europe userbase into topics like these is what i consider the most repulsive . 
  basically , * some * moderators are preventing any in depth debate about an important topic in dozens of european nations , as megathreads like these bury submissions like no other . 
  you present us with a list of links , while many people may not be interested into reading the majority of them . 
  still , you kind of coerce them to read it all as you ** force ** them to partake in a meta discussion , instead of giving them the chance to comment on individual posts . 
  if this is the result of still being understaffed : time to draw in * more * moderators then . 
  this is not the way to fix it . 
  ** edit ** : also , what the hell is up with contest mode ? 
  either apply it all over / r/europe , or nowhere . 
  this feels like some manipulation move . 
  ** edit 2 ** : well done removing contest mode . 
  the former still applies : use it everywhere on / r/europe , or nowhere  . 
  always the same cowards that beat up someone in overwhelming numbers . 
  i have difficulty expressing how much i loathe scum like this . 
  the most horrid punishments come to mind again for these savages , but then again it is best to let go of such vengeful thoughts . 
  oh god , the flip side of principles is being shown again . 
  what do we know ? 
  cows are dying of thirst ( and heat ? ), 
  somewhere in swiss ; 2 . 
  permission was asked ; 3 . 
  the water was needed and probably the only source nearby . 
  all these things combined result in a reasonable course of action . 
  what happens ? 
  there is fuss about something completely reasonable because the swiss did n't use the * proper * channels . 
  if the swiss started a military exercise into french terroritory the situation would 've been different , yet no such thing ( or anything comparable to it ) happened . 
  really weird this is ' a problem ' down there . 
  indeed !, 
  i was actually looking for that video in this topic , as the transavia plane was in serious trouble . 
  a flapless landing brings about a whole range of added risks , which makes this landing way more impressive . 
  anyone reading this should watch [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nio38kxye-i ) . 
  apparantly the jet already aborted 3 landings and was running short on fuel , before the captain decided to make a go for it . 
  and no the video was n't accelerated : the plane actually came in this fast . 
  apparantly it is rooted in tradition there to negotiate with people that behave in a criminal manner . 
  at least : it is n't the first time this type of extreme ` protesting ' ( let 's just call it vandalism with a political goal ) takes place , and the government giving in ( thus rewarding the very same behavior ) is n't a new thing as well . 
  it might be me , but public order always ** trumps ** individual needs . 
  especially when crimes like vandalism and arson are being committed negotiating should be no option at all . 
  just look at [ this ] ( http://nos.nl/video/2048686-boeren-plunderen-vrachtwagen.html ) again : no way that this would ever be tolerated in the netherlands . 
  said persons would 've been handcuffed and sent to jail , as it is the proper course of action . 
  no idea why hollande indeed shows such respect to the criminal actions that accompanied these protests . 
  as the leader of france he got a heavy responsibility to ensure public order will be maintained . 
  edit : to those interested : [ another image of french farmers/peasants looting a foreign truck ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2048657-franse-boeren-plunderen-nederlandse-vrachtwagen.html ) . 
  read again :  that includes if he decides to not share the beliefs of his parents , * which is a distinct option * . 
  the singular fact that it worked out perfectly for you does not in any way mean that this is the case for everyone . 
  if you use yourself as a statistic study ( n = 1 ) in itself you are making a dreadful mistake . 
  no shit that you enjoy being circumcised : many people will accept it at some point as it ca n't be turned back . 
  some will never be bothered by it , others will be though . 
  those people deserve a choice . 
  you downright ** deny ** them that choice , at least that is what can be concluded so far . 
  oh i understand it alright : i just condemn it as downright medieval . 
  with good reason : a child can not choose , yet will be forced to witness the consequences of this ` improvement ' for the rest of his life . 
  that includes if he decides to not share the beliefs of his parents , which is a distinct option . 
  parents simply do n't have the right to do this without a clear medical cause . 
  if you really want to crusade against that , then well , you are no different in my eyes . 
  just another butcher really . 
  amazing we still have this discussion as of 2015 . 
  a child ** can not decide ** about wanting to be mutilated out of religious considerations before reaching adult age . 
  this nonsense should be universally banned today , save for clear medical reasons . 
  and the parents that do this are n't real parents in my eyes . 
  more like highly selfish beings . 
  sigh ... [ there you go ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battery_ ( crime ) buddy . 
  i think / u/xeran _ at least summarized the root of the problem correctly here , as many of their businesses would n't even be able to turn a profit without eu assistance . 
  whatever resulted in this happening right now will without a doubt have to do with the eu its system of agricultural subsidies . 
  the problem probably did not just come into existence last week , yet this moment was grasped for maximum impact . 
  hence my earlier explanation about the fact that this was n't the first time : the ` timing ' here fits in a tradition . 
  well , driving towards the south of france with some mobile home is fortunately not my taste . 
  but just imagine if you are one of those unlucky persons that did n't take a flight to your destination . 
  great news this would be . 
  because the french have a much more intense explanation of ` protesting ' , at least if you take a look at history . 
  this is by far not the first time shit like this happens , and it is directly correlated to the massive power unions still hold there . 
  if major french unions decide to go on strike , the whole of france is paralyzed . 
  you can compare it to asking for better labour terms at gunpoint , as that is what it basically amounts to . 
  just imagine being on your way to your holiday destination and being blocked by these peasants : your planned holiday could very well be ruined before it even began . 
  i hope the farmers that are as we speak damaging the roads and committing arson will be apprehended and dealt with accordingly . 
  this is no peaceful protest , but rather an act of aggression . 
  an interesting change of events - and completely understandable of course . 
  could you tell me what is going to happen with the removed statues ? 
  i imagine they will not be destroyed - and might even be put on display in musea - but i can not seem to find out . 
   unless you ban certain opinions or policies from the start you will certainly find people who have a `` track record '' in their field that want to implement all sorts of wildly different policies . 
  and then you still have the people pick the one who is best able to advertise his policies , not necessarily the one whose policy truly is the best ( if we can even make such judgement calls ) . 
  the people will still choose its leaders out of principle , although the list of suitable leaders would grow substantially shorter . 
  there is a real problem to be acknowledged in what you described . 
  take varoufakis for example : a splendid academician , yet the way he tried to make his vision reality turned out to be highly damaging for greece in the end . 
  now that might not be the most fair of comparisons given greece it 's current predicament , but in essence moral corruption would still be very possible . 
  the thing is , the incidence of it would probably drop substantially as well . 
  the system i envision is not perfect , but a step towards a better system then we have as of 2015 . 
  i have a question for you : let us assume that point 1 through 3 will be realized . 
  would you prefer such a system over the current one ? 
   you might end up with judges being the de facto politicians by keeping them on a very tight leash . 
  and depending on how you regulate `` crimes related to the political office '' you wo n't find many educated people willing to take the risk . 
  of course point 3 addresses that but it does n't really explain how .
