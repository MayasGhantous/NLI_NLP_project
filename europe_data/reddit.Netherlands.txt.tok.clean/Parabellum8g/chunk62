  if that overwhelming advantage at some point gets compensated by superior radar technology , this aircraft will be dead in the water . 
  there seems to be a whole lot of trust in the stealth feature and the overall success of said aircraft will depend on it . 
  in other words : a trade off will have to be made , and such disadvantages will be compensated by other factors , correct ? . 
  however ; an aircraft that moves sluggishly is not only at danger during dogfights : i can remember an article some time back about one of the original f16 designers claiming the f35 is ` too fat ' and can not properly dodge a2a or g2a missiles . 
  surely , the f35 needs to bring in a lot of additional properties to outweigh all of this ? 
  in by far the most cases it wo n't . 
  nowadays such battles are won at large distances , yet you would expect an airplane of this quality to perform splendidly in * all * situations . 
  any weakness gives rise to possible exploits , which makes this disappointing . 
  a program worth 1 trillion dollars could n't get this right , and that is worrying for good reason . 
  several european countries are planning to purchase or are already purchasing the f35 ( formerly called the jsf ) to update their fleet of aging military fighter aircraft . 
  apparantly italy , the netherlands , the uk , denmark , norway and turkey are all part of the program so it seems . 
  according to this article the brand new f35 loses in a straight up dogfight to a f16 designed in the ' 70 's . 
  this means that if another pilot would succeed in getting the jump on a f35 , it will pretty quickly turn into a burning wreck ( provided he is n't flying an f35 himself , lol ) . 
  now of course that is not how aerial engagements are all won nowadays , but it still is rather worrying , especially in connection to the [ huge expenditure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joint_strike_fighter_program#cost_overruns ) of the program , which exceeds 1 trillion to date . 
  as long as there is no further transfer of sovereignty and this fact is abundantly clear , there indeed might be no objection to such a course of action . 
  the government its actions in that case can roughly be categorized as an innocent treaty ` update ' instead of something more intruding . 
  why ask the people for their opinion in that case , especially after communicating that there basically will be no change for ireland itself ? 
  i mean , referendums have a limited place in society - but in this situation it really seems unnessary to call another plebescite . 
  i will add that the government will be obliged to properly and publicly explain its reasoning beforehand . 
  reading back it that sounds reasonable in some way or another if you were to only read the second sentence , yet i gave a valid reason why afterwards : ` we 've seen enough drama here so far ' . 
  that is what i am concerned about , not dclauzel his political leanings . 
  dclauzel his comment here has the potential to split the community as he basically labels everybody that criticizes him as a potential extremist , which is kind of a stretch . 
  i believe there is more at play here regarding the criticism on him personally . 
  although i will add that the credibility of any mod that is being identified as either leftist/rightist will be compromised forever . 
  if i were a mod i would never make such a statement as above : it is really foolish . 
  strange way to position both options . 
  as if it were to ` prime ' people to vote ` no ' subconsciously . 
  best would be to put the options below , next to each other but i expect the ballots are already being printed . 
  could you link those ? 
  it 'll give everyone a better view on what the outcome of the referendum might be . 
  ehm , i do n't really get this attack . 
  i did n't deny the existence of pride among other european politicians ; i even sort of confirmed it as a universal trait among male politicians . 
  few guys have no pride , and those that have none are likely to be in a bad position in life . 
  then again , most guys in positions of power actually have a pride - a pride that should not be stepped on . 
  i do not like the position tsipras has taken here - i wholeheartedly disagree with it to be exact - but pride will always be present in the background . 
  even politicians are emotional beings , albeit less emotional then the average citizen . 
  weird priorities . 
  but even this does n't surprise me anymore : erdogan his administration has often shown to be on the wrong side of any issue . 
  thanks for explaining . 
  this situation would be different , as irish sovereignty does not get restricted any further . 
  to be precise , i would say it actually gets expanded or remain unchanged : - expanded if treaty change would result in a general ` exit ' mechanism for eurozone members . 
  this increases ireland its rights within the emu ; - unchanged if greece is a given a leave in a separate treaty . 
  this does not impact ireland its current relation with the eu . 
  legally , there seems no need to hold a referendum at first glance . 
  all those referendums in the past had to do with changing treaties that granted the eu * additional * power . 
  in this case the reverse seems to apply ( in the case of general exit mechanism ) or there will be no change at all ( in the case of specific exit treaty for greece ) . 
  interesting times though ; we might see this tested in reality . 
  out of tradition or out of constitutional requirement ? 
  could you or someone else fill me in on this ? 
  ah right ... i shamefully did n't even take the saboteurs across the channel into consideration  . 
  it would testify of bad timing if cameron were to make some ` additional ' demands for the uk its support to possible treaty change . 
  maybe it could even be seen as downright blackmail in a diplomatic sense . 
  ** edit : ** come on people , it is only tongue-in-cheek . 
  the uk has a reputation about being a troublemaker , no matter what side you are on . 
  i agree that it would normally seem impossible to amend multilateral treaties in such a short timespan , but i think there is little opposition to such limited changes in europe at the moment . 
  it might be the road of least resistance in the case of moving into the uncharted territory of eurozone departure . 
  the political will is present i think , in particular after a greek departure can no longer be avoided . 
  letting greece leave the eu and reapply for eu membership is a road that the current legal framework allows , but it 'll take time . 
  next to that it needs the consent of greece itself as greece has to apply for it , which the current greek government does not wish to do . 
  what remains in that situation is for all eu nations to withdraw from the current treaties and simultaneously create a copy of the current eu , but without greece as a founding member state . 
  the latter scenario might be forced if greece does not depart the eu , contrary to the wishes of other eu nations out there . 
  that as well will be equally burdensome as amending the treaties on the topic of the eurozone . 
  exactly . 
  you offer a thorough explanation of the problem at hand here . 
  based on the current legal situation in the treaties you are completely right . 
  there however are some other possible ` escapes ' to be identified here : - all other eu states declare that they consider leaving the eurozone does not mean leaving the eu , effectively explaining the treaties in some other way . 
  - more likely , and probably more correct : the treaties will be amended by all eu member states , including greece , to create a new departure mechanism from the eurozone - equal to the current mechanism already in existence for leaving the eu . 
  this will have to happen at lightspeed though , compared to the normal state of affairs regarding treaty review . 
  ** edit ** : a one time ` leave ' tailor made for greece is probably less controversial than a standard departure mechanism . 
  too stupid for this subject indeed . 
  and that is not unreasonable , if you let go of any principles regarding democracy as the most holy system out of there . 
  democracy got its flaws , and next sunday will reaffirm the vision on the shorm term democracy suffers from . 
  especially regarding financial matters , it is really inadvisable to ask the people for their opinion . 
  even if the greek people were to accept the proposals laid forward by the institutions it would be the result of a longing to security and predictability , instead of a well thought through decision . 
  i would like to add that you can not blame the average greek for this . 
  the same applies if the same referendum would 've been held in the netherlands ( if we were in the same situation ) . 
  too few people that will be voting - way too few - have the credentials necessary to make such a highly complicated decision . 
  it really is bizarre to ask the people this question , and above all it smells like cowardice among the current leadership . 
  if you believe that ` using the democratic system correctly ' means that asking a question to a population that is ** completely ** unable to answer such a complicated question , we dramatically differ from opinion . 
  this referendum testifies of one thing , and that is the self destructive nature of ( modern day ) democracies . 
  there is no way that the average greek has all the knowledge , or can comprehend all the advantages and disadvantages , of leaving the eurozone . 
  let us not glorify the ` will of the people ' if the people has no idea what is best for them . 
  if the greek people dismiss the proposals laid forward by the institutions the referendum will be remembered as a massive argument against direct democracy . 
  the ` greek case ' will be used to strengthen already existing opposition to referendums . 
  also , by saying this :  do you want to be : a. 
  violently raped for a few years , fighting for your life and eventually winning and rising , or , b. raped for decades , without fighting , slowly having your nation die out completely . 
  you show a questionable interpretation of the exit scenario . 
  you believe that an exit will be restricted to short or mid term problems , while greece will be plunged into the international legal abyss of state bankruptcy . 
  it will be completely cut off from the capital markets and an argentina scenario will loom , which can hardly be seen as more positive then accepting the current proposals . 
  to be frank : the current proposal is preferable to such terrible chaos . 
  but this entire situation can again be summarized as the ultimate handicap of democracy manifesting itself again : a vision on the short term . 
  that is the truth of the matter . 
  trying to appease as many voters as possible while avoiding the necessary decisions . 
  it is leadership weakness , really . 
  i have no idea how you consider that a threat : i for one certainly do n't . 
  i simply warned a seemingly hated new moderator to refrain from such statements as it will be a cause for new drama . 
   the pvda is much for big social nets etc and standing up for the small guy while the vvd likes privataization and cutting welfare where possible . 
  if you really believe this is the case , you should 've watched the pvda its politics of the past 15 years or so a bit more closely , as they often participated in the opposite . 
  there is literally no single party active in dutch politics that betrayed its own voters more regularly . 
  why people still vote for that party is therefore really beyond me .
