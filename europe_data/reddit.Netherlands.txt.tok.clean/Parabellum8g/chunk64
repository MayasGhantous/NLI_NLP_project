  a child can indeed be ` unwanted ' , how harsh this may sound . 
  abortion can fill in the gap that remains after contraception has failed in this view . 
   behavioural responses of 23 fetuses ( 21st to 33rd week of gestation ; n = 10 in the 2nd and n = 13 in the 3rd trimester ) were frame-by-frame coded and analyzed in the three conditions . 
  out of your very own link . 
  this is highly painful , as you came up with research dealing with fetuses outside of the period used by me as an example . 
  out of my own limited european legal experience : the uk did show up an awful lot in the ecj 's case law , to be precise much more than any other nation out there . 
  the poor decisions you complain about are n't really being seen as poor in the rest of europe , as there is much less upheaval about it . 
  maybe a bit boring to come back at that again , but the uk again stands ` alone ' in this as it seems . 
  i believe we some time * ago agreed that the eu and the uk its troubled relationship can be summarized as a clash between civil and common law . 
  is n't this the main reason behind this criticism , instead of the contents of said decisions ? 
   a democracy works best when it has an aggressive media holding politicians to account and scrutinising every move by ministers i agree to this in essence , but the way it plays out in the uk is really a farce . 
  the role the tabloids played in for example played in demonizing ed milliband was below all standards , and i for one am happy that such tabloid slander can not be found in newspapers over here , save that one newspaper we have called ` de telegraaf ' ( and even then only rarely ) . 
  i probably would 've voted conservative in the uk if i were a british national , yet the way public opinion was swayed was pretty appaling . 
  i find it hard to be proud on the aggressive media apparatus you seem to praise here . 
   there is always a minority ( or often majority ) which would like to swe the law changed . 
  does that mean everyone should have a different , personalized one ? 
  the answer is no , unless the majority in question is substantial . 
  it is difficult to say when the wishes of a minority need to be taken into consideration , but if 30 % - ish of poles would like to see more relaxed abortion legislation i consider that to be surely not ` marginal ' . 
  and i doubt you would consider that marginal as well . 
  democracy is also built on taking into account the considerations of large minorities . 
   that 's not a given fact . 
  i know plenty od people with right wing views who do n't care about religion al all . 
  i am not surprised about that . 
  thing is that polish culture is also drenched in catholic ideas and both have influenced one another . 
  if the church its really clear doctrine on abortion was to disappear a sway in public opinion is very likely . 
  calling it a given fact might be pushing it a little , but i am simply basing that on the development of countries that use to be very religious before - and are n't anymore today . 
  just a note about how relative left/right is : i am considered right wing in my country , yet still support abortion for example . 
  it is my impression that after the massive growth in subscribers / r/europe has become pretty balanced left/right , contrary to what it was before . 
  you can really notice it in multiple topics , especially the ones dealing with islam and immigration . 
  well , i think going on here is utterly pointless . 
  you belittle any counterargument while not answering some of the questions but forward . 
  life indeed starts after a certain amount of time , as a fetus aborted before the scientific limit - which i have repeated over three times by now - will not be able to live on its own . 
  it does not even twitch or breathe when aborted : it simply is still - as i started out with - a bag of genetic material . 
  i have a lot of difficulty believing that you are not influenced by catholic doctrine , because just about everything you seem to be breathing here regarding this topic - especially after i unmasked you as calling people who commit abortus as ` murderers ' - seems to be completely in line with what the church thinks . 
  just to end it :  correct , as long as murder is termination of human 's life by another . 
  except there is ** no ** life . 
  come to me with ** credible ** evidence that a fetus can live before the limit given before , and i 'll get back to you . 
   reproductive organs develops during puberty . 
  in general your descriptions are vague and unclear , just subjective . 
  everything is subjective in your eyes , at least that seems to be the redline in this entire thread . 
  but then again , if you want an answer : it is part of a list of features . 
  one does not exclude the other , yet the sum of its parts support the judgement in whether a fetus can be considered a child and hence a human being . 
   your opinion about requirements that a human organism has to fullfill in order for you to be considered a `` human '' , is just your opinion and it has little to do with any science . 
  you literally , and i am not overreacting here , trample over * all * the considerations of ethicians regarding this difficult topic . 
  i suggest you have a good read of those ideas , although this will almost surely fall on deaf ears . 
  whatever it is , we are done here . 
  i should have known better after reading the hitler comparison , but i gave you chance even after that . 
  shame on me . 
  it should not be imposed without consent from poland itself , so we agree at that point . 
  i however think that when christianity fades away further and further into the future poland will come around . 
  there are simply too many reasons to allow abortion , and the arguments against it are too few . 
  in my view poland could be there by 2030 already . 
  it all succeeds or fails based on the influence of the catholic church ; i think that is really a given fact . 
  strip away the influence of catholic doctrine and people will change their opinion - at least that is likely to happen . 
  but i do have a question for you : you say that poland should not change its laws due to outside pressure of the majority ( alright , that is all very clear ) , but do you think that minorities inside poland , that do n't share the same ideas , should be subject to such anti-abortion legislation ? 
  apparantly a very substantial minority in poland would like to see free choice abortion , that 's why i am asking this . 
  i understand and i have to take the cultural context into consideration as well . 
  the ideas in poland compared to here are just so radically different that it is hard to put into words . 
  difficult to say where the future will bring poland though , let 's keep it at that . 
  in most of the western world it is , and poland is a notorious exception to this . 
  if the tyranny of the majority gives you any idea about what should be a ` right ' and what should not be so , it is pretty much a given right everywhere out there in the west . 
  if you disagree with that majority idea , then i guess any reason to impose the current catholic ideas about abortion onto people that have other beliefs in your own country is pretty wrong as well . 
  the bottom line is that there are very few exceptions and the vast majority of nations out there have some clear legislation about ` free choice ' abortion . 
  but the main point here is : look around at other nations in europe , and you know it is true . 
  too bad the echr has no further articles about it , but i understand that it is a politically impossible subject to agree to because of a few dissenting member states . 
  i agree that this discussion obviously will get dictated by emotion at one point or another . 
  for example : i notice that some people are starting to get a problem with abortion when the foetus really starts to resemble a human being , while that argument is almost completely emotional . 
  still , i understand it if there is going to be some future legislation in poland regarding ` free choice ' abortion , if only before that phase i just described has really begun . 
  abortion is hardly an euphemism , but a factual description of what is going on here . 
  also , by making that statement i sense the accusation of ` murder ' going on in the background . 
  am i correct here ? 
  a fully human being is one that is on par with other human beings by core features : a functioning and connected central nervous system , developed organs , and other things that make it objectively equal to other humans . 
  a foetus that can not even make its own heart beat , because the neural infrastructure necessary for this is absent , can therefore not be considered equal to its closest comparison - that being a newborn child . 
  a line has to be drawn somewhere , and there are multiple methods to draw it . 
  apparantly , the emotional one is [ stronger ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6235557.stm ) at the moment ( the argument considering ` resemblance ' ) , yet scientifically you could put it at 22 weeks ( or 21 for safety ) as there is no chance at life before that date . 
  edit : and yes , development is a process , yet life only starts after a certain amount of time . 
  before that there factually can not be any talk of ` life ' , as the fetus in question could not survive on its own . 
  dronebama . 
  dangerous tipo above . 
  i said 12 months , where i meant 12 weeks . 
  at 12 weeks the fetal stage has just started . 
  needless to say , abortion beyond 22 weeks or so is something i do not support and do not want to see happen . 
   each and every excuse and condition for allowing people to live are subjective and `` emotional '' . 
  could you expand on this ? 
  i do n't quite follow here . 
   the science is quite clear about it and is not dependent on these subjective ideas . 
  the same goes here , especially with respect to the science part . 
  indeed , yet you already feel my argument coming now : it is no autonomous human in the present . 
  and that is where the line is being drawn . 
  also , there are many arguments to be made about the rights of the parents to end the pregnancy out of medical ( for example down syndrome ) , financial ( not having enough money to support a child ) and other valid considerations . 
  the latter category of course has to be exhaustive and cast into law as well . 
  that child is something of both , especially with respect to the mother ( as she 's the carrier overall ) , and the government should not come up with some legal barrier to end the pregnancy before an ethical boundary has been crossed . 
  it simply is not the business of the state unless it wants to impose majority ( read : catholic ) ideas that not everyone shares . 
  well if you go for the entire dna-argument , and conclude that a genetic match equals being a human , then you are completely right . 
  i believe there is little ideological about claiming that an ungrown oetus can not be considered to be fully human without being able to live - and moreover when incomplete . 
  maybe there could be something to be said about relaxed abortion laws until 12 ~ ~ months ~ ~ weeks ( edit : typo ) or so of pregnancy when a fetus does not closely resemble a human being on the naked eye . 
  but even that is an emotional argument : the very thing that defines human success on earth , summarized as our large and effective brainmass , only comes really into play later into pregnancy . 
  the neurons that control your body and its corresponding network will not be complete until 22 weeks or so , and the brains themselves have a lot more development to do before they come even near that of a newborn child . 
  before this period ~ give or take one week ~ , no fetus has been scientifically proven to be able to survive . 
   you mean nukleus or what ?
