  voters bear much responsibility , but it is my experience that you can not ask too much of the people . 
  that is not meant in any arrogant condescending away , but it is my experience that at least half of all voters , if not 7 out of 10 , are too incompetent to properly vote - as the decision making process about who to vote for is rather complicated . 
  but since we want to have everyone in with universal suffrage it is best to build some mechanisms to prevent a trend like this . 
  i 'll take this into account then . 
  maybe i put it a bit too sharply , but i simply see the ever present dominance of a few entities in the federal government as a long term threat to democracy . 
  as i said below , what i fear is the rise of oligarchy as time passes , effectively circumventing democratic instutions . 
  multiple democracies died a slow death in that manner . 
   you 're mistaking federal governments with `` ruling germany '' . 
  germany has 16 states with large sovereign competences . 
  police , education , parts of welfare , cultural policies , infrastructure , housing - there are just some examples of areas that are state-competence . 
  i think this is fair , but it is not that hard to assume party lines ascend well beyond state borders . 
  [ this ] ( https://welections.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/germany-2013.png ) chart is a bit worrying from that point of view . 
  you are better informed about the internal governance of germany , so i do have a question : how dramatically do cdu/csu policies differ across states ? 
  i do imagine that there is a general party line to be found here ? 
  what has been said by noholds . 
  when votes get funneled through the same few entities and thus result in oligarchy like characteristics , a particracy is in effect . 
  germany is one , as are most democracies in the western world . 
  i did do an amateur study on german politics , so i am well aware that cdu/csu has obviously not been in the only party partaking in government since 1949 . 
  yet even then , power still has been wielded by the same few parties , which can more or less be counted on one hand . 
  obviously because the same parties with the same ideological traditions and habits stay in power , in reality blocking real change at times . 
  more importantly , they gather all power in one hand and monopolize it . 
  it is fine if you consider this observation impractical . 
  i am essentially * warning * for the birth of ** oligarchy ** , that is all . 
  edit : about that theory ; it is reality here nowadays . 
  almost all the classic parties have been decimated throughout the years and i believe there might be only one party that can get 21-22 % of the votes at the moment . 
  democratically it is very desirable , as it breaks the power of the people with vested interests . 
  in terms of stability it is less desirable , but then again that is never the concern of voters . 
  voters should vote with their heart and for what they believe in ; only then can the will of the people be truly revealed . 
  how many new ones participated in the government and thus had real power ? 
  the number is rather limited . 
  sure : i already told you that germany its system is way better than fptp . 
  my criticism is aimed at the rule of the same few entities in germany - and the sheer impossibility of new parties to make it to government in practice . 
  that in itself is also anti-democratic , as it limits power to a select few entities . 
  hence particracy . 
  because you are effectively being ruled by the same parties as the result of the status quo : it is a hard arena for new parties , resulting in people voting for the same few limited options . 
  surely , this can not be a good thing . 
  even though germany 's system is superior to the anti-democratic system ( sorry to put it this way , but it basically is true ) the uk knows , it still leads to questionable practices . 
  germany is in practice being ruled by a very limited amount of traditional parties and has become a particracy . 
  cdu/csu its dominance is proof to this ever ongoing consolidation of power . 
  not to say that my country is perfect , but a kind of go in between with a reasonable threshold ( not a 10 % one as in turkey ) may be the best solution . 
  whatever it is , any democratic system that leads to the rule of a select few parties and even the ascension of political dynasties ( the bush family , the clinton family , etc ) can be considered a failure for good reason . 
  indeed , but then again ideology is so often the end of reason , whether it is left wing or right wing in nature . 
  people here in the netherlands for example often feel trapped between multiple extremes - at least if you see how often they disagree with the majority of policy ideas of the party they voted on . 
  it is a problem deeply connected to party politics and the ideological stubbornness that guides political parties in general . 
  interesting stuff strl . 
  i followed the entire argument from top to bottom and consider it rather informative . 
  thanks for the taking to time to explain your israeli view ; i consider it refreshing , especially in the light of the current sentiment out there regarding immigration . 
  it does and most certainly will keep on influencing the reality around those port cities . 
  the place ` hoek van holland ' - out of which ferries leave to britain - has seen a dramatic rise in immigrants using this route as of late . 
  i expect it to rise by hundreds of percents when calais gets properly locked down , or even before . 
  human traffickers know the best shortcuts ; it 's in the nature of the game . 
  if you believe you have a point here , you are sorely mistaken . 
  it really is a misplaced comment - and a straw man type of argument which you are pulling here . 
  seems like it is going to get a whole lot more busy between calais and rotterdam . 
  the entire north sea coast will be even more flooded with larger numbers of people trying to make the jump to britain . 
  incompetent politicians seems something both nations have in common when comparing both situations . 
  let us realize that for a second , and leave it at that . 
  that is exactly the attitude that made people downvote my completely correct comment to be honest . 
  philae is a great scientific achievement and * first and foremost * one of mankind , in the same way the lunar landings were . 
  yet people have great difficulty understanding that here , and want to see it as something with exclusively european meaning . 
  sometimes i want to vomit after noticing the amount of misplaced euro-nationalism that is so common here nowadays . 
  if this is the future of europe , i will be no part of it . 
  we should be proud of philae 's achievements and the dedicated team of scientists that made it all possible , but not for a single second treat it as if it was the greatest achievement ever . 
  the exploration of space has known several landmiles , and this is one of them . 
  whether it is on the same footing of the lunar landings or otherwise is of less importance : the idea is that this is just one fantastic achievement in a string of previous accomplishments . 
  great news . 
  philae already exceeded expectations , but this might ensure philae is even more succesful than spirit and opportunity . 
  ** edit ** : sigh , for those people that do not understand it again ; i am implying that philae is already on equal footing with both spirit and opportunity , whose missions were absolutely groundbreaking as well . 
  next to that at least one of both rovers is still operating more than 10 years after landing , despite an expected working time of 3 months . 
  if philae manages to complete the final 10 % of its mission and operate for a few months then it will have superceded both spirit and opportunity in terms of achievements . 
  after all : spirit and opportunity were n't the first mars rovers , where philae is the first comet landing craft . 
  blue , very blue . 
  that was terrible to see and above all else a criminal act . 
  probably too expensive to produce ( compared to the value of the note ) , thus it was n't created . 
  would look nice though , although i wonder which small bridge could feature on it  . 
  indeed , anyone can criticise a culture . 
  you however do it from your high horse - and the methods you seem to utilize are counterproductive at best . 
  you have this highly confrontational , ' i am right ' style when adressing this subject , and this is not the first time i have seen you do this . 
  in countries like malaysia and singapore it is considered socially acceptable to cane a child as a matter of discipline . 
  do i approve of that ? 
  no , but it is a cultural difference born out of the individual considerations of the persons belonging to said culture . 
  the way you act about this subject betrays that you believe that corporal punishment of children is universally wrong * and * considered to be universally wrong . 
  above all it follows the line : what we think in sweden is right --  therefore i am right --  therefore you are wrong . 
  really , reading at all your comments here it comes down to instant discarding of the arguments of the opposite party , or sometimes even blatantly ignoring them . 
  you just will not acknowledge that countries and their peoples differ dramatically from sweden with regard to corporal punishment , without being in any way inferior to yours . 
  accept that there are other ideas about corporal punishment , even within europe ( take france for example ) . 
  do n't act high and mighty and as if you are fighting a crime against humanity . 
  you are n't frankly . 
  this is not some universal peremptory norm you are defending here . 
  i can tell you that i had a similar debate with exactly the same person about a year or so ago , and i never forgotten his name ( and that i actually remember someone his username is rather exceptional for me ) . 
  he seems to be very furious and passionate about the subject , and all his comments basically follow the line : what we think in sweden --  is right --  thus you are wrong . 
  he completely ignores the cultural differences between sweden and the rest of the world here and believes he is condemning something that is just as worse as genocide , mass rape or apartheid . 
  as if it all was some universally wrong thing under ius cogens . 
  edit : [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2iwdfa/support_for_gay_marriage_across_europe/cl6ide4 ) actually was the topic in question , though no idea why it strayed that far off subject . 
  he removed his comments afterwards . 
  it ends with him warning me to get me in front of a judge , which is of course again very ethnocentric of him . 
  it confirms that he knows very little about the rest of the world . 
  buddy , you guys need to understand that not every country out there - including their respective peoples - share the same ideas about it . 
  i know that sweden has had a long history with regard to this topic , but other people from other countries think otherwise . 
  do n't be such an ethnocentric bastard , as that seems to be the general red line throughout your replies .
