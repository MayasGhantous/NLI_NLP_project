  one of the few constructive comments here , so thanks for that . 
  i think you among others raised some valid questions about this video , which makes me indeed question the authenticity of it . 
  just wanted to say : distancing myself from these ridiculous allegations . 
  not everyone that questions both sides , including the ukrainian one , is a paid troll . 
  the accusation makes me extremely sad , and it tells something about how onesided some people here tend to be . 
  as you said , this is close or on the same level of some of the isis shit we 've seen over the past year . 
  just because this * seems * real - and since there is some fingerpointing to the azov militia - it in a way damages the ukrainian government . 
  i think that reality makes it worth posting , even though the footage is really disturbing . 
  obviously , a big mistake here would be assuming that because a few members of one splinter group affiliated with the government might have done something really criminal , both sides are ` the same ' . 
  that of course is not true , nor fair , and this post does not have the intention to even suggest that both sides are just the same . 
  however , if war crimes are being perpetrated they should be exposed no matter what side is guilty . 
  your description that this horror can be devestating to a whole nation is accurate , which is why it should be punished accordingly . 
  was it removed by any chance ? 
  since i could n't find a similar link on / r/europe prior to posting this . 
  if it is staged this was a ( very ) convincing performance , given how the person that gets nailed to that cross seems to be twitching . 
  it ca n't be excluded that it is fake and part of the larger information wars we are seeing nowadays between both sides though . 
  interesting development , yet kadyrov is no man anyone should be cheering about . 
  his administration has been guilty to numerous human rights violations in chechnya , and the guy himself is pretty much a criminal . 
  all interesting that the stands up against moscow , but this man is not better than putin in any way . 
  be wary of supporting either of them . 
  the belgians at least set a precedent about that issue with former king boudewijn . 
  expect king felipe to be declared ` ill ' or something like it if he refuses to sign . 
  not to mention overly fascist [ jackboots ] ( http://www.fairfaxunderground.com/forum/file.php?40,file=90799,filename=nypdhighwayunit.png ) . 
  there is a whole range of examples indeed . 
  there is something to be said about sperrel his opinion though . 
  the desecration of the swastika ( which has multiple cultural meanings ) , the association of the roman salute with fascism as well as the association of a pair of fasces with fascism does not imply only one meaning of said symbols . 
  also , the hammer and sickle originally ( but correct me if i have it wrong here ) belonged to communism . 
  communists were the first user of that symbol , as well as the only ones to date . 
  well , party line is pushing it a little . 
  i do agree with the way the vvd handled it : they simply got rid of the wrong people as soon as possible . 
  you however continue to complain ( probably out of your own ideology ) , while the party in question cleaned house . 
  they distanced themselves . 
  question is , what else would you like this party to do ? 
  they even got some people out for really mediocre offences , yet still they choose their own image above sacrificing one of their own . 
  i consider that rather commendable . 
  you missed my point completely , or either ignored it . 
  what did i say again ? 
   i can remember a few incidents which have been handled accordingly , all the people we are talking about were forced to leave parliament under pressure of their own party . 
  i believe 2 out of 3 or even all of them lost their membership . 
  therefore , once again : what point are you trying to make ? 
  i could judge two or three entire minority groups on the actions of a few of their members , yet i wo n't as that is fallacious reasoning . 
  the same goes for this case . 
  it does ? 
  i can remember a few incidents which have been handled accordingly , but that is about it . 
  then again , i could start about the pvda its history and use it as some kind of evidence , but in the end i would simply be fooling myself . 
  the actions of a few politicians , flawed as politics as a whole are , do not reflect on the rest of the party . 
  for ` institutionalized problems ' a whole lot more evidence is required next to what the nos whispers in your ear . 
   let me tell you the secret about german success , austrian success or netherlands success . 
  they are ** ruthless , cruel , and have no remorse ** . 
  but only toward others and foreign nations . 
  between themselves , they are honest , caring , and have integrity . 
  and :  the northern europeans use ruthless business and political tactics toward others , but their secret is that they respect themselves and promote integrity at home . 
  great stereotyping my friend . 
  us , ` the northerners ' . 
  i never really looked upon the dutch , german , austrians and fins for example as one cohesive group of people , but apparantly you have it all figured out . 
  especially the part about ruthlessness and cruelty pretty much turned me off . 
  as if you choose to gather the very worst traits of humanity , only to afterwards attribute them to ` us ' . 
  you are free to object to the role germany , the netherlands and some other countries play in the eu although that does not you give carte blanche to just make things up at your own convenience . 
  or probably more accurate : to serve your own political leanings . 
  literally no idea why this garbage gets upvoted into heaven . 
  realpolitik , so this is rather unsurprising . 
  there is no point in severely damaging diplomatic relations with a nation that the us and nato desperately needs at this stage . 
  pure hypocrisy of course , given how the larger scale holocaust is being handled by just about every western government in the world , but necessary for now . 
  i do n't like it , but this ** is ** diplomacy . 
  pointing your finger is mostly counterproductive . 
   will be you mean * can * be , unless you are clairvoyant with regard to a implementation of the ` australian model ' . 
  stopping the flow of migrants can best be achieved by using a multidimensional model , where one of the most important measures would be making a deal with north african states . 
  there is little point in making it impossible to succesfully apply for asylum via the illegal crossing into europe if people wo n't stop doing it anyways . 
  at some point , it is likely that military power may be necessary as the lesser evil to stop more suffering . 
  that being : military power to stabilize the libyan coastal areas , as well as military power to lock down to the borders of said states . 
  locking down the borders of north african states will very much contribute to * preventing * a humanitarian catastrophe , as the flow of migrants from other parts of africa or the middle-east will be at least be partially cut off . 
  at best , almost the entire flow will stop . 
  dystopic scenes of huge migrant camps , as well as possibly connected civil strife , will be mostly prevented in that manner . 
  i wonder how long it will take before this incident gets spinned in some way or another . 
  i can already think of the example : ` crossbows do n't kill people . 
  people do . ', 
  really sad what happened here though : the guy got his entire life still ahead of him , yet has thrown all of it away already . 
  that would indeed be absolute horror , but i think the word of choice would be ` far right ' in that situation . 
  extremist should really be reserved for ideas and behavior that are mostly punishable , whether morally or legally . 
  but if you say that tony abbott is indeed ` rather ' reactionary ( and even backwards ) , well , than we do agree . 
  i simply feel that extremist has become just another negatively loaded buzzword/doomword that is being used at random a bit too often . 
  i considered this post really informative , until you jumped to calling your current government ` right-wing * extremist * ' and when you started dealing in absolutes , ironically even using the word ` absolute ' to describe the failure of current policy . 
  needless to say , no single policy almost ever fails or succeeds 100 % . 
  sorry to say , but it sounds very biased by opposite political ideas . 
  obvious disclaimer : i am not ` downplaying ' the current problems with australia 's policy , which reached the news here on a couple of occassions . 
  if you want to contribute , something else than a oneliner ( it 's even less than this ) might help . 
  just stopping by and saying ` naive ' does n't really cut it , nor will people take you serious for such lazyness . 
   unlike europe , australia tackled their problem and decided from the 7th of september 2013 onwards , people who arrived illegally by boat would not be re-settled in australia . 
  is this false then ? 
  a quick scan on australian policy will tell you it is not , but you probably know this . 
  i agree with the underlying message of this part out of personal considerations : for years already i am waiting for europe to completely close its borders , as i do not believe we have the resources to heal the entire world . 
  we should however stabilize ` trouble ' places out there in africa and the middle-east , to stop the flow of migrants . 
  above all , supporting states that are crumbling under a massive influx of immigrants outside of europe ( for example libanon ) should be our major focus . 
  our resources can be spent more effectively over there , than within the confines of europe . 
  needless to say , i completely discard the confirmation bias allegation , even though that insult seems to have been the result of an emotional reaction . 
  it is suspicious : i give you that . 
  especially if connected with the brigading going on on this subreddit , so caution is indeed warranted . 
  did we give the libyans a shot at democracy and non oppresive government , or did n't we ? 
  would ghadafi have survived the arab ` spring ' after all , or would libya even be much more torn than it is today ? 
  are we responsible for the fact that libyans - including the libyan elite - allowed a dictator to stay in power for about 40 years ?
