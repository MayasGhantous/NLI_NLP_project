  we could go on and on about it ` what if ... ' , but our moral obligations do not stretch as far as you like to portray it . 
  libya is an ambigious case , where iraq and afghanistan are more obvious . 
  in those cases we really need to clean up our mess , but that still does not oblige us to run a charity for everyone that feels like joining . 
  our resources should be focussed at stabilizing said regions to prevent the flood of migrants before it even starts . 
  the western world only got so many resources to deal with the massive influx of immigrants from developing countries , which makes this response all the more rational . 
  does that make it fair ? 
  no , but that is how the world works : differences in life expectancy , income and overal odds of advancing up the social ladder differ wildly across the globe . 
  it is not up to europe or the us or some other western entity to fix this issue in the way you seem to be proposing . 
  asylum should be completely restricted to those that are seeking political asylum , and even in that case the solution should be found outside the borders of our respective nations . 
  more problem solving in the place of origin and the direct region around it , instead of bringing people here and giving them false promises . 
  because never underestimate how much of an impact it can have for someone to stay in the same place in the hope of being allowed to call it ` home ' some today , only to see that dream brutally destroyed somewhere down the line . 
  despite that so many people are apparantly feeling troubled about this ` throwaway account ' , i simply judge this post on its contents . 
  the guy even provided a link and refrained from in my eyes unwanted statements , which should be enough . 
  not to mention that everyone should post with his/her true account , but then again the ` true ' account will be a pseudonym as well 95 % of the time . 
  people should attack this posts on its contents for now , not the poster itself . 
  ** edit : ** downvoted for explaing something completely obvious . 
  to all the idiots that could n't read : i - am - not - defending any extreme viewpoints the poster * might * have . 
  contrary to many of you , i do not consider it 100 % sure the guy posting here is some kind of extremist . 
  procedures take a few ** years ** . 
  also , as i said , extended periods of time here refers to getting citizenship . 
  as long as an asylum seeker has not received citizenship , he or she will as a rule be contained in a certain area with other asylum seekers . 
  the persons we are talking about should not be wandering around in such a situation . 
  as a matter of fact : over here the lengthy procedures have been point of criticism since as long as i know , although the same can probably be said about many other european countries . 
  i am very much in favor of such a measure , although i wonder whether the paradise like ideas about europe will just vanish overnight because of it . 
  because truth is , rather few illegal immigrants manage to stay in europe for an extended period of time ( i.e. 
  getting citizenship ) , yet still tens of thousands swarm to this continent . 
  but yes , something needs to change . 
  fortress europe needs to get completely locked down . 
  edit : a source was requested , so here you [ go ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) . 
   in 2014 , close to half ( 45 % ) [ 2 ] of eu first instance asylum decisions resulted in positive outcomes , that is grants of refugee or subsidiary protection status , or an authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons . 
  this share was considerably lower ( 18 % , based on 2013 data ) ** for final decisions ** ( based on appeal or review ) . 
  for first instance decisions , some 55 % of all positive decisions in the eu in 2014 resulted in grants of refugee status , while for final decisions the share was somewhat higher , at 60 % in 2013 . 
  i did n't even know the difference . 
  thanks for informing me about this mistake  . 
   in effect , that 's mostly what `` right wing '' means these days . 
  as a person that is closer to the ` right wing ' than the ` left wing ' i have always wondered where this nonsense comes from . 
  not only do you stigmatize close to half of the population in any given country as potential racists and bigots , but you also fail to distinguish between the extreme right ( which is a niche ) and normal people that are ` right wing ' . 
  i do not call every socialist a potential communist and mass murderer , nor is every socialist hopelessly naive . 
  do n't be dishonest like this because of your own political beliefs . 
  at first sight it indeed seems like a right wing variant of this sub , but if you really start reading the comments there you 'll notice a lot of racist and discriminatory bullshit . 
  true , although the moderators have a large degree of control over quality . 
  it seems like / r/europe is still stuck with the same number of moderators despite the massive growth of this subreddit , which might have effected quality in a negative way as well . 
  in a way , the nordic countries are the societal paradise on earth . 
  maybe i actually will consider it some day if society goes further down the drain here . 
  keywords : quorum , strengthened majority and education . 
  the first two will ensure that the dictatorship of the majority will actually not take place , or as a very rare exception . 
  also , mechanisms would be put in place to ensure that people can not vote away basic rights for other minorities . 
  look beyond the borders of current systems and think how an alternative might be feasible in practice . 
  truth is : it is not so hard to come up with a better system , yet convincing others for system change is something much more difficult . 
   but taking away the need to be in campaign-mode half the time might have a very healthy , calming effect , and might shoo away the career politicians and draw in the sort of people that should be running a nation ( businessmen , scientists , lawyers - rather than politicians with business , science and law degrees ) . 
  this , this , this !, 
  i wish we can see that realized some day ; a true meritocracy , without the major downsides of current democracy . 
  let us first start at the national level , before we even begin drowning people in the complexities of european policy . 
  yes , yet you can not deny that almost all of these cases have been played out in the media . 
  of all people sentenced to any random sentence , very few make the headlines though . 
  the media tends to overinflate the most terrifying of examples , which can give us some false ideas about statistics . 
  for example : crime is rampant and at an all time high ( because of the overreporting of crimes ) . 
  been a legal scholar myself , i can tell you that guilt very often is not obvious , especially in highly complicated murder cases with little evidence . 
  and do n't even get me started about the crucial role that witnesses still play sometimes , while witness testimonies have often been shown to be unreliable . 
   what exactly do you mean by `` reversible '' ? 
  because people can be exonerated both after already having served their time in jail or after having been executed , i.e. 
  it is only that in the latter case , he does not get to spend the rest of his life in liberty . 
  which is your argument , at least that is what i gathered from you writing . 
  that is my argument indeed . 
  being exonerated posthumously is somewhat useless , as the person that was sentenced is no longer around . 
  his life having been taken away . 
  of course ` for the record ' it might make some difference to in the end say ` mr. 
  x was not guilty to this crime ' , but it wo n't bring this person back . 
  reversible here is aimed at the consequences of the sentence itself , not time spent alone . 
  it is a fact of life that time ( shall we say sadly ? ), 
  can not be turned back . 
  the consequences of the death penalty are impossible to reverse for the person involved ( as he/she is factually dead ) , while some of the consequences of a prison sentence can be turned back or alleviated . 
  for example : missed earnings ( due to monetary compensation ) , being able to spend time in freedom again , etc. 
  not to say that you do n't have a point : you have a damn good point to be precise , and the argument of reversibility might be considered ` weak ' from a purely legal point of view . 
   but what about someone , who dies in jail while serving a sentence for a crime he was falsely convicted for , which i am sure has happened in cases of life imprisonemt before the advent of genetic testing ? 
  consequently jail time would have to be abolished , which no one would actually demand . 
  that is one of the risks associated without staying in the same place for a long time : it is very possible that a prisoner that is serving a long prison sentence will die in prison due to natural or other causes . 
  this fate however is * not sure * , in contrast to the death penalty where the sentence after all procedures only leads to one outcome if it is upheld : death . 
  i think this risk of prison sentences , sad as it is , should be accepted as long as the prison sentence in itself does not directly cause death . 
  we could extend this risk to each petty crime out there , but for the sake of societal stability we better not move to that type of reasoning . 
  bottom line is : one that is sentenced to death will die , one that is sentenced to a prison sentence ( or a contrario , one that is * not * sentenced to die ) may die . 
   the act in both is the same , but the moral quality is different , i.e. 
  you can kill rightfully or wrongfully . 
  if you will allow me : i consider this one the weakest argument , reason being that you seem to jump to killing in general . 
  one can kill out of self defence , and one can kill out of malice . 
  the latter , also commonly known as murder ( although legally it is more complicated , but let us just skip that part ) , can not be perpetrated without malicious intent . 
  one does not ` murder ' out of self-defense for example . 
  the real question now is whether my use of ` murder ' in the context of execution is correct , or if i should have referred to it by using the more ambiguous word ` killing ' . 
  i think that there is a lot to be said about claiming that killing a human being outside of situations of self-defence is malicious by definition , but that might be a bit too convenient for my point of view . 
  still , i do not consider that line of reasoning flawed , although rather arbitrary . 
  by the way , you made me think a lot about all of this - thank you for that . 
  sometimes it is good to read back to what you said and think things over . 
  you made some really good points here . 
  i wish we can one day see that vision fulfilled . 
  until then , the dictatorship of the wise will remain somewhat of a dream . 
   the reason that complaining about politics an politicians are not taken seriously is because those complaints are usually unfounded , or because the complainer does n't suggest a better alternative . 
  generally indeed , but far from always . 
  there seems to be a certain red line to be found in this comment , which tends to portray the average voter as irrational and the average politician to the contrary as a rational person . 
  how often has expert advice been ignored in favor of ideological , unfounded considerations ? 
  this has often been a complaint of legal scholars for example ( also out of my own experience ) .
