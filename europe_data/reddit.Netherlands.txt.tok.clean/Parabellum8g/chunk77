  / u/metaleks his confession that the matter is being handled internally is at least something - and despite the downvotes - it was rather courageous to admit that what happened here was indeed ' a fuck up ' . 
  i understand the following few things about moderating here : - the number of moderators is limited . 
  - moderators perform their work in their spare time . 
  - a few people have to preside over a community of 310.000 people , which seems to be ever growing . 
  however , this does not * in any way justify * the removal of entire topics just because a few comments in that topic were out of line . 
  the obvious solution would be removing said comments , preferably by citing a rule . 
  removing an entire topic should be the ultimate measure - only reserved for an extreme minority of cases - and ought to be always justified by giving proper reasons . 
  some time ago the rules here were updated , something that generated a lot of controversy . 
  not because of the rules per se , but the vagueness associated with it as well as the possible ideological bias . 
  given how / r/europe has grown throughout the last year it might be best to curtail any blanc delegations of moderator power by standardizing the way moderation is being done in a detailed manner . 
  there should be an ** open , public set of rules and guidelines for moderators ** , which makes it possible for the community to double check if moderator powers are n't being abused . 
  the current rules are not detailed enough for that and still have a few open ends that lend themselves for abuse . 
  moderators hold a great deal of responsibility due to the power they wield , which obliges them to stay free of political , religious or other ideological bias . 
  what happened yesterday did not help , and it will fuel the allegations that some moderators here are indeed biased . 
  anyhow it happened - and thus can not be reversed - so the moderators would do best to prevent this from happening ever again . 
  in that regard it might be time to take in a few new moderators with many years of experience on reddit . 
  and moreover : to immediatly get rid of the few biased mods that seem to use their powers like this . 
  ** edit : ** just noticed all of this is pristine material for / r/subredditdrama . 
  yes , i noticed . 
  chilling . 
  it reeks of censorship , although the new rules were pretty controversial in itself remember ? 
  there was a lot of talk about it here some time back , with the obvious complaint being that the moderators ( or at least one of them . . ) enshrined their own political beliefs into the rules . 
  the main problem with the current set of rules is the vagueness associated with it , as well as the lack of rules for moderators themselves . 
  there are no proper , detailed guidelines in implementing these rules , which i consider a disaster waiting to happen . 
  laws are almost never open ended to the extent rules are here , as that would obviously lead to some type of dictatorship . 
  but i will remember what i witnessed here - and it made me lose a lot of respect for the moderators . 
  they are n't impartial : that much has been shown again . 
  i think it would be for the best if the mods would name a few long serving redditors as moderators , preferably persons that are leaning to the right side of the political spectrum so there can be some real balance . 
  this is a community of a quarter million people , yet the way it is being run makes me think of the civil administration of a very small town . 
  it 's [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32trxv/italian_police_migrants_threw_christians/ ) . 
  gon na leave the link here , so that everyone can be a judge about what happened . 
  notice one of the top comments : this might have something to do with it . 
  some of the comments there were surely out of line , although moderating those comments away would 've been the better option . 
  simply pulling the topic in question of the front page is a bit too rigorous for my taste . 
  we do not quite differ in philosophy on this subject , although you automatically assume that ` harsh conclusions ' here equal measures that in any way would infringe on what we consider normal in our respective societies . 
  i have no desire to see that which european nation states stand for today be eroded . 
  that being said , there is enough * room * for manoevering . 
  what is dead certain is that it will never be certain how much room there is for any random measure if it gets killed off by some fallacious logic beforehand . 
  europe still has a serious trauma because of what passed here 70 years ago ( as well as a 100 years ago ) , which tends to suffocate discussion on a regular basis . 
  unless we step beyond that shadow and discuss everything - which includes immediatly dismissing inherently wrong measures - things will only worsen . 
  yes , i was promptly remembered of that in some random topic yesterday . 
  sad , as problem solving demands that no stone will be left unturned , even if that leads to some possibly harsh conclusions . 
  although to get back at this topic : what a few people on a random boat in the middle of the mediterrenean pull off does not lend itself for many conclusions . 
  it is a weird and morally depraved act , but that is about it . 
  your intentions were good - i am not judging you on that - but it feels like a lot of people did n't bother to read anymore from this point onwards . 
  they just looked at the top comment , assumed that this was an ` us vs them ' topic and there the entire thing stranded . 
  it just is a pity ... by the way i did not see those responses you are talking about ( save the one on the bottom of the thread here ) . 
  did the moderators remove them ? 
  no , that comment was aimed at the brigades that haunt and plague this subreddit more with each passing day . 
  i am noticing that there is some mass down and upvoting taking place , probably out of political ideology . 
  whatever it is , the pace at which it happens ( sometimes a matter of seconds/minutes ) makes me believe that it ** must ** be organised . 
  this place has always been leaning sharply to the left , and anything that goes against it will be punished as has been shown again . 
  i simply wanted to point out some major reasons behind the * rise * in anti-semitic incidents . 
  to be frank , you pretty much derailed the whole thing off topic and got grossly rewarded for it , while the topic had literally nothing to do with antisemitism in general . 
  that is why i immediatly called it ` old news ' , albeit a bit bluntly . 
  what i am seeing is a problem that needs fixing , but a lot of people here are so utterly stuck in their way of thinking that they can not have it when someone tells them that reality is different . 
  a lot of people here want to see the following answer : ` the rise in antisemitic incidents has no main islamic cause ' or , something among the lines of ` antisemitic incidents in the netherlands increased all over the board , in all layers of society ' . 
  problem is , that ** is n't ** what happened here . 
  but pointing that out , with the best of intentions ( that being solving the problem ) is being punished harshly . 
  really pixeltje , this place has degraded to a ( far ) - leftist teen hangout where people mostly want to hear their own ideals confirmed . 
  i compared this subreddit once with an echo chamber for a good reason , and this very topic reminds me of that again . 
  my aversion against ideology , and everything that ends on - ism , has at least been confirmed once again . 
  it makes people immune for reality . 
  not really , but a welcome change at all times  . 
  i agree : we should n't . 
  any approach towards lessening the number of anti-semitic incidents should of course be aimed at everyone and all groups that commit such acts . 
  it would be rather disappointing if our government would give rise to a one-sided approach in dealing with antisemitism , e.g. 
  only focussing on minorities to bring the number of incidents down . 
  old news . 
  what is more interesting is to what extent some minorities are over-represented with regard to antisemitism . 
  obviously anti-semitism is a problem - no matter who commits an anti-semitic hate act or his background . 
  however , if there are signs of institutional hatred - which i have personally noticed on multiple occasions among muslims - then that is something that needs special attention . 
  this rise in antisemitic incidents has been discussed multiple times in the media and the direct link between what happened in gaza last year and antisemitism has been extensively documented . 
  let us not do away with ` inconvenient ' statistics , especially if the underlying causes need solving asap . 
  also : i wonder why you start to bring in the assumption that people think anti-semitism is an exclusively foreign phenomenon . 
  nor does it have much value if it means that certain groups are over-represented statistically . 
  ** edit : ** brigading again . 
  really , really sad what / r/europe has become . 
  this topic deals with the drastic rise in antisemitism . 
  this is - and i will repeat it again - directly connected to the gaza conflict of last year . 
  this in turn was connected to muslim youth becoming increasingly hostile towards jews during this conflict , as well as its aftermath . 
  this ** is ** what happened in ** my ** country : if you have proof against this official explanation of events , then by all means , surprise me by responding to this . 
  if you ca n't handle the fact that the latest spike in antisemitism was mostly fueled by interreligious hatred , because it goes against the way you think the world works , then i ca n't you help you i guess . 
  for those that can handle that fact , and are actually willing to see it solved , i 'd say it is time to acknowledge this so that everyone can move on . 
  do n't hide the causes of this out of some misplaced sympathy , but acknowledge them . 
  afterwards take away the causes behind the problem : that is how problem solving works . 
  finally something useful to do for biker gangs satudarah and the hells angels . 
  maybe we can divert their attention to berlin ? 
  no but really : just let them ride . 
  if they want to provoke everyone , just let them do as they see fit . 
  welcome them at your pubs and shops and greet them like you would greet another . 
  this is basically all you need to know with respect to the dramatic rise in antisemitic incidents :  half of all the incidents took place during ** last summer 's conflict between israel and palestinian ** factions in the gaza strip . 
  the body said that many of the victims of such attacks were those who visually conveyed their jewish faith by wearing kippahs and other symbols . 
  yes , i notice : mass downvote again by certain brigades . 
  anyways , i could n't care less about internet points , but it is funny to see how they try to suppress my comment down the list . 
  although one could expect such a response after attacking the extreme left in / r/europe . 
  i like to burn down everything that is extreme , and i wo n't make an exception for the left side of the spectrum in that regard . 
   you , on the other hand , seem to be the ultimate stereotype of a comfortably oblivious person ( in other words , not a citizen ) . 
  a somewhat daring assumption , but you may have that opinion of course . 
  i would say that is * rather far * from the truth though .
