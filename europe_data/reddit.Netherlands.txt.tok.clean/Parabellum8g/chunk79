  equal legal rights are a step in the right direction , the same goes for acceptance in society as a whole . 
  a bunch of semi-naked guys on boats ( which are n't really a rare phenomenon during said event ) - often in the most extravagant outfits - do not help in that regard . 
  that is out of the normal for the average citizen , which in turn sabotages further tolerance as people tend to engage in group think . 
  do n't derail it into a us vs muslims argument . 
  we are all aware of what you say , so no need to fan those flames again . 
  it is beyond this subject . 
  tolerance requires ideological motivations , where indifference requires nothing else than a higher threshold for ` different ' behavior than usual . 
  the ` dutchman ' as i know him is rather indifferent , which goes against the tolerance myth so many of our compatriots still like to fence with . 
  it basically always follows this formula : ` it 's fine , as long as you do n't * bother me * with it ' . 
  which is in essence the most superficial type of acceptance of different people out there . 
  despite this criticism , i am not completely tolerant as well though probably has not to do with homosexuality in general . 
  i have zero issues ( absolutely zero ! ), 
  with people that are openly homosexual . 
  what does disturb me - and annoys me - are the vast minority of gay guys that fall out of their gender role and behave * extremely * femininely . 
  this apparantly upsets quite a few persons ( it is considered bigotry by some zealots ) , yet i wonder if such mandatory acceptance does logically fall within acceptance of homosexuality in general . 
  in each case i am convinced that it reflects poorly to other gay people and is moreover very damaging . 
  it must be painful for you that your very own brother refuses to really accept you , but i can understand it to some degree if it has to do with what i described above . 
  i will immediatly add that remarking on how handsome some person of the same sex is should be completely acceptable and respected . 
  the same goes for two guys that kiss in public , how obvious that might be . 
  ** edit : ** apparantly this is controversial , but if anyone disagrees he/she should just give their reasons . 
  / r/europe is no echo chamber - nor should it be - which motivates me to go beyond jumping on the ` that 's so wrong !, 
  ' - bandwagon alone and to throw in a few of my own ideas . 
  i expose my own ideas for the sake of argument , not to make myself a * target * . 
  i also noticed the amounts of ` beloftes ' during the inauguration of the king , which was above expectation . 
  although we should notice that most people do not know about the underlying difference between the oath and the promise . 
  this is more of a subtle , hidden type of confession about ones views . 
  i completely understand what you are getting at though , but i consider the difference between answering ` dat verklaar en beloof ik ! ', 
  and open and explicitly saying that one is not religious . 
  i am almost sure that will cost any given politician votes , especially during election time . 
  come to think of it : i am still waiting for the first american president that dares to say ` no ' to the question ` do you believe in god ? 
  it is , almost always . 
  i gave one example above . 
  almost always , though there are really few exceptions . 
  for example the oath for the military williams order . 
  not relevant to the average dutchman , but it 's one of them . 
  you , and apparantly other people as well , have misread what i meant . 
  a short example : if you as a baptised catholic go to a catholic church , it means that you are part of the catholic community . 
  it therefore is not ` weird ' in any way to say you should therefore - as you belong to a wider community - accept the rules and doctrine of said religious denomination . 
  going to church whenever it suits you , or ` shopping ' in the parts of the doctrine you like , is wrong in that perspective . 
  that has nothing to do with religious freedom * in general * : if people want to choose something else to believe in that is fine , yet in a religion ( notice the distinction between religion and ` faith ' ) you are supposed to conform to the shared ideas of the group . 
  that is my main reason for calling it hypocrisy . 
  ** real life example ** , though rather sad : a guy i knew committed suicide about 3 years back . 
  his family wanted to arrange for a catholic funeral , but the local parish priest declined because of the church its ideas towards people that commit suicide . 
  they were extremely upset about it ( which is completely understable !, 
  ) , but at the same time they were being hypocrites as well . 
  ca n't argue with that , although i wonder if the local parish priest agrees . 
  exactly , although i want to add that the people you refer to as four season religious are arguably some of the most ardent hypocrites i have ever met in my life . 
  not to derail the entire argument , but you either believe in the doctrine of the religion you belong to , or you do n't ( and therefore do not go to church at all ) . 
  there should be no middle ground as we are seeing nowadays , at least not when you belong to a certain ` flock ' . 
  funniest of all are the people that claim that the entire creation narrative is ` outdated stuff ' when they talk about their relation with the church for example . 
  edit : maybe a bit harsh , but i could n't phrase it otherwise . 
  edit2 : also , as apparantly people still do n't get it , read below . 
  the average dutchman ( warning : my own ` impression ' ) tends to avoid the entire atheism/theism debate which is maybe for the best . 
  i 'd say that atheists have equal rights here and are n't being frowned upon by society . 
  there are some vague exceptions with some really old oaths ( where you can only swear to god ) , but those examples are rare . 
  overall , the same old story again : ` it 's ok , as long as you do n't bother me with it ' . 
  politicians could easily be openly atheist here , but they of course wo n't do that out of electoral considerations . 
  not that it matters that much in our utterly secularized country , but still . 
  but there surely is no stigma or whatever about being openly atheist . 
  indeed . 
  belgium was impacted much heavier . 
  then again , a lot of them miss out on some real business/trade opportunies in the wake of bankruptcy , only to never recover to what they had . 
  obviously i am not justifying what happened here , but i can understand that someone can go completely nuts under the burden of debt . 
  exactly this . 
  the herd mentality has taken a turn for the worst over the past few months , something which i do n't expect to change anytime soon . 
  this subreddit is trapped in the deathstruggle of the former ( far ) left majority and the screams of the worldnews-ish newcomers . 
  overall , we could say this place is utterly divided , but maybe that is for the best : an echo chamber is rather boring . 
  indeed . 
  that this thread manages to reach top of the page makes me question / r/europe 's sanity . 
  not to mention that the op probably just made this topic to rake in worthless karma . 
  it makes me feel sick in a way . 
  exactly . 
  yesterday in a different topic i said ` thanks , i guess ' , since the media were making a huge fuss out of it . 
  but the more blown up this thing gets , the more out of touch with reality it becomes . 
  this topic feels like some kind of sad grab for internet points . 
  yes , as you can read in the second part . 
  although there should always be room for an exception . 
  it is the same contradiction as preaching tolerance , yet not tolerating others that are intolerant . 
  the message however remains . 
  people that deal in absolutes ca n't be taken seriously . 
  ever . 
  this of course being the only exception to that rule  . 
  well , apparantly the french stumbled on him [ by accident ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2028851-sjaak-rijke-bij-toeval-bevrijd.html ) . 
  but we helped him as well : apparantly our soldiers are serving him coffee right now . 
  fits the ` support ' role that our naive politicians have created for our armed forces . 
  i know enough on military matters to emphasize that a mission on faulty or non existent intelligence is likely to fail before it even starts . 
  and let that little fact be one of the many problems that plagues our army : the davids commission showed that much with its [ inquiry ] ( http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2010/01/12/rapport-commissie-davids.html ) into the iraq war ( which also dealt with the intelligence services ) . 
  you will have a hard time comparing the mivd for example with its french counterpart . 
  not really , and as a matter of fact , i do not think our army - or whatever is left of it nowadays - would have been able to pull it off . 
  and in the end rijke remains a dutch national , which our government failed to protect . 
  ** edit : ** i will reiterate that we should be grateful for what france did for this man . 
  in the meanwhile this achievement will be spinned into a ` collaborative effort ' or something else , to once again hide the sheer impotence of our government when it comes down to these situations . 
  therefore i wo n't out of some kind of misplaced national pride claim that we ` could 've done the same , easily ' . 
  thanks , i guess . 
  the french armed forces once again showed they are a force to be reckoned with . 
  i think stalin and mao zedong are proof to that , although the system was and is to blame for the shameful revering of said tyrants . 
  good point . 
  maybe lukashenko is starting to get preoccupied with his legacy - and wants to leave something positive behind . 
  whatever it is , there is a noticable change with the past . 
  i would be amazed if a man so utterly corrupted by power turns into a good guy , although i do n't expect it to happen .
