  which kind of puzzles me , as ukraine is a member of the un . 
  also , he seems to assign military capabilities to the un which it does not have . 
  i think the un here indeed is nato , given that nato is busy building a missile defence shield in central and eastern europe . 
  some quotes from the interviewed soldier :  it is pointless to have regrets . 
  i do n't bear any grievances because ** i know ** that i fought for * a good cause * . 
  i went with a feeling not of duty , but of justice . 
  #  but if ukraine enters the european union and the united nations , the un in principle can deploy its rockets and weaponry there [ ukraine was one of the founding member nations of the un ] . 
  then we 'll be in their crosshairs . 
  they would be closer to us , no longer separated by oceans but by land . 
  at the bottom of this lies the good old enemy picture of the west and all that is associated with it . 
  ca n't say i am surprised though , but it is sad to see a young guy talking like that . 
  he 's fighting for absolutely nothing but he does n't realize it yet . 
  you seem to have some extensive knowledge on the subject , so could you explain [ this ] ( http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/flight_control_laws ) ? 
  apparantly under ` alternate law ' it says that bank angle protection is retained while in alt1 , although the same does n't go for alt2 . 
  you seem to be right about the bank angle , even though this boeing pilot was n't exactly wrong :  bank angle protection limits the maximum bank angle of the aircraft . 
  within the normal flight envelope , if the sidestick is released when bank angle is above 33 \u00b0 , the bank angle is automatically reduced to 33 \u00b0 . 
  with full sidestick deflection , the maximum acheiveable bank angle is 67 \u00b0 . 
  if either angle of attack or high speed protection are active , full sidestick deflection will result in a maximum bank angle of 45 \u00b0 . 
  with high speed protection active , release of the sidestick will cause the aircraft to return to a wings level ( 0 \u00b0 bank ) attitude . 
  although i seem to favor airbus ' fly by wire philosophy , as the ` human ' factor seems to cause way more accidents than all other causes combined . 
  to those not already known to the underlying differences in design philosophy between boeing and airbus ( direct quote from the article ) :  in the boeing , the computer does n't normally second guess the pilots control inputs . 
  if the pilot tries to roll a 777 upside down it will roll upside down , the airbus autopilot would normally stop the bank angle automatically at 30 degrees . 
  airbus thinks that this is safer ; boeing thinks that their way is safer . 
  agreed . 
  the pax americana is drawing to an end and in one or two decades time , the world will once again know several powers of equal size and stature . 
  history has shown us that the world is most unstable in the absence of a hegemon ( as you already pointed out ) , which makes it probable that another large scale war will come . 
  as long as humans remain emotional , violence will remain a part of our societies . 
  institutionalized violence in the form of war is no exception to that . 
  thanks for explaining . 
  i guess that the black boxes have all the answers then . 
  easy man : you just made it look like you were hesitant about flying . 
  i had no intention to insult you or whatever , so chill . 
  what you said just fitted in the familiar narrative of people that are considering not to fly anymore . 
  no harm was meant . 
  and of course it is ok to feel something : i do n't exactly feel indifferent about this as well and the same surely applied to mh17 . 
  being on board of either of these planes must have been hell on earth for the passengers . 
  exactly . 
  but well , that 's the nature of news in europe and the us : negative , frightening news sells better . 
  i recognize that , as i said :  not everyone can remain rational i am fully aware of the statistics and therefore have difficulty taking fear of flying seriously , given how extremely small the odds of being involved in an accident are . 
  about the car crash argument : most people are here aware of it . 
  i believe about 500 people die in traffic on the roads here in the netherlands , although that number is still way too high . 
  but still : not taking into account rare situations of chain reaction crashes , that does not make that much of an impact on the average citizen . 
  this however does : 150 people pulled out of life in an absolute horror scenario at much higher speeds . 
  it frightens people like / u/scarabesque and quite frankly , i do n't find it that weird . 
  if you want to fly or not remains your own personal decision , although question is whether not flying out of the small chance of being caught up in an accident is a logical thing to do . 
  but then again : rationality does not rule the minds of everyone and a bit of emotion is not a bad thing by definition . 
  ** edit : ** also , reading it back you might have misunderstood something ( might be my fault though ) . 
  by saying that it involves way more persons , i am referring to every individual crash . 
  where a car crash rarely kills more than a handful of people , plane crashes kill people by the dozens . 
  it is this ` shock effect ' that i wanted to highlight . 
  is there any recording of the distress call ? 
  i take it that some aviation fans or amateur radio operators have picked it up . 
  highly probably , but you can not rule out the possibility of a bomb . 
  and i will immediatly add to this that we should n't speculate about the possible causes ( including me of course !, 
  we know , but not everyone can remain rational after hearing of such a dreadful accident . 
  airplane crashes have much more of an impact on people than your regular car accident , as it involves way more persons . 
  the death toll in general is also much higher . 
  fortunately * we * are . 
  yet there are so many different meanings to both words ( as i am not sure to which one you are referring here ) in practice . 
  there is no deliberate ` agenda ' to change either word , but yet across europe and moreover across the world people hold different definitions of both . 
  this is a fact of life which should not be denied , nor downplayed . 
  it might be best to simply drop both words and replace them with more suitable alternatives . 
   it would really help if people would stop throwing these buzzwords around . 
  that is part of the problem : ` fascism ' has become a word with many different meanings , which kind of reminds of that other loaded word called ` racism ' . 
  since there is no universal definition of fascism , discussions about whether something is fascist yes/no are likely to be unresolved and therefore rather useless . 
  using ` intolerance ' or other fitting terms solves most of these problems . 
   that is where civil discourse ends and fascism begins . 
  exactly this !, 
  when i read about this yesterday the first feeling that came to mind was plain disgust . 
  these people are so convinced that they are ` right ' that actions like these are considered ` justified ' in their own messed up worldview . 
  there is something to be said about such persons being equally dangerous as some of the most extreme rightwing groups out there . 
  both are completely convinced that their way is the * only * way , which rather fits in my perception of the political spectrum : most people think this is a line from the extreme left to the extreme right , but in reality it is a circle that is closed at the point where extreme left meets extreme right . 
  because that would be blatantly past the point : tobacco companies make tobacco products , but individuals still consume those products despite 40 years of warnings regarding the dangers of smoking . 
  if it has some significant degree of success in keeping teenagers away from smoking it might be worth it , but i am rather worried about the effects of those warnings on people that have smoked for years on end already . 
  what i have noticed is that these people simply do not seem to care about the consequences anymore and that might have something to do with having been bombarded with health warnings over and over again . 
  the more often you here often , the less inclined you are to show any interest towards it . 
  in the end , a teenager that smokes for a few years and afterwards decides that it indeed was rather stupid ( and therefore stops ) will have much less of an impact on the healthcare system than an adult that has been smoking for 30 years straight . 
  prevention is one thing , but there should be a good approach towards longtime smokers as well . 
  i really ask myself if desensitizing smokers with even more horrible warnings on cigarette packs is going to make any positive difference . 
  the lung cancer epidemic needs to be stopped , but how much of a difference will this actually make ? 
  i will add that we have the [ same plans ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/2014692-schokkende-foto-s-op-pakjes-sigaretten.html ) over here . 
  by the way , sadly i already notice some heavy downvoting for asking the simple question whether this is worth it . 
  i consider it a valid question though . 
  it looks like a minefield . 
  is it ? 
  ** edit ** : why did i get downvoted for this ? 
  it is a genuine question for christs sake . 
  sometimes i really wonder where this subreddit is headed if simple questions are apparantly deemed a negative thing . 
  as a matter of fact , you cleared it up completely . 
  i am intrigued and have to acknowledge that you have a point . 
  the fun part about the stereotype is that it does not apply to me ( at least i hope it does not ! ), 
  when talking to foreigners , which reaffirms my own tendency to stay from away descriptions like ` the greeks ' , ` the british ' , ` the dutch ' , etc. 
  i do think there is a case to be made about saying that ` bluntness ' as a trait will be more prevalent among people here than in any other given population out there in europe , although it should not become a self fulfilling prophecy . 
  it is fitting of a low-context culture to interact in such ways , yet we should not turn it into a vice  . 
  i have been thinking about this comment for quite some time now , but i really need to ask : do you believe that the habit i described is being used as an excuse whenever any of my compatriots feel like it ? 
  i would like to know what you exactly meant by this , as i ca n't seem to figure out  . 
  my thoughts exactly : this will attract the most ardent pro-eu and anti-eu fanatics , with the eu parliament being caught in the crossfire by association . 
  the mods better play it really careful , or this will get out of hand within a few weeks already . 
  about the disrespectful part : might be the typical dutch bluntness , something which we tend to forget when talking to foreigners . 
  the need to always get to the point quickly here can be experienced as disrespectful .
