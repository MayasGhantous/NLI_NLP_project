  ** edit ** : one thing though , and i really want to know : have you ever - at any point in the past - spent time on geenstijl or something close to it ? 
  for me that does not matter at all , but i really want to know . 
  you have a certain style of commenting that strongly reminds me of ` de reaguurder ' , which makes me really curious . 
  such saltyness : i really wonder whether you are always like this , or only when in close proximity to a keyboard . 
  whatever it might be , it annoys me yet worries me at the same time . 
  i understand that a place like this can give people feelings of power and satisfaction - and the idea of being heard - yet replies like yours remind me of the worst the internet has to offer . 
  before you talked about your hatred about geenstijl and other right wing media , but your style of commenting reminds of one certain type of guy out there . 
  you know which one ? 
  the way you bite off your sentences , the way in which you constantly and always strive to have the overwhelming last word ; it really reminds me of nothing else . 
  if i did n't know better i would argue that you spent vast amounts of time on geenstijl.nl in the past , although your political allegiance suggests otherwise . 
  talking about allegiance : what ** did ** you actually vote ? 
  you did not answer that question and i keep asking myself why . 
  of course russia will not cooperate . 
  any blame towards russia will be downplayed as a type of ` western aggression ' . 
  what i am really thinking about is whether we will maintain our diplomatic ties with russia after we found out that russian soldiers or russian backed separatists were guilty of this slaughter . 
  at first sight you would say : of course we break all diplomatic relations , but that is not really how diplomacy works . 
  also , there is a lot of value belonging to dutch companies stored in russia which will be an obstacle . 
  but you could say it was * their risk * to invest in that place . 
  reading it all back , i kind of agree with you . 
  excuse my compatriot for his highly aggressive , lecturing string of responses that are based on stereotypes , personal convictions and other things some media have fed him . 
  he 's either not feeling well , or someone that really enjoys confronting the rest of the world in the most unconstructive manner i have ever witnessed . 
  especially the zen part  . 
  i know that feeling of painstakingly rolling your own cigarettes hehe . 
  makes you wonder why people still buy cigarettes in the shop . 
  you are in fact stealing from yourself doing that  . 
  that friend of mine also had something similar like that ( i take it you need to make a sliding motion to fill up the filter ? 
  ) , and it indeed was noticeably different . 
  the taste was the same , but the cigarettes simply burned away at a rapid pace . 
  * snap * . 
  although it immediatly sounds that much more seriously if you pronounce it in german . 
  i guess that word would be twice as long in german . 
  i for one am glad that the bullshit story about an ukrainian fighter plane as the perpetrator has now been proven implausible by default . 
  not that anyone believed it , but still . 
  very interesting , thanks for explaining !, 
  i got a question related to the part about precision bombing : would the introduction of the galileo positioning system make a clear difference in military matters , or is this idea a bit premature ? 
  maybe interesting to know : a buddy of mine makes his own cigarettes using an electric rolling machine . 
  i explored the difference between a factory cigarette and one made by him , and the experience was * exactly * the same ( using the same tobacco ) . 
  though you almost surely am aware of this method , that is not my point . 
  what i do want to add is that it costs him about $ 1.30 per pack of 20 , all costs considered . 
  after spending $ 50 euros on that machine he was break even after ... oh well you can make a guess . 
  oh well , it was the eurofighter that caught my eye to be honest . 
  interesting though : i would expect that the weapons used on the eurofighter are non-american as well . 
  yep . 
  another unnecessary layer of governance we should abolish asap , which is the reason i threw away my voting pass for that election . 
  how many people always show up for those elections : less than 20 % ? 
  great democratic mandate right there . 
  the water boards can be incorporated into the provinces : those entities have all the tools necessary to take over their tasks . 
  tax haven * . 
  that felt weird by the way . 
  that 's a lot of freedom . 
  european freedom that is . 
   they 've always been odious , undemocratic , corporatist little brownshirts yeah , i think i have read enough . 
  my guess is : sp or groenlinks . 
  i think sp membership , given the level of fundamentalism i am noticing here . 
  what did ** you ** vote for actually ? 
  there are many things i despise about the vvd , many things i despise about the sp , many things i despise about the pvda , yet i do n't see them as the absolute evil in dutch politics . 
  for me , it 's all a choice between the least terrible thing . 
  also , i have * really * been in favor of abolition for about 7-8 years already , which was the time by which i got politically aware in the past . 
  whether it is a leftist , centrist , or rightist coalition in power is of little interest to me : the division will stay . 
  today the vvd might get the short end of the stick , but the next coalition ( that could very well have the sp amongst its partners ) might have the same issue . 
  ironically the most support for abolition of the senate can be found on the political left . 
  whether this constitutes ` corporatism ' or ` fascism ' ( as you referred to brownshirts ... * sigh * ) i leave up to you buddy . 
  take care . 
  ** edit ** : we by the way agree on something , which you probably do n't expect . 
  we share the same hate towards the telegraaf , geenstijl and powned . 
  rtl nieuws is right where it should be , especially how it distanced itself from wilders his ` minder , minder , minder ' uitspraak . 
  rtl in general however , save the news , is just poison to any intellectual mind . 
  well , apparantly you want to get your ` right ' , as you do n't get into further detail . 
  your response follows the formula : i am right , and you are not . 
  really traime , if getting your way is that important in your life , than there 's no way i can help you anymore  . 
   and funniest of all : you 're a vvd-voter , exactly as i thought . 
  a stereotype , how cute . 
  and i do not belong to any major party : the only political ideology i * used * to be interested in was liberal-democracy . 
  only one party here fits that narrative , and that is d66 . 
  i make my own choice with each passing election and i trust that you do the same , trusting that you are not a member of a certain party . 
  i do have a suspicion that you are , as you seem to be extremely firm in your convictions . 
  will you also be honest and tell me about who you voted for ? 
  i am genuinely curious now . 
  but forgive for admitting to the crime of voting for the vvd : apparantly that makes every argument against the senate directly influenced by party politics . 
  i already had a feeling that i should n't have answered that question as i already felt a framing attempt coming up  . 
  take the link to www.parlement.com : apparantly it was zijlstra ( and not rutte as i thought before ) that stated that the senate could better be abolished if it does n't get back to its roots . 
  also , below in the * same * article it says : ` de uitspraken van de vvd zijn opmerkelijk . 
  most of the links you have given refer to the same press release about zijlstra his statement ( that being the bottom four and the one above ) . 
  so far , there seems to be a faction growing in the vvd that is in favor of abolition . 
  the vvd will be desperately needed if d66 , the sp and other parties in favor of abolition want to make it possible . 
  so what do we have so far traime ? 
  one statement by zijlstra , another stray statement , and that is about it . 
  no trace about it in the party program so far as i can see , but correct me if you can actually find it there . 
  really , if you believe that the vvd is dead set on abolition right now , which zijlstra in the same interview admits it is not ( hence the part : ` ik ga er nog steeds van uit dat ... ' ) then you are really twisting the truth here . 
  once again , i repeat that you are doing this for political gain . 
  what party i vote for ? 
  depends on the situation : i actually considered voting d66 yesterday as it seems to be the most opposed to the senate . 
  then again , i disagree with d66 on more points than the vvd , so the lesser evil here was the vvd . 
  ironically enough , according to the ` stemwijzer ' the sp , vvd and d66 shared the first place in the results . 
  not that the stemwijzer in any way guided my verdict : i used it to see what the outcome would be , which rather made me laugh . 
  apparantly i am a socially-liberal semi-conservative . 
  right ... . edit : minor corrections . 
  just some quotes :  it is exactly what it looks like , and it 's not pretty . 
  the people who you see arguing for abolishment are mostly vvd-voters , the rest are ... mostly not vvd-voters . 
   every once in a while , ruling parties ( usually the vvd ) whine about their power being limited and that 's when they start floating trial balloons about abolishing the eerste kamer .
