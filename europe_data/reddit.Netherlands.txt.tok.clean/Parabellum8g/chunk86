  really , i doubt if you even know what you are talking about . 
  the vvd has traditionally been ** opposed ** to the abolition of the eerste kamer . 
  there was only a small change in this when rutte in 2013 ( i believe it was back then ) proposed that the eerste kamer should get back to its roots . 
  there was no talk about abolition . 
  there are a few parties in favor of outright abolition of the eerste kamer , and ironically those are the ones that won yesterday  . 
  check your facts before trying to frame the average vvd voter into the camp of people that are in favor of abolishment : the average vvd sympathizer/member as i perceive it is not remotely interesting in killing this institution once and for all . 
  also , tradition is categorically a non-argument . 
  it is about the reasons behind why something has become a tradition we should argue , not the tradition itself . 
  but let me emphasize that your own political ideas are yours and yours alone , yet do n't turn it a sad campaign vs a party that actually does not support what you accuse it of . 
  that is just cheap rhetoric for political gain . 
  d66 for example has long been fiercely in favor for abolition of the eerste kamer and i completely support that party in its wishes . 
  indeed too bad for the average joe , until he starts to do some ridiculous things . 
  when he starts following some kind of fascist leader out of distrust to politics in general the consequences will not be limited to the group he belongs to . 
  you and i will be bothered by it as well . 
  maybe a longshot , but there is a danger to be recognized in this behavior . 
   i see more democracy as a good thing , you see it as a bad thing interesting enough , you 're doing it again : claiming that i have a dislike for ` more ' democracy . 
  while i am actually proposing a mechanism for a type of direct democracy that this country has always been lacking , that being the corrective referendum . 
  also , you seem to have misunderstood me judging from the next part :  referenda are not fit to replace the system as it is now , the should only be used for major decisions , which barely happens . 
  i did n't deny that : i do n't want to people to rule directly most of the time as we have representatives to do that for us . 
  however , there should be a correcting mechanism in case laws that go against the will of the people are made . 
  you should look upon it as another complement to the system of checks and balances . 
  denying the right of the people to amend or even veto certain laws goes against the very essence of democracy , that is that the people ` rules ' . 
   first off it is more democratic than what you proposed , indirect elected politicians are still more democratic than unelected judges . 
  just wanted to say : i agree to this , although unelected judges are less prone to act against the wishes of the people than elected politicians as they simply interpret the law without any party political motives . 
  something that the eerste kamer - despite your efforts to make it look otherwise - does not . 
  this strengthens our democracy as laws that could go against the constitution or against the outcome of previous referendums could be made to lose their legal power . 
  connected to this i point out that the judges of the us supreme court for example , as well as the judges of the hoge raad in the netherlands , have to be confirmed by parliament . 
  this might be interesting to know . 
   i know : more than they would see realized of they stayed part of the opposition instead . 
  and how much of the things opposite to groenlinks its party program will be realized as well as part of the compromise ? 
  such a zero sum game is unwanted and possibly even damaging for the party in question . 
  the impossible compromise between the vvd and the pvda has already wreaked havoc on the pvda , something which we will probably see more in the future with other parties . 
  you apparantly got annoyed at some point as you believed i accused you of something : i actually did , as that part of my comment directly undermined your idea of me being ` less ' democratic . 
  i think this is directly connected to your will to see provinces , including the one that makes up your flair , to have some kind of direct power in the unitary state we live in . 
  my apologies if you are agitated now , although i actually enjoyed hearing your opinion on the matter  . 
  there is a case to be made for a lot you said , that much is certain . 
  cancer sure is cheap in eastern europe . 
  although i had the ` honour ' of smoking some cigarettes from eastern europe a long time back ( when i was still a smoker : / ) and in general i was n't really impressed by the quality . 
  can somebody fill me in on the quality of polish , czech , latvian etc. 
  tobacco products ? 
  because cynicism will not unlikely lead to growing distrust , which in turn can lead to hate towards the current system . 
  i am not kidding : if this keeps up in the current pace , democracy will be mostly gone by 2075 . 
  you know what the worst part will be ? 
  the average joe could very well welcome it . 
   oh , right lack of democracy . 
  i guess the fact that the elections just caused an unpopular coalition to lose it 's mandate in an institution powerful enough to block it 's laws is n't democratic . 
  before you get the wrong idea my friend : i really do not care about which party or which coalition wins the elections . 
  i have been in favor of abolition for the senate for a long time already - and these elections have only strengthened my resolve in that matter . 
   i 'd think you 'd like a lack of democracy , seems you seem to favour political stability than over actual democracy . 
  come on , do n't be ridiculous here : i am actually proposing a legal mechanism for referendums , something to which you by the way have n't replied to . 
  next to that i 'm calling for strengthening the power of the judiciary , which will make it able to check whether laws are in line with the constitution . 
  also , the senate gets chosen indirectly by the provincial states , that * in turn * have a rather limited popular mandate ( 49 % this time ) which makes it hard to unite ` eerste kamer ' with ` democracy ' in the same sentence . 
   people are n't afraid to vote for the parties they like even if they are small and unlikely to make huge differences . 
  especially parties like pvdd or the osf doing well are a sign we vote because we want our opinions to be heard , even though the party we vote for might not be all that powerful . 
  guess what , finally something we agree on !, 
  people have strayed away from the traditional parties and are willing to vote for any party that fits their views . 
  although i believe that 5 or 6 national parties will be able to fulfill the demands of 95 % of the electorate , instead of the 10 + parties that are in existence nowadays . 
  as an avid opponent to wind turbines , i wo n't comment on the much talked about possibility of groenlinks joining the coalition  . 
  i wonder how much of the party programme groenlinks voters will see realized if it were to enter a coalition of six parties . 
  ten percent ? 
  or maybe fifteen percent ? 
  indeed , out of pure self interest it is best to keep people away from the ballot box . 
  whether that is a positive development in our democracy ... that is something i leave up to you to decide  . 
   the senate and tweede kamer can shoot down laws , only the tweede kamer can create laws . 
  de tweede kamer has more power , because it is the body that can actually do stuff , the senate can only ** block ** stuff . 
  which results in which entity having the most power again ? 
  as you have to admit : the eerste kamer can block stuff . 
  but that is not all of it : in practice the senate ( the eerste kamer ) can force something called a [ novelle ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/novelle_ ( wetgeving ) . 
  this has been a point of annoyance for a rather large group of legal scholars , including myself , as it results in powers of amendment for the senate in practice . 
   political instability is not a problem , yes we have n't had much luck with governments being able to govern stable all 4 years , but it is far away from being a serious problem . 
  not to get all antagonistic , but come again ? 
  take a look at the results of elections 15 to 10 years back and what results we are having nowadays . 
  fragmentation indeed is the word of choice , as there is no unity to be found nor can a stable coalition be forced out of 2 or 3 parties ( as was the case in the past ) . 
  this leads to a kind of compromise that basically turns democracy into a parody of itself . 
  if this keeps on , we will be moving towards italian situations ( even though our italian friends seem to have moved to a more stable political landscape nowadays ) with elections once every one or two years . 
  it demands no further argument that this must be prevented at all costs . 
   yes , politicians elected locally in order to check politicians elected nationally . 
  as you stated elsewhere , you seem to be believe that the senate got a rather local mandate . 
  it might be my impression , but that is not what is ruling senate politics as of 2015 nor should the provinces have much of a say * as long * as this country remains a decentralized unitary state . 
  your statement that ` our tradition is a senate elected by the regional provinces to keep national politicians from ignoring local issues ' is rather new for me with regard to the apparant importance you bestow on regional politics . 
  i believe you do the provinces too much credit in that regard . 
  also , you pass the fact that national parties hold the vast majority of seats ( what was it again , 97 % or more ? ), 
  in the senate . 
   the coalition lost votes in groningen this election and the coalition is now without majority in the senate . 
  the ruling coalition almost always loses votes . 
  i wo n't deny that there is a probable connection between the pvda its attitude regarding groningen and the fact that it lost a massive amount of voters , but this is not the only reason . 
  the pvda has developed into a party that is far away from the average voter and a lot of people have finally turned their back to this party after it broke election promises time and again . 
  people of non-dutch descent - that have traditionally voted for the pvda - have apparantly mainly moved to d66 . 
   i do n't agree . 
  to me the institution looks healthy . 
  i could go on about this , but apparantly we almost completely disagree . 
  i consider it a good sign though , although you blatantly ignore a lot of signals to consider the lack of democracy ( that being the sheer impossibility to hold a corrective , binding referendum here ) and the improper functioning of the senate ( that has strayed away from its traditional role ) the sign of a healthy state . 
  what also compels people not to vote is that a ` blank ' vote will automatically be assigned to the largest party . 
  as long as this inadequacy in our electoral law will not be fixed , people that want to vote blank ( but are known to this feature ) will not show up to vote . 
  i think there are a lot of people here that consider it their duty to vote , but do n't want their blank vote ending up in the hands of the largest party . 
  it shows a lack of interest in democracy in general to not show up to vote . 
  the fact that the majority of people eligible to vote did not show up ( something which is n't new for these elections , but still ) remains worrying and a matter of great concern . 
  it is the job of politicians as well to keep people well informed and interested about democracy , which they apparantly have failed to do . 
  maybe the breach of trust that has been ever developing has a lot do with it . 
  51 % of the people voters not voting ( thus staying at home ) is a massive vote of no confidence towards democracy .
