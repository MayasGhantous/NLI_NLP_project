  the police can club this hippie scum down : people that wreck shit to ` make a point ' ca n't be taken seriously , ever . 
  to my dismay some have even infiltrated this subreddit and are actively defending what is happening here . 
  ** edit ** : as people seem to not get it , i emphasize that i am referring to the people that are actually causing trouble , not the people that are peacefully protesting . 
  although any peaceful protest has become meaningless because of the troublemakers . 
  ** edit2 ** : the brigading is real . 
  i just noticed it . 
  maybe , as that is the coalition 's doing , but she will be forced to take the fall for it . 
  it is her department and in the end she is responsible for every mistake under her watch . 
  dead on : a true salesman right here . 
  if this is due to a mechanical failure caused by a lack of funds minister hennis should get out right away . 
  i would not be surprised if that is the cause of what happened here , although a thorough investigation should get to the root cause . 
  way too little given the current threat in europe . 
  germany of all nations in europe should be able to find the funds to boost it 's budget by at least 30 % . 
  i read it : i did so before as well , but if you have been here for more than 5 years then i really wonder how you can come to the following statement :  you are dutch , so i understand ... ( wait what ? ), 
  ... why you get all passionate ... ( the average dutchman is rather indifferent than passionate , but fine ) ... in the face of suspicion that someone somehow insults germany . 
  i mean , you seem to be suggesting some kind of extremely brotherly relationship with germany that the average dutchman alledgedly maintains . 
  having lived here for all my life , i have still yet to meet the first person that feels just as much - or almost as much - for germany as for the netherlands . 
  you seem to suggest some kind of relationship that is not in existence as of 2015 . 
  mutual relations are friendly but that is about it . 
  legally the matter has been settled some time ago already ( according to germany its interpretation ) which kind of results in greece having no case at all . 
  anyways : if greece is deadset on destroying its relationship with germany by bringing up its past again ( the past that it is trying to forget ! ), 
  why should n't other nations do the same ? 
  as i said before , we could make another case for our stolen gold . 
  we could , just as tsipras as doing , completely destroy our relationship with germany and ignore all rules of diplomacy . 
  but then again , ** that ** is not in our nature . 
  nor do i believe that the average greek wants to insult germany in the way the greek government is doing it . 
  and yes , some ridiculous tabloids demonized the greek people in the past , albeit rarely . 
  to bring the same standards to the level of government however is a no go . 
   you are dutch , so i understand why you get all passionate in the face of suspicion that someone somehow insults germany . 
  i stopped reading there . 
  have a nice day  . 
  you literally have no idea . 
  which emotions ? 
  i myself am rational - all the time - and everything i say will always be lead by reason . 
  no , it is this vague idea that mistakes of a generation of germans that lived 70 years ago can be transferred to the current generation . 
  i will simply repeat what i said , and that is that it testifies of some really bad taste . 
  i hope the greek people do n't share these strange ideas , although polls have suggested otherwise . 
  also , you are not the only nation that has suffered under the rule of nazi-germany : many dutch people perished during the occupation and our gold reserves ( worth several billions in todays world ) were never returned . 
  do you see us still blaming the germans after 70 years ? 
  of course not , as we recognize that blame can not be shifted from one generation to the other . 
  no punishment without blame : that is a real legal principle for you here . 
  germany will hopefully never pay , as it will only satisfy the attitude of the current greek government . 
  an attitude that should not be reinforced in any way whatsoever . 
  certainly , although i can not give you an exact number of years . 
  i think that the death of the vast majority of persons belonging to the generation responsible marks the point where such a forced loan can no longer be expected to be returned . 
  somewhere else i suggested that an heir can not be held responsible for the sins of his/her parents , nor would i like to be held responsible for something i had no power over at all . 
  in my view , nationality does not go as far as bestowing a type of ancestral sin to the persons that had nothing to do with something that happened in the past . 
  i consider it an insult to present day germans that they are being presented with a bill regarding what their grandparents generation did . 
  if i were a german myself i would never - ever - accept that . 
  it is the same as assigning blame to someone that is innocent , and that is what makes this proposal even the most repulsive . 
  germany will do good to never give in to these demands . 
  the book is closed . 
  the western world does not have the means to mend all the pain and suffering on this planet . 
  also , stimulating a brain drain from other countries will only worsen the problem of mass-immigration as it ensures that the differences between developing nations and nations like ours will stay the same . 
  very interesting , thanks !, 
  now that is a valid question and immediatly one i can not answer . 
  given the fact that greece is still ruled by a government of its own i 'd expect the greek government to take the first step . 
  something which it has done with a proposal about a new income tax system , although i have n't heard of it anymore . 
  but the most important field of taxation , corporate tax , is still not being reformed . 
  the most money is to be earned there . 
  maybe all parties want to postpone tax reforms to stimulate consumption , but i can not see how things can get even worse than is . 
  now is the time to lay a solid basis for the greek state and not 5 or 10 years from now . 
  proper taxation is tantamount to the well being of any nation state . 
  the banker 's argument is not applicable , as politicians are in the end responsible . 
  also , most people that caused the financial mess at the end of the first decade of this century were n't european . 
  just curious , but how could it not be the successor of it ? 
  as you have stated , many things were taken over from the third reich , although debts were n't . 
  is n't present day germany not at least partially the successor of the forementioned state ? 
  next question : to which states does germany as the legal successor of the third reich also owe money ? 
  we could go on about this for years on end , with still no solution in sight . 
  above all it will result in unnessary annoyance among peoples instead of justice . 
  not to mention the vague idea that the heir can be held responsible to the sins of his parents . 
  where i come from , that is legally impossible for a good reason . 
  no punishment shall be issued in the absence of blame . 
  those parts are indeed relevant , as they still are a major problem in present day greece , with tax evasion being the most important thing on the list . 
  furthermore i agree with what / u/shifty2o2 said : greece agreed with the bailout agreement as a sovereign , independent state . 
  if you want to blame any one , it are your own ( former ) leaders instead of the people that extended their hand . 
  talking about former greek leaders : how many have been brought before a court as of 2015 ? 
  we are talking about the people that cooked the books for years on end and who actually laid the foundations for the mess greece is in nowadays . 
  your people suffer because your leaders fucked up tremendously , which apparantly gets rewarded with impunity . 
  that might be the most shocking part : destroying a decades old relationship for political gain . 
  what is even more shocking is that there seems to be popular support for such an unmannered proposal in greece , which really saddens me . 
  the role of the greek media in this trend is rather worrying . 
  no surprises here : scandinavia has been the mecca of metal for a long time already . 
  i love me some scandinavian power metal . 
  can we please leave the past in the past ? 
  it is really beyond me that this still can be a topic in 2015 , exactly 70 years after ww2 . 
  suggesting that the present day german taxpayer should pay for what their fathers or grandfathers generation did is nothing but moral blackmail . 
  the suggestion alone i consider repulsive . 
  edit : such controversy about something so normal . 
  i actually have a commemorative coin lying around here with the face of queen elizabeth ii stamped on it . 
  did you know about that special coin  ? 
  same , although i do have a 1 euro commerative coin next to my 2 euro coin pile . 
  i smell a familiar narrative . 
   we are unifying constantly you would say so , given how continentalism is ever ongoing in the world . 
  however , cultural differences will eventually prove to be a major problem in this trend on unification . 
  south-americans have a lot in common , europeans have a lot in common , people from islamic countries have a lot in common , but mankind as a whole ? 
  good luck if you want to forge * one single * identity out of the cultural mess we know nowadays . 
  the simple fact that it has worked in europe does not mean that you can export it to the rest of the world without massive problems . 
  there are even some philosophers that have stated that the 21st century will bring about a reaffirmation of ones individual identity and a possible return to nationalism .
