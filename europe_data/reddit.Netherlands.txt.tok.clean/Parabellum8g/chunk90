  to be honest i am not planning to do over the debate about greece 's its position in the eurozone as that has been done here countless times already . 
  i am simply stating that the greek government * likely * negatively influenced the opinion of the average heinrich by its actions in the media . 
  you talk about self-destruction , which is true from a certain perspective , yet syriza is doing exactly the same . 
  it is vital to ensure the goodwill of other european peoples otherwise politicians will be inclined to decline any further assistance out of their own interests . 
  dutch food actually is terrible : our national cuisine pretty much is restricted to ` something with mashed potatoes ' in general . 
  my jealousy towards italian and french cuisine - which actually make a decent effort to create a balanced and tasty meal - could not be greater . 
  also , i have this impression that many dutch people simply can not appreciate good food anymore because they 've digested so much bad stuff during their entire life . 
  maybe it is time that france intervenes on behalf of the unsc . 
  give us good food . 
  was n't the rafale on the bottom of the list in performance ? 
  i believed the saab gripen was even better , which idea gets kind of reinforced by the failure of dassault to sell it abroad in large numbers . 
  i mean , the f35 is apparantly not up to standards but the rafale program by any decent measure can be considered a failure . 
  congratulations to the greek government : they have just given angela merkel a democratic mandate to pull the plug . 
  some solid diplomacy we have seen over the past few weeks ( especially regarding ww2 reparations ) , with this as a predictable result . 
  without the backing of voters , chances for more favourable solutions have been diminished . 
  d66 has only shifted towards the center after the cda lost its monopoly over it . 
  d66 is mostly on the rise because of pechtold his convincing performance , not necessarily because of what it stands for . 
  but d66 comes nowhere near the number of seats the cda scored in the elections about 8 or 9 years back . 
  there seems to be a split everywhere : in the left , on the right and in the center . 
  more division and less stability sadly . 
  i agree with your sentiment regarding the pvv : it really * is * a protest vote . 
  i can remember some research that found out that pvv voters do not support somewhere close to 2/3th of the policies proposed by wilders . 
  then again , the people have lost more income over the past few years again , which might result in them actually sticking with the pvv or the sp when close to the ballot box . 
  i think that employment scenario could very well become reality , and that is why it can cause unfair treatment . 
  then again , unfair treatment is there already only you probably never notice it . 
  the employers that make a distinction between muslims and non-muslims for example keep it to themselves , as they know it is really hard to prove such a thing . 
  i think there will be consequences , but they 'll probably be minor given how this thing works in reality already . 
  personally , i believe that a prospective employer should be free to refuse someone based on the wearing of religious symbols for example if he or she believes that it does n't fit with the company . 
  quite a lot of people would wish me dead for saying that , but then again tolerance is something that is consensual . 
  it does not work one way and can not be forced upon someone else . 
  that clears it up then . 
  this ` enemy ' - picture could indeed be justified , although i 'd rather refer to the far-wingers as overt problem solvers . 
  they see a problem and want to see it solved as soon as possible . 
  i once heard a description of populism for example , that being :  * everything must change , and it must change now * . 
  in general we are talking about the people that are not by definition uninterested in reasoning ( although some seem to be unable to reflect on something or look upon it in another light ) , but that feel valuable time is being lost when the matter drags on and on . 
  and indeed , the issue they want to see solved often preoccupies them . 
  funny fact is that these people are in my experience much more often exposed to the problem in question than the voters of traditional political parties . 
  i therefore would not immediatly ignore them as their knowledge can prove to be valuable . 
  i will not deny that hate as a thriving factor applies to a certain subgroup of far-wing voters , but for most of them it seems to be a simple dislike of the issue . 
  take that issue away and most people will go on with their lives as usual . 
  hate is a type of crystallized anger that is completely opposite to love , which makes it rather unfit to describe an entire group in my opinion . 
  anyways , thanks for taking the time to explain your motivations . 
   guys , if you find hating some group of people , and you are building whole narration and policies around the hate i actually wanted to stop reading there , but nevertheless read the rest of what you posted here . 
  above all i notice the extreme certainty you seem to have about the voters of said parties as well as their motives : you immediatly think there 's one root cause - once again one factor instead of myriad of them - that being hate . 
  the rest of the argument hinges on this assumption . 
  i really wonder how you can be so sure that this is the only reason . 
  where did you get that from ? 
  just explain it to me so i can crawl into your way of thinking . 
  rather difficult to take a guy seriously that starts his response with a childish ` haha ' . 
  but i guess that reflects that average age of ` the redditor ' . 
  carry on buddy , and keep doing your best to miss the point  . 
  that at least is a thought through explanation of what is going on here . 
  especially the following argument sounds very familiar if i compare it with the domestic situation here :  `` if you ignore the wishes and needs of a majority of your population , i will vote for a party you ca n't ignore ! '', 
  the so called ` protest vote ' is a direct result of the ever crumbling trust in politics all across the board . 
  it can be directly connected to the ever growing cynicism among voters and the trend of lowering turnout during elections . 
  as long as this breach in trust between politcians and voters does not get restored , the situation will only degrade further as time passes . 
  in the netherlands we are seeing a tendency to the far-right * and * far-left . 
  overall there is a hardening going on in society , with the political center being shattered in the crossfire . 
  i will repeat what i said about this trend before : in the end , this has the potential to utterly * destroy * democracy in a few generations time and we should therefore be very aware of this danger . 
  the people that vote for the pvv , front national , ukip etc. 
  are not the only ones to blame : their trust got eroded by the same people they voted for - which makes them strike back after many years of disappointment . 
  this trend can only be turned when politicians acknowledge that they strayed too far from the people . 
  of course : the law is the law and everybody is expected to know the law , even if they actually do n't . 
  that is not what i am arguing against . 
  problem is that the legal context does not need to necessarily reflect the moral rules or ideas regarding the offense in question . 
  what you are basically doing here is having a very hartian idea about law in general . 
  there is nothing wrong with * doubting * the goals of a certain law , or its effect , especially when it does not reflect the sentiment in society . 
  we could say ` the law is the law ' and end the discussion right there , or follow the formula ` the law is the law , but maybe we should ... ' . 
  also , it is worrying that so many people have different ideas about the word racism aside from its actual legal context . 
  maybe you agree with on that , given how much effort has been put in combatting discriminatory behavior in europe over the past 60-ish years . 
  no surprise here as well tbh . 
  all these people thinking they know the answer by ironically framing a random party they dislike in the same black and white manner they accuse it of . 
  this lack of effort to explain the rise of ukip , front national , the pvv , dansk volkeparti and their counterparts is maybe the most disturbing characteristic of this naivety packaged as wisdom . 
  instead of accusing this party of patriotism/xenophobia and leave it at that , there should be a real push to understand the reasons behind the behavior of voters and to know why they turn their backs to the parties that have been responsible for government policy over the past 30 or 40 years . 
  understand why this is happening all across europe and accept that it is a multitude of factors , not just ` patriotism ' or ` xenophobia ' . 
  the problem is that the crime of ` racism ' is almost always perpetrated in a multicultural context . 
  this means that both parties might hold different definitions of the offense * next * to the wild variety of interpretations held in the general populace . 
  you should for fun compare the german definition of racism with the british one , and then compare it with the dutch definition . 
  there are some remarkable differences to be observed . 
  an argument can be made for this proposal , for a few reasons : - there seems to be no universally * accepted * definition of racism among regular people , which makes it a hard and unworkable piece of terminology in practice . 
  - in the 21st century , thinking in something as backwards as ` races ' should not be reinforced by legislation . 
  the law on this topic is therefore questionable and possibly self defeating . 
  - people should be able to make their own decisions , which includes the decriminalisation of immoral practices like discrimination . 
  this is undoubtedly the weakest argument , but maybe it is time to stop looking over the shoulder of the average joe . 
  anyways , what do you think ? 
   one diplomat expressed surprise that `` two centuries later a proposal for some loose change with an image of a hill on it can cause such a fuss in paris , '' our correspondent adds . 
  i do n't even need to find the right words : this diplomat has described the truth of the matter with amazing accuracy . 
  this response has reminded me of a french stereotype , which i will promptly suppress once again . 
  but really , how can something that happened two centuries ago lead to turmoil in 2015 ? 
  ** edit : ** the french downvoting brigade has arrived , as usual when there is the slightest bit of criticism on france . 
  it really amazes me how badly some french people can deal with criticism , but it is nothing i have n't seen before here . 
  there was * nothing * unfair or unjust about this statement , and i still wonder why such an important event in french history is seen in a negative light as much as two centuries later . 
  i simply called for some damn rational insight . 
  so once again : it perfectly reminds of a ** french stereotype ** . 
  a reactionary ? 
  i would say that i feel flattered by the insult , if it were n't so far away from the truth . 
  i notice the same mistake many people seem to make regarding our fellow muslim citizens and it tends to follow this formula : they did n't do it , but we did . 
  you know dear scheals , that kind of attitude has ruled the social-economic policy of my country for the past 40 years and the results have been disastrous . 
  it gives muslims a victim complex while not allowing them to stand on their own two feet . 
  only a dreamer believes that a perfect society can someway be ` made ' by not stimulating people to take their own responsibility , but then again the tag ` anti-military ' says it all .
