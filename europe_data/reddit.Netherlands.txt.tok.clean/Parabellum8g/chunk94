  the us had nothing to do with that , but it probably did have a hand in the 2014 ukrainian revolution and the same goes for the eu . 
  in the end however , it is up to ukraine itself if it wants to pull itself out of the russians sphere of influence . 
  no one is forcing kiev to take a particular course of action , except moscow . 
  for me it is a rather easy choice : pick sides with a country that ruthlessly suppresses any form of opposition , that has devolved into an effective mix of autocracy and oligarchy and which has a track record of oppression over the past 60 years , * or * side with the eu and the us , imperfect as those two entities might be . 
  in the end i will choose this part of the world that ensures the freedom of citizens , the rule of law and human values in particular . 
  i do not for a single second consider siding with what moscow is doing here , nor should you convince yourself to do so out of ideological reasons . 
  but believe what you want to . 
  everyone is free to delude himself . 
  the current political situation in russia is a self fulfilling prophecy . 
  after decades of carefully doing away with critical thinking , the russian people have pretty much been robbed of their abilities to question the government . 
  people simply believe what the state apparatus communicates , and until that goes away nothing will change . 
  the results of communism are still echoing in present day russia and without it , putin would have never been able to solidify power as he has nowadays . 
  this is more of a social problem than a political one . 
  another example that the crimes of the soviet regime are posthumously being whitewashed . 
  it was surely inclined to the left wing : i noticed how a right wing opinion of similar length to a left wing opinion in the comments - and similar effort as well as being constructive - was just being downvoted that much more often . 
  it seemed that if you had a ` right wing ' opinion you always had to write that much more to disculpate yourself , while some lefty could get away with using a rash oneliner . 
  the tendency surely was there , yet i will add that it was n't institutionalized . 
  certain topics just seemed to attract it way more often than others , but overall you were ` backwards ' in the eyes of the cool kids back then . 
  this clich\u00e9 is getting old . 
  i wonder how you people even come to such ridiculous conclusions while browsing through / r/europe immediatly urges you to consider the opposite . 
  / r/european is a / pol / clone alright , but this place is n't . 
  and yes , / r/europe was leftwing dominated a few years ago : i can still remember that . 
  i 'll add that i 'm glad those times are ** over for good ** and that the sub has become more balanced in that sense , although it 's tipping to the right a bit too much at this point . 
  no offense taken : maybe i reacted too quickly ( and a tad agitated ) there . 
  you were of course fully in your rights to ask that question , let that be clear  . 
  without a doubt , and the simple fact that you ask me this is insulting in itself - as it suggests a suspicion that i have far-right sympathies . 
  i just detest people that break the law or those that operate on the very boundaries of what is reasonable , and in that sense i make no exceptions to whatever group of people that fits this description . 
   it does n't fit with the `` poor far right oppressed by the regresive left state '' that this sub loves , honestly , that 's a narrative you created for yourself - not one that is actually alive here . 
  i already suspected something like this , but thanks for answering anyways . 
   i guess the fact that 400 people was arrested does n't fit the narrative of this sub : how so ? 
  would you mind explaining how that report is in contradiction what is said elsewhere ? 
  i 'm asking because i 'm mostly reading value judgements all over this thread , instead of people complaining that said ` protestors ' were n't arrested . 
  the fact that they were arrested does not stand in the way of still casting a verdict over what moves these people , including the way they mostly seem to think . 
  exactly : no word about that is overreacted . 
  that is really how the nos its reporting takes shape in practice - and its a damn tragedy given that entity is being funded with tax money . 
  there needs to be more oversight on the nos to ensure neutral reporting as the current editors are failing at doing just that . 
  there is so much agenda pushing going on at the nos momuntarily and i would n't be surprised at all if the people consciously responsible for it are proud on it and even see themselves as the last ` line of defense ' or something like it . 
  just know that the far right will rise * exactly * because of events as described in the article . 
  and i do n't celebrate that fact , yet the far-left seems to be getting instrumental in facilitating the rise of the extreme on the other side of the political spectrum . 
  they are the ultimate caricature of left-wing ideas gone bankrupt - and the worst part is said people do n't realise it . 
  amazing how the extreme left more and more seems to mirror the extreme right in the 1930 's . 
  they do not tolerate any counterarguments at all it seems , and are willing to use violence to prove they 're right . 
  if that does n't * approach * what is called ` fascism ' then i do n't know what comes close . 
  what is disgusting again is that the nos over here , in its eternal left-wing bias , describes said people as ` activists ' , although it does not omit the fact that they were armed and masked . 
  they should if it results in left leaning or overall non-neutral news . 
  the media should n't give any voting advice , whether that be explicitly or * implicitly * . 
  it 's up to politicians to categorize other parties , in a public debate . 
  what i said however is a request : i 'd never force the media to act like i said if i would be in the position to do so . 
  this to prevent you from getting any scary ideas about what was implied by me . 
   i 'd call it more a rise to extremists/populists than a rise to the right . 
  sharp as always . 
  maybe , we could call it the ` rise of the fringe ' , but then again whether it be on the left or right , all these movements are a direct response to changing sentiments in society . 
  the latter of course also holds an accusation , as the failure of vested parties had a lot do with this development . 
  these movements have a great deal of momentum it seems , even succeeding in tearing apart the delicate political landscape in multiple european nations . 
  there might even be a link with this trend i noticed about people being more outspoken as well as more inclined to jump to conclusions nowadays , but it 's difficult to tell . 
  it 's been going on for quite a while already though . 
  this fits in the rise of the right we 've been seeing after the start of the 2000 's and that seriously started to pick up pace towards the end of the first decade . 
  they have no idea how much they fuel parties like these , or the persons leading them , whether it be a party in austria or donald trump in the usa . 
  the media should stop with its damn activism and let people decide for themselves . 
  that does n't mean that i would 've voted fp\u00d6 if i were austrian , but i do not need the media to inform me about right or wrong in sensitive cases like these . 
  a great lump of text based on quite a few false or just irrelevant presumptions . 
  i 'll just respond to the things that matter the most to me :  so you lost faith in the democratic process then ? 
  in turkey ? 
  yes . 
  although my faith in democracy overall has been wavering for years already , but i 'm still a believer at this point . 
  a firm believer , but not to the point that democracy becomes a parody of itself . 
   if people vote him in then he has all the rights to stay in power and do as he please . 
  you might not like it . 
  but thats the will of the turkish people and it 's through their will that he should be voted out if they wish for it here is already where we differ . 
  in my opinion the inhabitants of a country , whether it is the dutch people or the turkish people , ** never , ever ** have the right to destroy themselves . 
  the people are easily influenced by whatever the papers are printing today , tomorrow , and so forth . 
  not to mention that the people tend to have short memories as well , especially concerning complex topics . 
  it is in that light that there should be a protective mechanism to protect people from their own stupidity , arrogant and pedantic as that last comment may be . 
  it is simply based on the truth that most people do not know what is good for them in the first place . 
  it 's my solid conviction that a significant minority , if not a slight majority of people , would not even abide by the rule of law if they had the chance , nor do many seem to be guided by the ethical principles needed to build a functional and impartial state apparatus that respects the rights of the individual citizen . 
   we have sovereign states so that these ethnicities and nationalities could for better or worse find their own path , make decisions for themselves and live with the concequences of those decisions without someone else thinking that they know better how others should rule their own lands . 
  were it not that we are in a military alliance with the nation in question , as well as dependant on its cooperation during the refugee crisis . 
  add to the previous that a ) turkey plays a highly dubious role in the syrian civil war and b ) that turkey is becoming increasingly autocratic under erdogan , and you have a reasonable case for regime change in the utmost case . 
  our own interests are * very much * at stake here : it 's not like nation states are the same bubbles as they are in a legal framework . 
  their interests intertwine and conflict , making turkey 's relationship with the rest of the eu and the netherlands no exception to start out with . 
  i do n't deny the turkish people their agency , but i will completely and utterly deny them the ` right ' to destroy themselves in the long run . 
  and there 's no inherently racist thing about that : the same applies to people here , in germany , in france and wherever in the first place . 
  it simply boils down to our world view on the electorate , and we can explain both our positions based on that given fact . 
  hence the `` still '' . 
  nothing is scrapped yet , nor do i expect it to be abolished before 01-01-2017 . 
  so do i , but seeing how long this guy is in power by now - and seeing how he gets his way via the ballot box time and again ( whether honestly or by means of fraud we do n't know about ) has made me lose faith in that option . 
  the guy is drunk off power : he wo n't surrender it willingly . 
  still , i hope that a bloodless coup will happen somewhere in the future . 
  the odds of erdogan and his party leaving via the democratic route is slim at best - and it will probably take a forceful takeover to fully reverse the situation back to being a modern , more open country . 
  maybe somewhere in the shadows some old kemalist generals are pulling some strings to make it happen , but still , the odds are slim . 
  turkey got a history with meddling into the internal affairs of other countries when it concerns ` their ' own citizens . 
  the turkish government views the turkish diaspora as subjects that are to be controlled even when they reside under the authority of foreign states . 
  there 's nothing new beneath the horizon in that light , but it 's a habit from the turkish government that should be resolutely combated . 
  last elections ( dutch ) turks ( residing here ) even got letters with the ` advice ' to vote for the ak party . 
  well honestly , since 2 out of 3 turks here voted for the ak party last elections ( i believe it was even over 2/3 's ) i think the demographic as a whole mostly got little to fear from erdogan . 
  although each and every ( dutch ) turk in the netherlands that would report another citizen for ` inappropriate ' language towards the current leader of turkey is nothing short of a traitor to our way of life in my eyes . 
  it is in that light that i * partly * welcome this next , sad step of erdogan and his ak party : it might help in exposing those that are not loyal to this country , or at the least result in any complaint from the side of the erdogan administration falling on deaf ears with the om . 
  the public prosecutor here ( the ` officier van justitie ' , acting on behalf of the ` om ' ) unlike most other countries is not obliged to automatically prosecute ` crimes ' like these ( yes , sadly insulting a foreign head of state is still de jure punishable , though de facto that has n't happened for about 50 years ) . 
  any ovj that gets confronted with a complaint from the turkish president will simply laugh and proceed to do nothing with it .
