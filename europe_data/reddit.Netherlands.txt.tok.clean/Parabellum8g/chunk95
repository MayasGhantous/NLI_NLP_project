  a debate will take place as a result of this new attempt by erdogan of meddling into our internal affairs . 
  they 've also requested/suggested that the turkish ambassador be summoned to further explain the situation , which is certainly not the lightest of tools in diplomatic circles . 
  to be honest , this internet thing about unlimited free speech is utopian : almost nowhere in the world , wait let me correct that , ** nowhere ** in the world there is something like absolute freedom of speech . 
  whether it be the criminalization of slander , hate speech or some other thing : there are always limitations . 
  under the current criminal code you can be prosecuted for insulting a regular person as well , yet i believe that part of the code is rarely enforced . 
  but there is something to be said about making it an offense in the first place , as i fail to see how insults as a standard instrument of argument will make society a better place . 
  that does n't mean one should n't have a bit of a thick hide to start out with , but there should be border cases where insulting someone could be prosecuted by the nanny state . 
  not to be pedantic , but if some adult person can not properly behave himself i have no issues with punishing said person for his/her immaturity . 
  the thing is : where do you draw the line ? 
  which insults are expected to be ` tolerated ' ( read : the thick hide part ) and which ones are ` more severe ' ? 
  it 's only because of this last consideration that i believe all provisions regarding insults could better be taken out of the criminal code altogether , and to let society handle stuff like this . 
  to add one last thing : at the moment a legal difference is being made between ` insulting heads of state ' and ` insulting in other cases ' . 
  this distinction is clearly outdated as well . 
  the second chamber is in favor of doing that at the moment . 
  it 'll get fixed soon , fortunately . 
  * edit * : also , what 's very important is how cases in the netherlands are brought before a judge in the first place . 
  the public prosecutor ( the ` officier van justitie ' ) is free to decide not to prosecute at all , which results in such outdated ` offenses ' being de facto abolished . 
  not de jure , but the option remains theoretical at best here - and probably non existant given that the last case was in 1964 . 
  again , i do not see how this example is relevant to the current debate . 
  i can call obama a mass murderer and the state would never take steps against me . 
  just to be straightforward : i fail to see the relevance of it for today 's debate . 
  the last conviction under the applicable provision by now passed more than 51 years ago , nor is it active policy today . 
  i wonder how many of those blasphemy laws are still enforced , but it 's a fair point i guess . 
  however , i do not see the link with kaplan - as he is allowed to have his opinion . 
  not to mention that you responded to some nationalist turkish guy that fails to see that erdogan would not allow such an opinion if it was directed at turkey in the first place ( said person would 've been jailed in that case ) , while kaplan is still allowed to have his opinion so far . 
  that he has to take the fall for it is a different thing altogether . 
  in that light your response to him was weird , not to mention that it is absolute in nature ( i.e. 
  ` europe hates freedom of speech ' ) . 
  how does this have to do with freedom of speech ? 
  explain it . 
  because he 's still allowed to have his opinion . 
  guess what : the consequences are also part of it though . 
  he wanted to act like a tough guy , and now he has to take the fall for it . 
   did n't you get the memo ? 
  freedom of speech is only important when what being said is fitting your worldview . 
  yeah , because he is not allowed to have his opinion right ? 
  hint : freedom of speech got nothing to do with it , but only a fool could come to the conclusion the opposite applies here there 's a difference between * allowing * to have opinion x , instead of approving of it . 
  he took the fall for it , as was to be expected . 
  even dictators like erdogan are allowed to spray their verbal vomit all over the place . 
  that does n't mean i 'm going to approve of that --  goatfucker < -- his ideas though . 
  this argument is being used a lot and i highly doubt whether it is as absolute of a truth as people tend to suggest . 
  moving your hq , or any other important office in country x is also a kind of capital destruction . 
  you 'll lose valuable employees with inside knowledge about your company , not to mention that such a move will always cost money in the short term . 
  although i agree that it would different in this case for those companies that are just there ` on paper ' : those will indeed move . 
  but the net is closing , the number of havens diminishing . 
  maybe this will indeed prove to be the end of the line for companies like apple that partake in this behavior . 
  because i figure that the larger , more wealthy countries will start relentlessly pressing other , smaller countries to stop facilitating it , at the threat of blocking all payment traffic . 
  if i 'm not mistaken a similar threat was issued to swiss a few years back , and now its banking secret is mostly history . 
  interesting that my country is not involved in this iniative , despite its crucial role in sluicing the value of about 1/10th the worth of the world 's economy through its own financial and legal infrastructure on a yearly basis . 
  i guess its telling again about how the netherlands needs outward pressure to change its course regarding tax evasion and moreover , that it is n't trusted to be part of this iniative despite that it would make a lot of sense . 
  but morality does n't buy you a couple of billion ( at the cost of numerous other countries in the world ) and the position of the dutch government will probably have be found in that corner . 
  foreign aid ** will ** solve that issue provided that enough oversight is taking place . 
  this means making strict agreements with developing countries , especially with regard to those with rampant corruption . 
  if need be that should mean that certain parts of the local administration should be placed under the oversight of donating nations ( with a co-vote , or even a veto right ) to make sure money gets well spent . 
  if you want to give money you should n't be afraid to make demands : that 's what is lacking in my view at this point . 
  stimulating people to leave those countries in exchange for the vague odds of being granted asylum here is a perverse incentive , and much more bankrupt than dropping suitcases full of money . 
  edit : fixed some things . 
  well what 's also different is that the uk got a ** right ** to leave , embedded in the treaties . 
  article 50 of the teu [ guarantees this ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:c:2008:115:0013:0045:en:pdf ) . 
  other member states do n't have a say about that : they already abandoned their ` right ' to object ( if it ever existed ) by agreeing to the current text of the treaty . 
  racial profiling ( fortunately ) is n't necessary : just gather evidence on what the person in question has said or done and you 'll have your case . 
  what is really important is the second thing : defining what ` treachery ' here is . 
  i think it can be done by creating a narrow legal definition of it , aimed at specific acts of hatred and/or sabotage of western society . 
  what ` the west ' is is n't difficult to define , and with that narrow definition the risk for a gliding scale can also be appropriatly decreased . 
  a local definition ( e.g. 
  ` treason against the most fundamental principles of dutch society ' , just to give an example ) would probably be even easier . 
  i agree that it should n't be open-ended though : that would be highly dangerous and self-defeating . 
  he is , as ` such rhetoric ' is being framed as an inherent excuse for genocide in the long run , which i consider to be a particularly low blow . 
  especially against the backdrop of the massive social problems with certain ethnicities in western european nations , where a huge disloyalty problem is creating problems that need to be handled properly and pro-actively in the next 20 or so years to even halt its advance . 
  it will take decades to completely root it out by now . 
  i think his attitude is typical of many europeans as of 2016 : immediatly jump to a kneejerk response - and refuse to even consider whether there is * some truth * to what was said . 
  it basically is a pc-light response ( mind you , i almost never use that accusation as it is overused ) and in the end a thousand times more detrimental than what i ever suggested . 
  honestly , i believe that attitude actively contributes in making one stupid at this point , but silly me i guess . 
  i 'll retire and waste my time on something else . 
  op got his own goals : he 's an active participant to / r/the _ donald . 
  that should say enough . 
  boring : you completely and purposely misinterpreted what i said . 
  i said :  i honestly doubt ... * per se * meaning that it could very well could be . 
  but people that are n't loyal to their own nation to the point that they even hate it and are actively not contributing to society should be fixed one way or another . 
  punitive monetary measures would be a good starting point for such people . 
  criminal law measures and deportation ( for those with dual passports ) should be on the horizon as extreme measures for rare cases . 
  an atmosphere must come into existence which is uncompromising to those that refuse to accept western society and effectively try to create parallel societies against it . 
  that does n't mean that one can not still adhere to islam for example , or partly identify as e.g. 
  but when push comes to shove that person * must * primarily identify as dutch/belgian/french etc. 
  to ensure he or she is actually part of society . 
  also , do n't think that my group of ` traitors ' above numbers in the millions . 
  it probably numbers in the thousands in the netherlands and in the tens of thousands across the eu . 
  take out the main troublemakers and results will follow . 
  those people that ca n't agree to that will leave in large numbers on their own accord . 
  nice editorialized title by the way . 
  it was an interesting read ( for those who read it , probably around 20 % at most or so ) , yet you should have posted the real title . 
  i honestly doubt that any piece of legislation aimed at punishing treachery is at odds with human rights * per se * . 
  it could be , but not necessarily . 
  we should n't act like reeducating/punishing/deporting traitors is that controversial . 
  because really , that 's what the people that hold such opinions are : traitors to their host state and the people around them . 
  i say host state , as they never accepted it as their own . 
  not really , as it can already leave the room . 
  the same logic does n't even apply , as all of them are n't obligated to stay and reach a consensus . 
  it 's the difference between ` having to agree ' and ` having the freedom to walk away ' . 
  yep .
