  all the other team members disagree with this one though . 
  imagine being in a room with about 30 people , having to overthink a difficult issue , and everyone is in total agreement about what should happen . 
  except you of course : you - in a * bit * of an arrogant fashion - claim that everything should go ** your ** way . 
  i think you know what the response is . 
   how right you may be of putin and present day russia it holds only sentimental value . 
  the referendum clearly states if you want the eu to sign a treaty with ukraine . 
  i do n't think voting for this treaty only to piss-of putin is the right way to think . 
  touch\u00e9 , although voting in favor to not help putin achieve his goals in foreign policy was just one reason for me - albeit an important one . 
  the referendum in a way presented us with a choice about who to trust more in the mess that is the ukrainian conflict . 
  in my view there is not much wrong with helping a country to better itself , especially if that also expands european influence towards the east . 
  although it is important to remind myself that any commitment to improve ukraine will take decades to come to full fruitition . 
  i do n't have the illusion that ukraine will suddenly improve overnight : it will be a long , painstakingly slow process that will test the limits of all parties involved . 
   i did n't vote against because of some moral vacuum but because of the real possibilty of armed confilict and futher economic sanctions against innocent dutch businesses . 
  i will also ask you : do you want to drag us ( netherlands ) into a military confilict with russia because you want to help ukraine/piss-of russia ? 
  no , the last thing i want is a war with russia . 
  but if our way of life at any point gets attacked by russia again , either on purpose or by accident , we should be mentally prepared to strike back . 
  and we strike back the way we know best : by making trade agreements and by helping in other ways we can - in accordance with international law . 
  moscow time and again has shown it does not care about international law and in that sense is a highly unreliable force in the region . 
  also , there is still something as ` ondernemersrisico ' : every company that wants to operate in an unstable and unpredictable market should know that the political reality could change on a daily basis , even though i also regret that dutch companies are the victim of this . 
  but what would we care about our own people , if we continue trading with those that butcher our own ? 
  that seems oddly servile in my eyes - and cowardly - and we should certainly not close russia in our arms again any time soon . 
  not before they fully open up on what happened . 
  if russia would start a large military operation to assimilate ( large parts ) of ukraine beyond the one that it is partaking in right now , war should be an option we can not discard - albeit the very last one after all other measures have failed . 
  and once again : i do n't want that , but it would be treason to our own way of life and our own people to let russia have its way in that case . 
  russia only understands tough language - something the americans have understood for years by now . 
   so why would be sacrifice more of our wealth and people so ukraine can have a better economy ? 
  to be on the right side maybe ? 
  to not indirectly achieve putin his goals as we did yesterday ? 
  ukraine may be corrupt to the bone , but vastly preferable to the mafia state that is present day russia . 
  furthermore i find the suggestion that this is in the best interest of us while in the process de facto cooperating with russia beyond disgusting : the country that killed our people refuses to take on responsibility and we are making a fool out of ourselves by helping putin to get what he wants this way . 
  and on top of the previous , maybe , maybe , because ` me me me ' sometimes is not an argument for all situations ? 
  because the arrogance of the people that voted ` against ' yesterday - that screwed over another country just to make a point - is part of the moral vacuum i 've noticed in the netherlands way too often by now . 
  many people here do n't care about anything else but themselves , as they are incapable to expand their own horizon . 
  just stop it , ok . 
  this is becoming a disgrace - and i 'd urge you to reconsider what / u/0xnld said : cool down a few days , and then come back . 
  do n't say anything rash out of sheer emotion . 
  you are not helping the attitude of the people that voted ` in favor ' including myself , nor should you forget that most people in my experience just voted anti-eu . 
  not to mention that many of the lower educated have bad experiences with the eu , as many poles , romanians , etc. 
  ` took their jobs ' - and due to the differences in what both are paid in the netherlands there is something to be said about that being true . 
  there is more at play here in the background that complicates the situation even further . 
  as a dutch person , i really wonder where you get that wisdom from . 
  because it is * far * from the truth to say the least , yet you still seem convinced you know it better than someone from here . 
  not to mention the faults in this :  except all the political parties that organized the referendum and supported the vote against the ukraine association agreement which are like 2 fringe parties , and 1 strange animal rights party . 
  they occupy about 20 % of all seats in the second chamber . 
  it 's not like vested parties here are against the treaty , as all the other major parties were ** fully in favor ** . 
  that includes all the traditional parties here , including the vvd , cda and pvda , as well as d66 , groenlinks and the smaller christian parties . 
   the eu allows you to leave . 
  now i know how the british redditors here feel . 
  this is quite insightful . 
  yes , the ` in favor ' camp clearly shot themselves in their own foot as they came over as dishonest by not giving that much publicity to the referendum only until it was getting obvious that 30 % might be reached . 
  by then it was of course already too late as the ` against ' camp had already been campaigning for many months by now . 
  but lets be rational as well : anti-eu sentiment is strong in the eu , and it was n't much different in the past when the referendum regarding the european constitution was held here . 
  it was highly unlikely that a strong campaign from both sides would 've resulted in a vote ` in favor ' anyways , so a part of me understands their position as well . 
  then again : they did n't even bother to try and convince people and therefore we 'll never know for sure . 
  the memories of people tend to be short : i 'm fully convinced that most people that refer to how corrupt the current political class in ukraine is simply forgot how insanely corrupt yanukovych and his cronies were . 
  but really , this referendum was n't aimed at ukraine - i can pretty much guarantee you that much : most people that voted against voted against the eu . 
  if the opposite would be true i 'd say it as well , but i 'm convinced that is n't the case . 
  highly probably . 
  expect some minor , unimportant changes at worst , just to give the impression that the government here actually cared about the people that came to vote . 
  after all : the netherlands is not in any position to renegotiate the treaty on its own and even trying it would be a show of great arrogance . 
  the 30 % of the treaty that was part of the referendum will just go on , so do n't worry . 
  that 's actually the strongest counterargument to what was just said . 
  i like to think that elections are a necessary evil to prevent tyranny : not something that we do because its efficient in bringing about proper policy . 
  my position is simply that we should not make a habit about asking the average joe his opinion on a whole range of subjects and that we better leave it to elected politicians , flawed and incompetent as many of them may be . 
  a good question : there was a lot of fuss about the 30 % threshold lately , with just about every legal authority that was asked his/her opinion being against it . 
  we better just place it at 50 % + 1 voter or remove it altogether : it 's difficult to see what added value 30 % got for an advisory referendum . 
  a threshold can give a judicial framework for judging the ` value ' of the outcome though : that way the discussion will already be closed beforehand . 
  the thing is that 30 % is a meaningless threshold and it will undoubtedly be part of the upcoming debate about what to do with the association treaty . 
  turnout can still change of course , but at this point there 's a real probability that the 30 % threshold will not be reached . 
  if it 's not valid , the netherlands will have saved face after all . 
  something which i do not mourn to be honest as this referendum was a bad idea to start out with : it 's a hopelessly complex topic that your average citizen ca n't hope to give a proper verdict about . 
  not to mention that the campaigning from the ` against ' camp has been above annoying over the past few months . 
  ** edit ** : new poll suggests 32 % turnout , though the 3 % margin of error remains . 
  i guess we 'll know by tomorrow . 
  ** edit 2 ** : last update . 
  after counting 51,2 % of all votes the turnout is 32,3 % . 
  at this point i expect that the threshold will have been reached , albeit barely !, 
  now lets see what insignificant part of the treaty the government will try to renegotiate . 
  of course , this time there are n't ` important ' subjects like flags or anthems ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ) , so i guess rutte will have to find something else  . 
  or option 2 applies , which is at this point more likely : the law concerning the association treaty will just be passed again , citing reasons of low turnout . 
  lets see if that 's still the case 2 or 3 months from now . 
  polls have proven to have little predictive value after major events . 
  you 're welcome i guess  . 
   so my no vote is about giving the eu the finger which is another reason why the outcome will likely be ignored by the hague . 
  the instrument of referendum is being misused here ( also by you ) - and that 's why there 's a good case to be made about ignoring the results beforehand already . 
  especially if 50 % turnout will not be reached , which is almost a given . 
  i 'm not against referendums for special situations , but this surely is n't one of them : the subject at hand is too complex , and voters on both sides are grossly misinformed . 
  i 'll vote in favor , despite that this referendum is already void beforehand . 
  firstly , the average jan ca n't hope to know what the proper vote is here : the association treaty is too complex of a subject and does n't lend itself for a plebiscite . 
  secondly , it 's also void because people today will mostly be ( at least partly ) voting against the eu . 
  ukraine is just the unfortunate victim here , sacrificed on the altar of direct democracy - for an association treaty that will not be stopped regardless . 
  even the 30 % of it that requires unanimous consent among eu member states is highly unlikely to be significantly changed as we do n't have the negotiation position for it . 
  again : this is pointless . 
   i respect it almost entirely because the government is more powerful than i am and there would be consequences for certain laws that i break . 
  that is implied when i speak of local law/the law of the land . 
  the state will always uphold its own laws as the opposite will lead to its destruction of course  . 
   trying to go through the `` proper channels '' just is n't really much of an option for the people affected by this law . 
  that is like asking a pot smoker in 2000 to just lobby for congress to change the law before smoking pot . 
  i 'm sorry , that is just to long of a process and wo n't necessarily result in any change . 
  however , breaking the law without hurting other people does help a culture change towards the law .
