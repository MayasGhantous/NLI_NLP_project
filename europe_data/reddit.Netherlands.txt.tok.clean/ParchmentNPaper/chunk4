  ( i 'm not black , but i would like to have more money ) the thing is , chicago is safe for wealthy white people , so if that 's what 's being looked at , sure . 
  however , if it is , then i will call the list completely useless . 
  it 's not like you ca n't say the same about almost every other city in the world . 
  if you 're rich and living in a nice neighbourhood , you 'll probably be pretty safe , whichever city you 're in . 
  0 % chance . 
  that is not an exaggeration . 
  even if he did somehow magically manage to become the largest party -- which he wo n't -- he still would n't be anywhere near becoming part of the government . 
  every other relevant party has excluded joining a coalition with him . 
  his voter ceiling seems to be somewhere between 15-20 % , so without that support from other parties , he ca n't ever form a government . 
  exactly , if we ignore all the unsafety , chicago is actually pretty safe . 
  correct . 
  every party , apart from a few fringe ones that wo n't give him anything even remotely close to a majority , have ruled out forming a coalition with his party , pvv . 
  pvv are also not projected to become the largest , being beaten in the polls by our prime minister 's party , vvd . 
  also , there is no other party in parliament that would support leaving eu . 
  that was why the gathering that was planned by the turkish minister was n't allowed at first , not why he was banned from speaking outright . 
  there were negotiations going on between the two governments about an alternative venue when the turkish minister publicly threatened sanctions if he would n't be allowed to speak . 
  that 's when the netherlands banned him and any other turkish cabinet member . 
  that 's the voc mentality , right there !, 
  we should never have let you guys leave . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liever_turks_dan_paaps ), 
  the [ current polls ] ( http://peilingwijzer.tomlouwerse.nl/ ) put his support around 15 % . 
  you seem to be purposefully missing every point people are trying to make . 
  i agree with / u/fatortu , you are arguing in bad faith . 
   and what 's the point of these parades anyways ? 
  i think the point is to continue to challenge the kind of thinking that allowed gays to be second-rate citizens in the first place . 
  even when they are equal to the law , the idea that anything that does not adhere to the established norm is wrong is a strong one , that springs up in plenty of places , not just when it comes to sexuality . 
  we may not be running the risk of forcing women to wear burqas here , but i would argue that laws like that come from the same type of thinking as not allowing gays to adopt ( i 'm not saying that anti-parade people are like the taliban here , i 'm saying the taliban are like normal people ) . 
  by shocking or even disgusting people , these parades serve to point out that something as harmless as running around almost naked with feathers on your head is still something that is frowned upon by many . 
  although many of the people in the parades are just in it for the silliness , i think the deeper idea behind them is that we should always examine the thoughts that come to us easily . 
  i would like to think that challenging everything is a staple of european culture , at least it has been since the french revolution . 
  `` parades are disgusting . '', 
  why would we think that ? 
  is it because of their bad taste ? 
  if so , then try to understand that taste is a social construct . 
  these people run around in outfits that might not have been so strange to past amazonian tribes and maybe even looked `` normal '' to them , which proves that as humans , we are clearly capable of * not * finding it shocking/disgusting . 
  since humans are so comfortable with things that fit in with how we see the world and we are not with things that differ from that , and since i do n't see that changing anytime soon , i believe we need these parades for as long as they manage to disgust/shock people . 
  and long after , it 's still a party . 
   do you think someone who 's on a fence in regards to gay rights will suddenly have an epiphany due to such parades ? 
  honestly ? 
  they ( and you ) do n't have to like the parades , but if they actually manage to become anti-gay-rights because of something this harmless , then i question how on the fence they ( and you ) actually were in the first place or if they were just paying lip service to it . 
  having these parades shows that society accepts gay people and accepts that gay people are allowed to express themselves in whatever way they feel like ( without limiting other people 's freedoms or advocating such , of course ) . 
  it 's society 's way of underlining the basic human rights . 
  i 've seen two or three gay prides in my life , but i 've never seen a dick there , shriveled and wrinkly or otherwise . 
  i 've seen people in about as much clothing as many people wear in the swimming pool or on the beach , but no dicks . 
  of course , that could just be because i was n't actively looking for any , maybe that 's why your experience was different ? 
  napoleon 's youngest brother still has living descendants . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles,_prince_napol\u00e9on ) and [ his son ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-christophe,_prince_napol\u00e9on ) ( bonapartists do n't like the older of the two , so they 've named his son as head of the house ) . 
  if you want to put a napoleon on a throne somewhere and reinstate the dynasty , you still can . 
  1814-1839 ( or 1830/1 if you 're one of those upstart southerners ), 
  wikipedia says the difference [ is dependent on the position . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopard_ ( heraldry \\ ) ) this would make the english lions leopards too , except in the uk , the distinction is n't made , so calling them lions is correct . 
  den haag is the older name of the two though . 
  [ bit more about it in dutch ] ( https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/den-haag-s-gravenhage ) . 
  for those who want to be certain they use the correct map of the netherlands for a certain time period , [ this website ] ( https://archeologieinnederland.nl/bronnen-en-kaarten/paleogeografische-kaarten ) has pdfs with maps of the historical geographical situation . 
  all in dutch , but google translate should help somewhat . 
   the raid on the medway that is , oddly enough , not what this poster is referencing , despite it being arguably the greatest dutch military victory in history . 
  1673 was in the 3rd anglo-dutch war , medway was in the 2nd one , in 1667 . 
  the 3rd one was part of a larger war where france was our main adversary , not england , and where we were also at war with 2 german nations ( m\u00fcnster and cologne ) . 
  does n't seem like the best choice for this , but maybe that 's why i 'm not a nazi propagandist . 
  either that or my political convictions . 
  i 'm trying to find out if they used a real ship for reference , ca n't seem to find it though . 
  the sternpiece resembles that of [ * de zeven provinci\u00ebn * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/heckspiegel_de_zeven_provincien1.jpg ) , michiel de ruyter 's flagship , but the [ actual ship itself does not ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/model_zeven_provincien.jpg ) . 
  ca n't really expect accuracy from propaganda like this , i guess . 
  this poster appears to have been used to recruit dutch volunteers to the german kriegsmarine . 
  the german immigration he is talking about is older than the one you 're talking about , i think . 
  the great influx of german migrants was in the 19th and early 20th century and consisted of poor people , looking for a better life , not expats . 
  i 'm fairly certain his attitude is not shared by the majority of the people in the netherlands , flanders and suriname , though . 
  dutch is alive and well , there was very recent research done that corroborates that . 
  the influence of english may change the language somewhat , but languages are n't static anyway and constantly change . 
  it wo n't disappear , however . 
  english is a `` lazy language , '' as linguists often call it . 
  it requires not only less physical effort to speak it ( a major contributor to it being so widely spoken as a second language ) , but it is also less taxing on the brain ( often leading to what i like to call `` unexercised intelligence '' , which explains brexit and trump ) . 
  this all leads to less calories being burned by just thinking and talking , compared to other languages . 
  if they did n't compete , we probably would n't have had that streaker , though . 
  i think it 's standard dutch . 
  seems completely normal to me . 
   new zealand not a town , but an entire country named after a place in the netherlands . 
   seems like european countries always have beef with the accents of their languages developed in the americas . 
  i do n't think i 've ever heard anything negative about the surinamese dutch accent . 
  not beyond the patronising `` it sounds cute '' that people say about belgian dutch and several dutch dutch accents as well , anyway . 
  north america : do the caribbean nations count ? 
  not that i know anything about them . 
  the bahamas seem nice . 
  south america : chile europe : ireland africa : senegal or ethiopia , used to be mali , before shit hit the fan there . 
  i still want to go to bamako sometime . 
  asia : mongolia oceania : new zealand ( but i suspect micronesia to be awesome ), 
  quite far back . 
  i have one ancestor , mid 18th century , who appears to have come from just across the border in germany . 
  all other family lines i know of ( dating back as far as the 14th-18th century , depending on the line ) are purely dutch . 
  none of the names used at those points in time seem to be of foreign origin , so i assume they 've been here for a few centuries longer than that at the least . 
  at least my grandparents all came from different parts of the country . 
  still , not very exotic . 
  having tasted homemade palinka , i think our chances of survival are a lot greater without it . 
  \\* shake the plastic bottle a bit \\* `` look at the bubbles , probably around 65 % '' also , my experience was in bear country , in the middle of a forest in rural transylvania , to add to the bear talk elsewhere in this thread . 
  our only weapon was a drunk with an axe . 
  not that we were worried , we were drunk on homemade palinka after all . 
  you forgot one : van oranje/van amsberg ( netherlands ), 
  [ see here ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/mof ) . 
  the german page is missing another possible explanation , though , and that is that [ * bommen berend * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christoph_bernhard_von_galen ) 's invading soldiers wore [ muffs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muff_ ( handwarmer \\ ) ) , which the dutch found effeminate , so they started using it as a slur . 
  a long ago , dutch had the '' - er '' plural ending as well .
