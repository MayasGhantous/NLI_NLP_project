  it somehow disappeared though . 
  there are still remains of it in some words . 
  the word `` kind '' ( child ) for instance . 
  the plural used to be `` kinder '' , but once the '' - er '' plural ending was gone , that was n't recognised as a plural form anymore . 
  it got changed to `` kinderen '' , which is actually a double plural . 
  many dutch dialects still say `` kinder '' too . 
  come to think of it , it would n't surprise me if that 's how english got to their weird plural form `` children '' as well . 
  lots of water in my hometown of leiden , mostly in the form of canals . 
  there 's also a very slow-flowing branch of the rhine . 
  it splits up just to the east and joins up again in the centre . 
  [ aerial photo of the city centre . 
  it happened to my dad when i was a kid . 
  we were walking trough town , i was holding his hand , and some lady started screaming at him , calling him a pedophile . 
  she was known in the neighbourhood for being a bit crazy , though , so nothing came of it . 
  nope . 
  also , our peanut butter is not as sweet and creamy as yours . 
  it 's firmer and savory . 
  there were several aspects that made it a national trauma . 
  first of all , we , as a country , failed to protect the victims . 
  those soldiers were representatives of our whole nation and they could n't protect those thousands of innocents , so we as a nation could n't protect those thousands , even though we said we would . 
  then there 's the `` what would i have done , '' which suddenly became very difficult to answer , since we could see how terrified the dutch commander was in video footage . 
  that man was probably not a bad man , but he could not make the choice to stand up to the serbs and risk his and his soldier 's lives , even if it would have been the morally right choice . 
  that `` what would i have done '' question got closer than ever , the people making the choice were dutch and professional and we related more to them than my generation ever could with our grandparents ' generation in ww2 ( the last time dutch people were forced to make such moral choices ) . 
  the dutch outlook on the world as a whole changed . 
  up to then , we had this general idea that the world could be changed with good will and some effort . 
  people wanted to live better lives , and it was the obligation of the international community to provide the opportunity for that wherever peace was threatened . 
  and then a genocide happens , right under our noses , and the rest of the international community , especially our longtime allies the french , british and americans , suddenly were nowhere to be found and denied air support . 
  this is the reason why since the massacre , the dutch have not taken part in un peacekeeping missions , but only in nato operations where there was a clear mandate to use more force than initially agreed upon , if a situation was to change . 
  lastly , it simply felt like a huge blow to our international prestige . 
  the assassination of pim fortuyn in 2002 and the subsequent establishment of right-wing populism as a sizeable political group . 
  also , the srebrenica massacre in 1995 , which shaped dutch involvement in international military missions and has caused a national trauma here as well ( although undoubtedly of a different nature and magnitude than in bosnia ) . 
  leiden , the netherlands : sikhs are rare here . 
  i 've only ever seen one in leiden , who was leaving an administrative building of the university , dressed in a suit and tie , so not your typical tourist . 
  other than that , i do n't think sikhs are well known enough to be recognised as such by many people , so the beards may make them appear muslim to many . 
  the turban is not something that would be associated with our own local muslims , so i would n't be surprised if people thought you were both muslim and a tourist , if you wear one , but are otherwise dressed and acting touristy . 
  it looks a bit different from what i remember too , but writing was by far my absolute worst subject in school ( lousy fine motor skills ) , so my memory may have been tainted by my bad experience . 
  that lower-case t is what i was taught , although the crossed version ( as opposed to the looped one ) was taught in other schools as well . 
  another difference is the lower-case x , which i was taught to loop , [ like this ] ( https://storage.googleapis.com/quiver-one.appspot.com/image-book%2fproduction%2fthumbnails%2fworkshop-critiques-14-looped-x.jpg?googleaccessid=image-viewer@quiver-one.iam.gserviceaccount.com&amp;expires=1798761600&amp;signature=f%2b8isth9y8wphinwpew20y71hsy1zaf2fak1qiawlxktn3ptolbndjdqs%2fpxalttpkkg9q6l0dqjv%2bkbmtoejhgzwlxf0eyrvuypgu2f0mcx%2fcguhyu1zt3ufxezesmr2njmltlttm5ywe9fq4djdxlj%2fpjmsfvmfhh0c3yyanaoh4gopyfia0vdesdjoi5fz4mrl3uar5n6ei8il94dng0srf3ryxnixcqyt9dxuinddedig11whay3jz6wntfzje7m89w0z6hqypnpusxtd6y4rwuvldxlnrqeuli2wgiuplmsp89%2bjkqkunzy7bvhpp5j6vfum5hegcd1mlub9w%3d%3d ),

  [ example ] ( https://vrijeschoolpedagogie.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/dysgrafie-3.jpg ) . 
  so , all in all , pretty similar to what other countries teach . 
  apparently , the 1 does n't have a serif and the 7 is crossed , here . 
  thank goodness you 're learning a normal script nowadays . 
  i work with old handwritings and believe that the only good thing the nazis ever did was stop teaching [ this in school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s\u00fctterlin ) . 
  indonesian , especially rendang . 
  always my go to answer when people ask what they should eat in the netherlands , since it 's so easy to get here . 
  it 's not generally considered part of it , no . 
  modern usage of `` near east '' in dutch is generally reserved for scientific purposes . 
  i know the usage from my archaeology studies , myself . 
  in that context it makes sense to roughly use these borders , in stead of the modern national ones . 
  basically , the near east is the historical regions of the levant , mesopotamia and anatolia , which share a lot of history . 
  also , i did n't make the map , i just found it . 
  the saint nicholas chapel in nijmegen has already been linked to , but since people are doing their hometowns as well , the oldest building in leiden is the [ gravensteen ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/gravensteen_ ( leiden \\ ) ) from the early 13th century . 
  an honourable mention goes out to the [ burcht van leiden ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/burcht_van_leiden ) , from 1275 , but the motte it is located on was created in the 11th century ( the links are in dutch ) . 
  although * het nabije oosten * , the near east , also exists , but it has a narrower scope , as illustrated by [ this little map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/neareast.png ) ( near east in dark green ) . 
  yeah , it 's been researched before and i 've done some research myself . 
  the research on my surname is enough to fill up two books , but in my own research , i found those books to be wrong for my own direct male line . 
  i myself hit a brick wall because of an asshole preacher in the late 17th century in this little village , who decided that the only name he had to write down for a baptism was the father 's , without the surname , but with the patronym . 
  so , in stead of saying `` john , son of frank robertson smith and mary jacobsen miller '' , it just says `` a child of frank robertson '' . 
  no mother , no last name , not even the name and sex of the child . 
  so , i have no way of using those baptism records to get any further . 
  stupid preacher ... 
  some point in the future , could be 40 years from now , i 'll head on over to the regional archives and look for some other type of record . 
  i 'm just looking through digitalized records at the moment . 
  luckily , other branches have been a bit more fruitful and i 've managed to get to the 16th century with some of them . 
  there 's supposed to be a line that can be traced to the 13th or 14th century , but i have n't got around to checking that yet . 
  also , i have n't found a single interesting person so far . 
  no incest , no illegitimate children ( except my grandfather , but i knew that already ) , no child marriages , no criminal records , not even any poverty , just boring , god-fearing farmers . 
  yeah , we do , some bands like rowwen h\u00e8ze and normaal are quite well known and often sing in their local dialect . 
  this one is partly about the limburg language ( the chorus which is sung in normal dutch is : * it 's a matter of patience / waiting quietly for the day / that all of holland speaks limburgish * ) : [ rowwen h\u00e8ze - limburg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlw_1lypi5q ), 
  for more than 200 years [ scottish soldiers served the dutch republic . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scots_brigade ) you can still find scottish names with people who are descended from those that stayed here . 
  former footballer roy makaay , for instance ( = mackay ) . 
   the latin empire do you mean the roman empire ? 
  the [ latin empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_empire ) was a shortlived crusader state , which i doubt gets taught in school anywhere . 
  other than that , most of american history that i know about , i picked up outside of school . 
  colonial history in the netherlands focuses mostly on indonesia . 
  the american revolution is mentioned , but overshadowed by the french one , which had a larger influence here . 
  the civil war gets skipped , or lumped in with the general slavery stuff , although that focuses mainly on the dutch role in slavery . 
  ww1 is not a * huge * subject here ( we remained neutral ) and focuses on the european powers , mostly . 
  the great depression is taught , with the focus on the us and the new deal . 
  ww2 and the cold war are more focused on politics and society in germany and the soviet union respectively . 
  sure , if you want to use the modern name  i use `` northern netherlands '' to differentiate from the `` southern netherlands '' , i.e. 
  ( roughly ) belgium . 
  i do n't just say `` the netherlands '' , since in that time , that name would have incorporated both halves . 
  you 're right though , needlessly confusing , i 'll edit . 
  all of the netherlands was under habsburg rule at the time of bosch . 
  the duchy of brabant got divided up between the dutch republic and the kingdom of spain in the dutch revolt . 
  bosch 's hometown of 's - hertogenbosch ended up on the northern side . 
  the flemish * were * dutch at the time ( although we wo n't claim brueghel or van eyck ) , but even then , he was from 's - hertogenbosch , which ~ ~ is in the northern netherlands ~ ~ ended up in the dutch republic . 
  you may not want it to be , but it is . 
  anton mussert , nvu , stormfront and queen wilhelmina agree that it is . 
  if you can find a way to stop it being a fascist symbol , you have my support , but i do n't believe that ignoring the historical and current use is the way to go about that . 
   some designs in the netherlands sure , the design was used and [ that did n't stop ] ( http://cdn.betweters.nl/images/817496459a19f2d3c4c5978a20e01352.jpg ) after wwii either . 
  the colours are fine . 
  the flag , however , is n't . 
  fact is , the red-white-blue flag is older , it 's been used a lot more and it does n't have the fascist connotations of the prince 's flag . 
  i do n't understand why we should ignore all of that simply because it 's pretty . 
  it would just be a symbol , one for which we already have an older one ( that 's quite pretty in its own right ) . 
   in south african flag which is irrelevant .
