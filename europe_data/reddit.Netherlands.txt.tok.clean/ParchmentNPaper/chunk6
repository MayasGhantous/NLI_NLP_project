  south africa is welcome to use it , they have their own history with it , being started as a voc colony when the prince 's flag was used . 
  it wo n't have the connection to fascism there as it does here ( although it is often connected to apartheid in sa ) . 
  the same is true for new york city . 
  it did n't stand for anything in those hundreds of years . 
  we switched to the red-white-blue exclusively pretty early . 
  it was also already in use * before * the prince 's flag . 
  our current flag simply has much more history than the orange-white-blue , however nice it may be aesthetically . 
  so yeah , we rightfully connect that one to its most recent use , which was as a fascist symbol . 
  most of our pms were the parliamentary leader for their respective parties when they became pm . 
  they have also usually held cabinet positions . 
  piet de jong ( no parliamentary position ) and jan peter balkenende ( no cabinet position ) are two exceptions . 
  the pms for the last 50 years were : * piet de jong * ( 1967 - 1971 ) - junior minister of defense , minister of defense . 
  other experience : military ( naval captain ) ; * barend biesheuvel * ( 1971 - 1973 ) - minister of agriculture and fisheries/minister for surinamese and netherlands antillean affairs/deputy prime minister , parliamentary leader ( arp ) . 
  other experience : studied law , board member in several agricultural organisations , mep ; * joop den uyl * ( 1973 - 1977 ) - minister of economic affairs , parliamentary leader ( pvda ) . 
  other experience : studied economics , amsterdam city council , amsterdam administrator of economic affairs ; * dries van agt * ( 1977 - 1982 ) - minister of justice/deputy prime minister . 
  other experience : studied law , lawyer , university teacher , civil servant ; * ruud lubbers * ( 1982 - 1994 ) - minister of economic affairs , parliamentary leader ( cda ) . 
  other experience : studied economics , took over his father 's business ; * wim kok * ( 1994 - 2002 ) - parliamentary leader ( pvda ) , minister of finance/deputy prime minister . 
  other experience : studied business administration , union leader ; * jan peter balkenende * ( 2002 - 2010 ) - parliamentary leader ( cda ) . 
  other experience : studied and achieved a ph.d. in law , professor of christian theology , amstelveen council member ; * mark rutte * ( 2010 - present ) - junior minister of education , culture and science , parliamentary leader ( vvd ) . 
  other experience : studied history , leader of vvd 's youth organisation , worked in the hr department of unilever . 
  edit : so , to summarise , of these 8 , when they became prime minister : - 5 were parliamentary leaders ; - 3 were cabinet members . 
  historically , for leiden , it would be the [ blue stone ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/blauwe_steen_ ( leiden \\ ) ) ( dutch wikipedia ) , which is situated at the center point of the four oldest neigbourhoods of the city . 
  there are also a [ red stone ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/rode_steen_ ( leiden \\ ) ) and a [ white stone ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/witte_steen_ ( leiden \\ ) ) . 
  they were possibly used to denote judicial districts , with the blue stone being the place for justice by the [ poorter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poorter ) leadership , the red stone for justice by the clergy , and the white stone for justice by the nobility ( notably the burgraves of leiden ) . 
  another central point could be the [ burcht ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burcht_van_leiden ) , the keep of leiden , situated at the confluence of the old and new rhine . 
  [ and here 's a beautiful old map ruined by my own additions to show the points i mentioned ] ( http://imgur.com/3awctxh ), 
  my home city of leiden was first mentioned in 860 ad and received city rights in 1266 , according to wikipedia . 
  http://www.funda.nl/ is by far the biggest website . 
  thorbecke was a head of government , though , as he was prime minister twice . 
  although his most famous achievement , the constitutional reform , happened when he had no ministerial post . 
  another one for the netherlands could be [ hugo de groot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hugo_grotius ) , who is seen as the father of international law . 
  furthermore , although less succesfully , he was very active in the arminianism-calvinism debate of the early 17th century , for which he was jailed . 
  two more . 
  firstly , [ thomas \u00e0 kempis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_%c3%a0_kempis ) , born in germany , but raised and educated in the east of the netherlands . 
  his writings had a large influence on the reformation , which , i believe , should count as politics as well . 
  secondly , \u00e0 kempis ' great influence [ geert grote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geert_groote ) , who founded the [ modern devotion movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devotio_moderna ) which , among more mystical pursuits , organised education for the masses , thus influencing the reformation as well . 
  and now we just call him willy . 
  some other dutch kings : - [ louis napoleon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_bonaparte ) , napoleon 's brother . 
  louis was very popular and created an acceptance of monarchies , which allowed the current dynasty to return from exile as kings . 
  before that , we were a republic ( with , eventually , a hereditary head of state , make of that what you will ) ; - [ philip ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philip_ii_of_spain ) , king of spain . 
  the king of spain is honoured in our national anthem , the [ wilhelmus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wilhelmus ) . 
  oh yeah , the wilhelmus was written when we were revolting * against * spanish rule ; - [ william ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_ii_of_holland ) , count of holland and king of germany . 
  yes , king of germany . 
  sure , there was still an emperor who disagreed , but he was excommunicated , so who cares ; - [ redbad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/redbad,_king_of_the_frisians ) , king of the frisians , who supposedly refused to become a christian , because he would rather live in hell with his honourable ancestors than go to heaven with a parcel of beggars . 
  [ the world 's oldest boat . 
  oh definitely , there was some great art , science and political ideas coming out of the netherlands in that time , so i would n't want to diminish your admiration . 
  just pointing out that there were still plenty of issues to resolve and that the dutch republic was a * relative * paradise at best , not an absolute one . 
  which , reading back , you already pretty much said yourself with the `` for its time '' part . 
  then again , the 1700s were not a great time to be a catholic with any kind of ambitions in the netherlands . 
  they ( and many other people who did not follow the state religion ) were all but banned from holding public office . 
  the catholic province of brabant and the parts of the current province of limburg that were then part of the republic had no self-governance or official representation . 
  sure , catholics were n't put to the torch , but they sure as hell were n't free . 
  also , before blaming the catholic church , do n't forget that the french revolution brought about some much-needed changes in much of europe , at a time when the protestant netherlands had become a mere shadow of its former self . 
  i 'm quite willing to admit the revolution happened * despite * of the catholic church -- they were one of the revolution 's targets after all -- but it did happen in a catholic nation . 
  i would argue that the unique 1700s dutch political and social mindset was a result of the unusually high degree of urbanisation ( which diminished the powerbase of the more rural centered nobility , that mostly continued to be in power in the rest of europe for another 200 years or so ) , more than of religion ( which will have played a role as well , of course ) . 
  similar to how in the middle ages the italian city states were socially and culturally much more `` advanced '' compared to much of the rest of europe . 
  ah , cheese , great stuff . 
  almost everywhere in europe you can find some great cheeses . 
  i would n't know about my favourite one , but i will try to find some local cheese whenever i am abroad . 
  one cheese i can remember was in romania . 
  i had visited some castle which was reqlly just a tourist trap , surrounded by stands selling overpriced dracula souvenirs , but there were also some small stands which sold some kind of cheap sheep 's cheese . 
  it smelled of sheep and as such i was n't looking forward to actually eating it , but back in my hostel in brasov , my friends and i gave it a go . 
  i have to say , it was indeed an acquired taste , but i acquired it very quickly . 
  after eating about half of it , i stored the rest of it in the hostel 's fridge , which is not something you should ever do if you want to see it again . 
  so yeah , i have a soft spot for unnamed romanian sheep 's cheese of unclear origin . 
  ` et-teken ' is not something i have ever heard use , but the other two are . 
  ` en-teken ' is by far the most common of those two . 
  it is , bikes that cheap are sold by junkies at train stations . 
  many people who buy them have had their own bikes stolen , so it 's a market that creates itself . 
  dutch entrepeneurship at its finest . 
  yes , those are two of the dialects i was talking about later in my post , thank you for the examples . 
  as you 'll see in the titles of the wiki pages however , neither of those dialects is called just `` flemish '' , both of them have an adjective . 
  / u/rafarealness appeared to be talking about a monolithic flemish language and that simply does not exist , not as a language and not as a dialect . 
  the only language or dialect that is spoken in all of flanders ( apart from migrants ' ones , of course ) is dutch , just like it is in the netherlands . 
   they have their own language called flemish flemish is not a language . 
  it 's not even a dialect . 
  it 's an accent , just like what we speak north of the border is an accent . 
  there are plenty of dialects in flanders that can differ quite a lot from standard dutch , so maybe you 're thinking about that , but flemish as a whole is standard dutch . 
  if someone is planning on visiting the veluwe , be sure to check out the [ kr\u00f6ller-m\u00fcller museum ] ( http://krollermuller.nl/visit ) . 
  it 's really great , but a bit out of the way of the most touristy places in the country . 
  lots of van gogh paintings too , which tourists ( understandably ) seem to like . 
  they got that quote from a letter he had written to his sister a few months earlier . 
  a suicide bomber , and we 're still naming naval vessels after him . 
  [ yes they did . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_armada ), 
  yes , it did . 
  it raised awareness in the netherlands of the corruption and oppression happening in the east indies . 
  up until the publishing of this book , most people were not really concerned with what was going on in the colonies . 
  they were little more than a source of some national pride for most . 
  max havelaar changed the public opinion ( and with it the politics ) on the role of the dutch in the east . 
  the first thing that comes to mind is gerard reve 's 1947 debut novel [ * de avonden * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_avonden ) ( * the evenings * ) . 
  it 's set in the period immediately following wwii and follows a young man as he goes through his days . 
  it is very bleak and supposedly perfectly captures the emptiness of the period , which marked a generation . 
  the second thing to come to mind is another novel , multatuli 's [ * max havelaar * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/max_havelaar ) from 1860 , which strongly critizes dutch colonial policy in the east indies and influenced the way they were governed for decades to come . 
  the last thing is for my own generation , and it 's a cartoon from the late 80s/early 90s . 
  even though the artwork is japanese , [ * alfred j. kwak * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred_j._kwak ) is as dutch as it gets . 
  the protagonist even lives in a clog . 
  it never shunned big subjects , despite being for kids . 
  in fact , it sought them out . 
  it has taught my generation about big subjects like death , fascism , racism and the environment , without ever feeling heavy-handed .
