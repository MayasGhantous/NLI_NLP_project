on a rock in complete vacuum , 500 million kilometers from earth . 
  i think i can guarantee enthousiastic support, 
  sorry about that . 
  maybe in a decade or so we 'll be ready for the idea . 
  they 'd be entitled to more or less the voting strength of germany + france ... 
  i do n't see that happening, 
   in fact , every minister give a letter of resignation to the prime minister and the prime minister the same to the president the day they take office is this legal , in france of all places ? 
  you 're right , albania was granted eu candidate status [ in june ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-14-439_en.htm ), 
  you 're now the support , the upholder , the defender , the hero of the bulgarians , your fortune is made and your glory is assured '', 
  i 'm no expert on israeli politics , but it seems safe to ignore him . 
  it appears his party lost 90 % ( ! ), 
  in the 2013 elections . 
  kadima now has 2 seats and is in the opposition, 
  you do realise that they almost certainly thought that they were shooting at a military plane right ? 
  it 'd be the poorest country within the eu , with the lowest gdp/capita . 
  the average wage in albania is about half poland 's , only bulgaria gets close to the same level . 
  the average wage in the netherlands is 6x higher . 
  nice for albania and all , but this deal is getting worse all the time, 
  you do , but you 're not allowed to know what they are, 
  treeson, 
  it 's the same thing , from ukip 's point of view the problem is that british workers now have to compete with cheap labour from outside the uk because of the eu . 
  no eu -  no cheap labour competition -  uk workers hired . 
  because the british press got beaten by foreign competition on price and/or quality , which sort of underlines ukip 's point . 
  exactly the response the writer intends, 
  it should be noted that just about all city centres are designated as a ` high-risk ' area nowadays allowing such searches - after approval of the officier van justitie ( district attorney ) - and that the ` temporary ' measure is always renewed . 
  we 're talking about searches without a reason for suspicion of involvement in a crime here , else different rules would apply . 
  dutch people are ok with this generally , there 's a lot of trust in police and government, 
  i do n't think an ` own ' country is compatible with roma culture, 
  because moldova 's gdp/capita is less than 1/10th of germany 's ? 
  i wonder how they will define that minimum wage , given the difference in living standards and cost of living within the eu, 
  i guess they 'd have a hard time convincing italians that what starbucks sells qualifies as coffee, 
  probably for the best , we ca n't afford them, 
  expansion with what , belarus ? 
  should have thought about that 10 years ago, 
  i must have missed it when that happened, 
  the 1997 agreement does include prevention of the buildup of forces in central and eastern europe . 
  however , it also requires relations based on `` respect for sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of all states '' and '' refraining from the threat or use of force against each other as well as against any other state '' . 
  ~ ~ i 'm confused . 
  russia considers the referendum invalid ? 
  does this mean there will be a new one , or do they consider a referendum irrelevant ? ~ ~ * edit : i read that wrong ... russia rejected the un document , not the referendum . 
  that makes a lot more sense, 
  other sources : http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-14-213_en.htm http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-14-307_en.htm?locale=fr http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/piebalgs/headlines/news/2014/03/20140324_en.htm as to why the 2.5 bn :  bilateral cooperation with countries in latin america  in line with the agenda for change , the eu 's new policy blueprint to refocus its aid by priortising those sectors and countries where the need is greatest , the eu is setting up a new way to work with latin america . 
  for those countries which are facing the greatest challenges , bilateral cooperation will remain significant . 
  but for those partner countries or regions where bilateral development cooperation is being discontinued , the eu will now be free to engage in a more strategic relationship , in which it seeks solutions on matters of common concern via regional cooperation , thematic programmes and new financial instruments . 
  that 's why the eu 's regional funding will see such a significant increase ; ( nearly double ) on amounts spent 2007 -- 2013 . 
  so it looks to me like a redistribution of existing development aid programmes ( probably not an increase ), 
  58 % gas ; 22 % coal ; biofuels not mentioned ( ? ) . 
  still , it 's clear we 're not leading on renewable energy, 
  should n't we be offering to station troops in ukraine ? 
  ^ not ^ ours ^ of ^ course , ^ we ^ sold ^ our ^ tanks, 
  i 'm sure the tourists wo n't mind , no one comes to malta to look at some water . 
  nothing to preserve there, 
  do we know yet if the voting will be anonymous , and whether there will be international observers ? 
  aside from the illegal trade , why is this being legislated on a european level ? 
  the french came up with a working [ solution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guillotine ) 2-3 centuries ago though ( of course , there are many other reasons against the death penalty for which this does n't make a difference ), 
  [ lola rennt ( 1998 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130827/ ) will probably never leave my top 10, 
  by the way , aljazeera 's headline is different . 
  changed after link ? 
  thanks for the info , i wo n't pretend i understand all of it but your comment does help a lot !, 
  it seems a sensible arangement to me . 
  bankrupting people does n't help the new bank and there were exceptional circumstances which allows considering the forgiving of debt . 
  foreign investors probably got screwed though and i can imagine some icelanders not wanting to pay more tax for someone else 's debt . 
  i do n't know the mood in iceland on this subject of course , comments in that article appear to be mostly hate towards banks so i assume some angry protesting preceded this proposal . 
  i do n't get it . 
  how can the goverment do this , are all mortgages in iceland owned by the government ? 
  are n't there protests from people without a mortgage , who 'd end up paying for this ? 
  an outstanding balance of 30 million isk is 265 000 eur . 
  are you saying that any outstanding mortgage under that amount is n't affected , making this a massive subsidy for rich people ? 
  according to wikipedia soliciting , procuring or operating a brothel is illegal at the moment ( before this law goes into effect ) . 
  does n't that make prostitution effectively already illegal in france ? 
  i agree . 
  let 's make free sex mandatory, 
  aside from people being sensible by creating a buffer in uncertain times , for the most part people just spend less because they have less to spend ( no wage increase , higher costs of living and/or unemployment will do that ), 
  we pretend it does n't exist, 
  love the red vs. blue in this picture . 
  i 'm willing to believe there 's a lot more pro-eu sentiment in moldova than pro-communist sentiment , but : - right side has a favourable crop - perspective is more favourable on the right side ( less foreshortening ) - left side has poor weather - we do n't know if both pictures were taken at the time of peak attendance also as a dutch person i do n't understand what motivates people to voluntarily attend pro-government ( or pro * anything * ) rallies . 
  looks suspicious to me , we only go to demonstrations if we 've got something to complain about . 
  wait , you can get speeches from 2010 ? 
  browsing conservatives.com or labour.org.uk , i 'm unable to even find current policies ... 
  engineer here . 
  toughness does not hinder bending over easily, 
  it 's not quite [ that bad ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/07/us-usa-security-snowden-germany-idusbre9a60w920131107 ) , but i guess a lot of germans fear that claiming it 's up to them to protect us citizens from the us government will cause more problems than it solves . 
  do they ? 
  it is my impression that this report is a research report to provide a committee of meps with information , not a resolution, 
  `` the court will hold an additional hearing , behind closed doors , a day earlier '' wtf ? 
  [ spain can deal with the nsa ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rx9umhm.jpg ), 
  following the links does lead to a [ government document ] ( https://www.bof.nl/live/wp-content/uploads/20130426-eenmeting-toezicht-dataretentie.pdf ) . 
  problem appears to be that the law does not require companies to destroy the data if they collect it for commercial purposes . 
  in addition , small providers appear to have bad security practices and often are not aware of their obligations for data security . 
  this knowledge is not the result of a thorough independent investigation , most of the info was simply given by the providers in a questionairre . 
  i suppose we could fine every black person wearing a funny hat, 
  pen and paper , hollow spaces under floorboards, 
  you seem to end an extraordinary amount of posts with an exclamation mark . 
  where does all this frustration come from ? 
  sounds like the commission/barroso finally thinks a response to critique is necessary ( and even admits mistakes ! ) . 
  attempts at deregulation fail for most governments though , even if barosso really does mean to scale down . 
  would be nice if i got proven wrong and the eu manages to pull it off , and it turns out to be more than a repeat of empty words, 
  i love that they added that failed restoration of jesus ' fresco in the strip of holograms . 
  that would be fortunate , since i understand they ca n't fly either, 
  very nice topic !,
