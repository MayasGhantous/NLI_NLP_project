  it 's been a while since i 've listened to these ... *** the netherlands *** herman van veen - [ anne ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=een4gxzvs4q ) herman van veen - [ zo vrolijk ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt5-rf4nqsg ) herman van veen - [ toveren ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlkj6qxflua ) doe maar - [ de bom ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxwdqgtl6qs ) hans de booij - [ annabel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn35xo29m2e ) bloem - [ even aan mijn moeder vragen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-1scbfzrpw ) het goede doel - [ vriendschap ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_wshzx1qyy ) rene froger & het goede doel - [ alles kan een mens gelukkig maken ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h_cqckr7kc ) het goede doel is belgian i think , but most of the music i can recognise from the 80s is in english ... ours is not a very poetic language . 
  i wonder if non-dutch people would appreciate herman van veen though, 
  we will sail up the thames and take their ships, 
  the independent has an [ article ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uks-gchq-blamed-for-cyber-attack-on-belgian-telecoms-company-8830123.html ) . 
  i agree though you 'd expect to see this on the front page . 
  i do n't see anything on the bbc site , and not even on the guardian 's site . 
  maybe they 're slow to copy news from belgium ? 
  `` in europe , every opinion gets a fair chance '' so basically `` your vote matters '' . 
  to me many of the topics seem chosen to say that if you are disturbed by current events or policies , this is even more true . 
  the ` autocracy ' question was one question among many . 
  people were asked whether they agreed with : * ` the netherlands needs a strong leader that can make decisions about everything quickly ' * nice that they linked to the research report . 
  for those not able to speak dutch , they tried to research the relation between emotion and political preference . 
  they conclude ( strong simplification ) that voters drifted to protest parties not so much out of fears ( like for the future in the economic crisis or fear of immigrants ) but more out of anger about the policies of the ruling parties . 
  there 's medion i guess ( german ) . 
  packard bell is n't dutch as far as i know . 
  maybe european companies focused to much on the european market , which is more fractured with different regulations for every country ? 
  for some reason i have a hard time believing sweden will transport 2 million refugees + families to sweden . 
  something is missing ... does this only apply to syrians that already have a temporary permit ? 
  if you 're not certain sure you can make the situation better , stay out of it . 
  you only cause people to suffer and die when you bomb stuff , and usually not the people you 're after, 
  worth noting : in theory , all ( nearly all ? ), 
  medical insurance cooperations in holland like univ\u00e9 and achmea are non-profit organisations . 
  how this is possible when they are linked to other companies i do n't know , but i assume politicians have not been * that * stupid . 
  could they be worried about other ewa 's from before 2002 ? 
  is the average croat afraid that talking about the yugoslav time or the yugoslav war could stirr up tentions again ? 
  in his defense , it 's unlikely that those loans will be paid back in full . 
  also , the interest rate was lowered several times . 
  politicians in our country refuse to admit that that is the same as giving money away , which is a constant source of frustration . 
  i suspect those are ( very bad ) loans ; greece 's current total public debt stands at about 300-350 billion . 
  i expect a gift of 100 billion would fix their economy at the moment * if * ` we ' can afford it and are willing to pay that much in the middle of a crisis , except other countries are likely to follow . 
  it would be pretty shitty towards cyprus now too , but i really do n't see any other realistic option . 
  it 's super effective !, 
  maybe they were just unexplained paid numbers on the phone bill , and they had to come up with something, 
  not today though , the council of europe is not part of the eu, 
  if our governments suck up to yours , it must be your fault somehow !, 
  lots of funny dialects, 
  this is something that 's often overlooked by those making a comfortable salary . 
  no matter how educated you are , how hard you work , how clever you are : there are at least 10 indians ( / romanians ) that are better than you and who would work at a fraction of the cost . 
  too late now . 
  what a surprise . 
  good for them . 
  let 's not forget though that latvia 's gdp per capita is not awesome , beating romania and hungary but not much else . 
  maybe you should have chosen a username that hints at sarcasm, 
  obviously finland has lots of vigilantes, 
  pretty misleading title ( not tuesias 's fault ) , since extradition is for now not blocked but delayed . 
  the echr has accepted the case but has n't made a judgement yet ( and probably wo n't for 2 years or more ), 
  huh , what , greece repaid 50 billion ? 
  that seems unlikely . 
  is n't that difference because of the debt restructuring in 2012 ( which included a + / -50 % default on privately held debt ) ? 
  i wonder if kolab or neomailbox are a proper if expensive alternative , or simply just another ripoff . 
  they claim a lot of protection under swiss law, 
  and ethics . 
  germany was one of the few countries that held its ground when the 2nd iraq war was pushed, 
  it immediately got run over by a car , got cut to pieces and got it 's empty fur displayed on national tv in the kids ' news . 
  we probably should add 2 towers to our flag, 
  or being granted immunity in the us , which would be by far preferable, 
  could well be a good proposal , just be careful not to simply replace affordable connections with fast ones, 
  my personal objection : because you ca n't see if/when/by whom you 're being watched , and ca n't punch them if they 're annoying you . 
  it 's the case with police helicopters as well , but we do n't use those a lot except in exceptional circumstances ( too expensive ... ) . 
  the same is true for any cctv system , but i do n't like those either . 
  if you do n't want the eu to handle a specific subject though , it 's not very helpful or logical to take part in discussions on * how * they should handle it, 
  if they do , who is going to represent the people that want the eu to reduce its ambitions ? 
  does that automated system work by now though , and is snooping before the conversation is deleted impossible ? 
  ` the decision to use telephone and internet taps is always taken with a great deal of care ' ... 
  which amazingly does n't prevent them from illegally listening in on lawyer 's communications . . by default . 
  unfortunately the law never seems to have applied to phone / internet tapping in the netherlands . 
  it used to be that at the end of an investigation , those who were tapped had to be informed that they had been under surveillance . 
  this happened in exactly 0 cases . 
  reason given ? 
  that they were unable to locate the people under surveillance ... 
  in the meantime the law has probably changed so they do n't have to anymore . 
  they probably only spy if they have at least a 51 % belief that it 's not industry related, 
  i 'd turn that around and say she 's not saying anything ; she does n't care and certainly is n't going to do or demand anything . 
  which is no worse than any other european pm or president i guess, 
  as far as i know that still works . 
  it 's quite a bit of hassle and paperwork , but the way i understand it : prices are lower outside of holland for both new and 2nd hand cars mostly because no bpm tax has to be paid there ( bpm = about 40 % for a new car ) . 
  import a 2nd hand car and you still have to pay part of the tax , but not all . 
  owning and driving any car in holland is very expensive , a couple will argue about what car to get . 
  practical arguments tend to be more effective than simply ` it looks cool ' . 
  if a couple has kids or has some on the way their next car is going to be a station wagon so they can take all their stuff with them on holidays . 
  ironically , providers are legally required to store that data because of the eu . 
  every eu country ( except possibly germany , but i doubt it ) does the same ... 
  we 'd expect some trade deals in return though . 
  we 're not savages, 
  i kinda get the impression snowden wants to make a point this way, 
  i doubt it , it 'd mean they 'd have to pay import tax every time they drink an expensive wine . 
  i 'll do it, 
  it 's a map with colours , that 's enough to form an opinion ( i would appreciate it as well if someone could answer these questions ), 
  would n't it be better if people and businesses would simply encrypt data before sending it to a third party no matter where it is stored , and if somekind of onion-routed encrypted mail system replaced the one we use now ? 
  i think that placing trust in a european government rather than the us one is missing the point . 
  the point should n't be which field you like , but which would benefit more from a european approach than a national one and which you would prefer to be done by the eu and where ( more ) investment would help . 
  if only it was a matter of ` waking up ', 
  it does mean a searchable internet history and allows mapping of social contacts . 
  that makes you - or any dissenter , or anyone in a position of importance - more vulnerable than you might think . 
  also any vague suspicion that will come up could be used to authorize a full tap which is a bit of a hobby in the netherlands . 
  appears to reference this : [ the 2008 belgium cell and fata 's terrorist pipeline ] ( http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-2008-belgium-cell-and-fata%e2%80%99s-terrorist-pipeline ) ( by the way : while people trained at afghan/pakistani camps appear to have been involved , footnote 60 says no explosives , firearms , or attack blueprints were recovered ... ), 
  am i missing something ? 
  `` the press has long reported a sum of # 25,000 '' claiming anyone could collect 25,000 per year in benefits anywhere in the world is absurd . 
  just a conservative check with numbers from one or two internets : uk job seeker 's allowance max 102 x 52 = 5300 uk child benefits ( 4 children ) 52 x ( 20.30 +13.40 x3 ) = 3150 total = 8450, 
  i think it 's some kind of cinderella effect,
