  some people may think they are anonymous, 
  yes . 
  one big happy europe with romanian living standards for all . 
  this is just fooling around with the photoshop slider, 
  ecb report can be found [ here ] ( http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/ecbsp2en.pdf ) do n't draw conclusions from these figures quickly . 
  for the netherlands for example , this does n't include pension funds . 
  it does n't say too much about living standards and '' net wealth '' does not cover things like the availability of healthcare , social security etc, 
  there is an alternative if you 're no expert in the field ( which is nearly always , else you 'd have done it yourself ) : relying on the reputation . 
  unfortunately it 's easy to invite corruption if you let a government do that, 
  security is in for a bad day ... 
  thanks for pointing that one out . 
  i get the impression wsj realized their article had no substance and changed it , but failed to remove that pointless paragraph : browser still calls the wsj article `` portugal seeks new options for budget '' when the title is `` portugal seeks new cuts to stay on course '' . 
  i guess i 'm in a generous mood today, 
  1 ) the reasoning i heard most often is because if greece is allowed to default then spain , portugal , ireland and italy would follow . 
  i 'm told this would kill whatever is left of the european economy . 
  2 ) greece has already defaulted on part of its debt ( but not sufficiently to get out of the mess ) 3 ) several tricks have been thought up that amount to a partial default , like reduction of interest ( but not sufficiently to get out of the mess ) . 
  the reason for those tricks is our politicians have repeatedly claimed the money lent to greece will be repaid , which no sane person believes . 
  according to this article , [ several ` centre left ' members of the european council , aka heads of government ] ( http://euobserver.com/institutional/29022 ) sadly , i have no idea who exactly they were . 
  nomination for the previous position ( commissioner of trade ) was done [ by the prime minister of the uk ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-08-1459_en.htm ), 
  cretans vs. cretins , someone make this game, 
  actually , for a huge part of the building code you are allowed to build with a much lower quality if you are renovating . 
  it 's more complicated though , and the owners of office blocks have no idea how the housing market works ( if it works at all at the moment ) . 
  mayors can use an apv ( ` general police order ' ) to name a certain area an ` increased risk for safety ' which allows ` preventief fouilleren ' ( random searches ) . 
  in theory , there has to be an actual increased risk of violence but in practice there 's no proof required whatsoever . 
  in theory , an apv is temporary , but a mayor can set one for 1,000 years if he wants to and in case of cameras in inner cities for instance , when an apv runs out they are * always * renewed . 
  statement of the eurogroup : http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/136487.pdf bottom of the page , no . 
  you all realize this means the eu will require porn to be pixelated right, 
  i personally do n't consider machiavelli to be a very good role model, 
  thanks . 
  so i just proposed something going around the world as the worst eu plan of the decade . 
  i 'll go hide now, 
  are you certain about this ? 
  none of the articles i can find say depositors would get anything in return , they just call it tax in return for recapitalization of the banks . 
  man you reply fast . 
  best as i can recall my comment : * it seems unfair for the greeks to pay any interest on loans in a desperate situation , but from our point of view the interest is fictional because the greeks will never be able to repay those loans in full ; it 's only there as an excuse used to hide the flow of money to greece from our population . 
  * -- please do n't call people bigoted/racist just because they do n't agree with you . 
  also , of course austerity is part of the design , the eu believes that 's the way to balance a budget and it does n't want the money to be completely wasted . 
  what else do you expect them to do , just hand over sacks of cash and hope for the best ? 
  i wonder if it would be workable instead of using a direct tax , to convert a fixed % of the savings ( say , 10 % ) to newly emitted shares . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boxer_%28animal_farm%29 ), 
  for the existing mortgages , because of the tax-deductability and our welfare system , paying these high mortgages is usually no problem except in cases of divorce or long-term unemployment . 
  that tax-deductability did lead to inflated housing prices and it 's a good thing it 's being addressed now . 
  the odd thing though is we are seeing a sharp drop in house prices ( because of changed tax rules ) , but at the same time we can expect a huge housing shortage 5-10 years from now because no one is building anything . 
  i 'm sure we can find new ways to motivate them, 
  * an excuse to hand out loads of ridiculously high paid jobs to political friends, 
  interesting article about the good old days , when hitting children and wives was proper and when you still got your sex ed in boarding schools or at confession . 
  perhaps brussels is actually cautions of inviting a country with less than a third the gdp per capita of italy or spain into the eu , in the middle of a crisis . 
  one can only hope . 
  i expect certain bits are , but that those are not the parts that end up in lasagna, 
  `` the bullet flew past my right ear , after which i attacked him and punched him in the face , which made him lose the gun '' you do n't mess with vikings, 
  - von clausewitz seriously though i think it is kind of worrying the eu wants to commit to a military expedition , just cause or not . 
  when did that become one the eu 's responsibilities ? 
  some of this statement may be correct . 
  some of the few examples of metabolism then ... probably on a unesco list somewhere . 
  they wo n't be pulled down , sorry !, 
  i 'm kinda surprised at this as well , maybe it 's people that read only the bold and italic sentence and misinterpret it . 
  depends a lot on what you like to do !, 
  even rotterdam can be awesome if you 're not looking for snapshots ( go to delft just around the corner or one of the many cities with a historical centre instead for that ) . 
  there 's a good high-speed railway to brussels and paris ( thalys ) . 
  in the hague itself : if you 're in the city centre , be sure to walk through the `` binnenhof '' . 
  at night you should probably check out the square on the other side of parliament and maybe visit the `` paard van troje '' if you like dancing ( although it 's far better go to amsterdam with someone that knows the city of course ), 
  unfortunately , the migrants ' countries of origin have joined the eu during the investigation so they had to let everyone go, 
  just to put this into perspective , even if a referendum is forced parliament can and will choose to ignore it, 
  nice chart , though i 'd have chosen gdp/population . 
  if i was n't too lazy to make charts that is, 
  just how left are the coalition of the radical left , are we talking about near-communists ? 
  a name like that is like an application to the terrorist watch list ... 
  i just assumed it worked with discount coupons for every law or something, 
  i see an impressive lady fighting off a horse with a whip . 
  looks very nice though, 
  iraq was protested a lot actually ( 3 million protesters in rome for one ) it 's just that western politicians are no longer scared of protests . 
  what does that bird have to do with the uk ? 
  ( the flying one , not the queen ), 
  official income tax tariff is maxed out at 52 % for income above 55k . 
  what 's actually paid gets complicated fast with all the subsidies and expceptions, 
  i hope cases such as these will get some convictions and publicity , it 's do greece 's reputation a lot of good, 
  do you have one or two examples of high-profile cases that resulted in prison sentences ? 
  i never saw examples of it in dutch media, 
  they used mario 's archived signature from when he was 5 years old, 
  aside from that i do n't believe in the idea of ` creating ' jobs , the problem with exceptions is that rich people are very good at abusing them . 
  the fewer exceptions the better , i 'd prefer to limit the tax rate in that case . 
  `` in which we led europe step by step out of the euro crisis '' the crisis is over !, 
  this guy sure knows what he 's talking about, 
  i 'm referring to this part , which happened after his 23 day interrogation in skopje : '' `` on 23 january 2004 , mr el-masri , handcuffed and blindfolded , was taken to skopje airport , where he was severely beaten by disguised men . 
  he was stripped of his clothes , then sodomised with an object and later placed in a nappy and dressed in a tracksuit . 
  shackled and hooded , and subjected to total sensory deprivation , he was forcibly taken to an aircraft , which was surrounded by macedonian security agents . '', 
  but they did in skopje, 
  press release of the court [ here ] ( http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/fra-press/pages/search.aspx?i=003-4196815-4975517# { % 22itemid % 22 :[ % 22003-4196815-4975517 % 22 ] } ), 
  press release of the court [ here ] ( http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/fra-press/pages/search.aspx?i=003-4196815-4975517# { % 22itemid % 22 :[ % 22003-4196815-4975517 % 22 ] } ) `` mr el-masri 's treatment at skopje airport at the hands of the cia rendition team -- being severely beaten , sodomised , shackled and hooded , and subjected to total sensory deprivation -- ... '' '' ... small , dirty , dark concrete cell in a brick factory near kabul , where he was repeatedly interrogated and was beaten , kicked and threatened . 
  his repeated requests to meet with a representative of the german government were ignored '' `` used with premeditation , the aim being to cause mr el-masri severe pain or suffering in order to obtain information '' `` a claim filed in the united states in december 2005 ( ... ) final with the us supreme court 's refusal to review the case in october 2007 , stated in particular that the state 's interest in preserving state secrets outweighed mr el-masri 's individual interest in justice . '', 
  `` a criminal complaint lodged by mr el-masri 's representative in october 2008 in `` the former yugoslav republic of macedonia '' against unidentified law-enforcement officials on account of his unlawful detention and abduction was dismissed by the skopje public prosecutor in december 2008 . '', 
  `` the court held that `` the former yugoslav republic of macedonia '' was to pay mr el-masri 60,000 euros ( eur ) in respect of non-pecuniary damage . '', 
  ---------------------- seriously , this is what passes for justice ? 
  i guess we should be grateful for the german bundestag 's war trauma , else this would have been completely swept under the carpet . 
  the corporation ( technically not the government ) is not building mosques here but offering their members a choice on how to change their home . 
  the corporation 's houses are rented so it 's generally not allowed to make significant changes . 
  a lot of these homes are out of date ( poorly insulated , bathroom too small etc ) so the houses are being renovated and brought more up to date . 
  the corporation has done a bit of research on changes that their members would like , or simply asked them . 
  after this they have proposed their members a few options for renovation . 
  the problem is that there is a fear in holland that we 're being ` taken over ' by radical , violent , non-dutch speaking and poor muslims , which gets stuff like this hyped .
