  they 're not important in parliament though . 
  i do n't see them becoming important either if their most charismatic man leaves and their new course is to `` steer away from the temptation of becoming an angry nativist party '' . 
  it 's the * united kingdom independence party * !, 
  of course , i 'm not a brit . 
  maybe i just misunderstand why people voted ukip . 
  or maybe farage found a horse 's head in his bed recently . 
  in return , charging poles will be added near your home so you can charge your hybrid or tax-exempt tesla !, 
  or maybe had legitimate concerns that make more sense than the highlighted silliness of the campaigns . 
  rules like this will bend under pressure anyway , the ecb is n't allowed to print euros either, 
  not just that though . 
  add some kind of humiliating punishment . 
  for you , maybe . 
  meanwhile in the richer countries the working class and basically everyone with little recognised education - including refugees and other immigrants - is screwed, 
  in many ways it encourages a race to the bottom though since goods produced in latvia at low wages can be sold in denmark far more easily . 
  i prefer to look at it in the way of `` is this something we * need * eu to do for us ? '' . 
  the eu does n't need to make food standards to improve the quality of foods - national governments can do that just fine . 
  what national governments ca n't do is make sure they 're the same for the entire eu block , which allows trade and competition . 
  which sounds sensible . 
  competition is n't * always * preferable , however . 
  sometimes you may prefer protectionism with for example matters of cultural preference ( like treatment of livestock ) , organisations of cultural significance ( like an orchestra ) , things that are helpful in the general happiness of the population ( like football ) , matters of national pride ( like a national airline ) or things that are considered vital to society such as food production , social housing , healthcare or utilities . 
  there 's no `` right '' or `` wrong '' for that , it 's politics . 
  if you 're in the eu however , you may find that the choice is made for you in brussels rather than on a national level . 
  brownian motion ? 
  after all , what is a bit of torture among friends ? 
  honestly the remain camp could make their campaign very easy : a vote for leave is a vote of confidence in cameron , as it 'd be the conservative party that would have to deal with post-brexit policy, 
  what the economist fails to understand is that there is more to life than economics, 
  true `` free trade '' does n't leave much room for political ideals . 
  anything that is subsidized , is in the hands of the government or has special rules could be considered to suffer ` unfair competition ' : utility companies , public transport , social housing , national industries , farming , fisheries , social security etc. 
  because of this , more and more political issues are being determined by eu legislation leaving less and less power to shape society for national governments . 
  not everyone is happy about the direction that is taking us . 
  you say give up everything ... 
  i 'd say you 'd pay 8 % more on italian shoes and 4,7 % on lego . 
  your exports might suffer a bit because the regulations will start to differ from the internal market . 
  i 'm sure that 's survivable, 
  a few % import tax will hardly wreck the uk ( or the eu ) economy though and it 'll allow the uk to apply its own rules for domestic trade . 
  no doubt it 'll reduce trade a bit in the long run but i do n't see why that would be such a disaster unless the politicians * want * to fuck things up, 
  no one seems to realize this but since i 've been born nobody dared invade the netherlands . 
  i feel i deserve some gratitude for that fact . 
  the ep/ec with the exception of a member that gets its voting rights suspended because it did n't honour certain agreements . 
  it would n't happen to germany or france but it might to greece , hungary or some of the smaller countries . 
  service guarantees citizenship !, 
  assuming you 're in the stay camp ... do try to persuade the doubters & people that believe the choice is not up to them to vote . 
  if they believe the choice is up to the government , it 's best for them to vote whatever the government advises rather than stay at home which would help the protest vote . 
  a lot of people in the dutch referendum did n't vote because they were against the idea of a referendum but not voting has consequences as well, 
  as if we were given the option to block the entry of countries like latvia , romania and hungary ... 
  no she was n't, 
  meanwhile the guy - who was arrested as well - claimed it was prostitution which is a serious crime in qatar . 
  i realize that 's not very credible if she went to the police herself and it 's ridiculous to hold her this long if there 's no evidence of that but we 've only heard from her lawyer so far, 
  no charges have yet been made , it 's not clear whether qatar would pursue the rape charge or whether they would charge her with anything . 
  it 's not clear whether her nationality offers her protection in case they did . 
  neither has her story been verified . 
  she 's in a very scary situation no matter what happened . 
  all in all it 's a bit early to paint qatar as evil morons, 
  this thread is the very definition of prejudice, 
  ~ ~ i do n't get this . 
  on the map italy and austria are net receivers whereas in the table they 're net contributors . 
  negative population ? ~ ~ edit : i should get some sleep . 
  is it though ? 
  all you know is that they gobble up data , got caught with hacking belgacom and the like and that they swallow up a huge amount of tax money . 
  that 's hardly an edorsement . 
  does gchq provide reliable , accurate critical information to the right people ? 
  as far as i know , there 's no reason to assume that is the case, 
  how hard can it be to track 50 million in payments ? 
  it 's something we have in flat countries, 
  what 's a european army * for * , invading greece ? 
  maybe we could send them to syria , and vote each year on which side they 're supposed to fight for . 
  i 'd like a return of nokia phones but is there anything linking these to the ` old ' nokia other than the ceo and brand name ( engineering/design/production ) ? 
  how else are they going to serve you with proper travel ads ? 
  correction : the uk 's fundamental position on europe for the last [ 500 years ] ( https://vimeo.com/85914510 ) . 
  ( i must have watched every episode more than 10x ), 
  a toddler could see the ministers did n't believe their own speeches . 
  truth was ( and is ) not an option for some reason even though every form of media ridiculed the eu and member states ' policy . 
  remember those graphs of imf predictions ? 
  did n't matter , we 're still kicking the can . 
  note to non-dutch people : our mayors are not elected , their positions are handed out in a rather dubious way to friends of ruling political parties . 
  that said , aboutaleb does appear to be quite popular, 
  wo n't that suggest they 'll fake actually going to the polar region though ? 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ fine ^ ^ with ^ ^ the ^ ^ name , ^ ^ although ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ not ^ ^ fond ^ ^ of ^ ^ the ^ ^ `` sir '', 
  they did n't mess about with austrexit, 
  people were n't as tall as nowadays, 
  remember when organisations like the kgb and stasi were considered bad guys ? 
  more likely , by people using terrorism as an excuse to increase their power . 
  i find it hard to believe people are * really * afraid of isis and their ilk , although it probably has created a lot of mistrust towards muslims, 
  erdogan is amusing , in a `` what the hell is wrong with you '' kind of way, 
  well , that and the way too rapid expansion of the eu + a fair bit of xenophobia + if that were overcome , turkey 's voting strength would be another stumbling block, 
  are we reading a different guardian or did they change the article ? 
  it depens a bit on whose side you 're on, 
   moved a step towards ending the european central bank 's ultra loose monetary policy just stop printing our money already, 
  apparently ` biggest ' is used more than ` smallest ' , almost as much as ` worst ' . 
  obviously it should be something like ` the largest difference in ratio between the area of the widest and that of the smallest opening of any section parallel to the bottom of a bottle . ', 
  yes but [ swedish roads ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abgdzb9rlr8&amp;t=1m0s ) have their own [ specific hazards ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abgdzb9rlr8&amp;t=9m10s ), 
  oddly enough there 's a very nice [ czech ship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_grace#/media/file:grace_with_full_sails.jpg ) that really deserves to be posted in / r/europe at the moment . 
  makes me want to replay ac4, 
  electrical cars pollute too dontchaknow . 
  although i admit i 'm a bit surprised at the wikipedia entry about `` clean coal '' , i assume modern coal plants are still a lot better than say , a coal plant from the 70s, 
  looking at numbers of frigate/submarine and larger the russians , the french ... maybe the greeks and italians too . 
  in the political climate at the time he was terrifying ( it is assumed demonisation by the media played a large role in that image ) . 
  to many it really did seem like we suddenly had a mini-hitler come out of nowhere . 
  i expect they would say the uk is different from other countries , especially those that have already adopted the euro ( and they 'd be right ) . 
  we would be utterly destroyed if we tried it before getting the ok from germany,
