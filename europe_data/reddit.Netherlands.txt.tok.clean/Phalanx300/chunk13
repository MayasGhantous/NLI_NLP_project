  seems to be the standard argument for sending refugees to our countries . 
  norway apparantly thinks otherwise . 
  still no proof for that judging from the links posted . 
  actually a link saying how many of them are returning on vacation , so dangerous . 
  seems fair enough , not our responsibility honestly . 
  that is like saying alexander was not a greek . 
  just saying he 's not fully wrong . 
  secret plot to get alsace ? 
  not sure why you 're being downvoted . 
  franks mainly settled in the low countries . 
  dutch are for the largest part a frankish people and charlemagne did originate in this area . 
  and this is why eu as a political union is bad . 
  probably warning that austrian prince which got assassinated in serbia . 
  preventing two world wars while also preventing communism and nazism . 
  hopefully . 
  15 million people expelled and 2 million raped !, 
  nope , it was soviet union expanding its border . 
  indeed . 
  good thing , ethnic cleansing of germans after wwii is often forgotten . 
  so much regional culture and history just wiped out like that . 
  well it just happens a major city was build on a gas reserve , meaning earthquakes . 
  so that probably is n't going to work out . 
  they will be revived though  . 
  not sure what norway is thinking . 
  here in the netherlands we also have some guys fighting alongside the kurds and they are fighting enemies of our state so they wont be trialed . 
  so you do n't want to avoid a war , while not having the means to fight back ? 
  best way to avoid war is a strong army . 
  maybe some name to reference siberia , like the mammoth or something . 
  mmm . 
  indeed , however most of greece seems to be under control of venice . 
  dem hanseatic cities . 
  [ jew cookies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jodenkoek ) . 
  though i gues its not that inaccurate as it originated from a jewish bakery . 
  ofcourse the exported version are not called that way but rather `` dutch cookies '' . 
  just wonder how viable it would be to just invest the maximum loan in stuff , if you do n't need it . 
  cooperation is fine , nothing more . 
  thats not a long term solution . 
  ca n't bring the whole world here , unless you want to stop being a rich region . 
  we did n't get to be a rich region by helping others , as cruel as it sounds . 
  its not just this instance . 
  its a constant surplus of thousands of low schooled refugees with low potential for the future . 
  add to that the added wellfare costs while there is already a lot of unemployment . 
  no point shooting yourself in the foot . 
  time to start taking care of people in their own region , which benefits us more . 
  nope , they are trying to get to the wealty european countries for a better live . 
  remember that news post `` italy has active volcanoes so i fear for my life '' . 
  it will , if you think long term . 
  are these guys advocating the killing of immigrants too ? 
  oh well , its a good plan really something has to be done . 
  time to regain some control over the illegal immigration . 
  80 years war against the spanish . 
  essentially formed the country we have today . 
  that greek one is the best , really great concept and the icon itself is also quite nice . 
  yet calling all people who came to the protests to voice their concerns extremists is just plain bigotry . 
  just pointing out your bigotry . 
  and all muslims are terrorists right ? 
  such bigotry . 
  so a few people are connected to neo-nazism , not sure how that makes most of them that way . 
  that is just bigotry , putting away people with some righteous concerns . 
  and why is that rightly , when most people seem to be concerned citizens ? 
  again , look at frisia which is even more different then the flemish arguably . 
  no problems . 
  as i said that is a choice to be made . 
  i myself prefer the true historical meaning and i refuse to let nazis essentially decide such important matters . 
  these days , not anymore . 
  provinces do n't have power anymore . 
  netherlands is a collection of netherlands , flanders is just another province like holland/utrecht/brabant / friesland etc. 
  leadership of the provinces is in the past . 
  i doubt flemish identity will disappear , just look at frisia . 
  was n't there talk of germany buying eastern prussia from russia many years back ? 
  would be interesting turn of events . 
  fellow eu4 fan !, 
  also , why groot-vlaanderen as opposed to groot-nederland ? 
  the flag was used for [ hundreds ] ( http://www.rvrijnland.nl/uploaded_files/editor/image/watergeuzen.jpg ) of years . 
  if hitler liked to eat hamburgers why should n't i be able to eat a hamburger ? 
  why still empower the dead people to control our lives ? 
  also , i meant it in the way that the current flag represents holland too much , and the yellow-black represents flanders too much . 
  prinsenvlag stood for the revolt and was waved in cities like antwerp before the spanish retook it . 
  did you forget the dutch sailed up the thames and destroyed the english navy ? 
  or when they invaded england to put a dutch king on the throne ? 
  size is n't everything . 
  just time to finally take care of those pesky duinkerken pirates . 
  though i suppose only the dutch speaking parts would be considered plausible : [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/france_flanders_language-en.svg/504px-france_flanders_language-en.svg.png ) . 
  [ prussia was at one point quite big ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/map-dr-prussia.svg ), 
  what ? 
  no the flemish people were once part of the french crown , that does not mean they are or were french in culture . 
  france just happens to occupy part of it . 
  i 'd also like france to return french flanders to a new plausible united netherlands . 
  you can have wallonia . 
  i 'd say uniting all dutch netherlands might be more viable and even preferable . 
  imagine the netherlands and flanders united it would become an economic powerhouse in the eu . 
  germany still has a core in eastern prussia . 
  probably hard to press that casus belli though . 
  no south-tyrol ? 
  just stettin would do . 
  just bothers me how soviets took the rivers as as the new border except for that part . 
  if you 're going to expell 15 million people at least make it look right . 
  [ greater-netherlands ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/grootnederlandineuropa.png ) , uniting flanders again with the motherland . 
  with the neutral [ prinsenvlag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/prinsenvlag.svg/220px-prinsenvlag.svg.png ) while we are at it , current red-white-blue is a result of using the colors of holland . 
  so basicly they can now use this sign as a waypoint ?
