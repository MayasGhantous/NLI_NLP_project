  sounds kind of fake . 
  but seriously this is insane , a french court no less . 
  and as someone pointed out the rapper went even more extreme then mentioned , focussing on french of gallic descent in his words . 
  karel de grote , he was born in brabant ( ? ), 
  i believe . 
  can still play as l\u00fcbeck though , but you will be weak . 
  sounds like fun !, 
  i 'll try to make it . 
  unsure who to play as , most smaller countries will probably mean suicide . 
  maybe hesse or genoa or something . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri ) , that should be usefull . 
  funny story seeing your username & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; . 
  are n't eurocritical parties actually banned from ever gaining power in portugal ? 
  remember reading something like that . 
  just the base euiv . 
  in multiplayer you get to use all the dlc of the host , unless you also want to play solo then you should get other dlc . 
  tsar and kaiser made room for communists and nazi 's . 
  makes you wonder if the monarchy was really all that bad back then . 
  you could see it as a twisted form of racism . 
  so no sharia police ? 
  see it is n't that hard . 
  `` troublemaker '', 
  now you can start marganilising other problems !, 
  really you ca n't blame people for first pointing to the biggest threat from their perspective . 
  not sure they have to , considering many language problems and them going back when things finally settle down . 
  with all the false passports being made we would need more proof of said education . 
  an interesting read and this will definately become the inevitable future seeing how more and more jobs will be lost due to technological advancements and machines making things more efficient . 
  really curious if it will work out for the finns . 
  personally i would like flanders to gain independence because that would be a first step towards further dutch-flemish cooperation in a possible federalised state . 
  as for others i fully support any large movement seeking independence . 
  would be nice seeing venice on the map again seeing how they were independent for over a 1000 years . 
  for comparison what happened after wwii would be the same as ethnically cleansing the netherlands of everyone . 
  population wise . 
  was a big war crime which is often forgotten . 
  [ napoleon disagreed . 
  ] ( http://orig08.deviantart.net/0392/f/2014/363/f/d/kingdom_of_holland_by_nintenpug-d8bp3t0.png ), 
  world war 0, 
  worked at a company with a few germans once , there was a bavarian flag on the wall and not a german one . 
  definately interesting how people are feeling about it . 
  you mean soviet style ? 
  already forgot about prussia ? 
  and black pete as well . 
  counts of holland took a part of frisia in the middle ages , currently part of north-holland . 
  tldr : europe can into hre . 
  it was n't triggered by her yet it most definately was boosted by her words . 
  have to disagree , krampus has a whole other atmosphere of scaring children rather than giving them candy and being a figure of inspiration for children . 
  its roots actually go back to pagan rituals . 
  painting yourself black is still alive in other european countries , take krampus in austria for example . 
  completely goes against the history of the tradition which can be seen troughout europe . 
  gues what all comes back , black color . 
  its probably why the transition from black demon to black moor was made . 
  from a negative to a positive thing . 
  quota 's do n't work , we do n't get to decide the terms when such huge groups of people are moving about without restrictions . 
  yet all concentrated and not spread out , hence such percentages are completely useless in shaping such an image . 
  he has a new evil dead series , should check it out . 
  they did n't like the food . 
  if it are skillfull workers benefitting society with an efficient immigration policy , sure . 
  not in this scenario however . 
  what are polish doing in bavaria 's classrooms ? 
  they have also been targetting opponents ( rebels ) of assad which are supported by other countries . 
  fun fact being that the russian colors are based on the dutch flag . 
  the red version actually predates the orange one . 
  but i agree the orange one is far [ better ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/hendrick_cornelis_vroom_het_uitzeilen_van_een_aantal_oost-indi%c3%abvaarders_%281600%29.jpg ) looking . 
  for those wondering . 
  both `` the netherlands '' and `` belgium '' are both used to describe the same region of the low countries . 
  modern divide did n't exist at that time . 
  then you were mistaken . 
  try again in a thousand years . 
  everyone is pushing his own agenda after the tragedy . 
  that is politics for you . 
  i 'm all for strict immigration policies . 
  ofcourse the other large sitting members in parliament will not allow such a vote to happen which will only serve to fuel disagreement with the current policies . 
  think of measures such as spending money for local caretaking of the real refugees , not for economic migrants looking for a wellfare state to profit from . 
  there are multiple ways to take care of refugees without breaking any international laws . 
  not even counting the huge number of people who are n't from syria ( 80 % ) . 
  and what makes you think strict immigration policies is reserved for the far right ? 
  harmfull comment on your part . 
  and then they say people in the north are cocky , at least we do n't pretend to just be holland !, 
  like the flemish bitch counterparts in the south ? 
  only 1/2 of regional flanders is actually flanders . 
  have to agree . 
  maybe it is time to call it quits and split up , flanders is looking pretty attractive . 
  the netherlands is n't just about holland . 
  noord-brabant and limburg can be considered similar to the regions accros the borders actually . 
  maybe you should go there with your hatefull rants . 
  because usually those populations are living very focussed making it appear more . 
  there should n't . 
  however if you try to put policies in place to try and change that you will be branded a racist because it is essentially a racially based policy . 
  the inaccurate clothing annoys me more than it should . 
  we will flood their lands !, 
  banning people who claim such things and try to take a progressive approach is just a part of the problem really . 
  when an imam for example is calling upon religious people to kill infidels i think we have a reason to punish him . 
  if he were to deny say the armenian genocide or deny any other confirmed happenings i do n't see that as a reason to punish . 
  what would you propose ? 
  probably [ michiel de ruyter ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/bol%2c_michiel_de_ruyter.jpg/800px-bol%2c_michiel_de_ruyter.jpg ) , admiral of the dutch republic . 
  born as a commoner he managed to work his way up the ranks . 
  without his efforts the country would most likely have ceased to exist . 
  his biggest succes is sailing up the thames in the second anglo-dutch war and destroying a large part of the navy and capturing the most prized english ship . 
  he also took on both the combined english and french fleets in the third anglo-dutch war and won .
