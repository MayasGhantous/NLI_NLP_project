  hating us so much you bought tanks from us ? 
  coat of arms of my hometown [ amersfoort ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/amersfoort_wapen.svg/2000px-amersfoort_wapen.svg.png ) . 
  the symbol should look familiar to the english here , being the cross of saint george . 
  first use of the symbol in amersfoort dates to 1233 . 
  i really love how they translated the cross into the [ current flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/amersfoort_flag_outline.svg/450px-amersfoort_flag_outline.svg.png ) . 
  i like that orange you guys have going on , we could use more of that in our flag . 
  netherlands can also into [ march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejrkwjj2vmc ) ? 
  [ flag of venice ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/art/countries/venicerepublic.gif ) . 
  for some reason this version , which is actually used most in the actual city , is hard to find digitally . 
  most digital versions refer to one with a white lion . 
  the venetian history and their succes as a republic , which for some reason is largely unknown , really adds to the flag . 
  also the local independence movement makes this one imporant . 
  [ prinsenvlag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/prinsenvlag.svg/220px-prinsenvlag.svg.png ) . 
  an historical dutch flag . 
  i prefer it above our current flag because it has more identity to it . 
  it also is a revolutionairy flag and does not represent any provinces in particular , the current flag used to be called `` flag of holland '' . 
  this also goes along well with my desire to unite the netherlands and flanders , as either the current dutch flag or the flemish flag would make the country flag too one sided . 
  the prinsenvlag was also flown in flanders during the dutch revolt , whichadds legitimay to this suggestion . 
  [ flag of prussia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/6/6a/20070722232351!flag_of_prussia_1903-1918.svg ) . 
  was an important state in the history of europe and was brutally destroyed after wwii . 
  the use of black and white and the eagle definately make it look unique and powerfull . 
  the tragic history also adds value to the flag . 
  ridiculous is all that can be said about this . 
  clusters should be something negative right ? 
  as it essentially shows failed integration . 
  personally i think they knew fully the realities of the situation . 
  however they needed public support to start these measures , after all it would 've been political suicide for many of those leaders to propose these measures in the beginning . 
  a bit too late , why does it take so long to recognize a serious problem and act accordingly ? 
  caring for refugees in nearby countries has been suggested from the beginning . . 
  entered this with that country in mind , who says games ca n't be educational ?!, 
  why no germanic culture group though ? 
  worry about wallonia first , you can always rebel again after we split up your country !, 
  dutch 1 , sea 0 . 
  makes me wonder whether splitting up germany in its seperate states would have been a more humane solution to the afterwar crimes . 
  the european union has overstepped its role and needs to hand back decision making to its member countries . 
  untill then i will keep voting against the european union . 
  it should be about cooperation , not about controlling all member states through centralisation . 
  pure madness . 
  if i were such an owner i would house temporal students in there or something . 
  really germany ? 
  good trolling attempt sir . 
  one crime does n't excuse another crime . 
  really , you have trouble understanding this ? 
  the fact that it actually manages to make you furious just shows how you actually think it is justified . 
  your research consists of reading that bad stuff happened , with you trying to use it in an attempt to justify other bad stuff . 
  well done . 
  what you think to be the truth may not always be the truth . 
  might be a mind-blowing thought . 
  you are making the mistake of seeing those famillies as identical to the true hardcore nazi party members . 
  i hope people have mercy on your familly when you commit crimes . 
  because you are trying to use it to justify it , you keep repeating the same bullshit as well . 
  crime does n't excuse crime , no exceptions . 
  crime does n't excuse crime . 
  you should be ashamed . 
  no you should study . 
  there is no excuse to expell 15 million people from their land . 
  we are talking famillies here , not ss soldiers . 
  slavery was ok during that timeframe , yet that does n't mean we should justify it today . 
  again , that is no justification . 
  yes the netherlands also expelled some germans , how does that somehow justify it ? 
  it ca n't be justified simply because in this case they are germans as opposed to another ethnicity . 
  you are talking about famillies being forced to move away purely because of their ethnicity . 
  there is no justification for that . 
  crimes do n't justify crimes . 
  so they will be known as the `` native martians '' ? 
  no , it was changed because they are potential targets when wearing those uniforms . 
  its insane . 
  flanders , venice and bavaria perhaps . 
  i would n't even mind . 
  the smart thing to do , well played japan . 
  too late to do that now though . 
  ehh , are n't the mongols the guys beating you ? 
  yet only one mod can sit on the iron throne . 
  not really as it would allow us to unite split provinces . 
  maybe it will even cause that continental crisis we 've been waitin for , or perhaps even ww3 . 
  and what if following a brexit it will experience economical growth ? 
  if anything it will cause more exits . 
  it is severly outdated and it needs many reforms to bring it up to date . 
  yet i have zero trust in that being achievable with the current union . 
  hence i would fully support a nexit , even if it may initially be worse financially which would remain to be seen . 
  a great question asked by daniel hannan during the oxford union debate gave some food for thought . 
  basicly being : `` would you want your country to join the current union if it were not already a part of it ? '' . 
  give that question some thought . 
  according to the latest poll , conducted by 27.000 people , if the netherlands had such a referendum we would vote to [ leave ] ( http://opiniepanel.eenvandaag.nl/uitslagen/67763/meerderheid_voor_referendum_over_eu_lidmaatschap ) . 
  with 48 % voting to leave and 45 % voting to stay . 
  and according to the poll a majority of the population is in favor of holding such a referendum ( 54 % ) . 
  maybe daniel hannan would be up for it , he is quite active on twitter . 
  why just remain ? 
  any comments criticising the eu are downvoted here regardless , it will just be one huge circlejerk . 
  i 'm not sure that will end well for the women sadly . 
  if only it was . 
  those governments are subservient to the union , not actually ruling it . 
  with such major issues , yes absolutely . 
  if you have any kind of respect for your citizens and democracy you will do that . 
  things like this are why hate against the eu is growing . 
  those are [ dangerous ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/powerlisting/images/2/2d/v_for_vendetta_by_rub_a_duckie.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131005020503 ) thoughts . 
  is n't there a islamic word for that ? 
  kind of dangerous when there is such a strong ideology behind the religion . 
  they are forcing their way into germany in an illegal manner . 
  denying that is objectively false and obvious agenda pushing .
