  accusations need proof , which you are lacking . 
   * he was talking about culture , but you have to read his book to understand it . 
  you do n't need to read his book to understand it , it just further serves to add context . 
  the latter of which you are willfully ignoring . 
   * he was talking about nationalism . 
  he was not talking about race . 
  nationalism is n't about race . 
  read up on it if you do n't believe that . 
  ofcourse i deny it because you have not provided any proof . 
  he has explained his comment and there is no proof to support your false claims . 
  you are obviously lying at this point trying to falsely discredit thierry baudet and his new rising party which is leaving a bad taste in my mouth . 
  my reply was also a response to your entire comment , not just your question . 
  leading to a misinterpretation on your side . 
  now lets take a look at your argument : * he is lying , and so are you !, 
  which is severly lacking in proof and content . 
  also nationalism is n't necesarilly about race , not sure where you get that idea . 
  from what i 've read it is impossible to tell beforehand whether such a whale is pregnant . 
  he did not attempt it , he did it . 
  he has been giving daily speeches for a long time now and now he is being attacked on one sentence seen without context . 
  how about you search for the actual audio piece instead of just watching the pauw & jinek clip . 
  i 've been watching many of his speeches and he has not been giving any indication or red flag to me that he is secretly some kind of neo-nazi . 
  it is at least not indicated by his political views and stances . 
  he was talking about culture which can be understood when you also take into account his book `` attack on the nation state '' , which is essentially talking about an attack on the nation state and essentially nationalism as well through mass-migration . 
  he was not talking about race . 
  we are calling out your attempts of demonisation and slander without proof . 
  it does and it does n't make him a neo-nazi . 
  nice attempt at trolling though . 
  he has clarified he was talking about culture , which if you extend the scene is something he was refering to . 
  poorly chosen words but nothing to do with race . 
  they will get a few seats and will probably continue to grow , they are in it for the long term and will also participate in other elections . 
  they will have my vote at least , and i used to vote pvv , its nice to have a realistic alternative . 
  he is not , what an outrageous attempt at demonisation . 
  surely you have the proof to back up those false claims ? 
  lets have a referendum about it , seems fair . 
  aboutaleb is a prime example of succesfull integration into society . 
  still remember him catching a thief with his bare hands on the streets and defending western values on al jazeera channel . 
  because a basic income is supposed to be given to everyone , not just those below a certain level of living . 
  as now we have a gap where those who work minimum-wage might have as much income as someone in wellfare which damages the incentive to work . 
  the way i roughly see it : * vvd - liberal * pvda - labour * pvv - conservative * sp - socialist * cda - liberal-christian * d66 - progressive-liberal * cu - progressive-christian * gl - green * sgp - conservative-christian * pvdd - animals * 50 + - elderly * vnl - liberal-conservative ( new ) * denk - migrant ( new ) * fvd - progressive-conservative ( new ), 
  personally i prefer the [ english bull terrier ] ( https://www.houdenvanhonden.nl/globalassets/rassen/fci-3/bull-terrier/groovygirl-of-velvet-spine--topfuel-devils-paintbrush-0003.jpg ) though i believe in behavior they are pretty much as clownish as the staffordshire . 
  great with families and children but less so with other dogs . 
  especially interesting are the galatians and their position in anatolia though migration . 
  i would n't put it past the vvd to cooperate with him . 
  actually i still visit it and most people seem to turn towards forum voor democratie for a more realistic approach . 
  they opposed it because she has a dual nationality and could have a conflict of interests because of it . 
  bit of a non-argument . 
  people who want free wellfare in social countries can already do little to nothing and get `` free money '' . 
  those people who would abuse a basic income by doing nothing can already do nothing today . 
  same here , a nice alternative voice . 
  their wish to implement a swiss inspired direct democracy really sounds quite good . 
  or time to derail it ? 
  alternatively we can just close off the schelde , checkmate ? 
  ca n't see it happening , perhaps a union between the netherlands and flanders once belgium falls apart . 
  they should change our flag to it as well , not just for pun though . 
  our secret biological warfare plan to end the rebellion has been discovered !, 
  good luck landing an army on my island , i 'll be sure to keep a strong force present while my ships raid the muslim lands !, 
  the knights stand with the holy father . 
  we must raise the blade to the turk and stop their approach into christian lands !, 
  the knights will raid you as well , those ducats and sailors belong to christianity !, 
  the [ staatsjacht utrecht ] ( http://images0.tcdn.nl/incoming/article22787000.ece/binary/q/statenjacht+onder+vol+tuig.jpg ) is also a nice ship . 
  the flag is posted at / r/vexillology all the time !, 
  disgusting , so we should let him be killed because he has a different opinion ? 
  that already happened with pim fortuyn . 
  what kind of country would we be if controversial politicians keep getting killed ? 
  gib [ ost-friesland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/map_kingdom_of_holland_1807-nl.svg/800px-map_kingdom_of_holland_1807-nl.svg.png ) . 
  indeed , let us hope the pope is sensible and allows us to retake the holy lands !, 
  in the meantime my ships shall raid the turks !, 
  i 'd like to reserve the knights if possible . 
  it likely has to do something with [ this ] ( http://www.andrzejb.net/slavic/images/map2.jpg ) . 
  not really because there was a post-war population burst . 
  so ofcourse population is evening out , the post-war development is n't the baseline we should be following . 
  he was demonised for quite a bit for his views . 
  in fact this is what he said just days before he was killed , crudely translated by me : `` if you see what i get in my mailbox sometimes , threats , you do n't get happy . 
  and the dutch government , which i find a bloody shame , is helping to create a environment of demonisation of myself . 
  and if something were to happen to me , and i 'm happy that you are giving me the oppertunity , if something were to happen to me then they share responsibility . 
  and they ca n't claim to not be responsible in the sense of `` i did n't commit that attack '' . 
  you helped to create the environment which made it possible and that has to stop ! '', 
  and having direct democracy helps us to boost political engagement and the trust in our political system . 
  it might not be painless initially but i feel it is a mature way of practicing democracy in this century . 
  same for me , though the choice between vnl and fvd is prooving to be a rather hard choice . 
  though i 'm edging towards fvd at the moment . 
  according to a survey of eenvandaag it is because of three things : * trump scares people . 
  * people do n't want to have a wasted vote . 
  parties have said to exclude the pvv in cabinet formation . 
  * people do n't think wilders is serious enough . 
  there will be a referendum in the netherlands about it though . 
  that can only happen through consent by the citizens of each country , otherwise it really is not founded on any kind of foundation . 
  we 'll send in our mountaineers , the limburgers . 
  quite so , however if you look at the frisians it should pose no existential problem . 
  well i 've noticed an increased level of cooperation between flanders and the netherlands . 
  especially television shows using people from both regions really serves to strenghten the ties . 
  and it would appear flanders has some good comedians as well . 
  and our current flag is stained by slavery and genocide . 
  really want to make it a moral discussion ? 
  any source on that referendum ? 
  i know it was part of the kingdom of the netherlands when it was created by france but i 've heard nothing about a referendum . 
  [ it ] ( https://krikienoid.github.io/flagwaver/#?src=http%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fwyd2eyz.png ) looks quite nice as well . 
  considering it was used in both the netherlands and in flanders . 
  i 'd rather see brussels as a province like friesland . 
  it will be a part of our country but it would have the local language ( french . . ) as a protected language within the province .
