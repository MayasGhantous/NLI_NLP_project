  if its illegal and parents do it anyways they should have the children removed . 
  it would be better if he were to go about like [ this ] ( https://s.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/glob/crop/2100x1112+0+33/resize/660x350!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/294248341a4f79dc4f2b650e05c4bee/203529630/1_intro.jpg ) . 
  at first i was confused , wondering where the brown/black person was untill i realised this was just a cheap godwin by the screaming man . 
  welcome to politics . 
  erdogan approves . 
  it balances out the left-wing prominence which you often find on reddit . 
  they are n't in a position to decline i 'd imagine . 
  where did you get the data on ethnic composition ? 
  should n't there be a significant german population as well in 1618 in the region portrayed ? 
  rule does n't always apply though , the flag of amersfoort for example is a modern one yet it does n't look like a flag of a multinational company . 
  ecb is going to buy his debt . 
  always interesting to see how venice was independent for so long , many people do n't realise it is one of the oldest and longest constantly existing republics . 
  also interesting that there is an independence movement for venice today to seperate it from the rest of italy . 
  i figure population density is also related to it , as you need less officers to cover the same ground in a very densely populated country . 
  but what if people with actual guns do that in order to delay the cops from showing up ? 
  you can freely comment however no one else will see your comments . 
  it is an extremely malicious tool in my eyes , there are accounts on reddit of people who have been shadowbanned for months without realising it . 
  that is the point , they stopped simply removing posts and starting to close only fvd threads before any fighting has yet happened . 
  simply because it happened before . 
  now i 'm not saying they should n't have done that , but at least they should have given the same approach to any political discussion and not just those about the unpopular conservative party . 
  ofcourse i doubt reddit could influence elections but it was still election season and one party was not allowed to have its information freely posted which did not feel fair . 
  it were just news articles which were being posted , not memes or anything . 
  and that is frankly not true , perhaps a small minority which does such actions . 
  if you look at the election result thread [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/5zhq24/stemdag_megadraad_op_wie_heb_je_gestemd/ ) you can see it is a gl/d66 stronghold however suprisingly a lot of fvd voters as well . 
  and the reason mentioned by the mods was to prevent the fights which often happened in the threads which always started because some users felt the need to insult the fvd , baudet or its voters and others disagreeing . 
  the fvd threads were always littered with removed posts . 
  however simply removing all fvd threads beforehand felt like taking sides when news on other parties was freely allowed to remain . 
  i hope my country someday gets to adopt the mature democracy of switzerland , it is the perfect way to restore trust in politics while also returning more power in the hand of its citizens . 
  i 'm aware of that , i did some research when my karma was not fluctuating . 
  testing in incognito mode revealed that my new posts was in fact not visible for anyone but myself ( and the moderators ) . 
  it is an easilly abused feature for those in power and frankly i 'm not sure bypassing admins like that should be allowed . 
  mods can do something similar using automoderator . 
  more info [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/1l4n0t/using_automoderator_to_shadowban_users_from_your/ ) . 
  so yes , its not the same as an admin shadowban , but it has the same effect on the specific subreddit . 
  occasionally i take a look around / r/finanzen as well , it sometimes has some interesting economic discussions . 
  i was also temporarilly shadowbanned because many people downvoted and reported my comments , they mentioned it as `` flame-baiting '' . 
  ( they do so without telling you as well ! ), 
  it seems the `` tone '' of the debate is heavilly moderated which limits free speech somewhat . 
  and i 've noticed a harsh tone against conservative opinions is somewhat more tolerated than the reverse . 
  sadly it reminds me of how / r/europe used to be when it still had its old mods . 
  the worst thing i 've seen , besides the shadowban policy , is how they actively removed all fvd ( new conservative political party ) related submissions just before the elections . 
  while posts on other political parties were freely allowed to remain . 
  they did this to keep the peace but it left a bad taste in my mouth when considering the elections , it felt like they took sides in the matter . 
  can confirm . 
  first thought was how it looks like a german city , turns out its alsatian so i gues it is german . 
  seeing the high amounts of corruption and the power of the oligarchs this is extremely worrying . 
  this is n't any different to what erdogan is doing . 
  the french voted for the entire continent ? 
  ah , discrimination is fine if we disagree with someone it seems . 
  the circlejerk is real on this subreddit . 
  the association agreement is not just a trade agreement . 
  you do n't need a treaty to combat corruption . 
  frankly even the president has many offshore accounts to flush in some money as shown by arno wellens . 
  ca n't fix the most corrupt country of europe , nor is it our duty to do so . 
  it was not just about trade , it is essentially a prelude to make ukraine viable to join the eu in the future once it meets demands . 
  a normal trade agreement is barely the size of the ukraine one . 
  just look at the tweets of porosjenko , eu membership is the end-goal . 
  i 'd argue it is not in the interest of the netherlands to have ukraine join . 
  no need for insults because you do n't agree with me , ukrainians not being allowed free travel to our country was one of the things said to never happened and we should n't have to worry about it . 
  and yet here it happened , just another lie . 
  the largest component of the `` against '' voters have voted that way because of the corruption in ukraine . 
  quite sad really , but fully expected . 
  further serves to fuel the desire for a nexit . 
  it is not trolling , you are imagining comments i make and reacting to that . 
  i do n't see the problem with such sites , they do n't shy away from political incorrectness . 
  just take the geenstijl controversy and how mainstream news outlets ( nrc/volkskrant ) are reacting to it . 
  oh , another strawman . 
  good job , how do you even get those links ? 
  and why do you think the tpo or geenstijl are news sites ? 
  i see it as a news/entertainment/controversy mix but definately not as a main source of news . 
  if i were to go for news i 'd stick with telegraaf/elsevier . 
  then i suppose you should n't be discussing based on implications . 
  a tasty cake in which no political correctness can be found , though after they tried to start of political party it has gone a bit downhill . 
  i 'd argue a site like tpo has better quality currently . 
  where did i say you ca n't celebrate that ? 
  i was just wondering if you can also celebrate it without the oppressive union . 
  because you can love the continent and its countries and peoples without wanting a centralising political union . 
  so working together instead of living in the same house . 
  we are already the highest proportional payer . 
  and now with the uk leaving it could become worse . 
  time for less eu indeed . 
  the netherlands was a rich merchant dominated country before it had colonies though . 
  just look at [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/continental_west_germanic_languages.png ) dialects map and [ this ] ( http://68.media.tumblr.com/c7039f9b1025d0f43a50c787038f420f/tumblr_ms33m8wtse1qabi5zo1_1280.png ) light map when focussing on the benelux . 
  the gas represents about 1 % of our income . 
  how about celebrating europe without the eu ? 
  please stay away from politics , kurzgesagt was pretty nice before making too many political videos which is ruining the channel for those left out . 
  i have read them and find them quite trustworthy when combined with the other items such as the coins and the cloths ordered by the count of holland . 
  the sources used are stated at the bottom . 
  i also used to believe the version of the prinsenvlag being older but it seems to be incorrect . 
  with the red representing holland and the white and blue representing the von wittelsbach ( bavaria ) colors . 
  [ nope ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/statenvlag ) . 
  prinsenvlag was created during our revolt , the hollandsche/statenvlag predate it as a flag used by holland . 
  i like the term `` crowned republic '' . 
  european commission officials ? 
  and white and red are also the hanseatic colors right ? 
  the prinsenvlag does , the red hollandsche/statenvlag however has more republican influences . 
  and the hollandsche/statenvlag predates the prinsenvlag . 
  so she is a bad person for having the blood of a bad person ? 
  you do n't find that line of thought twisted ? 
  who will stop them ?
