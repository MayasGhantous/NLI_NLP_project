  the later monarchy was n't a puppet state ruled by a foreign power . 
  sure the monarchy was mainly installed by the british and prussians but it was an independent state and not occupied . 
  that kingdom is as legitimate as vichy france . 
  we did n't actually turn 200 yesterday it was just 200 years ago that the first king landed . 
  the kingdom was n't proclaimed until 1815 . 
  after the congress of vienna luxembourg was part of the ngc but under rule of the dutch monarch . 
  when germany was unified luxembourg was still under control of the netherlands . 
  if i had to guess why luxembourg was never annexed by germany i would imagine it was for this reason . 
  besides that though , modern luxembourg is a lot smaller than it used to be historically losing parts of it to france , germany ( for joining the ngc ) and belgium ( after belgium became independent from the netherlands ),

  the wikipedia page of the united kingdom said that brussel was co-capital with amsterdam but if i interpret [ this ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/geschiedenis_van_brussel#hoofdstad_der_nederlanden ) dutch page correctly then it was the capital of the southern part of the kingdom with amsterdam being the capital of the northern part . 
  the united kingdom of the netherlands had both amsterdam and brussels as the capital . 
  the burgundian netherlands were just lands owned by burgundy and not an independent state . 
  thing is the united kingdom of the netherlands had brussels and amsterdam as capitals . 
  it 's a matter of whether you consider the republic 's capital to be the original or the uk 's . 
  from what i remember we actually had both brussels and ~ ~ the hague ~ ~ amsterdam has capitals switching every year . 
  [ source edit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_of_the_netherlands ) seems like the united kingdom had brussels and amsterdam as capital .
