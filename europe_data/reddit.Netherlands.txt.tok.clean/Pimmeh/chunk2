  not just in europe but in the world . 
  it is but the double l is pronounced similarly to the dutch g sound . 
  except literally nothing interesting happened the past summer . 
  i see quite a lot of grandparents with their grandchildren walking around , although this can be a bit biased considering i go to school next to a zoo . 
  it was fun knowing you . 
  c1000 is clearly the superior choice . 
  time to revive the united kingdom of the netherlands . 
  packard bell is dutch but part of acer which is taiwanese . 
  besides that we also have asml holding which develops the technology for intel to improve it 's processors .

  has it been long enough to make a yugoslavia tribunal joke ? 
  it 's the only french thing i want in this country . 
  carrefour . 
  i live in zuid-holland . 
  i ai n't even mad . 
  ^ ^ ^ p.s. 
  ^ ^ ^ flair ^ ^ ^ up !, 
  they 're pretty much the same anyway . 
  the holy roman empire shall be reborn !, 
  he was buried under the snow for 50 minutes and then being in a coma for 18 months . 
  according to the internet it 's ge-e-maild . 
  how the fuck are you supposed to spell ge\u00ebmaild ? 
  what are tanks ? 
  play svi\u00fejob in the `` the old gods '' start .

  ** the netherlands ** * the wolf that was found might have been put there as a joke but might not have been . 
  * the spider crab that died was already ill before it came here . 
  * some people found a british ww2 bomb during digging activities and it was detonated a few days later . 
  [ video with explosion at 0:50 ] ( http://nos.nl/video/529141-vliegtuigbom-met-succes-ontmanteld.html ) * police was searching prostitution boats with suspicions of human trafficking . 
  * measles epidemic . 
  children who were n't vaccinated are getting ill . last time this happened 10.000 + children were infected and 3 died . 
  i think so . 
  ** the netherlands ** * first traffic jam caused by the nice weather . 
  * a spider crab in seaworld died after being there for 2 days .

  the erasmusbrug in rotterdam is how it should be done everywhere in my opinion . 
  sidewalks on the outside , bicycle lanes next , then the car and in the middle the tram . 
  so long as the bicycle lane does n't cross a car lane . 
  the european continent is defined based on a cultural/political divide rather than a geographical, 
  the netherlands, 
  i find it interesting that the word for cucumber east of the netherlands is some variation of ( a ) gurk , because the dutch world for pickle is augurk . 
  it 's almost a straight line south from istanbul to rhodes . 
  but ikea is dutch d :, 
  it 's a gradual change into the new austerity measures . 
  450.000 dutch people agreed that there should be a referendum on the association agreement not a referendum on the eu 's expansionism and loss of democracy . 
  it 's the price you pay to not be one . 
  it 's in dutch which not everyone on this subreddit knows . 
  diets and duits are from the same language but different dialects . 
  at the time of the dutch revolt there was no such thing as a dutch language , only one of the many german dialects spoken in europe . 
  it was an accident and they thought it was a ukrainian military transport plane . 
  the bbc 's headline does sound sensationalist if you consider `` russian '' to be `` made in russia '' rather than `` owned by russia '' . 
  if it 's the latter it contradicts fred westerbeke 's statement but if it 's the former it is n't wrong . 
  in response to 2 ) - there is no concrete evidence that it was a russian buk . 
  as much as you might want to believe with the points you listed , the investigation does not rely on assumptions only on facts . 
  i 'd say another 2-3 luxembourgs . 
  i used the benelux because that 's what i know and then added denmark because they fit the gap . 
  according to wikipedia russia 's gdp in 2014 was one luxembourg larger than the entire benelux + denmark . 
  assuming that their gdps stay the same and russia 's has fallen by the 4.6 % they 're now equal to the benelux + denmark minus half a luxembourg . 
  and those 14 meter are on a bridge . 
  the highest natural point is only 8 meter high . 
  from what i remember the owner of the van said he brought it to the scrapyard but something happened there . 
  there was also a van from a metalworking company from the dutch city of leiden spotted in syria . 
  estonia is 10 % larger than the netherlands but has only 7.8 % of the people . 
  google listed him as being 185cm so i went by that . 
  rutte is 185 i believe . 
  spain 's richest person is 100x richer than croatia 's . 
  wow . 
  four !, 
  luxembourg must be repaid for the partition !, 
  here we go again . 
  in the linked fragment it sounds vaguely german but there are certain s and g sounds that do n't appear in regular german and more resemble what i know of hebrew . 
  it sounds as if somebody took german and started speaking it with a stereotypical hebrew/israeli accent in english . 
  to me yiddish just sounds * different * . 
  it does n't feel as if it 's a germanic language and a lot of the sounds they make feel off . 
  this is the calmest and most well-spoken i have ever seen him . 
  i believe there were actually two helicopters with one serving as a decoy . 
  reminds me of the nuclear security summit in the hague last year . 
  compare [ di rupo ] ( https://twitter.com/keesspruijt/status/448043603961843712/photo/1 ) and [ obama ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3jjqs1sbxe ) . 
  a man can dream ; _ ;, 
  there 's two limburgs and three brabants , we ca n't have that . 
  i read this headline as `` parliament of griekenland unanimously approves same-sex marriage '' several times and was surprised at how progressive greece was . 
  he recognised it kosovo is independent, 
  i 'd take them both !, 
  the appeal is that the eu is seen as weak because of certain progressive policies while putin is seen as a strong leader who can protect them from evil homosex . 
  yelling without giving a solution is n't politics . 
  i can watch more than double the amount of titles in the other constituent countries than in my own . 
  hope we repeal this law soon . 
  i 'll add it to the other post .
