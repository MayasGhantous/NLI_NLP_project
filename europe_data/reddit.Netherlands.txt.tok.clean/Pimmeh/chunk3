  but you have to consider the party 's stance . 
  the labour and liberal parties are both in favour of the agreement and ignoring the result could result in voters leaving for ignoring the referendum or because the voters are also in favour they will stay . 
  there are many arguments to be made on why to ignore the referendum but also many on why to accept the result . 
  voters switching parties is something that ca n't really be predicted especially because the `` real '' national campaigns for the upcoming elections have n't started . 
  you can vote in municipalities outside of your own if requested leading in a turnout rate above 100 % in some municipalities . 
  i did notice that as well but it seems that the nos has adjusted the turnout rate . 
  it 's now 33,4 % . 
  you can by voting for anti-eu parties during the general elections or forming your own . 
  the result is non-binding so the government can choose to disregard it . 
  based on the turnout rate a very valid argument can be made that the majority of eligible votes is still in favour of the agreement and considering that both government parties and several opposition parties are in favour of the agreement the agreement will most likely still be passed . 
  yes that is indeed the case . 
  i copy-paste my comment from yesterday ( which surprisingly is almost fully accurate ) :  let 's assume that we reach the 30 % turnout and that a supermajority ( 67 % because that is what you would need to change the constitution ) is against the agreement . 
  that would end up being 20 % of eligible voters being against the agreement . 
  however this would leave 80 % either in favour of the agreement/status quo , neutral , in disagreement with the referendum in itself or not knowing or caring enough about the referendum itself . 
   quick edit : only at a turnout of 75 % with a supermajority of 67 % will the no-voters be in the absolute majority . 
  for any turnout that is below 75 % you can make the argument that only a minority of people are actually opposed to the agreement and a turnout of 75 % simply is n't going to happen . 
  such a low turnout is going to start a discussion on how to handle this . 
  will the turnout requirement be removed ? 
  will the requirement be made higher/lower ? 
  a new dutch law allowed the public to organise a non-binding advisory referendum on certain topics if they collect signatures . 
  the first law able to be voted on was on the ratification of the eu-ukraine association agreement . 
  the required signatures were collected and today the referendum was held . 
  these treaties have to be approved by the european parliament and the council of ministers . 
  to get approval from the council of ministers you need either unanimity or 55 % of the countries with a combined 65 % of the population need to agree depending on the policy . 
  one of these policies according to wikipedia is :  certain policy fields remain subject to unanimity in whole or in part , such as :  membership of the union ( opening of accession negotiations , association , serious violations of the union 's values , etc. 
  ) ; i 'd assume that the trade agreement that brexit supporters want is part of this . 
  yes and there is a 3 % error margin when it comes to the turnout rate . 
  resubmission because i reversed the against and in favour percentages . 
  ### end results : 100 % votes counted , 32,2 % turnout , 38,1 % in favour , 61,1 % against , ### translation : ** exitpoll ipsos : large majority against agreement , validity unsure ** a majority of 64 % has voted against the association agreement with ukraine . 
  36 % is in favour . 
  reports research institute ipsos in a first exit poll requested by the nos . 
  it 's still unknown if the required turnout threshold of 30 % has been reached . 
  according to ipsos the turnout rate is 29 % . 
  however there is an error margin of 3 percentage point . 
  that means that after all votes have been counted the turnout rate will be between 3 % higher or 3 % lower when compared to the first exit poll . 
  when it comes to the result the error margin is 5 percentage point . 
  ** taking it seriously ** dutch voters had until 21:00 the time to vote in favour , against or blank/none of the above . 
  blank/none of the above votes matter when it comes to the turnout rate . 
  irregardless of the result the referendum is advisory . 
  that means that the cabinet does not have to conform to the result . 
  yesterday leaders of the six largest parties said that the cabinet has to take the result seriously . 
  ** 21:30 : second exit poll ** ipsos bases the exit poll on a poll at forty voting stations . 
  between 20.000 to 30.000 people have , at the request of ipsos , voted again . 
  tonight and during the night nearly all actual results will arrive . 
  those are the actual votes cast at the voting stations . 
  starting at 22:00 the results will be announced live in * nieuwsuur * on npo 2 . 
  ### end of translation . 
  going to be staying home for several reasons : 1 . 
  in favour of the agreement 2 . 
  against referenda 3 . 
  against having a referendum on this subject in particular 4 . 
  against the misleiding campaign, 
   they are talking about ` degrees of importance ' in terms of voter turnout - so that 's telling . 
  is this surprising ? 
  let 's assume that we reach the 30 % turnout and that a supermajority ( 67 % because that is what you would need to change the constitution ) is against the agreement . 
  that would end up being 20 % of eligible voters being against the agreement . 
  however this would leave 80 % either in favour of the agreement/status quo , neutral , in disagreement with the referendum in itself or not knowing or caring enough about the referendum itself . 
  quick edit : only at a turnout of 75 % with a supermajority of 67 % will the no-voters be in the absolute majority . 
  for any turnout that is below 75 % you can make the argument that only a minority of people are actually opposed to the agreement and a turnout of 75 % simply is n't going to happen . 
   this is also the reason why the unstressed suffix - lijk is pronounced as - lik or - luk based on dialect . 
  fortunately it does n't matter what you think . 
  if he has been caught alive it means that he had been hiding in the middle of the belgian capital for 4 months . 
  there is absolutely no way for any single person to be able to do this and shows that islamic extremism is a much larger issue in brussels/belgium .

  it does n't , but it does mean women wo n't be able to get into the higher levels of companies which is considered bad according to this statistic ( even if done so voluntarily ) .

   he was high on the polls in 2012  in 2012  2012, 
  he was high on the polls in 2012 and still lost 1/3rd of his seats . 
  a few years ago somebody fired grenades/rockets at a dutch court building . 
  people do weird things to intimidate eachother . 
  later in the article it says that this is based on numbers released by frontex . 
  the problem is that they claim to be from war torn countries and take the care away from people who actually do need the help . 
  more than half of the refugees who come to europe are not fleeing from war . 
  they are predominantly north-africans who have left their home country for economic reasons . 
  this has been said by eu commissioner frans timmermans in an interview with the nos . 
  `` it 's about 60 % of all refugees , '' timmermans says . 
  `` these are the people for which you can assume that they have no reason to ask for refugee status . '', 
  according to him they are people from countries such as morocco and tunisia who want to travel to europe through turkey . 
  timmermans bases his claims on the latest data from frontex . 
  the commissioner believes that these economic refugees should be sent back soon . 
  `` to keep the platform for sheltering refugees intact you have to deport these people as quickly as possible . '', 
  according to the president of the european council donald tusk the european refugee crisis should be solved within two months . 
  should that fail then he fears that the free travel of people and goods within europe has to come to an end . 
  timmermans agrees with this . 
  `` if we do n't make haste we have to revert to internal border controls . '', 
  according to the commissioner this will have large economic consequences . 
  `` it could cause hours , even days of delay at the inner borders . 
  this will result in great harm to the transport sector . '', 
  timmermans realises that ending the schengen area is no guarantee for solving the crisis . 
  `` if we follow the path of internal border controls we will be taking a huge risk . 
  the economics consequences are enormous without a guarantee that it will give the desired result ; namely less refugees entering europe . '', 
  in the interview timmermans also talks about the referendum about the association agreement with ukraine . 
  he believes that such a treaty will have positive effects for an exporting country such as the netherlands . 
  he does add that threatening for consequences when a `` no '' votes passes does not work in the netherlands . 
  people should be able to form their own opinions . 
  recently eu president juncker warned that a dutch `` no '' could have far reaching consequences . 
  they should and they do , however they do not have the right to use violence . 
  if you look at what other actions people have justified with that same slogan you can say so .
