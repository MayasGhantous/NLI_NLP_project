  because these angry letters are to the public telling them to throw stones and explosives and not to the government . 
  the police is n't going to arrest and prosecute people for every single message that can possibly be interpreted as hate speech . 
  this person called for people to ** resist ** the local government 's plan not to ** protest ** . 
  people are still allowed to disagree with refugees being housed near them so long as they do so in a legal way . 
  calling for people to use violence is the opposite of that . 
  protesting and resisting are two entirely different things . 
  protesting is using your voice to show disagreement with the government and its policies which is entirely legal in the netherlands so long as you have the permission to protest where you are going to protest . 
  resisting is showing disagreement with the government through violence which is illegal in nearly every country in the world . 
  they 're not being told to censor themselves to fit the state agenda . 
  what they are being told is that what they say can be considered hate speech which violates dutch law . 
   the only ** western ** european, 
  the only western european countries that have a leftist party as their largest party are france , italy , sweden and austria . 
  to be fair the wallonian part is along a river . 
  appearing on rt , telling your party members not to be critical of russia and being closely alligned with fn who have been proven to receive russian funding does not make it likely that the pvv receives russian funding ? 
  eenvandaag did a report on this , i 'll see if i can find it . 
  i remember reading a comment a few days/weeks ago where a redditor explained that this was because people are told that relationships should only be between a man and a woman . 
  if you then partake in a homosexual relationship you are breaking this `` rule '' . 
  to circumvent this they pressure homosexuals into becoming transsexual and change their birth certificates to make them women so that they can still partake in sexual acts with another man but now it 's `` heterosexual '' . 
  i forgot where exactly on this site i read it and if i do come across it again i 'll edit it in here . 
  should n't spanje be green too ( hispania ) ? 
  france 's regional elections are first-past-the-post so whoever gets the most votes gets to rule alone . 
  in the first half fn was the largest party in many of the regions but because they did n't have an absolute majority , elections were held again with the two most popular parties ( usually fn and ps/lr ) . 
  ps/lr voters did n't want fn to rule so they massively switched to whichever was left . 
  this would n't really work here because our national elections are simply based on how high of a percentage you get in total . 
  pvv has a lot of experience with those . 
  nothing . 
  that 's fine and all but do n't spend your entire campaign saying youre never going to change on that one point and then switch within the first 24 hours . 
  [ they really are n't . 
  a leftist conspiracy for sure . 
  the pvv is absolutely not `` centre-left '' . 
  i was still hopeful but no longer . 
  he set up a `` polenmeldpunt '' ( pole reporting center ) where people could report any pole that was taking their job or generally being a nuisance . 
  so what does count as racism according to you ? 
   wilders had already given in heavily regarding the age of pensioners going to 67 the one policy he said he would not budge on and he flipped on the first day . 
  great integrity . 
  yeah , let 's play the semantics game . 
  you know exactly what i mean . 
  fair enough although according to a quick google search he said so in november 2014 , october 2015 and again in november 2015 . 
  so saying you 're going to remove 30,000 people of a certain ethnicity is not racist ? 
  rutte recently reiterated that he would n't cooperate with the pvv because of the moroccan chant so wilders had to one up him by saying the pvv would n't work with the vvd because of rutte . 
  the pvv could of course decide to rule by themselves so long as the other parties do n't want to form a coalition with them . 
  will this work ? 
  absolutely not . 
  it was a straight up racist remark and any decent political party does not want to work together with one that says things like this . 
  wilders has had the government provide his security 24/7 for the past 11 years when it was revealed that the killer of theo van gogh had plans to assassinate wilders . 
  now that would be a shitfest . 
  i 'd assume a similar thing would happen as what happened in [ 2002 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_general_election,_2002 ) and [ 2003 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_general_election,_2003 ) . 
  pim fortuyn got assassinated in 2002 so in support people started flocking to his party lpf . 
  after a coalition had been formed conflicts started to appear with an inexperienced , failing lpf and elections were held again in 2003 which resulting in the lpf losing 70 % of their votes . 
  the pvv is more of an opposition party where they can yell at how bad everyone else is doing and i really really doubt ever seeing them join a coalition with any of the mainstream parties let alone get 51 % of the vote by themselves . 
  edit : this sort of already happened during the [ 2012 elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_general_election,_2012 ) after the pvv walked out on the coalition and they lost 9 of their 24 seats . 
  buma has already ruled out cooperating with the pvv because of their actions during rutte i. 
  there would n't be one . 
  pvv does n't want to cooperate with the vvd until rutte is gone , vvd does n't want to cooperate with the pvv until they apologise for the anti-moroccan chant from wilders . 
  cda has ruled out cooperating with the pvv because of what happened during the rutte i cabinet . 
  d66 , sp , pvda , pvdd and gl have ideological differences , cu is a mixed bag but heavily leaning towards a no which leaves 50plus , sgp and the other party to form a possible coalition . 
  last video is an edited out of context interview from dutch website geenstijl.nl . 
  the site has been sued and was ordered by the court to take down the video . 
  do n't spread misinformation . 
  because it 's 53 % of 35 % which is 19 % of the population against the agreement . 
  the other 81 % is either in favour , does not care or does not mind . 
  you ca n't really call them successful if there have n't been elections yet . 
  if i remember correctly they barely have a seat in the polls and those fluctuate quite often . 
  this policy has been taken over by the pvv-offshoot [ vnl ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/groep_bontes/van_klaveren ) though . 
   could you be more specific ? 
  if you have the exact launch position i would like to see it . 
  an image of the area is on [ page 146 of the official report . 
  ] ( http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/uploads/phase-docs/1006/debcd724fe7breport-mh17-crash.pdf ) the entire section starting on page 143 goes into detail about where the missile was fired from . 
   that 's a rather large area , was all of that controlled by the rebels during that time ? 
  according to the report it was . 
  the criminal investigation has n't ended yet and the safety board did not have the authority to put blame on someone . 
  the safety board did say that the missile was fired from rebel controlled territory so make of that what you want . 
  is n't it because journalism is typically a more left wing profession ? 
  people want to show injustices done around the world and that is more in line with left wing ideology . 
  but where did they come from before settling in the lesser lands ? 
  that 's right , [ the north ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/les_francs_entre_400_et_440.svg/1920px-les_francs_entre_400_et_440.svg.png ) !, 
  [ our ships ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/admiral_benelux ), 
  i 'd guess that the turkish airforce released this to show that they did warn that the plane was approaching turkish airspace even though russia claims otherwise . 
  turkey claims that the plane did not respond to emergency calls made by their air force and violated their airspace . 
  russia claims that the plane never entered turkish airspace . 
  what the pilot has said is that the plane flew over turkish airspace and was warned several times that it was about to do so . 
  turkey does not have the authority to shoot down planes over other countries so by taking the satellite image from the turkish ministry of defense , the fact that turkey does not have the authority to shoot down planes in syria and that according to the pilot the plane was warned multiple times that it was about to do so you could say that the plan must have violated turkish airspace or there was no reason for turkey to shoot it down at all . 
  whether turkey was justified and used proper force in shooting down a plane for flying over a 2,5 km stretch of land is another question . 
  the pilot was also never identified as dutch as per his request to remain anonymous . 
  tldr : airline pilot who took off from turkey this morning claims that he heard a call on a turkish emergency frequency about a plane entering turkish airspace if it did n't change course . 
  later he saw turkish f-16s pass his plane and was told to fly low in order not to disturb them . 
  ** it was supposed to be an ordinary flight , but that changed quickly when two f-16s flew past his cockpit . 
  a pilot who flew for a commercial airline this morning was put in the middle of an international conflict . 
  he tells his story to rtl nieuws ** `` just after we took off we heard an emergency call from the turkish air force on an emergency frequency . 
  it warned of an incoming plane that would enter turkish airspace if it did n't not change course immediately '' , says the pilot who wishes to remain anonymous . 
  rtl nieuws has investigated his background . 
  according to the pilot the warning was repeated multiple times and the frequency of the warning went up when the plane passed the turkish-syrian border . 
  ** ` did n't hear the russians once ' ** at one point the pilot received a request to stay low , because f-16s were coming his direction . 
  in the meantime the turkish air force kept warning the russian plane . 
  `` the plane was literally called tens of times by the turks , but no answer was received . 
  not once did we hear the russians , so they did n't answer '' , the pilot says , who could follow everything through his radio . 
  shortly after the warning to stay low he saw the f-16s appear on the radar of his own plane . 
  `` they flew just above us allowing us to see them clearly . 
  after they passed us we were allowed to continue with our flight '' , he says . 
  ** ` deliberately in turkish airspace ' ** even though the pilot could not see the russian plane , not even on radar , he is sure that the downed plane flew over turkey .
