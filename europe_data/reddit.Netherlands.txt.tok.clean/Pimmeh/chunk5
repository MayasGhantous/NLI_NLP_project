  `` the turkish f-16s never headed towards syria , so they fired at the russian in turkish airspace '' , he says . 
  `` there is no other option than that the russian plane deliberately violated turkish airspace , because there was no lack of turkish attempts for contact . '', 
  russia denies that the russian jet entered turkish airspace . 
  however cnn turkey has published a map showing the flight path of the russian plane which shows that the plane did indeed fly above turkey . 
  russian president putin has shown his disdain over the downing of the plane . 
  i ca n't find a direct link to the source but this is what various sites list . 
   while canadian submarines have routinely taken on u.s. navy carriers , other small navies have enjoyed similar victories . 
  the royal netherlands navy , with its small force of extremely quiet diesel submarines , has made the u.s. navy eat the proverbial slice of humble pie on more than one occasion . 
  in 1989 , naval analyst norman polmar wrote in naval forces that during nato 's exercise northern star , `` ... the dutch submarine `` zwaardvis '' was the only orange ( enemy ) submarine to successfully stalk and sink a blue ( allied ) aircraft carrier ... '' the carrier in question might have been the u.s.s. 
  america , as it was a participant in this exercise . 
  ten years later there were reports that the dutch submarine walrus had been even more successful in the exercise jtfex/tmdi99 . 
  `` during this exercise the walrus penetrates the u.s. screen and ` sinks ' many ships , including the u.s. aircraft carrier theodore roosevelt cvn-71 . 
  the submarine launches two attacks and manages to sneak away . 
  to celebrate the sinking the crew designed a special t-shirt . '' fittingly , the t-shirt depicted the u.s.s. 
  theodore roosevelt impaled on the tusks of a walrus . 
  it was also reported that the walrus sank many of the roosevelt 's escorts , including the nuclear submarine u.s.s. 
  boise , a cruiser , several destroyers and frigates , plus the command ship u.s.s. 
  mount whitney . 
  the walrus herself survived the exercise with no damage . 
  some u.s.n. 
  apologists might counter by saying that the exercise was probably scripted , and the dutch submarine probably knew exactly where the carrier was , had an unfair advantage , and that in a real war , the submarine would have been easily detected and destroyed . 
  if so , then why would the dutch submariners , a very professional and well-trained group , take such delight in simply completing a scripted `` shoot the fish in a barrel '' scenario ? 
  talented and wily enemies , of course , usually do n't play by the rules . 
  a predecessor of those dutch subs managed to sink a us carrier group during a nato training exercise in the 1980 's . 
  that 's the opinion of the coalition labour party . 
  the article does not mention anything about the ruling party wanting to wait for the southern european countries to fail instead they are saying that these countries have already failed by not following the rules and because they are n't we should n't either . 
  the dutch cabinet is in talks with belgium , luxembourg , germany and austria about a mini-schengen area . 
  the five countries want to form a smaller area within the schengen area in which people are free to travel . 
  on the outside borders of this area there should be effective passport checks to better control the flow of immigrants . 
  sources confirm news of de telegraaf about a so called mini-schengen area . 
  ** asylum quota ** the cabinet also considers an asylum quota where the netherlands will shelter a predetermined number of asylum seekers . 
  people are free to travel within the schengen area without having to present a passport . 
  the area consists of 22 eu-members and 4 non-members . 
  passport checks only happen on the outside borders but lately this practice has been stopped . 
  ** unorthodox measures ** vvd party leader zijlstra ( liberal ruling party ) considers the mini-schengen area a good idea : `` it can count on our support . 
  the migrant flow has been so high lately that we must take unorthodox measures . '', 
  according to zijlstra european countries are not following the rules . 
  `` we should say that the rules are fine , but we 're not going to be the last country which follows them . '', 
  pvda party leader samson ( labour , coalition partner ) responds more carefully . 
  `` i do n't think it 's a good idea , but a good alternative if the good idea fails '' , he says . 
  samson wants to look for a solution within the eu . 
  if that cant happen then countries should not close their borders by themselves , the party leader says : `` this has to be prevented by all costs . 
  mini-schengen would be an alternative . 
  if that fails then you will get a europe where everyone is for themself . '', 
  an asylum quota is impossible according to samson : `` the refugee treaty obliges us to give safe shelter to people who flee here . 
  a quota in terms of absolute numbers ca n't happen . '', 
  d66-mp verhoeven ( social-liberal opposition party ) is not positive about the plan : `` closing borders in a panicked manner would be a bomb underneath the eu . 
  creating a mini-fort within the eu would not be an option for us . '', 
  he believes that the refugee crisis should be solved by having all eu members work together . 
  ** not workable ** revision of the schengen agreement is not a new idea . 
  early this month state secretary dijkhoff ( vvd , state secretary of safety and justice ) said that after discussion with eu colleagues that the refugee flow proves that the current system does not work . 
  earlier this summer german chancellor merkel warned that the agreement is dead if other countries do not accept more refugees . 
  `` if we ca n't divide them equally then we must talk about the future of schengen , '' she said . 
  dutch way since forever . 
  that happened a few years ago when a bus full of belgian children crashed in a tunnel after coming back from a school trip . 
  yes , what is your question ? 
   could you provide the page ? 
  section 3.8.6 from pages 143 to 147 . 
  the report states that a buk missile fired from a rebel controlled area directly caused the crash . 
  the reason why it does not blame russia is because that goes outside of the board 's jurisdiction , finding out who shot it down is the responsibility of the criminal investigator . 
  however it does put blame on ukraine because the board says that ukraine was aware that the rebels had access to a buk system and should not have allowed planes to fly in the area . 
  this investigation does not concern itself with who was responsible for the crash . 
  only what caused it . 
  on page 99 it states that during victim identification they found one passenger with an emergency oxygen mask with the strap around his neck and the mask on his throat . 
  however the report does state that there was no information on how the body was found at the crash site . 
  this could mean two things : 1 . 
  not all passengers lost consciousness immediately . 
  at least one passenger was able to get the mask around his neck and possibly on his mouth . 
  the state of the body was altered at the crash site and someone on the ground applied the mask . 
  yes ? 
  got any links to that ? 
  it went on right when the video was over . 
  it really ca n't be . 
  the preliminary assumption from the internet is that the rebels mistook mh17 for a ukrainian transport plane and shot it down . 
  moments after the crash one of the rebels boasted on social media that they had downed a ukrainian plane but the message was deleted soon after . 
  i do n't think people are blaming russia directly but they are considered responsible . 
  they support the rebels , the negotiate for the rebels and they supply the rebels . 
  if they had supplied the buk system or the operators then they are partially to blame . 
  `` buk missile came from seperatist controlled territory '' - t.h.j. 
  joustra chairman of the dutch safety board dutch article : http://nos.nl/artikel/2062876-joustra-buk-kwam-uit-separatistengebied.html, 
  russia today stream cut out during the video reconstruction : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohcno_zvf_q&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1733, 
  holy fuck the stream went out just when they showed the digital recreation of the crash then went back on when it ended . 
  or maybe `` the west '' wishes to write a report based on facts and research rather than make unsubstantiated claims . 
  various western countries have already said russia is at fault and have disproven russian evidence when it comes to the crash of mh17 . 
  writing a report like this takes time and if you do not have immediate access to the crash site it will only take longer . 
  they are not confirming anything when it comes to whodunnit . 
  only thing the investigator said was that they have found buk fragments but the jit has n't confirmed their findings yet . 
  could be ukraine , could be rebels , could be putin . 
  short translation : buk missile parts were found in the plane and bodies of mh-17 victims according to ukraine 's former head of the investigation vasyl vovk . 
  ukraine has made two buk systems available to tear down and confirm whether this is true or not . 
  the joint investigation confirmed vovk 's involvement in the investigation but has labelled his claims as `` careless '' and while the theory of mh-17 being shot down by a buk missile is the most likely theory they do not wish to rule out others . 
  for obraka, 
  friend of mine sent that screenshot to me last night and now it 's shown on national media after some guy posted it on twitter . 
  the dams and dikes are already there to protect against rising water levels so it is n't as if they will suddenly start flooding . 
  to flood the afsluitdijk for example the water would have to rise 7 meter and that simply wo n't happen or wo n't happen fast enough to not be able to increase its height . 
  they 're pretty difficult to take down unless your have access to some very heavy explosives . 
  the afsluitdijk which goes across the water in the left picture is 90 meter wide and 7 meter high . 
  the [ various dams in zeeland ] ( http://www.deltawerken.com/modules/mediagallery/images/maps/dammen.jpg ) range from 20 meter to 100 meter of nearly pure concrete , metal and soil . 
  more of a `` dutch expected to give opinion on eu-ukraine treaty '' . 
  the dutch troops requested aerial support against the serbs but some nato countries ( the us , uk and france i believe ) made a deal with the serbs where they would n't use those against them anymore .
