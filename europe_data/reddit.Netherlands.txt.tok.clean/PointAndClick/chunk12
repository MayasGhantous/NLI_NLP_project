  thankfully [ this link ] ( http://www.destentor.nl/nieuws/algemeen/show/11604323/wilders,-hitler-en-breivik-op-prent-bennie-jolink.ece ) shows that we are not all fooled . 
  you 'll see hitler , wilders and breivik painted by a dutch singer , who want to use it as a background for his concerts . 
  wilders was of course not amused . 
  alright , yes i think we can agree on your explanation . 
  you are talking about something different now . 
  you keep throwing things at me without addressing anything i said in response to what came out of your keyboard earlier . 
  it 's quite annoying and not a fair way of communicating with others . 
  anyway , yes , you can be somewhere in the middle . 
  and the political spectrum is accommodating for these different approaches . 
  but  people have to stop equating the financial industry with capitalism ... like it 's the same . 
  is because they are currently the same . 
  possible existence of views in the middle have absolutely nothing to do with the reality of what these systems are currently . 
  it only says something about their ability to change . 
  the free market leads to out competing which leads to assimilation . 
  all born out of [ accumulation of capital ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_accumulation ) . 
  this is what marx had to say about it : * `` it is concentration of capitals already formed , destruction of their individual independence , expropriation of capitalist by capitalist , transformation of many small into few large capitals ... capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand , because it has in another place been lost by many ... 
  the battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities . 
  the cheapness of commodities demands , caeteris paribus , on the productiveness of labour , and this again on the scale of production . 
  therefore , the larger capitals beat the smaller . 
  it will further be remembered that , with the development of the capitalist mode of production , there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions . 
  the smaller capitals , therefore , crowd into spheres of production which modern industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of . 
  here competition rages ... 
  it always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists , whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors , partly vanish . 
  '' * i 'm expressing it in simplified form , but by no means is this solely my opinion . 
  nor a secret or anything , it 's common knowledge . 
  * `` capitalism is an economic system that is based on private ownership of the means of production and the creation of goods or services for profit . 
  '' * let 's get that definition straight here . 
  * `` socialism is an economic system characterised by social ownership and cooperative management of the means of production , and a political philosophy advocating such a system . 
  '' * and this one as well . 
  so you can see a few differences , private ownership vs. social ownership . 
  currently this makes the financial sector equal with the capitalist ideal . 
  the financial sector is a privately owned for profit enterprise . 
  in general : regulation is a socialist goal , deregulation is a capitalist/liberal goal . 
  vvd and pvv are our right wing liberal parties . 
  our purchasing power has only been [ decreasing ] ( http://www.spaarbaak.nl/art_inflatie_vs_koopkracht.html ) ( link in dutch ) between 1991 and 2005 , guess what , those are the years when we started going free market and deregulation . 
  as a continuation of the privatization movement that started in the 80 's . 
  [ more on that here ] ( http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/webwijs/files/center/vdamme/aelementair.pdf ) ( in dutch ) it did the opposite of making us prosperous , it made us less prosperous . 
  `` the economy '' between companies banking and trading did great . 
  sure . 
  josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , * `` i no longer believe in the market 's self-healing power . 
  '' * to name one . 
  and i gave an example of the monopolies being formed in the link that i gave . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%e2%80%932009_keynesian_resurgence ) might also provide some nice reading material . 
  you can find the quote i gave there as well . 
  ( links will be in dutch ) * right-wing populism is a combination of ethno-nationalism with anti-elitist populist rhetoric and a radical critique of existing political institutions . 
  according to margaret canovan , a right-wing populist is '' ... a charismatic leader , using the tactics of politicians ' populism to go past the politicians and intellectual elite and appeal to the reactionary sentiments of the populace , often buttressing his claim to speak for the people by the use of referendums . 
  '' * [ link to what he said , again ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2012/05/01/wilders-wil-dat-nederland-uit-europese-unie-stapt/ ) * the far-right , ( also known as the extreme right or radical right ) refers to the highest degree of rightism in right-wing politics . 
  far right politics involves support of strong or complete social hierarchy in society , and supports supremacy of certain individuals or groups deemed to be innately superior who are to be more valued than those deemed to be innately inferior . 
  * [ again a link ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2824/politiek/article/detail/3249012/2012/05/01/wilders-in-nederland-anti-europa-in-de-vs-anti-islam.dhtml ) . 
  and his anti-islam policies are well known . 
  he started the [ ifa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_freedom_alliance ) . 
  * fascists seek elevation of their nation based on commitment to an organic national community where its individuals are united together as one people in national identity . 
  * [ i redirect you here for that one ] ( http://digitalehofstad.wordpress.com/2012/01/06/geert-wilders-pvv-zit-in-fase-2-van-het-fascisme/ ) so he is extreme far right populist and fascist . 
  there is no debate about this . 
  and i 'm going to repeat that i have absolutely no respect for your view . 
  you are way to lightheartedly about this . 
  [ the germans ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/02/wilders_angry_at_german_rightw.php ) have no trouble calling it as it is . 
  he was banned from entering the uk . 
  the guy is a problem for us and showing the state of our country . 
  i urge you to change your views on the pvv drastically . 
  call it as it is and do n't look that cat out of the tree . 
  the growth and profit models necessary , make it impossible for markets to be self sustainable . 
  the only possible outcome is a monopoly . 
  which is what we see all over the world , lesser and lesser companies own more and more . 
  big companies buying out smaller companies , most of the competition in the market is false competition . 
  a competition in daughter companies , not in our benefit . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228354.500-revealed--the-capitalist-network-that-runs-the-world.html#bx283545b1 ) . 
  private ownership is a red herring . 
  because private in this context means : in the hands of a company . 
  with companies having revenues into the billions , it might prove a much wiser decision to have democratic oversight over this money . 
  because this money represents a lot of power , it 's not wise to have it deciding over our healthcare , our shared infrastructure , telecom , the internet and the countries resources . 
  corruption and greed are linked with inequality , poor living standards and people having to fend for themselves . 
  you know what parts of the city you need to stay out of and where crime is higher , it 's not in the posh parts . 
  the examples are on the street . 
  if you want to help society prosper and thrive , you do this with equality , free education , social security and good healthcare . 
  not by turning the country into a for-profit company . 
  we have been a socialist democracy for the past 150 years . 
  it has made us one of the most prosperous nations in the world . 
  what are you trying to defend ? 
  if you are one of those people who think it 's okay to vote for pvv , we are done talking . 
  i have no respect for that . 
  we all know that the financial sector has created exploding bubbles and that we the tax payer are paying for these capitalist ideals . 
  you want a silver lining around that ? 
  i 'm very much socialist and anti-capitalist . 
  i 'm extremely glad that we have political leaders in this country with a true socialist ideal . 
  so that i do n't have to go and protest out in the streets , but go to the ballot box and make a difference there . 
  i suggest you do the same . 
  i reacted here for clarifications . 
  and to make sure that the european ideals of the socialist party were reflected honestly . 
  if you want to check it out against the party line : [ here ] ( http://youtu.be/_quo_v6hjqy ) is a discussion with roemer . 
  or at [ stemwijzer ] ( http://www.stemkijker.nl/europa/sp ) . 
  check it out . 
  ( edit : those links are all in dutch , sorry english speaking readers . ), 
  are you kidding me !, 
  you need to educate yourself . 
  . . to stop with this will only work when we step out of the european union and the euro . ), 
  straight out of his mouth . 
  so , really , really , really . 
   it blames market regulation and rules set up by the same people who directly profit from these rules . 
  those are my exact words , you are misrepresenting me .
