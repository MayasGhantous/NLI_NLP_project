  which would lead to higher employment . 
  it was during reagan/thatcher / ( kok if you 're dutch ) that supply-side economics was able to be ` tested ' and failed . 
  simple as that . 
  we 're still under the influence of these ideas and we 're still hurt by these ideas . 
  even though this economic policy has been shown not to work and fail many times and by many experts . 
  at most like 40-45 average . 
  ( beaufort 8 . ), 
  above 65 you already ca n't walk around anymore , there would also be a lot of damage to property , shit flying around and too dangerous to be out in the open . 
  i 'd say 65 mph is the edge of where you can physically walk up against the wind as a normal healthy adult . 
  [ yes . 
  i totally agree with you . 
  still there is no reason to misquote him , other than to further the nationalist-turkish agenda by \u00d6zyar in sabah . 
  \u00d6zyar ( the journalist ) is insinuating that this group is being harassed ( by police and locals ) because this youth talked positively about erdogan on social media . 
  positive is a bit of an understatement when they call themselves `` erdogan warriors '' . 
  they tear up the streets . 
  this was 100 % not a protest . 
  \u00d6zyar is definitely doing his job , spinning the news in favor of erdogan . 
  but he definitely knew that this group of youth is extremely controversial and watched closely by the police , and that it would get him in trouble if he aligned himself with them on the street in any way . 
  the controversy suits his agenda well and it 's most likely intentional on his part . 
  the rutte comments is a. taken out of context and b. not literal . 
  the actual quote of rutte , which came after the actual demonstrations and unrest after the coup attempt in turkey , when shown an incident where protesters harassed , and later physically , a television news crew was : `` my first instinctive feeling is , you leave . 
  go back to turkey yourself , piss off ( pleur op ) i would say in common local tongue . '', 
  and he continued to say , we have the freedom to protest and the freedom of press , this is not a model where you can pick and choose . 
  [ incident can be seen here ] ( http://www.dagelijksestandaard.nl/2016/07/nederturkse-hooligans-belagen-nederlandse-media-in-rotterdam/ ) . 
  there is a strong anti-western media sentiment with pro-erdogan supporters . 
  a theme that continues with \u00d6zyar . 
  non-erdogan and gulen supporting dutch-turks have also been harassed and threatened . 
  not a word in sabah about that , it 's pretty clear what sabbah is about and their journalists are wearing their agenda on their sleeves . 
  what part of society is * not * based on `` historical baggage '' , with that logic we should also include things like democracy , law and human rights themselves . 
  it 's just too narrow to use `` historical baggage '' exclusively pejoratively . 
  besides that , new religions are allowed to enter free western society . 
  there is no cap on the amount of religions , there is no guideline on what a religion ought to be . 
  the only thing a religious person is required to do is to adhere to our secular laws . 
  those laws are the only cap on our freedoms . 
  this is not about treating religion as a special category , this is about treating mein kampf as a special category . 
  the ban is on mein kampf , not on religion . 
  nobody is comparing mein kampf to the koran without an agenda . 
  otherwise one could compare it to any other book , religious or not . 
  that 's exactly the same argument erdogan supporters use to get rid of gulen supporters . 
  `` shit like this '' ( death threats , threat of violence , call for deportation , etc. ), 
  happens all the time from all kinds of different ideologies , from nationalists to hooligans , we have nazis here and extreme left . 
  and they break the law , they go to jail or get fined or whatever . 
  if you enjoy deportation of political enemies , maybe you 're the one who needs to go live in turkey . 
  how can you possibly live in a democracy and advocate to get rid of people who do n't share your political opinions . 
  there is only one ideology that advocates for these things and that is nationalism . 
  but the fact is , these erdogan supporters ( de facto turkish nationalists ) are free to do whatever they want here . 
  there is however a price to pay for breaking the law . 
  fighting nationalism with more nationalism is just plain old stupidity , then nobody is on the right side of the debate . 
  that 's probably the most racist comment you could respond with and you should be ashamed of yourself . 
   are you sure ?!, 
  do you have even a single example of similar situation that was punished in the past ? 
  an example that comes to mind is the jail time that members of the so called ` hofstadgroep ' received for crimes they did not yet commit . 
   do n't forget that in your country they give community service as punishment for manslaughter that was 20 years ago ? 
  deported ? 
  these are dutch people , born in the netherlands for the most part . 
  it has never been a secret that we have a majority of erdogan supporters in the turkish community here . 
  in any case , these threats are always taken seriously and we have laws that citizens need to abide to . 
  at least here they are * not * free to do whatever the fuck they want , here they * will * end up in jail . 
  if we deport them to turkey , nothing happens to them . 
  justice needs to prevail . 
  yeah let 's not fucking forget that he is anti-muslim and that that is his only concern in life . 
  he is a one policy party and * that 's exactly why he is a populist * . 
  he is a populist in a left leaning country . 
  that 's why he is left-center ... but his main ideals certainly are n't left . 
  he said multiple times that he 's going to live his pension there . 
  it has everything to do with economic policies . 
  the left right dichotomy is drawn over economic lines . 
  right = small government , tax cuts , free market . 
  left = taxation , legislation and government oversight . 
  right is lowering social security , for financial economic reasons . 
  right is anti-immigrant to protect the job market , another economic reason . 
  it 's all economy . 
  wilders populism is for a large part aimed at low income households , again economics . 
  they teach their kids that their cows are ghosts ? 
  unacceptable !, 
  dutch : cat : * miauw , prrrrr * dog : * woef * horse : * hihi * cow : * moe * sheep : * b\u00e8\u00e8\u00e8 * pig : * knor * chicken : * tok tok * rooster : * kukelekuu * bird : * tjilp * donkey : * ii-aa * monkey : * oeh-oeh aa-aa * fish : * blub * dove : * roe-koe * duck : * kwaak , kwak-kwak * geese : * gak * snake : * sssssj * seal : * oeink oeink * crow : * krakra * bee : * zoem * parrot : * lorre * mouse : * piep * wolf : * woehoe * then we have birds named after their call , most famous : koekoek , tjiftjaf , kievit . 
  [ source , i 'm dutch and i took some of this list ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/lijst_van_dierengeluiden ), 
  sad !, 
   it 's the way he does it and fear of the policies that he 'll enact that fuels these threats . 
   it 's the way he does it  he does it okay . 
  i think you 're misreading what you said . 
  what other reason would al qaeda have , other than wilders being an anti-islamic `` crusader '' ( their words ) . 
  excuse me ? 
  he has been on public islamic extremist hit lists since 2005 . 
  he was in the top5 of a list given out in al qaeda 's [ inspire magazine ] ( http://www.geenstijl.nl/archives/images/opklikadvertentieinspire.png ) . 
  so , no , you 're wrong . 
  yeah , but be careful where you message . 
  just because we 're disturbed about this now , does n't mean we stopped being disturbed about other things . 
  we 're not hypocrites just because we 're denouncing `` incidental '' things . 
  if you come to me when my uncle dies of cancer and you step in and say , `` that 's just incidental , millions of people die every year of malnutrition ... '' i 'll punch you straight in the face . 
  [ here is a wiki on it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flood_control_in_the_netherlands ) , also the source of this map . 
  [ here some maps and more info ] ( http://dutchdikes.net/ ) . 
   `` it 's their right , and we ca n't do anything about that , but they can just as well stop because it 's only meaningless nonsense '' you 're totally wrong . 
  this is exactly what `` democracy '' looks like . 
  it 's not just `` their right '' . 
  this is the way in which democracy is expressed . 
  it happens all the time , it 's a continuous process . 
  it 's not just happening in a specific period for that one minute in the voting booth when everybody is sufficiently propagandized ... 
  when under a totalitairian regime people get into protests and violently clash with their non-democratic government , we call it democracy . 
  when in a democratic country a group peacefully comes together to show how much demand there is for an idea , you 're suddenly going to call it a hobby ?
