  nato ensured long-term instability in the region , and got itself a reputation for being self-righteous interventionist pricks . 
  playing into the hand of anyone who wants to use nato as a threatening boogeyman . 
  rather unsuitable persona 's to have in authoritative positions . 
  what the fuck were those cops thinking ? 
  even if they expected to find some hard-core anarchist insurrectionists prepping molotovs , the objective should always be ` contain & de-escalate ' . 
  the state has to pay , good . 
  but what happens with the individuals who thought going on a power-trip fuelled rampage was appropriate ? 
  stop, 
  earlier yesterday i was cautioning people for the sliding slope of convenience , and less than 12 hours later i fall for it myself :( . 
  funny how my mind tried to rationalise an instinctive ( tribal ) thought-pattern . 
  thank you for taking the time to write that down . 
  the question remains weather france is actively ` hunting them down ' , or simply providing intel to iraqi forces with the request to capture these individuals specifically ( and being on iraqi soil they 'll be subject to iraqi laws , and capture is simply tricky in a war-zone ) . 
   they are correlated with a high mental illness rate . 
  people who do n't feel accepted for who they are , and have to live a lie under pressure of society tend to . 
  it is n't caused by their sexuality . 
   they have a higher stds rate . 
  matter of education . 
  also being homosexual does n't make you sexcrazed or compelled to fuck every other gay you meet . 
  current stats are a remnemant from a time when it was a hidden secretive activity and was performed unsafe . 
  education and not having to hide your affection will fix that  they have a higher pedophilia rate . 
  simply not true . 
  maybe you are thinking certain sexually frustrated religious folk with a tendency of power-abuse ? 
   they ( people that claim to have an inborn exclusive homosexual identity ) are a recent artificial western invention and not natural . 
  recent ? 
  like sometime during the last 20 000 years ? 
  all mammels exhibit homosexual behaviour in a percentage of the populace  they lower the birth rate . 
  secular arguments ? 
  like society cares about even * more * babies  they recruit more people into their lifestyle by promoting it as normal to kids at a young age thus increasing the rate of all of the above . 
  they promote mental wellbeing so young people understand such differences are perfectly normal and they wo n't have to deal with lifelong mental trauma . 
  kids/adolescents can be absurtly evil towards those perceived as ` different ' . 
  teach them young to see certain people as less than human and they 'll never overcome it . 
  government killing it 's own citizens ? 
  might matter ? 
  i blame the guy who * did n't * fucking tie the rope to the bridge . 
  `` go jump '' you say ? 
    justice is always a balance between pragmatism and coulance . 
   this is an interesting take on justice . 
  throughout history society judged and punished according to morality and ability . 
  medieval people might have * wanted * to apply fine-grained case-by-case custom punishments , but were limited by limited forensic technology and limited resources . 
  they could n't afford to care for , or rehabilitate all criminals . 
  thus corporeal punishments , cutting body parts off , and death were ` pragmatic ' solutions to achieve justice ( in the eyes of society , maybe not the individual cases ) we can , and * do * better today , but we do n't have absolute control of every situation . 
  specifically , religious nut-jobs that do n't care about our ideas of justice or appropriate punishment . 
  capturing , returning , and convicting all these terrorists can be done in a perfect world . 
  even if they do n't even regard our punishment as a punishment ( what is 15 years in jail if you are still alive and can still communicate your holy message ? ), 
  the powers that be in france have judged ( perhaps incorrectly ) that the threat of these people returning on their own ( bringing the war with them ) is large enough that granting the ` coulance ' of a fine grained trial with humane punishments is n't achievable ( without a too high risk , or perhaps too high costs ) . 
  they are perhaps wrong in that assessment . 
  i 'm not immune to the media narrative either , though with my meagre understanding of the situation i agree , or at least defer the decision to them . 
    and given the situation , i 'm inclined to give in to tribalism : us vs them , and then i choose us . 
   ftfy : i ca n't wait for an excuse to give in to tribalism my comment did n't provide much nuance , true . 
  but for me it is not just ` an excuse ' . 
  it is my best assessment given the struggle versus a foe that does n't give a shit about any of our moral philosophy . 
  and i do n't think i betray any of that philosophy , when under direct threat , i choose pragmatism . 
  edit , sorry , did n't intent to make it such a wall-o-text , but you seemed to desire a bit more nuance . 
  brilliant, 
  i check under my bed every night for russians . 
  not possible , sorry . 
  you and and your countrymen are ` guilty by association ' , thanks to international politics . 
  almost nothing you as individual can do , can fix that . 
  not even adding a 100 word introduction to every post will stop people from assigning you to a side in the narrative . 
  though we personally can still be friends , ok ? 
   ** suspected ** islamist will be prosecuted for something like possession of drugs , a ** charge the police will rarely go out of their way to bother ** without it being blatant to get them off the streets because they ** ca n't find enough evidence ** to charge them with terrorism offences sliding slope in effect . 
  i understand the sentiment , especially when something happens and the ' * was known by the police * ' hits the media the shit-storm is complete . 
  still tricky . 
  nope , my bad , fixed . 
  yea , my bad . 
  that 's what i get for not reading the article , and the ` warning flair ' had n't been applied yet when i made the comment . 
  i 'm not denying europe has some stuff to figure uit regarding conflicting value-systems and immigrants . 
  just when the police says ` we do n't want to help you ' you also have some other big problems . 
  edit : anacdotes , * if * they said such a thing it would be bad , no proof , putting away pitchfork now . 
  like a 12 step program and be proclaimed belgian citizen ? 
  that sounds hilarious . 
  and scary . 
  does go to court on a case-by-case basis ? 
  it 's a sliding slope , especially when the data * is just there * ( who 's gon na find out if we check this one guys data and get a few pointers where to look for incriminating evidence we otherwise would n't find ? ), 
  calculated risk , they prevent proven terrorist from returning , in exchange they risk ( multiple ? ), 
  family members seeking revenge . 
  how well do we trust the french muslim populace to act ` rational ' and blame the terrorists themselves for getting killed in misguided holy wars ? 
  i 'm sure they 'll never abuse the convenience of having that data at hand . 
  because in a state of law it * is * bad . 
  lucky us they picked a lawless hellhole to fight their holy war . 
  yes , * unfortunately * they happen to have joined a terrorist organisation and actively participate in a war-zone . 
  justice is always a balance between pragmatism and coulance . 
  i do feel like it 's * wrong * , yet i have no realistic alternative . 
  and given the situation , i 'm inclined to give in to tribalism : us vs them , and then i choose us . 
  meh , it 's ` grey ' . 
  technically wrong , since they are * technically * still french citizens . 
  in practice , it 's taking the opportunity to make sure the problems do n't travel back from a war-zone to europe . 
  * especially * civilised systems are vulnerable to people who lack ` manners ' . 
  sometimes you have to accept certain losses and risks in free society ( else we would n't be free ) . 
  in a twisted sense i 'm glad they went to syria , giving france the opportunity to ` solve ' the problem . 
  when/if they return they are a great risk to french society . 
  i 'd say it is a very pragmatist way of preventing that by making sure they do n't . 
  i do n't even think this is ` extra-judicial killing ' , they joined a terrorist organisation , and it is after all , a war-zone . 
  making them priority targets is justified * because they are * . 
  ~ ~ while the incident can be blamed on a fringe-case idiot , the police reaction is a major red flag . ~ ~ anecdotal speculation , best to ignore it . 
  ` popular science ' news has an inherent conflict of interest . 
  most science , especially high-energy particle physics , is rather boring number grinding . 
  so anytime any institution or technology breaks into ` popular ' territory you 're guaranteed to have people go nuts ' i have heard of that ! ', 
  when it 's mentioned . 
  exactly , the thingamajic needs to interface with the false-vacuum globulator through the positron flux capacitor .
