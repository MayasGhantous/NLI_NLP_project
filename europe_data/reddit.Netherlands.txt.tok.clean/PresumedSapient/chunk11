  we 're almost there !, 
  i know , i study physics myself , and your rebuttal is the exact same i use whenever i feel like debunking stupid . 
  i did forget the ' / s ' though ... fixed now . 
  you 'd have about a dozen euro . 
  now 1 $ for every * person * that spouts conspiracy-crap about cern ... 
  the number of people i heard saying something along the lines of ` hawking radiation is unproven , we do n't know micro-wormholes will evaporate , cern will destroy us all ! ', 
  is quite depressing . 
  russian politics ca n't survive without an enemy ( neither can us politics , for that matter ), 
  us politics do n't do coalitions , it 's all or nothing , no cooperation , no compromise between the parties . 
  some also argue nato is an extention of us power ( them being the most powerful and influential member ) , making nato group of ` followers ' in stead of a coalition of equals . 
  both opnions are wrong , but it 's regular us-bashing material \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  so , the solution is that the usa , eu and russia create a * new ** coalition . 
  that way they do n't have to ` join ' .

  dutch article : http://nos.nl/artikel/2180214-hof-staat-aansprakelijk-voor-350-slachtoffers-srebrenica.html ** translation : ** the dutch state is partially responsible for the death of almost 350 muslim men in srebrenica . 
  the court in the hague judged in a case set by 6000 relatives of the victims . 
  this concerns the men who were at the dutch hq in potocari directly after the fall of srebrenica in july 1995 . 
  the dutch military should not have sent them of the terrain , because according to the court there had been sufficient indications they would be killed by troops of the bosnian-serbian general mladic . 
  dutchbat could have stopped the men , because it had judicial authority in the compound . 
  the court estimates the chance they would n't have been killed 30 percent . 
  the relatives of the 350 are entitled to financial compensation . 
  ** other men ** the dutch military have also acted unlawfully during the evacuation of the men who were outside the hq terrain . 
  the dutch assisted in the orderly evacuation to safe territory within two days after the fall of srebrenica it was clear that men who were taken for ` interrogation ' by the bosnian-serbs were murdered . 
  yet the dutch kept cooperating with the evacuation . 
  the relatives of these men are not entitled to a financial compensation . 
  the men outside of the compound would have been taken and killed by the bosnian serbs even if the dutch had n't cooperated , says the court . 
  bosnian civilians and muslims combatants were besieged in 1995 by troops of the bosnian-serbian general mladic . 
  they would be protected by an un-mission which at that time consisted of a dutch battalion : dutchbat . 
  when the attack started , the promised air support was absent , which made a good defense impossible . 
  dutchbat surrendered on the 11th of july . 
  ** compound ** at that time 20.000 to 30.000 civilians and combatants had sought refuge near the hq of dutchbat in potocari , vijf kilometer outside srebrenica . 
  on the terrain itself were 5000 refugees , including almost 350 men . 
  with the bosnian-serbs was decided that all refugees would be transported with busses to safe territory . 
  the troops of mladic were permitted to check weather there were men among them who had committed war-crimes . 
  in total the bosnian-serbs have killed over 7000 muslim men and boys . 
  among those were too men who tried to reach safety on their own . 
  oh i agree , politics really screwed up sending out dutchbat without proper equipment . 
  nato 's lack of air support was a big facor of this tragedy too . 
  i do understand the reasoning in this particular case , but disagree with the conclusion . 
  sure , we could have not sent those 350 men out of the compound , but we had already surrendered , it would n't have made a difference . 
  the cooperation with the evacuation was well intended , but a mistake . 
  also would n't have made a difference . 
  either way , the mess was caused by improper equipment , and politics that withheld air support .

  well , they do have separate police and separate laws ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrobz_hzzuc, 
  curious half-independent city-state within the uk ... does that also extend to building codes ? 
  who does ? 
  seriously , maybe belarus , moldova , and some caucasus semi-independent russian sponsored countries ? 
  good points , even if deployment would be bound to ` actions in defence of the european people ' you can ` trust ' politicians to twist that into suppressing country x for ` the defence of the rest ' or some other bullshit reason . 
  if we would restrict eu deployment to invitation from the local state only , you can expect the local state government to be overrun by foreign influence , so that call gets never made . 
  it 's a mess . 
   interestingly , it 's the exact opposite of the spectre of military under command of a sovereign state that is commonly raised by eu as its primary reason for existence . 
  could you please elaborate on that ? 
  what spectre ? 
  also , what eu aristocracy ? 
  every government has a bunch of officials which should be thrown into a fire . 
  i would expect any eu military deployment to require a large parliament majority . 
  venice is a lot like some parts of the netherlands . 
  it 's practically a collection of mud-banks that happen to be dry most of the time . 
  for dutchies , the only * true * option would be to lock down the venetian lagoon , and pump the water down to the desired level :p . 
  huh , interesting difference in experience/opinion of military deployment . 
  for me it 's nothing to worry about , knowing that the military is dedicated to protection and is subservient to the civilian government . 
  the option of a military regime is practically impossible in my view . 
  i mostly loath the ill-advised interventionist adventures of the past 25 years . 
  i take it you have less trustful experience with military 's . 
  i feel you . 
  there better be a 2/3 majority in the parliament needed for any eu army deployment outside of the eu, 
  the glacial pace of bureaucracy protects us from volatile politicians . 
  better hope the eu never needs to take decisive action :p . 
  either way , we are at a crossroads . 
  or we join forces , north pays south , and south accepts stricter monetary policy , or we separate in different currency zones . 
  different currency zones are n't that much of a hassle for the common man thanks to electronic payments , but for business it 'll be hell . 
  be sure to let them know at every possible opportunity of all your crazy parties , the wealth of money you can spend on your personal hobby 's , and automate a facebook status update every sunday at noon celebrating you are still lazy in bed . 
  those separate blocks are exactly the ` local deviations ' i mean . 
  either that , or actual separate currencies , which very few people want , so we got ta make the policy fix work , somehow . 
   no intent to deceit  government knew exactly what they were getting into  sell the idea to the public potato potato ? 
  what they did was indeed the most practical way of going about it , though it was n't a particular nice way .
