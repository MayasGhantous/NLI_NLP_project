  the risks were held back , and we all suffer from it . 
  i think the damage to the trust in the eu as institution is also a cost we should n't discount . 
  not fixing the policy will destroy the union for sure , through economics . 
  we need a unified policy which can take into account the need for local deviations of ` the norm ' . 
  ( which does carry the risk of creating a bureaucratic monstrosity ), 
  unfortunately . 
  though i do think it is partially perception , people do n't change that fast . 
  negative experiences tend to stick and be remembered better than positive ones . 
  there will * always * be * some * person who things this one particular thread is the perfect opportunity for some sarcastic hostile comment ( and ad hominem attacks ) , resulting in every thread having them . 
  ( i 'm not innocent either , though i do try to limit my sarcasm to the humor/shit-posting threads ) . 
  we will endure . 
  so , trick a few wildly different economies into linking together with a single currency . 
  wait 15 years for the whole mess to destabilise because separate policies with a single currency is a recipe for trouble . 
   more open to the idea of a common fiscal policy use the chaos as leverage . 
  i am very much pro-eu , but this is n't the way cooperation and unification should go . 
  we certainly should n't go back now , but * please * let us learn and not do this kind of thing again . 
  fun fact : i wrote a similar reaction 3 hours after you , yet i get net up-votes while you have been down-voted to hell . 
  pointing at another currency which happens to be more volatile at the moment does n't mean the eurozone does n't have some rather big problems . 
  a singe currency without a single fiscal policy was a bad idea . 
  we need to fix one of those two , preferable the policy . 
  too late , i know people younger than you with kids . 
  it scares me to , and i 'm 28 . 
  well , it worked !, 
   the purpose of the competition was to promote technical education does not compute . 
  terrace tax ... coffee ? 
  a few euro , np . 
  oh , you 're sitting on the terrace ? 
  no parks is a good point , the best you can hope for is a rooftop terrace , or a the deck of a boat in the grand canal . 
  the lack of sidewalks is n't that much of a problem , the entire road * is * the sidewalk . 
  it 's like a fantasy landscape . 
   the grauniad sounds like some kind of evil conspiracy propaganda organisation . 
  where can i apply for membership ? 
  not every city is suitable , but plenty are . 
  especially in dense urban regions bikes can be much faster ( and cheaper ) than cars . 
   you still ca n't call us '' \\*\\*\\* \\* ing \\*\\*\\* \\*\\* who should \\*\\*\\* \\* themselves '' darling loves who should hail themselves ^ ( as saviours of balanced discussion ) ? 
  if you build it , they will come . 
  i weep for turkeys future . 
  most of those with the courage to speak up against this idiocy have already done so , and have been purged from influential positions . 
  are there any sane people with influence left in turkey ? 
  it 'll take decades for turkey to recover from the destruction of the past few years . 
  current , as in ` now ' , they may change in the future . 
  is there an out of whack copyright section in this treaty ? 
  were the negotiations conducted any different ? 
  you dropped something , here it is : / s, 
  i 'm glad macron not just calls out the issue , but actually has constructive ideas how to improve the situation . 
  he also places the blame where it belongs , the current eastern european governments . 
  the ee workers also ` suffer ' under the current rules & policy . 
  he said * raise * wages , not make them equal . 
  but you are right that it would n't work on any reasonable time-scale . 
  satellite internet is great for remote areas . 
  though for most of us it is n't an attractive option due to the high latency . 
  this is n't for regular joe . 
  i bet they are all gulenists !, 
  / s i think it is an excellent form of protest, 
  i meant light orange/yellow as opposed to ( darker ) green shades . 
  i meant the citizens who protested assad 's government in the first place, 
  it depends on the situation , sometimes stability is preferable . 
  i do n't believe there can be stability as long as assad has any power though . 
  logic ? 
  * logic * ? 
  *** logic ? 
  *** how dare you use that on us !, 
  and if anyone seems to succeed , just switch sides !, 
  now you are on the winning team !, 
  except for the cringe-as-fuck pledge it works pretty well , 
  then why do you still have a foreign flair ? 
  * times 2 *, 
  would you believe it if clinton tells you he did n't ? 
  `` i did * not * have any relations with that man ! '', 
  stability with an authoritarian regime might in some cases be preferable to anarchy . 
  but what will happen to the people who resisted both assad and isis ? 
  assad wo n't embrace them , nor are those people likely to accept any authority from him . 
  i highly recommend watching all of their video 's, 
  i 'd say strait horizontal or vertical bars are more minimalist, 
  you can still use a light red colour ( orange/yellowish if you have to ), 
  within any political entity there will always be factions on the fringes of the spectrum . 
  would calling out such medieval influences help ? 
  especially if you put it in the perspective of general corruption when individuals , companies , and religious institutions attempt to meddle ? 
  i think marriage equality is a point of lesser importance on their agenda , so they do n't want to step on some toes . 
  tackle corruption first , that 's enough of a challenge . 
  with lesser corruption comes more wealth , with more wealth comes lesser ideological fanatics ( less need for tribal demagogues ), 
  any party or political movement around who wants to clean shit up ? 
  if you have sources for these quotes you 'll be king of / r/europe for a day, 
  if juncker is happy i 'm weary . 
  when the need rises you 'll figure it out  . 
  pop relocation and public transport is for when too many people live too far from their jobs . 
  cargo transport is the critical part to keep your economy going if for some reason international trade collapses ( and you 're stuck without oil ), 
  car 's for personal transport are n't the problem , if necessary you can relocate population , use electric trains , trams , and bikes . 
  cargo transport * is * critical . 
  you ca n't sustain industry if you ca n't move stuff with trucks . 
  geographic isolation ftw !, 
  assuming you folks can fulfil your own food , energy , and raw resource needs you 'll be the last bastion of civilization when the world goes to shit . 
  exactly, 
  it was happening , it was just more local . 
  terrorism goes with the times and becomes globalized . 
  edit : a word, 
  surely there is n't a ` real ' world outside of reddit ? 
  i 'm not advocating we stop buying anything from the us , i just believe a lot of the more ` basic ' stuff can be done ` at home ' . 
  next to the f35 we 'll can still use more ` regular ' craft . 
  ` we can use more independence ' would have been a better phrase .
