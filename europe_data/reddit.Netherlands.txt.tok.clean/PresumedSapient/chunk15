  not your mate , dude, 
  can , but not wise to do . 
  from its [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/famas ) : the famas uses a delayed blowback operating system that functions best with french-specified steel-casing 5.56 x45mm ammunition . 
  using standard brass-casing 5.56 \u00d7 45mm nato ammunition employed by other armies can create over-pressure and case ruptures in the famas , which can lead to severe malfunctions . 
  apparently there were still incompatibilities , something with nato using brass and the the french ammo using steel casing . 
  not your friend , buddy, 
  i wonder why ? 
  it 's shorter and easier to manage , while maintaining barrel length . 
  having the magazine at the shoulder might affect the reload speed ? 
  would that matter for modern infantry ? 
  edit : nvm , [ wikipedia lists the pros and cons pretty well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bullpup ) . 
  points i managed to extract from the article : * hk uses nato ammo * larger magazine ( 30 vs 25 ) , also compatible with the m4 * slightly lower rate of fire ( hk 700-900 vs famas 900-1100 ) * more reliable , easier to maintain , less parts * short hk version weights the same as the famas ( 3.7 kg ) , the long version is 4 kg * famas became too expensive to maintain now * why * they picked a german weapon i do n't know ( did n't france used to have a ` french only ' policy for military stuff ? ) . 
  i take it as a hopeful sign for better european cooperation and more efficient weapon & material purchases edit : a word, 
  partially . 
  we only go up to the dogger bank , north of that is a rather deep trench which is needed as drain for the baltic . 
  some interesting perspectives on economic and political priorities of russia . 
  by no means a complete picture , of course . 
  meh , we got the southern netherlands back  we 'll retake the north , nothing a few dikes and windmills ca n't fix . 
  fun side effect of collecting a few dozen kingdoms and principalities . 
  eventually every other royal house had to marry one of you . 
  i think we could make that work , 
  indeed, 
  it 's called ` peanutcheese ' for that reason in the netherlands . 
  wich is also stupid . 
  nailed it, 
  ` quoting ' or ` citing ' is the word you 're looking for, 
   lust for power and will to subjugate tongue in cheek poetry also : tlotr, 
  great for mid-late game steamrolling, 
  their loss, 
  nah , our dikes are clay , loam , sand , and basalt blocks . 
  nothing fancy like ` bricks ' . 
  are you accusing politicians of self-reflection ? 
  correct . 
  which begs the question what did they do all that time ? 
  art . 
  50 is the start sign of the negotiations , all that time before the trigger may could have selected her team and written down the opening proposals . 
  instead she called elections * after * the art . 
  50 trigger , wasting valuable time . 
  classical liberal favours more direct democracy . 
  directly elected mayors , more referenda , and more localized power through regional representatives, 
  if those new rules include religious criteria , you 'll be able to deny those luke-warm ` beer ' drinkers !, 
  collect them all ? 
  you still have freedom of movement , you 're free to go get that job !, 
  clearly they are using some better traffic mod . 
  if he can manage that , you fully deserve it . 
  it 'll teach the eu a lesson in pragmatism . 
  the un has no troops , it can only pass resolutions asking/permitting countries to act . 
  so it should have been individual countries to act with un blessing . 
  i think ` reactionary ' would be more fitting . 
  its actions have always been a response , not to instigate shit . 
  ( as far as i know ), 
  bad qa protocols during production , probably hired cheap programmers . 
  90 's yugoslav actions were un resolution enforcement , but it should n't have been nato to do it . 
  afganistan was ` technically ' article 5 response to an attack ( 9/11 ) . 
  politics are at play , unfortunately . 
  unfortunately : politics . 
  nato 's framework does unfortunately lend itself for abuse . 
  multiple countries agree * something * must be done , and the easiest way is through nato :( . 
  the yuguslav war monitor operations , and subsequent ~ ~ cluster-fuck ~ ~ interventions was to enforce united nations resolutions ( non nato countries ( even russia ) participated in the peace-keeping ) . 
  the whole mess just kept escalating during the 90 's . 
  i would never claim they were right , but they were n't wrong either . 
  not acting was n't morally acceptable either . 
  i do agree though , it should not have been nato to intervene . 
  individual cooperating countries with a un mandate would have been ` fine ' , but they should n't have dragged nato in to do it . 
  i just meant that even though they had comparative liberty compared to others , the people themselves often do not feel that way . 
  again , they only look at themselves compared to better places . 
  in this case , they were not fully independent , therefore they are ` oppressed ' , extremely simplified . 
  even though compared to other regions they enjoyed quite a few liberties . 
  oppressed people usually do n't compare themselves with people who have it even worse . 
  i mean `` we are oppressed !, 
  but at least not as bad as [ x ] '' does n't really work to rally support for change eh ? 
  could do with a bit of paint eh ? 
  / jk i love it when we are able to continue to use 2 millennia old structures . 
  are the acoustics still ok ? 
  you might want to provide a link for that offer , 
  i think it 's the red hair that gives you the * wow * factor , 
  oops , i mixed up/messed up my response to / leonjovanovic . 
  ah well , nevermind , 
  usually one elects representatives to some form of government . 
  those people can study the ins and outs of complicated problems , and hopefully make a choice with less emotional interference . 
  they have little other tools in international politics, 
  exactly . 
  the enforcement of a ` pax-nato ' reduces ( takes away ? 
  eventually ? ), 
  the threat of war as a political/economic tool . 
  some economic and political strategies are not able to function without those tools . 
  enforced peace certainly does n't solve everything , but it does encourage us to find better solutions than just ` blame [ x ] , kill [ x ] ' . 
  russia does ` lose ' a potential neutral harbour . 
  i think the outrage is more for internal news-narrative purposes , the usual ` everyone is conspiring against us ' . 
  while i agree with you on principles , i think the third point is a bit weak . 
  the big downside of mutually assured destruction as a peace-enforcing principle is that it relies on all parties acting rational . 
  do you trust the russian and us military & political systems to * always * put sufficiently rational people at the button ? 
  we have had [ plenty of close calls already ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nuclear_close_calls ), 
  joining a * defensive * pact is now considered a hostile act, 
  damn that is smart . 
  wipe out the radicals , and give way to individuals who can offer constructive criticism and opposition . 
  who did the research ? 
  you need some smart ( and trustworthy ) people to dig through a lot of local news and history to sort out which individuals are ` allowed to stay ' . 
  i assume they left the premises immediately ? 
  it does seem more like a / r/yurop post,
