  same here  . 
  every time the eu enforced maximum tarifs , i receive self-congratulatory emails and sms ' about how great [ provider ] is . 
  you should go read the children 's stories as collected and written by the brothers grimm . 
  why should we censor death out of children 's tales ? 
  saudia arabia , yemen , mauritania , sudan , iraq , iran , afganistan , pakistan . 
  i 'd prefer we do n't . 
  i very much enjoyed my the quiet 2016 summer . 
  ssshhhh ... you 're breaking a carefully crafted illusion of ancestral purity . 
  i think he means you lot are mud-bloods with invasive french/norman ancestry . 
  not unexpected , considering the size of the area :( . 
  anarchy is kinda liberating ... 
  be aware : de spelt is our equivalent of the onion . 
  just making fun of theresa ` no-snap-elections ' may . 
  about half of the article i linked is about how painful this is for the families . 
  they were promised the ground was sifted . 
  obviously the research team did n't plow through all the fields ans forests . 
  that fool was bragging about it on facebook , and wondering wether he should/would give it to the police ( including the human remains ) . 
  he was having fucking poll on twitter . 
  he was asked to give the stuff to the investigation , but then he tried to smuggle it through customs ( he let another passenger check in the bag ) . 
  he refused to help the investigation to find the exact spot he found the bone fragment , so they seized his camera equipment . 
  what did you expect ? 
  til what to do when i get my time machine working, 
  well , you are a federation right ? 
  the glorious ~ ~ invasion ~ ~ revolution from 1688 did n't work out for us because the english economy dominated the union . 
  we 'll see about that now that we have the eu to back us . 
  ~ ~ its the metre by meridional definition . ~ ~ ~ ~ the pendulum definition was never accepted ( it was only a proposal ) since they quickly found out that gravity is n't uniform . ~ ~ the pendulum definition was only used less than a year ( may 1790 to march 1791 ) . 
  so i do n't know . 
  i guess it depends how fast they came up with the idea to make and spread these public standards ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metre#history_of_definition edit : correction, 
  simple and effective way to communicate a standard measurement to the unlettered masses , 
  so you should , meter is dirty colonial ( american ) spelling . 
  metre is still the uk spelling . 
  though meter is ` more correct ' considering the pronunciation ( say ` tre ' ... ` me-tre ' ... bah ), 
  why not ? 
  it 's the best unit for construction if you want to prevent conversion or decimal errors . 
  interesting , in the netherlands we do n't use it at all . 
  foodstuffs are measured in grams , even if goes in the hundreds ( 200 g ham , 500 g rice , etc ), 
  makes you wonder , what if your prince george and our princess amalia would ... you know ... fancy one another ? 
  how would that work out ? 
  maybe we can arrange something ? 
  just forget about the 10 year age difference , we should n't let such triviality stand in the way of ~ ~ power ~ ~ true love . 
  definitely no snap elections !, 
  nope , she 's definitely a lizard . 
  most of the thing was built by hand . 
  people with wheelbarrows tossing clay into the sea . 
  a battle won , though the war will never end . 
  i think you are over-estimating the power of the '45 nukes . 
  yes , the destruction would be horrible , and the fallout would ruin quite a bit of land , but not * that * much . 
  a ` fat man ' a-bomb on munich [ would n't affect the swiss/french/chech in any way ] ( https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&amp;kt=20&amp;lat=48.1351253&amp;lng=11.5819806&amp;hob_opt=2&amp;hob_psi=5&amp;hob_ft=1650&amp;fallout=1&amp;zm=12 ) . 
  maybe some higher cancer rates , depending on the wind direction . 
  i hear there are some greeks looking for work ... 
  again ? 
  lets invite some people to fill the gaps ? 
  its a bit blunt ... 
  i think political critique works better when its razor sharp and politely worded . 
  though that might be a cultural thing . 
  economic ** inter ** dependency then , it does go both ways . 
  you guys forgot to fix the swastika shadow ... :p, 
  sounds like a good book title !, 
  we should n't deny our history , lest we forget it . 
  it was an attempt at originality , something different than ` swamp-german ' given the quantity economic discussions some time back , i thought to poke fun of our economic dependency on our german bro 's . 
  thank you for telling , glad i at least triggered * somebody * :p, 
  probably some eu exchange program , 
  this is n't crying wolf though . 
  it 's a censorship check . 
  if you ca n't make fun of authority , it must be replaced . 
  the kind rulers of / r/europe have passed the test , so they can stay ... for now . 
  this one might be a bit too subtle for me . 
  holy crap , the 1944-45 bombing is like a candle compared to that burn . 
  apply marshall-plan to burnt area ? 
  you misspelled ` slovakia ', 
  both cities have their charm  . 
  though i prefer rotterdam to live in as well . 
  i would n't like spending too much time in a tourist-trap open-air-museum :p \\* * dives into hiding away from the locals * \\*, 
  amsterdam city centre was designed and built in a time when 4-5 floors were about the limit . 
  ( probably safety regulations ) . 
  the colours & styles were rather limited ( 17th and 18th century ) . 
  rotterdam however ... it was bombed into oblivion in wwii [ ( google image search ) ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=rotterdam+ww2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi--_fpi5xuahwgjfakhbkgdoqq_auicigb&amp;biw=1349&amp;bih=954 ) . 
  post war architects and city planners were given a lot of freedom to build their ideal city . 
  it 's just a trick from our government to let you pay for our fleet . 
  in exchange you can pretend to have a fleet , 
   enslaving people you mean ` manual-persuasive delegation ' ? 
  it was tradition !, 
  maybe because it is n't navy ? 
  according to the article you linked its owned by the ` french southern and antarctic lands administration ' . 
  this would be a major ~ ~ tourist ~ ~ attraction ... ** un ** like the catacombs underneath the vatican ( those are booked a year in advance ) . 
  but for urban explorers ... ~ ~ where can i sign up ? ~ ~ edit : strikethrough , this is definitely not for tourists , and not something for people to sign up for, 
  ok , lets see how many toes we can step on , or tropes we can confirm/deny ... ( all based on a single simple non-nuanced metric and offensive regional stereo-types , of course ) * esti can into nordic ? 
  * belgium is slacking , i bet it 's the walloons . 
  surely our flemish bro 's work hard ? ), 
  * portugal may have an inefficiency problem ( corruption ? 
  they seem to work hard enough ... ) * northern italy is doing a ` belgium ' and is being dragged down by the south * poland , croatia and hungary are doing the smart thing , they sent their people to earn more money in western europe , and then go back relaxing at home . 
  * romania & bulgaria : the nice thing would be to say they do the same trick as poland . 
  the rude thing would be to say stealing is counted as a hobby , and not counted towards ` working years ' * greece ... pay debt !, 
  \\* * swings whip * \\*, 
  our fishing boats ` catch ' bones ( and bone fragments ) quite often ... 
  sometimes even stone tools or pieces of pottery . 
  otherwise , it 's a dark , 50 m deep sea with muddy floor . 
  edit : everything i read about it indicates that during this time period it was either glaijers or tundra . 
  very little in the way of civilization , save some hunter-gatherer tribes . 
  edit 2 : some work is being done !,
