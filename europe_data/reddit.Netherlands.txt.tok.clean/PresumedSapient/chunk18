  without them reverting to ` unwanted ' television , news-papers , or even having ` too much contact ' with their families back in ` where-ever-they-came-from ' . 
  you need to effectively ` bully ' people out of their comfort-zone , tire them out with exposure your desired system ( which i 'm sure , many people have different opinions of what exactly the desired system is ) . 
  you must ` cuddle them to exhaustion ' , to force them to adapt , or leave . 
  i completely agree though , it must be done . 
  but their are ** a lot ** of ethical thorns and obstacles . 
  they are working on it though !, 
  lots of development in the eastern regions of the country , lands which for some strange reason have been ` abandoned ' by the native population ... edit : / s , because people ca n't read sarcasm , my bad . 
  bankers ? 
  i see a new challenge !, 
  i present you , the dutch police , dancing on kings day ( last week ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaesfppk9dk, 
  no deal - wto regulations will be bad for us all . 
  please do n't let your business sense be clouded by politically motivated artificial nationalism . 
  i hope the negotiators will have enough sense ( and political freedom ) to work out a fair and polite split . 
  clickbait and sensationalist media throwing around unsubstantiated numbers are n't helping . 
  agreed . 
  they are burning bridges though . 
  exactly . 
  i did n't say they did n't answer , i just hope we 'll find better answers than this ` pragmatic ' ( hypocrisy ) approach . 
  depends on the language and subject . 
  english wikipedia is great for science/technology/math explanations and referrals . 
  especially politics and history ( which should only describe events ) are hit-or-miss . 
  you talked about it on twitter ? 
  careful ... you 're on erdo 's list now ... 
  i wish the international community had a functional answer to these ` stable autocracies ' . 
  if we condemn the autocrats we contribute to messy economic and social conflicts with lots of innocent casualties . 
  which still has a very real possibility of helping the next extremist/populist/autocrat-in-training to power . 
  if we do n't condemn them , we indirectly support rotten regimes for the sake of postponing the aforementioned messy situation . 
  how to find a balance between pragmatism/hypocrisy ( for ` stability ' ) , and being true to our values ( without possibly inciting civil war/crackdowns/etc . ) ? 
  and of course , oversimplifications like i just made are no where near capable of accurately describing the thousand-and-one unique situations . 
   i did n't even know people in europe actually slaughter animals . 
  we eat meat , so yes we slaughter animals . 
  this mostly concerns meat for consumption , not religious offers . 
  they wo n't . 
  enjoy your ~ 18 months of eu roaming . 
  after that ... it depends on what kind of deal the brexit will be . 
  for example iceland , norway and lichtenstein are in , but switzerland is n't . 
  he / u/blueson , i think we can agree this guy is just mashing his keyboard . 
  this ca n't be an actual language right ? 
  documents written by politicians i should hope ? 
  surely ` real ' reports by civil servants ( not politicians ) use more policy neutral wording ... 
  i want to believe ... 
  please allow me to have hope ... * sniffle *, 
  it reads as a political opinion magazine , not a summary of current affairs & statistics by a government security agency . 
  / u/glideer below has a similar opinion , but he wrote it a rather blunt way and was thus down-voted to oblivion , i 'm attempting to use a bit more tact . 
  those are very valid points . 
  i can only assume ( based on history ) there are very few ( if any ) innocent parties in complex and highly charged processes as these . 
  ( except for the ` general population ' , who are always the victim ) . 
  as oblivious western-european i have little right to argue for either side due simple lack of in-depth knowledge . 
  how dare you pretending to be a unique culture with your own traditions , history and language !, 
  are * australians ** are ** into europe  . 
  it goes the other way ` round as well !, 
  nope , had n't seen the strike-through yet . 
  just a general case of forum mismatch due to reading multiple tabs and slow typing ( i.e. 
  rewriting & rephrasing a lot ) . 
  kicking the other people down is easier than lifting oneself up . 
  how are you not treated as a full member ? 
  the uk will continue to receive eu funds for as long as it is a member . 
  whats happening now is that there was an internal ` reminder memo ' concerning the fact that there is a ` legal requirement for a contracting party to be established in the eu for the duration of the contract ' . 
  this is not something new , this was known . 
  and the eu is polite enough to ` call on eu staff to begin encouraging the uk-based private sector to prepare ' . 
  if those private sector parties have an eu based division there is nothing to worry about . 
  you are n't loosing any money now , you are only loosing * potential * money which has a legal requirement to be spend on companies established in the eu , which you are leaving . 
  i 've seen very little outright hatred , and it usually gets down-voted to hell quite fast . 
  i do agree some folks express far too much glee whenever some brexit-related downside is highlighted . 
  it is quite immature and does n't contribute . 
  the thread you are responding now however , is not one of those . 
  the eu like many other political entities has a ` internal market first ' policy for subcontractors . 
  it is only logical that any such new long term contracts exclude companies that will not be based in the eu by the time the contract is signed or goes into effect . 
  they have a very nice flag !, 
  there is just ^ this ^ little ^ smudge ... also : great weather , beautiful country , contested ` ownership ' of nicola tesla 's legacy . 
  before they joined the eu party they also had some border guards who looked at me with very serious eyes ... ( which was a new experience for a kid with only post-schengen experiences like i was at the time ), 
  newton , pascal , kelvin , watt ... tesla ... bell ... ( though both lesser known among the general public :( ) i find it a great way to honour the great minds of the past . 
  seems like you succeeded well enough in the language department :d . butchering the dutch language is a national past-time . 
  mixing in german/english with horrible mispronunciations too . 
  i should think it depends on the time-frame of the contract . 
  a contract for something short term like keeping the eu bureaucrats office 's pantry stocked next year should n't be affected . 
  anything longer term ( 5 + year ? ), 
  however , is entirely fair game . 
  i 'm sure you would n't want the uk government , when freed from the eu overlords , to be unnecessarily tied to some external entity either ? 
  i am assuming the eu has a policy of not outsourcing service contracts to non-eu companies . 
  at least not unless it concerns a product with very specific demands and there is no viable eu based alternative . 
  ( we do n't have a eu based alternative for ms windows , for example ) . 
  you ca n't have two different sets of rules be valid at the same time . 
  as long as you are part of the eu single market , you play by the rules of the eu trade deals ( as do we all ) . 
  you are strongly encouraged to make new deals , though they will probably include a section stating something along the lines of ` this deal will come into effect the day the uk is no longer bound by earlier supra-national agreements governing trade deals ( such as an eu membership ) ' . 
  if you link ` far-right ' economics with liberalism , where would you fit in anarchy ? 
  in the netherlands , our ` far-right ' ( which is still relative centre-right ) , has extremely leftist economic ideas ( unchecked handouts for anyone old , or anyone lacking any sense for realistic achievable policy ) . 
  the old left-right political spectrum can no longer be applied to current politics . 
  ` liberal-conservative ' definitions have been mangled by us politics . 
  most mid-20th century ideologies are associated with half a dozen mis-applied or mis-interpreted policies . 
  extreme over-simplification of complex systems to suit certain political or media agenda 's is n't helping any of this . 
  bottom line : any constructive political discussion is horribly handicapped by our current lack of a unified spectrum/label system . 
  then you would have 50 % !, 
  a dark day for europe . 
  i found some video of the first strike , aimed at the bridge , and unfortunately hit the train : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6zkeugspco ) . 
  and the second strike , which should not have happened , had the pilot recognised the train ( which is a major source of disagreement ) : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4s09ddbdb4 ) . 
  edit : tread carefully on youtube , the comments are carcinogenic . 
  humour vilification is the end of constructive discussion . 
  thus we counter with the ancient tradition of ridicule  edit : typo, 
  in case you have n't graduated yet , this might be an interesting angle to look into the politics of your science education .
