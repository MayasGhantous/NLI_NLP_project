  or pretty much any country north of the alps :( . 
  we really need to get solar powered desalination plants going if we 're going to support all these populations in dry and drying climates ... or when we get rid of our oil addiction , maybe reuse those oil pipelines and start selling the middle east water ? 
  how naughty !, 
  [ agriculture mostly ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=flevoland&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewja5ot1lqxvahujmbqkhycnbdyq_auicigb&amp;biw=1107&amp;bih=954#tbm=isch&amp;q=flevoland+luchtfoto ) . 
  and the south-west corner is used as ` overflow ' for population from amsterdam . 
  it 's slightly different coloured in google maps because it has relatively more agriculture than animal husbandry ( which would need more grass ) . 
  the trick is not trying to fill it , but to drain it . 
  or they did a longer channel/pipeline to the nile and fill it with fresh water ? 
  like the dead sea , it 'll turn saline eventually , though like you say we can pump it out to keep it fresh . 
  it would be the cost of having a rather large area of useful land in stead of desert . 
  also pretty stupid , it would destroy the current climate . 
  the eastern half of europe would become a desert . 
  we 're turning it into a sustainable pelt business . 
  100 % accurate . 
  all true dutchman do this at least once a year . 
  huh , pretty obvious :p needs one more syllable in the first half though, 
  how about : * the tide is ruled by thee , * * the moon , the wind , and we *, 
  \\* assuming you get to be one of the few who are born in a wealthy family . 
  ** and do n't die by some horrible disease before you turn 6 *** and do n't mind living in a world in which a little infected scratch may spell your death **** or mind having to fight for your life if you live anywhere else but a few ` safe ' zones . 
  ***** safe because nobody cares about them , which kinda excludes the whole ` wealthy family ' thing . 
  no thanks , current day west europe/north america is the best place to be born in history . 
  unprecedented social mobility and available knowledge . 
  swamp was n't worth the effort, 
  rough translation : ~ ~ * here who rule the tide , * ~ ~ * the tide is ruled by thee , * * the moon , the wind , and we . 
  * edit : fixed rhyme, 
  no , it 's : orthodox - all patriarchs are equal !, 
  catholic - we control rome , so our patriarch ( the pope ) is best !, 
  protestant - fuck the patriarchy !, 
  heavy rains caused drains and ( mixed ) sewers to flood , which was was dumped into the channels through over-flows ? 
  there should be , but it 'll be tricky to convince politicians to vote for a ` tax ' specifically for them and their friends . 
  distribution chain . 
  if the distribution centers all sell the same ~ ~ b-grade ~ ~ ` ee-flavour ' version of a product eastern european shops and and consumers have little chance to ` vote with their wallet ' . 
  germany : `` you should consider doing x. '', 
  nationalists : '' * reeeeee !!!, 
  nazi 's ! '', 
  germany : `` i 'll let you do whatever you want . '', 
  federalists : `` reeeeee !!!, 
  take responsibility as major economic power ! '', 
  our liberal consevative parties do n't want to fix it 'cause they are buddies with the rich . 
  our ` social ' parties do n't want to fix it 'cause they fear it 'll force them to make unpopular budget cuts if we miss out on that little trickle of tax money these fake companies bring in . 
  we need a eu-synchronisation so that businesses get taxed in the country they do business in . 
  members will still be able to set any tariff they like , but companies should be forbidden from letting their profits be taxed elsewhere . 
  to prevent large inequalities due to different sales taxes , we probably should restrict such taxes within a eu wide range ( maybe even different ranges depending on economic development , allowing ee more flexibility to attract business ) . 
  as long they did n't lie on the product packaging , i do n't see on what grounds we could fine them . 
  maybe abuse of the semi-monopolistic position of the established distribution chains ? 
   and politicians need their fix i 'd figure politicians are net * producers * of bullshit, 
  the big downside of such soft power is that it is not completely transparant for the people ( on either side ) . 
  if the polish government has enough influence in the media the people will never know , or be told the eu is trying to take their sovereignty . 
  other eu peoples ca n't see the power and influence being applied , and thus continue seeing the eu as a ` powerless ' bureaucratic load . 
  and even politicians from poland might not completely realise that they are being punished ( the higher echelons might lie to them about what is happening ) , let even fully know how and why ( unless someone explicitly tells them ) . 
  bottom line , the power is real , but it should be very clear and transparant for it to actually work . 
  punishing by ` mistakenly ' not informing their diplomats or ignoring their envoys is simply rude and can easily be twisted into something else . 
   except that is completely wrong . 
  i would never accuse public opinion or politicians of being completely right :p i 'm sure ariane 6 is a good rocket for the next decade ( s ? 
  ) , i was just speculating on ` what if 's ' , because reusable spaceflight is intriguing . 
  and only noting that many people ( with influence , and not necessarily burdened with understanding ) * will * see it as a competition . 
  you 're saying we have a chance ? 
  my traumatised brain is afraid to nurture hope ... , 
   maybe you should stop using terminology of fields you do n't understand . 
  too late . 
  i 'm a physics student , and i agree with you on the entire quantum thing and the reasons why skylon is just dreams in the minds of laymen , *** but *** the ` quantum ' thing has already been hijacked by politics and popular science slogans . 
  the ` big paradigm shift ' meaning has established itself in the language , unfortunately . 
  we lost that battle already . 
  i agree that spacex is overrated , thats why i said '' *** if *** spacex 's approach is on the mark '' the ( medium educated ) public , many politicians , and even some people in the rocketry business too , will look at the ` ariane 6 vs falcon 9 ' competition as ` old-school-thinking with current tech ' vs ` new-school-thinking with current tech ' . 
  the design approach is very different , spacex has demonstrated a much more ` gung-ho ' style of design . 
  changes which would take ariane space years to design , test and implement are being thrown into production & live testing far faster . 
  both approaches have good reasons . 
  the ` quick and dirty ' approach is more effective at producing quick results ( for a cost ) . 
  the ` traditional ' approach was born out of traumatising accidents and years of experience . 
  the helium tank redesign which led to that exploded rocket being a fine example . 
  people will compare not just technology , but schools of thought on rocket design . 
  tolerate more explosions for faster design iterations ? 
  and *** if *** the re-usability thing works out with spacex 's current approach , others will want to replicate that . 
  might not as bad as people make it sound to be . 
  it will depend on whether turkey will break away from nato/western ( non-russian influence ) europe , or if the current troubles are temporary . 
  they buy the tech , and having a nato member have a look in the ` russian kitchen ' for missile tech * can * benefit us all . 
  * best case scenario for nato is turkey gets the tech , and then says goodbye and thanks for tech to russia . 
  * medium good case is turkey does n't break away , but looses money and does n't get the tech the moment russia realises that * worst case is turkey * is * breaking away , and this is an indicator people 10 years later will point at and say `` see !, 
  we could have seen this coming ! '', 
  having your own ( not dependent on american or russian ) launch vehicle is important , but this is a private venture too . 
  it needs to be able to pay for itself through commercial launches . 
  i 'll be interesting to see how it 'll perform in competition with spacex in the coming decade . 
  lv development takes time , * if * spacex 's approach is on the mark , arianespace has some catching up to do . 
  especially ocean crossings do n't really need humans . 
  use a human harbour stationed crew & pilot for the coastal/harbour approach and departure , and let it go on triple redundant gps/galileo/whatevs across the big blue . 
  the protestants i knew and know regard any worship beside god idolatry ( including placing statues in churches ) . 
  the reasoning goes something like this :  the apostles and mary have no ` true ' role in the core of christianity whatsoever ( god , sins , salvation 'n stuff ) . 
  they were just messengers and a path into the material world from heaven . 
  though , that interpretation ~ ~ might ~ ~ probably depends on the flavour of christianity . 
  still , the french and the irish might want to sell/buy from each other , without the brits . 
  and as i said , more connections makes load balancing easier . 
  the point being the line is n't ` unneeded ' . 
  multiple connections are really useful for shifting energy around with fluctuation production and demand . 
  also , transport through the uk would mean transformation to ac which has more power loss with such great power capacities . 
  ( dc is great for electronics & batteries , ac for medium high power up to a few tens of kv , and for super high power we 're using dc again ), 
  too much statues !, 
  apparently they take great care not to damage the [ phellogen ( living part of the bark ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cork_cambium ), 
  most ` everywhere ' does n't have cork trees . 
  so this process is unknown for many . 
  we are used to artificial cork or alternative ways to close bottles .
