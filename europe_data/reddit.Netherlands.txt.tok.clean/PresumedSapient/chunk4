  wait what ? 
  no offence meant , but is using mules more economic than motorised vehicles ? 
  or is a matter of tradition that miraculously survived ? 
  i know wood cutters in steep mountain/hill regions still use horses to transport trees , because no vehicle can travel through those steep forests . 
  are many cork trees so difficult to reach that a small truck is more cumbersome than advantageous ? 
  i wonder if you 'll get pm 's from people asking permission to peel it . 
  is a single tree worth the money ? 
  $ 50 worth of cork for two people plus transportation does n't seem that much . 
  do the trees continue to live ? 
  i 'm curious to know how would you would classify it as propaganda ? 
  as far i can see it 's a factual summary of eu history and how it works . 
  the only slide with a ` message ' is the third one which has the ` never again war ' message , which was a major motivation for european cooperation and a nice kick-off for the presentation . 
  and the romans used slices of such pillars as road surface , 
  if we go back far enough we 're all part of the roman empire . 
  you mean the netherlands ? 
   the orange order founded 1795 -- brotherhood sworn to defend the protestant monarchy . 
  its name is a tribute to william of orange . 
  our william invaded england and kicked out the catholic king ( propaganda name ` glorious revolution ' , we did n't want to break your ` never successfully invaded ' since the normans streak ) . 
  those orangemen are pro-unity , stronger together ... to protect that protestant monarchy !, 
  we have a protestant monarchy !, 
  we could * reunite * !, 
  belgians are mostly catholic . 
  i fear i do n't have the power to do that ... but you do !, 
  how about the scottish people reject the rule of house windsor , and swear fealty to the house of orange-nassau ? 
  you 'd get to stay in the eu !, 
  we already have multiple countries within the kingdom of the netherlands , so you 'd get to be independent with your own laws and budget 'n stuff . 
  scottish and dutch friendship goes * way * back , we both share a history with the english , and we both dislike wasting money . 
  we 'd finally have a source of stone to build monuments , and you 'd get the +3 food , +2 gold and +1 productivity bonus when we polder some of those highland marshes . 
  ` old fart marrying young chick ' kind of criticism . 
  which is kinda clich\u00e9 . 
  older ladies taking younger lovers is clich\u00e9 too , though usually the lady is rich and they guy is just a pretty boy-toy . 
  mrs. macron caught herself a * powerful * boy-toy :p, 
  more like : we have an abundance of cities and towns with centuries worth of events and considerations clogging up the urban planning . 
  only the few places that got bombed to oblivion in ww2 , or were build out of nothing , have 20th century road layouts, 
  i 've never seen it before . 
  is it new ? 
  shit , i saw a similar post passing by ( the day before ? ), 
  yesterday , and though ` meh , regional something is happening post ' . 
  turns out you guys are pulling a ` portugal ' . 
  casualties ? 
  are you receiving support from other firefighters from slovenia/bosnia/albania ? 
  not selling , kids are too young to have enough cash . 
  free samples would be more likely . 
  / s or he 's just family or a friend ? 
  you know , that might be possible ? 
   court case in the netherlands gains some track and that it also takes on putin and other decision makers responsible nah , crucial witnesses are ` lost ' , the original raw radar data is ` lost ' . 
  russia would never release or make available materials that would proof it lied . 
  ***** this 'll be a public ` everyone knows who did it ' with plenty of misleading information on the web to allow the other side to continue to believe whatever they prefer to believe . 
  we have a pretty good idea how and from where mh17 was shot , but at best we can hope to identify the soldiers who were involved . 
  they 're probably no longer anywhere near ukraine . 
  the lines towards putin & co. are too long . 
  even if we find undeniable proof he personally ordered troops across the border to incite/assist the rebellion , linking that to personal responsibility of shooting mh17 is unlikely to happen . 
  and prosecution is even less likely , ` russia was protecting russians in ukraine , mh17 should n't have been flying in a warzone ' . 
  nobody is going to send putin in chains to the hague . 
  ***** eu and russian relations is screwed for decades to come though . 
  the entirety of the russian people will suffer under economic sanctions because their government never joined us in the 21th century and could n't find any other way than violence to compensate their perceived national interests ( perceived , because they screwed themselves royally ) . 
  it 's sad and frustrating . 
  then stop hugging asia !, 
  maybe put up some sails and move a bit further west ? 
  only the past week . 
  we had weeks without a drop before that . 
  especially farmers were getting * very * worried . 
  also , heavy rain after drought is bad too . 
  dried out earth ca n't absorb it and it only flushes away the nutrient rich top soil without re-hydrating the deeper layers, 
  well , i would n't have known  stop intercepting our rain !, 
  let some pass to the continent !, 
   every fucking part of the body that had wrinkles on it -- almost -- i feel oddly motivated to send a ~ ~ retinal ~ ~ rectal and scrotum scan to the tsa . 
  oh no , this sub is pretty realistic and pragmatic . 
  just when the thread is young , or certain other sub-reddits get to know of its existence , there might be a few unsubstantiated rants floating up . 
  do you claim exclusive use of that text ? 
  i 'd like to use it as copypasta ... 
  did n't you get the memo ? 
  germany somehow rules the eu since ... 
  i dunno ... a few months back ? 
  the bloody annoying issue with that is if germany is pro-active , it gets accused for being too dominant ( * reeee nazis ! * ) . 
  and if you ` support from the side ' you get smacked for not taking responsibility while being a ( relative ) dominant political and economic power . 
  do n't forget to thank / u/teskje for the karma :p https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nreha/raisedrelief_map_of_western_europe_with_a_touch/dkbnic2/, 
  finnish actually . 
  and they seek solace in alcohol . 
  like always : dikes and ~ ~ windmills ~ ~ ~ ~ steam-powered ~ ~ pumps !, 
  silly man , if you made that a second post you could have harvest double the karma !, 
  \\* * whooosh * \\*, 
  with exaggerated relief spain , portugal , and france have * no * flat land at all . 
  and the italian po-valley is about as flat as the netherlands ( which is clearly not * entirely * flat , the veluwe area is hilly ) . 
  it 's also nice to see how expansive the norwegian relief is . 
  driving in the alps has some fun parts , but you stick mostly to long valleys . 
  driving in norway is like a * vast * region of only interesting & fun parts :d, 
  it 's not the data that is biased , its the presentation and the attached message . 
  look up what happened with east germany when they exchanged the east-mark 1-to-1 with the west-mark . 
  the eastern economy collapsed pretty much instantly . 
  raising wages is a slow process , and must not be rushed . 
  it needs to go hand in hand with infrastructure improvements . 
  look at [ this post about the eu road system ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6g2e31/the_current_state_of_the_european_motorway_system/ ) , there is a lot of work to be done before the eastern economy can compete on a level footing . 
  the solution is not to simply ` raise wages ' , but to improve your overall infrastructure . 
  we 'll get there , but this is n't something we can \\* * poof * \\* fix in 1 , 5 or even 10 years . 
  plenty , and they applied stubbornness with glee . 
  however , they were also pragmatic , and when stubbornness stands in the way between you and your family being set for life ( and no puppies die ) they would sell their family farm . 
  bloody know which battles you should fight . 
  it actually is , plenty of people got to stay because they no longer spoke their original language and would be completely lost in whatever country they and their parents came from . 
  those cases were all because of way to long drawn out asylum procedures , but i bet they 'll try to use it .
