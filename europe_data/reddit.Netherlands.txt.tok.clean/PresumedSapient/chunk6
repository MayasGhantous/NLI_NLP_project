   poland was hardly innocent in the whole affair either . 
  they were definitely innocent . 
  just naive to think shit would n't go down that quickly . 
  i never understood why a pretend-democracy would use such impossible numbers . 
  everyone * knows * its made up !, 
  if they had said 82 % turnout and 92 % pro-government they 'd have at least the impression of legitimacy . 
  it 's real . 
  the day after the g20 conference he was walking through the city wearing jeans & sneakers , carrying a cup of coffee on his way to the formation negotiations for the new government . 
  no security , and nobody gave a damn . 
  dense population makes cycling and walking perfectly fine methods of transportation . 
  and the netherlands is usually pretty relaxed with its politicians . 
  against some terrorists , sure . 
  you also want to have something that can go up against a more technological up to date opponent . 
  manned fighters will have use for some time . 
  eventually both drones and fighters will become outdated . 
  modern multi-band radar can penetrate stealth , and surface-to-air missiles can fly * way * faster than any jet or drone . 
  i think vehicle based radars with aa ( defence ) and cruise missiles ( offence ) will dominate . 
  no more hiding files in cakes :(, 
  thank you for posting this !, 
  also a great example how education is key to unlock prosperity . 
  i 've always been a bit jealous of norway for having wisely managed their oil profits . 
  the netherlands unfortunately went on a ` spending spree ' without thinking ahead at all . 
  too bad none of the later governments ever dared fixing it . 
  now it 's too late , gas profits are going down , and we have n't even saved up money to deal with the earthquakes the industry caused . 
  we are n't there yet , we 'll be using manned craft for a few more decades . 
  unmanned craft can also be jammed , unless you make them fully autonomous , and that is n't going to happen soon either . 
  i do n't know why a tank manual has titties in it , but i agree with whoever came up with the idea . 
  i also do n't know why anyone found it necessary to explain the breaking distance of a grenade . 
  the obligation was temporary . 
  taking care/watching after incarcerated people is expensive and therefore better done at more centralised locations . 
  the country is densely populated , so a bigger station with such facilities is probably less than a 30 minute drive away . 
  and this is a tiny village , there wo n't be a regular influx of arrests like what happens in cities . 
  due to its border situation this ` station ' is more an administrative ` service desk ' and a communication link between both police forces . 
  why not remove all sub-reddits too ? 
  reddit.com/r/* why bother with seperate threads at all ?? 
  reddit.com/r/\\*/\\* does there need to be a seperation between thread and user ? 
  reddit.com/\\*/\\*/\\* lets be done with this www . * . 
  * / * / * / * edit : flooding / r/europe with ' x of europe ' shit-posts once in a while is a cultural tradition !, 
  we will not let you evil bureaucrats destroy our cultural identity and heritage !, 
  spain and not-spain :p, 
  it probably did rain , but it evaporated again before reaching the ground :(, 
  cooked brains make bad decisions ? 
  the obligation was temporary , i edited my previous comment , but you responded * too fast * . 
  must be because reddit is n't throttled :p, 
  then it downloads the installer file and installs firefox . 
  it looks like [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/postimages/15741/microsoftbrowserchoice.png ) the ` browser pick screen ' is just a bare-bones ( ie ) browser with a single purpose . 
  though for some reason ms did n't offer it with windows 10 . 
  edit : the obligation to offer a choice was temporary , the moment it expired ms stopped offering it . 
  [ [ source ] ] ( https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2019411/information-about-the-browser-choice-update-for-system-administrators ), 
  they offer you a screen with the question : `` which browser would you like to use ? '', 
  and you get to pick between the top 5 browsers in random order . 
  manually putting an installer file on a usb stick would be the alternative i guess . 
  in my village the police was housed within the community centre . 
  small village , a little office space is all that the police needs . 
  police does n't really need imposing architecture . 
  it 's more like a ` service desk ' than a full blown police station . 
  as long as the alternative is visible on the document you wo n't get into ( too much ) trouble with some of the more strict border guards . 
  letter c and q and x are pretty useless here too . 
  * c is pronounced as an s or k * q can be replaced by k or ku * x can be replaced by ks, 
  your ancestors made do with just 24 runes in the 5th century !, 
  stop making up new letters !, 
  at 11:50 , in case anyone does n't have the time to watch the whole thing . 
  ( that video should be the base of high-school history education ), 
  and they became more vulnerable because of the lower percentage of resistant population . 
  other regions had been ` culled ' before . 
  managing to evade/reduce one wave does n't make much of a difference if you do n't understand disease and immunology like we do now . 
   one serving woman , strutting about in here mistress 's finery fine example of one of the after effects . 
  medieval serfdom broke down , individual liberties and opportunities rose  . 
  if/when \u00df is removed it will be . 
  ca n't you argue it limits your ability for international communication ? 
  i can imagine this kind of thing can lead to a lot of trouble at borders , or like you said : ( foreign ) banking systems give you trouble . 
  it effectively limits your freedom within the eu ... 
  sports fans v.s. 
  the practicalities of reality ... \\* * shudder * \\*, 
  switch to ` ss ' ? 
  names have changed spelling throughout history , it would be a normal part of alphabet streamlining . 
  can we please take that ... * thing * out of the german alphabet ? 
  a double s works fine , and it 'll allow you to switch to more universal keyboards . 
  why do \u00f6 and \u00e4 even need their own keys ? 
  any ` letter + decoration accent ' can be made easily just as \u00e0\u00e1\u00e4\u00e2\u00e3\u00e8\u00e9\u00eb\u00ea\u00f2\u00f3\u00f6\u00f4\u00f5\u00f9\u00fa\u00fc\u00fb\u00ec\u00ed\u00ef\u00ee\u00e7\u00f1 by preceding the letter with ' ` '' ^ or ~ , why waste more keys on them ? 
  also , please swap your y 's and z 's . 
  edit : oh boy , i touched a nerve , this was n't meant * that * serious, 
  there must be a very interesting , or very pathetic story behind that ... 
  it * used * to be a reality , mostly because road maintenance did n't have a fixed minimum budget in belgium . 
  things got a lot better the past 5 years , and i 'm kinda tire of this picture too . 
  we know it was bad , and it was fixed ( or is on the way of being fixed ) . 
  no matter how horrible that was , the majority votes based on their own gut feeling , and there adversity to our own government dominated . 
  mh17 ` only ' truly affected a few thousand people ( friends and family ) , the rest is shocked and sympathetic for a week , and returns to the status quo . 
  history of society development should be more prominent in modern economics - and politics discussions ... 
  city life at that time almost collapsed due to the amount of horses and the manure they produced . 
  cars and electric trams saved us from a lot of shit . 
  literally . 
  have a read : [ 1894 manure crisis ] ( http://www.historic-uk.com/historyuk/historyofbritain/great-horse-manure-crisis-of-1894/ ), 
  power politics , economics , and failure of reason and diplomacy . 
  and occasionally , to fight for what is right , though we make sure the other reasons are presented as ` the right thing to do ' too . 
  the world did get a lot faster though . 
  the money this costs us is peanuts compared to the money wasted elsewhere in the eu ( like strassbourg ) . 
  just because there are bad things to fix , we should n't break the good things . 
  we actually benefit quite a bit from a more stable and lawful ukraine .
