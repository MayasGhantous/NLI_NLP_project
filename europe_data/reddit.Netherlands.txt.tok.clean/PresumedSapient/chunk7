  not just trade , but a better ukraine helps stabilizing poland , romania and bulgaria too ( which will improve the unbalanced immigration from east to west ) . 
  the direct benefits are very small , but in the long term it 'll help us out too . 
  remember economics is n't a zero sum , them getting richer does n't mean we have to get poorer , we both profit if ukraine gains stability . 
   are people really this ignorant yes . 
  anything that smells like international cooperation goes against nationalist sentiment . 
  while you do have a point in general , it does n't apply in this case . 
  the against vote * was * heavily based on misinformation . 
  ukraine was , and still is on many levels a corrupt shit-hole , and this agreement was a step towards helping them fix that . 
  it was n't anything like some outrageous ` blank cheque ' opponents made it seem to be . 
  this was childish obstructionism ` to send a message ' . 
  the opposition may think the message hit home , the ` pro ' side just thinks sp , pvv and co proved themselves to be the uninformed populists d66 & vvd thinks them to be . 
  neither is the complete truth , and the entire debacle did n't really contribute to * real * solutions . 
  it * was * selfish . 
  voters are people , and are seldom rational . 
  people did n't vote for or against cooperation with ukraine , they voted against eu expansion , against ` the government ' ( hard feelings due to austerity , anything the government wanted was bad , especially if it can be explained as ` more money going into the ` bottomless eastern european pit ' ) . 
  it was a vote based on emotion , and had little to do with ukraine , or the actual contents of the agreement . 
  no , you 're wrong because you are generalising millions of people . 
  yes , some ` leftists ' are pretty delusional , some ` rightists ' too . 
  yes a lot of muslim countries actively prosecute gays , no that does not mean all muslims hate gays . 
  there are nuances and exceptions , these are after all individuals . 
  just let people celebrate this one little light in the darkness . 
  infrastructure ? 
  oh wait , you were asking for * competence * ... 
  clearly flanders is rightful dutch clay !, 
  depends where you live, 
  ` fressen ' is far less polite than the translation ` eat ', 
   the lack of diplomatic tact and realism from my ~ ~ fellow countryman ~ ~ about half the users in this thread pretty much standard fare in the internet :( . 
  the screamers get attention , the composed speakers sink down the thread or do n't bother posting . 
  do n't confuse france-bashing with the bashing of individual people who defend terrorism . 
  i like france , i respect their role and relevance in the geo-political balance . 
  i do n't like people who continue to celebrate the choice to bomb protesters . 
  these two are n't mutually exclusive . 
  you keep mixing up the issues . 
  i do n't object to france 's nuclear deterrent and its place in geo-politics the past 60 years . 
  i * am * glad someone else besides the brits have them . 
  i * do * object to people who ca n't admit mistakes were made . 
  there were other options to handle protesters . 
  choosing to give the terrorists awards and decorations , and continued celebration and defence of their acts ( as you do ) , is a very bad way to handle this legacy . 
  this , so much . 
  the ` only ' thing they have to do is admit it was * wrong * . 
  we all know shitty governments do shitty things , and that is * exactly * why we need to remember this kind of stuff . 
  if french people keep defending it they can never rise above it . 
  when ethics actually were relevant in politics ... 
   easier exactly , they took the easy option , * that * is my issue here . 
  convenience versus morality . 
  it 's a sliding slope which the french government at that time slipped down . 
   i do n't think you realize the difficulty of such an operation . 
  i do n't think you realise how much resources a nuclear power as france has at its disposal . 
  a more subtle solution was possible , if only the people in charge willed it . 
  in stead they opted for the authoritarian solution , hit it till you win . 
   because they are just stupid ? 
  no , just shortsighted and dumb ( and very smart people are very capable of doing dumb things , especially if they act on emotion ) . 
  they thought they could get away with it , which history has proven them otherwise . 
  i 'm not criticising france for their ` right ' to build nukes ( and test them ) . 
  i am criticising them for picking a very stupid solution to their problem . 
  they could have chained the ship down , sabotage the rudder , * anything * but something as stupid as bombing stuff in other peoples sovereign territory . 
  greenpeace may be idiots at times , that 's not an excuse to become one yourselves . 
  chain down the ship , board and arrest them , drag them into a swamp of bureaucracy . 
  do n't resort to bombing . 
  if you have to resort to killing peace protesters you are proving them right to protest you . 
  still not back at late 1830 's population level ... keep going !, 
   what 's the point in having an idea if you 're not gon na follow up on it ? 
  people with ideas usually are n't people with money . 
  agreed , it 's a classy expansion making the tower more useful without taking away from the design or style . 
  true that , still does n't justify what the french did though . 
  or maybe some of the other 5 million people who live in the area ? 
  the police officer who said that is ` probably a g\u00fclen sympathiser ' and will be fired tomorrow . 
  erdo & friends will say something like `` about one thousand traitors protested yesterday '' . 
  that 's what i fear . 
  good luck though , turkey deserves a honest government . 
  in dutch it 's ` tsjetsjeni\u00eb ' , also soft , the mix-up only happens in english ( for me ) . 
  yes . 
  in my defence , it * is * pronounced with a soft ch in dutch , and i have never had to actually use the work in spoken english , how could i have known ? 
   the ch in czechia is pronounced hard k huh , til . 
  in dutch ` tsjechi\u00eb ' * is * pronounced with a soft ` ch ' , i always presumed ( wrongly ) it was the same in english . 
  gon na quote myself there :  wide variety of mangled pronunciations even easier mistake to make in text . 
  my friend , it 's only * at first glance * , the mistake takes less than a second . 
  the country of c ** h ** ech ** n ** ya is n't really present in my day-to-day life , so when it passes in the news i * accidentally * think czechia , and am shocked *** because *** i do n't believe it . 
  after that miniature heart-attack i look again and see it is * of course * that far-away place ( from my perspective ) , and it has nothing to do with czechia . 
  it 's just an annoying naming thing combined with inaccurate reading . 
  and i 'm not the only one who makes that mistake . 
  depends on the language . 
  the only clear audible difference in english is the 'n' in chech ** n ** ya . 
  do n't place too much trust in people being able to separate the two with the wide variety of mangled pronunciations english has . 
  til , i was only a passive lurker at that time . 
  glad that got fixed and the current mods are quite chill , even with the occasional mods = nazies jokes . 
  nice one . 
  i agree the general audience of the media is n't that interested in nuance and details . 
  ` allegedly killed for reason x ' , or ` allegedly killed for reason y ' does n't make much of a difference for me , both indicate that : 1 . 
  local media sourcing is messy/unreliable in the region 2 . 
  rule of law is down the shitter 3 . 
  reason x or y does n't even matter , nontransparent judiciary & government will tell the ( inadequately informed ) media whatever they think/hope will keep the people in line . 
  in chechnya 's case it could have been gays , political opponents or religious extremists . 
  who or what they were are actually unnecessary details that ca n't be verified due to points 1 & 2 it does n't matter to me , i would n't know about the average person . 
  i think we very much agree on the above . 
  your comment that  were some innocent journalists and pro-democracy activists killed by the evil putin regime . 
  that 's what you are being fed by your propaganda is just a bit off - ~ ~ putin ~ ~ putting , i think there was no provocation for that bit, 
   with mods removing your posts  or  with downvotes for having different opinions ...  indeed not possible he means two different scenarios , though the formatting of the sentence did n't make that particularly clear . 
  mods remove posts because there have been a lot of click-baity altered headlines . 
  and a lot of users mis-use the down-vote button as ' i disagree button ' in stead of ` your argumentation is flawed ' .
