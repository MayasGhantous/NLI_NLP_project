  the first point is ` meh ' , because there has been no censorship of any particular topic . 
  the second point is quite fair , and a common problem on reddit . 
  what matters is that people got executed without trial . 
  it is a matter of a failing justice system and the collapse of the rule of law . 
  it does n't matter who those people were . 
  if it were extremists killed ` in action ' we would n't care , that would be a simple result of their own actions . 
  if those people were in custody , governments must act through he law , and not on arbitrary impuls . 
  every time chechnya is in the news i think ` czechia ' at first and am shocked by whatever barbarity is going on ` next door ' . 
  edit : a word, 
   sea ` high humidity farmland ' *, 
  if you ca n't name it , it does n't exist ? 
  it shows support for a particular cause to politicians * and * it advertises the cause to other civilians . 
  it 's something people without influence can do , and with some safety in numbers . 
  will erdogan listen to this protest ? 
  probably not , but maybe enough of his lackeys will . 
  no , it means you do n't have to pay * extra * when you cancel . 
  play stupid games , win stupid prizes . 
  it must be the downfall of your culture and civilisation !, 
  earthquake in aviation-land ? 
   siemens should be sanctioned for this . 
  definitely , but unless this is business as usual people should n't yell ` rules do n't apply to germany ' either . 
  if anything , in my experience germans are pretty strict about ` the rules ' , much more than some polish and spanish contractors i 've dealt with . 
  i 've been to bergen , how did people dry clothes before electric dryers ? 
  how did they paint their houses ? 
  according to french films southern france regards anything north of paris as a frozen hell-hole :p, 
  stay down and they 'll keep pissing on you . 
  stand up and they 'll want to kick you down again . 
  it 's gon na take a while before can read , comprehend , and understand there is a difference between people , government , companies , and the many individuals who do whatever they please any way . 
  if people ever will , that is . 
   norwegians got the most of the rai no engument there , i spend some time in bergen , it rains * every day * . 
  i wonder how ancient ` bergeners ' ( ? ), 
  were ever able to dry clothes or paint . 
  the netherlands get shielded from a lot of atlantic rain by the uk in a similar manner , 
  geography pushes ( clear ) humid air upwards , where it condenses and forms clouds . 
  also the reason why the alps define a north/south border , and why romania is split across the carpathian mountains . 
  the blue line iis the place where its most cloudy , going further inland ( towards russia ) those clouds have mostly rained down , so it gets more sunny . 
  finland has patches of yellow ? 
  nooo ^ ( oooooooooo ... . ) !!, 
  what for ? 
  agriculture ? 
  i know they dump petroleum wastes in the desert ( great for dust-storm prevention ) , so their own sand is probably toxic as fuck . 
  ah , if it was publicly i 'd respect that , if it 's just behind closed doors he can drop dead for all i care . 
  ~ ~ any politician that honest would get my vote . ~ ~ nvm it 's business as usual, 
  internet meme strategy is leaking into reality ? 
   in short : for me this law would be more for environment protection rather than consumer rights . 
  thing is , environment protection is important for consumer rights , because we 'd like to still have a liveable environment in 20 years . 
  it 's just that most individuals ca n't seem to make the right choice when overwhelmed by problems of every day life . 
  having slightly ` less ' efficient performing devices ( heavier parts ) is the choice individuals are very bad at making , thus for our own benefit it should be made by ` higher ' institutions . 
  reminds me of this video : [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iln85wko0qk ) , basically , usa plays on ` easy ' difficulty :p . 
  depends on the situation . 
  nazi jokes are a bit tricky , though more general war jokes happen all the time here . 
  germans in the netherlands & poland , whenever france and russia are mentioned in the same article there is always someone who thinks of something to link it to invading russia in the winter , etc. 
  just regular banter . 
  that is the spread of the range of this squirrel right ? 
  it also looks like a [ taiga vegetation map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia#/media/file:russia_vegetation.png ) . 
  which is n't strange , since animals stick to suitable topography , not whatever region we named them after . 
  u/croatian _ ent probably thinks of the geographic region of siberia , which is generally considered to be [ east of the ural mountains ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia ) . 
  from the old [ sibir khanate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khanate_of_sibir ) . 
  i 'd say all europeans get a pass . 
  it 's that peculiar thing when you and your friends can call one another names , but if someone from ` outside ' your little circle of friends does it , he 's can fuck off . 
  this is r/europe , * of course * it is :d german-france war is so absurd today it can only be a joke , rejoice !, 
  what does it take to become norwegian ? 
  besides seducing a gorgeous nordic woman ? 
  oh , i do n't doubt you can write any language in any ( phonetic ) script . 
  it 's just that most people only bother to learn one : their ` own ' . 
  maybe dual-script reading and writing is common in some countries , but it is n't the norm . 
  so they say : * we * want more national choice , but * you guys * ca n't choose cooperate more !, 
  then we say : well , that is * your * choice !, 
  i only know they are one of the poorest countries on the continent . 
  i was talking about languages written in latin , thus a ` cyrillic language ' refers to ' a language written in cyrillic . ', 
  fixed for clarity though , tnx . 
  they put the train on a boat ? 
  so , the entirety of norway could pack up and live in luxury elsewhere ? 
  abandon the country , everyone move to a few tropical islands bought for the occasion ? 
  most work happens in the offices , i understand a lot of meetings do n't need all members present , so 3/4 empty sessions are n't a problem . 
  *** however *** , there should be at least one ` full ' session once a week/2 weeks to set priorities . 
  that meeting would also be the moment for when to invite foreign dignitaries or perform the opening & closure of presidencies and stuff . 
  nothing but good things , i hope ? 
  ^ ( i know we got some shit too , working on that though ), 
  maybe invite some of the migrants for some young blood ? 
  they can ask whatever they want for the processed aluminium , as long their profit + energy + transport is lower than the insanely expensive cost of processing it almost anywhere else . 
  not so much concessions as a transition period . 
  though the time of city-states like san marino and andorra is pretty much over . 
  it 'll be multi-speed europe . 
  we all pretty much agree on what the problems are , some will chose to stream-line integration , others want less . 
  i 'd say give both of them what they want . 
  as long eu foreign policy is as hypocritical as it is , i wo n't blame anyone not wanting to join . 
  it 's easier to learn a new language if you already know the alphabet . 
  i can make some sense of italian or spanish , despite not speaking it . 
  i can even ` kinda ' attempt speaking turkish , though the pronunciation will be horrible . 
  a language written in cyrillic script ? 
  blank . 
  save for one or two characters i would n't know where to start pronouncing it . 
  i can read a little greek because of my scientific background , little things like the greek ` p ' is a ` rho ' and pronounced as such . 
  kazakhstan changing to latin alphabet increases the distance in trade and politics with russia , and brings it closer to other latin-alphabet users . 
  dutch tomatoes used to be called ` wasserbomben ' in germany ( water-bombs ) . 
  used to be , because they have improved quite a bit the last 10 years . 
  outside pressure works both ways though ... 
  yellow and red bell peppers are way sweeter than the green ones . 
  have you tried grilling them ?
