technically you need to take the 4th root ( hypercube root ? ), 
  of 4.6 % , but since the numbers are small it does n't matter that much ( do a taylor expansion around 1 to convince yourself ) . 
  i was n't upset or anything , everyone makes numerical mistakes ( i 've seen more than one phd fuck up single digit addition ) . 
   the gross domestic product ( gdp ) in the united states expanded by a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.6 percent in the second quarter of 2014 over the previous quarter like i said the us number is annualized . 
  all the other numbers you quoted are quarterly ( seasonally adjusted ) . 
  the us number is the annual rate , a 4.6 % quarterly growth results in 19.7 % annual growth . 
  in q2q terms the us growth is 1.1 % ( = 1.046 ^ 0.25 ) . 
  we 've got something even better than oil , control over the best inland shipping routes in western europe ( the [ rijn/rhine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhine ) and the [ maas/meuse ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meuse_ ( river \\ ) ) . 
  the [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) 's industry needs to be connected to the world markets and one of the simplest way to do so is via the [ port of rotterdam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_rotterdam ) . 
  good social policies and governance on top of our transshipping economic bonus gives the netherlands a great hdi . 
  though it needs to be said we do n't score that much higher than germany/switzerland/sweden / slovenia ( slovenia 's ranking is far more impressive , considering where they came from ) . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  in the netherlands our gendarme does most of the riot control and i believe this is also the case in france ( ? ) . 
  since the wiki article described the guardia civil as being similar to both of them and explicitly mentioned a riot control unit , i made the obvious assumption . 
  i see the article has changed the headline to $ 1m , good to the see the guardian taking their editor responsibility seriously . 
  however it does change the nature of the article for me . 
  spending $ 1bn on riot gear ( in a country the size of spain ) is almost the same as waving the nazi flag over parliament , while $ 1m might as well be routine maintenance . 
  the author of this article is innumerate . 
  there is no way in hell spain spent $ 1bn on riot gear . 
  there are ~ 80,000 [ guardia civil ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_guard_ ( spain \\ ) ) , so that breaks down at $ 12,500 per member . 
  considering not all of the guardia civil are part of the riot control units , the effective number is even higher . 
  for that amount you money you could equip every officer with a cheap toyota . 
  unless the author can provide a primary source , i 'm calling this article bunk . 
   i do n't want `` liberal democracy '' to be the only acceptable political system for member-states , or in europe or the world . 
  there should n't be a monopoly on what people are allowed to think is a legitimate government . 
  you hit the nail right on the head , but strangely it went into the wrong plank . 
  not having a monopoly on what people are allowed to think is precisely why we need `` liberal democracy '' . 
  few politicians articulate this properly , but freedom of conscience is what separates the `` liberal '' democracies from the illiberal ones ( russia , iran and to a lesser extent turkey and china ) . 
  it is only in `` liberal '' democracies that minorities are free to express their desire for radical change . 
  in the netherlands we have a [ fascist party ] ( http://www.nvu.info/ ) , we have a [ communist party ] ( http://www.ncpn.nl/ ) and we even had a [ pedophile party ] ( http://www.pnvd.nl/ ) . 
  liberal democracy is always open to change , it is even open to the idea of it 's own abolition . 
  you can not be politically active as an anarcho-syndicalist in russia or china , but you can in the liberal west . 
  i 'm certain that in a few hundred/thousand years a better system of governance will come along and it will be the liberal democracies that will embrace it to the fullest . 
  however do n't fault liberal democracy for not jumping on every utopian bandwagon . 
  we 've already experienced where most of these excursions end up and have paid far to high a price for doing so . 
  we shot russia in the foot , it just so happened that the russian foot was stomping on our own . 
  considering we work mostly as sitting desk monkeys and russians as standing laborers , it seemed like a winning trade . 
  those are the resulting percentages and seats for this eu election ( according to the exit poll ) . 
  all the listed parties are also seated in the house of representatives ( [ see here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_representatives_ ( netherlands \\ ) ) ) , but the percentages are quite different and * christenunie/sgp * are two separate parties in parliament . 
  a short highly biased personal description of the parties , for those not familiar with dutch politics : | party | percentage ( seats ) | position | | : ----------- | ------------ :| : ------------ :| | d66 | 15.6 ( 4 ) | center right democrats , very strongly pro eu | cda | 15.2 ( 4 ) | christian democrats/conservatives , pro eu but in favour of reforms | vvd | 12.3 ( 3 ) | free market liberals/conservatives , pro eu but with strict limits on eu powers | pvv | 12.2 ( 3 ) | right wing populists , anti eu in all aspects | sp | 10 ( 3 ) | socialists , anti eu but mainly because they consider the eu to be too neoliberal | pvda | 9.4 ( 3 ) | social democrats , mainstream pro eu | christenunie/sgp | 7.8 ( 2 ) | christian conservatives , in favour of increased european cooperation but opposed to integration | groenlinks | 7.3 ( 2 ) | greens , strongly pro eu | partij voor de dieren | 4.2 ( 1 ) | animal rights party , critical of eu but mainly concerned with animal rights issues and the environment | 50plus | 4.2 ( 1 ) | elderly rights party , believes in strictly limited eu ( which is smaller than it is today ) . 
  i would agree with you ( and so would most of europe ) if this was still 2013 . 
  unfortunately 2014 has shown us that russia 's increasing willingness to throw around it 's military might present a problem in the near future . 
  if we do n't provide the currently unaligned ( former ) cis states with an opportunity to into the eu 's sphere of influence ( this does n't have to be full membership ) they will end up in the russian sphere . 
  having ukraine , moldova and georgia in the russian sphere is n't necessarily a problem . 
  however a bigger russian block will have an easier time creating divisions between member states , which might limit our future political options in those areas where russia would have issues ( military integration , common energy policy , common foreign policy ) . 
  so from pure realpolitk considerations we have reasons to want to expand eastward faster than we normally would . 
   for how many generations should we pay for them ? 
  we are not . 
  just because they are a net contributor does not mean we are paying for them . 
  if you go out to dinner with a friend and you split the bill evenly while he ate $ 1 dollar more , that is not the same thing as paying for his dinner . 
  greece is getting support to the terms of 1.3 % of their gdp , they are paying for themselves we are just giving them a boost . 
   why do you want to add to the eu corruption without having a clue on how to solve it ? 
  you might as well ask me when i stopped beating my wife . 
   so , when is greece catching up ? 
  maybe someday , maybe never , it does n't matter . 
  if i may repeat myself : * by the very nature of any union there will always be net contributors and recipients * . 
  it has been fun my dear swedish troll , but now i 've got work to do ( if you do n't think you 're a troll just ask yourself when was the last time you let someone change your mind or inform you ) . 
   look at where china was in 1981 , chile , india etc. 
  they have had tremendous development - look at greece again . 
  china and india as a whole are still dirt poor , the [ richest regions of china ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_chinese_administrative_divisions_by_gdp_per_capita ) have a ppp adjusted gdp comparable to portugal . 
  chile is doing better , but still not even as rich as portugal . 
  if you look at [ the data ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=pg78h3gmq4ci_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=eur_hab_eu#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=pps_hab&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu&amp;idim=country:el:es:pt:it&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) you will see that greece , spain and portugal have been catching up to the european average . 
   always have to be the same regions ? 
  redistribution is not about absolute wealth , it 's about relative wealth . 
  the [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) has been the economic heart of europe since the 16th century and will be so for a decent bit longer ( though the eastern europeans are catching up very fast ) . 
  spain has grown faster these past 20 years then say sweden , but it started at a lower base so it still has a while to catch up . 
   why arent greece paying ? 
  greece is paying , quite a bit actually . 
  sure the eu is netting them a * `` generous '' * 267 euro per capita , but they did take on massive amounts of debt to bail out mainly german banks . 
  you keep focusing on the eu budget as if it that is all you need to know about the economics of the eu , it is n't . 
  if tried on some different perspectives you might learn everything is a whole lot more complicated  ... 
  should n't the eu have the answers to my questions before going forward ? 
  do n't i deserve that ? 
  there are plenty of answers , though not all satisfying . 
  if you ca n't find any that 's on you . 
   there is no scientific reason as to why greece have n't developed into a net payer . 
  like i said , by definition in any union the most economically productive transfer part of their wealth to the less productive . 
  this law holds for families , tribes , cities , provinces , states , multi-state unions , kingdoms , empires , dominions or whatever . 
  without net transfers there is no union . 
   why are you against stopping ineffective practises ? 
  when going exclusively by * effectiveness * all eu money should be spent in the least well of places . 
  this is because the marginal utility of spending is highest in those places where people have the least . 
  i 'm not arguing for this , but apparently you are . 
   other countries manages to become less corrupt , but no them . 
  why ? 
  like i tried to say , the problem is difficult and not one we could reasonably expect to fully solve in a decade . 
  the problem of corruption is inherently linked to the strength and trust in social institutions , these are not built in a day . 
  the social institutions we have in western europe today are all incredibly old . 
  my local water board was formed in the 13th century , our current constitution is almost 200 years old ( and the country was well functioning for another 2 centuries before that ) . 
  eastern europe has only had truly free civil rule for 2 decades . 
  if you want the eu to change the romanian government so that it runs as well as the swedish one , then you are asking an unreasonable thing . 
  it does need to be said that even the worst run place in the eu ( probably bulgaria ) is still only doing as bad as china when it comes to corruption . 
   we have treaties that we keep breaking and ignoring ... without having a clue how to change things . 
  those good for nothing countries we added in 2004 are currently driving a good bit the growth in the eu . 
  this whole notion of looking at things exclusively in terms of receivers and providers is also incredibly misguided . 
  the providers in the eu are those best placed to exploiting increased market size . 
  therefore the exact accounting of things needs to take in productivity gains the net contributors make from having easy access to receiver markets . 
  a lot of people these days would argue that this is a deal the so called receivers are on the losing side of . 
  i 'm not sure if i agree with this , but it is a reasonable thesis . 
  i 'll admit that i like the idea of the eu a lot more then what we actually have , but i would say the same about any country .
