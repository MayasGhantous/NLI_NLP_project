  i would absolutely defend myself before allowing my country to turn into some communist shit hole like the ussr . 
  you 're a funny bloke . 
   i am also wondering how my own life would improve under communism , because that is what you advocate for . 
  yes , yes , have another one ;  workers , peasants , we are the great party of labourers . 
  the earth belongs only to men ; the idle will go to reside elsewhere . 
  how much of our flesh have they consumed ? 
  but if these ravens , these vultures disappear one of these days , the sun will shine forever . 
  | : this is the final struggle let us group together , and tomorrow the internationale will be the human race . 
  no , i was going by the national average . 
  ` gdp per hour worked ' in 2012 was 49 dollar in finland and 28 in poland according to the oecd . 
  i do n't know about this particular industry , but even then , it 's not only labour costs that make a ( competitive ) difference . 
   well i want to know which idiotic comment i made . 
  what more is there to tell ...  you want to make it illegal to make money ? 
  and shit got even better . 
   better dead than red . 
  you 're not taking this all serious right ? 
  if you send an idiotic comment , that may just be what you 'll recieve . 
  you 're taking this way too serious , it was just banter . 
  i know , that 's part of the joke . 
  i doubt it . 
  i voted for finland . 
   the state oppresses and the law cheats . 
   tax bleeds the unfortunate . 
   no duty is imposed on the rich ;  the rights of the poor is an empty phrase . 
   enough languishing in custody !, 
   equality wants other laws :  no rights without duties , she says ,  equally , no duties without rights . 
   | : this is the final struggle  let us group together , and tomorrow  the internationale  will be the human race . 
   stand up , damned of the earth stand up , prisoners of starvation reason thunders in its volcano this is the eruption of the end . 
  of the past let us make a clean slate enslaved masses , stand up , stand up . 
  the world is about to change its foundation we are nothing , let us be all . 
  | : this is the final struggle let us group together , and tomorrow the internationale will be the human race . 
  :|  there are no supreme saviours neither god , nor caesar , nor tribune . 
  producers , let us save ourselves , decree the common salvation . 
  so that the thief expires , so that the spirit be pulled from its prison , let us fan our forge ourselves strike the iron while it is hot . 
  | : this is the final struggle let us group together , and tomorrow the internationale will be the human race . 
  * sees france below sweden * . 
  that probably did n't happen a lot did it ? 
   how else would you suggest this wealth transfer then ? 
  a wealthcap is on the assets held , not on income . 
  any wealth possesed above the cap will be 100 % taxed . 
   income tax is universally accepted by leftists as the best way to redistribute wealth . 
  good for them i gues . 
  soesterberg is closed . 
  it 's now being renovated to some hiking route and natural zone , and the old runway is used for some glide planes club . 
   you 're also suggesting an income tax . 
  could you not make things up ? 
  are you sure that 's it ? 
  i gues we 'll have to put the greater-netherlands idea in the ijskast , we 've grown too far apart . 
  i mean a small distance can be explained by the frenchies , but this is inexcusable . 
  maybe he means northern ireland . 
   none of you seem to understand what my reply is saying . 
   yup , confirmed , one more specimen . 
   the whole world knew what happened exactly . 
  yet there 's always someone who 's even more retarded than the last . 
   no one believes you hence the downvotes . 
  i 'm not allah , you do n't need to believe me , just do n't lie and it 's fine . 
   5 the netherlands 178  24 belgium - 35 what has gotten into these belgians lately ? 
  i 'm use to them always being below us , but each time the distance seems to increase . 
   how about stopping immigration right now ? 
  we ca n't . 
   zero solidarity for poor policies , thank you very much . 
  that 's fine , i was never a supporter of including the eastern countries . 
  we could continue as a western european union and drop all the eastern countries that do n't want to cooperate . 
  i do n't want solidarity with you either if its a one way street , we could use the cohesional funds to shelter the refugees instead of ruining it on countries like poland . 
   not like it 's been warned just once right before entering the airspace right mate . 
  ten times in five minutes . 
  none of you seem to understand what my reply is saying . 
  but never mind , just downvote and post some irrelevant crap like the rest . 
   the plane was warned before entering airspace to change heading ,, 
   sure they conflate exclusion/identification zone with airspace , now we 're talking about something . 
  conflating airspace with exclusion/id zone is a rather enormous difference in meaning in this context . 
  you might feel indifferent at these attempts to bend the truth , i believe this is very harmful . 
  if all mayor newsoutlets say it like this it becomes the new truth , and what 's next , next year they where bombing turkish cities and ignoring warnings to stop bombing ? 
  reminds me of a story where my great grandmother had a car accident , the village 5 km 's further she broke her leg , the next village she died . 
  she was okay by the way , just some bruises . 
  that would be fine by me . 
  if you 're going to shoot our sattelites out of the ` sky ' i 'll expect we 'll return the favour . 
  and then we switch to glonass , 
   again , you did n't read the sentence properly . 
  what the fuck ? 
  * i * did n't read it properly ? 
  you ca n't make this shit up . 
   in a letter to the un security council , turkey 's permanent representative halit cevik wrote that two aircraft of unknown nationality had approached turkish airspace near the town of yayladagi in hatay province . 
  map of purported flight path of russian su-24 shot down by turkish military on 24 november 2015 according to russian and turkish militaries the planes ** were warned 10 times over the space of five minutes ** via an `` emergency '' channel and ** asked to change direction ** , he added . 
  both planes disregarded the warnings and then flew 2.19 km ( 1.36 miles ) and 1.85 km ( 1.15 miles ) into turkey for 17 seconds from 09:24:05 ( 07:24:05 gmt ) , according to mr cevik . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34912581 )  do you see that ? 
  it means the reast of the sentence is referring to what `` turkey insists '' . 
  turkey never insisted that . 
  the whole point is incorrect . 
  because you seem incapable of reading . 
   the plane was warned before entering airspace to change heading , and shot at the very second it crossed into it . 
  it was never ` warned to leave the airspace ' . 
  that 's all there is to say . 
  they 're lying , it 's incorrect , and i pointed it out . 
  make of it what you want . 
   because of that you can ignore the fact that for a month ahead of time russia was told by turkey to stop going through their air space . 
  has absolutely nothing to do with it . 
   it 's definitely not russias fault that they kept ignoring turkey 's demands has nothing to do with it . 
   it was most likely a mistake , but either way it 's an incredibly negligible detail . 
   it 's a lie , that 's all there is to it .
