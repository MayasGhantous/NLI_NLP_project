  that 's all nice and all , but i am dutch , and we generally communicate with germans in english as we both speak that and very few speak ( acceptible ) german . 
   furthermore , if you work for the federal government of belgium , chances are that you 'll work with and for german speaking belgians . 
  unlikely , considering begium has more arab speakers than german speakers . 
  in the rare case you would , these germans will speak either french or dutch . 
   you 're giving money to people that currently do n't get any benefits , lots of people recieve benefits , even if you earn 30k euro per year you still recieve benefits . 
  at least in the netherlands . 
  even if you 're a millionair you still recieve benefits ( mortgage rate tax deduction ) which means the upper class will probably lose some . 
  ( which is a good thing given the current wealth divergence dynamic ) the system also allows a whole army of bureaucrats to be fired , so there 's more money to be dispersed . 
  the system is also less prone to fraud , research has shown health increases and people become more creative . 
  what you 're saying is not a fact , it 's just an assumption , and will depend entirely on the implementation and the current system ( s ) it will replace . 
  then it will replace it partially , point still stands , there 's no need to finance it , the finances are already there . 
   that 's 10 % of the entire gdp . 
  sounds ridiculous . 
  while finland currently spends around 31 % of gdp on social expenditure . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=socx_agg ) it means that they could likely lower tax income , or increase the basic income without changing taxes . 
  keep in mind this will replace the welfare state , not be additional to it . 
   somehow russia would be content with the status quo in latvia but it was n't in crimea , donetsk , abkhaiza , south osettia , transnistria , azerbijan , etc. 
  just because the us bombed vietnam and many more countries does n't mean they 'll bomb all countries . 
  same goes for russia , each situation is unique , and carries its own history , issues and solutions . 
  if you want to simplify things to ridiculous levels , be my guest but i 'm not going to entertain kindergarten levels of discussion . 
  up until a few years ago you did n't even know what crimea was , hell your media did n't even know ukraine was in europe . 
   you are being willfully blind so as to excuse russian actions . 
  people such as yourself that try to paint the victims as the aggressor are exactly why eastern eu countries are fairly certain western europe would sell them out to russia . 
  and quite frankly i do n't blame them for thinking that . 
  kay , i wo n't be the one having to face the consequences . 
  if you want to carve up europe in divisions , enemies and play war games i ca n't stop you , but i wo n't be part of it . 
   many of the threats that would be posed to places like the baltics are only not realistic because of an effective deterrent . 
  if you think that . 
   which is often considered a provocation against russia in western europe . 
  it is a provocation . 
  good lord what an abomination , why just not use the frisian flag , it 's beautiful . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.campingheeg.nl/images/slides/slidehome/01%20watersportcamping%20in%20friesland.jpg ), 
  you 're grossly oversimplifying the regions they took , and therefor showing little understanding of the political situation in europe , the dangers and even the realistic threats posed to us . 
  that 's a good point . 
  however that means we 'll never have reliable data and we 'll never know exactly how many . 
  germany will be around 1,1 million by the end of this year , sweden 200.000 , the netherlands 60.000 . 
  finland 30.000 , denmark 20.000 and norway 20.000 ? 
  i do n't know all the numbers , and they 're hard to find because many numbers are irrelevant , so correct me if needed , but that would make slightly over 1,4 million . 
  so how is that doubtful ? 
  i estimate that will be slightly below 1,5 million by the end of this year . 
  and denmark , finland and norway probably ? 
  you 'll need a qualification to be a bouncer at the nightclub , you 're not allowed to just work as a bouncer without the required papers . 
  flemish is not a language , it 's called dutch . 
  no but some people said it was going to be profitable . 
  it 's going to be hard and costly , not only financially . 
  that 's good however going to school for a syrian in germany is pretty hard , first there 's the language barrier , then there 's the cultural barrier , and then there 's the education being more difficult and of a higher standard . 
  some may also have trauma 's or other forms of emotional suffering . 
  learning german is also not like learning french for us . 
  they probably had little influence from germany , and not only that , will need to learn a complete new alphabet coming from arabic . 
  fair enough , but ` his claims to legitimate authority ' are more accurate than ' a legitimate excuse for being late ' in this context . 
  we arrive at the same conclusion once more , something about rightful british clay i wanted to say . 
  the dictionary gives several definitions , they 're substitutes , not an inclusive definition . 
  therefor some thing legitimate does not have to be able to be defended with logic or justification , and therefor we can say it is rightful british clay . 
  notice they 're all substitutes . 
   not many , what . 
  a respectable would be nice . 
  like oxford dictionary that i have quoted . 
    having a legitimate right to property , position , or status :  legitimate , conforming to the law or to rules : fine by me , leads me to say , it 's rightful british clay . 
   cool champion . 
  okay kiddo , no need to get your panties in a twist . 
   exactly how i feel about national identity  you 're free not to be , but i would advise getting the mental/psychic issues causing those feelings treated before opting out of your environment . 
  it could help you , it is not healthy behaviour for a human , that is essentially a group animal , to feel the need to dissociate himself with fellow humans around him . 
   just found a shady definition from a random dictionary  ( prenominal ) having a legally or morally just claim : [ 1 ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rightful )  : according to the law [ 2 ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rightful )  having a just or legally established claim  ( prenominal ) having a legally or morally just claim : the rightful owner [ 3 ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rightful )  officially or legally accepted as right or correct [ 4 ] ( http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/rightful ) how many do you want ? 
   refuses other definitions i never refused other definitions , try reading next time . 
   other reliable and respected dictionaries and just mumbles about some sentence like it is his holy bible . 
  ok champion , ok . 
  i 'm going to try not to laugh at you , but it will be hard . 
  it was a figure of speech , i did n't actually mean a few dozen , but the number is pretty irrelevant , i mean we have more arabic speakers in the netherlands than that , yet i would n't advice anyone learning arabic if they want to work in the netherlands . 
   ` having a just or legally established claim ' . 
  there 's really no more to say , it 's rightful british clay . 
  the state debt fell up until we adopted the euro , then it slightly rose , slightly fell , and the never ending crisis started . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://www.google.nl/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;idim=country:nl:fr:de&amp;hl=nl&amp;dl=nl#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:nl&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=818377200000&amp;tend=1386457200000&amp;hl=nl&amp;dl=nl&amp;ind=false ) the euro fucked us over properly economically speaking , not by our debt levels , but on other levels . 
   how about some global organisation thanks , but i wo n't be part of it . 
   and based on needs instead of greed and lust for power so not made or controlled by humans . 
  you 're free to send an invitation to outer space , perhaps some higher form of life will respond . 
  so who is going to regulate the airspace and economic zones then ? 
  rightful can be used to describe a legally just claim . 
  it can be used to describe a morally just claim too , but does n't have to . 
  so the british base area 's can be called rightful british land . 
  i do n't trust you , and do n't put a lot of value in some forum topic . 
  the dictionary disagrees , i 'll take the dictionary over your rustling jimmies if you do n't mind . 
  i 'm just living in greece currently for a while , i 'm dutch . 
  and dutch government employees did n't retire at an average age of 53 . 
  if greece gives the islands , eez and airspace turkey wants you will not have any disagreements between turkey and greece anymore ? 
   they are only important to those that want to control said nationalities . 
  they are important to everyone . 
  research has shown your environment in which you grow up is more influential in the forming of your personality than your genetics . 
  this ' identity ' based on ( sub ) nationality is very important , because it encompasses very real attributes you can not change , that have formed you personally . 
   i say time to leave those behind as well all they do is cause trouble at this point people cause trouble , this does n't . 
   it 's you people being unable the debts that you yourself have collected , i do n't have debts thank you , my state also has a relatively low debt . 
   up until a few years back your retirement age was 53 i wish , it was 65 in the netherlands and rising , but i 'm not going on retirement before 75 , if i even have a retirement . 
  i 'll probably have to fix that myself . 
  thank the babyboom generation for eating the ruif empty . 
   there 's plenty of use in low skilled labour for the meanwhile in the uk yes , other countries not so much . 
  ` low skilled labour ' would be filling the supermarket shelves or working in a shop . 
  will still require good knowledge of the language and communication , and there are tons of unemployed looking at the same job which are more qualified by being younger and born here . 
  the rest of the ` unskilled jobs ' ( for whatever is left of it , it 's getting really scarce ) is done by poles , at least in the netherlands . 
  and employers are not going to replace poles with refugees , they work twice as hard and earn below the minimumwage . 
  syrian education quality is n't up to par with western standards to put it mildly . 
  many of these degrees are worthless , and in sectors legally requiring a degree not sufficient to be employed .
