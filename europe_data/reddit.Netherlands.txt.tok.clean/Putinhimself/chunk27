  oh yes that 's a great idea to counter division . 
  how about you ` fight ' against the causes of this division mr. schulz . 
  albeit a bit late , we 're not yet at the point of throwing the baby out with the bath water . 
  they 're already very damaged . 
  appararently the museum was shocked by the state the painting pictured was in . 
   sounds funny but when noone buys it there where some rumors about potential buyers in kazakhstan and afghanistan . 
  maybe a few are already sold considering they 're only offering 12 paintings right now instead of 24 . 
  i did n't say he was . 
  just shows it 's not impossible . 
  so you think if belgium would split all regions would leave the eu and the benelux ? 
  i do n't think so , you 'll still have open borders and it would remain in your economic sphere . 
   so ... you really think `` the germans '' are more easily persuaded by those `` dark intentions '' then other `` races ( ? ) '' . 
  german is not a race , it 's a multiethnic , multicultural society based on a diminishing group of germanic heritage and a growing group of turks , eastern europeans , syrians , pakistani 's and arabs . 
   last time i counted the frontnational came out with close to 30 % , while the npd has a meager 1,5 % and the afd 7 % ( untested in elections ) ... would n't that be an argument for his explanation rather than against ? 
  the eu is unravelling yet the germans keep supporting it en mass ? 
  i would n't vouch for this argument , but there 's something about german culture that makes its people follow all extremes of either side , there seems to be an issue with the middle way . 
  you already lost brussels . 
   vladimir putin said it is `` quite possible '' that russia will one day join the eurozone [ 1 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/currency/8163347/putin-russia-will-join-the-euro-one-day.html ) ca n't find the other one , it was the german foreign minister that said that around 10-11 years ago . 
  no , free trade with the east led to lower living standards in western europe . 
  there 's no confusion , they can mean the same thing . 
  ` having a just ** or ** legally established claim ' . 
  does n't say ** and ** . 
   current estimates are that about 12 million africans were shipped across the atlantic [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantic_slave_trade ) it 's on the lower estimates , it was likely smaller . 
  europe has a military alliance with the us in the north atlantic , not in the world . 
  we also have no stakes in the pacific game . 
  i would n't be opposed to aid the us indirectly , but we have militarily not much to seek in the pacific . 
  perhaps the uk some with the bit and france with new caledonia , but nothing considerable . 
  europe has no stakes in the china-us confrontation , it would be best for us to play the middle ground and help either whenever it serves us . 
  the netherlands has a decent navy , a larger ability to project power than germany too , then there 's the danish italians and spanish but i gues that 's it indeed . 
  when did you look and where did you look at ? 
  last time they had a referendum , northern cyprus voted for unifiying the island with a decisive majority ( 65 % ) . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cypriot_annan_plan_referendums,_2004#turkish_cypriots ), 
  it 's mister vladimir for you ms toryukunionist . 
  the un has a list for this . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_list_of_non-self-governing_territories#change_of_status ) northern ireland is not considered a ` non-self governing territory ' , gibraltar is indeed . 
  ( which does n't mean the un thinks the territories listed should change ` owner ' , only that they should have say in their ` owner ' . 
  oh jahweh no , did we reach the point where israel joins the discussion ? 
   i ca n't comment from eastern/central europe point of view , but good luck convincing them to be friendly with russia , after what 's happened these last few years . 
   that wo n't require much convincing if they 're shown the consequences , if they 're not willing to give other people the same opportunities perhaps we should consider withdrawing their opportunities . 
  a western european union of only the developed countries would be a great alternative to the eu if the other option fails . 
  and if eastern europe would still like to play cold war , they will be the ones seeing the consequences for that , and rely on the us to act as their deterrent . 
  eastern and central europe will have to learn they ca n't have it all . 
  western europe accepted them into their community including all the issues they had to endure for that , they helped rebuild their countries , opened their purse and doors for them , now it 's time western europe gives that same opportunity to the russians , and the remainder of the balkans . 
  putin has said he could see russia using the euro , german ministers have voiced possible eu membership of russia before , it is not impossible . 
  nato could be disbanded , and europe could finally be independent again . 
  fair enough , but that happened , we ca n't change borders based on demographics or statistics from nearly a century ago . 
   is it all about recognition ? 
  no , but it tells something . 
  i would rather see russia and the rest of europe finding a way to establish a sustainable and growing relation . 
  offer them prospects of joining our community in time as an equal , offer them free trade , visa free travel and other cooperative measures that will benefit both until that time . 
  we would not need to serve as a us military base if we could find a way to live * with * russia , not without it . 
  the us can fully concentrate on the pacific , and europe can carve its own path . 
  and a moroccan with a cough wo n't be hard to come by either , and that 's not because of the spanish flu , though it would be related to spain . 
  we do n't draw borders based on geography , eventhough it would be helpful . 
  it 's up to the people that live in a region to decide , this is why we have the principle of ` self determination ' enshrined in international law . 
  and northern ireland wants to stay in the uk , as gibraltar wants too , and ceuta and melila want to stay in spain . 
  le pen wants france to exit the eurozone . 
  ( and more ), 
  you can claim all you want , but the northern irelanders have some differing opinion about that as far as i 'm aware . 
  how many countries do not recognize northern ireland ? 
  i mean as an outsider it would be great to see ireland unite as one country , i bet many brits would n't mind that either , but the largest issue will be the people of northern ireland themselves . 
  greece is not a functioning state . 
  but if it was , it could do without fences since it 's waters we 're talking about . 
  but in all seriousness , where you referring to northern ireland ? 
  or we just cut any foreign involvement in the muslim community and let the muslims here have their own religion . 
  i 'm not comfortable with the state dictating anything , but i 'm even less comfortable with states like saudi arabia , qatar and turkey dictating our minorities . 
  if muslims want to preach their religion in europe , perhaps it 's time for a european islam , and i would feel most comfortable with the muslims living here building that up themselves , without any foreign involvement , no finances , no influence . 
  odds are in some time european islam might become a global example , and a threat to saudi and qatari radicalism like no amount of bombs could pose . 
  that 's some bad cough you have there , hope you do n't catch a cold . 
   and none of them are rightful anyway . 
   having a just or legally established claim : legitimate < the rightful owner  b : held by right or just claim : legal < rightful authority  the british sovereign base area 's are rightful british soil . 
  there 's no bad will from ukrainian authorities , there 's just corruption and thiefs . 
  i said the world , not eu . 
   the borders are rarely tested against large numbers of civilians . 
  and even when they were , historically speaking , civilians were generally allowed to pass through ( as refugees ) . 
  during yugoslav wars , or even as recently as ukraine . 
   the yugoslav wars and ukraine are two totally different issues , because they are a european problem it should be a european responsibility . 
  the others should be their regional responsibility , we are not the worlds ' trash bin . 
   when 5 people try to cross the border illegally , you have options . 
  when 5000 try to cross it under the threat of death , you 're out of options . 
  there are enough options . 
  detention , deportation , fences . 
  and there 's no threat of death , stop lying . 
  spain seems to do quite a good job in melila and ceuta , hungary too can secure its borders . 
  it 's complete nonsense to suggest people ca n't secure their borders . 
  you can never stop everybody , but 1500 coming through is compeltely different from 1.500.000 walking whereever they please because all law and order has collapsed in europe . 
   the turks wo n't kill them , but the sea between here and turkey will . 
  these boats are made for one-way trips only . 
  we can supply boats that are for a one-way trip too . 
  we can also supply airplane tickets for a one-way trip , and they can wait in detention centers until they 're good to go . 
  the biggest weapon here is the surge effect , if people do n't make it , less and less will come . 
   also there is no proof of ukr government rejecting collaboration that you seem to be implying in your posts . 
  there 's enormous proof . 
  these paintings are in ukraine , we know who has them , and yet ukrainian authorities have not arrested anyone nor confiscated the paintings . 
  ukraine can return these paintings and silverwork if they want to , but they do n't . 
   borders were never intended to be `` defended '' from masses of civilians . 
  they where . 
  half the world would want to live in a handful of countries , but these countries will be at the level of somalia if they did . 
  these borders where our only way to preserve our way of life , our prosperity , security and stability . 
   they are not `` attacking '' them , they are literally attacking them , hurling stones , arson and cutting fences .
