   they are being allowed in because not allowing them in would endanger their lives . 
  the turks wo n't kill them , their life is not in danger , their dream of a life on welfare is . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/12/07/geroofde-schilderijen-westfries-museum-opgedoken-in-oekraine ) all attempts to get the paintings back have failed . 
  that 's why the museum now seeks publicity . 
  out of follow up research it appeared the ukrainian volunteerbatallion has contact with influential ukrainians . 
  about the matter there have been negotiations at a high level . 
  recently bert koenders ( foreign minister ) has spoken with president poroshenko . 
  [ 2 ] ( http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/4178173/geroofde-kunst-westfries-museum-ontdekt-in-oekraine.html ) mayor yvonne said that there has been contact with the ukranian ambassador on monday morning . 
  it also seems the paintings may have been irreparably damaged and that their current state has shocked the museum . 
   worth less than a million euros is dubious , if not absurd . 
  they where worth around 10 million euro 's when they stole them , now estimated only 500.000 because of the extensive damage . 
  in any case their value is irreplacable for the dutch . 
  finland and austria lowered the average ? 
   to my knowledge it just became public and i do n't know why you think that ukrainian authorities are not willing to cooperate . 
  because the dutch and ukrainian governments have had high-level talks about this , which have apparently yielded nothing . 
  and the people involved do n't expect them to return ( they fear they 'll be sold to afghanistan or kazakhstan ) the museum also says it ` runs deep into the top political levels of the ukrainian government ' it seems to me they have searched for public attention now that they do n't expect the paintings and silverwork to be returned . 
  the article mentions the museum ` broke the silence ' . 
  finland and austria . 
   you guys do know that the only way to `` close '' a border to refugees is close cooperation with the country they came from , right ? 
  that 's only in the cesspool of incompetence called the eu that 's incapable of defending its own borders . 
  functioning states can guard their own border without asking others to do it for them . 
   turkey is n't on the european continent . 
  neither is cyprus , come to think of it , turkey still militarily occupies an eu memberstate . 
   but if i remember my geography class , the continent of europe ends with slovenia bordering to the balkans . 
  europe ends halfway through istanbul at the bosphorus , turkey has a small region in europe bordering greece and bulgaria . 
  181.036 and some . 
   that 's why i looked at the bigger picture . 
  why not even bigger then if you want to use irrelevant numbers , it 's even less relatively to the global population . 
   and i 'm sure they will be . 
  why ? 
  the dutch hold little hopes of seeing them back , and this has been going on for a while now , somebody just stepped to the public now to tell it . 
  seems like a good argument for the referendum though , hope for them they will have returned them before the referendum . 
  but i gues ukranian authorities are n't willing to cooperate , so there 's no way to return the art and silverwork . 
  such a shame to see these douchebags squander other peoples ' national heritage . 
   about 0.2 % of eu 's population . 
  we 're quite okay . 
  if you could share them with the eu , yes . 
  but this is just germany alone . 
  and ;  in an interview published by die welt newspaper on monday , eu parliament chief martin schulz , a member of germany 's social democrats , accused the government of running a backlog of more than 300,000 unprocessed asylum applications . 
  so by the end of the year , around 1,5 million people have reached germany . 
  that 's + / - 1,9 % of the german population . 
  so within one year , + / -1,9 % of the german population arrived as asylumseekers . 
  i would call that huge . 
   do you even realize what you are advocating for ? 
  the last thing the ukraine needs right now is for a robespierre or stalin to come to power . 
   yes , change . 
  with the absence of a functioning legal system and corruption having taken hold of virtually any organisation there are not many tools left for a flowery revolution . 
   i know most people in central europe only view the eu as a monetary redistribution system nowadays , but for the people on the periphery the old ideals are still alive and worth fighting for . 
  perhaps because they are n't part of it , and do n't exactly know what it is . 
  the old ideals will die as soon as they see the inside . 
   it 's the collective hope of the ukrainian people to one day be part of our area of freedom , prosperity and justice that provides the fighters against corruption the political power to oppose the entrenched system . 
  if they 're looking for freedom , prosperity and justice they should stay clear of the eu , which has brought the exact opposit on europe . 
   should the netherlands really vote against the preparatory treaty with the ukraine , it would be a highly symbolic blow to their efforts . 
  after such a rejection , i would n't even be suprised if a lot of ukrainians turned back to russia in disappointment , since europe would not seem to want them . 
  this is not a geo-strategic game between two empires , and the argument of ` ukraine siding with russia ' is not going to change my judgement . 
  the question should be wether ukraine will be a contributive member or not , not wether they ` side with russia or not ' . 
   for the people of the netherlands , the outcome of the vote wo n't matter after a few days of newspaper headlines , but for the ukraine it might decide the fate the nation . 
  so i would really urge you to think hard about what you are really voting about . 
  it will be the difference between squandering more money on corrupt countries and importing more criminality or not . 
  the outcome will have more effects than just newspaper headlines . 
   so i would really urge you to think hard about what you are really voting about . 
  i have thought about it hard ever since the ukraine crisis , thank you . 
   ( was it the president that said that the referendum does not make a change to the agreement ? ), 
  can they be restored ? 
   that sounds so backwards . 
  the people of ukraine suffered through two revolutions , a civil war and an economic crisis to fight the corrupt system and reorient themselves westward , all in the hope of a better future in a united europe . 
   i 'm very sorry for them . 
  so many people suffer every day , though me paying taxes that disappear in the pockets of ukranian billionairs and thiefs is n't improving a damn thing for anyone of these people . 
   how would you feel if after all that has happened and all the lives that were lost your efforts would be negated by a simple referendum in which the citizens of one of the most prosperous countries of earth decided to reject you not meeting their lofty standards ? 
  understanding , i would n't be looking at other people to solve the mess , primarily because they ca n't , and even more important , because they wo n't . 
  they may be poor , but they 're rich enough to buy a rope , smart enough to tie a noose , so start stringing people up . 
  that 's how you clean a system , there 's no money in this world that will solve corruption , and every european that thinks it does is not only incredibly naive , but also suffers from amnesia as moldova losing one billion dollar , 1/8th of their gdp , is a rather recent event . 
  now if ` help ' means forming a european anti-corruption body in ukraine , europe sending judges , sending police officers , sending intelligence agents , sending teachers , civil servants and instructors that i could support . 
   russia lacks the airlift capabilities for a major ground conflict with turkey in territory that is literally adjacent to turkey . 
  russia has the second largest airlift capability in the world . 
  they have more transport aircrafts than the british have combat aircraft . 
  kind of needed too . 
  not if he had included the greater netherlands movement [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_netherlands ) . 
  there 's not any separatist movement in the northern netherlands , so i do n't know what he did to our north , do n't even recognize the flag . 
  i 'm temporarily living in greece for work , i 'm dutch , and i 'll be back for the referendum about the association agreement with ukraine to vote no . 
  i 'm not greek , and they where right . 
  well it 's a movie of course , not a documentary . 
   reformist forces in the ukraine need to be supported not with my money . 
  this is the issue , corrupt governments rarely ever succeed in comprehensive reforming , because everybody in the system is corrupt , to reform it you need a complete new system . 
  currently it 's one corrupt government leaving and a new corrupt government taking office . 
  it will take generations to reform ukraine , and they may well never succeed . 
   demonizing the country only strengthens the corrupt elite . 
  misrepresenting the country only strengthens the new corrupt elite . 
   because ukraine is the only european country with a politician tied to criminal activities ? 
  politician ** s ** , and civil servant ** s ** , and an entire system not arresting criminals . 
  stop downplaying this please , ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries on this planet . 
  great , so when will ireland start having a military to contribute to this ? 
  but the painting looks damaged . 
   proof : http://nos.nl/data/image/2015/12/07/238743/864x486.jpg is that painting damaged ? 
  what does the paper say ? 
  michiel de ruyter was a rather good movie , it does n't cover the independence , but still advicable . 
  though not a tv-show . 
  so basically just a continuation of the feudal system . 
   it was the biggest slave industry in numbers in history i doubt it . 
   arab slave trade was the practice of slavery in the arab world , mainly in western asia , north africa , southeast africa , the horn of africa and certain parts of europe ( such as iberia and sicily ) beginning during the era of the muslim conquests and continuing into the early second half of the 20th century .
