  in the end it 's in everyone 's interest to have good relations and prosperity for everyone in europe . 
  i 'll definitely miss you guys though :(, 
  putin made le pen a traitor . 
  thats too simple and takes away any sense of agency of the people who actually created isis and the competing factions in libia and syria . 
  other than that you 're now just changing his words into something that fits your narrative . 
  not making a qualitative statement on their deaths . 
  i only wanted to point out that nato not being active against terrorism is absolutel bullocks .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_security_assistance_force#nato_nations ) this is incredibly disrespectful to those who gave their lives assisting our american allies . 
  yeah , it 's pretty bad . 
  a few years ago i got my degree is clinical psychology , but even with all the waiting lists it was impossible to find a job . 
  there 's just no money for the system , and its incredibly sad , a waste , and especially stupid as mental health care is great as a preventative tool . 
  is it psychological ? 
  our psychological health care was gutted as part of the austerity budget cuts , but working in health care in the netherlands i do n't really recognise the problems you described with waiting lists other than the psychological care problem . 
  medication is typically covered but might require a small copay , and was introduced to deincitivise frivolous use . 
  same with the deductible . 
  and to be honest , considering how much is wasted , and how much more other people need the limited number of resources available , it 's not a bad idea . 
  that 's not how i remember things ... 
  to be fair we used locals most of the time . 
  we had an austrian governor during the german occupation in the second world war if that counts ? 
  it did n't really leave us with a thirst for more though ... 
  the republic had been in decline since the early 18th century though , and by the time the french invaded the stadholderate had become hereditary . 
  the french stole everything they could take , but even before the republic was rotten . 
  i 'd say that the outpost at [ dejima ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dejima ) was too small to say we either controlled , influenced or colonized japan , or put japan in our sphere of influence . 
  i thought this bit from the wiki page was pretty interesting though :  times were especially hard when the netherlands ( then called the batavian republic ) was under french napoleonic rule . 
  all ties with the homeland were severed at dejima , and for a while , it was the only place in the world where the dutch flag was flown . 
  yeah for sure !, 
  that 's why i opened with ' * for all its accomplishments * ' . 
  the romans certainly did a lot of good and that should certainly be acknowledged , but i just wanted to point out they had their flaws as well . 
  the chieftain 's name is [ calgacus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calgacus ) although tacitus , the author of * agricola * , the work the quote is from , had an agenda when writing his book . 
  while it 's not perfect , i think wikipedia is a great place to look for sources and if what is written matches with what i already know to be true from books i do n't mind copy/pasting rather than having to write my own text . 
  it 's a really complex process , but generally the following factors are thought to have contributed . 
  * uncertainty in the imperial succession inherent in the system * augustus did n't proclaim an empire as much as he totally dominated the republic . 
  he was voted a number of offices for extended periods of time by the senate , and his people controlled the other offices . 
  imagine him being the chief justice of the supreme court , the president , speaker of the house and all other positions of power at the same time , for 10 years at a time . 
  that was basically the position of the emperor until diocletian introduced his reforms . 
  in this system , there intentionally was no official monarch so also no official heir . 
  this meant that whenever an emperor died without an obvious heir , anyone with power could make a play for the supreme office . 
  while not * the * cause of the fall , the civil wars this flaw in the system led to definitely contributed to it . 
  the literally classic example of the imperial succession done both at its best and its worst is the case of the five good emperors and what happened afterwards . 
  when [ nerva ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nervax ) came to the throne in 96 ad after domitian was assassinated , he was already 65 years old and not particularly popular . 
  to increase his chances of survival and because he did not have any male children , he adopted a popular general , [ trajan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trajan ) , who is widely regarded as one of the best emperors of the empire . 
  trajan also did not have any male children , so he also adopted a general . 
  this kept happening until marcus aurelius became the emperor . 
  marcus aurelius did have a son , commodus , of gladiator fame , and for the first time in almost a hundred years - a hundred years gibbon thought of as the happiest most prosperous time in all of history - instead of a capable general being adopted , the heir would be the son of a reigning emperor and he turned out to do such a terrible job he was assassinated . 
  * the crisis of the third century * commodus ' assassination lead to the year of the five emperors , the short-lived and rather bad severine dynasty and when the last emperor of that dynasty was assassinated in 235 , to the [ crisis of the third century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crisis_of_the_third_century ) . 
  basically 50 years of civil wars and invasions , the crisis was incredibly disruptive to trade and did a lot of long-term damage to the empire . 
  cities which had n't had walls in centuries began building them . 
  rome was fortified with [ huge walls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aurelian_walls ) . 
  at one point , the empire was even split up in [ three parts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crisis_of_the_third_century#/media/file:map_of_ancient_rome_271_ad.svg ) . 
  i 've read that the question should n't be how the roman empire fell in 476 , but how it survived this crisis . 
  survive it did though , and it was soldier-emperor [ diocletian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crisis_of_the_third_century ) who accomplished it . 
  he transformed the empire , and he transformed the position of emperor from that of officially being merely the ` first citizen ' ( i.e. 
  the princeps ) to one more like that of the monarchs of the eastern kingdoms ( the dominate ) . 
  * plagues * i feel plagues are not mentioned enough in these discussions . 
  [ the antonine plague ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonine_plague ) ( 165-180ad ) killed as much as 5 million people , and up to a third of the total population in some areas . 
  this issue came back later during justinian 's reconquest of italy , too . 
  so many people died trade was impacted , and the armies could n't find enough recruits :  some direct effects of the contagion stand out , however . 
  when imperial forces moved east under the command of emperor verus after the forces of vologases iv of parthia attacked armenia , the romans ' defense of the eastern territories was hampered when large numbers of troops succumbed to the disease . 
  according to the 5th-century spanish writer paulus orosius , many towns and villages in the italian peninsula and the european provinces lost all their inhabitants . 
  as the disease swept north to the rhine , it also infected germanic and gallic peoples outside the empire 's borders . 
  for a number of years , those northern groups had pressed south in search of more lands to sustain their growing populations . 
  with their ranks thinned by the epidemic , roman armies were now unable to push the tribes back . 
  from 167 to his death , marcus aurelius personally commanded legions near the danube , trying , with only partial success , to control the advance of germanic peoples across the river . 
  a major offensive against the marcomanni was postponed until 169 because of a shortage of imperial troops . 
  * a series of bad emperors * having been weakened so dramatically , the empire had difficulties fielding the massive armies , and even in periods where this was n't an issue , the changing nature of the tribes across the borders added to the difficulties of managing the empire . 
  whereas rome in it 's long history had been lucky quite a few times in having someone step up to save her like marius , scipio or diocletian , her luck ran out after the death of theodosius ` the great ' in 395 . 
  the last emperor to rule both the west - and eastern halves of the empire , he was followed by a series of weak and often very young emperors . 
  a series of civil wars had depleted the manpower of the army , and increasingly the romans had been recruiting foreign troops in their armies . 
  the vandals ' conquest of africa , alaric sacking rome , much of the bad things happening to rome near the end was at the doing of her terrible last emperors . 
  for example , when emperor honorius came of age , he ordered the execution of highly successful general stilicho and a bloodbath , with romans killing the wives and children of their * foederati * ( i.e. 
  barbarian ) troops all over italy . 
  obviously many of these * foederati * troops mutinied , joined the visitgoths and participated in the sack of rome two years later - the first time the city had been sacked since the gauls did so exactly 800 years earlier . 
  this is one story , but the later decades of the empire are full with tales of intrigue and stupidity like this one . 
  the most famous other story is of honoria , sister of the western roman empiror valentinian iii . 
  when valentinian iii wanted to marry her off to a roman senator , she sent a courier to atilla the hun with a ring , which he eagerly interpreted as a marriage proposal . 
  he then asked for half of the western empire as her dowry . 
  when he was rebuffed by the emperor , he had the excuse for invading he was looking for and invaded . 
  * migrations * so having had a history of increasingly bloody civil wars , a series of plagues , bad rulers and evolving neighbours , the walls came crashing down when whole tribes moved into roman territory . 
  maybe if the empire were in better shape economically , or if its army could recruit more troops , or maybe if there were a better leader in charge , of maybe ... you see my point . 
  i do n't think the fall of the empire in the west was inevitable , but it became more and more likely and the years went on . 
  we of course also have to keep in mind that saying the empire fell can give the wrong idea . 
  people did n't wake up one day without an empire . 
  even when romulus augustulus was deposed in 476 , people thought there 'd be a new emperor soon . 
  even without an emperor , administration continued as it had for decades . 
  the catholic church also ensured continuity as a major institution in much of the west . 
  edit : typos edit 2 : more typos , minor updates, 
  it 's too often forgotten that for all its accomplishments , the romans had a dark side too , like massive slavery . 
  there 's a quote in tacitus from a caledonian chieftain giving a speech on the roman invasion of britain :  we are the last people on earth , and the last to be free : our very remoteness in a land known only to rumour has protected us up till this day . 
  today the furthest bounds of britain lie open and everything unknown is given an inflated worth . 
  but now there is no people beyond us , nothing but tides and rocks and , more deadly than these , the romans . 
  it is no use trying to escape their arrogance by submission or good behaviour . 
  they have pillaged the world : when the land has nothing left for men who ravage everything , they scour the sea . 
  if an enemy is rich , they are greedy , if he is poor , they crave glory . 
  neither east nor west can sate their appetite . 
  they are the only people on earth to covet wealth and poverty with equal craving . 
  they plunder , they butcher , they ravish , and call it by the lying name of 'em pire ' . 
  they make a desert and call it ` peace ' . 
  exactly . 
  the roman tolerance was facilitated by the conquered peoples and the romans both having a polytheistic belief system which could include deities from either side : conquered peoples could include the cult of the emperor because it was n't a heretical thing to do .
