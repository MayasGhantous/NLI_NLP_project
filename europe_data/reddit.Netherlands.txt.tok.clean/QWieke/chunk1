while i can remember that time , the conversion happened when i was young enough that money did n't really matter to me . 
  i dont convert back at all . 
   because ~ ~ humans ~ ~ [ life ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29694513 ) . 
  come on now , i could easily see an islamophobe making that statement in all seriousness , [ poe 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s_law ) really is a concern . 
   i aint maybe i should put an / s behind the post better be safe than sorry , sarcasm is rather hard to detect in plain text format . 
  indeed , it may not be warzone bad , but they 're still worse than iran . 
  well , not at the moment no , but could n't we force companies that want to operate within the eu to abide by our rules ? 
  or we could just impose these rules on eu companies . 
  i 'm just saying that government can concern themselves with the safety and security of services provided by companies , though the international nature of the internet does complicate things considerably . 
  but politics could introduce safety/privacy standards and regulations , similar to what has been done in the car industry . 
  i 'm not sure , there are quite a lot of people in russia , i wonder what happens if we control for population . 
  so i tried to calculate the number of refugees per 1 million inhabitants for each of these countries in 2013 , using wolfram alpha for population statistics and the image above for refugee statistics . 
  these are the results : 1 . 
  eritrea 2609 1 . 
  serbia 2337 1 . 
  iraq 316 1 . 
  pakistan 115 i do n't know enough about the geopolitics involved to draw any conclusions , but russia sure did drop down the ranking a bit . 
  when , some time ago , i found [ this blog on the word grinfucker ] ( http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/03/28/dont-be-a-grin-fucker/ ) on reddit i could not help but think of our pm . 
  sure , but two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  plus i think this kind of breech of trust is a lot worse when it 's the police that is responsible , rather than some tabloids . 
  but does n't ebola only spread through bodily fluids ? 
  if so going full hazmat seems a bit much . 
  edit : i was mainly thinking of [ this askscience thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2d3p7d/why_is_ebola_not_as_contagious_as_say_influenza/ ) where people explained it does n't really spread through sneezes/coughs from person to person like influenza does . 
   how on earth are we getting ` green ' energy if we do n't buy it from norway ? 
  nuclear ? 
  if only it had political/popular support . 
  sure but the seperation did n't struck me as intentionally punitive , just something to facilitate the rehabilitation . 
  unless i 'm utterly misreading the article , are n't they rehabilitating the sons rather than banishing them ? 
  afaik you do n't need a wietpas in nijmegen . 
  i 'm not sure if that is the best way to quantify racism . 
  you may as well call it a map of `` countries with the most racists who do n't care what you think of them '' . 
  just because her actions are understandable does n't mean they should be legal . 
  that way vigilante justice lies . 
  does [ this ] ( http://download.omroep.nl/nos/docs/zanoli.pdf ) link work ? 
  [ obligatory what-if xkcd link ] ( http://what-if.xkcd.com/53/ ), 
   pax ( a peace organisation ) i 'm not sure what else one would expect it to be with that name . 
  i would probably experiment with different forms of governance , some kind of techocracy/evidence-based governement combined with some kind of [ multi body sortition ] ( http://www.publicdeliberation.net/jpd/vol9/iss1/art11/ ) seems interesting . 
  short term i 'd basically try to find a system that would enable me to efficiently figure out how to reach/enact the goals/ideals of myself and the populace ( benevolent dictatorship yo ) . 
  i could start talking about policy stuff i 'd probably want to see changed atm ( basicincome/education/environment / privacy/ip-laws/etc ) , but if i actually had the power i 'd like to vet the plans first . 
  long term i 'd be aiming at a [ science ] ( http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/science_victory_%28civ5%29 ) / [ diplomacy ] ( http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/diplomatic_victory_%28civ5%29 ) / [ cultural ] ( http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/cultural_victory_%28civ5%29 ) ( pre-bnw version ) victory . 
  or in non civ terms , peace on earth and people in space ( cause , fuck it , i like to dream big ) . 
  i 'm just pointing out that your source could be used to support both viewpoints , depending on which part you consider . 
  ( not that i think that the uk is more diverse than the us , it 'd depend on how you define such things and i ca n't really be bothered with that . ), 
  hell a dickwaving contest about who has the most diversity is pointless ( especially since it is highly sensitive to how you define it ) . 
  we 're human beings , groupthink is second nature to us . 
  even if you had a country of clones it 'd take them 1 nanoseconds to form utterly arbitrary groups and 2 nanoseconds to get inter-group conflicts going . 
  it 's just / r/shitamericanssay , well some americans . 
  there are two rankings there , the other one has the uk at 203 and the us at 204 . 
  the anti european union european union ? 
  sounds more reasonable that way . 
  however if you want to stop them by democratic it would be possible for your opposition to win the majority . 
  and then you 'd have to allow it ( otherwise it would n't be democratic ) . 
  still a bit weird if you compare it to your original statement ( though perhaps that one was exaggerated on purpose . ), 
   i am not going to allow an undemocratic structure to have military control over my life . 
  when i see a claim like that i ca n't help but wonder how you 'd stop them if they tried . 
  ( apart from emigrating . ), 
   i 'd never surrender my national identity . 
  you would n't have to . 
  most people have all kinds of identities defined at all kinds of levels . 
  for example , i 'm a brabander ( province in the netherlands ) , dutchmen and european . 
  if the netherlands suddenly loses it 's status as a nation i would n't stop identifying with it . 
  do n't prostitutes get paid ? 
  i would n't dare value art over human lives , and i 'm pretty sure vatican city has the fewest inhabitants . 
   ** workplaces ** etc. 
  but ** pubs ** pubs are workplaces . 
   bright orange ( yellow ? ), 
  the bottom half of the bar , from the bottom up , is red - orange - yellow , the top half is a bunch of weird shades of green . 
  sure , but we have dykes . 
  ( without them 30 % of the netherlands would be flooded . ), 
  but it 's text not sound . 
  well i grant you it 's not the most polite way of referring to a person 's mouth , but a bird 's beak is definitely a `` snavel '' where i 'm from . 
  i 'd probably translate `` bek '' to `` mouth '' or `` jaw '' not `` beak '' ( `` bek '' can be used to refer to the mouths/jaws in general , not just birds ) , so it 'd be a bird-mouth-animal . 
  no real wizards have pointy hats . 
  national governments : claiming responsibility for positively perceived things , blaming the eu for negatively perceived things . 
  so we 've solved the waste issue then ? 
  cause that what most green parties find objectionable about it ( combined with nimby syndrome , which makes implementing a solution , assuming you have it , even harder ) . 
  that and some concerns regarding uranium mining and cost . 
   definitely stronger than most of the national alde parties deserve indeed , while i would n't vote for him he at least seemed like the kind of politician i would n't really mind having him in the ruling coalition ( though maybe not representing the largest fraction ) , mark rutte on the other hand ... 
   at the end of the day , money makes the world go around . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's conservation angular momentum :p . 
  i honestly ca n't remember the last time i heard `` honour '' being used as meaning something good . 
  usually it 's used by people with easily bruised egos . 
  honour retaliation may be a better translation since it refers to a retaliation against a perceived sleight to ones honour . 
  ( i just checked google translate for other translations of the word `` wraak '' which translates to revenge/retaliation/vengeance / vendetta/requital depending on context . ), 
   i 'd add that in france , where i live , the eu constitution was rejected by the people in a referendum , only to be later ratified by parliament . 
  surely that would be a failure of the french democracy , not the eu democracy ? 
  bit of a chicken vs egg situation though . 
  lot of people in the netherlands think the eu should be `` more democratic '' and being able to elect the president of the commission certainly would be , but it 's barely talked about in the media so barely anyone knows . 
  i do n't know if we have bbc world , but we certainly have bbc 1 & 2 . 
   sorry , i do n't really know anything about european politics . 
  do n't feel bad , practically no european knows anything about european politics either . 
  i was at a debate on the european identity last thursday and the guy presiding over the debate did n't even know we were going to elect the president of the commission this year . 
  the national media does a really bad job of informing people on the eu ( unless it 's something they can spin as the eu fucking up ) . 
  i do n't know if cynisism regarding the motivation for these two candidates is entirely justified . 
  there were primaries , we , the members of the green parties , got to vote on them . 
  and i know i just voted for the one i liked best based on ideology ( keller ) . 
  what 's the difference between freedom and lack of restrictions ? 
  or are you saying that if our journalist were better their freedoms would be taken away ? 
  damnit i thought i had opted-out of that . 
  another reason to get the ubuntu phone .
