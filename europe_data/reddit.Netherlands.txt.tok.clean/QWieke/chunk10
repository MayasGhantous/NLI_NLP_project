  so i would n't be surprised if the minister does n't minds the tax haven status . 
  apparently we ( the dutch ) are going to have to contribute an additional [ $ 350 to $ 500 million ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2013/05/dutch_eu_budget_top-up_could_r.php ) . 
   many use netherlands to avoid paying taxes in their own countries [ that is being worked on . 
  ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2013/04/mps_call_for_action_on_tax_hav.php ), 
  if the [ categories defined on wikipedia ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/wet_wapens_en_munitie#categorie.c3.abn_voor_wapens ) are anything to go by these categories have nothing to do with the nature of the weapon ( well , not directly ) . 
  they 're simply based on what kind of restrictions are placed on ownership of these weapons . 
  it simply means that you ca n't own a throwing knife unless you have a license/permit . 
  so if 0.58 * mortgage interest rate < other account interest rate you 'd still make a profit . 
  is this the current state of affairs , or is this how it was before they started reforming the law ? 
  ah , alright . 
  how the hell did you read that in my post ? 
  i was just pointing out that the eu does have a significantly larger population than the us . 
  cause i think it is a bit disingenuous to compare non-subjective measures in such a case . 
  and i feel that the whole `` lack of successful startups '' thing is probably nonsense , see [ juremes 's comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1dxs53/discuss_why_do_we_suck_such_much_at_starting/c9uwzp9 ) and [ sanebrz 's comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1dxs53/discuss_why_do_we_suck_such_much_at_starting/c9v062x ) . 
  mojang ( makers of minecraft ) and cdproject ( [ gog ] ( http://www.gog.com/ ) a popular digital distribution platform ) are both from europe . 
  eh , the eu does have a significantly larger population ( 500 million vs us 's 300 million ) . 
  eu 's gdp per capita is lower . 
  ( not that our economy is doing terrible . 
  just felt that the comparison is n't that simple . ), 
  not an expert , but i think i understand it . 
  if you can deduce the entire interest on your mortgage from tax it would n't cost you anything to postpone mortgage payments . 
  ( you pay for the mortgage interest using the tax deduction so your mortgage does n't increase . 
  effectively turning it in an 0 % interest loan , since you were going to lose the tax money anyway . ), 
  meanwhile the money on your savings account does gather interest allowing you to effectively earn money by having a mortgage . 
  hell if this is how it works it is financially smarter to take out a mortgage even if you already have all the money . 
  is it just me or is this title rather editorialised ? 
  i half remember some attempt to get a pan-european party going last election . 
  though the [ newropeans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newropeans ) do n't seem to have gotten any seats . 
  ( i do n't remember if i voted for them or not , it would have been either them or greenleft and i know the last has proper plans for europe . ), 
  i 'm pretty sure they 're going to have to in the 2014 elections . 
  what with the eu commission president being indirectly elected during those elections . 
  [ according to cbs ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/industrie-energie/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2007/2007-2187-wm.htm ) we were in between italy and germany in 2007 , i doubt this would have changed much . 
  i googled around a bit and found some [ more recent figures ] ( http://geert-hofstede.com/netherlands.html ) ( they 're from 2005 ) on the writer 's website . 
  while these are n't the exact same figures ( or even the exact same dimensions ) , you 're conclusion still stands . 
  [ graph with comparisen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ea86zre.png ) taken from the website . 
   `` doing nothing means that is will be much , much more costly for us all , '' merkel said at the start of the conference in berlin , adding that she was under no illusions about the amount of work involved in such a pact but that `` waiting is not an option . '', 
  i 've heard influential politicians call for action on climate change before , yet nothing came from it . 
  ( i 'm glad she said it , i just do n't want to get my hopes up . ), 
  awesome , thanks for such a well written reply . 
  quite interesting read . 
  ( i 've followed a couple of sociological/psychological courses at uni , quite interesting to see such topics tackles scientifically . ), 
  though i do notice that your source ( riding the waves of culture : understanding cultural diversity in business ) is about 16 years old . 
  i would n't expect things to have changed that much . 
  ( though the us did have the whole war on terror + 9/11 thing happening to them . ), 
  what are your reasons for rejecting brazil ? 
  frankly i do n't know enough about the place to evaluate how similar we are to it . 
  ehm , if you do n't mind me asking , why the fuck you at the end of your comment ? 
  phew , quite glad to see our guys did the right thing . 
  what with all the recent tax dodging scandals , i would n't be surprised if they did n't . 
  btw , you do realize that is n't a dutch flag you have as flair right ? 
  ( your post seems to be written from a dutch perspective , i found it a little confusing . ), 
  that 's not very welcoming for international students though . 
  ( most of the courses i 've attended that were taught in english were taught in english to accommodate foreign students . ), 
  * raises hand * i 'm 25 and i know of her . 
  granted i probably would n't have known of her if i had n't watched all episodes of hignfy . 
  ( big fan of british panel shows . ), 
  one should n't forget [ pilarisation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pillarisation ) . 
  up until a couple of decades ago the netherlands effectively contained 4 separate societies ( catholic , protestant , socialist , liberal ) called pillars . 
  the wiki page calls it vertical segregation , each pillar had their own political parties , shops , social institutions , etc. 
  but a lot of things ( land/cities/resources ) had to be shared and since none of these pillars could achieve a political majority , compromise was the only way anything gets done . 
  they certainly seem optimistic , hopefully they 're right . 
  the last 2 charts sure show some nice figures , rising non-eu exports in both greece and italy ( either at or beyond levels from a couple of years ago ) . 
  they 're called * penicillium vanoranjei * and * p.maximae * both clear references to our royal family . 
  i 'm no fan of christian symbols , but that is a pretty spiffy looking flag . 
  there was a funny bit of drama accompanying this event . 
  two motions were put forth one by greenleft and the other by the socialst party ( both saying basically the same thing ) . 
  the labour party ( part of the ruling coalition ) refused to back the motion by the socialist , but did back the one by greenleft . 
  suffice to say the socialist seemed a bit offended . 
  ( samson , leader of labour , claimed they did this because the greenleft 's motion was more specific and ambitious . ), 
   . . which ranks children 's well-being in 29 industrialized countries , while greece , italy , portugal and spain are at the bottom . 
  yeah , that is just blatantly false . 
  did n't realize you were referring to the article you linked yourself . 
  the free market is a useful system , but it is essential that we recognize that it has it 's limits . 
  the problem ( probably ) is that there is far more money to be made in the high-end housing market , so that 's where the private companies end up . 
  meanwhile the middle/lower/poor classes still need housing but there 's not enough profit to be made in supplying this demand . 
  so the government has to step in . 
  ( and i 've often seen in the news how previously poor/lower neighborhoods being upgraded , forcing the previous tenants to move , cause they ca n't afford living there anymore . 
  i suspect this is what this law is supposed to counteract . ), 
  i ca n't say for sure . 
  but greece and the us seem quite similar ( at [ the interactive page ] ( http://www.unicef-irc.org/report-card-11/ ) at least ) . 
  the main advantages greece seems to have over the us are infant mortality rate , immunization rates , relative child poverty and child poverty gaps . 
  so better healthcare and social safety nets seems to sum it up . 
  i sincerely doubt unicef would mess with these figures , what would they have to gain by doing so ? 
  hell yeah , best in 3 out of 5 dimensions ( material well being , education , behaviors and risks ) , and best in overall !, 
  still though , surprised we managed to snag the nr 1 education spot , what with the constant budgets cuts and meddling it has had to endure over the last couple of decades . 
  edit : the children 's voices part is pretty cool , though what the hell france ?!, 
  edit2 : holy crap , we only have 8.36 % child obesity !, 
  better late than never ? 
  probably because of the social and psychological effects of being poorer than most ( if not all ) of once peers . 
  people 's feelings/experience only considers our own wealth relative to our peers , not the people on the other side of the globe who are worse off . 
  and it would likely also compensate a bit for costs of living variance between countries . 
  granted if we 're being completely and brutally honest we 're all filthy filthy rich for having reliable access to food , water , shelter , electricity , etc. 
  ( you know , what we consider the basics . ), 
  ha ha , took the words right our of my hands . 
  that was my first thought and i 'm not even british . 
  i just do n't think it is appropriate to use that word in that way , it 's a serious mental disorder . 
  ( a whole spectrum of mental disorders actually , there is no such thing as a typical autist , or autistic reaction . ), 
  that 's just stubborn contrariness , nothing to do with autism . 
  brabander living in gelderland here , germany 's cool . 
  it 's just a single english entry in their blog , [ the rest of the site ] ( https://decorrespondent.nl/ ) is in dutch .
