  i think they put it up there for the sake of foreign news outlets . 
  they 've been tweeting the link at some foreign journalist . 
   so do the members pay on ongoing fee to support it going forward ? 
  it 's $ 60 per year to be a member and that is the only financing that will support it ( no commercial donors , sponsors or advertisements ) . 
  at the moment they 're intending to release one article a day . 
  it 's going to be a purely digital platform and they seem to intend to make use of the interactivity and flexibility it allows . 
  non-members get limited access to a limited selection of articles . 
  members get full access and will get a say in some of the spending decisions ( what big projects to do , which new journalist to hire , etc ) . 
  they set themselves a requirement of getting 15 000 members and a starting budget $ 900 000 in 30 days to ensure that the project has sufficient support . 
  i 'm quite glad they managed it . 
  truly independent ( investigative ) journalism is something any society could use , glad to see we 're going to get it ( assuming everything goes as planned ) . 
  maybe that 's why it is an international keyboard ? 
  ( [ here 's a picture of the layout ] ( http://dry.sailingissues.com/us-international-keyboard-layout.html ) . ), 
  yeah , that is a bit awkward . 
  i get \u00e9 with altgr + e. 
  my default keyboard layout is united states international . 
  we could use the [ syst\u00e8me international ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/systeme_internationale#general_rules ) , while it does allow both the point and the comma as decimal symbol it states that the space should be used as thousand separator . 
  so either 1 000,00 or 1 000.00 . 
  since i discovered that i can type $ with altgr +5 i prefer to use $ over the word euro . 
  so $ 1 million , or $ 1 * 10 ^ 6 if i 'm feeling particularly mathematical . 
  also avoids confusion regarding long and short scale . 
  ( american vs british billion for example ), 
   the fucking idiot dutch finance minister jeroen dijsselbloem , he 'll be at a late night current affairs talk show this evening to talk about the cyprus bailout . 
  ( for the dutchies , he 'll be at [ pauw en witteman ] ( http://pauwenwitteman.vara.nl/ ) . ), 
  for those , like me , who were wondering what the human development index is :  the human development index ( hdi ) is a composite statistic of life expectancy , education , and income indices to rank countries into four tiers of human development . 
  from [ wikipedia - human development index ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) . 
  yeah it 's my default criticism if the data lacks a subjective measure . 
  it ai n't that bad , though some circular lines in the background ( ala a polar grid ) would probably help . 
  interesting idea , though would n't the graph be more informative if it showed a relative measure ? 
  ( like km of railway / surface area country . ), 
  absolute number seem kinda pointless if the countries being compared are of such different scales . 
  by what measure is it perfect ? 
  could we start acting like we need a knowledge economy , rather than just saying we need a knowledge economy ? 
  ( increase education and research budgets rather than lowering them . 
  acknowledge and use science/rationality in politics . ), 
  life is unfair . 
  the world is unfair . 
  not everyone gets the same opportunities . 
  not everyone is able to fully exploit their opportunities . 
  most people who are unsuccessful are so because life dealt them a crappy hand . 
  could we please acknowledge this and try to make life a bit fairer ? 
  been googleing around , and the results seems largely to support your data . 
  however this article on the [ bbc ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8036097.stm ) contradicts it , their figures are from 2007 but i would n't expect the figures to change so drastically in 4 years . 
  wonder why that is . 
  damn , you 're right , they 're they have the [ 2nd highest gdp of the eu27 ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gdp+eu27 ) . 
  ( btw , i love wolframalpha ) . 
   france pays less than the netherlands , it is fourth what ?!, 
  the gdp of france is [ 3 times higher ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gdp+france+%2f+netherlands ) than ours !, 
  [ 16,755 km/h ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28distance+new+york+london+%2f+%281%2f3+hour%29%29 ) within reach mind you , it 's about ~ 4.6 km/s and the earth 's escape velocity is ~ 11 km/s ( though i 'm not sure if it could be sustained for 20 minutes ) . 
  brussels would be reached in [ ~ 70 sec ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28distance+london+brussel%29+%2f+4.6+km%2fsecv ) . 
  milk is for baby cows ( or baby humans in case of human milk ) . 
  teabag -  water ~ ~ -  milk . ~ ~ would be my preference . 
  forget the porn ban , this is even more ridiculous :  this follows a similar move by the parliament following an eu-wide citizen uproar over the antipiracy trade agreement , acta -- the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement -- in which comparable efforts by citizens saw their e-mails caught in the network 's spam filter . 
  emails from citizens filtered by a spam filter . 
  sorta surprisingly , for a party that is the result of a fusion of a pacifist party , communist party and 2 left-wing christian parties , greenleft is very down-to-earth . 
  have n't noticed any politicians , policies or active members who seem to support the kind of silliness you mentioned . 
  ( again lucky me . ), 
   anyway , if we could do something about the language barrier in europe things would probably look better . 
  it would be nice if we could get discussion on this subject on a european level . 
  compulsory lingua franca ( aka english ) education ? 
  probably would n't change that much in a good number of nations . 
  here in the netherlands english education starts during the last years of elementary . 
  ( and depending on the tier of your secondary education you may even end up learning 2 additional foreign languages and a dead one . ), 
   i 'll vote that until someone more moderate finally comes back to common sense . 
  guess i 'm quite lucky to have found a political party i can agree with ~ 90 % of the time , [ greenleft ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greenleft ) . 
  even became a member ~ 1 year ago . 
  went to a couple of meetings and a convention , quite interesting . 
  and a bit strange , sure i became a member during election season , and it 's a small party , but politics suddenly seems a lot less distant if you attend one of these events . 
  maybe i 'll volunteer during the 2014 eu elections , assuming i find the time . 
  i think i kinda agree with you . 
  too many parts of the eu seem quite undemocratic at the moment . 
  though on the other hand i 'd say that the one truly democratic part of the eu ( the european parliament ) does seem to function quite well . 
  a lot of the things recently passed ( the ones regarding internet privacy , animal testing , fishing , pesticides , etc ) seem quite good ( remember the porn thing was n't actual legislation , and i 'm not sure if it even passed ) . 
  europe could probably be turned federal without sacrificing democraticness , if the undemocratic parts ( mainly the commission ) were required to answer to the eu parliament . 
  ( similar to the minister-parliament relation a lot of the members states have going . ), 
  and it , the parliament , gets the power to actually propose legislation . 
  i do n't think the populace would fear federalization , as much as it does now , if it felt it is in control of europe . 
  of course not . 
  raeth seems to be suggesting that anti-discrimination laws should be at a local ( read municipal ) level . 
  which seems ridiculous to me . 
  ideally though laws will be at a level where they have popular support , are relevant , and are appropriate ( in terms of whether the legislative body at that level even has authority on the subject of the law in question ) . 
  issues only the dutch care about and have authority over should be handled at the dutch national level . 
  issues majority of europeans care about and the eu has authority over should be handled on a federal level . 
  ( and stuff only amsterdammers care about and amsterdam has authority over should be handled through a municipal ordinance . ), 
  personally though i think human-rights type laws ( anti-discrimination , freedom of ____ , gay-rights , etc ) should be handled at the highest level possible , so they affect the largest amount of people possible . 
  ah , that would alleviate some of the issues . 
  though i still would n't be in favour of it . 
  i do n't think we should allow institutionalized/legislated discrimination/bigotry to return to parts of our nations . 
  [ world population atlas ] ( http://www.worldpopulationatlas.org/ ) has a population cartogram of just [ the netherlands ] ( http://www.worldpopulationatlas.org/carto_nld.htm ) . 
  it 's not as bad as you suggest . 
  yes the randstad is pretty big ( i 'd say about 1/2 to 2/3rds of the map ) , but the rest is still present . 
  so let 's hope our governing bodies get the bloody message . 
  what would the limits of the local legislation be ? 
  what kind of punitive measure would they be allow to take ? 
  and who would execute these measures ? 
  would people be allowed to move freely between these regions ? 
  it still seems ridiculous to me . 
  it does n't seem desirable that a 20 min train/car/bike ride could lead me through multiple legislative zones , especially if laws that influence daily activities may vary . 
  some of which may even prohibit my very existence . 
  ( side note : i do n't think we should have to tolerate intolerance . ),
