  care to explain ? 
  ( i do n't think democracy in europe is n't in need of improvement , but i do think it possible to improve it . ), 
   the smaller or more personal topics get , things that effect individual 's day-to-day lives , i feel these laws should be set in as small an area as possible . 
  ideally down to city/town level . 
  people can choose to live in an area that suits their lives and their lifestyles . 
  could you give some examples of the kinds of laws you 're thinking about ? 
  cause i ca n't think of any that do n't make this idea sound ridiculous . 
  good luck proving your product is safe without referring to the actual test you did . 
  that 's true , and it is probably what he was implying , but the statement itself is without arrogance . 
  how is it arrogant ? 
  it 's the very definition of median !, 
  damnit , `` knowledge economy '' my ass . 
  greenleft is a blatantly pro-europe party , not satisfied with the status-quo . 
  granted they did n't do so well in the last elections ... 
  [ groenlinks.nl - tien voorstellen voor meer democratie in de europese unie ] ( http://europa.groenlinks.nl/node/95020 ) ( or the more in depth [ pdf ] ( http://europa.groenlinks.nl/files/groenlinks-meerdemocratieeu.pdf ) ) . 
  for the non dutch , greenleft ( small green leftwing progressive dutch political party ) , released this morning a document with 10 proposals to make the eu more democratic . 
  i 'll quickly translate the summary of the 10 proposals ( proposals 1 through 4 technically do not require a amendment of the european treaties ) :  1 . 
  president of the commission elected indirectly through the european elections . 
  all parties put forth their candidate , they should be part of a european wide campaign . 
  the candidate of the largest block in parliament gets to be president . 
  the democratically elected president will preside of both the council and the commission . 
  organize a public convention to determine the direction/future of the eu . 
  every country gets 2 representatives in this convention . 
  they 'll put together a new european treaty . 
  a ( preferably europe wide ) referendum to accept/reject the treaty put forth by the convention . 
  the european parliament will be able to change/reject economic reforms prescribed by the commission . 
  european citizens will be able to demand ( by collecting signatures ) a corrective referendum to accept/reject newly proposed european laws . 
  downsize the european commission . 
  commissioners get elected indirectly through european parliament elections ( presidential candidates should come with a team ) . 
  no longer should nationality be a requirement . 
  european parliament should be able to fire any commissioner on an individual basis . 
  if 1/6 national parliaments object to a proposed european law , the period in which objection can be raised should be increased . 
  ( at the moment they have 8 weeks . ), 
  european wide candidate lists in european elections . 
  til : chinese currency is called the renminbi . 
  i 'm no expert ( just skimmed the wiki page ) but how is failure to prevent a massacre a war crime ? 
  meh , we rank at about 10th in [ gdp per capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) . 
  are you referring to the `` police actions '' in indonesia ? 
  ( honest guess , i 'm pretty bad at dutch history . ), 
  [ percentage of people that say leisure time is very or quite important in their lives . 
  ] ( http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa.php?ids=4&amp;year=2008 ) oh lol , netherlands & greece sharing the nr 1 spot , with 96 % . 
  and quite right , leisure is important . 
  it 's from [ spiegel.de ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-growing-following-in-germany-the-dangerous-success-of-radical-young-clerics-a-816642.html ) , a photo of muslim youth in germany . 
  i 'm going to assume ( and a cursory glance seems to confirm it ) that the article is actually about the use of more natural methods when dealing with rivers . 
  like letting floodplains actually flood during a water crisis , letting them meander , etc. 
  rather than letting the sea back in . 
  i mean , if we let the sea back in , about ~ 5 of our provinces would be flooded . 
   yeah , which is why i did n't say majority . 
  while many does not equal majority , it sure as heck does n't suggest you 're referring to a minority . 
  ( for that you 'd need to use a word like few . ), 
  found [ this image ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/gdp_ppp_per_capita_2007_imf.png ) , gdp per capita adjusted for purchasing power , on the wiki page on [ purchasing power parity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity ) . 
  ( the data in the image is about 4 years old . ), 
  tl ; dr : the us style places more emphasis on working with the industry with things as consultations and voluntary frameworks . 
  the eu style is far more direct , * `` the eu prescribes its objectives and then commands the member states to deliver '' * , though consultations and such are part of the process . 
  i 'm no experts , but those points do make sense to me . 
  personally i 'm more worried about the recent trend of the us to try and deter eu developments regarding modern it laws . 
  the whole acta/pipa/sopa debacle , not to mention the recent stuff regarding the private data ownership stuff . 
  did n't they try to sneak stuff like that in through an eu-canada trade agreement ? 
  * `` never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity . 
  as far as i know it 's a theoretical concept . 
  ~ ~ the only ~ ~ a place that does n't happen is / r/science , because the mods remove the jokes . 
  act of desperation ? 
  and i 'm fairly certain the goal , in part , was to make those he deems responsible feel bad . 
  as other pointed out , long term unemployment fucks ( most ) people up . 
  yeah i expect that they wo n't make it through parliament . 
  but like happened with acta/sopa/pipa i would n't be surprised if they 're going to try again using different approaches . 
  it 's quite annoying that all these powerful/moneyed interest groups have so many ways to subvert what should be a democratic process . 
  who would be my mep ? 
  the ones i voted for ? 
  cause i 'm certain they are going to try and shoot it down anyway . 
   often in direct contrast to what the european commission has put forward , some of the new industry-proposed parliamentary changes include :   * eliminating explicit opt-in user consent to personal data  * letting corporations share personal data with any other entity that has a `` legitimate interest '' in that data  * disallowing citizens to access their own personal data `` in electronic form ''  * not requiring corporate `` data protection officers ''  * forbidding consumer groups from bringing lawsuits against corporations on behalf of individuals fuck . 
  what are they smoking ?!, 
  we would actually lose rights with that !, 
  could n't we get some kind of anti-lobbying petition going ? 
  the one about the bees seemed successful . 
  or to help out american tourist . 
  happens to the best of us . 
   we should stop asylum seekers . 
  do n't some asylum seekers deserve asylum on humanitarian grounds ? 
  the ones who 's lives would have been in immediate danger should they have stayed in their country of origin . 
  sure if you only regard the absolute figures you guys seem to be worse of . 
  shame absolute figures mean very little when dealing with countries of such different size as the netherlands and italy . 
  we get nearly twice as many asylum seekers per person than you guys do . 
  we get 30 % more asylum seekers per gdp than you guys do . 
  and we get 3.6 times as many asylum seekers per km ^ 2 than you guys do . 
  our problem is not smaller compared to our means than yours is , if anything it is larger . 
  and frankly , in the netherlands , there are a lot of people who bitch about asylum seekers too . 
  i just happen to be a bleeding heart left-wing environmentalist liberal . 
  ( alright got my definitions wrong , all asylum seekers are immigrants but not all immigrants are asylum seekers . 
  in the post above i was mainly concerned with non-asylum seeking immigrants . ), 
  not in the netherlands , i do n't really have a proper perspective on the situation in the rest of europe . 
  iirc the dutch asylum policy is relativly harsh compared to the rest of europe . 
  compare the figures between the netherlands and belgium ( 15k vs 30k ) . 
  [ statline eu-27 asylum requests in 2011 . 
  ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slen&amp;pa=80498eng&amp;d1=0&amp;d2=0,3-29&amp;d3=l&amp;la=en&amp;hdr=t,g2&amp;stb=g1&amp;vw=t ) as i said the system here in the netherlands is ( or at least used to be ) damn shitty . 
  it seems to be set up to deal with them with no compassion , minimizing expense at the cost of quality of integration . 
  i mean just look at [ mauro ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15533921 ) the way he was treated is just ridiculous . 
  somehow kids who manage to get integrated ( because the system sometimes takes half a decade to decide if you can stay or not ) do n't get to stay ( and it 's only about 1200 kids , but apparently human decency just factor into right-wing politics ) . 
  with regards to italy and the other border nations . 
  i think that asylum seekers should be dealt with on a european level ( or at least schengen-wide ) , so the problems and costs are shared between all countries not just the border nations .
