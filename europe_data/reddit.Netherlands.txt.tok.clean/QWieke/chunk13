  i 'd like to point out that immigrants are n't the same thing as asylum seekers . 
   your opinion on migration to europe . 
  as long as they can adapt to our values and can contribute to our society they ought to be welcome . 
  with priority/leniency to highly educated folks . 
   are you happy that there is `` multiculturalism '' ? 
  depends on your definition . 
  as long as they adapt to our core cultural values ( freedom of speech , religious freedom , freedom from discrimination , egalitarianism , right to property , secrecy of communication , unacceptability of violence , you know the basics ) everything should be fine . 
  the added variety to our cuisine , music , art , literature , etc is an enrichment to our society . 
   would you like it better if all immigration ceased ? 
  doubt it . 
  last year , in the netherlands , we had a net-gain of ~ 38k people from non-western countries . 
  it would probably be a gross injustice to assume that the majority of these people will be a detriment to our society . 
  though i do n't know how the dutch figures are compared to the rest of europe . 
   what do you think about the fact that the native european population is melting down while the immigrant families are having more children ? 
  is it a legitimate concern ? 
  nah not really . 
  it 's blown way out of proportion . 
   i recently red a survey that people from the uk vote immigration the biggest problem in their country . 
  lack of long term planning/view is what is really screwing us over . 
  the lack of investment/improvement in education , science and environmental protection is what really worries me . 
  i do n't know , i 'm not familiar with these laws hence me asking what 's objectionable about them . 
  ( though killing fish without fishing sounds pointless . ), 
  is n't that because all the politicians involved are elected on the national level and do n't have any obligations or stake in the countries they do n't represent ? 
  maybe if we get some of them elected by a europe wide election , so they really represent all ( or most ) of europe , we will get some proper european solidarity based politics . 
  in what way are they objectionable ? 
  that reminds me of [ this ] ( http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/binnenland/article/detail/3364411/2012/12/17/acteurs-tonen-discriminatie-in-uitzendbranche-aan.dhtml ) research , the social and cultural bureau of planning did some research in which actors actually went and visited job agencies . 
  surprising thing was that moroccans do n't seem to be discriminated against . 
  i would n't characterize the human genome project as a failure . 
  they managed to map the genome , however the benefits of mapping the genome were n't what we were expecting . 
  signed . 
  i like bees to exist , they 're pollinators . 
  second on the absolute scale , seventh on the relative scale , either seems quite charitable to me . 
  http://www.gatesfoundation.org/annual-letter/2010/publishingimages/11-net-aid-gdp-chart.gif edit : not saying the uk is n't one of the more charitable nations , i just prefer statistics that allow for population size or gdp . 
  wait what , i thought that was the joke . 
  yup . 
  we have a representative democracy . 
  what is the point of appointing those representatives anyway if with each major decision they turn to the populace and have them decide it ? 
  ah , thanks for explaining . 
   i assume they * mean average * height of adult males . 
  i assume because it is not stated in the infographic . 
  it took me a bit to long to realize you were n't just saying average twice . 
  i know how you feel ( 1.81 cm , so close ) ... 
  why should n't she deserve to retire and enjoy her pension/old-age , everyone else does . 
  she used to appoint the formateur during coalition talks , but they changed the rules lika a year ago or something ( last elections the formateur was appointed by parliament ) . 
  wait what according to wikipedia it goes william iii -  wilhelmina -  juliana -  beatrix , so only 3 queens in a row . 
  ( article tl ; dr : the goal is to have a massive number of hydrogen/electricity feul stations across europe by 2020 and to introduce standards regarding these stations ( plugs , hoses etc ) . ), 
  nice , imho , this is something everyone ( europhobes/philes alike ) would probably agree on is better handled on the european level . 
  good to see europe preparing for the future . 
  there are multiple standards within these regulations . 
  the minimum standards ( do not include curvature requirements ) he finds reasonable . 
  the quality standards ( what a high/medium/low-quality banana is ) he finds a bit silly . 
  fyi , speld.nl is a ( not as good ) dutch version of the onion . 
  i sincerely doubt that our current government will do anything about it , unless the international community applies significant pressure . 
  half of the ruling coalition consists of the vvd , our resident `` taxes are bad '' right wing party . 
  sounds like something that may be better handled on the european level anyway . 
  yeah sure , but i would n't be surprised if these kind of aesthetic regulations were created in the first place ( on the national level , at the behest of lobbies ) so the fruit & vegetable producers do n't have to deal with different regulations per store . 
  well the same blog mentions that the fruit & vegetable producing member states were actually against the removal of these regulations . 
  creating/increasing artificial scarcity did occur to me as a reason for why only the producing member states ( or rather the agricultural lobby within these states ) would be for these regulations . 
  but with regard to regulations in general , moving common regulations up to the european level would reduce paperwork/hassle for those companies that operate in multiple member states . 
   the ` straight banana ' thing did actually seem to be true , or at least , not for bananas , but for some other fruits and vegetables . 
  seeing as bananas are expected to be a bit curved would n't this , ironically , have led to the outlawing of straight bananas ? 
  :p seems like a good thing to cut down on these kinds of unnecessary regulations , though on the other hand :  but whenever i do search for * disgruntled manufacturers or exporters * unhappy about a planned eu directive standardising their product , i often find that the majority are * happy that there are europe-wide rules * , so they do n't have to have * legal teams and paperwork to meet 27 different national standards * . 
  from this [ blog ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markmardell/2008/11/rule_change_bears_fruit.html ) linked in the news article posted above . 
  it does make some sense to reduce paperwork international businesses have to deal with by having the regulations , those that happen to be nearly identical across member states , be managed on a european level . 
  fixed . 
  thanks , we should be fairly strict with the terminology in this subreddit . 
  ( so many different institutions that could be referred to as europe , not to mention the geographical area . ), 
  i did not expect us to be one of the most pro-eu countries . 
  ah yes , that makes sense . 
  then it would n't be `` my water well '' . 
  ( unless it is owned by the government and he only rents it or something . ), 
  if the water well is yours is n't it already private ? 
  do you have a source ? 
  [ racism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism )  racism is usually defined as views , practices and actions reflecting the belief that humanity is divided into distinct biological groups called races and that members of a certain race share certain attributes which make that group as a whole less desirable , more desirable , inferior or superior . 
  [ xenophobia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xenophobia )  xenophobia is a dislike or fear of people from other countries or of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange . 
  consider , a racist may hate/fear people of his own country but of a different race while a xenophobe may hate/fear people of a different country but of the same race . 
  no , you just have to request a new one at town hall . 
  ( it 's probably to keep the photograph up to date . ), 
  personally i would n't think it would be bad if people had to retake the exam once every while , just to ensure they are still capable of driving properly . 
   ** edit : ** no , it is n't . 
  oh crap , so this is n't exactly good news . 
  wait what , your license does not expire ? 
  the dutch ones do ( after 10 years ) . 
  most places ( at least here in the netherlands ) also have id cards . 
  you just do n't need one if you already got a driver 's license . 
  [ veolia water ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veolia_water ) and [ veolia transport ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veolia_transport ) have the same logo , and are both owned by veolia environment . 
  good idea , silly video , reminded me of [ qi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dqbc3efulu ) . 
  well , they are pretty similar , i actually googled french flag before replying to your post . 
  uhm , he/she 's dutch . 
  that 's a dutch flag , the french flag has the same colours but the bars are vertical instead of horizontal . 
  red = wine , brown = beer and blue = spirits ? 
  i 'm missing a legend . 
  do you still have to pay for it if you explicitly ask for tap-water ? 
  ( aka , kraanwater if you 're flemish . ), 
  side-note : i 'm pretty sure that this year a law got passed here in the netherlands that obliges heroca establishments to offer tap-water for free . 
   it allows them to be reimbursed who would reimburse them if they burn their own crops down ? 
  according to the ingredients list , it 's sugar in the netherlands . 
  from the article :  japan , which counts europe as a major export market , previously bought billions of dollars in bonds issued by the esm 's predecessor , the european financial stability facility . 
    `` stabilising europe 's financial crisis will eventually contribute to the stability of currency ( prices ) including the yen , and so we plan to keep purchasing esm bonds using foreign reserves , '' aso said tuesday . 
  frankly i mostly remember it being used jokingly or if a young child keeps asking for sweets and is too young to react to reasonable arguments .
