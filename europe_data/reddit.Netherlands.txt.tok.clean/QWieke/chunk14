  yeah but is n't `` wie vraagt wordt overgeslagen '' just used to shut up nagging children ? 
  found the original [ web post ] ( http://ask.metafilter.com/55153/whats-the-middle-ground-between-fu-and-welcome#830421 ) . 
  i think it boils down to whether people think it is okay to just decline a request ( they do n't in a guesser culture so just asking for something can put the other party in a awkward situation ) . 
  for example say a and b are friends and a wants to crash at b 's place for a night . 
  in an asker culture a would just ask b , after all they 're friends so no big deal right ? 
  in a guesser culture a would strike up a conversation with b , ask what b is up to the next couple of days , mention he will be in town , maybe even ask if b knows of any good places to stay and hopefully by then b would have gotten the hint and ask if a wants to stay over ( and if b mentioned earlier he 'll be busy the next couple of days a is expected to decline the offer politely ) . 
  let me answer this using 2 dutch proverbs/sayings . 
  '' * translation  * `` you 've got a no , you could get a yes . 
  '' *   * `` not shooting is always a miss . 
  ah cern of course , now i feel even better about the netherlands being 3d on % top papers published . 
  ( assuming i did n't overlook anyone . ), 
  would n't papers published per capita be more interesting than the absolute figures ? 
  ( though i guess the % top papers published is some indicator of relative quality . ), 
  ah that explains it . 
  shame though they did n't include a color for non-believers in the map . 
  i doubt the accuracy of the map . 
  iirc here , in the netherlands , catholicism is pretty much limited to north-brabant , zeeland and limburg . 
  the rest ( the majority ) of the nation is supposedly protestant . 
  like your list , especially the focus on scientist/writers/philosophers . 
  though i would include [ hendrik lorentz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hendrik_lorentz ) , he 's pretty much on-par with einstein ( he worked on special relativity with him ) . 
  edit : also why limit ourselves by using only one person per denomination ? 
  there are plenty of historical individuals who deserve to be on our money . 
  ( though i 'd leave out most politicians/nobility , focus on artist , scientists ( of both natural sciences and humanities ) , philosophers and maybe a couple of explorers . ), 
  artist from europe in my music library that i thought are worth mentioning : * ** belgium : ** deus , ghinzu , intergalactic lovers * ** france : ** daft punk , justice * ** germany : ** digitalism * ** iceland : ** m\u00fam , sigur r\u00f3s * ** sweden : ** the hives , royal republic * ** united kingdom : ** muse , editors , franz ferdinand , does it offend you yeah ? , the prodigy , 65daysofstatic , blackmill , bloc party , maybeshewill , mogwai , pendulum so yeah , i like british music . 
  ( only dutch band i found were de staat . ), 
   norway is not in the eu , so they get divided by 0 resulting in their freedom being so free it is undefined . 
  i 'm curious why this does n't go for russia , seeing as they 're not in the eu either . 
  well a lot of us simply do n't comment in such a situation . 
  maybe the laberours were thinking that ? 
  i 'm not saying it 's just pr . 
  i was trying to say that people often would rather do something than nothing in the face of a problem , even if the action taken is n't necessarily effective . 
  to make the politicians ( and the populace ) feel that they 're doing something to stop the terrorism ? 
  eh impossible , they did n't start construction for the building it 's in until [ 2002 ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/huygensgebouw ) . 
  i 'm actually there right now . 
  the [ studielandschap ] ( http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/565709/fnwistudielandschap-dva-159905web.jpg ) ( study landscape , directly translated ) at my university , it 's where i usually go to get something done . 
  well , that is , if i 'm not redditing . 
  was you first comment an actual quote from the game ? 
  i played it a fair bit but ca n't recall anything like that . 
  they should make a doctor who episode about it . 
  it does n't really mean anything in modern dutch , though the schip graveyard thing is one of the possible explenations of the name . 
  there appear to be a number of explenations ranging from `` swampy place where one can get wood '' to `` schip 's hell '' . 
  the [ afsluitdijk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afsluitdijk ) is 32 km long and supposedly only costs [ 40 million guilders ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/zuiderzeewerken#afsluitdijk ) ( ~ 18 million euros ) , to put things in perspective . 
  edit : though those are 1934 guilders , ca n't find the dutch inflation figures but assuming those are similar to the us infaltion figures it should be inflated by ~ 1700 % . 
  ( so 680 million guilders or ~ 300 million euros . ), 
  the [ open letter ] ( http://futureoflife.org/ai/open_letter_autonomous_weapons ) uses ( in my opinion ) fairly accessible language . 
  in the letter they do n't refer explicitly ( or implicitly ) to strong or weak ai . 
  it just appears to be concerned with autonomous weapons becoming ubiquitous and cheap . 
  resulting in them falling into the wrong hands . 
  personally i 'd also be a bit worried about strong ai because even though they 'd start out with weak ai i 'd expect such an ai arms race to inevitably lead to strong ai . 
  i 've seen people express a fundemental issue with machines being able to decide when to kill someone and that being a major argument against autonomous weapons . 
  this is something that does n't worry me that much in the case of drones and such . 
  however a world where every petty criminal can get his or her hands on one is worrysome ( though somewhat inevitable imho ) and in the letter this is suggested to be a expected result from an ai arms race . 
  the arms race would cause autonomous weapons to become cheap and plentifull . 
  but what i find to be most worrisome about an ai arms race is that it probably would n't be limited to drones and weapons but that it would also extend to potentially far more intelligent systems . 
  drones and such have a limited potential ( and usefull ) intelligence . 
  but say support ai used in cyber warfare , intelligence gathering and other military support could use all the intelligence it can get . 
  which is why i 'd expect this arm race to extend to artificial general intelligence ( human like ai ) and perhaps even seed ai ( superintelligent ai ) . 
  these things are potentially really dangerous and i do n't think the race conditions inherent in an arms race lend for a safe and sensible development of these technologies . 
  developing these technologies requires a great deal of restraint and carefullness , something you wo n't have if you 're afraid the russans/americans/chinese / whatever might get there first . 
  sweet , i actually recognize 2 of my fellow ai grad students and 5 professors . 
  just signed it as well , autonomous weapons do n't worry me that much , though an ai arms race does . 
  yeah , i 'm not sure what else besides light pollution would influence something like this . 
  average eyesight quality ? 
  amount of tree coverage ? 
  number of public observatories ? 
  edit : altitude !, 
  i kid you not my sister did n't know ( or realize ) that this was due to the eu . 
  / r/papgrappen is that way . 
  no problem . 
   optical ( digital ) gimmicks i think cosmetic is the word usually used here . 
  maybe it was premature , though i feel like ( largely unsubstantiated , do n't have the time to look things up now , but i vaguely recall something like this being the case with the introduction of the euro ) that a lot of the problems with the eu are a result of a lot of half-hearted implementations of eu plans , where the member states try to get all the benefits without any of the perceived drawbacks ( mostly loss of sovereignty , which is bull imho ) . 
  like the whole freedom of movement combined with an asinine and unfair refugee policy thing , or a monetary union without a proper fiscal union , etc. 
  the '' [ my voice counts in the eu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sph8pwu.png ) '' chart is a bit odd , i ca n't help but feel that the results of that poll are n't completely in line with how i 'd estimate the actual power distribution in the eu . 
  ( for example , we , the dutch , are higher up in that chart than both germany , france and the uk . ), 
  personally i would also argue that some kind of singleton could be desirable and that the eu is an interesting test case . 
  good point , had n't thought of it that way . 
  i wonder how high it could be pushed . 
  edit : also what with all the euroskeptic parties calling for various stages of dissolution of the eu one might even argue that people have been trying to sell people on the opposite . 
  you do realise that combined with arctorkovich 's post this is a massive spoiler ? 
  would you ? 
  well that ai n't the picture linked cause greece is in between them in that one . 
  i was considering `` like '' in a broader sense than `` seems like a nice guy '' though . 
  our pm seems like a nice enough guy but i do n't like him at all , his politics are just awful . 
   whether he visits an atm or not is inconsequential to the greek economy i 'm pretty sure the finance minister wasting time in a crisis would be good for their economy . 
  also i did n't have any lag ( that i noticed ) on the bloomberg site . 
  edit : i just realized i did n't really watch it , just listened , so grains of salt are to be had with the above statement . 
  interesting , seems quite reasonable . 
  i think i like him better than the people in my own government , though that 's hardly a compliment . 
  prodigy of what one might ask ? 
  well maybe we should try to find a way to do without . 
  that we we might also deal with the global warming problem . 
  two birds with one stone and such . 
   it 's also banned though right now ... really ? 
  i have no ( polite ) words . 
  if all those numbers were 0 % it 'd be pretty hard to wage war , which does n't strike me as a bad thing . 
  yup , `` vader '' is dutch for father , `` darth '' however is n't a word in dutch . 
  which is really ironic since wilders is most certainly part of the `` haagse elite '' , he first became a member of the tweed kamer back in 1998 making him one of the longest sitting members . 
  he 's just your standard issue populist/nationalist politician pandering to the gut feeling of the most common denominator without actually trying to be constructive or offering any real solutions . 
  i assume from how `` prepared at home '' is used that in this scenario the person is going to do a presentation and already finished creating the powerpoint . 
   also , this powerpoint i prepared at home with mom 's computer is totally messed up =( export to pdf people , for crying out loud .
