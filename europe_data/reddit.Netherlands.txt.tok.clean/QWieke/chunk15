  how about an [ electro version ] ( https://soundcloud.com/aleksander-vinter/savant-ode-to-joy-free ) from norwegian origin ? 
   the stars gained weight . 
  which , just like in humans , shortens their lifespan . 
  humans do n't get any brighter when heavier though . 
  \\* looks at polls \\* never gon na happen , wish it would though . 
    maybe we 'd better try and make sure they do n't have to start these journeys   so its europe 's responsibility to make the whole world safe ? 
  no but if it is an effective way of mitigating the immigrant we should probably do it anyway . 
  ( not to mention other potential benefits and it potentially being quite ethical . ), 
  [ kinda ? 
  ] ( https://appdb.winehq.org/objectmanager.php?sclass=version&amp;iid=25823 ), 
  eh , i could n't be bothered with it . 
  it 'd just be more work for me , my brain is in english-mode most of the time anyway , it 's not as if i compose these comments in dutch in my head first , i 'd just end up translating my english thoughts to dutch rather than the other way around . 
  plus half the time i would n't even be sure how to properly translate the english to dutch , the first line of this comment for example would that be * `` eh , teveel werk . 
  '' * or something ? 
  does n't australia have a far worse prime minister / president than we have ? 
  i 'm pretty sure their politics is more nuts that ours atm . 
  where to then ? 
  jup , the [ flynn effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flynn_effect ) . 
  and then you realise that education has n't really changed all that much in the last century , wonder how far we 'll go once scientific/evidence based educational methods pop up . 
  from the frontpage of / r/science today : * [ older adults today show higher levels of cognitive functioning and well-being than older adults of the same age 20 years ago . 
  this has been found in a collaborative study among several research institutions .

  in which case the `` disincentivize defection '' argument props up , maybe they do n't want to make it profitable for countries to leave the eu ? 
  but humans do n't act according to game theory , take the [ ultimatum game ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultimatum_game ) for example . 
  edit : plus some argument could be made that if the eu ought to disincentivize defection . 
  yep , not to mention that they were just about to start to get anywhere with the martians and their artifacts . 
  just finished rereading feet of clay this morning , the timing is a coincidence i started rereading the watch books a couple of days before terry 's death ( because of a reference to colon and nobby in [ hpmor ] ( http://www.hpmor.com ) ) . 
  the only puns that i can remember where the horrible puns put on coat of arms , though i suspect there may have been more playing with language in the book that i do n't remember at the moment ( or did n't recognize ) . 
  next up , jingo , i `` m already looking forward to the ending vimes & carrot are badasses . 
   my last books were the takeshi kovcacs series ( god , was i sad when i finished those ) finished reading woken furies a couple of weeks ago , thought it ended on somewhat of an up-note , at least compared to the rest of the book . 
  tough i am disappointed that the story ends when the world is on the verge of revolution . 
   strange times ; what do you think of the eu ? 
  heavily in favor , first unify europe then the world . 
  i think we as humanity , need some kind of political union , some kind of global government , in order to deal with the new realities of globalization ( the race-to-the-bottom `` competitiveness , the whole tax-haven thing , etc ) and deal with possible existential threats ( global warming , asteroids , pandemics , etc ) . 
  that 's not to say that everything needs to be dealt with from a global perspective but that there are some things that can only be effectively dealt with from such a perspective . 
  plus i like the idea of not having to use wars to solve conflicts , would be nice if we could manage that . 
  same here . 
  our mayor , while opening an eu election debate , actually claimed that the national governments ought to be disbanded and their duties transfered to the eu or the municipalities and i find myself agreeing with him . 
  regardless of whether they 're complete shitshows they are quite obsolete in the eu . 
  i 'm not sure what the us financial system has to do with it , it 's just a reorganization of a subset of our current social policies . 
  it 's funny the national government is saddling the municipalities with a lot of extra problems ( by handing them more responsibilities while cutting their budgets , part of their austerity program ) causing them to become more pragmatic and progressive . 
  i 'm actually , partially by nature , cautiously optimistic . 
  at least there are a not insignificant number of people in our legislative branch that represent my point of view . 
  and there are even two parties in parliament which advocating doing experiments with unconditional basic income greenleft and d66 , the latter of which is even leading some polls ( it enjoys significant support from pvda and sp members but no actual official support of these parties ) . 
  lisa westerveld , a local gl politician who 's working to set up such an experiment her city , has publicly stated she expects the netherlands to have some form of ubi within the next 10 years , so who nows ? 
  would be nice . 
  the next elections are going to be interesting . 
  anything for economic growth !, 
  people need jobs !, 
  there is no such thing as structural unemployment !, 
  etc, 
  actually the dutch were always right wing in my opinion . 
  either the cda , vvd or one of their predecessors were always part of the kabinet . 
  ( [ well at least as far back as the 50s ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/historische_zetelverdeling_tweede_kamer ) ), 
  it 's get even worse in monospace : raketenwissenschaftler raketwetenschapper, 
  greenleft , i 'm even a member though i do n't have the time to actually be active within the party . 
  though i would n't be that upset if i had to vote for any of the other left-wing parties ( wel except for the pvda at the moment , because they 're a bunch of vvd-enablers ) . 
   i feel that most of the mainstream parties in europe are at best moderate democrats with their willingness to give in ... all in the name of `` competitiveness . '', 
  do n't forget about `` austerity '' , `` balancing the budget '' and `` 3 % of gdp deficit '' , but you 're probably right there , on the average we lean a bit more to the left but not that much . 
   what is even sadder is how much your countries ' governments and especially the eu kiss up to it . 
  europe does n't need any gangsters , be they putin , ` merica , or netanyahu , to protect it . 
  we 're a bit too fragmented to effectively stand up to the other big powers , it 's one of the reasons i 'm in favor of federalization . 
  though i do n't really hear any europeans seriously claiming we need other powers to protect us , that , to me , seems to be more of an american meme . 
  it 's more the district system + fptp that leads me to say there is little point in voting in the states , not necessarily the corruption ( though that certainly does n't help ) . 
  districts system with fptp effectively enforces a 2 party system ( we 've all seen the [ cgp grey video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7twhjfhiyo ) ) and stifles any minority political opinion . 
  i 'm exaggerating a bit , i 'd probably still vote ( if only to keep the republicans out of office , they 're horrid ) assuming it 's not too much hassle . 
  though compared to the dutch situation where i can actually vote for a party i actually agree with rather than voting for a party that i do n't really like but is not as bad as the one other option , the situation in the us is really sad . 
  also since when are `` schap '' and `` schip '' synonyms ? 
   you finally are starting to understand why our political climate is such shit a horrible electoral system that only barely qualifies as democratic ? 
  i mean having first past the post , a district system and an electoral college already results in a bad system but then this is combined with horrible campaign financing laws , gerrymandering , voter suppression and such leading to something that , from a dutch perspective , just is n't really democratic . 
  so i 'm not sure if i 'd vote if i were an american ( probably not ) , mathematically there 's not much point to it and philosophically i 'm not sure if i 'd even want to validate the system by participating in it . 
   which might result in them actually sticking with the pvv or the sp when close to the ballot box . 
  in that case i have a strong preference for the sp , although i would n't be caught dead voting for them myself , at least then some kind of ( center - ) left coalition is feasible , instead of all the center right stuff we have been having lately . 
   with the political center being shattered in the crossfire . 
  eh is n't d66 doing pretty well in the polls ? 
  luckily some of the more detailed research/polls into pvv voters shows that it really is a protest vote and that the voters themselves do n't expect real solutions from geert , all they want is to give the mainstream political parties a wake up call ( why they ca n't do this while voting for a more sensible non-mainstream party is beyond me ) . 
  i would n't be surprised if polls shift away from the pvv when we get closer to actual elections , when people are n't just sending the politicians a signal . 
  did n't know that 's how the eu works . 
  yeah , politicians can ( or at least should be able to ) deal with the rhetoric of other politicians . 
  jim jefferies is awesome . 
  yeah i sure as fuck am not going to drink it in order to get drunk . 
  have you ever met drunk people ? 
  they 're fucking idiots . 
  see the thing is that it is n't just the taste of beer or wine that is horrible , it is the taste of alcohol itself . 
  i have tried various alcoholic beverages and while some of them seem inoffensive at first they always end up having an alcoholicy after taste that i do n't like . 
  admittedly ciders do sound like i 'd like them better than the vast majority of other alcoholic beverages . 
  though it still kinda sounds like you 're ruining perfectly good fruit juice by fermenting it . 
  fuck i do n't drink alcohol ^ * , does that mean i 'm less free ? 
  ^ * ^ i ^ do n't ^ like ^ the ^ taste . 
  oh yeah , there 's no denying he 's popular . 
  a lot of that is due to people lying on the polls . 
  they claim they 'll vote for wilders in order to send the other politicians a message . 
  odd i do n't see any flying pigs outside . 
  it 's not that much of a stretch given how isis and such have been treating various historical and cultural artefacts in the middle east . 
  ah so your a nature over nurture kind a guy ? 
  and pray tell where do violent fuckwits come from ? 
  how are they created ? 
  that 's just / r/shitamericanssay . 
  and there is the stereotype i could do without . 
  for the non dutch speakers among us .
