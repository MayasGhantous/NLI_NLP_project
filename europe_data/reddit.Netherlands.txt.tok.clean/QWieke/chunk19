  or are you really that ignorant ? 
  the reason freedom of movement is one of the fucking cornerstones of the european union is literally to prevent war . 
  the whole goddamn point of this freedom is to get the populations of the eu to mix and foster a sense of brotherhood and familiarity so we would refuse to kill each other . 
  dickhead politicians in the past could easily rile people up against foreigners because the vast majority of them they never fucking travelled and never actually met those foreigners , they would n't realise that those foreigners are basically just like them . 
  so getting the people of europe to know each other , by granting them free movement was one of the many things the creators of the eu institutions did to prevent war * . 
  but do n't take my word on it [ just look at this article by the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33655318 ) . 
  -- * : or do you think the whole trade thing is just for economic reasons ? 
  that it 's just a wild coincidence that mere years after the second world war the first european institution created was the european coal and steel community ? 
  an institution that just happens to provide a common market for and supranational oversight on the two resources absolutely essential for a war at the time ? 
  if the troika were sensible about money and debt they would 've allowed the greeks to restructure it and not force them to take new loans to pay the old ones . 
  yeah cause european membership is forced . 
   but when someone like merkel invites millions of migrants into the eu , without anyone else having a say . 
  then i think its a broken system , and would be a reason to leave that system . 
  the sensible way to solve this issue , in my opinion , would be to move responsibility for immigration ( and probably foreign affairs ) up to the european level . 
  preferably through some kind of minister appointed by the european parliament . 
  after all if these things ca n't be handled by the national governments , because all of the eu should have a say , it should be handled by the eu government . 
  however this would never happen since it would constitute a `` loss of sovereignty '' or something . 
  but you do n't appear to know how capitalization works . 
   hold the mp 's hands as those are mostly 2nd and 3rd grade politicians being sent from their home coutnries as either a form of reward or a form of keeping tabs on dangerous opponents . 
  maybe we ought to send some better politicians then . 
  til that :  to prevent shit like ww1 and ww2 from repeating , to have a political structure that can be used to solve transnational issues in europe and so we stand stronger together on the international political stage . 
  are just `` ideological '' reasons with no practical value whatsoever . 
  because if they get all the benefits ( with associated costs ) they 'd just be a member ? 
  and if they can get just pick and choose some of the benefits then that undermines the idea of a tightly interwoven and interdependent union which is the whole point of the eu in the first place . 
  you know , to prevent shit like ww1 and ww2 from repeating , to have a political structure that can be used to solve transnational issues in europe [ edit ] and so we stand stronger together on the international political stage [ / edit ] . 
  eh , i 'd rather not give the idiots in our country a chance to ruin it . 
  i like democracy but it has to be an informed choice and the arguments from the nexit side show that they 're about as uninformed as one could get . 
  ( though recent polls suggest that 64 % of the netherlands is in favour of staying in the eu . 
  but 54 % against having a referendum . ), 
  there is no vice prime minister or something ready to take over ? 
  lotta people seem to dislike statistics though . 
  if my stats class at uni was any indication . 
   with the british tier being trade and free movement of goods , services and capital , but not movement . 
  i , and many other people , would take issue with allowing the free movement of capital , goods and services while not allowing people to do the same . 
  there already is a massive power difference between capital and labour , allowing the former to move freely from country to country while the latter can note only further exacerbates this difference . 
  not to mention that the freedom of movement for people thing has been an important part of both the european economic area and the european free trade association , the only countries that got a real exemption are ( afaik ) ireland and the uk . 
  ( romenia and bulgaria do n't either , but i 'm pretty sure that 's just temporary . ), 
  also the netherlands moving down to the trade tier would be basically be a nexit . 
  and if this no-free-movement trade tier existed it would embolden the heck out of our current euroskeptics , they 're like the brexit people , they want the trade but not the politics . 
  i mean in principle i would n't have a big problem with two such tiers , as long as we end up in the federation . 
  though i 'm a bit unclear on what the difference between efta and this trade tier would be ( except that efta has free movement of people ) . 
  ultimately i do n't think the uk and dutch euroskeptics are that different , blame the eu , blame immigrants , moan about sovereignty , claim the eu should only be about economic cooperation . 
  and our politics is n't that different with regard to the eu either . 
  ** [ ranty ] ** if the eu does something unpopular blame them , if the eu does something popular claim responsibility for yourself . 
  send your worst political candidates to the european parliament . 
  moan about a democratic deficit conveniently forgetting that that which is n't determined by the european parliament is determined by some body of people appointed by the national governments . 
  moan about sovereignty the moment the european parliament wants to function a bit more like the dutch parliament does . 
  ** [ / ranty ] ** except maybe our internal politics is a bit more pragmatic and compromise based ( kinda necessary what with having 16 different parties in parliament ) . 
  that 's the biggest difference , i do n't think our politics would allow for a referendum on the eu . 
  and if it still managed to happen somehow ( maybe through a popular initiative like the ukraine thing ) then no party would say they 'd follow the advise ( we do n't have binding referenda , they 're all advisory here ) . 
  honestly i do think that the dutch ( and maybe euroskeptics in general ) would have a lot less trouble with the eu if it functioned more transparently , with better media coverage ( it 's practically zero now ) and if there were less people appointed by the national governments ( that all just reeks of backroom politics ) . 
  maybe this whole brexit thing will provide the motivation for the eu to do some proper reforms . 
  to incentive them to stay ? 
  which would n't work if the incentives to stay can be easily be obtained when you leave ? 
  ah yes , play all parties off against each other . 
  makes some sense . 
  well i doubt they 'd be much happier if we had kept a couple of tanks near the north sea when the russians ground forces roll over their border . 
  plus we have planes and boats and stuff , we just stopped doing the tank thing . 
  for crying out loud our military budget is 8.1 billion compared to the fin 's 2.6 billion and we have about 5 times the number of active military personnel . 
  we do . 
  but if we start giving ex-members easy access to those incentives ( like , say , the common market ) it kinda defeats the whole point , no ? 
  more justifications to bitch about the eu ? 
  he 's suggesting that the ones who new better where working or something and could n't therefore vote hence the older voters being skewed towards brexit . 
  cause dumb people are unemployed and it 's impossible to vote on a work day . 
  doing what the people claim is good for them is just pure populism . 
  but i do suspect that these people feel like they 're not being listened to . 
  problem is that fear and simple solutions are a lot easier to communicate than complex reality . 
  well i would prefer it if the trade deal would n't be so good as to embolden the nexit elements in our politics . 
  at the moment there seems to be no realistic argument to be made in favour of a nexit economically . 
  wilders and geenpeil are insufferable enough as it is , i shudder to think how bad they 'd become if the uk gets a nice trade deal . 
  but a trade deal is ultimately in everyone 's best interest ( heck i 'd prefer it if the uk stayed a full member ) though the eu does it 's have internal political stability to consider . 
  we sold them to the fins . 
  they 're still in the eu and a heck of a lot better at fighting the russian than we are . 
  so you complain about `` wut ? '', 
  voters and just happen to mention , with no relation between the two , that half the population are below average intelligent ? 
  cause your whole comment just reads as the standard issue `` the problem with democracy is stupid and/or ignorant people '' type comment . 
  i sincerely doubt it would ever escalate to those levels . 
  and if another member state decides to leave , the harm of losing all benefits of membership , would also be their own doing . 
  the eu is n't saying that they 'll hurt members that leave . 
  they 're saying that members that leave should n't expect a nice parting gift . 
  oh please , be more dramatic . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/threat ) :  a threat is a communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another person . 
  all the loss or harm currently being inflicted on the uk is completely their own doing . 
  they choose to leave the eu and give up all the benefits , costs and responsibilities that come with it . 
  they have chosen to give up access to the common market . 
  sure they intend to try and get it back through some kind of trade deal . 
  but the eu telling the uk that it does not intend on giving them a particularly awesome deal does not constitute a threat . 
  the harm has already happened by their own hand , the eu simply intends to reverse less of it than they could have . 
   well it 's not my quote , but i see r/europe is happy to downvote me anyway . 
  though you at least think it 's worth repeating , but that 's hardly a good reason to downvote . 
  frankly the way the bit you quoted is phrased makes it sound like a one-liner designed to rile people up against he eu to me . 
  which is hardly unsurprising given the context . 
  there is a bit of a spectrum between utterly crap exploitative trade deal and super duper friendly awesome trade deal . 
  i doubt the final deal will be utter horrible but i do expect that , on paper , it will be worse than full membership . 
  though depending on how much the uk value independence it could still be decent deal overall . 
  it is n't in the eu 's interest to confirm the claims of some euroskeptics that a country could just leave , get a trade deal , and be better off economically . 
  that depends entirely on the kinds of incentives used . 
  i doubt the eu is going to use it 's non-existing military to intimidate the uk . 
  why though ? 
  what do you expect to change making it more opportune to trigger it then rather than now ?
