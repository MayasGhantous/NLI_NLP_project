  [ here 's the dutch site ] ( http://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/themaoverstijgend/programmas_en_formulieren/aangifteprogramma_2013_linux ) and [ here 's the english site ] ( http://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/themaoverstijgend/applications_and_forms/tax_return_program_2013_for_non_resident_taxpayers_digid ) , i think they 're actually different programs , one for resident tax returns the other for non-residents . 
  nice thing is they even support linux !, 
  these jokers get 1.5 million signatures while the basic income initiative only gets 0.28 million ?!, 
   voluntary group or by a rich man if we did things that way a lot less would get done . 
  oh yes , but giving the most important websites you use a unique and strong password should n't be that difficult . 
  and ideally you should n't use the same password on multiple websites . 
  ( well at least the really important ones should have a unique password . ), 
  but surely people do n't start to commit murder just because there are fewer cops around ? 
  that is bloody excellent . 
  although i 'm wondering if this wo n't just result in doing their trails elsewhere , i do n't know how mobile such endeavors are . 
  i probably will , seems interesting . 
  sure but asking will get me a link endorsed by a fellow redditor :d . 
   got some funky effects on the environment when used en masse - look at denmark and their fog/mist-forming got a link ? 
  cause that sounds interesting . 
  cause the political parties in power are known for their green agenda ... no wait they totally are n't . 
   lets just keep plomping down windmills to be fair windmills are , just like waterworks , quintesentially dutch . 
  though i 'd rather see us use both , afaik it 's pretty hard to meet base load with windmills ( what with it not being windy 24/7 ) . 
  \\* looks at gap between 2012 use and 2020 target . \\* yeah , that 's never gon na happen . 
  damn our politicians , and damn our electorate . 
  problem is it 's sunny as hell right now , i can barely open my eyes outside out of fear of getting blinded . 
  so it 's not all right . 
  aha , well rather unsurprising that i thought you may have gotten them confused . 
  that 's insanity , kinda unsurprising in hindsight but utterly insane non the less . 
  austrians not australians , ( unless austrians are a lot more like australians than i thought ) . 
  well i 've never tried it , it might work :p, 
  indeed , there is something quite exhilarating about going fast under your own power . 
  if i remember correctly the fastest i got when driving to school once was ~ 32 kmph , well the fastest i got while i still had a functioning speedometer on my bike . 
  having said that every time i have fallen ( like ~ 4 times ) it was while driving really slowly due to sleet . 
  eh , i 'm a bit skeptical , evidence based approach to political policy is hardly popular , i think most politicians rather 'd do what 's popular than what 's effective . 
  or perhaps it does n't even occur to them that their policy of choice may not be particulary effective and that such things can be measured empirically . 
  for example here in the netherlands 6.5 * 10 ^ 9 euros is spent on programs that are supposed to improve labour participation ( not sure if that is an appropriate way to put it in english ) while in reality it barely has any ( if any ) benefit , it 's pretty much a waste of money , yet no politician would dream of suggesting that these programs be scrapped , that 'd just make it look as if you 're soft on `` laziness '' . 
  ( [ here ] ( https://decorrespondent.nl/754/het-failliet-van-de-nederlandse-werklozenindustrie/28987530-054a9ebb ) is the article i 've got these numbers from , however i 'm afraid it is in dutch though some of the sources in lists may not be . ), 
  no , only if the cost of controlling these abuses is less than what we save by controlling these abuses . 
  ( but that obviously goes for abuses/inefficiencies/etc in general , no point in spending 20 bucks in order to save 10 . ), 
   born : angela dorothea kasner , 17 july 1954 ( age 59 ) [ merkel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angela_merkel ) sure as hell did n't have anything to do with that , same goes for most current germans . 
  apperantly a lot of people are [ filing complaints with the om ] ( http://nos.nl/artikel/625855-om-krijgt-aangiftes-tegen-wilders.html ) as well , it 's going to be interesting to see how this all turns out . 
  edit : i know he was put on trail in 2011 for similar stuff though it appears he has gone further this time , at least a lot of people claim so , and the public outcry seems greater as well . 
  sounds like the [ fundamental attribution error ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fundamental_attribution_error ) to me , which seems to make some sense given the us 's higher focus on individualism . 
   but deep down i bet most ethnic dutch want less moroccans in their country as an ethnic dutch person , fuck off and do n't tell me how i feel . 
  well dispite everything socialism is still pretty strong in the netherlands . 
  by that logic we might as well start kicking out [ the native dutch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkert_van_der_graaf ) as well . 
   but it also promotes racism within the netherlands . 
  do n't we have laws against that kind of stuff ? 
  we sold all our tanks to finland last year , budget cuts etc. 
   russia is conducting previously planned military exercises on it 's eastern border . 
  should n't that be western border ? 
  assuming the russians are doing exercises in europe not in asia . 
  note that those two are still part of schengen , and i 'm fairly certain wilders has said he 'd also want to close our borders again . 
  i 'm not quite sure what you 're point is . 
  there are some flaws in the eu , so we should just abandon the whole thing ? 
  not try to improve it , like what 's happening during the next eu elections , just abandon it ? 
  i do n't know , i googled around a bit for information on why wilders is popular . 
  * [ 200 page book on why people vote for wilders from 2012 ] ( http://achterdepvv.com/achter-de-pvv/ ) ( link to [ pdf ] ( http://achterdepvv.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/chris-aalberts-achter-de-pvv.pdf ) ) * [ nrc article from 2009 ] ( http://vorige.nrc.nl/opinie/article2319287.ece/hierom_stemmen_steeds_meer_mensen_pvv ) * [ nwo article from 2013 ] ( http://www.nwo.nl/actueel/nieuws/2013/magw/vrouwen--en-homorechten-niet-belangrijk-voor-kiezers-pvv.html ) all of them seem to suggest ( granted i skipped to the end of the book ) that the main reason why people vote pvv are his viewpoints on the multicultural society ( or foreigners , maroccans and islam ) . 
  though they also seem to suggest that quite a large fraction of pvv supporters do n't actually believe in wilder 's solutions and basically hope to spur the other parties into action by treatening to vote pvv . 
  so i have some hope that these polls are n't actually representative of the real voting behavior of these people . 
   but in the end pvv is the only euroskeptical platform speaking out against excessive regulations passed down from brussels . 
  i would definitly include that among his bad points . 
  and he is n't just against `` excessive regulations '' , he wants the netherlands to leave the eu in it 's entirety , which is pure insanity . 
   and if the guy needs bodyguards just because of speaking his mind he ca n't be all that wrong in my opinion . 
  that make no sense , just because you 're pissing off bad people does n't make what you 're doing actually right . 
  meh , i bet you 're going to find at least some valid points in most of the party platforms in the netherlands . 
  just because they have it in the platform does n't mean they actually care that much about it . 
  i rarely , if ever , hear wilders say anything that is n't bitching about foreigners or the eu , granted i do n't pay him any attention . 
  not to mention that what few good points he makes are utterly dwarfed by the magnitude of his bad points . 
  are n't there microusb cables that only have the power wires ? 
  so no actual data can be exchanged . 
  [ why abandon a winning strategy ? 
  ] ( http://www.allepeilingen.com/ ) in related news i think i might actually dispise about 1/3 of the dutch electorate . 
  relevant [ what-if xkcd ] ( http://what-if.xkcd.com/17/ ) !, 
  i 'm pretty sure there were more mods but the jerk removed them during his/her outburst . 
  some of them yes , however in most cases handling these things from at and eu level seems more convenient with regards to things like international trade ( it 's a lot more convenient/efficient for the food industry to label stuff if al eu nations require the same labels ) and other effects that trancend national borders ( like the environmental issues ) . 
  well i do n't own a television so that 's my only option anyway . 
  eh , laws can be changed . 
  sounds like a good reason to hold elections on a sunday . 
  i like the scale they 're using . 
  `` insane whopper '' , `` rather daft '' , `` 50/50 '' , `` almost '' , `` true, 
  but one can hope . 
  ( i mean think of the stuff we could learn if we could create black holes ! ), 
  did not know about google.com/ncr , thanks , i 'm always annoyed when i end up at the dutch google page . 
  mmm , when i type in `` why is the netherlands '' i get : * why is the netherlands called the netherlands * why is the netherlands called holland * why is the netherlands so rich * why is the netherlands the best country no `` why is the netherlands orange '' , and i 've got google search history , personalisation disabled and removed all google cookies before trying this , so i should n't have a search bubble . 
  sure it 's better than no cuts to co2 emissions , but it is still not enough . 
  how ? 
   would have been so cash . 
  i think you mean `` pecunia '' . 
  you do realise sarcasm is often conveyed using body language and tone of voice right ? 
  things that does n't translate well to written text . 
   the registration is painless : doctors will draw some blood . 
  [ according to the dutch site ] ( http://www.europdonor.nl/donor/na-de-aanmelding/ ) they do n't even need to draw blood , a simple swab test is sufficient ( they 'll mail you the swab so you can just do it at home ) . 
  i registered by the way , cause i why the hell not * . 
  edit : * by which i mean that i weight the pros and cons and decided that it would be ethically objectionable not to register . 
   i seldom see seriously obese people . 
  yeah but it is n't just the seriously obese that count , regular obese is obese enough . 
  class i obesity does not require all that much , [ there is a mere 10 percentage points difference in the body fat percentage of normal and obese people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/body_fat_percentage ) . 
  i mean if i manage to lose 10 kg of body fat , i 'll drop from 26 % to 18 % , from low-end obese to low-end average . 
  it really is not just the clearly fat people who are obese , heavy set with a little bit of gut is often enough ( and easily obfuscated through baggy clothing ) . 
  not my mom that 's for sure . 
  she 'd cook it for 10 minutes and then forget the salt . 
  not that i agree with alarmist politicians * , but just because we 're the best in the world does n't mean we should n't try to be even better . 
  i mean we got ta stay ahead of the scandinavians do n't we ? 
  * : unless they 're being alarmist about things i myself am also concerned about of course .
