  probably refers to a blank vote . 
  blank and white are the same word in french ( blanc ) . 
   heck , we barely trust them . 
  which is far more trust than is reasonable . 
   also i would like to see some proof that putin made a financial deal with wilders ( pvv , netherlands populist party ) . 
  do n't we have proof he 's being funded ( in part ) by americans ? 
  donations are a type of funding . 
  that 's a distiction without a difference . 
  ( not to mention that whatever money the russians might give would also fall under donations . ), 
  thanks !, 
   duckduckgo is not recomended anymore . 
  why ? 
   also , is the us financing right wing parties across europe ? 
  no its russia . 
  i know it 's in dutch but [ wilders is known to have received donations from us sources . 
  i 'm all for it but would n't that take away power from the national governments ? 
  the very people who have to sign off on giving away that power ? 
   yeah , you did mention it was 2014 . 
  i did n't , i edited after i saw your comment . 
  i wonder if we just have been drawing in less eu subsidies or something . 
  previous years we were paying about the same as the uk in relative terms ( ~ 0.45 % of gdp ) . 
  and i 'm sure wilders whines about it but i prefer not to pay attention to that jackass . 
  bugger , thought i mentioned it being 2014 data . 
  yeah it was quite a bit more in the preceding years ( though not silly high in relative to gdp terms ) . 
  i 'm quite surprised how much the netherlands contributed that year . 
  that 's going to end up pissing off all facebook users in the eu . 
  [ decided too look it up . 
  ] ( http://english.eu.dk/en/faq/faq/net_contribution ) so third in absolute terms and tenth ( and last of the contributors ) in relative to gdp terms . 
  that does seem like a significant financial loss . 
  the 2014 data : | country | negative contribution in millions | as % gdp : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- 1 | germany | -15501.6 | -0.52 2 | france | -7164.6 | -0.33 3 | united kingdom | -4929.8 | -0.23 4 | the netherlands | -4711.1 | -0.71 5 | italy | -4467 | -0.28 6 | sweden | -2312.7 | -0.52 7 | belgium | -1478.1 | -0.37 8 | austria | -1240.6 | -0.38 9 | denmark | -836 | -0.32 10 | finland | -809 | -0.4 11 | ireland | 38.8 | 0.02 12 | luxembourg | 80.1 | 0.27 13 | cyprus | 114.8 | 0.69 14 | croatia | 173.6 | 0.42 15 | malta | 179.4 | 2.35 16 | estonia | 473.8 | 2.49 17 | slovenia | 794.4 | 2.17 18 | latvia | 799.8 | 3.46 19 | slovakia | 1010.1 | 1.37 20 | spain | 1090.6 | 0.1 21 | lithuania | 1543.2 | 4.38 22 | bulgaria | 1824.3 | 4.45 23 | czech republic | 3004.2 | 2.08 24 | portugal | 3211.3 | 1.88 25 | romania | 4519.9 | 3.09 26 | greece | 5162.6 | 2.89 27 | hungary | 5681.6 | 5.64 28 | polen | 13748 | 3.47 | country | negative contribution in millions | as % gdp : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- 1 | the netherlands | -4711.1 | -0.71 2 | germany | -15501.6 | -0.52 3 | sweden | -2312.7 | -0.52 4 | finland | -809 | -0.4 5 | austria | -1240.6 | -0.38 6 | belgium | -1478.1 | -0.37 7 | france | -7164.6 | -0.33 8 | denmark | -836 | -0.32 9 | italy | -4467 | -0.28 10 | united kingdom | -4929.8 | -0.23 11 | ireland | 38.8 | 0.02 12 | spain | 1090.6 | 0.1 13 | luxembourg | 80.1 | 0.27 14 | croatia | 173.6 | 0.42 15 | cyprus | 114.8 | 0.69 16 | slovakia | 1010.1 | 1.37 17 | portugal | 3211.3 | 1.88 18 | czech republic | 3004.2 | 2.08 19 | slovenia | 794.4 | 2.17 20 | malta | 179.4 | 2.35 21 | estonia | 473.8 | 2.49 22 | greece | 5162.6 | 2.89 23 | romania | 4519.9 | 3.09 24 | latvia | 799.8 | 3.46 25 | polen | 13748 | 3.47 26 | lithuania | 1543.2 | 4.38 27 | bulgaria | 1824.3 | 4.45 28 | hungary | 5681.6 | 5.64, 
  even with the rebate ? 
  i think they 're just agreeing with you . 
   expansion into space or independence from earth if you will . 
  there are extinction events other that drastic climate change . 
  if earth gets hit by an extremely virulent disease , an asteroid , a supervolcano , some grey-goo-esque nano-bot nightmare , global thermonuclear war or god knows what , it would be rather nice if there were some self-sufficient populations off-planet . 
  worst case scenario they survive and humanity has n't gone extinct , best case scenario they 're in a position to provide aid to survivors on earth . 
   but i 'm afraid such actions wo n't happen until 2024 at a very least what 'll happen in 2024 ? 
   you confused a nuclear reactor with an enrichment centrifuge . 
  while he did confuse the two i 'm not seeing how it detracts from the security issue . 
  unless nuclear reactors have some property that prevents any computers controlling them from being compromised . 
  you sure he 's an anarchist and not just an an-cap ? 
  ( i also sincerely doubt the guy 's a socialist/leninist . ), 
  i do n't have time to really search/read the studies at the momtent , but [ a cursory google scholar search has relevant results ] ( https://scholar.google.nl/scholar?q=related:yd6rtaaf76gj:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5 ) . 
  that montage is kinda bullshit though . 
  they took a single political speech of klaver and compared it to multiple speeches of obama , so obviously you 're going to be able to find a lot of overlap . 
  ( not to mention that political speeches tend to share a lot of language and sentiment . ), 
  leftist here , fission i 'm unsure of , fusion could be fucking awesome if we could be bothered to invest properly into research . 
  fun fact , [ greenleft ] ( https://groenlinks.nl/standpunten/alternatieve-zorg ) wants to subject alternative medicine to regulation which royally pisses off the alternative medicine sector . 
  seriously though i wonder which party is politically speaking closest to anarchism . 
  probably sp , maybe greenleft . 
  `` partij voor '' is dutch for `` party for '' so you 're bound to find multiple parties that way :p . 
   sad for both polish and hungarian citizens . 
  sad for some just deserves for others ( surely some voted for this nonsense ) . 
  including the one it 's being levied against ? 
  well , guess that 'll be my silver lining if worse comes to worse . 
  did his popularity dip after the gedoogconstructie ? 
  i know it 's not exactly the same as ruling but i do n't recall it impacting him significantly . 
   it is unlikely he will get the same chance again meh . 
  i can see the vvd and cda allying themselves with him again . 
  searching youtube for [ limburgs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=limburgs ) should yield some results . 
  for example [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od2upwg7_ji ) radio thing , where they do a news article in limburgs starting at 1:30 . 
  ( for those wondering , the radio thing is a [ yearly charity drive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serious_request ) hence the transparent box/chamber and all the people watching . 
  the box changes location and was in limburg at the time of recording hence the reading of a news article in limburgs . ), 
  seriously , do have a link ? 
  yeah the first sentence is so badly translated it ends up having the opposite meaning . 
   the only pseudoscience i see from right wingers is climate change denial . 
  what about gay conversion therapy ? 
  is n't pence a big fan of that ? 
  we do n't , though a lot of companies tend to only give temporary contracts . 
  as far as i know similar a thing is going on the in the netherlands ( apart from the lower wage but lower cost of living part of course ) . 
   reddit recognizes the \\ \\ symbol as some sort of cancellation modifier . 
  it 's called an [ escape character ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escape_character ) , which means that the character \\ \\ tells reddit to treat the character immediately following \\ \\ as a normal character without any special properties . 
  for example ` \\* x \\* ` results \\* x \\* instead of * x * . 
  this is also why you need 2 backslashes in order to show one , the first will tell reddit to treat the second as an normal character instead of an escape character . 
  just fyi , this can be used to fix broken links that end with a closing bracket , by escaping the second to last bracket : [ broken ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slash_ ( punctuation ) ) [ broken ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slash_ ( punctuation ) ) [ broken ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slash_ ( punctuation \\ ) ) [ works ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slash_ ( punctuation \\ ) ), 
  the [ bq aquaris x5 plus ] ( https://www.bq.com/en/aquaris-x5plus ) also supports it . 
  i 'm pretty sure my phone installed an update enabling galileo last week . 
  though i 'm not sure how i 'd go about figuring out what satellites it 's using for its gps . 
  well ...  the [ ecj ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/court_of_justice_of_the_european_union ) refers to the case-law of the european court of human rights and treats the convention on human rights as though it was part of the eu 's legal system , since it forms part of the legal principles of the eu member states . 
  [ ( source ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_court_of_human_rights#relationship_with_other_courts ) so in order to get out of the european convention on human rights ( of which [ privacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_convention_on_human_rights#article_8_-_privacy ) is a part ) you need to get out of both the cjeu and echr . 
  human rights maybe ? 
  political commitment is quite a different thing from legally binding . 
  we all know how good most politicians are at weaseling out of a commitment . 
  ( not to mention that the political mandate the referendum represents is unclear as fuck . 
  barely anyone bothered to vote and of those that did quite a lot seemed mistaken as to what the referendum was actually about . ), 
  really ? 
  i thought the results were non-binding . 
  sure but being politically compelled is a hell of a lot less clear cut than being legally compelled . 
  are n't there still anti-brexit forces in the uk political landscape ? 
  i suspect that , similar to the netherlands , they introduced the concept of a referendum without actually changing their constitution ( or whatever document the uk has ) . 
  the result of which is a half-measure referendum that 's unable to legally compel the government to act ( cause the constitution guarantees the sovereignty of parliament , i think , and it was n't changed ) . 
  yep . 
  klaver seems to be doing pretty well in his media appearances . 
  though so far we have n't done much more than recover from the zenith that was the previous elections . 
  and if there 's one thing i 'm taking away from 2016 is that one should n't underestimate the right-wing populism , a pvv/vvd coalition would n't surprise me at this point . 
   capitalism needs accelerated growth to work and it does n't care if it has to destroy the environment or devour its own society to go on a bit longer . 
  the party i usually vote for has been arguing in favour of a sustainable economy . 
  both in the environmental sense and in the sense that the economy should n't require growth for it to function properly . 
  of course they 're getting nowhere fast in the polls . 
  denk appears , to me at least , to be some kind of quasi-populist counter/mirror to wilders .
