  they appear to be catering to the people that wilders is being xenophobic towards ( and those that sympathize with them of course ) who probably have a similar socio-economic background as wilders supporters . 
  it 's identity politics but that seems inevitable for a small party with a scope limited to the needs of minority groups . 
  but they 're basically negligible . 
  according to the polls they 'd get 2 seats in parliament at most . 
  for reference the sgp stands at 4 seats , and they 're a bunch of insane right-wing conservative christians who want to turn the netherlands into a theocracy . 
  it still remains to be seen if denk will survive the coming elections and actually manage to get seats in parliament on their own . 
  ( the party currently consist of two defectors of labour . ), 
  yeah , maybe i 've been too little attention but as far as i can tell the real world left here in the netherlands does n't really concern itself with identity politics . 
  they mostly seem to concern themselves with the wellfare state and environment , granted most of the popular identity stuff seems fairly settled here ( apart from black pete of course ) . 
  but that is not something we can know beforehand . 
  so i figured it may be interesting to see the other side 's perspective on the conflict in hamburg . 
  crimethinc is an international anarchist collective that publishes media ( news , books , videos , podcasts , etc ) . 
  obviously the take the side of the protesters in the conflict in hamburg and present a narrative of police violence vs the will of the people . 
  in that sense their take on events is quite different from the more mainstream media . 
  ( they also have a nice [ starting point ] ( https://crimethinc.com/start ) for anyone who wants to understand anarchism a bit better . ), 
  both ? 
  surely politics is a bit more complex than that ? 
   the lack of nuance in both extremes of the political spectrum is highly counter-productive . 
  which extremes are you talking about ? 
  cause this is sounds a lot like `` horshoe theory '' , which is utter bullshit . 
  or you do n't betray your principles and lose a lot of votes to pvdd . 
  remember what happened with the kunduz `` police '' mission ? 
   from my perspective ** as an academic ** , though , the uk is going to sustain quite a bit of damage ** in this domain specifically ** . 
  he 's an academic talking about brexit 's impact on academia . 
  ( which is massive because of eu subsidies and international cooperation . ), 
  so yeah he has authority on the matter . 
   the netherlands has a 17 million population and a gdp bigger than poland without need for tax tricks no tax tricks ? 
  the netherlands is basically a tax haven already !, 
  i 'm not saying we needed it to grow our economy ( cause frankly the brievenbusfirmas that result from these tax policies are kinda pointless ) but you ca n't deny that we hava n't done our fair share of tax trickery . 
  heck the tweede kamer is supposed to debate on this very topic this evening . 
  pfeh , english barely counts as a foreign language . 
  most kids start learning it in elementary school and afaik it 's a requirement for each level of secondary education . 
  nah , you 're just an idiot . 
  if you neglect to consider the problem seriously sure . 
  but if you did , i 'd love to see your proof that one supersedes the other in all conceivable circumstances . 
  but it 's pro-privacy . 
  and whether one of these two fundamental rights supersedes the other is kinda hard to say . 
  case by case based on public interest seems a more sensible way to go . 
  immediate cessation of freedom of communication , association and speech so our governments can prevent anyone from voting in this referendum ? 
  they probably failed to realise the implications actually preventing people from voting on this would have . 
  wait , why the heck does this have the little controversial cross sign ? 
  the problem with crazy maniacs is that if there is a sufficient number of them their behaviour becomes an expectation rather than the exception , hence the talk about cultural change . 
  i 'm sorry but i ca n't take anybody who thinks the utterly oxymoronic anarcho-capitalism is realistic in any way shape or form seriously . 
  though if you want to know how `` policing '' would work , just look up how marginalised communities ( the kind that ca n't go to the police cause the police will just screw them over ) handle their need for security . 
  the best i can scrounge up on short notice and while on mobile is [ this ] ( https://crimethinc.com/podcast/6 ) podcast . 
  hate to break it to you but everything is political already , whether you like it or not . 
  including wherever implicit assumptions you made about efficiency ( cause depending on how you define it anything can be considered efficient or inefficient ) . 
  and your decision not to think about some stuff . 
  then i think you misunderstand anarchism , do n't worry lots of people do . 
  the core concept of anarchism is that all unjustified social hierarchies should be dismantled , which includes capitalism and the state . 
  anarchism is quite fond of order , as long as it is n't imposed from on high . 
  and it 's quite collectivist because it requires the means of production to be collectivized and everyones needs to be met . 
  ( btw , there 's these people calling themselves anarcho-capitalists . 
  they 're not anarchists , they 're just economically far-right anti-statist co-opting leftist terminology . ), 
  i 'd go deeper into it but it 's getting late here . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfywamkzcbm ) seems to do a good job of explaining it though . 
   anarchism does n't sound like a better alternative to me . 
  any reason in particular ? 
  i do n't have any politically feasible ideas , then again ubi is n't exactly politically feasible either . 
  if i were to ignore current politically feasibility i 'd go for anarchism . 
  at the moment capitalism is a bit too entrenched ( both in practical and ideological terms ) to get rid of it . 
  i 'm kinda conflicted about it . 
  one the one hand , assuming it 'll be high enough , it 'll deal with a lot of poverty/precariat problems . 
  on the other hand it does n't deal in the slightest with the systemic issues that underly most of our problems . 
  an official spokesman of the government making an announcement should be good enough . 
  afaik rutte has n't said anything about this . 
  i was honestly just annoyed at some right-winger trying to create the appearance as if opposition to this referendum is somehow rare . 
  if you really insist on making a difference between official announcements by the kabinet and politicians saying things themselves then have fun reading this ( dutch ) article quoting three politicians speaking out against the referendum . 
  if this is the first time you see this kinda thing you have n't been paying attention . 
  iirc it originally went `` you ca n't eat your cake and have it '' , which makes sense , but it got turned around somehow . 
  or sudo rm - rf -- no-preserve-root /, 
  well according to [ cbs.nl ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/themas/bevolking/cijfers/extra/piramide-fx.htm ) the bulge of soon-to-be pensioners that are often accused of making healthcare and pensions so expensive are the ~ 40 to ~ 65 year olds . 
  and if their predictions hold ( so barring any sudden change in birth/death rates ) the distribution will start to look level around 2035 . 
  so we got to find a temporary solution for the next ~ 20 years , after which the ratio of pensioners to workers will start decrease . 
  wait for the elderly to die and try to maintain a flat population distribution ? 
  the eu is n't really at fault because ( at least in the case of agricultural subsidies ) the eu is n't allowed to bypass the states and give subsidies directly to those who need it . 
  instead they give the subsidies to member states who then distribute it as they see fit . 
  this was probably set up this way cause the member states feared a loss of sovereignty if the eu could grant subsidies directly to the intended recipients ( potentially influencing local markets/development ) . 
  was n't france trying to veto the reformation to cap ? 
  ( or are they trying to veto additional changes to cap , beyond the reformations of 2013 ? ), 
  according to the text on the linked page the legal reformations were proposed on 12 october of this year . 
  the actual reforms are to take effect in 2013 ( probably cause the new eu budget will be in effect from ~ ~ 2013 ~ ~ 2014 to 2020 ) , they 've been worked on since 2010 . 
  i 'm not sure , but i think that the frequent suggestions that they may actually leave the eu ( or are at least considering it ) also adds a lot the the negative attitude . 
  mmmm , i do n't like the amount of personal information they require . 
  could you source that ? 
  ( words `` budget '' and `` cut '' are n't mentioned in the article . ), 
  i 'm not quite sure but true socialism ( at least in the sense that you are talking about ) does n't really exist western europe . 
  what we would refer to as socialism is more akin to [ social democracy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democracy ) . 
  what we want is to address social injustice through ( semi - ) public services ( healthcare , education , unions , pensions , etc ) which we would fund through a progressive tax system . 
  ( there are some other things traditionally associated with the left but fighting social injustice is really the core of modern socialism . ), 
  no modern non-fringe party in western europe want to truly end the free market . 
  yeah the dynamics are a lot simpler in the case of private industry ( although the health of the company should be of interest to the employees ) , especially if the employees have an easier time finding new work than the employers have finding new employees ( otherwise striking could still backfire if it results in lay-offs ) . 
  on the other hand public workers are indirectly employed by the whole nation ( through the government ) . 
  iirc here in the netherlands i 've seen partial-strikes , where public workers keep performing essential tasks but refuse to do ( part of ) the non-essential bits . 
  so they do cause economic damage and inconvenience the common man ( though not to the extend a full strike would cause ) but suffer a far smaller pr backlash that a full strike would cause , while still pressuring their employers ( politicians or state-owned companies ) . 
  and i do n't think these public sector workers take striking lightly , most of them realize how important their role is in society , but they have to look out for themselves as well . 
  you do realize that the damage caused is kinda the point of the strike ? 
  strikes and protest are partly for raising awareness and partly for causing economic damage . 
  after all you ca n't get your way by threaten with a strike/protest if you do n't go through with it or if the effects of a strike/protest are negligible . 
  ( note i do n't know anything about this specific strike , this was just intended as a remark on strikes in general . ),
