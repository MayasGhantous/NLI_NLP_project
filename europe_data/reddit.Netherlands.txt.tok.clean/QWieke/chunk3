  yeah we still need to figure out a proper way to bridge the gap . 
  though i suspect the gaps can be mitigated by approaching the energy problem at a larger scale . 
  sure total energy production in the netherlands could vary wildly depending on local conditions , but energy production in , say , all of europe ? 
  that would be a lot more stable . 
  granted i do n't know if our energy transport technology is efficient enough to be used in a europe-wide smart grid . 
  but it 's something we could at least be working on . 
  i 'd take far less issue with shale gas if it was a part of a clearly defined roadmap to total clean energy ( or at least clean enough that the environment can cope with it ) , but from where i am standing this does not appear to be the case at all . 
  our current government does not seem to care one bit about the environment ( or public health for that matter ) . 
   unless you are for nuclear and tidal barrages your not providing a solution i 'm not clear on the environmental impact of tidal barrages , but if it is n't too bad i 'm all for it . 
  ( yes that includes nuclear . ), 
   solar and wind are inadequate for base load got a source for that ? 
  ( i mean i 'm aware of the intermittency issue , but if we can bridge those gaps base load should n't be that hard to achieve . ), 
  but we have the tech to do nuclear ( unless you meant fusion not fission ) and hydro , no stop gap is necessary . 
  if we did that i 'd be far less against it , though i do n't think i 'm even being slightly cynical when i say that this is never going to happen . 
   are you advocating that there should be no carbon emissions ever anywhere in the world ? 
  as a long-term goal yes , or at least to a mere fraction of our current emissions . 
  no amount of shale gas tax earnings are going to compensate for the damage climate change does . 
  and if jobs are your main concerns , well , the clean energy sector needs people too . 
  plus the environment is more important that the economy . 
   shale gas is a * relatively clean * form of energy . 
  we should n't be going for relatively clean , we should be going for clean . 
  yeah fuck it , who cares about co2 emissions anyway ? 
  half the reason i visit these threads is to find out if i 've missed anything , cause from my point of view it appears like there is rarely any newsworthy happening here in the netherlands . . 
  i wonder if this would override dutch law , because we got [ legislation that enforces net neutrality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/net_neutrality#law_in_the_netherlands ) . 
  i interpreted as : it 's better to live in a country with high taxes and a good welfare/social-security system than in a country with low taxes and a bad welfare/social-security system . 
  though your interpretation seems better . 
  so nearly every dutch person ? 
   we do n't even have any tanks . 
  same here , we just sold ours to the fins . 
  sounds exactly like the vvd ( pm rutte 's party ) and pvv ( wilder 's party ) over here . 
   across the eu proportionally to the population would n't defence spending proportional to gpd or such make more sense ? 
  just because a country has a large population does n't mean it can afford a large military . 
  did n't the renovations of rijksmuseum just finish , that got ta be worth a visit ? 
  ( and most of the paintings were restored to their original state , cleaned up etc. ), 
  plus we 're really close by and nearly everyone speaks english . 
  but according to [ the map ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:freedom_of_panorama_in_europe_nc.svg ) on the actual [ freedom of panorama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_panorama ) page on wikipedia ( that map was made more recent than yours ) it 's legal to photograph art in a public place in romenia as long as it 's for a non-commercial purpose . 
  plus while there are some where there is n't freedom of panorama , most of the eu countries have it . 
  were these actually banned ? 
  or did the national governments block this ? 
  ( i remember it passing through the eu parliament . ), 
  better late than never . 
  turns out you were [ right ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1t7ix4/who_brings_gifts_to_europe_translations_of_santa/ce54e88 ) . 
  sure , but the map 's title strongly suggest that it 's about the gift bringers . 
  ( unless the caption was n't a part of the original map of course . ), 
  plus there appear to be plenty of non-santaclauses on the map . 
  from the pdf :  following the widely accepted definition of fundamentalism of bob altermeyer and bruce hunsberger , the fundamentalism belief system is defined by three key elements :  - that believers should return to the eternal and unchangeable rules laid down in the past ;  - that these rules allow only one interpretation and are binding for all believers ;  - that religious rules have priority over secular laws . 
  yeah i 'm pretty sure this one is wrong about the netherlands . 
  it 's sinterklaas that brings the gifts , i 'm not sure if the kerstman is even much of a thing around here . 
  edit : it appears the creator of the map only focused on late-december and early-januari gift givers and chose to ignore the various saint nickolas traditions . 
  bit lame if you ask me but that 's what it is . 
  [ link to creator 's comment on / r/mapporn ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1t7ix4/who_brings_gifts_to_europe_translations_of_santa/ce54e88 ), 
  does n't it go both ways ? 
  could n't the us gps be blocked without interfering with gallileo as well ? 
  and it 's worth is probably going to go up once nuclear fusion becomes commercially viable . 
  we ( the netherlands ) are 31th , thirty-fucking-first , goddamnit . 
  worse thing is i 'm not even surprised . 
  meh , i only pay ~ $ 2.5 for my data . 
  got the contact with hi right near the end of the let 's - offer-really-cheap-data-and-recoup-the-cost-with-sms-and-phone-use-hey-why-are-you-all-now-using-apps-for-that-instead-of-normal-phone-functions craze . 
  wow , i struggle to use 250 mb of data each month . 
  ( some email , some calendar app , little spotify , though most of my playlists are saved . ), 
  and most of the other parties who think the eu is a good thing but still requires varying degrees of improvement . 
  but yeah , if you want to go anti-european you 're stuck with the crazies here . 
  well , pvv and sp are euroskeptic not europhiles . 
  and most of the pro-europe parties all have their critiques of the current eu , hardly blind support . 
   every party is filled with europhiles that are blind to criticism . 
  you may want to redo your research . 
  yeah , let 's not start a race to the bottom . 
  basic human right ? 
  an incentive not to resort to crime if you 're in such dire need ? 
  you really think society would be better if we let the unfortunate starve ? 
  ( including their children ? ), 
  getting the bare minimum so you can afford food and shelter would hardly constitute a reward . 
   austerity ( keeping costs down ) while killing consumer confidence and punishing those dependent on welfare . 
  c'mon programming ability is barely language dependent . 
  as long as you are familiar with the programming paradigm you should be able to pick language up pretty quickly . 
  maybe some of the languages i know today will become obsolete during my lifetime , but i 'd still be able to learn the new ones quickly . 
  plus programming as a logical/formal problem solving exercise could also be worth it , not to mention the interesting algorithms that could be covered . 
  having said that , computer programing would probably be a useless skill for most of the secondary school students . 
  a generic computer use & maintenance class would seem far more useful so people are n't helpless in the face of a malfunctioning pc . 
   it measures how good you are at iq tests . 
  and how good you are at iq tests is completely independent of all the other qualities a person might posses ? 
  c'mon it 's indicative of at least some aspects of intelligence , unless you 've been practicing iq tests or something . 
  also just because we have good education compared to the rest of the world does n't mean we should strive to improve it further . 
  it 's the global corruption * perception * index ( op failed to mention this in his title ) , a lot of corruption has come to light recently which has had an affect on the perception of corruption . 
  whether actual corruption is up or down is n't mentioned . 
  it got worse , not better , the index is ordered from least corrupt to most corrupt . 
  i just thought it was a weird-ass joke on british queuing . 
   s&p has downgraded the netherlands to aa + with a positive outlook ( from aaa with a negative outlook ) . 
  that just seems odd to me . 
  you 'd think ( or at least i do ) that a positive/negative outlook signifies a positive/negative trend , which would be independent of the actual rating . 
  ( to me it sounds like they 've downgraded us from `` good but getting worse '' to `` okay but getting better '' which does n't make any sense . 
  so i 'm probably misinterpreting it . ), 
  ca n't say i 've been looking to learn more about it . 
  though i know there was a study/experiment done on [ basic income in canada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mincome ) . 
  and of course there is plenty of [ stuff on youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=basic%20income&amp;oq=&amp;gs_l= ) . 
  hence [ this eu basic income initiative ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/req-eci-2012-000028/public/index.do ) . 
  mmmm , tough question the number of dutch songs i know is rather limited . 
  i 'd go for either [ nehalenia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbpdom4qwhe ) by heidevolk or [ watskebeurt ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfjkrvqe5dy ) by de jeugd van tegenwoordig , although i 'm not entirely certain the latter is actually dutch . 
  jup , ~ 1/5 dutch voters support pvv ( geert wilders ' party ) , ~ 1/6 voters support the vvd ( mark rutte 's party ) . 
  it 's pretty fucking depressing .
