  jup , though i expected them to be a little bit more sneaky about it . 
  ah , that sounds like the definition used at [ eurostat ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=teilm020&amp;tableselection=1&amp;plugin=1 ) . 
   data point for germany : 5,1 % unemployment what measure of unemployment is this ? 
  i know that , i just do n't see how / u/netzaj 's image relates to that . 
   the support for the pvv is getting crazy scary . 
  yeah it boggles the mind , the next parliamentary election is going to be fascinating ( in a morbid kind of way ) . 
  i do n't get it , what 's that supposed to be ? 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure that was n't such a good move , our government does not seem to give two shits about privacy either . 
   `` i believe greece should be for greeks '' `` we should always preserve our culture over the cultural demands of minorities/non greeks '' mmm , i would 've referred to that as xenophobic . 
  edit : oh and i 'd like to nominate the netherlands , cause the polls seem to indicate that 1/5 of us would vote pvv ( geert wilder 's party ) . 
  found [ a bit ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekpiddq8m2s&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h57m35s ) where judith sargentini asks a question about the aivd purchasing illegial intelligence software . 
  ( shame it is dubbed over though . ), 
  oh i agree , we need pan-european ballots asap . 
  i have n't read it closely , but according to the wikipedia article on the uk 's [ misuse of drugs act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misuse_of_drugs_act_1971 ) it appears to be illegal . 
  the scottish guys is talking about our governments , / u/xenthe is talking about us citizens . 
  yes a lot of our governments would probably react similarly to a leak as the us government has . 
  but that does n't mean i ( or we ) would react with the same hostility . 
  plus there 's the whole `` leaking to an unfriendly country '' thing , which is just conspiratorial nonsense . 
  they have , but if the gets asylum he would n't have to travel as a us citizen anymore but as a citizen of whatever country granted him asylum . 
   you are welcome to express those preferences of yours in your own democracy , and we can express those of ours . 
  oh i do , during the whole snowden 's asylum thing the party i vote for , and am a member of , greenleft was one of two parties that held the position that we should offer snowden asylum ( the other party was the socialist party ) . 
  and they 're working on big changes for the dutch equivalent of the freedom of information act , further limiting exceptions to the law , creating an information supervisor that oversees the application of the law , automatically releasing information via a special website and some other stuff . 
  you 're replying to a dutch person so it would be an aivd or bvd employee that would do the leaking . 
  personally i would welcome a leak ( we might finally get some definitive insight in the role our security agencies have played in the whole nsa spying stuff ) . 
  our government is far too secretive to begin with and i 'd welcome any kind of transparency ( be it voluntary our involuntary ) . 
  i thought it was changed somewhat ? 
  ( not too much though , the vvd would n't allow it . ), 
   and is it true that the netherlands had a property bubble ?? 
  jup , we had a crazy mortgage tax deduction scheme and it artificially inflated the housing prices . 
  seems a bit optimistic to me . 
   30bn : factual costs of the basic income which could be financed by increasing vat from 8 % to 20 % . 
  wtf , 20 % vat pays for basic income ?!, 
  we have 20 % vat here ( 21 % maybe , i do n't know if those plans went through ) , what are we paying for that the swiss do n't ? 
  the colorscale irks me , the change from red to blue seems far to sudden . 
  fuck i 'd be happy if it just causes the aivd to behave . 
  mmmm , i think my english vocabulary may be contaminating my dutch vocabulary . 
   `` dude , relax . '', 
  ( in dutch ) is n't `` dude , relax . '', 
  in dutch just `` dude , relax . 
  i 'm fairly certain / u/lenar _ hoyt was joking  . . 
  anyway let 's hope gd v2 .0 learns from this and will maintain a cleaner , less criminal/murdery , organisation . 
  [ google translate link ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fnetzwelt%2fnetzpolitik%2fnsa-eu-kommissarin-neelie-kroes-lobt-edward-snowdens-enthuellungen-a-928834.html ) ( german to english ), 
  i suspect that the only reason the ep policy tends to be right on these kinds of things is because they do n't have any power . 
   if they would scan all whatsapp messages , would they admit it ? 
  i doubt they would . 
  [ the police supposedly acted on a verbal tip . 
  ] ( http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/10/10/politiebezoek-na-mondelinge-tip-niet-door-whatsapp-bericht-over-bom/ ) though i ca n't help but wonder who tipped them off , one would expect that only the two people involved in the communication would know about it . 
  afaik , they 're keeping their heads down until the next elections , so they have n't really been trying to recover ( though internally the leadership/rules that lead to the scandal have been fixed ) . 
  and his party ( just him , he 's the only member ) is currently leading [ the polls ] ( http://www.allepeilingen.com/ ) . 
  [ sigh ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiwhmb3jxme ), 
  tl : drish :  even if [ rate of shale gas extraction ] did reach an average of 10 per cent -- a rather optimistic level -- the potential production of shale gas would not exceed a total of 1,300 billion cubic metres in europe . 
  that is , over a production period of 25 years , barely five per cent of what europe consumes each year . 
   the calculations come up with , at best , a few tens of thousands of jobs per country . 
  this is certainly not negligible in today 's circumstances . 
  but shale gas will not be the formula that will let europe climb out of its crisis . 
  indeed , the pvv is polling at about 30 seats out of 150 ( which is 20 % ) . 
  pretty sure those were elementary school teachers , maybe the secondary education teachers are good at damage control ? 
  yeah but how does that preclude them from being `` true refugees '' ? 
   `` true refugees '' do n't have $ 3000 per person to pay the smugglers that 's a bit limited , so well off person wo n't ever need to flee a war , or leave their country for political reasons ? 
  they 're pro-europe but think a lot of improvement is required before further integration can take place ( mostly making the thing more democratic and transparent ) . 
  they 're probably one of the more pro european parties in the netherlands . 
  greenleft probably , they 're a part of the the greens | efa group . 
  yeah , it 's pretty much all of the north-western eu countries that benefit from it . 
  no reason to single out germany . 
  especially if you consider how important the coal & steel industry was for the military at the time . 
  fyi , you accidentally quadruple posted , might wan na delete the spares . 
   to be fair , the eu integration has been due to economic necessity and not because of political agenda . 
  eh , not really though . 
  a good number of the aims mentioned in [ the founding declaration of the european coals and steel community ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_coal_and_steel_community#schuman_declaration ) have little to do with economics and a lot to do with politics . 
  still not exactly my thing , but it is a definite improvement . 
  and they 're probably better off not asking any senior citizens for directions . 
  mmm , most roundabouts ( of which we have lots ) do have some kind of sculpture in the middle bit , maybe he was referring to that ? 
  fair enough , getting worked up can happen to the best of us . 
  i think the reason that op is getting all those upvotes is because from a secular perspective raising a kid religiously ( especially if it involves religiously motivated bigotry and denies the kid a basic understanding of science and scientific facts ) just seems kinda abusive . 
  of course limiting freedom of religion to adults only is taking it waaaay to far , it would basically be thought-crime legislation and no one wants that . 
  plus the worst of it could probably be prevented by perfectly reasonable anti-child abuse ( physical and psychological ) legislation and compulsory education ( combined with a proper secular curriculum ) . 
  ow and in my post i was just trying to show how you could probably use existing legislation ( like underage drinking laws and laws against child abuse ) as a template for anti-religious upbringing laws . 
  calm down . 
  did you even read this line in my post ? 
   while i 'm not sure if it would be a good idea to enforce such a policy , i 'll take a stab at making one up . 
  i 'm not sure i get what you 're trying to say here , are you a [ normative moral relativist ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral_relativism#normative ) ? 
  an example of these horrible implications would probably help . 
   so , honestly , what do you imagine enforcement for this policy will look like ? 
  while i 'm not sure if it would be a good idea to enforce such a policy , i 'll take a stab at making one up . 
  * put an age restriction on attendance to religious services and enforce them the same way other restrictions on the purchase of goods/services is restricted . 
  * consider a strict religious upbringing to be child abuse and enforce it the same way other laws against child abuse are enforced . 
  * set a proper secular curriculum for public and private schools . 
  private schools should probably be allowed to add to the curriculum but not remove or replace things . 
  enforce it the same way current curriculum and educational standards are enforced . 
  * disallow home schooling for religious reasons . 
  note that the last two policies are already law here in the netherlands . 
   do n't take for granted that your values are objectively correct . 
  sure but that does n't mean i ca n't think they better relative to other values . 
   i hope everyone here passing judgement realises that the citizens may feel differently and act differently from the government . 
  then they should vote differently ? 
  i mean i get that in a dysfunctional democracy the government may not necessarily represent it 's people properly . 
  i get that in some democracies the electorate is n't exactly spoiled for choice . 
  and i get that whatever coalition forms based on the election results may differ significantly from the preference of the electorate or divert significantly from it over time ( like rutte 2 ) . 
  but at the end of the day it 's the * electorate * that * elects * the government . 
  if political trends stay the same over the course of multiple elections i ca n't help but conclude that , * as a whole * , the electorate agrees with it or is at least unwilling to do something about it ( or is perhaps just too dumb to notice ) .
