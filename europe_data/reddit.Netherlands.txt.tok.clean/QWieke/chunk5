  i ca n't help but assume that a significant portion of the dutch population consists of retarded xenophobes if [ geert wilder 's gets about 31 of the 150 seats in the polls ( more than any of the other parties ) ] ( http://www.allepeilingen.com/ ) . 
  and the 22 seats to vvd , 20 to sp or the 12 to 50 + do n't put me in a good mood either . 
  mmm , i always assumed homoeopathy came to be after someone over-generalized the concept of inoculation . 
   mostly it would be nice if we had our first left-wing government ever . 
  i could n't agree with you more . 
  but i 'm afraid that my initial idea for this thread ( space fountain ) was [ more realistic ] ( http://www.allepeilingen.com/ ) . 
  for crying out loud , ~ 30 seats for a party with only one member . 
  http://xkcd.com/1138/ because the image lacks the alt-text . 
  personally i 'd prefer an electoral system that is complicated but good over one that 's simple but bad . 
  there have already been a bunch of major austerity measures ( ~ 2.5 billion last year ) , supported by both the vvd and labour , the current cabinet has been around for little of a year ( frankly i 'm surprised they lasted this long ) . 
  it has cost labour a lot in the polls , they lost about 20 of the 38 seats , vvd lost about 10 of the 41 . 
  and let 's not forget that the previous government was also led by the vvd ( and others ) and they were n't shy with the austerity measure then either . 
  still quite a bit shy from 100 million . 
  nope , that 's just his ( tax free ) salary . 
  damn , you 'd expect them to get it right . 
  and it 's off by quite a lot , the entire royalty thing is only costing us about ~ ~ 8 ~ ~ 36 million a year , which includes personnel , castle maintenance , etc. 
  to be fair you 're off by a factor of ~ 100 , he 's paid $ 825 thousand not $ 100 million . 
  granted it should probably be a bit less . 
  you 're pretty much right , though it is the cabinet of ministers who write the speech , not strictly speaking the governing party . 
  ministers are kinda expected to rise above party politics and concern themselves with more than just their own constituency , not that they always do this . 
  the surprising thing about the speech was that it seemed quite right-wing while half of the current ruling coalition consists of labour , i thought they liked the welfare state . 
  sure , the underlying problems need to be addressed in a proper fashion , i do n't think anyone here would deny that . 
  but if ^ * the golden dawn are acting like a criminal organisation they ought to be treated as such , just because they 're also a political group does n't mean they 're exempt from the law . 
  * : note that this is a conditional statement . 
  i 'm not claiming they are , or deserve to be considered as , a criminal organisation , frankly i do n't know enough about them to make that judgement , so i wo n't . 
   edit : i would love to see a european power stand up to america on such ridiculous issues . 
  [ like acta ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20120703ipr48247/html/european-parliament-rejects-acta ) ? 
  [ notice me !, 
  ] ( http://satwcomic.com/notice-me ), 
   imho the dutch welfare state is something to be proud of despite its current problems , and trading it so easily for the `` determining their own lives '' mindset is alarming . 
  i could not agree with this more . 
  and the whole `` participation state '' thing is just thinly veiled deception/manipulation suggesting that a welfare state does n't require participation while it does . 
  europa wide i apparently agree most with emer costello ( 90 % ) an italian politician and a cypriot party called movement for social democracy . 
  when limiting to just dutch politicians there are a bunch of them i agree somewhat with 67 % , including the ones i voted for last election , and the parties d66 , greenleft & pvda , which again includes the one i voted for last election . 
  ep political group wise i seem to agree the most with the alliance of liberals and democrats , the greens and progressive alliance of socialist and democrats . 
  ***** it occurs to me that perhaps the way i vote ( a random internet using citizen ) and the way the meps vote may not necessarily be truly comparable , after all i 'm just making a fast decision after reading a tiny bit of background information while the meps presumably make far better informed decisions , perhaps my decisions would have been different had i been similarly well informed . 
  i 'd rather let political ideology/goals and general trustworthiness and intelligence guide my vote during the next election rather than vote for the mep who agreed with my ( probably poorly informed ) decisions the most . 
  ***** also wtf , 1/4 of users voted in favour of acta ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that the speech is written by the cabinet and does n't necessarily have to reflect the kings own political views . 
  i do find it surprising that labour is willing to go along with it , then again they already seem to have lost all their credibility so maybe they just do n't care anymore . 
  mmm , seems cool , but the login-with-twitter function does n't seem to work here . 
  and i do wonder how much influence these political participation websites really have . 
  c'mon we all want a government that actually interested in the good of it 's country 's own citizens , we simply do n't agree on what that exactly means or how it should be achieved . 
  sometimes i want this government to fall as soon as possible , but then i remember what the current polls look like . 
  i do n't get how the pvda ( labour party ) could agree with this . 
  i 'm hard pressed to find the left-wing side of things , maybe the reduced mortgage deduction or some of the means tested welfare things . 
  and how do they think they can justify purchasing 37 joint strike fighters during these times of austerity ? 
  according to the flair selection menu it is `` basque country '' . 
   it 's the largest and most expensive salvage in history . 
  yesterday ( monday 16th ) a man of boskalis , a salving/maritime-construction company , was on [ pauw en witteman ] ( http://pauwenwitteman.vara.nl/gemist ) ^ * ( late night political dutch talk show ) and claimed their company would have done it for 250 to 300 million euros instead of the estimated 1.1 billion it 's going to cost now . 
  he basically blamed corruption ( `` the italian factor '' as he called it ) suggesting the local politicians preferred the method currently used because it is rather labour intensive and might boost the local economy ( there are ballast tanks and underwater scaffolding that are being constructed locally ) . 
  anyway he also talked a bit about moving the ship . 
  they ( boskalis ) apparently have this massive submersible ship/dockyard thing they could use to literally carry the entire cruise ship to wherever it needs to go , in case it is n't structurally sound enough to be towed . 
  that 'd be a sight to see . 
  * : at the moment yesterday 's episode has n't been put online , but it should appear at that page sometime this day , it 's all in dutch of course . 
  edit : c'mon people , i 'm just relaying what i saw on that show yesterday . 
  i know it was a competitor talking , the guy seemed quite bitter about the whole thing . 
  as a non-belgian , this is pretty easy . 
  i 'm pretty sure we already did something like this in the netherlands ( and i 'd expect some other countries to have done so as well ) . 
  it seems to work pretty well , nobody really wanted to bother with the 1 or 2 cent coins to begin with . 
   the ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 project was initiated by ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 gold corporation , a company of which the largest shareholder is the canada-based gabriel resources . 
  the open-pit mining project will use cyanide to extract gold and it is expected to require the razing of three villages and destroy four mountain tops . 
  if approved , it would be europe 's largest open-pit gold mine and it will result in 314 tonnes of gold and 1500 tonnes of silver . 
    the romanian government approved a new draft law needed for the ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 project in late august 2013 and it forwarded it to the parliament which had to vote on it in september . 
    activists involved in the ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 campaign claim that the project would cause an environment disaster , that it would destroy the ancient roman archeological sites and that the project involved handling assets to the canadian company , while the romanian state would earn too little out of the project . 
  another concern was the fact that the legislation would give the ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 gold corporation the right to give compulsory purchase orders to the residents of ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 who refused to sell their houses and lands . 
  [ wikipedia - 2013 romanian protests against the ro\u0219ia montan\u0103 project ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_romanian_protests_against_the_ro%c8%99ia_montan%c4%83_project ), 
  damn , that 's kinda awesome , hope the scheme works out . 
  i do like how it 's going to be a exoskeleton for civilian use rather than military use . 
  though i guess it will be easily adapted for a different purpose . 
  ( well unless it does n't carry it 's own power supply and just has a power-cord , that would n't work well on the battlefield . ), 
  i thought hayfever is caused by pollen and such , not by pollution . 
  perhaps the local flora was sufficiently different in zwolle ? 
   that is until some damn russian beat us in speed skating !, 
  who cares ?!, 
  we 'll just beat them at being happy !, 
  haha , why am i not suprised to see / r/mapporn on there ? 
  i 'm gon na go out on a limb here and assume he was born in friesland . 
  huh , ca n't remember a time when that was n't the case , then gain i am pretty young . 
   a dutch version of crazy populist us republicans . 
  aka a vvder ? 
  [ link to the same video but on youtube ] ( http://youtu.be/y-a8dahdqoo ) , frankly the website linked performed badly here . 
  anyway do n't have any meaningful thoughts on the subject , it 's obviously a serious issue but it seems like an law-enforcement/policing thing that just needs doing . 
  well 2/3rds of our economy and population lives below sea level , that 'd be exciting if it were n't for our excellent flood defences . 
  it is n't really surveillance if everyone can access the cameras and not just the people in power . 
   first off , which countries are the cheapest to live in ? 
    which countries governments have the best benefits ? 
  i suspect that these two are inversely related . 
  nah , i already live in the east of the netherlands . 
  true , though our governement does tend to underestimate the cost of such projects . 
  [ we already have ] ( http://www.deltacommissie.com/en/advies ) , assuming sea level rise is limited to 130 cm . 
  it is estimated that we 're going to have to spend at least 1 billion euros a year for the next 100 years in order to keep our feet dry . 
  let 's not just blame the right-wing politicians but also blame the millions of morons who voted for them . 
  seriously we , as a people , got exactly what we 've been asking for . 
  i copied the data to google docs [ here ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0alxl9pmydq-gdfnuuunuqkhubzayszhmwvfvwfhjcwc&amp;usp=sharing ) . 
  added a couple of map charts using google docs but that functionality leaves a lot to be desired ( a legend or the ability to properly edit the range of colours used ) . 
  hope someone else knows a better way to create map charts . 
  and some of you make [ awesome video games ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cd_projekt_red ) . 
  ( seriously ca n't wait for cyberpunk 2077 . ), 
  got quite a surprising number of different coins , especially considering that i have n't left the country for about a year .
