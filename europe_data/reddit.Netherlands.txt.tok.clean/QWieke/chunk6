  i 'm guessing it is because i live in nijmegen and we just had that international four days marches thing . 
  * germany : 1 cent , 5 cent , 2x 20 cent * france : 10 cent , 2x 20 cent * netherlands : 5 cent * belgium : 5 cent * finland : 5 cent * portugal : 2 cent * italy : 10 cent * austria : 10 cent * ireland : 20 cent * spain : 1 euro btw , used [ this image ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/eurocoins_national_side.jpg ) from wikipedia to identify the coins . 
  it 's a bit different from the wiener thing , that guy was basically cheating on his wife and then proceeded to lie about it . 
  criticize ! = insult, 
  damnit reuters , way to editorialize your headlines . 
  40 billion kenyan shillings = 346.8 million euros, 
  oh , just a proposal , well lets hope it gets accepted . 
   eu legislation which bans the withholding of clinical trial data that has actually been made into legislation ? 
  sweet !, 
   `` what is going to be talked about is regulations , laws , rules , and standards that effect our daily economic lives , that help us to live and work together . 
  for example they 're looking at health rules , the environment , employment law , hormone use with cattle , chlorine use in poultry farming , and gmos . '', 
  leaving aside the question whether the european or us laws/regulations/rules on these matters are better , i do n't see how these subjects are appropriate for a free trade deal . 
  should n't changes to these things be the subject of individual discussions in the appropriate parliaments ( be it european or local ) rather than being discussed in free trade negotiations with a foreign power * behind closed doors * ? 
  call me paranoid but i ca n't dismiss the possibility of this being yet another avenue through which certain interests will try to undermine our rights , liberties and regulations . 
  serioulsy ? 
  if you 're wondering this one seems to put you on all kinds of mailing lists , but the first confirmation email has a link to an unsubscribe page . 
  ( most mailing list have instructions on how to unsubscribe at the bottom of the mail in tiny letters . ), 
  do n't know how they arrived at a threshold of 25 000 signatures , seems a bit arbitrary , but what the hell they nearly got it . 
  pretty sure it 's primarily to facilitate trade * within * the bloc , not to facilitate trade with third parties at any cost . 
  so it has absolutely nothing to do with reducing carbon emissions ? 
  i 've seen people in other threads claim that they ( efd and ecr ) voted against it because they do n't want the eu to do anything . 
  not that an investigation is a bad idea but that it should n't be done by the eu . 
   there are no other parties that want to work together with the pvv i thought the vvd did n't rule out a coalition with the pvv . 
  ( granted the odds of the vvd and pvv getting 75 seats combined are rather low . ), 
   pirate party next elections ? 
  meh , [ according to bof ] ( http://www.digitalevrijheidswijzer.nl/ ) they 're not even best at digital freedoms . 
  ( though that guide may be a bit outdated . ), 
  is the debate still online somewhere ? 
  sounds interesting . 
  you did n't actually post a link , just text . 
  if you do a text post you have to include the link in the body of the text itself , you ca n't combine text and link posts . 
  ( either post a text post with a link in the body or post a link post and add a comment . ), 
  sounds like he is going to explain how the eu works in a future video , excellent !, 
  also i ca n't help but think that the `` outermost regions of the european union '' sounds like something that ought to refer to off-world colonies . 
  [ we apparently do n't . 
  plans for a similar system here in the netherlands were met with heavy resistance , in the interest of privacy . 
  well there are a good number of privacy watchdog organizations i 'm sure they could figure something out . 
  pretty sure that most countries in the eu do n't extradite people who could face the death penalty , though it 's limited protection at best . 
   some teenagers stole some high school exams and some politicians are somehow trying to connect it to islam . 
  did n't that happen weeks ago , or is this a new incident ? 
  [ someone else ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1h6noa/a_video_critical_italian_mep_baldassarre_has_been/cariybr ) in this comment section posted [ this link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpbnf1q_6tg ) , it has english subtitles . 
  ( edit : ah the mep that guides the journalist around is from the party for freedom , geert wilder 's anti-islamic anti-eu party , explains his attitude . 
  though some of the things they expose is quite redicilous . ), 
  so they 're comparing apples to oranges ? 
  and if we 're employing different measures would we still look bad if we corrected for it ? 
  assuming it 's hands are n't broken off . 
   but what would be the alternative ? 
  [ moving sidewalks ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moving_sidewalk ) ( or more realistically free trams/metros/buses . ), 
    bigot : a person who is utterly intolerant of any differing creed , belief , or opinion . 
  guess we 're all bigots then . 
  note this project began in 2003 , it ai n't like we got these results in a couple of months . 
  that is kinda what we have in the netherlands and i 'm not sure it actually works that well . 
  for starters the rails network and the train companies continually shift blame to one another about who 's responsible for certain aspects of rail maintenance ( spotting of problems and such ) . 
  secondly parts of the rail network are leased exclusively to one company , so they still have a local monopoly ( if i want to go from nijmegen to venly , veolia transport is my only option ) . 
  even if parts of the rail network are leased simultaneously to multiple companies and say alternating company trains every half hour or so , i still doubt anyone would be prepared to reschedule their planned journey by half an hour just so they could get a train from a different company . 
  no way differences between companies are going to be that big . 
  what would they even compete about ? 
  price , overhead , train quality ? 
  edit : a lot of these kinds of privatization schemes ( except for maybe electricity , mail and telecommunications ) have ended up in some kind of unholy private/public hybrid , where the company is n't public enough to give a proper shit about political repercussions and not private enough to give shit about financial repercussions . 
  they basically get to play the private company game without the risks . 
  competition ? 
  in rail transport ? 
  how ? 
  unlikely i had replied to it from my message inbox . 
  if i read this article correctly you are n't allowed to smack your kid as punishment . 
  note that it has only been banned since ~ 2007 ( iirc ) so odds are it would n't have been in effect during your childhood . 
  edit : damnit only just noticed you 're french , somehow i assumed you were dutch . 
  it 's still legal to hit your kid in france ? 
  mmm , i wonder what countries have made hitting children illegal , i know we did . 
  edit : google does have it 's uses : [ map of domestic corporal punishment abolition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:map_of_domestic_corporal_punishment_abolition.svg ), 
  i 'm sure that there is a lot of good dutch music but for some reason i just never find out about it . 
  from europe to europa ? 
  i 'm not big on music from the netherlands , my musical center of gravity probably lies across the channel . 
  there is however one dutch band i quite like , [ the staat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yyc6hvmazi ) . 
  and i 've got to say i 'm not a fan of the pornesque kind of music video . 
  oh op is silly far wanting to violate diplomatic immunity , it 'd make international diplomacy practically impossible for the eu . 
   is there any evidence the us was spying on any european head of state ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ggzkz/gchq_intercepted_foreign_politicians/ ? 
   moral right to declare war on us really , the moral right as well ? 
  it 's morally justified to start a war that would kill millions over the arrest of a single individual ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n11/patrick-cockburn/is-it-the-end-of-sykes-picot ) is an in-depth and really depressing article about the situation in syria . 
  alternatively watch [ this ] ( http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-june-13-2013/exclusive---fareed-zakaria-extended-interview-pt--2 ) part of yesterdays daily show interview . 
  the entire thing is such a clusterfuck of different islamic sects and other population groups that i do n't think you need cynicism to explain the inaction of the west ( not to mention that the russians are opposed to intervention ) . 
  whichever way it goes it 's probably going to end badly and no one in the west wants to be the one to have delivered the arms used in an ethnic cleansing . 
  though this is pretty freaking awesome , calling it an artificial kidney sounds a bit misleading to me . 
  i 'd probably prefer to call this a dialysis machine and reserve the term artificial kidney for something that can actually be transplanted into a human being . 
  i mean when reading artificial kidney my mind immediately went to organ printing / cloning . 
  awesome !, 
  i could n't find the clip , glad you did . 
  were the borg not some kind of metaphor for communism ? 
  a long time ago , iirc , some stds were known as the portugese disease over here , in the age old tradition of naming stds after your enemies . 
  we used to be pretty big trade rivals , even had [ a 61 year war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch%e2%80%93portuguese_war ) . 
  edit : spelling, 
  i did n't mean by objectivity that it should be a judges sole duty to determine if a law has been broken , without regard for extenuating circumstances and the like , and levy the harshest possible punishment . 
  of course not , that would n't be justice at all . 
  all that should matter is the truth of what happened , including the extenuating circumstances and such . 
  i 'm just afraid that a jury system too easily devolves in a popularity contest , that juries are more easily swayed by an emotional argument instead of a rational one . 
   first of all why the hate ? 
  i 'm sorry if i came across as hateful , was n't my intention .
