  d66 is quite okay : [ d66 on privacy ] ( https://www.d66.nl/standpunten/privacy/ ) ( ex . 
  they too want to stop fingerprint registration , limit data retention and actually give cbp some power . ), 
  granted all the other parties ( except for the pirate party ) pretty much suck in this regard ( with the pvda sucking least ) .

  i 'm not so keen on citizen juries , we do n't have them here and we seem to do just fine without them . 
  do n't see what benefits it would have either , sure there is the `` judged by a jury of your peers '' principle but a lot of my peers are dumb or uninterested or both , `` judged by a professional judge '' seems to have worked out fine so far . 
  -- i wonder if crowd sourcing offers any good ideas for a modern participatory government . 
  using some kind of government run non-anonymous web forum to create a really short feedback loop between the politicians and the populace seems interesting to me . 
  maybe combined with a google docs style system where people can see the politicians work , comment on that work , raise potential issues with it and suggest potential improvements/changes ? 
  sure it would require a lot of transparency but i 'm in favor of that anyway . 
  edit : clarification , parliament would still be the ones to vote on legislation . 
  mind still boggling . 
  then again i am a member of greenleft , all those views are basically antithetical to mine . 
  yup , why people still vote for them boggles the mind . 
  it 's about amsterdam in particular . 
  still though , better late than never . 
  anecdotal evidence is anecdotal . 
  according to this [ nrcnext article ] ( http://www.nrcnext.nl/blog/2011/09/30/hoe-erg-is-de-homohaat-in-nederland/ ) ( a reputable source , but in dutch ) 36 % of anti-gay violence in amsterdam is performed by people of moroccan decent , this is clearly an over representation ( since they only make up 16 % of the overall population ) but still less than anti-gay violence by the natives . 
  granted the situation could be different in scandinavia but i would n't expect it to differ much . 
  ( not to mention that composition of the anti-gay crowd means absolutely nothing . 
  simple example , if 1 % of muslims are anti-gay and 0 % of non muslims , 100 % of anti-gays are muslim . ), 
  remember this does n't apply to court mandated blocks ( like the piratebay ) . 
  it 's mainly to prevent isps to block/throttle competing services . 
  so your ips ca n't block/throttle youtube in favor of it 's own video streaming service . 
  tl : dr ( or rather summary in english ) : since 2000 the aivd has been intercepting mobile phone traffic , storing it and searching it for certain keywords . 
  ***** ca n't say i 'm that surprised but the way the minister of justice [ reacted to questions from parliament ] ( https://www.bof.nl/2013/06/11/teleurstellende-wanvertoning-opstelten-over-prism-schandaal/ ) is appalling ( again business as usual that guy 's performance has been [ pretty horrible ] ( https://www.bof.nl/2013/05/02/dutch-hacking-proposal-puts-citizens-at-risk/ ) ) . 
  interesting thing is that some of these statements appear to be in conflict with what the minister of home affairs [ has been saying ] ( http://nos.nl/audio/515485-plasterk-privacy-is-een-grondrecht.html ) . 
  they 're from different parties , so it is n't that surprising . 
  but this may become yet another point of contention within the coalition , combined with the recent conflict about the budget , i would n't be surprised if the cabinet falls this year . 
  edit : then again i would n't have been surprised if the coalition fell the day after it formed , there are few coalitions more diametrically opposed than pvda-vvd . 
  ( sure pvv - `` any non-vvd party '' , especially pvv-gl , would probably be worse but the pvv is a total joke . ), 
  it 's mainly agriculture , hence it has a relatively low population density , lelystad is clearly visible though . 
  let 's not forget the anti-lgbt protest france , it 's not just the muslims who do n't like the gays . 
  ah thanks , was wondering what was really going on !, 
  heh , flevopolder is gone . 
  wait what ? 
  how do you get a sonic boom that overtakes the object that caused it ? 
  ( well i suppose the train could have slowed down . ), 
  to be fair though `` blume '' is n't that good of a password . 
  edit : oh hell , it 's a video from 2009 . 
  both parties pretty much seem to agree on foreign policy , bringing it up during is pointless for either of them . 
  and i 'd hope some general empathy towards human beings would be enough to make the public care , or do they like being responsible for the [ deaths of 200 to 300 children ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drone_attacks_in_pakistan#statistics ) by drone stike ? 
  of course rationalization and denial are easy . 
  i do n't know where you 're from but here in the netherlands it does n't appear to be that bad . 
  sure we have the occasional case of a corrupt , incompetent or dishonest politician but each time either their constituency or opponents are prepared to tear them a new one . 
  due to the large number of active political parties ( ~ 15 parties on the ballot last election iirc , 10 of them have seats in parliament ) voter mobility is quite high so parties actually have to keep their constituents satisfied or they simply walk away . 
  what do you mean ? 
  oh damn they 're still around ?!, 
  ( they also appear to be using google for [ their search results ] ( http://startgoogle.startpagina.nl/index_ilse.php?ts=&amp;start=0&amp;position=1&amp;q=reddit ) . ), 
  aw come on not every politician is a politician , if you know what i mean , some of them are in it for ideological reasons . 
  ( yup the proper enemy bit was silly . ), 
  eh , we 'd survive without google , might even give the eu it sector a little boost . 
  ( but yeah it would be mighty inconvenient . ), 
  i 'm not sure it is quite that bad , but it does feel a lot less tolerant . 
  ( what with the recent rise of anti-islamic populism and such . ), 
   more specifically , the eu data protection reform should ensure that the eu is able to tackle situations such as prism through its data protection rules with a clear provision on territorial scope -- ** non-european companies when offering goods and services to european consumers , will have to apply the eu data protection law in full ** - a broad definition of personal data , clear responsibilities for processors and strong rules for international transfers . 
  sounds like this thing may end up being in direct conflict with the usa 's patriot act shit , will be interesting to see how it plays out . 
  where does it say more spending and military ? 
  cause i ca n't find it anywhere in that article . 
  remember folks :  the [.com ] domain was originally administered by the united states department of defense , but is today operated by verisign , and ** remains under ultimate jurisdiction of us law ** .

   the scary thing is that apparently 50 + % of americans do n't have a problem with their government actively spying on everyone and everything outside the usa as long as it does n't breach their 4th amendment rights . 
  well that 's nice . 
  what 's worse is that they do n't seem to give a shit about extraordinary rendition , indefinite detention and drone strikes either . 
  [ bits of freedom - nederlandse overheid broedt op eigen aftapschandaal ] ( https://www.bof.nl/2013/06/10/nederlandse-overheid-broedt-op-eigen-aftapschandaal/ ) they suggest that the netherlands is about to be hit by a wiretapping/spying scandal of its own . 
  our government is apparently preparing to create a massive indiscriminate internet wiretap , while a commission that was supposed to determine the legality of the tap ( do n't worry they will probably rule in favor of the tap ) is n't supposed to deliver its report until september . 
  not to mention that it 's going to be outsourced to two foreign businesses , nice systems ( isreal ) and accenture ( usa ) . 
  will it be a scandal ? 
  i doubt it , if any people have perfected the idiotic `` i do n't have anything to hide '' attitude it 's the dutch . 
  someone posted [ this link ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/microsoft-admits-patriot-act-can-access-eu-based-cloud-data/11225 ) further up in the thread . 
  while it 's about microsoft 's europe based cloud data i would n't be surprised if it applied to google as well . 
  way to cherry pick your examples . 
  it was bought by microsoft . 
   the company is based in paoli , pennsylvania , united states in greater philadelphia . 
  from the [ duck duck go wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duck_duck_go ) . 
  so it is n't a non-american alternative . 
  yeah people with minimum wage jobs usually ca n't afford that choice . 
   the proposed rule would prevent e.u. 
  countries from capping sentences for any type of hacking at less than two years . 
  meanwhile the maximum sentence possible for cyberattacks against `` critical infrastructure , '' such as power plants , transport networks and government networks would be at least five years in jail . 
  it 's a bit confusing but i think they 're talking about setting a minimum `` maximum sentence '' . 
  ( that the maximum sentence for hacking should at least be 2 years , 5 years in case of critical infrastructure . ), 
  afaik reddit will only notify you if you 're submitting the same link . 
  if it 's the same story but at a different news website it wo n't . 
  and do n't worry , repost happen . 
  sure there is , just compare the number of known cases of corruption , that ought to be a solid indication . 
  it 's a bit easy to just claim that both sides are equal . 
  especially when most of the corruption cases that reach the news ( afaik ) involve right-wing politicians .
