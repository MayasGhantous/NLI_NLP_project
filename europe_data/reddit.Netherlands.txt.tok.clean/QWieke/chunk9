  i 'm even a member of a political party !, 
  ( not an active member though . ), 
  i was just pleasantly surprised , apparently i forgot all that political outrage actually turned into law . 
  there however are politicians/parties i really dislike , mainly vvd , pvv , cda , sgp & cu . 
  mostly for political/ideological reasons . 
  perhaps the [ stars changed ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/05/neelie_kroes_consulted_astrolo.php ) . 
  their [ wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vvd ) describes them as conservative-liberal , it 's weird that it does n't need to be an oxymoron . 
  i decide to check if those two ( ivf and sex change ) are also covered in the netherlands . 
  could n't find a real solid ( government ) source on sex change , but it [ appears to be covered as well ] ( http://www.transvisie.net/component/content/article/134-veel-gestelde-vragen/198-veel-gestelde-vragen-7 ) . 
  frankly i 'm not sure if ivf ought to be covered , but sex change should be . 
  those people have enough problems without having to pay for it as well . 
  i know kroes is dutch , she also is a vvder , so i 've always been skeptic about her . 
  [ she did n't used to like net neutrality . 
  ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/kroes-attacks-dutch-net-neutrality-rules-3040094084/ ) ( apparently she changed her mind at some point . ), 
  we were the first eu nation to pass net neutrality laws ?!, 
  awesome !, 
  ( or something along those lines . . ), 
  jup , flevoland consists of the flevopolder and the noordoostpolder . 
  sounds like flevoland to me . 
  see i did retain some of the things i learned during french class !, 
  i would n't assume so , given that the link leads to an anti-islam article . 
  but that would require the member states to sacrifice some of their precious sovereignty !, 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's what neoliberals do in general , they 're a blight on civilized society . 
  mmmm , we 're doing better than i expected . 
  must be all the cycling . 
  ( or other effects of a high population density . ), 
  i am surprised however by the difference between ourselves and our neighbours ( belgium in particular ) . 
  is it due to industry or lifestyle ? 
  oh and `` oh merde '' translates to `` oh shit '' . 
  to be fair though during the 2nd world war he was clearly on the side of the allies . 
  ( he married juliana in 1937 . ), 
   my brain ca n't comprehend how people ca n't see this as acts of inividuals . 
  there are some really pervasive cognitive biases that color the way the percieve the ingroup ( the group an individual indentifies with ) and the outgroup ( the others ) . 
  see [ ultimate attribution error ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultimate_attribution_error ) , [ fundamental attribution error ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fundamental_attribution_error ) and [ actor-observer asymmetry ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/actor%e2%80%93observer_asymmetry ) . 
  basically that thing you did , considering a person 's situation , is n't something people tend to do ( especially not considering folks in an outgroup ) . 
  ( we used [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.de/social-psychology-thomas-gilovich/dp/0393932583/ref=sr_1_2?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1369571294&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=9780393932584 ) in one of my social psychology classes , iirc it has multiple chapters on racism and the likes , quite interesting and depressing . ), 
  of course not they 're part of most european 's ingroup . 
   the riots in london recently showed how wiling people are to blame these events on the character of certain individuals and social groups , without any interest in addressing the underlying cause . 
  sounds like the [ fundamental attribution error ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fundamental_attribution_error ) or maybe the [ actor-observer bias ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/actor%e2%80%93observer_bias ) . 
  there is a lot of research ( and as a result a lot of known biases ) on in/out-group dynamics . 
  ah yeah , that does seem to be taking it a bit far . 
  ah right , my bad . 
  it 's bonk , our minister of social affairs ( who visited the neighborhood due to these claims ) , local politicians and local police force all deny the claims of a `` sharia triangle '' . 
  say the rioters ? 
  not the entire socio-economic/ethnic/religious / whatever group they belong to ? 
  slipperly slope is n't an argument why these specific laws are bad . 
  like i said , we ourselves have a number of similar laws and nobody seems to mind them . 
  ( sure the motives of politicians involved may be bad , but that does n't invalidate the laws themselves . ), 
  the sales time ban does n't apply to bars and restourants . 
  ( not according to [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ez1t4/turkish_parliament_passes_bill_limiting_sale_of/ca5h9z4 ) . ), 
  how is are these laws actually horrific ? 
  they seem quite reasonable , a lot of these laws ( or similar ) are actually adopted in the rest of europe . 
  ( they do n't allow alcohol ads in france . 
  we have a minumum drinking age and do n't allow drinking and driving ( and so does most of europe ) . ), 
  blasphemy laws are utterly bonkers but what does this have to do with the alcohol related laws discussed here ? 
  pretty sure australia was considered a part of brittain at the time , what with it being a colony at the time . 
   sweden is nowadays called `` rape capital of europe '' . 
  first time i heard that . 
   also the swedes who do n't like the carburning and stood up for themselves got instantly arrested while the carburners got watched from a distance . 
  got any english sources for that ? 
   the fairphone needs 5,000 pre-orders in order to begin production , and retails for a total of ** $ 325 ** ( $ 436 ) . 
  that price included taxes , however and what you get for that is an ** unlocked , 4.3-inch ** smartphone running ** android 4.2 ** , powered by a ** quad core ** processor . 
  it has an 8 megapixel rear camera , and a 1.3 megapixel front facing shooter , with ** dual-sim ** trays for easy carrier switching and international travel . 
  granted i 'm not up to date on the latest phones , but is n't that pretty good value for money ? 
   late 90 's / early 20 's . 
  that confused me for a moment , did n't you mean 00 's ? 
  whatever he does , it ai n't funny ,, 
  ah , woosh on my part then . 
  note the dutch flag flair . 
  of course a riot will never be calm . 
  one riot can however be calmer than an other one , though maybe less violent is better way of putting it . 
  and now the rest of the world learn english just to avoid being yelled at . 
   they are now saying that the riots continue but calmer . 
  how can a riot be calm ? 
  calmer \u2260 calm . 
  same way 100 k is hotter than 0 k without being hot . 
   do n't you mean immigration policy ? 
  do n't know if they exist , but if there are other ways of obtaining a citizenship we should probably harmonize those as well . 
  pretty sure that would be illegal due to [ belgium 's anti-racism laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgian_anti-racism_law ) . 
  ( note that it covers incitement to discrimination , hatred , violence , etc. ), 
  fine by me , would n't be surprised if more than 3/4 of the text and speech i process every day is english already . 
  oh yes , a lot of them seem more reasonable once you get into the details . 
  ( this one is understandable from a consumer protection viewpoint , though apparently consumers disagree . ), 
  is it just me or are 90 % of these ridiculous laws people get outraged about actually proposals of ridiculous laws ? 
  in varietate concordia !,

  mmm , i wonder if strategically placed wave farms could be used , in addition to generation electricity , to reduce coastal erosion . 
  i mean i would expact that sapping some energy out of waves would have some further effects . 
  though i would n't be surprised if the amount of energy the plant generates would n't put a proveribial dent in the amount of energy the waves contain . 
  it 's about outdoor bathing water , so rivers , lakes , coastal areas , etc. 
  i 'm pretty sure these are n't automated captions , they were added manually . 
  as erwinmts said this version does support subtitles . 
  there 's a subtitle button at the bottom right of the video area . 
  thing is , i would n't deny the existence of homophobic minorities ( some of which will be of foreign origin ) , but do n't the other countries ( like the uk and belgium ) have these kind of people as well ? 
  we rebrand it [ newtonmass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isaac_newton ) ? 
  so blame the foreigners ? 
  is n't this ~ 6th time this survey data has been posts in the last couple of days ? 
  would n't a country were overt racism is n't tolerated be less racist than a country where it is ? 
   how some europeans stereotype one another , in one chart plenty of european countries left out of that chart/study . 
  would n't be surprised if the vvd did n't support this initiative .
