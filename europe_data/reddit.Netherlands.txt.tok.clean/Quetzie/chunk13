   not to break the circlejerk or anything , but do n't you think they would have conclusive evidence by now if the russians did it ? 
  do you have a shred of evidence for any alternatives , / u/putinhimself ? 
   all it says is women should cover up all it says on the veil is that the wives of mohammed are to be veiled , after a situation of them getting harrassed in the streets of the village . 
   but if you were familiar with the dialogue surrounding this phenomenon well , people outside of the uk are n't , so quit arguing as if they do and they are being impolite for asking an honest question , jeez . 
  maximum sentence for americans who fuck up european geography is 1 year , coincidentally . 
  exactly . 
   he 's been a rather successful and effective president for the russian people and what does that say about the russian people ? 
  another day , another british threat of leaving the eu . 
  if britain was an so , this kind of behaviour would 've been considered abusive . 
  usa arming isis ? 
  more accurately ; usa arming all kinds of knobheads in the region the past decade , some of which have subsequently become part of isis , taking the equipment with them . 
  you might even argue that they have * stolen * these armaments . 
  not even saying what the usa did is n't despicable and wrong , and that they should 've known better but you make it sound like us and isis officials came together with scones and tea to talk about arms deals . 
   espite islam prohibiting them not completely clear actually . 
  wine is explicitly forbidden , and by way of analogy other alcohol as well . 
  i do n't think there is as much consensus on if this also applies to cannabis as well . 
  a better anaolgy for how muslims treat cannabis would be how christianity has treated alcohol : sometimes prohobition , sometimes used as a sacrament . 
  4 lions ? 
   death cult that is islam oh please , that is hyperbole . 
  i get you are mad , but islam is n't a ` death-cult ' by any means . 
  i 'd widen it even . 
  children ? 
  sure . 
  women ? 
  cool ? 
  old people ? 
  welcome !, 
  middle-aged men who are starting to turn grey ? 
  yeah sure !, 
  young men aged 16-30 ? 
  turn around please . 
  yes , it is discriminatory . 
  yes , it is unethical in theory : but if it keeps the people safe . . ? 
  i do n't know . 
  surely would n't want to be the politician suggesting it though . 
  iz joke . 
  edit : also , got you the first time . 
  no need to repeat yourself dude . 
  bit cowardly coming from you , poland . 
  do n't your people boast on how they deal with muslims ? 
   little to no contact with the opposite sex . 
  fair point that is often overlooked . 
   it borders on dictatorship . 
  no , it just * is * . 
  turkey functions more like a republican dictatorship than an actual modern democracy . 
   it 's the law pushed by socialists which will allow the richest to get advantage of it so you are saying it is a law pushed by * capitalists * ? 
  nevert in the article did it mention the ethnicity . 
  it only mentioned the religion . 
  doing some further digging you would 've found out it was middle-eastern christians . 
  he is half right , half wrong : it is large groups of immigrant christians from muslim regions . 
   downvote me all you want , it does n't change the truth the truth of the matter is that it is mainly due to * immigrant * christians ( and maybe some muslims , i do n't know for sure but i * would n't be surprised * ) . 
  there is no way that it is mainly a problem for ` ethnic ' swedes . 
  even the ethnic swedes that do so are the ones that have been converted to the specifically american styles of christianity like mormonism and evangelical pentacostalism . 
  so yeah , it * is * due to foreign influence in this case . 
  learn to face the facts . 
  i am actually pretty sure that europe ( and the rest of the western world ) was more or less the same in this regard untill wwii . 
  for some reason , westerners stopped doing it during the cold war period , setting them apart from the rest of the world . 
  i think medieval period is way to early though , even when going by earliest possible period of time : i 'm pretty sure widespread use of sitting toilets and public benches are in some way related to this , as well as people living more inside and less outside . 
  my earliest guess would be around the industrial revolution for that reason . 
  but i really do n't know exactly . 
  it is one of those things people do n't tend to mention in history books because it seems * sooo * obvious to everyone alive at the time . 
  [ all over the world ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1401/867214701_dcd8ede195.jpg ) , people are actually more prone to [ squat ] ( http://www.markpieciak.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/san-man-squat-crouch-lg.jpg ) . 
  it is a more natural way to sit for humans than sitting on chairs for instance . 
  however , since a lot of people on here are paying more attention to the western world ( america/europe/australia ) where people do n't * ever * squat for some reason , squatting * seems * like the outlier . 
  the only ` white/western people ' who have continued to [ squat ] ( http://new2.fjcdn.com/comments/even+putin+does+slav+squat+but+he+_258a899f375a33dd735f30422e5b1d0d.jpg ) like normal humans are eastern europeans ( i.e. 
  ` slavs ' ) , and therefore it is very much associated with [ them . 
   this is going to become semantic yes , extremely so . 
  way to much , as horseshoe theory is not an ` academic theory . ', 
  and honestly , if you do n't * get * it 's common usage by now i do n't think you ever will because you are focussing * way * to much on the insignificant details . 
   that 's like saying mao and hitler were the same just because they were both dictators . 
  exactly . 
  that 's part of what it is saying : even though one is x and the other is y on the spectrum , in the end they are both just dictators . 
  you are getting lost in ` the same ' , you are taking it to mean that they are ` exactly the same ' , while what people mean with horseshoe theory is that they are very much alike in how radical , intolerant and prone to violence they are . 
  extreme sjw theories about cultural appropriation and the like are actually pretty * racist * . 
  extreme feminist theories about the women can actually get pretty * sexist * against women . 
   just because socialists and liberals are democrats does n't mean we have to propose some kind of theory and claim they 're the same . 
  i do n't even understand what you are trying to say here , as liberals/democrats/socialists mean different things in different countries . 
  yeah , that is a perversion of the feminist theory of ` the subaltern/other can not speak ' . 
  in essence it stipulates that oppressed people can not voice their plight , which makes them even more opressed . 
  giving a voice to the ` oppressed ' can alleviate this . 
  what it * does n't * mean , but what a lot of sjw-idiots * think * it means it that only the voice of the oppressed is necessary . 
  thing is , by silencing you just turn the situation around and make a new ` other ' . 
  in truth , * both * are necessary . 
  opressed people should be given the agency to voice their plight as they have an insight into their opression the ` oppressors ' do n't . 
  however , ` oppressed ' people often times lack emotional distance and are therefore prone to focussing on the small things and not on the general fluctuations of power and long-term effects . 
  i do n't see how what you are saying is contradicting me ? 
   i find i can not possibly tolerate that idea and i never will . 
  exactly , that is what i 'm saying : you do n't have to tolerate the * idea * , but tolerate the * person * . 
  in the case of people actively trying to kill you in horrible ways , you do n't have to stand by idle : but actively going out against them and murdering them in equally horrible ways just makes you exactly like them . 
  restraint at all times and compassion when it is possible : compassion does n't necessarily mean that you have to harm yourself in the process . 
   while lecturing me about my privileges ( working + student loan ) and how i am acting and thinking wrong in oh so many situations let me guess , you are a white male ? 
   do n't fight , you 're actually much closer than you think they * are * more similar in a way . 
  yes , their * opinions * are opposites , but they are the * same kind of people * using the * same kind of tactics * . 
  that 's what horseshoe theory stipulates . 
   the one thing we should never tolerate is the intolerant . 
  i do n't like this sentiment at all . 
  honestly , i think it is examplary of why people are getting so intolerant these days . 
  if you stop tolerating the intolerant , you become an intolerant yourself . 
  example : wilders says : do n't tolerate intolerant islam !, 
  leftist : do n't tolerate those intolerant racists !,
