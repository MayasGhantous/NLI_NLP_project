  take your armies elsewhere , see if it helps funding american healthcare ( another common argument i am sick of ) . 
  predictable response that ironically shows you * do * care . 
  washington is upset ? 
  good . 
  let 's see how much you like it when the tables are turned . 
  oh hello mr maffiosi . 
  here to extort us by threat of violence again ? 
  so was i. 
  exactly , a joke . 
  from what place are you shilling ? 
   is it just me who find this shit scary ? 
  nah , there are a few other in this thread who are being too sensitive about this as well . 
  you two are getting worked up over a silly joke , poor sensitive souls . 
  lol, 
  dude , it is a joke . 
  you mean high 1 surely . 
   the government said lol . 
   many religions contain similar backward and archaic concepts . 
  name me one other modern worldreligion in which the main prophet ( ultimate source of wordly authority ) is a warlord and not a mystic . 
  this is n't the case in christianity , judaism , hinduism , buddhism , shintoism , daoism , confucianism , sikhism , jainism but maybe i am overlooking one ? 
   nothing is won from forcing people to stop doing something . 
  they will do it extra out of spite . 
  i would do it . 
  case in point : when the germans banned the danish flag , the danes went to the trouble of [ breeding red & white pigs .

  but is it a * burqa ? 
  * veiled face is the part we are focussing on here , not veiled hands/feet/hair / waists . 
  i 'm sorry , but british girls * are * kinda known as the ` americans ' of europe on the continent . 
  modern day portoguese version of john snow . 
  i wore a [ djellaba . 
  ] ( http://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/8549276/whitegold-djellaba-small-hand-embroidered-mens-moroccan-djellaba-morocco-da29969d-ebb6-4f8a-bd64-47d9acec334e_600.jpg ) got me some weird looks , even at the festival i was at , but it is the most comfy piece of clothing i have ever worn in ` extreme ' heat . 
  if you hate sticky sweaty clothes ( even airy shirts and wide pants get sweaty ) , overheat easily and have the skin of a vampire this thing is absolutely ideal . 
  i know i must seem a bit mad , but it really is this amazing . 
  in direct sun , 40 ^ ^ o c , people huffing and puffing and sweating around me , i would normally be one of the worst of them , yet i barely broke a sweat , i was * completely comfortable . 
  * it really spoiled me , if it was n't for the obvious social stigma attached to it i would wear these things every freaking day of the summer . 
  they really are that good . 
   all benefits i do n't think ` all ' benefits could ever be outweighed . 
  i just find it hard to understand your train of thought , and i assumed this was in part due to the structure of your sentence . 
  i am not a native either , so i assure you , i am familiar with things like that . 
  ah , this i understand . 
  fuck you too !, 
  whut ? 
  i do n't think i mentioned a caliphate ? 
  i am sorry , maybe it is because of your broken english , but i fail to understand you . 
  are you saying school is bad for children because going to school is mandatory ? 
  let 's just agree that you and i live in different worlds . 
   they can choose not going to school ... eh ? 
  maybe we do things differently around where i am from , but ` going to school ' is pretty much mandatory , which is mostly a good thing . 
  neither do they choose to be black ? 
  i fail to see your point . 
  i do n't know specifically , it is just purges of [ group x ] every other year either way . 
  huh , was n't there a purge in the police like way before that , years ago in 2013 ? 
  it was , mohammed b. even left a note on his body to ` send a message . ', 
  if it sends a message , and it is a message of terror ( i.e. 
  this is an enemy of islam , not : this guy is smelly lol ) , it is probably terrorism . 
  all is fair in patatje and oorlog . 
  maybe because they do n't come from broken homes : girls coming from those places act and cause societal ills out as well , just not murder and violent crime . 
  figures . 
  brandenburgers are halfway there anyway . 
  rheinlander might not like it though . 
  dutchmen do n't indulge in marijuana as much as other nationalities do , it is just not illegal over here . 
  germans smoke more than dutchmen do . 
  i thought the point was that guinea pigs are n't actually pigs ? 
  they 're rodents . 
  usually only for people who have ' a little extra bacon ' though . 
   you honestly think they care about being ridiculed caring about what others think of them is the main motivation to become jihadi 's . 
  they want to be respected/feared , not laughed at . 
  g\u00fclen is erdogan 's second favorite sacrificial goat , just behind ` the west . ', 
  who is the aggressor ? 
  ah yes , when erdogan purged the police-force , filled it with provincial loyalists justy in time for the istanbul riots . 
  from the perspective of gulen , they are the good guys , and erdogan is the bad one . 
  who is purging who ? 
  i already said this , but in the * nice attack * they * were n't . 
  * they were * a * victim among many other more prominent in numbers , like the french themselves for starters , islam is not * the * victim of the nice attack . 
   muslims should n't be compared with jews or shinto or even hindus well , i just did , i did so yesterday , and the year before that , and i will probably continue doing that , as i am a student of religious science . 
  it is kinda what we do , comparing religions and by doing so finding out what ` religion ' really is ( abbreviated ) . 
   christianity is the only religion you can compare with islam numerically . 
  why not ? 
  [ christianity numbers 2200 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major_religious_groups ) , islam numbers 1600 million , which is a difference of 600 million . 
  hinduism and chinese folk religion both clock in aobut 1000 million followers , which is within the same range of islam as christianity is : though tightly interwoven with the countries india and china , practitioners of both can be found all over the world , and they are starting to attract more non-indian/chinese followers . 
  buddhism is almost as missionary and international as chr and isl , since it 's early days : buddhist are spread out all over the world , and count in the 500 millions . 
  i honestly have no idea why someone would say that islam ca n't be compared to other major world religions , sorry . 
  what is your point exactly ? 
  ah ok , i can get behind that !, 
   it just happens in brown countries so nobody in / r/europe gives half a shit . 
  i would n't say inherent racism is the main cause of the ` not giving a shit ' . 
  a bit cheap as accusations go . 
  there is * way * more going on that just ` they are brown ergo we hate them and do n't mind them being bombed . ', 
  i am not saying they are n't * a * victim of the whole situation . 
  * but * claiming right after the nice attacks that it mainly sucks because of what people will think of muslims is rather inconsiderate , as they were not * the * victim of the situation . 
  secondly , they lack religious figurehead or even just spokespersons to manage pr . 
  this is partly because of the organization of the religion itself , sure , but even buddhists ( who are even more divided ) have the tibetan dalai lamai who more or less single-handedly takes care of buddhisms pr with ` the west ' ( and he is good at it , not a hundred years ago the appreciation for buddhists and other ` occult ' eastern religions was much lower than the western regard for islam , and he has had a hand in that ) . 
  yes , yes , the media is biased i am sure , but i am * sure * that if there * were * large authorative western-based muslim-organizations , people would be overjoyed if they could explain what is going on . 
  because people * do * want to know as of now , this all remains * way * to local . 
  i 've been to a few of those local getherings with people from the neighbourhood in the mosque talking a bit , but this kind of stuff only reaches the people who are actively looking to be placated . 
  i 'm sorry , but i just refuse to believe that , even though i know there are challenges of capital , conflicting narratives , religious authority , but if a bald monk somwhere stowed away in the himalayas can catapult himself into an excellent pr position , why are there no muslim equivalents ( out of the billions of muslims there are ) who can do this ? 
  maybe there really is no way it can work , because of organizational difficulties : but even then that does not reflect well on islam 's ability to get with the times . 
  sore point : the jihadi 's * do * seem capable of organizing themselves and sending a message . 
  as of now , people in the west are forced to conclude that there just is no one to talk to , no authorative institutions within the religion that are doing all they can to combat terrorism , it sends a message that ` islam is not to blame for muslim terrorists , ' which is the worst pr there is . 
  it forces people in the west to just go to forums ( like / r/islam ) to get a feel of what the ummah thinks about this , and that is ofcourse filled with amateurs and other people who you do n't want to take care of your pr : conspiracy rants about the west and about jews , flaggelants who bemoan the good name of the religion , and sure , also a majority of people who just think ` that this is just all so fucked up man , you know , i love everyone !
