  fyi , there are multiple studies that older individuals * especially * of * herd animals * still contribute significantly to the natural survival ability of their herd . 
  and to come back to your start of your argumentation , i think you are being a bit of a twat when you immediatly disregard all who might disagree with you as ` uneducated ' , especially considering your argumentation itself provides no evidence that you are anything more than a complete novice in this particular area of knowledge yourself . 
  in english it is ` wisent ' btw . 
   calm down you should calm down , as the language you have used so far is much more emotional than mine . 
   i am talking about dutch society well , i am part of that . 
   they 're so delusional , it 's ridiculous . 
  calm down . 
  ... wow , it has been a while since i 've met a single person echo-chamber . 
  did you actually read * anything * i 've written ? 
  you are arguing as if i 've said things that i have n't , and the things i have said you twist around for your own nefarious purposes . 
  i will not debate you any further , cause you are a moron and would n't even try to understand it anyway . 
  have a nice life little troll . 
   freed slave aka not a slave anymore , because of st. nicky . 
  and then what ? 
  are you also supposed to * eat * it under water ? 
  at some point , the stuff has to come above waterlevel , is all i 'm saying . 
  not to mention that the historical inspiration for zwarte piet is a nubian slave ( named peter ) * freed * by sint nicholas , which is the exact opposite message . 
  you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  why does this russian want to know ? 
  has more to do with rocket league . 
   especially in indonesia we were talking about europe ? 
  i do n't see the point of dragging indonesia in this discussion on recent refugees and migrants : i already stated that i am discussing the muslim minorities in european countries : i am not writing a thesis you know , which would be necessary if you really want to take these into the debate as well . 
   many indonesian women married to dutch men you might not know this as a non-dutchie , but most indonesians living in the netherlands are n't muslim : most of them were christians , knil soldiers , ` half-bloods ' ( do n't know how to put it more delicately ) and other indonesians who were in a way connected to the nederlands-indische government : few muslims , mostly people who thought they were going to suffer under native indonesian rule . 
  additionally , these groups were small and already half-integrated upon arrival , only a few of them are still a definite minority culture . 
  most have just become part of the now enriched majority dutch culture . 
   not something practiced by turks , it is something practiced by kurds . 
  ethnographically sure , nationally they are turks , as in ` hailing from the nation turkey , ' and i used the word in that context , as most dutch including the government and media do , as the distinction is for very small groups and they are not writing a paper for university ( in which case i would 've specified as well , but this is reddit )  again , i realize what is in the scripture . 
  i 'm just saying it is wrong to say ` muslim women ' as if that 's the case for all muslim women . 
  my only issue here is the generalization , nothing else . 
  it is equally facetious to claim that ` muslims do n't drink alcohol and do n't eat pork , ' but i find that most peopel do n't balk at ` generalizations ' like that , as in these cases most people tend to assume that the speaker does n't mean to say that no muslim ever does . 
  why is n't this generosity extended when someone slaims ` muslim women are not allowed to marry non-muslim men ' ? 
  because there are always exceptions , duh , is n't it natural to assume that there are ? 
  we are all more or less adults who have lived life and know ` there are always exceptions ' to everything , right ? 
  why does it bear repeating over and over again , unless the initial comment explicitly states that it is true for ** every single one ** or just uses the world ` all ' . 
   but non-muslim men can not go after muslim women . 
  and upon rereading , the initial comment does not explicitly state that ** all ** muslim women are like that , so as an adult is n't it natural to assume that the speaker does n't even * intend * to say that there are no exceptions ? 
  that 's why people are downvoting you , not because you are taking issue with ' * all * muslim women ' but with ` muslim women ' . 
  again , if not otherwise specified is n't it the mature thing to do to read ` muslim women ' as meaning ' * generally , * muslim women ' ? 
  only a few select linguistically brilliant people tend to be able to naturally speak in a way that attaches the intended amount of qualifiers to most of their statements . 
  again , this is not a university paper were every single word can be scrutinized , and i think it is ` bad faith ' to interpret the intended message of the person you initially responded to as to mean ** ` all ** muslim women . ', 
  maybe next time if you are faced with a statement like the op , just politely ask them if they mean alll muslim women , that will clear up the situation much faster . 
  now we have wasted more than hundreds of words to come to the conclusion that in fact , the op probably did * not * intend all when making the statement ` muslim women ' . 
   but most christians do it anyway even if that would be the case ; is it forbidden to consume alcohol in islam ? 
  yes , it is . 
  i think you 'd have to agree with me on that point . 
  still , there are many muslims who * do * drink alcohol . 
  in fact , this moroccan guys i know drink alcohol regularly . 
  does this suddenly mean that islam allows drinking alcohol ? 
  no it does n't . 
  same with marriage to a non-muslim . 
  yeah sure , a few * do * but this is not a usual situation at all . 
  the women who do marry non-muslims are a minority and actively go against scripture , not to mention prevalent sociocultural norms of the different muslim communities that usually favour the interpretation of scritpure . 
  the point remains : islamic scriptural interpretation and the most prevalent sociocultural norms in muslim immigrant communities ( the people we are talking about , we are n't talking about indonesian muslims in indonesia ) actively discourage marriage between a muslim woman and a non-muslim men . 
  anecdotal example from the other side : in my country ( netherlands ) there has a been a string of ` honour-killings ' a decade ago where turkish muslim men killed their sisters/cousins by decree of the family for associating with non-muslim men . 
  either way , if you study the case files of muslim women married to non-muslim men , you will see a pattern in that the amount of these women being blacklisted by their family or even killed is * way * higher than for other comparable groups , and this is solely based on the fact that they are a muslim women married to a non-muslim man . 
  i applaud you are from a family of muslims that are so progressive that they , i assume , positively welcomed that christian man in their family ( how would your family welcome atheist/irreligious men though ? 
  ) , and i understand that you as a muslim ( i assume ) would like to speak in defense of yourself/your family and faith , but honestly , you do n't make a good argument , as i think you fail to show us that the practice is opposite or in the least ` indifferent ' to scripture . 
  i think you damn well know it is n't as welcomed/accepted as you try to play it off , in practice . 
  you just described 30 % of all danes . 
   2 ) american tourist revenue is more beneficial to the eu economy than eu tourist revenue is to america . 
  i suspect you are right . 
   1 ) americans are significantly less likely to illegally immigrate to the eu than the reverse not too sure about that one . 
  let 's just wait and see what happens when trump wins ... :p, 
  yes , ` liberals ' are exactly like that , just like how conservatives like you are all racist bigots lacking higher education . 
  come on man , get over yourself , and do n't use these playground arguments . 
  i assume we are all adults here ? 
   jesus , you just devolved rapidly into personal insults you devolved way before i did , both on this conversation and in real life . 
   your christian brothers lol  thanks for confirming my belief for me . 
  same . 
  degenerates , all of you . 
  because it is derived from the word for a young nobleman ? 
   i suppose you would n't know about that . 
   never seen thank you for confirming my point . 
   these countries were surpressed by everyone , but especially by turks , for * hundreds of years . 
  * do n't try to minimize it with a weak ridiculous deflecting argument like what you are showing here . 
   except that 50 % of us are normal cobnsidering you yourself might describe your persona as ` normal ' i seriously doubt that . 
   classy you do n't deserve class , you deserve the same kind of attitude you showed them , disgusting hypocrite neanderthal that you are . 
   that 's why you see so many dutch people whining about spaniards and being extremely hostile in general ? 
  oh please . 
  you misunderstood completely . 
  the netherlands used to be something of a colonial empire , and yeah , indonesians tend to be kinda hostile , though i suppose you would n't know about that . 
  i do n't let it get to me though , i think it is rather immature and vile to call the people my country has surpressed for hundreds of years with lingering effects ` neanderthals ' for example . 
  that would be classless behaviour . 
  btw , newsflash for you probably , but from where i am sitting and what i have seen of turks doing last couple of weeks ( and before that too honestly ) the turks seem much more deserving of the descriptor ` neanderthal ' or ` broken people . ', 
  not that i would engage in that kind of racism , since i am not a turk . 
  lol . 
  legacy of being an empire does that . 
  i understand that perfectly fine . 
  if you hate it so much , be the bigger person , or are you suggesting that * they * should do the pandering and bridge-building all alone ? 
   depending on how you define ` the turks came and conquered ' thank you for providing your intepretation , but i am not here to argue wether this is the only option . 
  merely pointing out that the user before might have a different interpretation . 
  if you disagree with that i kindly ask you to take the matter up with him/her , as i am not interested in this discussion ; in my opinion you come off as a little too combative on a subject i do n't specifically care to get in an argument about . 
  why are you repeating me yet acting as if you are disgreeing with me on some level ? 
  needlessly petty comment . 
  shame on you . 
  thing is though , what you are describing is a deliberate attempt to erase a culture and a people and that meets the definition of genocide . 
  genocide = / = bloodbaths , but it usually does end that way once the targeted population has been properly defanged . 
  it is only one of the preconditions though , and the others are equally important . 
  let 's put it this way : if i sterilize every turkish woman and man on the planet i am commiting genocide on your people . 
  theoretically this can be done without any violence occuring .
