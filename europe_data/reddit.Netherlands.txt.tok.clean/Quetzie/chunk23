  in my experience it is only the french , italians , spaniards and the british though , because when germans and scandinavians are annoying i understand why , so it does n't bother me as much . 
  does that answer your question ? 
  if we want to punch up , germany . 
  when we want to punch down , belgium . 
  minor correction ; * evidence * , there is no a in it . 
  so you come in here to troll often , or . . ? 
  well , languages are there to communicate , so choose the one that let 's you talk to the people that are more likeable . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ german, 
  frankly , i might be off a bit , but it seems to me that the most jarring thing about brexit for most brits was to have america fawn over them and trying to convince them to become the n ^ th state of the usa . 
  not as likely as trump getting elected president . 
  i like how you are still arguing that the germans * must care * about you guys when it comes to football . 
  they do probbably do to an extent , but not more than they care about portugal or spain . 
  i 'm sorry , the germans are just * our * frenemies when it comes to football ; it is not your fault , it is us , really . 
  not a vegan bud . 
  like i said , a multitude of reasons , i warned you it was boring , but here i go anyway :p pigs are not environmentally friendly . 
  no farm animal is , but pigs are even worse . 
  additionally they have less uses than the others . 
  pigs are smarter than any other farm animal , and therefore imprisoning them hurts them more than cows etc. , relatively speaking . 
  i do n't ` enjoy the company ' of pigs at all , they smell really really bad , while i can easily tolerate cow/chicken/sheep etc. 
  pig meat is the least healthy and richest in unhealthy fat of all the usual meats , generally speaking . 
  pigs are genetically closer to humans than the other farmyard animals . 
  this matters because of diseases : diseases like the bird flu became dangerous to humans because of mutations they gained while in contact with pigs , and this is n't the only case : in a way , pigs are a step on the ladder for diseases in other farm animals to become dangerous to us humans . 
  all in all , i just think the world would be better of without pigs as a farm animal . 
  i do eat wild boar , because most of these reasons i mentioned do n't really apply to wild boars , only to pigs . 
  it was a pretty easy decision as i never much cared for pig meat anyway , especially ` delicacies ' like ` stegt flaesk/speklap ' , i always disliked that . 
  way too much fat , weird texture . 
  but please , if you like pork , do enjoy it , and do n't let me spoil your fun !, 
  oh , it does n't need to be halal specifically , but halal automatically means there is no pork in it , so in the case of sausages and such i often find myself in the halal isle ; almost all suasages are made from pork unless otherwise specified . 
  nope , not for any religious reason whatsoever . 
  only pork for multiple reasons , environmental , moral , personal , health-related , etc. 
  ( no religious reasons ) long and boring story , really . 
  i only ever miss spare ribs and salami ( though i found halal salami a few years ago ) . 
  [ speklap ] ( https://spitwerk.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/speklap.jpg ) ( bacon-strip ) in dutch . 
  a bigger piece would be just ` spek ' i guess ? 
  do n't know much else , sorry , i do n't eat pork anymore . 
  i did n't know that , it is a pretty neat fact . 
  thanks !, 
  i kidn of hesitate to answer this question , as i think it is pretty fair to say that the ` countries ' i name would be a bit more similar when compared to regional differences in other , more expansive countries . 
  the netherlands is at heart a sort of federal state though , and there is still some lingering influence from before that ; the netherlands has always been a bit more divided in seperate units than france for example , more like germany ( talking hre days , 1450 anno domini ) . 
  the cultural divide , faded as it is , still resembles this . 
  surly northern frisia ( friesland + groningen + drenthe ) , no-nonsense eastern gelre ( gelderland , overijssel ) , catholic southern brabant ( noord-brabant + limburg ) and ` confident ' randstad holland ( n+s holland , zeeland and baby flevoland ) . 
  the only one missing is utrecht : utrecht city is definitely part of the ` randstad ' , but it 's surrounding areas are all very halfway something else . 
  not a very distinct personality . 
  wether this means it is ` quintessentially dutch ' ( middle of the wheel and all that ) or just ` bland ' , is not for me to say . 
  personally i think utrecht is very * gezellig * , so fine as it is as a distinct unit . 
   i am half german quarter russian and nobody says anything about it . 
  while people who live 30 years in the netherlands with a muslim root get send back to their familys country . 
  what has happened is that people who have been denied after a lenghty procedure have been sent back . 
  this is normal policy : asylum seekers request asylum , sometimes it gets denied . 
  if denied , they get sent back . 
  there is not a single person who has been sent back on account of being a muslim , like you imply . 
   while people who live 30 years in the netherlands with a muslim root get send back to their familys country . 
  small correction : this is n't actually happening . 
  as of yet he only talks about it , but it isn '' policy . 
  last time we met , * you * were the asshole . 
  just trying to return the favour bud . 
  if you want to be treated nice , do n't be an asshole yourself . 
  never really heard of it . 
  this means it probably was n't a hit in the netherlands : we tend to prefer scandinavian political drama , like borgen and the bridge . 
  house of cards is the exception . 
  i think this may be due to the what you describe as the ` political porn ' - factor : we prefer realistic and less ` clean ' political drama . 
  not to mention that our politics are * completely * different from american politics : and not in a particularily inspiring way . 
  oh god , i 'm beginning to remember why i have you tagged as ` hopeless americentrist ' . 
  no one is associating [ * plastic * cups ] ( https://metro.scene7.com/is/image/metronl/nl_pim_1598779001001_01?wid=184&amp;hei=184&amp;fmt=jpeg&amp;qlt=80,1&amp;op_sharpen=0&amp;resmode=sharp2&amp;op_usm=1,1,6,0&amp;iccembed=0&amp;printres=72 ) pers\u00e9 with american culture , people only associate the ` iconic ' [ red cup ] ( http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/files/2012/01/cup.jpg ) with american party culture . 
  not a very ` succesfull ' hermit then , is he ? 
  yeah , exactly . 
  again , not afraid * i * will be * shot , * but i do n't want to go through the authoritarian hassle at all : stitting completely still , not speaking unless spoken to , no sudden movements , etc. 
  i mean , i am meeting another human being , a civil servant even , not a fucking bear !, 
   only being curious here . 
  what wars england vs netherlands are you referring to ? 
  yeah , exactly my point , it was such an embarassement in total for the english it seems like you have collectively forgot about it , haha !, 
  as for the first being a defeat for the netherlands : it is true egland forced a monopoly with it 's colonies , but at the same time , it did n't get everything it wanted , and it was the on who started the war , so i do n't count it as a total victory , and i imagine it started the english feeling quite salty , salty enough to start a second war . 
  what the other guy said about the third war is n't completely true either ; yes , the french officially declared war , but england was the one who betrayed the netherlands . 
  england , sweden and nl were in an alliance against the french , and england secretly made a deal with france and egged france on , probably spurned by the defeats in the second anglo-dutch war ( raid on the medway was in the 2nd ) . 
  the whole reason for the start of the 3rd war was an english false flag operation . 
  i mean , did you ever wonder why you english have * so many * dutch slurs , as much that putting ` dutch ' in front of a word can automatically make it an insult ( dutch oven/wife/etc ) ? 
  i mean , you do n't even have that sort of level of disdain for the french/scottish/irish , haha !, 
  they are not a fond memory for the netherlands either , as the third war in 1672 ended with such a total defeat that we were completely ruined , it is now as * het rampjaar * , or * the year of disaster * , effectively ending the dutch golden age , new world expansion , etc. 
  you know the ` dutchmen traded new york for suriname , what a bunv of idiots-spiel ? ', 
  the dutch did n't want to at all , nieuw amsterdam was forcefully taken over without a declaration of war by the english , and suriname was just the retalliation of the dutch , resulting in a disadvantaged peace for the netherlands ( 2nd war ) , as it ended because neither could do much fighting anymore . 
  otherwise the dutch would have taken back nieuw amsterdam , they knew very well what a great potential it had , as it is now ` the big apple ' , new york . 
  i can understand completely that this is n't taught in schools , because it is impossible to spin it in a way that england does n't come off as a moustache twirling impotently raging villain . 
  or a schoolyard bully nicking sweets from the nerd , getting tripped a couple of times , and coming back for even more with his new ` friends ' . 
  yes i am a bit salty about it . 
   i assume the level aggression varies widely with the neighborhood . 
  i suppose so , i think it is fair to assume you ca n't generalize the whole of the states . 
  however , when i visit the states , i probably wo n't go to rural alabama , if you catch my drift , haha . 
   but if i was in europe that it might cross my mind more . 
  why ? 
  invasion by whom ? 
   do you all just have faith in your militaries to protect you domestically ? 
  pretty much . 
  well actually , being dutch , i have more faith in the combined force of our allies as well . 
  netherlands against the world seems like a * very * unlikely scenario , not since 1672 . 
  england has pretty much forgotten the humiliation of losing two wars against us and only winning the third with help from both germans and the french : germany is our bro , france is not a bad cat either and spain does n't impress me . 
  that 's basically all our enemies , they are now mostly allies , so i 'm not concerned about any wars : whatever war will/might come , we wo n't be alone in it . 
  preparing for an invasion just seems like very counterproductive behaviour , as trust is the most important currency in a society , especially in the netherlands . 
  and what are we going to do anyway ? 
  we are open terrain , densely populated : a guerilla war is not an option anymore , even if we were all davy crockets . 
  when i see it mentioned what you speak off , ' i wo n't go to the usa because i will be shot ! ',
