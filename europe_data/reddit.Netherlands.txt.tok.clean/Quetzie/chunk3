  muslims treat the quran differently than how christians treat the bible , though it might be nearly indistinguishable in practice for a layman . 
  evangelicals would be a proper candidate for that , i can certainly see why you would mention them . 
  still , this has more to do with how it is proper difficult to know someone 's beliefs based on actions alone , or even words alone . 
  even so , there is a simple difference in practice that points to this ideological difference : muslims do not like to translate the quran precisely because of their relationship with how holy the text * itself * is . 
  protestants like patty robby you mentioned * do * work with translated holy scripture , probably the king james edition . 
  lastly , i 'm getting a bit fed up with how you assume i do not know what i am talking about . 
  even if you disagree and think i 'm not properly utilizing the information available there are much politer ways to go about it than ` y' all just do n't know shit ' , which is kind of the vibe i am getting from you . 
  you could have started out with : ` but what about the evangelical christians ? 
  they are well known for taking the bible very literally , how is that different from how the muslims do it ? 
  i do n't see it ! ', 
  then you would 've made the same point without coming across as a somewhat stereotypical yank , and i would n't be enticed to give a few textual stabs back . 
  it would be a lot friendlier . 
  you are right , but there is a little difference . 
   fortunately , the church 's legal ability to enforce that for civil purposes was removed in 1982 this touches upon why it is different in islam . 
  most cultures/religions enforce a form of equal religion in marriage , as you 've said . 
  however , it usually is n't a a part of the primary texts or laws ; it is usually open to interpretation , depending on how strict the religious authorities are at the time . 
  christians , in their early days for instance , were rather fond of marrying christian noblewomen to pagan kings and the like , for alliances ( and sneaky missionary purposes ) . 
  a muslim could n't in good fatih do this , as it is explicitly forbidden in the quran , and that book does n't allow opposition , it quite literally demands submission . 
  haha absolutely , that 's the part where i have trouble even * entertaining * the idea of the truth of islam . 
  ` you literally believe in an infallible and timeless text written in a * human language * ? 
  a language that has been shown to be developing and changing since it 's inception ? ', 
  it is impossible . 
  a fallible language can not produce an infallible text as per matter of definition . 
  simple logic . 
   there is a huge contingent of christians who consider that statement to be blasphemous . 
  yeah , as a student of religious sciences i 'm going to need you to source that , as i think you are a bit confused on definitions . 
   for them the bible is the inerrant literal word of god , transcribed by man , but under direct divine supervision . 
  yes , that is exactly what i said as well . 
  divine supervision , filtered * through people * by way of the * holy spirit * . 
  note that there are multiple people and they sometimes contradict , which led theologians to conclude that there is a human factor involved . 
  also , a lot of the accounts are visions and not literal text dictated by god . 
  lastly , by way of the trinity , another nuance is added . 
  god spoke as jesus on earth ( which was recorded later ) , the holy spirit keeps flowing through the faithfull ( prompting new ideas ) and the father is even more of a mystery ( in short , it is more complicated than that ) . 
  these are all nuances that islam lacks with regard to texts . 
  it might be a belief of some uneducated laypeople , but official church policy ( no matter the denomination ) is that they are divinely inspired , and people who believe the same as muslims do about the quran are * heretics * . 
   belgian strawman arguments . 
   muslim women who marry outside their religion are not `` moderate '' they ca n't be muslims even , as it is literally forbidden for a muslim woman to take a non-muslim husband ( other way around not so much ) . 
  they 're heretics at best . 
  not really , they are both abrahimics but the level of loyalty to the literal text is different . 
  christianity consists of writings ( law and myth ) that are earlier than the religion itself , whom are contrasted with the more general precepts given by christ . 
  however , christ never wrote anything down himself , and to show this there are four * different accounts * of the same story . 
  all in all , christianity does a good job of contradicting itself , and most importantly it gives different kinds of authority to different texts : though a lot of writings in the bible are considered divinely inspire , they are n't the exact word of god . 
   and let 's not forget that muslims believe quran is the absolute last word of allah , which sets islam & christianity apart . 
  the bible is a work of humans inspired by god and deemed to have been fit by authorative clergymen who are also ` inspired ' . 
  the quran has a literal copy of itself in heaven , it is not inspired , it is literal truth of god . 
  there is no room for mistakes or human failing , and that 's why the text itself is in effect divine and ` magical ' . 
   b-movie star rutger hauer yeah , he is * our * aa-movie star . . : /, 
  other way around as well : kids between the ages of 6-10 are starting to get a belgian accent !, 
  i think it is fair to show * why * [ tatjana ] ( http://www.powned.tv/images/other/simicbesch2.jpg ) was actually [ famous . . ] ( http://static.veronicamagazine.nl/srv/gallery-1024/www/images/entertainment/nieuws/2012-10/tatjana-simic-flodder-amerika.jpg ), 
   as i know how too many leftists are when they are `` defending soviet union from attacks of brainwashed capitalist pigdogs '' yeah , i do n't really get what kind of people you are referring too , i guess we do n't have ` leftist defending the soviet union ' around anymore were we live . 
   that is a straw man claim er , you were the first to go strawmen by suggesting that / u/waz _ met_jou is defending the mass murdering of the ussr . 
  to be fair , in living memory russia tried to do exactly that to germany , so i can see why a german would be touchy about it . 
  or czech , hungarian , romanian , etc. 
  maybe because it is an american issue at heart , and therefore not really appropriate to discuss it here , especially if the whole site is positively buzzing with spaces to talk about american stuff . 
  nice try though , e for effort . 
   well r/europe [ 1 ] totally okay with cia and guantanamo no they are n't . 
  america is an ally though , we do n't want to piss it off . 
  why ? 
  because russia mostly . 
   `` white by accident '' only a common saying in your weird little social circle . 
  so what is '' your '' reading of the whole scenario ? 
  you do n't get the point i made , are mad at me , and do n't want to debate , you turned it into a personal fight . 
  i am not going to debate you further , i made my point , just not to you , but that does n't concern me anymore . 
   also , `` i will suggest you 're a russian shill , but am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt '' do n't purposefully misread me , i did not say that at all . 
  i made a point on how stupid it is to use big words like these to discredit the opposition . 
  i merely threw back at you what you did to others , and then basically said : see how stupid that was ? 
  for both of us ? 
  this means i took it back immediatly , even more , my whole point was that me callign you a shill would be stupid , * as stupid as you are for calling this ` propaganda ' * . 
  i find it extremely disingenious * of you * that you are misreading and misrepresenting my comment . 
  but again i will give you the ` benefit of the doubt ' ( something you obviously do n't ) and i will just assume that you are being a bit silly instead of malicious . 
  as for the propaganda : for it to be propaganda it has to be intentional , and i do n't think that is the case here : it is merely a simplified rapport intended for the general public ( on fucking facebook , not in national geographic ) , and a link is provided with actual numbers . 
  propaganda is a * very * big word to use in such a case as this , even if the font * was * intentional . 
   i am only using the term because it applies in this case . 
  no it does n't , as myself and others have already explained . 
  why not adress those arguments , or at the least try to strengthen your own arguments for it being propaganda ? 
   maybe you should address the matter at hand why do n't * you ? 
  *  instead of attacking my character . 
  i did n't attack your character , i attacked your ` tone ' . 
  it was unbecoming of an adult debate . 
  even more , i explicitly stated that i did n't think it was a character flaw but just a momentary lapse in judgement , for understandable reasons :  i 'll just assume you are using hyperbole though , but i do n't think it is appropriate in this case . 
  i 'll take that back now . 
  ` propaganda ' is a word that should be used with care , or else it will become a meaningless term . 
  the link provides info on the why , and it does n't lie about that , it admits the hurt in dairy and vegetable . 
  calling * that * ` propaganda ' makes you look like a putin-puppet ( see how damaging it is to use these kind of words ? ) . 
  i 'll just assume you are using hyperbole though , but i do n't think it is appropriate in this case . 
  the [ magpie ] ( http://www.jcsolaris.nl/alfred_kwak/alfred_jodocus_kwak_-_pikkie_de_ekster.jpg ) was a kleptomaniac . 
  you are thinking of dolf , who was half crow and half blackbird , but presented himself as a full crow . 
  half crow and half blackbird , judging by this vintage shot of his [ parents . 
  ] ( http://www.jcsolaris.nl/alfred_kwak/alfred_jodocus_kwak_-_ouders_van_dolf.jpg ) all german though , haha !, 
  or the one with the white queen of chess and the bottomless pit ? 
  karbonkel was an absolute abomination . 
  i am so glad we only watched [ ` moffel en piertje ' ] ( http://images.poms.omroep.nl/image/197561.png ) at school . 
  i guess i 'm alone in this , since i 've never heard anyone else admit it , but that ` dragon ' scared the crap out of me . 
  i hesitate to call it a dragon because i loved dragons and dino 's when i grew up , it ca n't be that , but that thing from the never ending story really freaked me out . 
  it looked unnatural and creepy . 
  anyone else with me on this ? 
  and getting a blowjob from a fat toothless hooker . 
   in america we 're dealing with this thing where people are identifying as all kinds of gender identities , they are already here as well . 
  dutchmen take to the internet like maggots take to a carcass , and tumblr is darn popular . 
  do n't worry about them , they are just a bunch of cancersufferers .
