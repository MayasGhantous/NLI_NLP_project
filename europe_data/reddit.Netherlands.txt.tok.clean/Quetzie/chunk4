  this trial was n't about proof , it was about punishment and justice . 
  ** edit ** i never said it was * feasible * goal . 
  not russia . 
   it 's incredibly hard to tell if that 's a joke or not from text . 
  you are right , it is a play on a saying in english that only the netherlanders seem to know , being : ` god made the world , but the dutch made the netherlands . ', 
  it is n't a widely known joke outside of our country i guess . 
  one of my favorite bits of history is the time when a dutch captain , converted to islam as murat reiss , with his crew of barbary pirates from north africa raided viking villages in iceland . 
  if it was a movie i would n't have believed it !, 
  wow , that looks nice !, 
  rather have a vacation over there !, 
   but before people move to using bicycles , they 're in cars , yeah , and before little children can adequatly ride a bicycle , they will likely fall a couple of times , and they will have to spend some time on it . 
  thing is , once you can , ` you 'll never forget how to ride a bike ' ( dutch expression , not sure if it translates ) i think it really shows if the ` best ' and oft repeated argument against bicycle lanes is that people ` do n't like change and they will complain ' . 
  in that case , let 's do away with cars first : they are so loud and frightening , golly !, 
  those damn trains too , they make the milk of the cows go sour , everyone knows that . 
  they all go so fast too , like twice as fast as a horse !, 
  that ca n't be safe !, 
  who in their right mind would even * want * to ride in those cars and trains ? 
  that 's why it will never work in ( x-country ) !, 
  actually , dutch women have the biggest natural boobs in the world ( plastics do n't count ) . 
  boob size is correlated with being tall , so this should n't be a surprise really . 
   when i then dare respond with equal hostility , because it was just a joke . 
  thing is , they probably * really * see it as a joke , and you really do n't mean it as a joke , you intend it to be hostile . 
  so it is not exactly equal , and you are weird for thinking that introducing hostility is the right answer . 
  either ignore it , banter right back or ask them to stop . 
  also , i object to your generalization that all other dutchmen are  idiots who come over here to celebrate carnaval everyone who celebrates carnival is an idiot . 
  ( this is a joke  ), 
   find people who hate limburg man man , volgens mij lul je uit je nek . 
  sterker nog , je denkt dat dit een breed gedeeld sentiment is in nederland ? 
   hate i think you 'd be hard pressed to find someone that actually hates limburgians . 
   immediately earns you the ire and distrust of a lot of people in the randstad . 
  i think the banter broke this guy . 
  you really sound like you take this shit waaay too seriously . 
  you always turn into an old lady when you are hungry . 
  personally i think it is actually worse , based on the misconception that ` dutch ` men are just germans ( deutsch ) . 
  i personally prefer netherlanders . 
   lousy celtics who let themself get romanized ?!, 
  more like ` brandenburger ' or ` prussian ' , as those were a dominant force in the unification of germany , as i recall . 
   no , it 's true , academia leans leftwards . 
  i 'm not denying this , i agree . 
  worded it a bit weird i suppose , but i meant that the * reason * for academia to be left leaning is opposite of what the other guy suggests : that it actually is a  poor reflection on right-wing ideals . 
  as you 've said . 
   prejudice impairs research . 
  i am right with you on that !, 
  prejudice does indeed effect your research and opens you up to some weak spots . 
  the thing is , the people that discovered this prejudice were * post-modern feminists * . 
  take the human body for instance : lots of research on the male body , which was then extrapolated to the female body , which resulted in less than optimal treatment . 
  but now those scientists that grew up with these theories are doing research , and they are a bit skewed the other way : this becomes most apparent in the fields were your ideology can be most influential , like the social sciences . 
  at the same time , there is an ongoing movement to espose the prjudices of the last generation , as is the natural cycle of things . 
  in 5-10 years time , there will be a noticable paradigm shift , and it will be tryign to balance out the current one . 
  this is just how it goes is science , there is nothing unnatural going on right now . 
  and it is ok to call out a bias * when you see it * , but denouncing the entire academia out of hand will get you nowhere . 
  ** tl ; dr ** there is not a movement in one direction , only natural flux , and generalizing to the entire ` academia ' is hyperbole . 
  not really , all it shows is a correlation between academics and the left . 
  another causal explanation for this correlation might just be that people who are smart enough to enter acedemics are also more likely to be more ` left ' because it is a ` smart ' thing to do . 
  an effect of acedemic ` brainwashing ' , what you are getting at i presume , is far from the best causal explanation . 
   our amazing national team . 
  * snort *, 
   their degrees do n't offer them much weight on political matters . 
  except for , you know , the stuff they studied to become knowledgeable enough to be considered teachers in the first place . 
  i always love this argument coming from ` the right ' though : ` academia has a left-leaning bias ' . 
  i would argue the other way around . 
  thank you for the comprehensible explanation . 
   it 's rather pervasive through all parts of our culture and also the reason i cringe seeing all these unification dutchies on here . 
  lot 's of dutchies are catholic as well though , so why is that a problem ? 
   except that 99 % of the population would assume that apes mean modern day apes . 
  well , then they 'd be wrong , so stop pandering to them . 
  and explain it to them like we are doing to you . 
  you are right , that is what theistic evolution is , i agree with you wholeheartedly . 
  however , the danish minister stated that he believes god still has a part in evolution , not just ` setting it in motion ' , and that means he supports intelligent design , not just theistic evolution . 
  though i concede that the minister might not be aware of the difference , or even care about it much , as he also expressed a certain disinterest in the subject by waving it off . 
  do n't know for sure though . 
   would that creature be classified as an ape ? 
  yes . 
   humans have not evolved from apes ; apes and humans evolved from a common ancestor the species of ape that modern great apes ( including humans ) descend from thinks you are wrong by being a tad nitpicky about this . 
  theology and law are the oldest ` studies ' in european universities . 
  so it is a leftover of simpler times , you could say . 
  it also has to do with education : theology is in difficulty on par with other social sciences . 
  it is a lot like philosophy , but just limited to a specific philosophy that it studies . 
  i ` lll give a little history . 
  first there was theology . 
  this is not a science , but it has always been practiced in universities , just like law . 
  theology , is , in a nutshell , examining a religion on it 's own terms : usually people refer to * christian * theology , but it could work for all arbrahimicc that study their own religion ( i.e. 
  study to be a religious teacher/priest/rabbi / etc , broadly speaking ) . 
  typical question : what is the importance of the trinity ? 
  then you got ` comparative theology ' in the colonial times , which was the study of strange religions compared to christianity and discovering how all those other religions were completely inferior to enlgightened christianity . 
  in short , comp . 
  theology is examining a religion on the terms of another religion , which usually means that the one being examined is concluded to be inferior . 
  typical question : does this religion also acknowledge the trinity ? 
  pretty new is religious sciences ( i do this ) , which is trying to examine the phenomenon religion on a scientific/secular basis , preferrably without prior judgements , as much as humanly possible . 
  typical question : what is religion , really ? 
  also , he says that god is involved in the process of evolution , making him someone who espouses intelligent design , which is not compatible with evolution . 
  so yeah he does implicitly say that he does n't believe in evolution . 
   if you study religions then i suppose that you are familiar with the concept of logos ? 
  i do n't see the relevance of jesus being ` the word ' in light of this discussion . 
   thus nature selecting would be dependent on god . 
  feel a bit like a broken record here : if person thinks that a ** transcendent intelligence ** ( like god ) is a necessary part in the ongoing process of evolution , then he/she is not a believer in evolution , but in intelligent design , which is pseudoscience . 
   it sounds odd to me that the concept of evolution would entail the concept of `` not including god '' why is that weird ? 
  which scientific theory does ? 
  would you say someone believes in gravity if they say ` well , it is not just mass alone that attracts , there is a transcendent intelligent power that is controlling this process ' . 
  no ofcourse not , this person has a very flawed understanding of gravity .
