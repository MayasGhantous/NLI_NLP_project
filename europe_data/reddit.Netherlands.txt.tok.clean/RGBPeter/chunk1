nah the foundation is pretty solid . 
  true . 
  bunch of coke snorting fishermen . 
  thanks for the info . 
  i always love a good polder story . 
  til !, 
  i never knew the waddeneilanden stretched all the way to calais . 
  the grass next to the runway looks greener than most golf courses . 
  relevant polandball is the / r/europe equivalent of relevant xkcd . 
  i pulled my data from [ this source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf ) ( page 21 ) . 
  it says 29 % of dutch people are capable of holding a conversation in french . . 
  i dropped my french for frisian . 
  ( apparently it counts as a second foreign language in schools in the province of frysl\u00e2n ) it was super easy compared to french , seeing as it 's my native tongue and it has very little grammatical rules/spelling oddities ( the spelling is largely phonetic ), 
  the only roadblock we are facing is that windmills are kinda shit at pumping water in mars thin atmosphere ... 
  i also watch it with norton 's commentary , he is absolutely savage . 
  watch it greece ... or all those beautiful island your county has will become polder cities with only a fresh water coast . 
  what we did to [ urk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urk ) can happen to lesbos ... ( i 'm kidding , i love your islands . 
  i 'm visiting one next month ), 
  you are correct , i 'm just pissing on my southern neighbors . 
  deme and jan de nul are nothing to snuff at when it comes moving large amounts of dirt from the bottom of the sea and depositing it in a more useful place . 
  while belgium does n't try to act flashy and builds fancy polders or turns a sea into a fresh water lake just to show off , they are certainly capable of it . 
  port 2000 in le havre might be smaller then the maasvlakte in rotterdam but building it is just as complex . 
  and i 'm pretty sure that if deme and jan de nul were to fuse they would be way bigger than the dutch royal boskalis westminster . 
  our nation was in a state of ecstasy when we heard curiosity discovered signs of water on mars . 
  our top scientists are working on adapting the curiosity sky-crane so it can land dyke-building and polder-draining equipment on the red planet . 
  i hear martian soil is rich in iron and great for growing tulips . 
  rome can suck it ... 
  this picture proves that all roads lead to moscow . 
  that body of water only exist because we allow it to exist !, 
  that 's because the belgians are real slouches when it comes to sealing land from the sea . 
  they are just sitting there eating waffles and chocolate while the sea is eroding their coast . 
  most protrusions you see along the dutch coast are artificial . 
  the one you see above the rhine-delta is an extension of the harbor of rotterdam called the maasvlake , it sticks out even further now because we build a [ second one ] ( https://www.maasvlakte2.com/cache/76962d2c5139f32cb9e653ce2a1cb794.jpeg ) of them after this picture was taken . 
  true , but that guys singing was also a bit hash in all honesty ... 
  you kinda have a point . 
  when ever i 'm in germany i always ask if the person i 'm speaking to if he is oke with me speaking english ( my german is decent , but kinda shit compared to my english ) and most of them will answer back in english . 
  you guys scored a solid zero points when you let [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jemini ) preform in 2003 , so i guess it 's within the realm of possibilities, 
  they can speak american , australian and new zealandish . 
  if people in the uk lean an other language , what is the most common second language ? 
  over here about 90 % speaks english , 71 % speaks german , 30 % speaks french and 5 % speaks spanish . 
  ( 2.5 % speak frisian but that 's not really a foreign language ), 
  this one is outdated . 
  maasvlakte 2 is not included , this makes us look like we are going easy on the north sea . 
  it 's kinda logical that news articles about wilders appear regularly in dutch media seeing as he is a dutch politician . 
  and the foreign news section on nu.nl ( the most popular online news outlet in the netherlands ) has le pen on the first page along side the article about the serbian riots . 
  how much is enough then ? 
  there are also protests in south africa and hungary that need coverage . 
  it 's a shame reddit does n't allow you to change the title . 
  yes . 
  just like how not all people living in germany during the war where nazis . 
  when i think of french people during wwii i think of the french resistance before i think of the vichy regime . 
  what 's up with the random ( what i assume is ) chinese character in the title ? 
  i hope the serbs protesters can feel a slight relive knowing that media outside of serbia is covering the protests . 
  the glorious swedish-norwegian-dutch alliance does not fear the rainbowroad . 
  protestors can ( and should be ) peaceful and behaved . 
  i would take a couple of people holding up signs to form a flag over a couple of people trowing bricks and lighting cars on fire every day of the week . 
  yeah those are not as hard to get your hands on as some people think . 
  all you need to do is ask bulma if you can borrow her dragon ball radar . 
  go to github , download the firmware upgrade , install it and your are good to go . 
  the german bulb also complies with the strictest electrical / fire safety standards . 
  just do n't buy those led bulbs from vw . 
  it turned out they are actually burning coal to produce the light but a come with a chip that tricks the emission testing apparatus . 
  [ mfw i look at turkeys foreign politics over past few months ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/816/393/77c.png ) . 
  russia upset over something ukraine did ? 
  how do they think ukraine felt when they annexed one of their administrative regions . 
  i do n't see the problem . 
  prostitutes in the netherlands pay taxes , taxes go the eu , the eu uses that money to restore cultural heritage sites across europe . 
  i did not hear those people complain when when a centuries old orthodox cathedral got a restoration funded partially by taxes from amsterdam 's red-light district . 
   #migrants ( still ) welcome in germany : survey  but most germans believe other eu countries should take more refugees . 
  yeah nice try germany !, 
  you get all the educated migrants looking for a job at deutsche bank or vw and we get all the refugees from worn torn countries . . or are we using migrants and refugees interchangeably now ? 
  that title is some of the juiciest bait i 've seen in a while . 
  i wish we had ( real ) hills/mountains so we could build our own ship tunnel . 
   western germans the pc term is swamp-germans if i recall correctly . 
  we are working on it , but thinks like that take time . 
  the uk leaving the eu also did not help . 
  we really need that dyke between calais-dover for this to work out . 
  yeah the dutch have a bit of a history with the peninsula . 
  our santa claus , [ sinterklaas ] ( http://www.contrastleiden.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sinterklaas3.jpg ) , does not live on the north pole . 
  he lives in spain . 
  he does not arrive via magical flying reindeer sled . 
  he arrives via boat , [ a boat that sails under the spanish flag ] ( http://www.wos.nl/cwm/fm/userfiles/content/eyecatcher/normal/222227_sinterklaasintocht_maassluis_2015-7683---rode_mijter_company.jpg ) . 
  kids do n't leave milk and cookies out for him when they go to sleep . 
  they leave sugar cubes out for [ his roof scaling parkour horse ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f7/5b/0f/f75b0f188e47187359d2525f4162e61f.jpg ) and they leave out mandarins for the man himself because he 's from spain and people from spain like citrus fruits . 
  that is correct . 
  he does n't think carbon emissions have a huge impact ( he is big on industry and hates it when green parties chose baby birds over more oil refineries ) . 
  i 'm also pretty sure there are some people in the sgp ( cristian conservatives ) that believe climate change is the wrath of god . 
  but they all agree on the fact that it 's happening . 
  if you look at climate change from a dutch nationalist economic standpoint , climate change is a good thing . 
  it 's very bad for most other nations in the world , but a major economic boom for the netherlands . 
  the netherlands is a big player in the greenhouse industry . 
  if droughts cause tomato yields in greece or italy to dwindle it will cause the dutch tomato export business to grow . 
  our greenhouses run year round no matter the the outside temperature . 
  and water it 's an issue because greenhouses can use water from gravity-fed dune desalination systems . 
  if a coastal city of an other country is in risk of being swallowed by the sea due to rising sea levels , what are they going to do ? 
  build hydro-engineering universities , wave-research labs , pay patent fees to dutch companies so they can build their own coastal construction ships and practice for 50 year until they get the hang of building deltaworks ... or are they going to just hire a dutch company to help them out ? 
  in the netherlands lemonade you make form a syrup/concentrate is called [ ranja ] ( http://www.jetdrinks.nl/images/upload/userfiles/alle_smaken_ranja_website.jpg ) . 
  this might very well have it 's roots in the portuguese word `` la ** ranja ** '', 
  nice !, 
  people in your country also call fresh water sweet water .
