  i voted on a party in opposite side of the political spectrum during the last elections but i 'm not at all bummed out with him being the pm for the next ( if the coalition does n't fall ) 4 years . 
  that would depend on the country of origin of the criminal , the crime committed and the country where the crime is committed . 
  but overall , the benefits you will get in prison are worse than the benefits you would get as an illegal immigrant . 
  it just does n't make sense to commit a crime in order to get benefits . 
  yeah our prisons might have excellent health care and other services when compared to the us but the services you get while being dirt poor and outside of prison are even better . 
  homeless people in my country are homeless by choice . 
  the goverment will provide them with housing , basic income , help finding a job , mental health and rehab if they ask for it . 
   mechanisms to prevent poor people from committing crimes to get healthcare and other services ? 
  poor people already get that stuff without needing to commit a crime . 
  frisian , dutch , english fluently . 
  my german is a bit rusty and my vocabulary lacking but it 's good enough to get around in germany . 
  walking on bicycle paths . 
  it 's not a sidewalk , i will run you over with my bike !, 
  calling morocco the ** middle ** east is stretching it a bit . 
  a eu border in the me would not be beneficial for the eu in my opinion . 
  perfectly fine with them competing in eurovision though . 
   what do you like about this sub ? 
  what makes you stick around ? 
  it makes me feel connected to other cultures in europe . 
  i love hearing the opinions of other european nations . 
   what could use an improvement ? 
  i would like if a person commenting without a nation flair gets a automod message that reminds them to set a flair . 
   what do you think about the traffic here ? 
  too many answers , too few ? 
  the traffic is good , it has a nice q : a ratio . 
  ( though the ratio of americans asking questions about the us is quite high some times , but that 's not a huge problem )  would you say your country has a strong enough presence here ? 
  there are n't a lot of answer treads that do n't include a dutchmen . 
  i did not know that . 
  you guy celebrate every monarch that way ? 
  or was willem iii just a really nice dude ? 
  [ willem iii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_iii_of_england ) , a member of the dutch royal house of orange-nassau used to be king of scotland . 
  the french coast also has some pretty impressive wwii stuff . 
  the us should wait until an independent body confirms that the saddam regime is hiding wmd in the middle east before escalating the situation ... **** edit : just looked at my calendar and turns out it 's 2017 instead of 2003 . 
  my mistake . 
  just read `` assad '' were my comment says `` saddam '' and the rest of the comment should be fine . 
  i watch it for the the fancy hats . 
  here is the [ . pdf ] ( http://www.who.int/about/finances-accountability/funding/ac_status_report_2017.pdf ) for addressed contributions by member states of the who, 
  i 'm no expert on eu law but if someone asked me to show them a picture of what a world without net neutrality laws looks like , i would show them this exact picture . 
  this feels like an eu court case waiting to happen . 
  edit does this also mean you cant use apps that are not on this list ? 
  lots of eu nations have a high-tech arms industry . 
  not every nation might able to produce a main battle tank on its own like the us does , but if you combine the talents of those nations you can build a pretty decent tank . 
  imagine a tank that uses swedish active ir camouflage , a french fire control system , a dutch optics suite , a german engine , and a luxurious italian leather interior . 
  and if we lack a certain ingredient , we could always ask the us to sell some of their stuff . 
  for example ; the dutch navy uses a ciws build by a dutch company . 
  it 's all developed in-house , except for the gun . 
  it uses a gau-8 / a avenger ( the a-10 's guns ) because no one build a gun that goes `` brrrrrrrt '' like the yanks do . 
   it might be hard to understand for americans because you guys have n't had a war in 150 years and probably forgot what war really means . 
  before someone plays the `` what about wwi , wwii , korea , vietnam , gulf-war i&ii and afghanistan '' card . 
  i believe he is talking about war within a day worth of driving from your home . 
  i can hop in my car , drive to kosovo and see building with bullet-holes in them that are younger than the cigarette burns in the couch at my parents place . 
  correct . 
  luxembourg , belgium and the netherlands formed a union know as the `` benelux '' since long before the eu . 
  a union with open borders , free trade and shared taxes just like the eu . 
  for me personally , i just see the eu as an extension of that union . 
  yup . 
  the dutch has the line `` we are of german blood '' and `` we have always honored the king of spain '' in it 's first verse . 
  europe has always been a community with strong interconnecting cultural ties dating back centuries . 
  back in the day our king would marry a daughter of the king spain to strengthen that connection . 
  now a days we strengthen that connection using free trade and food safety regulations . 
  that might be where i got it from ... 
   the question is not whether amsterdammers will defend amsterdam but whether they will defend tallinn . 
  tallinn is allot closer to amsterdam than the usa is . 
  but that did not stop 500 dutch sailors from giving their lives trying to sink british ships during the american war of independence back in the 1870 's the netherlands is plural for a reason , it used to be called the republic of the united netherlands . 
  it 's a union of different countries . 
  i 'm from what used to be the kingdom of frysia . 
  i speak a different language than the people in holland and have completely different cultural history than holland ( we were never a part of the holy roman empire for example ) . 
  but that has never stopped my ancestors from fighting and dying when amsterdam was under attack . 
  there is also [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jack_churchill ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that guy was forced to only attack `` when he could see the whites of their eyes '' . 
  that 's because he stormed the beach of normandy carrying only a broadsword , longbow and bagpipes as his weapon . 
  i have never seen an angel that look so depressed . 
  here is my passport , wheel of gouda cheese , wooden shoes and bicycle ... 
  i will see myself out now . 
  if someone asks where i am , tel them i 'm on the south pole crying profusely while i 'm continuously apologizing to the dutch flag . 
  it 's rembrandt van rijn of course . 
  vincent van gogh was 2 centuries later , had completely different style of painting and i 'm pretty sure van gogh was so poor he would not be able to afford a canvas the size of de nachtwacht , let alone the paint . 
  i would go for one of our former oversees territories like suriname , but that is because we have a past . 
  i 'm not sure the other eu nations would agree, 
  inside my country ? 
  [ de nachtwacht ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/the_nightwatch_by_rembrandt.jpg ) ( van gogh ) < = = this is so wrong outside of my country ? 
  [ starry night ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/van_gogh_-_starry_night_-_google_art_project.jpg/1280px-van_gogh_-_starry_night_-_google_art_project.jpg ) ( van gogh ) [ the girl with the pearl earring ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/meisje_met_de_parel.jpg ) ( rembrandt ) [ composition with red , blue and yellow ] ( https://jamestelford.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/00010911.jpg ) ( mondrian ) while not a painter ( lithographs , woodcutting and drawings ) , [ my personal favourite is m.c. 
  escher . 
  ] ( http://d31vc4ph21db4c.cloudfront.net/images/made/escher__relativity_611_586_s.jpg ) that one by friedrich is the definition of epic btw, 
  do you mean like joining the eu or just someone from that country visiting or moving to the eu, 
  human ... and that 's all that matters . 
  being gay in the netherlands does n't really hold a stigma in our culture . 
  what do i care what you do in bed room ? 
  some people like latex and whips , some people like to piss on their partner and some people like some dual penis action . 
  i worked in a gaybar a couple of years ago and i loved every second of it . 
  the atmosphere is so different because their is no `` i like that girl . 
  i better punch this guy next to me to show her how strong of a man i am '' mentality . 
  i get enough of the words to understand what 2 people talking it are talking about . 
  i get the general topic ( like ; they are talking about the weather or they are talking about going out to eat ) but i could not tell you any more than that . 
  though that 's mostly because i also speak frysk . 
  ( frysk sounds more like swedish than dutch ), 
   the eu has no such history to lean on only if you exclude the ~ 2000 years of dying for your king , queen , baron , duke , etc etc. 
  there is a city less then 50 km from the city i live in . 
  we went to war with that city 17 times in the last 1000 years . 
  thousands of dutch sailors lost gave their lives for king and country during the anglo-dutch wars over trivial things like our king not liking the way the english king handled the taxation of nutmeg .
