  i 'll pick a spot that achieves maximum-dutchness . 
  a nice canal , couple of 17th century warehouses , you know the drill . 
  would you prefer a hand/person holding up the sign ? 
  or would you prefer the sign folded and sitting on the ground or taped to something instead ? 
   i ca n't actually ride a bike is it a medical thing ? 
  like are you wheelchair or did you drown and suffered brain damage ? 
  i 'm not taking a piss , i honestly never heard of a dutchmen that ca n't ride a bike . 
   i wish i could though what area of our glorious nation are you living in ? 
  i 've got a pair of training wheels and a spare bike . 
  i would be more than happy to teach you . 
  a love of bicycles , salty liquorice , pickled hearing , rugbr\u00f8d and now i learn your samfundsfag is basically the as maatschappijleer . 
  [ we are basically the same country ] ( http://i.imgur.com/emq2eds.png )  with this point we cover all parties in the parliament , not just the government . 
  yeah that 's the same over here . 
  i just forgot about the word `` parliament '' . 
  yeah my maatschapijleer teacher was top notch . 
  he had a `` eerstegraads bevoegdheid '' so he likely has a masters in politics or something similar . 
  i also chose maatschappijleer-2 as an `` examenvak '' so it could be we went a bit more in dept then someone who only had maatschappijleer-1 . 
   can you tell me a bit more about what you talk about in those lessons and how is it teached ? 
  it only focuses on modern ( post ww2 ) politics in the netherlands . 
  older stuff gets coverd by history classes . 
  some subjects covered by the class include : * trias politica aka `` the separation of powers '' and the concept of bicameralism . 
  * the 4 different elections we have ( 2de kamer , provinciale staten , gemeenteraad and water boards ) and how the results of those elections impact the netherlands . 
  * how voting works ( like what happens if you vote `` blank '' ) and what the requirements are for setting up your own political party . 
  * how a multi party system works and how coalition governments are formed . 
  * explanation of concepts like `` left vs right '' , `` liberal vs social '' and `` conservative vs progressive '' . 
  and terms like `` single issue party '' and `` green party '' . 
  * an overview of the political parties that are currently in government . 
  covering the history of the parties and their current party program . 
  the class also covers stuff that is not politics like the legal system and how/when to apply for stuff like unemployment benefits  normal teachers ? 
  the guy who gave the class was a maatschappijleer-teacher . 
  he only teaches maatschappijleer just like how a maths-teacher only teaches maths . 
   are n't they biased ? 
  i 'm sure the guy votes center-left ( pvda or d66 , maybe groenlinks ) but he never told us his party affiliation . 
  his bias did not show during his teachings . 
  being blatantly biased is kinda hard to do in a county that has 10 + political parties . 
  in the usa when you say you are pro-live you are quickly labeled as a republican . 
  in the netherlands when you say you are anti-eu you could be on the far left ( sp : socialist party ) , far right ( pvv : freedom party ) or close to the center ( cu : cristian union ) parts of the class focused on journalistic pluriformity/integrity and the importance of getting your new from multiple sources . 
  he would start each class by bringing in various newspapers and having us read/debate the deliverance between them . 
  he also made us fact check statements made by politicians/media . 
  like when politician [ x ] claimed that under the leadership of political [ y ] youth-unemployment rose 2,4 % . 
  we would have call the cbs ( central bureau of statistics ) and request unemployment data for the last 10 years to see if that is really the case . 
  he also tried to break our own personal bias/information-bubble and teach us to see trough weasel-words/logical fallacies by having us defend a viewpoint we absolutely disagree with in a debate . 
  yeah we know . 
  a passenger plane was shot down in that region awhile back . 
  193 dutch tourists died in that crash . 
  [ we had to borrow hearses from neighbouring countries to carry all the bodies back to dutch soil ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/24/article-2704010-1ff2e3f900000578-758_964x622.jpg ), 
  we have the same thing in the netherlands . 
  over here it 's called maatschappijleer and maatschappijleer-1 is mandatory in all levels of education ( just like maths , dutch and english are ) maatschappijleer-2 is a optional course . 
  over here we do n't associate the french with cowardliness , it 's actually quite the opposite . 
  the french are more associated resisting , like saying ; `` my kid really hates going to the dentist . 
  when i tried taking him to his appointment last week he flushed my car keys down the toilet like he was in the french resistance or something . '', 
  or belgium , also a fairy-tale . 
   it 's about your family history some people over here are into that stuff as well . 
  but they usually do n't use dna analysis . 
  most european countries have birth/census records dating back centuries . 
  we find it more interesting to know our great-great-great-grandfather was a knight under king redband then to know if we are 3,54 % danish & 33,23 % spanish . 
  i heard a homeless person downtown shout `` belgium is a real country '' i think he was on drugs or something . 
  who the hell believes that baloney . 
  we all know belgium is a storage unit shared between nl and fr . 
  it 's where we keep our back-up citizens stored . 
  it 's always smart to plan ahead , you never know when something bad is going to happen to real french & real dutch people . 
  back in '92 we had a plane crash into a flat in amsterdam . 
  [ wiki link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_al_flight_1862 ) a lot of suspicious stuff happened in the aftermath of the crash . 
  the morning after the crash reports came in of men in ncb suits collecting wreckage and leaving the scene in a unmarked car that had french license plates . 
  in the year following the crash , service personnel and residents suffered strange heath issues ( like 67 % of the people being infected with a strain of * mycoplasma * and people suffering form auto immune disorders ) in '98 a spokes person for the airline publicly admitted that the previous claim made by the airline and the dutch government were false . 
  the cargo in the plane was n't just `` fruit , perfumes , and computer components '' it was also carrying dimethyl methylphosphonate ( a schedule 2 cwc chemical used in the production of sarin nerve gas ) some people believe that the crash was a chemical/biological weapons test and that the men in the ncb suits where mossad agents covering up the evidence . 
  some people belive the plane was brought down by iran in an effort to slow israel 's weapon development by destroying the chemicals and that it hoped the investigation of the crash site would hurt the image of the us & israel in europe . 
  ( the us was violating international law by exporting the chemical to a country that did not ratify the cwc treaty ), 
  i take reddit very serious . 
  i consider it official business . 
  since 1997 it 's officially called frysl\u00e2n, 
  ** almere ** * het afvoerputje van de randstad ... * yeah it 's a nice place to look at/think about but the idea of moving there never crossed my mind . 
  it 's such a boring place to live ( and thats coming from someones who lives in frl ), 
  it 's the worlds largest artificial landmass . 
  it 's build by draining part of the ijssel-lake , an artificial lake that used to be a salt water bay of north sea . 
  the region is filled with colourfull squares of tulip-fields , wind-turbines and has a unnatural symmetry / `` straightness '' to it . 
  [ photos taken from the sky make it kinda look like piece of modern art ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qxqyteu.jpg ), 
  i 'm also fine with them staying in the eu but shit or get off the pot . 
  either hit that article 50 kill switch or do n't . 
  do n't keep us in limbo, 
  yeah . 
  after reading up on the history of the war i 'm quite certain that all the action the peninsula saw post wwii was the bombing of vrsar 's airport . 
  it certainly was n't the the main hot spot of action in the conflict , not by a long shot . 
  but i was under the assumption it did see some slight action during the winter of ' 91 . 
  but it 's also possible that it was a older building with holes with holes from wwii that were left unfixed . 
  it 's even possible the holes were created as a result of some one thinking ;  lots of tourism bucks are getting spend on the coast . 
  maybe i can shoot a few holes in my barn and draw in those gullible tourists that want to show their kids _ `` the horrors of a war torn country '' _ but do n't want to drive their car all the way down to dalmatia . 
   do you guys think countries like netherlands are overpopulated ? 
  densely populated ? 
  yes ... overpopulated ? 
  sure the amsterdam/utrecht/rotterdam / the hague area is a bit crowded , the 3 northern provinces are basically a ghost town . 
  we also have a massive greenhouse industry resulting in an insane crop-yield per m ^ 2 and a food surplus . 
  we could also just create additional land if the need ever arises . 
  1/6th of our country 's current land is created artificially . 
  the dikes surrounding the `` markerwaard polder '' are build and ready to go . 
  all we need to do is turn on the pumps to create 410km ^ 2 of new living space . 
  a while back ( 2004 or 2005 ) my parents took me on vacation to istria . 
  i ca n't remember the name of the place we camped at but it was somewhere around vrsar or pore\u010d . 
  i probably do n't need to tell you that this place is touristy as hell . 
  i was aware that yugoslav wars were a thing because of stuff i saw on the news/learned in school/heard from my parents .
