  i even went to school with both an albanian and a bosnian refugee . 
  the luxurious resorts and fancy hotels build along the gulf of venice coastline make it easy to forget that the grill-house that sells delicious \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i for only a hand full of kuna is located in an area that , a little over a decade ago , was an active war-zone . 
  this fact only really started do sink in when my parent took me on a drive away from the coast and into the heartland of the peninsula . 
  seeing people living in houses that still had bullet holes in them made me realize that the conflict was n't something that a long time ago in ~ ~ a galaxy far far away ~ ~ some remote far away country . 
  but that a town closer to my home than the city of rome has houses with bullet-holes in them younger than the couch we had in the living-room . 
  my house was build somewhere in the 1920 's , parts of it at least . 
  the previous owners added a kitchen extension to it in the late 90 's . 
  it 's a nice mix of new and old with the living room having a stained glass window and a cast iron fireplace . 
  and the kitchen being of minimal design with the wall facing the garden being all glass . 
  the house i was born in was a bit older . 
  it used to be a tollhouse where officials collected taxes from the people using the adjacent canal . 
  the building was constructed 1652 and is considered a national monument . 
  ( my dad told me the house being a monument was a large part of why we moved . 
  every time you wanted to hammer in a nail so you could hang a painting or even when you had a leak in the roof that needed fixing he had to call some government historian dude and ask for approval . ),

  medical marijuana is a thing in the netherlands . 
  [ info link ] ( https://www.cannabisbureau.nl/english ) most medicinal marijuana sold in the usa/ca is grown from cannabis strains developed by the dutch government . 
  or even a. . . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.nedanders.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/aquaduct-610x350.jpg ) and [ this one ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000hv.igodnjta/s/900/900/sms-20130501-1201-a3.jpg ) are also not bad . 
  yes you are correct . 
  it was also cynical , underhanded , calculating , sly , designing , and sneaky . 
  what 's your point ? 
  [ i am also not a constitutional lawyer ] i see it differently . 
  the king gaining duties/privileges because of hereditary means he is not in a in a equal situation as someone who is born outside of the royal family . 
  let 's say my grandfather is filthy rich . 
  when he dies i inherit a large sum of money and stocks . 
  my neighbor 's grandfather is poor and lives on benefits . 
  when my neighbor 's grandfather dies he gets nothing . 
  does this ( in your opinion ) also contradict equal rights . 
  it 's important to keep in mind that the first article of the dutch constitution is not a law about equal rights . 
  it 's a law about ensuring people get equal treatment when they are in equal situations . 
   i 'll never understand the logic of people who build their houses close to the coastline the ground my grandparents house is build on was part of the seafloor less then a century ago . 
  if they move 30km further inland they will still be living below sea level . 
  but yeah building a house 50m from a cliff that is already crumbling while there is perfectly fine above-sea level land available a few miles from the coast is just asking for trouble . 
  it 's kinda like building a house on the base of a volcano while it 's already smoking . 
  the king ( while he is not busy preforming official duty 's ) has the same duty 's and responsibility as regular citizen . 
  when he is busy doing king stuff he is not treated equally be cause he is n't in a equal situation . 
  kinda like how a cop is treated differently when he is on duty , but he treated like a regular citizen when he is not . 
  the netherlands is a constitution monarchy so even the king need to adhere to it . 
  the only exception is that the king does n't have voting rights or freedom of expression . 
  the queen is from argentina . 
  she had to take the same exams to gain citizenship as every one else . 
  the dutch princesses go the the same school as other kids from the same area and pay the same tuition fees . 
  if the king wants to build a large shed in the backyard of his private residence , he too need to file for a permit from the local town-hall . 
  our king is basically just a celebrity we pay for with tax money . 
  and is nice to have a back-up if official international diplomacy fails . 
  ( like when our pm messes up trade talks with saudi arabia to the point where he is no longer welcome . 
  the king can pop over for a low-key monarch to monarch chat, 
  is coastal erosion a large issue for the uk ? 
  is it mostly the the cliffs ( like the ones facing the strait of dover ) that are eroding or is the uk suffering from breach erosion and sand dune destabilization ? 
  is the government actively trying to combat the erosion ? 
  ( building sand-engines , groynes and breakwaters ) or is coastal protection pretty low on the governments priority list ? 
  translated to english : everyone within the netherlands shall be treated equally in equal situation . 
  discrimination based on religion , beliefs , political affiliation , race , gender or other traits is not allowed . 
  there is also a major overlap between / r/photoshopbattles and / r/food do you think people who know how to cook hinder or help ps battles ? 
  i live next to a ( dutch ) airbase . 
  not the same thing as a army post but we do get allot of foreign pilots/ground-crew during nato exercises . 
  they are generally well behaved and friendly . 
  that being said , 15 us airmen visiting a 100k pop town is n't the same as having 1000 army personal stationed next to a tiny village . 
  what is the correct way of asking a boulanger to sell you a `` stick-shaped piece of bread '' ? 
  i never really understood why people hate soldiers . 
  if you hate bp because they are destroying the arctic you do n't start slinging insults at the guy working at the local pump . 
  soldiers are just doing a job . 
  ( as a civilian , my only complaint about soldiers is the amount luggage they bring onto trains/buses . ), 
  what made you start believing ? 
  was it a gradual change ? 
  did someone convert you or did you have a full blown religious epiphany ( like hearing/seeing/feeling god directly ), 
  i share your views on this subject to the point where typing my own top-level response could be considered plagiarism . 
  it 's also shown on pan-european networks like eurosport . 
  i absolutely love watching snooker on the bbc , it 's almost therapeutic . 
  long symmetrical wide shots of the artistically lit table . 
  absolute silence apart from a posh sounding commentator occasionally whispering _ `` marvelous '' _ . 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  i assumed _ go _ was short for _ google objective _ or something similar . 
  is n't go just c++ for fancy people ? 
  low effort . 
  stock video and ugly text in the lower thirds that does n't match the vo . 
  native : frisian , dutch . 
  fluent : english i 'm able to read and understand spoken german . 
  when i try to speak/write german i mess up the grammar and throw in a lot of dutch words ( i try to make them sound german and hope they do n't notice it . 
  they always notice it but they are often to polite to correct me ) they tried to teach me french in school . 
  i was terrible at it . 
  if someone starts talking french to me i can only respond with _ `` je ne parle pas beaucoup de fran\u00e7ais . 
  est-ce que vous savez parler l\u2019anglais ? _ i would love to be able to speak russian . 
  be brutally honest , the only thing that offends the dutch is dishonesty . 
  if someone asks you a question , they want your opinion even if you think it will hurt their `` feelings '' ( girl you have a crush on asks ) q : do you like my new summer dress ? 
  a : no . 
  it makes you look fat , i would return it if i where you . 
  ( being invited to a dinner in some ones home . 
  the host asks ) q : did you enjoy the food ? 
  a : no . 
  it was way to salty for my taste . 
  it looked great though . 
  ( on monday a coworker asks ) q : hey !, 
  how 's it going ? 
  a : not great , my mother passed away on saturday . 
  how was your weekend ? 
  lots of wars happening during that period . 
  the dutch and the english fought in the [ eighty years ' war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eighty_years%27_war ) ( 1568 -- 1648 ) against spain and the [ dutch -- portuguese war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch%e2%80%93portuguese_war ) ( 1601 -- 1661 ) . 
  that superquake you mentioned , is that the lisbon earthquake of 1755 ?
