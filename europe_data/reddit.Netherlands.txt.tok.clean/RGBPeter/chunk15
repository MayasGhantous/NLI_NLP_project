  to be fair , op did ask about historical reasons portugal stopped being a colonial power house and [ i kinda got carried away . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dnabxwb.png ) it does not not happen often that a dutch person can talk about our colonial past without having to mention the whole `` yes , we basically invented trans-atlantic slave trade '' thing . 
  2 dutch multinational corporations ( woc & voc ) caused the portuguese allot of trouble in the 1600 's . 
  philip ii cut off the netherlands from the spice markets of lisbon , causing our food to taste like shit . 
  so we started sending out expedition to cut out the middle man and go straight to the source . 
  it turned out we where quite good at that sort of thing . 
  windmills used to pump our country dry where used as a power source for cutting lumber and building ships . 
  allowing the dutch to build ships in a fraction of the it took other nations . 
  and the local population of the spice producing nations preferred trading with the `` we only care about profit '' dutch corporations over the `` it would be realty swell if y' all become catholics '' mentality the portuguese had . 
  this `` friendly rivalry '' resulted in a naval war that lasted ~ 60years . 
  the english also hated the portuguese so they joined the dutch for some `` jolly cooperation '' . 
  this resulted in the portuguese loosing all but a few colonies it had in asia . 
  the campaign in the americas did n't go so well . 
  the dutch were not able push the portuguese out like they did in asia . 
  it was however able to capture parts of the caribbeans , guyana and suriname . 
  this made portuguese ships bringing home loot very susceptible to dutch pirate attacks . 
  while this may not be the only reason the portuguese empire fell , the dutch becoming a naval super power sure made maintaining colonies allot less profitable then it used to be . 
  is n't a marine territory just land that got a bit wet ? 
  a few dykes here , a couple of windmill over there . . wait a year or 2 and that soil should be perfect for tulip farming . 
  you are forgetting that a lot of people outside the pvv are also anti eu ( sp voters for example ) . 
  voting for a `` nexit '' in a referendum is a simple yes/no vote with no party affiliation , euro-skeptic cu or gl voters could also vote to leave . 
  or are you referring to wilders inability to create the referendum ( not getting enough votes in the 2de kamer ), 
   because nobody follows water board politics and it has very little impact on daily life unless you are a farmer or live in a flood risk zone . 
  but yeah , out of the 5 elections ( prov , 2dek , eu , water , gem ) i 'm most likely to skip voting for the waterboards if it 's a rainy day, 
  we do n't write down the skin colour of citizens ( or migrants ) on any official document . 
  there is little to no negative stereotype toward black people in general over here . 
  we banned domestic slavery a long time ago ( trading slaves was still consider fair game though ) so most black people that settled here where free and often accomplished businessmen . 
  most racists/bigots focus on muslims/arabs and gypsies over here . 
  i feel like the eu referendum in the uk was a spiraling mess of a political circus from day 1 . 
  there was a heap of miss information spewed out by both sides . 
  i think a lot of people voted out of nostalgia , fear and general spite towards westminster . 
  personally i think the uk underestimates the financial consequences of the uncertainty the post-article 50 2 year negotiation period will cause . 
  while simultaneously overestimating the willingness of other eu states to form trade deals that would be beneficial for the uk ( france loves hitting that veto button ) about the `` nexit '' ... 
  it could happen . 
  populism is on the rise in nl and alot of people hold grudges against the eu . 
  leaving the eu would hurt nl more than it would hurt most other eu states . 
  the netherlands is a trade-nation , loosing that trade even for a year would destroy the county . 
  we also produce a insane amount of fruit and vegetables due to our advanced high-profit/high-maintenance greenhouse sector . 
  if they stop exporting even for a single day the cost of keeping them hot would drain money at an alarming rate . 
  i do n't especially like the eu or the direction it 's heading towards , but maintaining flood defenses is n't cheap and free-trade is the only way we keep our feet dry . 
  great beer over there though . 
  belgium and sweden are also quite accepting . 
  despite the media sometimes portraying them otherwise . 
  for as far as i know , the dutch wont even put `` parents where born in ghana '' on any official documents ( defiantly not if they hold a uk passport ) . 
  skin colour/ethnicity is not a thing in our census . 
  if they fully leave the uk , they have to go to the same process of joining that states that never have been in the eu go trough to join . 
  they would need the vote of every single eu state to re-join . 
  it only takes 1 eu county to say no and allot of nations are quite salty about the whole brexit debacle , so they will probably veto it to make an example out of the uk . 
  hey there !, 
  come join the party . 
  bicycle parking is around the back and the all you can eat herring bonanza starts at 5 . 
  my guess is that the flag will stay the same . 
  it has become such a well known symbol that removing it would be a hassle for every one involved . 
  it 's just easier to leave it be . 
  to be honest , i would not even notice if they swapped the dutch flag in font of city hall with a flag of luxembourg . 
  a flag is just a symbol to recognize a country in one glance . 
  i would need to learn a new one if the uk changes it so i 'm hoping it stays the same . 
  flag do n't have the same sentimental value as in the states . 
  the eu claims it does n't add stars every time a nation joins because the stars represent the original founding nations . 
  but secretly , we are just to lazy to change ever logo , building , sing and flag . 
  if you do that we will be forced to unleash our secret weapon : [ `` the 1st army 's tactical tourism division '' ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3imjehetip8/vxklevjphqi/aaaaaaaadhy/xqmule8qnco/s640/img_2074.jpg ) just try getting your troops to the border with those things clogging the autobahn . 
  responding on the eu army point from a dutch perspective . 
  the main reason why dutch people ( and other eu state , i think ) want a eu army is maximize power while spending the least amount of cash . 
  the dutch shallow water navy is top of the bill and our air-force fighter wing is quite advanced . 
  the other parts of our defense force are good but not great . 
  our army has tanks but not allot and no way to airlift them in battle . 
  we have f-35 's but no carriers . 
  we have troops but not enough air transport . 
  we have attack helicopters but not enough recognizance drones . 
  in most recent conflicts the eu army 's already worked closely together , so why not take it to the next level ? 
  working together allows every nation to specialize in what it 's good at . 
  it does n't make sense for the dutch to train a bunch of soldiers in alpine combat when austria , finland and sweden do it allot better then us . 
  imagine if all the us states had their own air force , navy , army and marine core . 
  i bet only texas and california would be able to fork over the cash to build a carrier . 
  the eu does n't have allot of carriers for the exact same reason . 
  the eu states should stop wasting money on doing every thing half ass 'd and just join forces . 
  because the odds of germany declaring war on the netherlands are about the same as utah declaring war on kentucky . 
  and if they did decided to declare war the only way nl could win is if germany decides to drive their tanks in to the ocean and fight us there . 
  in the netherlands : 18 for pubs 18-21 for nightclubs 18 for casinos 18 for brothels 18 for coffeeshops, 
  hey we share a land border in the caribbeans on saint martin . 
  til : that the netherlands and france share 2 borders #belgium = / = real, 
  i googled azerbaijan f1 track and all i could find where ( poorly ) photoshoped concept art . 
  did they recently struck oil and are afraid that if they do n't spend it all at once it will spoil/turn sour . 
  or are they going to some kind of geopolitical midlife crisis ? 
  fearing that if they do n't host a major international event , other country will forget they exist . 
  [ a quick wiki check tells me it 's the first one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_azerbaijan#/media/file:tree_map_export_2009_azerbaijan.jpeg ) also what 's up the the 10 % unclassified ? 
  sure if you consider the ural to be the border . 
  but that 's beyond pushing it . 
  in my book that 's the same as calling london a city in the far east just because it 's on the eastern hemisphere . 
  yeah we have the same thing with where europe ends and asia stats . 
  a topic we desperately avoid whenever we see a user with a fair from azerbaijan . 
  ind4 : we hosted a eurovison song festial !!!, 
  that makes more european then portugal . 
  no i do n't care that israel hosted it in 1999 , that does n't count . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ jk , ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ azerbaijan, 
  yes !,

  the netherlands has overseas territories in the caribbean so yeah that we know/think about them every so often . 
  like during elections : i wonder how aruba will vote on this .
