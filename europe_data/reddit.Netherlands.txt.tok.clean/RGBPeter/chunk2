  ( fresh water is weird name , a lake can be filled with nasty stinky old water ), 
  being a dutch citizen and not believing in climate change/rising sea levels is kinda like a swiss citizen not believing avalanches are real . 
  there are restaurants down in the south of the country that operate kinda like `` all you can eat '' ( lopend buffet ) but the twist is that beer and wine is also included in the price . 
  you can drink all the beer you want but there is a 1 or 1,5 h time limit . 
  you can see how this quickly devolves to an alcoholic time-trail . 
  i would not bring someone there for a romantic date . 
  it 's a barbaric place to find your self sober at . 
  i 'm not talking about legality , it 's still illegal in nl . 
  but buying a joint in the netherlands is about as easy as ordering a latte at starbucks . 
  what i 'm talking about is quality . 
  i 'm not saying the stuff you get in the states is always worse then over here . 
  what i mean is we have a longer history of shops/growers developing and experimenting with taste , texture and potency . 
  i live in a small city ( 80k pop ) and i can chose between 12 different coffee shops , all of them competing to be the best in town . 
  i have never seen a bud that was crushed because over here there is n't a guy vacuum sealing a 50kg bag of weed to a small size so he can fit it into the fuel tank of his car . 
  growers over here have the freedom to experiment with fancy techniques and complex additives because they always had a sure fire low risk way of selling their products ( if a growing wants to know how much product a shop is able to move he can just look into the books . 
  the front door of the shop is a legal tax paying business after all . 
  next time you are in amsterdam i recommend trying out the weed in a shop outside the tourist area ( one the local use ) and you wo n't be disappointed . 
  having a `` medical '' weed dispensary in town is one thing . 
  having 10 shops that have been competing with one and other for over 30 years is an other thing . 
  dutch weed might be top notch but i would trade it all for the us system of `` free refills '', 
  the lines do line up perfectly . 
  ah if you like the super dutch stuff i would also recommend : ** volendam ** is a historic fishing village . 
  it 's the best place to spot traditional dutch clothing .

  the city has a historic cheese market that is definitely worth visiting .

  we like orange because of a town in france named orange . 
  that 's where our royal family is originally from . 
  the fruit is called sinaasappel over here . 
  ( sinaas comes from sina , an old name for china ) it just does n't make sense . 
  i associate oranges with spain ( they grow a lot of them ) . 
  i saw this pic in a news paper without reading the headline and all i thought was ; is turkey mad at spain or something ? 
   which is not a new thing is it , we 've always been allies with the wahhabists [ ah of course ... the ideology that brought us this great organisation . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mblrasr.png ) , i hear they do a lot of charity work in the region . 
  [ no but serious , i would not recommend typing stuff like that on a us website if you ever plan on flying there . 
  i understand you are talking about the uk being on good terms with the saudi king . 
  [ but this is exactly how you get put on a `` no-fly '' list . 
  this is how julius cesar would say ; '' * grow up and take a good hard look at yourself !, 
  [ it 's probably those oranges they stabbed that are producing the rotting smell ] ( http://turkishminute.turkishminute.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/reis4.jpg ), 
  [ of course it 's oc ] ( https://i.imgur.com/r8vbcbz.png ) . 
  i 'm no meme stealing normie . 
  i spend more money on waterschapsbelastingen ( not drowning tax ) than i do on heath insurance . 
  we already have done the research to calculate the absolute worst case scenario ( a 4m rise by 2200 ) and we also have a funding plan ready to increase our coastal defenses to withstand a 6,5 m rise in sea level by 2200 . 
  [ full report ] ( http://www.deltacommissie.com/doc/deltareport_full.pdf ) , [ summery ] ( http://www.deltacommissie.com/doc/deltareport_summary.pdf ) . 
  we have been doing this shit since the 13th century , we kinda got the hang of it . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if the flood of noah happened in the modern age , noah would not even bother building the ark . 
  he would just bring all the animal to the amsterdam zoo and go sight seeing for a couple of weeks . 
  i 'm swimming in the stuff after i posted [ this pepe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/memeeconomy/comments/5njou8/how_to_tell_is_your_pepe_is_genuine_or_counterfeit/ ) and it hit the front of r/all . 
  you look like you could use some post karma to balance out your comment karma . 
   if i 'd got a chance to visit a couple more cities around , what would you recommended ? 
  ** rotterdam ** ( 42 min via train ) is what amsterdam would look like if it got bombed during ww2 and we had to rebuild it . 
  it 's less touristy than amsterdam and has amazing modern architecture . 
  it looks like amsterdam but the streets are wider and it 's less crowded .

  it 's not far and the scenery along the way is nice ) is the place to go if you want to see traditional dutch stuff like windmills and wooden shoes . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.the-innsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/zaanse-schans-zaandam.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.zaanseschansbikerent.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/zs.jpg ) not a city but ... ** the delta works ** ( recommend viewing it by car , the area is quite large . 
  nice activity for when it 's raining ) is considered one of the 7 modern world wonders . 
  it 's a complex system of structures build after the north sea [ whooped our ass and flooded the crap out of the south of our country ] ( https://hoekschewaard.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/6a00e3989ea39800050110163b9376860c.jpg ) back in 1953 . 
  after the flood we pumped a massive amount of resources into modernizing our coastal defenses . 
  the delta works really give you a good impression of the amount of work and dedication it takes to build your country below sea level . 
   reciprocality had to look that word up in a dictionary . 
  but i agree that is likely the case . 
  the dutch government brings up russia 's treatment of homosexuals whenever it gets the chance . 
  there are only 2 types of people according to erdogan , people who will vote yes in the referendum and people who are gulenists . 
  that guy is more black & white then a charlie chaplin movie . 
  i 'm very interested in the polytechnical museum . 
   also the underground is absolutely stunning . 
  [ stunning ] ( http://www.irishmanabroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/moscow-metro-komsomolskaya.jpg ) is a massive understatement . 
  if you airbrushed out the train and told me it was the ball room where catherine the great met peter iii , i would have believed you . 
  yeah but even the older generation does not strike me as the type of people who would , after seeing a gay couple in amsterdam , take matters into their own hands and beat the gay out them . 
  at most they would just mumble a few insults and carry on walking . 
  i do n't exactly know why but , to me the ukrainian people come across as the sort of people who would realise that they are visiting a country that has slightly different social conventions then their home country . 
   i have some plans to visit amsterdam this year i 'm glad to welcome you into our capital . 
  and if i might give a tip , than that would be to skip the ann frank house . 
  the line is way to long for what it has to offer . 
  there is almost no dutch art from that era on display inside the netherlands . 
  most of it is in belgium , germany england or spain . 
  the national gallery of art in washington dc also has a substantial collection of early netherlandish art, 
  yeah it 's kinda like calling your grill house ; dave 's `` we totally conform to health & safety standards '' grill house and bbq, 
  nice thanks for taking the time to look that up !, 
   zee correct !, 
   live on a camping site it does need to be a official camping site . 
  pitching your tent on the beach or in the middle of the wood is a sure fire way to get a ticket . 
   in amsterdam [ ... ] at the sea . 
  amsterdam used to close to the sea , the zuiderzee . 
  in 1930 's we realised swimming in salt water sucks because it kinda stings when you get it in your eyes . 
  so we closed that sucker off with a dyke and turned it into the largest artificial lake of europe . 
  we then proceeded to build the worlds largest artificial island in that lake . 
  there was a plan to drain an other section of the lake but mother nature called our mp and begged us to stop . 
  ( rumor has it that she is currently melting the icecaps in a attempt to raise sea-levels . 
  yeah , like that is going to slow us down !, 
  bring it , mother nature is n't the boss of us ), 
   and these turks ca n't be all that many while they are not all in turkey at the moment , ~ 400 000 people in the netherlands have a dutch and a turkish passport . 
  that 's about 2,3 % of the dutch population . 
  https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=erdogan%20meme / r/memeconomy should be investing in this one . 
  fortunately the international court of justice is also in the netherlands . 
  he can share the plane with the dutch-turks going back home , good way to reduce the carbon footprint . 
  yup . 
  and the republic of the congo is also a way nicer place to live then the democratic republic of the congo, 
  not in amsterdam .
