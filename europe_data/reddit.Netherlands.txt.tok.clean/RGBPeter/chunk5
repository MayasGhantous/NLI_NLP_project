  dude no need to be salty . 
  i 'm fully aware lots of people all over the ussr starved under stalin , but op asked what i knew about ukraine . 
  i know it has the largest solar power station in the world . 
  ( ow wait shit was n't that thing located in crimea ? 
  guess russia has it now ) i know ukraine is home to the antonov state company , the company responsible for creating the largest plane in the world . 
  i know stalin staved the ever-loving shit out of them back in the 30 's in a famine know as the holodomor i know euromaidan was the main source of oc for / r/riotporn back in 2013, 
  you can make fun of him all you want but he will whoop your ass in a game of s.k.a.t.e, 
  does any one have the number of guy operating the crane ? 
  i 've looked everywhere for my 7th back-up bike but i just could not find it . 
  pretty sure that it 's the one on the bottom right . 
  the dutch went all voc and started carving out massive swats of land in the name of king willem . 
  our alliance is everlasting, 
  agreed , but i feel a slight hint of shame knowing that when you give the dutch an empty canvas and 15 colours they immediately revert to their voc state of mind . 
  planting flags and spreading the all consuming orange torrent . 
  do n't know if it 's a good or a bad thing , but the number over finland is lower then the number over the netherlands . 
  so i consider it a win . 
  nice to see all those eu states collaborating and making compromises in order to create something beautiful ... 
  but when you scroll to the north thing are a little different ... sweden , norway and the netherlands ruthlessly expanding their borders , consuming smaller communities . 
  covering the entire northern in ever-growing swats of blue , red and orange . 
  they realize other people outside nld use that service to book accommodations in turkey as well right ? 
  great way to kill your tourism sector . 
  trowing water in the face of the dutch is pointless . 
  the dutch would have build an intricate system of dikes , polders , canals and pumps around their face before the first drop even hits them . 
  the dutch just hold their passport sideways and the turks will think it 's a french passport . 
  i do n't think you can find them on booking.com . 
  it 's a dutch company . 
  i 'm from the netherlands and i 'm pretty sure the city i live in was at the bottom of the north sea 1300 years ago . 
  true the dutch gov advises to be careful when traveling to turkey and to avoid crowded areas/mobs . 
  nah man , your government is a disgrace . 
  plenty of good turks still there . 
  the entire travel advice for turkey can be found in dutch over [ here ] ( https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/reisadviezen/inhoud/turkije ), 
  holland is n't even a nations so it 's not even nationalism , it 's provinceism . 
  do n't be a grammar nazi . 
  you are playing into erdogan 's `` the netherlands = fascism '' narrative . 
  please buy a map, 
   a secular christian i did not think of that . 
  people born in the 60 's were regularly baptized at birth . 
  so that makes then technically christian even if they have n't been in a church in the last 30 years and believe jesus is a fairy tale . 
  the eurobar poll had 4 categories . 
  the 2010 eurobarometer poll asked whether the person believes `` there is a god '' , believes `` there is some sort of spirit or life force '' or `` does n't believe there is any sort of spirit , god or life force '' and `` decline to answer . '' . 
  for nl those categories were 28 % , 39 % , 30 % and 3 % . 
  if you add those up it 's 100 % . 
  if 44 % of the pop is christian then how can only 28 % believe there is a god ? 
  i thought believing in a god was a must for becoming a christian . 
  no it 's a eurobar pol from 2010 so it 's 28 % of the total pop including christians . 
  [ source on page 207 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf ) and 44 % christian + 28 % `` i believe in god '' means there are only 28 % left for secular people to fill in . 
  but according to study done by dutch universities in 2015 67.8 % of the people here [ have no affiliation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_the_netherlands ) . 
  win/gia says 66 % is irreligious . 
  zuckerman polled 39-44 % of the dutch pop as identifying as agnostic or atheist . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_irreligion ), 
  weird how the source claims the netherlands has 44 % christians but also claims only 28 % answered yes to `` i believe there is a god '' also ... sweden 65 % christian !? 
  yeah that seems about right / s, 
  til that ukrainians have a positive view of most countries . 
  i know for a fact that the north american cougar , iberian lynx and the snow leopard lack the resources , infrastructure and technical know-how needed to produce weapon-grade plutonium . 
  but if a warhead happens to fall into their paws i would not be surprised if they used it to further their plan of world domination . 
  yeah no way in hell we are doing the other 14 couplets . 
  fun fact : the governmental bodies in charge of flood control and land reclamation are actually called water boards i kid you not . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_board_ ( netherlands ) not so fun fact : eating tulip bulbs was the most effective method of not starving to death back in wwii when nazi germany decided to starve the ever loving shit out of us . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_famine_of_1944%e2%80%9345#food  got ta learn more dutch . 
  if you mean the language ... then that should not be a big priory . 
  the netherlands is # 1 when it comes to english proficiency in not english speaking countries . 
  about 93 % of dutch people speak it . 
  that 's only 3 % less then the percentage of english speakers in nz and 13 % higher then the percentage of english speakers in the us . 
  if you really want be insta-dutch you need to work on improving your biking skills . 
  here is how . 
  toss out your helmet . 
  only german tourists wear helmets over here . 
  get a bike [ like this one ] ( https://www.omafiets.nl/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/o/m/omafietsnl-omafiets-basic-zwart-voordrager-art-slot-2.jpg ) that lacks hand brakes and only has a single gear . 
  the rack on the front is where you store your groceries and the rack on the back is were you [ store children ] ( https://carlycarsonauthormyblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bicycle-2-kids.jpg ) 3 . 
  now comes the tricky part . . 
  learn how to ride that bike while carrying an other bike ( this is actually a valuble skill to have here . 
  usefull for when you pick some one up from the train and do n't feel like carrying a grown man on your back seat . ), 
  the technique is sometimes called `` ghostriding a bike '' . 
  [ here is a step by step tutorial ] ( http://www.instructables.com/id/how-to-ghostride-a-bike/ ) . 
  get used to the fact that dutch people view traffic rules more as a suggestion then an actual law . 
  safety is n't an concern because you wo n't be sharing the road with cars all that often and when you do the guy driving the car is scared of you and not the other way around . 
  ( we have laws that basically say ; if you hit someone with your car it 's always your fault even is the bike rider was on the wrong side of the road crossing a red light while reading the news paper . 
  yeah some people read the morning paper while on a bike . ), 
  [ here is a video of rush hour in amsterdam to give you an impression of how it all goes down here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8h_daltjv0 ) i 'm pretty sure that when you apply for citizenship and the person across the table starts asking questions like ; `` do you speak dutch ? '', 
  `` do you have a steady job in the netherlands ? '', 
  etc etc. 
  you can just answer with ; `` no , but who cares about that anyway . 
  watch me ride this bike instead ! . 
  after demonstrating your dutch bike riding prowess he will hand you your dutch passport and ask if he can lend your second bike so you can celebrate at the the nearest stroopwafel stand . 
   playing dance music . 
  yeah our king is also into dance music . 
  [ here you can see him dropping the bass ] ( http://static1.hln.be/static/photo/2015/10/13/7/20150603072017/media_xll_7763182.jpg ) during the * school of house * dance festival in chicago . 
  [ here you can see the king and queen hanging out on stage with armin van buuren ] ( http://0.static.upcoming.nl/static/images/da1e69851e_1397636900_en-armin-van-buuren__list-noup.jpg ) and [ here he is looking all royal and king like ] ( http://www.hangthebankers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dutch-king-willem-alexander.jpg ), 
  wanting to eat greasy meat while you are shit faced does not really qualify as food fetish . 
  and what i trying to imply was that not * all * turkish people living in the netherlands need to go . 
  i do n't think we should let every isis fighter in to the country . 
  and i certainly was n't implying that grilled meat is a good argument for debating opening up your borders . 
  most of the turks running kabab joints over here are born in the netherlands , have a dutch passport and speak fluent dutch . 
  they have been here since the sixties . 
  they did not ask for asylum , we invited them over because we had a labor shortage and turkey had an unemployment problem . 
  they are as much a part of the dutch society as the indos , arubans , surinamese or frisians are . 
  while there is a small percentage of turks living here who refuse to integrate into dutch society , there is no need to kick them all out because a few of them misbehave . 
  i 'm not really pro migration but do n't see the harm in multi cultural societies . 
  the guy selling me kebap is considers himself a dutch-turk just like how i consider myself a dutch-frisian . 
  i love celebrating kings day and dress in orange and sing the national anthem when the national team is playing .
