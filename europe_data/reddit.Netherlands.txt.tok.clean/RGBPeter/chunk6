  nice journalism reuters . . 
  treating the initial exploratory research done in 2015 that looked at human exposure data from multiple sources published after 2001 that concluded '' limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans '' and in-vitro data and animal tests from way back in 1985 that concluded `` sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experiment animals '' and some the iarc turned those findings into a `` probably carcinogenic to humans '' conclusion as hard science . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/iarcnews/pdf/monographvolume112.pdf ) and treating the review done by the joint who/fao panel a year later as cooperate shilling . 
  ignoring that the 2016 report has way more hard facts and experimental data . 
  the report concluded that :  the overall weight of evidence indicates that administration of glyphosate and its formulation products at doses as high as 2000 mg/kg body weight by the oral route , the route most relevant to human dietary exposure , was not associated with genotoxic effects in an overwhelming majority of studies conducted in mammals , a model considered to be appropriate for assessing genotoxic risks to humans . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.who.int/foodsafety/jmprsummary2016.pdf?ua=1 ) to put that into perspective . 
  if you weigh 75 kg you can eat 150g of pure glyphosate without it causing a noticeable risk of getting cancer . 
  you have about 50 % chance of kicking the bucket within the hour if you consume 48g of ibuprofen . 
  and you same chance of dying if you consume 225g of table salt . 
  i checked the label of the weed killer spray in the lead picture [ not the exact bottle but a bottle by the same company with the formula name ] of the article . 
  93.7 % of that stuff is inert ingredients . 
  so even asuming the rest of the stuff is all glyphosate you will need to chug down at least a couple of six pack worth of weed killer before you get cancer . 
  my final conclusion is that glyphosate can cause cancer . 
  but you need to be a herbicide drinking mad man to feel the effects . 
  yeah i ca n't quite understand what is wrong with this . 
  it sounds like t-mobile is launching a streaming service with no data cost . 
  i do n't see how this will * `` cause discrimination '' * and how this * `` poses a threat to users '' * if t-mobile thinks it will be able to run this service and still make a profit then it 's just healthy competition . 
  i pretty sure other telecom providers are allowed to do the same thing . 
  or is it because they think this is unfair to spotify because spotify does n't have it 's own telecom infrastructure ? 
  nothing is stopping spotify from building it 's own 4g antennas .

  could the whole turkey-netherlands diplomatic incident be a false flag operation orchestrated by a shadowy cabal of chinese take-away restaurant and loempia-truck owners ... ^ ^ * slowly ^ ^ reaches ^ ^ for ^ ^ the ^ ^ tin-foil ^ ^ and ^ ^ starts ^ ^ folding ^ ^ a ^ ^ hat * i mean ... 
  the motive is certainly there . 
  chinese restaurants have trouble staying relevant with the ever increasing volume of sushi-bars and the labor intensive process of folding a loempia just ca n't compete with the cylindrical rotary meat-based efficency of the d\u00f6ner . 
  i 'm gon na dive into the wikileaks archives to see if i can find a connection between erdo\u011fan and the loempia cabal . 
  i have set up a dead-man switch that i need to reset every 36h . 
  if the loempia cabal tracks me down and i fail to reset the clock they protocols will active .

  i will not stand idly by while a secret cabal controls the fast food industry from the shadows . 
  you might think ; `` so what , i do n't even like d\u00f6ner '' but this is a slippery slope . 
  i do n't think they will stop after taking away out d\u00f6ner . 
  who is to say they wo n't go after the febo or the hema worst next ... 
  great way to relieve stress and a citrus twist to my d\u00f6ner might just turn out to be a gastronomical stroke of genius . 
  yeah i just kinda stopped listening to his statements a while back . 
  it clear to me that that guy is not a very refined politician and that becoming a better politician is n't very high on his to-do-list . 
  he comes across as a guy who simply likes being in charge of stuff . 
  i have trust in the us trias politica and that huge majority of other politicians ( actual politicians who understand how the system works ) will keep the country running until the next guy/girl is elected . 
  there are plenty of people in the us gov who will take the time to advice trump and explain geo-politics to him . 
  he might be in command of the most powerful military in the world . 
  but when he orders a drone strike on swedish royal family vacation cabin because the swedish minister of education gave one of his hotels a 1-star review on yelp , i 'm sure that some one in the chain of command will ensure that the uav looses connection and crashes into the ocean . 
  and i think people like merkel do n't take his twitter rants serious and just think `` there 's that troll shitposting again '' if he gets angry at germany and tweets he is going deport all german people from the us , she is just gon na text rex tillerson and ask ; `` yo !, 
  rex , is he seriously gon na kick all those people out of the us ? '', 
  and response will be something along the lines of ; `` wait what ? 
  i did not hear anything about that . 
  is he shitposting on twitter again ? 
  if that is the case just ignore it . 
  if no one brings it up he will forget about it in a couple of days '' 4 years of trump might hurt the us geo-political image a bit but the relation the us has build up over the years more then able to survive 4 years of trump . 
  you guys nuked japan twice but shinzo abe of japan is still willing to pay golf with the potus . 
  and my county has been a close ally of yours ever since you guys decided to chuck a bunch of tea into the boston harbor . 
  i view the trump administration as the us `` just going trough a phase '' . 
  it will pass . 
  no no we need to keep at least a couple of them . 
  say what you want about them , but those orange stabbing goofballs sure know how to cook me up a nice d\u00f6ner when i walk out of a club at 03:00 . 
   oh buddy sea level are we above !, 
  hell yea we are . 
  you can expect our dredging fleet to arrive in wellington in a month or 2 .

  yeah and while matthew c. perry was in trade `` negotiations '' you can bet your ass the dutch trading vessels docked alongside the us navy ships trying to sell stuff to the us sailors .

   there 's no reason to whine your definition of `` whining '' is quite broad . 
   it does n't i 'm only [ quoting what is in the fact_sheet . pdf ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dt2cmbs.png )  very , very different claim than what you said . 
  explain to me how `` power consumption per km '' is a very , very different metric then `` fuel efficiency '' . 
  and action radius if this thing is 300 km . 
  [ the action radius of a nissan leaf is 222 km under ideal conditions . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electric_car#range )  they did . 
  see : mars exploration rover . 
  yeah but those only store the power required to run that tiny ass rover . 
  ( i cant find the exact number but guesstimating using the duration of a martian sol , the power needed to run the rover , and the power generated . 
  i would say ~ 300 wh ) so this magical battery will have to have atleast the same capacity as the battery in the nissan leaf ( likely lager because flying in the air for 300 km takes more power then driving on a road for 222 km ) . 
  the battery in the leaf is ~ 24 kwh and weighs 300 kg . 
  ( i was going somewhere with this but i kinda lost my train of thought . 
  sorry )  darpa earlier this year built and flew it 's own vtol x-plane from what i understand the ( we are talking about the `` lightningstrike '' right ? ), 
  [ never took flight ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/darpa-lightningstrike-plane-aircraft-vertical-take-off-landing-vtol-aurora-flight-sciences-a6917076.html ) ( wait i just found out a 20 % scale model did do a short hover test [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgwsuzbgh0s ) . 
  that plane is also unmanned and will just crash if it experiences multiple engine failure . 
  the creators of the magic plane claim . 
   to fulfill our safety objectives , we chose the concept of ultra-redundancy . 
  we equip the lilium jet with small ** independent components ** , so that , for example , a single engine failure does not have consequences for the aircraft 's safety or stability .
