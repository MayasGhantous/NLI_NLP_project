  the system can still do a ** vertical ** landing with a ** loss of up multiple engines ** . 
  and  the duct around the fan is designed to ** contain the loss of a fan blade at full power ** . 
  if an engine fails , for example due to ingestion of a foreign object , it is guaranteed that this event does not cause the adjacent engine to fail as well . 
  the only way to prevent a cascade effect , in case of a blade loss event , is using ** shielded engines ** . 
  i 'm no engineer but those sound like heavy systems . 
  something else that bothers me about this vtol plane is that in 2 years time 4 guys in their early thirties were able to build a working 2 seater prototype using technology they developed in-house with a budget in the 10-20m usd range . 
  the combined power of darpa , lockheed , sikorsky , aurora flight sciences , boeing , karem aircraft and rolls-royce libertyworks , 142m usd of military funding and being able to use classified military tech was not enough to produce a prototype that has the the same scale and flight capabilities as the lilium jet has . 
  also , why is it impossible to find any info on the batteries and the engines they are going to use ? 
  the vtol x-plane is a military project but the wiki clearly states the xv-24a will use a rolls-royce ae1107c turboshaft engine and 3 honeywell generators to produce 3mw of juice . 
  i think they are being quite about the engine/battery model/performance because if they do people will be able to do a back-of-the-napkin calculation that tells them a li-ion array powering 36 deducted e-fan to fly a vtol plane carrying 5 passengers for 300 km at a speed of 300km/h will never work without graphene battery tech . 
  nah man , the military is quite good at spotting a hoax, 
  yeah i 'm not buying it . 
  downloaded the press kit and took a look at the maiden flight pictures , those look shopped af . 
  and lets be honest . 
  this thing is supposed to carry 5 people + avionics + battery + parachute and still fly 300 km/h @ a range of 300 km . 
  and it only has a 10m wing span ? 
  5 people ( + baggage ) would be 5x 80 kg at least so that 's a payload of 400 kg . 
  the mq-1b is powered with a 4 cylinder internal combustion engine ( way higher t/w ratio then electric ) and has a 14.8 m wingspan . 
  it only has a max payload of ~ 500 kg ( including fuel ) . 
  not only is it able to fly , it 's able to vtol . 
  al while maintaining a fuel efficiency/action radius similar to top of the bill electric cars . 
  and that magical battery would also have enough safety features to pass flight safety regulations . 
  if this is the case ... why the hell is nasa strapping rtg 's onto mars rovers ? 
  just buy the battery these guys are using and that thing would be cruising all over mars with power to spare . 
  and it 's not that they are using a single high efficiency engine . 
  nope , they are using 36 small ones . 
  each with it 's own housing , wiring and control system adding weight . 
  they claim '' we use the world 's lightest known material -- and still we continue to strip off the last kilogram . '', 
  carbon fiber gives about a 30 % reduction in mass over aircraft aluminium . 
  but they then proceed to squander that weight saving by including a huge ass panoramic canopy . 
  last time i checked acrylic is not really an ultra light material . 
  [ the voc c. 1641 ... ] ( http://m.memegen.com/u8o7g1.jpg ), 
  sure they might be religiously conservative , but i do n't think that matters . 
  sure it would take alot of time to modernize their views on human rights but it 's not impossible . 
  the vatican is relaxing it 's view points and while gay marriage might not be a thing there , some muslim majority countries have laws in place to protect the lgbt communities . 
  for example : turkey , albania , northern cyprus and lebanon . 
  now the uk can finaly have a stadium packed full of straw men . 
  the eu would ban something like that because straw men are a fire-hazard . 
  nah mate , we 're good . 
  [ we just patched up old zealand and it cost a crap load of money to get it back in working order . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delta_works ) . 
  or is new zealand above sea level and not a literal flood magnet ? 
  if that 's the case ... 
  welcome to the netherlands . 
  belgium can have the old one . 
  [ your nation fits nicely in the north sea ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6znyde6.png ) , we should be able to move it there if you give us a couple of decades . 
  we might not be able to do anything that will produce concrete results , but that does n't mean we should stop showing our disagreement with the situation . 
  russia is just to strong for any eu nation to force it to do something . 
  we could could put trade sanctions on russia , but we rely on russian gas . 
  we could vote in the un , but russia has veto power . 
   what do you propose next ? 
  i think the only possible way to force russia to change it 's mind is to fist change the mind of every other trade partner it has ( not like that is going to be easy ) . 
  and form a collective that puts export sanctions russia . 
  if the eu says ; `` we will only buy your gas if you stop beating up gays '' russia will just turn to china or the us . 
  if we all say the same thing russia will have no other options . 
  because i 'm pretty sure russia hates economic regression more than it hates people who do funky stuff in the bed room . 
  just because chechnyans do n't give a shit a europe does n't mean europe does n't give a shit about gay chechnyans being put into camps by their countrymen . 
  being put in camp because of your sexual preferences is n't a national problem that stops at borders . 
  it 's a basic human rights problem . 
  i do n't care how their passport looks or to who they pay taxes . 
  stuff like this is n't russia 's problem , it 's humanity 's problem . 
  i though calling other eu nations nazi filled fascist banana republics was a sign of turkey-eu membership talks nearing completion , guess i was wrong . 
  the burka ban is n't banning the burka . 
  it 's banning stuff that covers your face in pubic areas without having a occupational/safety reason to do so . 
  it also bans balaclavas and full face helmets . 
  are you building the 100 acres of land from scratch or is it existing land ? 
   bloody penguin-buggering no 10/10, 
   we shall not be moved !, 
  until the person standing in the front of the queue has concluded his/her business . 
  then you all move in an orderly fashion , because proper queue etiquette is what the uk is know for .

  nah , that 's how it 's supposed to be . 
  * the speed limit on a highway is km/h 130 * gravity on earth is m/s ^ 2 9.8 * the ideal gas constant is j \u22c5 k ^ -1 \u22c5 mol ^ -1 8.314, 
  it 's not about being stupid , it 's about education . 
  you can be hella smart but if you never learned about how hitler rose to power you wo n't be able to see the similarity between that and what erdogan is doing . 
  [ i 'm not comparing him to hitler in the sense that erdogan is a nazi . 
  i 'm just drawing parallels between the `` enabling act of 1933 '' and the `` 2017 turkish constitutional referendum '' ], 
  nice catch . 
  the word `` leftist '' hurts my soul . 
  you ca n't just slap '' - ist '' after a word and claim it 's a legitimate word fit for use by journalists . 
   i know we do n't all believe in climate change of course i believe in climate change . 
  it 's kinda hard to ignore stuff like rising sea levels when your house is 7m bellow sea level and still walking distance from the beach . 
   which might just mess up things all over the world if you close the gibraltar strait . 
  we have excellent research laboratory and hundreds of years worth of experience messing with mother nature . 
  we turned a sea into a fresh water lake using 1920 's technology . 
  using current tech we would probably be able to figure out a plan that does n't mess up global currents . 
   also valuable ecosystems would be lost forever . 
  true but it would also create opportunity for new ecosystems to from . 
  take the [ oostvaardersplassen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oostvaardersplassen ) for example . 
  it used to be a boring stretch of water with little bio diversity to speak of . 
  now it 's an nature reserve build on a island we created in the 60 's , it 's home to endangered bird species and one of the only places in the netherlands were large herbivores can roam freely . 
   if we pump the mediterranean dry , then the scary muslims can just walk to europe . 
  muslims are n't scary . 
  there are muslims in the balkans , they can already walk over . 
  how does he know the road is even there ? 
  thank for clearing that up for me . 
  it 's this an actual photo or did the author create a composite of two photos ? 
  so you guys are n't going to complain when we make a giant polder out of the mediterranean ? 
  cool !, 
  brb , i 'm grabbing my shovel . 
  i 'm pretty sure at least half of the people in this picture have a tumbler blog .
