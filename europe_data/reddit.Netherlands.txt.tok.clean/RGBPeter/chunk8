  [ harry potter ] ( http://www.futilitycloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/2006-03-04-separated-at-birth.jpg ) would be proud . 
  yeah properly disposing of nuclear waste has more to do with basic human decency then it does with being part of a trade union . 
  senpai is japanese for `` teacher/mentor '' [ here ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-hope-senpai-will-notice-me ) is the knowyourmeme page on the `` i hope senpai will notice me '' meme . 
  he can always rent a few cells from the netherlands . 
  [ we have room to spare . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37904263 ), 
  i feel like this news paper is shouting at me . 
  they did stop . 
  nazi germany is n't a thing anymore . 
   we 're still your friends . 
  indeed you are . 
  saving our asses in wwii is not something one forgets easily . 
   in the sea . 
  uhh yeah ... about that ... [ that sea is now a fresh water lake . 
  if you grow up in a tiny village most `` basisscholen '' are 100 % frisian except for dutch classes . 
  after an intense search on google maps this building appears to be non existent . 
  [ it 's just a convincing artist render . 
  ] ( https://www.e-architect.co.uk/rotterdam/rive-gauche ) it 's supposed to be in the spangen neighborhood , close to the van nelle factory and the sparta station . 
  ( i got my pictures from searching `` rotterdam architecture '' on google images . 
  this one was on page 1 , i did not do any fact checking ), 
   you are only trying to drag the discussion away from topic with your own logical fallacy and lack of common sense . 
  no i 'm am merely implying that your statement was oversimplifying turkey-europe relations . 
  there are lot 's of things europe and turkey agree/cooperate on . 
  things like ; nato , cern , osce , etc, 
  it might be the shape of the buildings reflecting the sound waves ... 
  it 's the logic of your statement . 
  you basically said :  if europeans are against [ x ] , then [ x ] is good for turks . 
  i just filled [ x ] in with the most extreme example i could think off . 
  * europeans are also against isis , does that mean isis is good for turkey ? 
  * europeans are also against global warming , does that mean global warming is good for turkey ? 
  * europeans are also against nuclear disasters , does that mean nuclear disasters are good for turkey ? 
  hey is n't that building in cardiff bay ? 
  i remember it from watching the doctor who spin-off * torchwood * . 
  looks alot more stable than op 's pic . 
  yeah but it 's a pain finding furniture that will fit with all those slanted walls . 
  black magic most likely . 
  building offset buildings is a piece of cake for a city that also has [ surge barrier ] ( https://beeldbank.rws.nl/photos/2918/437783.jpg ) that makes the thames barrier look like something [ kids play with in the tub ] ( http://www-starflood-eu-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/maeslantkering.jpg ) , the city just finished creating [ a huge artificial harbor extension ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/maasvlakte+rotterdam/@51.9393562,3.95076,11.89z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c5ab5157b8a7d3:0x15ceb7ebdc9d7515!8m2!3d51.9632789!4d4.031126 ) . 
  i would really recommend vising sometime if you are into engineering and architecture . 
  europeans are also against the bubonic plague . 
  does that mean the bubonic plague is also good for turks ? 
  that city is filled with strange buildings .

  nuclear power is the way to go . 
  makes sense . 
  why would you build a second story when you have the entire outback to expand into . 
  you call that modern ? 
  it 's just a upside-down house . 
  the borg knows it , the dutch know it and the germans ought to know it as well ... [ a cube is the most efficient house shape . 
  it looks like a typical australian expat house . 
  dam . . that page has some fancy scrolling action going on . 
  the clickbait in this title is next level . 
  true , but i fail to see how 2009 iranian elections , obama and nuclear weapons factor into this discussion . 
  who is talking about the usa ? 
  how is rwanda saver than luxembourg ? 
  i 'm not sure you can call it an umlaut . 
  it just has 2 dot 's in it 's most basic form . 
  if you an ` ' ` on the letter it looks [ like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/bijna.png ) . 
  i 'm guessing that if you slap an umlaut on it it would have a double dot on both the i and the j, 
  i do n't know the official status of y in the dutch alphabet . 
  the alphabet i learned in school looked [ like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/28/dutch_handwriting_sample.png ) with the ij replacing the y. 
  the y is almost exclusively used for foreign loan words in dutch . 
  thanks . 
  [ found the full report ( for 2015 ) of the rte in english for those wanting to read it . ], 
  ( https://english.euthanasiecommissie.nl/binaries/euthanasiecommissie-en/documents/publications/annual-reports/2002/annual-reports/annual-reports/jaarverslag2015eng.pdf ), 
  it 's * from/of * ( i do n't know what `` gogh '' is , but . . ) rembrandt van rijn would be rembrandt of [ rhine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhine ) . 
  an other common word found dutch names that does n't need to be capitalized is `` de '' . 
  it means `` the '' . 
  so dave de vries would be dave the frisian and mary de jager would be mary the hunter . 
  while we are on the topic of capitalization , an other weird quirk of the dutch language is the letter '' \u0133 '' . 
  it 's considered a single letter so both the `` i '' and the `` j '' are capitalized when a name starts with it . 
  for example ; ijsselmeer . 
  ( lake ijssel ) . 
  in dutch phone-books names starting with this letter are found between x and z. dutch alphabetical listing goes ; w , x , ij/y , z, 
  a source of the statistics this blog uses would be nice . 
  could people stop capitalizing `` van '' in dutch names . 
  it 's vincent van gogh not vincent van gogh . 
  yeah and the netherlands deserves not being called a fascist state filled with nazis . 
   the cross-party pacac said it had no direct evidence foreign governments were to blame , rather than simply a surge in demand , but noted that the crash had indications of being a distributed denial of service attack . 
  i fail to see how this points to russia . 
  you do n't need to be russian to download a copy of loic . 
  it 's basically what the dutch empire was build on . 
  the wic bought slaves in africa and sold them to the americas and the voc covered the spice trade in asia . 
  the pentagram , a symbol sometimes used in devil worshiping rituals , is meant to depict the anus of the devil . 
  the devil 's anus holds vast amounts of demonic power . 
  you da real mvp . 
  ( i can read german but still . . nice work ), 
  on the flip side ... 
  it will be way easier to get a job as a customs check officer . 
  would be the tallest building in europe ( if we exclude russia from the list . 
  buildings be tall in moscow , it has like 5 300m + buildings ), 
  pretty decent quality for a document that old . 
  * shovel * drainage pump * tulip seeds build some dikes , pump out all the water , create a polder that turns that island into a peninsula and plant some tulips ... because who does n't like tulips ? 
  it 's gon na be [ urk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urk ) all over again . 
   all are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law . 
  all are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination . 
  how does this apply to voter id , wiretaps and cctv ? 
  edit : i thought you were talking about article 7 of the declaration of human rights . 
  i guess you are talking about article 7 of the treaty on european union . 
  you should watch your tongue , or what is now benelux , will become bene .
