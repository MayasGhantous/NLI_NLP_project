  a movie that won 5 academy awards and 2 golden globes is totally unknown in austria ? 
  it 's considered one of the classics in film . 
  for a country that only has a population of 8.7 million , bringing in 25.3 million tourists in 2014 is nothing to snuff at . 
  nl only attracted 13.9 million tourists in that year . 
  people must like mountains more then they like windmills . 
  you have a valid point . 
  belgium went without an elected government for 589 days back during [ 2010-2011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%e2%80%9311_belgian_government_formation ) . 
  durring that period the european parliament in brussels continued business as usual . 
  what if the netherlands holds an election and elects a guy that decides to close the port of rotterdam , amsterdam and block cargo ships from entering the westerschelde ( a inland waterway in the netherlands ship use in order to reach the port of antwerp ) . 
  714\u00a0589\u00a0000 tons/year of cargo passes trough those ports , or about the same as all the ports in germany , france and the uk combined . 
  we had elections a while back . 
  a anti-eu party almost became the biggest party . 
  the netherlands might not have the labor force of france or the economic power of germany , but if the netherlands decides to leave the eu ( not the that is likely to happen ) the cargo logistics of the eu is going to take a massive beating . 
  why not cycle trough the netherlands . 
  it has perfect cycling infrastructure , it 's flat as dime and our rail system is build with people who bring bikes along on train rides in mind . 
  just park your car in groningen ( a city in the north ) and cycle 270 km to breda ( a city in the south ) . 
  you will almost never have to share the road with a car and the train ride back to your car only takes ~ 3h . 
   we are a rather small and really unrelevant country . 
  i would not call your country small . 
  it 's bigger then the czech republic , denmark ( without greenland ) , switzerland , ireland , estonia and the netherlands . 
  your economy ( in terms of nominal gdp ) is the 28th largest in the world . 
  that 's bigger then the gdp of norway , iran , ireland or finland . 
  yeah , we did it !, 
  just pm the mod team . 
  link is in the sidebar, 
   where does your tap-water come from ? 
  60 % ground water , 39 % river water and 1 % dune water ( gravity fed sand filtration . 
  it 's one of the perks of building your country below sea level )  and how is it processed ? 
  water aeration . 
  polyelectrolytes are added to improve coagulation and sedimentation of particles suspended in the water . 
  disinfection using uv radiation or ozone gas . 
  slow sand filation, 
  france : [ le fabuleux destin d'am\u00e9lie poulain ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/ ) germany : [ christiane f. -- wir kinder vom bahnhof zoo ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082176/ ) italy : [ kaos ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087537/ ) u.k : [ trainspotting ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/ ) china : [ house of flying daggers ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385004/ ), 
   families starting scholarship funds for local students . 
  you get scholarships from the goverment over here so that does n't happen . 
  you can go to the fanciest university even if both your parents are on welfare . 
   in my community a young girl suffers from a rare pediatric cancer , so her parents started a charity 5k race to raise awareness of the disease and also raise money , which is donated to research the disease . 
  most people over here would raise money to donate to one of the national foundations . 
  like kwf kankerbestrijding ( queen wilhelmina fund for cancer research and prevention )  is it common for ` regular people ' to raise money or awareness towards a cause they care about ? 
  yes but they hardly ever start their own charity . 
  they often volunteer for a national charity ( our country is small af so national is n't really that big to begin with ) or they organize a local event to raise money for that charity ( like a concert or a sporting event ), 
  you want me to clean that image up a bit ? 
  there are white pixels where the black meets the blue and question bubble could use some anti-aliasing . 
  all of saint nic 's helpers across europe should band together and form a labour union . 
  that way they can more effectively negotiate insurance benefits that cover the medical bill of all the rsi and carpal tunnel syndrome they get from beating the ever loving shit out of children all day long . 
  that 's that famous german efficiency and work ethics for ya !, 
  the netherlands ( pop . 
  ~ 17 million ) needs 6 to 8 guys at peak physical condition to beat up all the naughty children . 
  germany 's ( pop . 
  ~ 81 million ) child beating needs are covered by a single senior citizen . 
  santa clause just does n't give you presents if you are a naughty kid . 
  sinterklaas send a group of black men into your bedroom in the middle of the night to beat you with sicks , put you in a bag and drag you of to spain to work in his mansion . 
  they also have [ frisian `` kiss and ride '' signs ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cmnito8woaaovat.jpg ), 
  not every frisian sign has the frisian name on the top , only certain municipalities have that . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/88/c1/b5/88c1b53c8bdb0ab0d876069593de575b.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://hip.tresprojecten.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/naambord-heerenveen.bmp ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.dewoudklank.nl/files/2011/10/plaatsnaambord-bakkeveen-gemeente-opsterland-foto-mark-van-der-meulen.jpg ), 
  you guys also use the turkish made [ mpt-76 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mpt-76 ) rifle right ? 
  the main service rifle is a colt canada c8nld or a c7nld . 
  the hk416 is only used by special forces ( nlmarsof , ktc and the bsb ), 
  yeah i think this is not really to discriminate . 
  sanquin ( the dutch bloodbank ) is literally swimming in blood . 
  with the supply of blood donors being so large , changing a rule like this gets put low on the list of priorities . 
  though i do feel that lifting the ban formally hold some symbolic value when it comes to gay rights in nl . 
   entirely equal as straight people , no ifs nor buts . 
  [ except for donating blood if you are a man who has sex with men . 
  ] ( https://www.government.nl/topics/gay-rights/contents/equal-rights-for-gays-and-transgenders ), 
  do the people living in remote areas only speak those minority languages or are they also capable of speaking russian fluently ? 
  even within the province of frysl\u00e2n you have separate dialects of frisian . 
  clay frisian sounds nothing like wood frisian or city frisian . 
  the benelux is one on the global producers of synthetic drugs . 
  but meth is super rare over here . 
  i have never seen it used or sold here . 
  ( and i 've seen alot of other stuff being used/sold ), 
  i speak a completely different language ( frisian ) then people living in amsterdam . 
   we already have space to grow tulips . 
  yeah but tulips grow better on lake beds , we grow all our tulips on reclaimed land . 
   maybe let that idea drop . 
  that 's almost 4000 kilometers . 
  we are quite good at building polders . 
  if you combine dutch expertise with the american industrial infrastructure and massive work force , no challenge is to big to take on . 
  more space to grow tulips . 
  pump dry the great lakes . 
  maybe create a polder linking up hawaii to the continental us . 
  turks run most of the telecom/phone repair stores over here . 
  partisanship is kinda hard when your country has multi party system with 28 parties competing in the last election . 
  the left vs right divide is a bit vague when you have multiple parties on the right that do n't agree with each other on numerous issues . 
  ( for example ; the vvd is on the right and thinks the eu is great and the pvv is on the right and hates the eu ), 
  the only place i ever see bars of soap is in hotels . 
  most of the branded soaps over here are from unilever brands like dove . 
  the game was actuality causing damage to our flood protection systems . 
  there were pokemon nests located in the sand dunes protecting parts of the holland region . 
  player were going of the paths and trammeling the marram grass planted to protect the dune from wind errosion . 
  players trespassing also caused disturbances for bids nesting in the protected dune area . 
  [ authorities from the the hague ended up suing the company behind the game for damages ] ( https://gamerant.com/pokemon-go-netherlands-court-112/ ), 
  i sometimes bud in . 
  i also feel people from the us are able to bring interesting viewpoints to the table when answering questions here . 
  european and american cultures have a lot in common due to them being highly developed/industialised western cultures , but they are also very different when it comes to certain subjects . 
  probably the same reason why i visit / r/askanamerican or / r/askeurope . 
  a general interest in the opinions of people from other nations . 
  op ... what do you think of yours ? 
  [ mark rutte ] ( http://jongrijk.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/vraag-aan-mark.jpg ) while i do n't agree with his party 's politics i do believe he is a decent human being and a good politician .
