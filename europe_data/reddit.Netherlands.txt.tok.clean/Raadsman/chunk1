thanks for the clarification !, 
  iirc the deal will send registered refugees to europe in return of illegal refugees . 
  so the composition will stay . 
  you can disagree with it but it isnt racist, 
  why racist ? 
  why isnt it racist to say that people wish the germans never invaded poland but it is racist to say turkic tribes should have never invaded west asia ? 
  thanks for the sources . 
  last thing we need is another war in the world . 
  azerbaijan is playing a dangerous game . 
  the place is ethnically armenian . 
  azerbaijan has n't had a good record of treating armenian civilians properly . 
  is this your excuse ? 
  that we had it too ? 
  there is a reason why we dont have it anymore . 
  and next time you defend the peaceful turkish army do n't forget this report please :  ( istanbul ) -- kurdish civilians , including women , children and elderly residents , have been killed during security operations and armed clashes since july 2015 in southeastern turkey . 
  local human rights groups have recorded well over 100 civilian deaths and multiple injuries . 
  after unprecedented military deployments to the region in recent days , several cities are under curfew and some of their neighborhoods the scenes of shelling by the military and heavy clashes with armed kurdish groups . 
  the civilian death toll is likely to rise steeply in the coming days . 
  it 's not just the bbc , hrw has a very detailed report about turkish army killing kurdish children and elderly .

  this is your response ? 
  instead of condemning the turkish terrorist attacks against kurdish civilians ? 
  you and i both know that they branded it that way just because turkey demanded it . 
  pkk flag is being raised by people in every european capital . 
  you are such a liar . 
  muslims actually praise turkey and call erdogan the new muslim leader of the world . 
  hamas leader literally said that erdogan is the leader of the muslim world . 
  the leader of the islamic organization was/is turkish .

  should kurds support the turkish army who has killed children , women , men and elderly ?

  turkish army has repeatedly killed kurdish civilians , many human rights have reports on this . 
  i dont understand why turks deny so much atrocities .

  pkk uses kids , and turkish state kills innocent children : a 53-year old mother of seven , meryem sune 's body rests on a desk , wrapped in white cloth and bed sheets . 
   what is unusual about the picture taken in cizre , a predominantly kurdish town in south-eastern turkey , are the bottles of ice surrounding her body . 
   ms sune was hit by shrapnel and died of her injuries , as she was not allowed into hospital for treatment , local reports say - due to a curfew declared over a week ago . 
   she could not be buried for two days and her body was first kept cold by ice bottles , and then in the freezer of a chicken shop . 
  or google '' turkish army cizre '' and you 'll see how turkish terrorist army has killed hundreds of kurds . 
  you can argue that turkey is the biggest child-soldier recruiter as they ** force ** people to go fight through conscription . 
  so you want them to fight with stones and sticks ? 
  you are really ignorant . 
  the target wa the military . 
  the pkk is a legit rebel organization fighting turkish jihadist terrorist state . 
  pkk is not a terrorist organization . 
  not every armed rebel group is a terrorist organization . 
  the attack was on the military . 
  mostlikely , it was in the southeast and the target was the military . 
  you have been proven to be fake . 
  you deny every atrocity against kurds . 
  it 's funny how people were raging and blaming pkk for every thing the last few days . 
  nationalist turks with a clear anti-pkk agenda will claim every attack on pkk . 
  every attack . 
  it has been so far that the pro-kurdish hdp was accused by nationalist turks to bomb themselves in order to get votes . 
  the sad thing is , pkk hasnt operated in western turkey for a while now . 
  the ankara bombings was done by tak , a group that splintered of pkk because pkk avoids western turkey . 
  and what do people still do ? 
  - man falls of bridge ? 
  blame pkk - tak bombs , claims responsbility ? 
  say quickly they are pkk to demonize pkk - turkish forces literally destroy sur , cizre and nusaybin kurdish towns ? 
  everything is done in order to demonize pkk into a powerful , almighty monster that eats turks on a daily basis . 
  i dont blame nationalist turks and erdoganists on blaming pkk . 
  pkk fights for kurds , something that islamists and nationalists dont like because it undermines islamism/turkish nationalism . 
  \\ but i do blame europeans who fall for this crap . 
  these are the same conspiracy theories like arabs have on syria/iraq ( european countries destroy everything , isis is european , every bomb america drops is on civilians etc ) . 
   i do n't expect you to understand but the pkk killed a bunch of people in our capital just three days ago and you 're asking why we 're biased ? 
  the pkk has been attacking civilians , not just military for over 3 decades . 
  turkey has systematically , extensively and broadly killed kurdish civilians . 
  literally 10 times more than pkk ever did . 
  so whats your point ? 
  if we have to judge based on how many civilians died . 
  turkey is worse than pkk . 
  turkey is then even worse than isis because isis never killed 13 000 civilians in 1 attack but turkey killed more than 11 000 kurdish civilians ** in one attack ** including * women and children * in dersim way before pkk even existed :  according to an official report of the fourth general ispectorate , 13,160 civilians were killed by the turkish army and 11,818 people were taken into exile , depopulating the province . 
  [ 6 ] according to the dersimi , many tribesmen were shot dead after surrendering , and women and children were locked into haysheds which were then set on fire . 
  [ 45 ] according to mcdowall , 40,000 people were killed . 
  [ 1 ] according to kurdish diaspora sources , over 70,000 people were killed . 
  [ 46 ] [ ** warning , very nsfw : turkish forces beheading a kurdish man and proudly making pictures of it . 
  reminds me too much of the isis beheadings ** ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/turkish_soldiers_with_a_head_cut_off.jpg ) . 
  why are you so biased ? 
  90 % + of the pkk-turkey conflict has been taken place in kurdish majority towns/villages/cities . 
  turkish civilians have been the smallest victims of the pkk turkey conflict . 
  and attacking turkish army is not terrorism but militancy . 
  no , everybody tried to blame pkk but it was islamic state . 
  is n't it funny how disinformation works ? 
  some people with a clear agenda blame pkk and immediately everybody uses confirmation bias instead of looking at who really did it . 
  the guy was literally a terrorist leader , who at least wanted to rule a country without waging war against its neighbours constantly . 
  he had made his country a relative success compared to the rest of africa , his people had free healthcare and his army was integrated into society . 
  yes he wasnt a democrat , but why do we think that only democrats are good things ?
