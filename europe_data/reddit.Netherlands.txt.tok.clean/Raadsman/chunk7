  [ 38 ] [ 149 ] [ 150 ] cnn reported in 2000 that the grey wolves with most pro-chechen stance were those affiliated with the islamist great union party ( bbp ) , which had split from mhp in 1993 . 
  the article suggested that they `` run the mosques and commercial activities in some parts of istanbul . 
  it is in these mosques , in the suburbs of the city , that offerings are collected after daily prayers for the chechen refugees . 
  it is money that probably also goes to soldiers on the front lines . 
  '' [ 150 ] according to svante cornell it is `` widely believed that the grey wolves organised arms shipments to chechnya , probably with at least the partial knowledge of the turkish authorities . 
  '' [ 151 ] russian media has alleged that the turkish government knew and possibly supported , or at least did not prevent , the activities of the grey wolves in chechnya . 
  it 's more of a terrorist mindset . 
  the akp has had huge influence on the turkish population the last decade . 
  it turned into a we , [ the muslims versus the infidels ] debate pretty quickly . 
  this has led to both religious radicalization as nationalist radicalization the last year . 
  i 'm afraid the amount of turkish terrorists will only increase with akp as leading party . 
   kurdish `` rebels '' are the exact definition of terrorists . 
  according to most countries in the world , they do not . 
   same goes for many jihadi organizations in syria , supported by turkey and saudi arabia . 
  what happens when they get their hands on syria ? 
  an islamic caliphate similar to what turkey will become . 
   pkk is much older than every other armed group in syria a why ? 
  i doubt it has something to do with the injustice against kurdish people / s  also the methods they used caused them to be called as terrorists . 
  not your political affiliation . 
  which methods ? 
  killing civilians . 
  then by definition turkey is the prime example of terrorism . 
  a whole wiki about turkey 's support for terrorism . 
  and i 'm not even talking about its own human rights abuses , genocidal denial , destruction of christian heritage and hostility towards eu/usa . 
  i mean if we see it from the terrorists perspective , what 's the point in attacking a village far away from `` kurdistan '' . 
  it 's funny how the syrian jihadists ( supported by turkey ) are '' rebels '' but the kurdish rebels are '' terrorists '' . 
  that 's what turkish media does always . 
  they have no sense of objectivty whatsoever . 
  i remember a turkish propaganda site blaming their earthquakes on pkk and america saying they wanted to destroy turkey 's natural resources . 
  so that the eu will sanction your country under the lead of merkel ? 
  they would never do that in my country . 
  there is a famous dutch mosque in amsterdam which regularly [ invited jihadist-financiers from syria ] ( http://www.carelbrendel.nl/2016/01/18/amsterdamse-extremisten-maken-gebruik-van-el-tawheed-moskee/ ) and the mosque is still open . 
  [ another mosque was being run by an ex-member ] ( http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/27095972/__extremisme_infiltreert__.html ) of the hofstadgroup , a terrorist organization in the netherlands . 
  there is a good side in this conflict . 
  the ypg now part of the syrian democratic forces is not perfect . 
  there have been cases of abuse against arab families of which some members of the family supported isis . 
  that being said they are a ** million ** times better than any other side of the conflict . 
  let 's see who the other side is : - assad/iran/russia . 
  i do n't have to say much but i will . 
  the guy has gassed its own people , runs death chambers , bombs civilians indiscriminately through barrel bombs - '' moderate rebels '' ( supported by qatar , saudi arabia and turkey ) : they are no different than isis [ and also behead children ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-javad-zarif-us-beheaded-boy-syria-fsa-rebels-deafening-silence/ ) . 
  they fight for an islamic state and want to kill all the christians , alawites ( assads sect ) and other minorities . 
  - isis - i dont even have to say anything now i can tell you 1 thing . 
  that even though ypg is not perfect with cases of abuse , they by far destroy every other faction in terms of human rights and respect for civilians . 
  in fact while assad and the '' moderate rebels '' torture you in prison , the ypg even treats isis prisoners relatively good ( in part so that isis fighters also surrender instead of fight until the end ) . 
   ask pro pkk sources . 
  maybe if turkey allowed free press , or any press at all in those areas not pro-akp , then people would n't believe those pkk sources . 
  nothing to worry about , guys . 
  according to the secular nationalists nobody takes erdogan serious and it is all a show for internal consumption . 
  the rape , killing of civilians , human rights abuses and tyranny against other countries is all just for votes . 
  does n't happen at all . 
  well yes , it is no secret that bringing millions of muslims ** will also mean you have the extremists with them ** . 
  do people really think that the extremists will think * oh they didnt invite us so we will not go there ! * ? 
  shaking my head for this naivity . 
  yes , and gulen is supported by the cia . 
  just like germany , austria , france , netherlands also support pkk and gulen at the same time to attack the strong independent turkey !, 
   no , no armenians `` became '' kurds they `` became '' turks when they were forcfully converted everybody becomes a turk once you are in the eyes of turkish imperialism . 
  they even claim the huns to be turkic , only because those people also came from central asia ( and totally ignore the fact that for example persians were also settled in central asia which according to their logic would make persians also turks ) . 
  with that being said , i love armenian people and armenian culture . 
  always have good talks with dutch armenians . 
  i 've never heard of them causing trouble here either . 
  just wanted to point out that i 'm glad to live in a europe where there is more harmony than bad-blood rivalry between us . 
  people take it for granted how much our grandfathers have fought for this . 
  i often hear the * we are just lucky to be born here instead of in another side of the world * , totally ignoring how many european have died and fought for these ideals and standards . 
  we are not lucky to be born here , europeans earned it . 
  and it would be extremely silly to destroy europe by simply taking it for granted what freedom is : what europe is . 
  european solidarity and norms do not mean allowing others to create destructive societies inside our europe ( i.e. 
  islamism ) , european solidarity means defending eachother against those intollerance . 
  yes because he fought for the kurds , the '' national security threat '' that turkey accuses of being part of pkk , which has been refuted many times . 
  is n't it funny that the so-called national security threat ( syrian kurdish ypg ) has never attacked turkey and actually called upon turkey to support them ? 
  turkey calls syrian kurds terrorist yet this is the group that turks support :  it also expanded its operations against the assad regime in 2015 by co-creating the jaysh al-fatah ( army of conquest ) umbrella organization , which pushed the syrian army out of the idlib governorate in june 2015 . 
  [ 20 ] as a result of jaysh al-fatah 's victory , turkey and saudi arabia began funding ahrar al-sham in order to bolster syrian opposition forces . 
  [ 21 ] http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/523 even if you are against the ypg , just know . 
  it 's absolutely horrifying to be in a turkish prison . 
  this is what they do against their own people , let alone what they do to people who they consider to be a foreigner :  detainees have been beaten , sexually abused and threatened with rape by turkish police , human rights watch has claimed . 
   in a 43-page report published on tuesday , the human rights group said a `` climate of fear '' had prevailed since july 's failed coup against president tayyip recep erdogan and the arrest of thousands under a state of emergency . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/detainees-beaten-sexually-abused-and-threatened-with-rape-after-failed-turkey-coup-gives-blank-check-a7379526.html this is the '' democratic republic of turkey '' which is as democratic as north korea or china . 
  so you dont believe that paper , but you do believe this '' one example '' an american pro-immigration think tank brings up . 
  yes ** some ** , but most ** do n't ** . 
  the atlantic is a pro-immigration think thank , who would think they would write something in favor of more muslim immigration ? 
  for every '' good story '' about a syrian not wanting to go to the mosque , there are 10 syrians who do want to go . 
  i would argue that being killed is being better than being tortured and raped like in turkey . 
  i just dont even want to imagine what they would do to a journalist accused of having ties to gulen . 
  poor people . 
  you cant be a democracy and jail journalists . 
  and yes turkey is worse than china . 
   most of us have n't . 
  he 's just a populist , nobody takes what he says seriously , nobody tries t and most of us have come to understand that the turks at this subreddit try damage control as much as they can . 
  if '' most of you '' really did n't take him serious he would n't transform turkey from a parliamentary to a dictator-like presidential system . 
  i was thinking ` is n't it an actual bad thing to refer to the 15th century to refer to a good deed ? ', 
  but luckily you were sarcastic . 
   in turkish politics `` nationalist '' and `` islamists '' are considered almost mutually exclusive , even though they clearly are not ( as seen from the article ) . 
  still , they 're treated separate . 
  this is because nationalists focus on the turkish identity , while islamists try to merge turkish identity with arabic culture . 
  that 's maybe in theory , not in reality . 
  in reality , even the mhp the so called nationalist party is a sectarian , islamist party . 
  yes , the party that according to the theory would be nationalist , is the most sectarian out there : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mara\u015f_massacre  that 's an inaccurate statement . 
  there are many nationalists who are borderline nazi sympathizers . 
  they range from `` i do n't want anyone to come in my country anymore and also want to hang those who have betrayed their nation '' to `` i want a pan-turkic shamanist nation '' , and in any case they 're ultra secular because they hate arabs . 
  in actual politics , you only see the former people as those who want a pan-turkic state are both a small minority and also they ca n't gather much support due to the fact that majority of the country is n't even turkic . 
  it does n't matter how many nationalist parties there are .
