  i would 've sworn , by the looks of it , this could easily be the veluwe . 
  all of this in such a small open area ? 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/ufmihhz0w7a?t=15m24s ) when i was kid , i did n't get the references . 
  * [ baantjer ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111887/ ) * [ toen was geluk heel gewoon ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108964/ ) * [ fort alpha ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140056/ ) then ofc there 's the smurfs as well . 
  ca n't blame them really . 
  i was a marine in special operations for 6 years before nearly my entire squad got laid off due to budget cuts ( thanks vvd voters ) . 
  having jumped straight into the military after school finding a job was hard . . the only job i could get my hands on was being a police officer which , quite frankly , is n't a job i intend on doing for longer than i have to . 
  they promise you an education while in the military but there 's never any time to study and i have never heard of anyone successfully completing his education if he/she actually got permission to do so . 
  being from a `` degree/diploma country '' , experience means almost nothing so that does n't help either . 
  school first , still want to join the military after you 're done ? 
  go for it . 
  nah , the netherlands is quite a wealthy country and we have always been competitive with germany . 
  we pay more for pretty much everything thus the germans have more money left to buy nice things when we barely do . 
   on dutch -- `` - why did ikea stop opening stores in the netherlands ? '' `` - they could n't afford the free pencils anymore '' . 
  right in the feels man , right in the feels . 
  [ jeuj !, 
  i 'd say norway because of the landscape , but most likely sweden . 
  the lifestyle is cheaper compared to my country . 
  anyone saying the netherlands is either in a position where they earn a good amount or money or they 're a little crazy . 
  this country was nice ... once ... until we got a greedy government whom 's definition of `` cutting back cost '' was `` let 's raise taxes and add even more random taxes on top of it '' . 
  citroen cars and baguette . 
   in addition , they must pay a tax of five swiss francs per night of work . 
  that 's not the only tax they have to pay ... right ? 
  there 's also an income tax ? 
  i honestly have no clue how i 'd be able to afford a 1000 euro rent and i 'm a police officer . 
  healthcare , car insurance , road taxes , gasoline , funeral insurance , electricity and gas , water , food ... oh the list is too long . 
  i do n't even have any ( expensive ) hobbies aside from the gym ( 20 euro 's a month ) . 
  it does n't matter where you are from , even asylum seekers who get money from the government are able to get into social homing and often get `` urgent rights '' meaning they do n't have to wait at all . 
  i 'm a socialist at heart , but at the moment some things in this country can make me tear up considering i 'm a retired marine that had to move back in with his mother after getting a honorable discharge due to government budget cuts . 
  it 's shameful , though all my friends except for one ( female , married ) still live with their parents in their mid twenties . 
  social houses are houses owned by a corporation that have rents up to a maximum of 681,02 euro 's a month . 
  your income ca n't be higher than 34.229 , - a year ( all those living inside combined ) . 
  if you wish to have a normal family home and you are not renting from a social corporation you will be paying around 1000 euro 's a month ... and somebody that 's single simply ca n't afford that unless you have a very , very well paid job but in that case you 'd most likely not be renting in the first place . 
  sadly though , since eastern europeans started coming to our country over these last 10 years the waiting list has been going up and up meaning that if you 're young and start getting on that list you will have to wait 7 to 30 years . 
  with 7 years you can get a small flat if you 're very lucky . 
  but you start with 0 points , you get 1 point each month . 
  foreigners start with 25 to 50 points meaning they get years of a head start right off the bat due to them living far away from their jobs and ... well , as you prolly understand it pisses a lot of dutch people off and creates tension . 
  many houses are empty but they are too expensive for your average person . 
  at the moment , we 're not buyers but renters . 
  the average time for a social home is 7 to 30 years depending on the type of house and location . 
  it 's quite hard to put a house that you own up for rent due to complicated laws surrounding it . 
  somebody that 's single , has almost no chance to buy a house unless you have an extremely well paying job thus making the social houses in demand . 
  land is expensive , at the moment land is so expensive that buying land + building a house does n't give you much ( if any ) of a profit thus people are n't investing in this as it 'd be a stupid thing to do . 
  that 's true . 
  if you 're dutch and you manage to get a job near the german border it 's foolish not to live in germany . 
  cars are cheaper , road taxes are cheaper , gas is cheaper , houses are cheaper ... the list goes on and on . 
  though my german is pretty good , sadly i do n't have a job near the border :(, 
  houses are still too expensive tbh . 
  if my mother could pick up her swedish house and land and place it right here in the netherlands , she 'd be a multi-millionaire . 
  over here you get a 3 bedroom house with a pathetic small yard for about 300.000 euro 's while that same price got her a 6 bedroom 2 bathroom house , with a basement , 2 garages and 5h of land ... it makes me sad really . 
  yes , i 'm aware houses in cities are more expensive , but i 'm not talking about city houses in the netherlands either . 
  becuase the fsa is known for their terrorist connections and activities . 
  [ they are so friendly and obviously fighting for freedom ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eevzazec7dk ) just one example that is n't about slaughtering people for having a different opinion . 
  just bullying , humiliating and beating the shit out of a mentally ill man . 
  let him stay there . 
  allow the rest of his family to join him if they want to , pay for their one way ticket . . it 's a worthy investment . 
  the `` duitsen bloed '' is actualy `` dietsen bloed '' which means dutch / of orange blood . 
  could do with a change though as `` duits '' only means german now and the word , other than knowing what it used to mean , has no common meaning now . 
  the best thing ? 
  the fact that the country actually cares about its citizens . 
  they care enough to make sure every single citizen has a place in a bunker in case of a war . 
  not to mention it being one of the very few actual democratic countries in the world where the citizens get to choose on law adjustments such as the gun laws and immigration laws . 
  may we follow in their footsteps . 
  our national anthem has been changed several times but the `` god '' and `` honoring the king of spain '' parts are still in there ... we 're due for a change as well . 
  amsterdam does n't surprise me . 
  blackjack , hookers , weed , alcohol ... vegas ai n't got shit on us . 
  [ ukrainian women ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqphxtugzi ), 
  idk , the latest research showed only 14 % is obese so it ca n't be that bad . 
  that said , chinese food tends to be healthy . 
  as a dutch person , i 've never ordered indonesian , tacos , tortillas and i do n't even know what couscous is supposed to be . 
  then again , i live hours away from the multi-cultural areas so that might be why . 
  [ frikandel ] ( http://vandraeckensteijn.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/frikandel_speciaal.jpg ) ( or in this case , `` frikandel speciaal '' ) and anything related to potatoes ... you ca n't have dutch blood and not eat potatoes , that 'd be madness . 
  i guess i was pretty lucky considering [ this ] ( https://maps.google.nl/maps?hl=nl&amp;ll=52.181037,5.766578&amp;spn=0.011618,0.033023&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=52.181366,5.766929&amp;panoid=zvwauo5ds61dhs7k6igiia&amp;cbp=12,320.64,,0,4.8 ) is the house i grew up in . 
  all the land you see was ours , did n't have any animals ourselves but lots of people from neighbouring city `` arhnem '' that wanted a horse came to us to rent a stall which brought in a nice amount of money ... sadly this country retardedly expensive and it was more profitable to sell the house and buy a mansion in sweden with twice as much land than it was to stay there . 
  that 's a high end swift . 
  remember you get tax breaks . 
  so all in all it should be [ roughly 9k ] ( http://www.suzuki.nl/nmg/up/zmibnnuimf_suz_swift-prijskaart_3drs_web_jan13_9-1.pdf ) at absolute most . 
  if you keep your folks around for several years , 3k a year - that 's about 3 years worth of public transportation . 
  tax breaks on fuel makes fuel about 1.40 a liter at most and the fuel consumption on a swift is [ about 5 liters per 100 kilometers ] ( http://www.autoweek.nl/auto/58197/suzuki-swift-12-base ) . 
  of course , you wo n't have to do the regular inspection ( apk ) and there 's a guarantee for a decent amount of miles saving maintenance as well . 
  i guess you have a point there but it really , really depends on if you plan on having somebody around . 
  my mother runs several bilderberg hotels and it 's by far cheaper to offer your employees a car ( think suzuki swift like car ) as opposed to public transportation . 
  you get tax breaks on road taxes , insurance , gasp prices and also on the car itself as you 're buying it as a company . 
  besides , does n't every cao have a `` reiskostenvergoeding '' as a basic requirement or are there some without ? 
  then you 're one of the very few that are lucky , most are not . 
  lucky because i know the pains of ( expensive ) parking in amsterdam but most employers do not pay for public transportation as they would rather get you a car on lease as that is cheaper . 
  have n't been on public transportation for years but i can imagine it can also be quite uncomfortable considering the amount of kids in it compared to adults . 
  public transportation could be 11 % , you know why ? 
  because our public transportation system is the most retarded system you 've ever encountered . 
  if you 're not a student ( whom may travel for free while they study ) you 're shit out of luck and you 're forced to pay a boatload of money to get from a to b. 
  it 's so expensive that , where i live , you see only empty busses driving around because owning a car is a lot more cheaper than using public transport . 
  it 's a huge money scam and it 's only getting worse every time something new is `` forced '' upon the general public . 
  you 're a foreigner visiting the netherlands and you wish to travel ? 
  you are forced to buy a `` ov-chipkaart '' in order to travel , which costs money , then you have to put a minimum amount of money on it which costs even more , not empty and you 're leaving the country ? 
  shit out of luck , it has an expiration date . 
  why is this being downvoted ? 
  it this / r/europe or / r/middleages ? 
  it 's obviously fucked up to beat the shit out of gay people for being gay , raping lesbians to `` make them come around '' , cops not doing anything when they see gay people get beat up or throwing them in jail simply for being gay . 
  this is going back in time and it 's disgusting . 
  what 's next ?
