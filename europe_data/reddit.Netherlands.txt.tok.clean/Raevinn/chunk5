  a camp surrounded by barb wire specially designed for homosexuals ? 
  i know norway 's expensive but did n't know it was that much . 
  so what prevents one from importing a car from sweden to norway ? 
  here in the netherlands we have an illegal tax ( as by european court ) called `` bpm '' which is 100 % for a new car and gradually lowers depending on the car 's age . 
  meaning there 's no point buying a car from abroad if you wish to save money . 
  at least everything is cheaper in sweden compared to the netherlands . 
  my mother now lives in sweden and bought a new mercedes recently . 
  she ended up paying roughly 30.000 euro 's for it when that exact same mercedes is 42.000 ~ euro 's here in the netherlands . 
  insurance and road taxes are four times as cheap and her house was roughly twice as cheap not to mention the cost of food which is also cheaper and healthcare ... well i guess you know that story . 
  all in all , she has quite a bit more money left after every day expenses after moving to sweden . 
  i 'd happily trade our tax ( ofc also health care system ) with yours . 
  no , because the body has a limit . 
  if you work out for 4/5 years you will have reached that limit and there is absolutely no reason to stop somebody from taking steroids if he ( or she . . ) has the desire to . 
  it 's his body and he has the right to do with it what he wishes to do with it . 
  bodybuilding is a sport that requires a serious amount of dedication and precision and the human body slowly becomes weaker in hormones as you age . 
  steroids ( or even hgh ) keep the body in a top level and even beyond human power if one has the desire to do so allowing the body to become bigger while remaining healthy ( even healthier than the average person ) in the process . 
  there 's no reason to allow a woman that wants to become a man to take steroids legally but deny men ( again , or women ) that wish to become stronger because `` it 's unethical '' ( thanks to the media and misinformed people ) . 
  it 's science , there 's no reason not to progress in it and accept that we are able to make ourselves better which the proper use of these medical accessories . 
  there 's a huge , huge difference between anabolic steroids and hard drugs . 
  i hope you 're aware of them , the destructive behavior and addiction are just the beginning . 
  i never said it should n't be regulated but with help of a doctor it 'll be a lot better and more pure , it 'll remove the majority of underground laboratories we have creating them now as the only way a doctor is ( legally ) allowed to prescribe them to you is for medical reasons which , once you 're 40 years or older , are naturally ready for unless you 're some kind of hormonal god . 
  not really . 
  if you 're a healthy male and know how to use steroids there are no permanent side effects to be found . 
  there 's a huge difference between use and abuse . 
  there 's a proper way to use it , once you know what it is and have regular checks done by a doctor you will never be in any danger . 
  do n't buy into what the media says , do your own research , believe scientists . 
  why has this been on this board so often lately ? 
  is n't it generally known already ? 
  times where different , all you had to do was walk into a doctor 's office and say `` hey , i would like some steroids '' and you 'd get them . 
  arnold schwarzenegger started taking them at the age of 13 and it 's not like they had a bad reputation back then either ( i honestly do n't know why they do these days outside of professional sports ) . 
  was it even considered cheating back then ? 
  germany had what other countries did not have at the time . 
  god knows why the dutch prime minister earns that much , he 's one of the biggest screw ups we 've had for quite a while . 
  it 's about time we finally got a democratic people 's person rather than a greedy pocket filler . 
  at least france is taking a stand unlike my country who 's america 's lapdog . 
  i still do n't understand how we 're just able to swallow the [ `` hague invasion act '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_service-members'_protection_act ) . 
  the netherlands is a devil in a box ? 
  interesting . 
  sorry , i thought ** european ** union meant something . 
  yeah if we could go ahead and not add turkey ( which continent is mostly in asia to begin with ) to the eu , that 'd be great . 
  obama 's just keeping a backup of your harddrive in case you forget to make a backup yourself . 
  what a joke of a punishment . 
  i had illegal fireworks in the netherlands , 3 so called [ strijkers ] ( http://www.freewebs.com/mmit/strijker.jpg ) and when i got caught i had 30 hours of community service to do . 
  how the fuck does a gang rape get that little sentence ? 
  when are we going to start deporting these people ? 
  a `` 3 generation '' deportation law would reduce crime significantly . 
  for the record , the netherlands needs more police officers but there 's a budget to work with that has been decreased steadily year by year . 
  like myself , a lot of police officers can only get a part time job which really does n't pay the bills and the wage is laughable . 
  therefor , not many people are interested in being police officers as it 's a fairly expensive country to live in . 
  sadly , after my contract in the military did n't get extended due to budget cuts , this was the only job i could get . 
  do it , i very much doubt the us would have the balls to challenge the germans anyway . 
  specially now that the germans have the entire eu standing behind them . 
   somebody needs to explain to germans that they are not being invaded by hungry grasshoppers who come to demolish their welfare system . 
  the video says otherwise . 
  in other words , get fired at 60 , live off wellfare and get your pension . 
  sounds like a plan . 
  [ what ? 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/upd7g1wkw28?t=2m5s ), 
  i 'm a part time police officer because it was the only job i could get after leaving the military . 
  due to it being part time the pay is shit and i do n't like the job . 
  can i get another job ? 
  nope , everything requires 3 + years of experience and a degree . 
  even the most simple jobs require experience and a degree these days in this country , it 's getting a bit silly . 
  my mother runs several hotels ... no degree in anything and started out as cleaning lady . 
  my grandpa was underwater welder and worked on an oil rig , started as a rookie and did n't have a degree in anything . 
  pretty much the same story with most other folks over 40 that i know . 
  we dutch take quite a bit of pride being the very first country in the world to allow gay marriage , gay acceptance is huge here ... it 's a live and let live country . 
  often ignored in world polls :(,

  i do n't think anyone sees my country , if they do it tends to be about folks wearing clogs , having tulips in their yard , being high on weed all day and loving football ( soccer ) . 
  oh god ... there are like 80 different kinds of bread in the bakery i go to here in the netherlands i honestly have no clue what 's dutch and what is n't . 
  i tend to buy something we call an [ `` italiaanse bol '' ] ( http://www.bakerystars.nl/afbeeldingen/producten/fb__italiaanse_bol_piemonte.jpg ) , something italian , not sure how it 's translated exactly . 
  do n't worry , another income tax incoming in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  my favorite vacation destination , let 's keep it . 
  and steroids , thank you . 
  i used several of them to buy a motorcycle but here in the netherlands stores generally do not accept 250 or 500 euro notes which is ridiculous . 
  so i was correct then , 
  there 's a point in that , however as it currently stands there is no proper resistance and they are doing whatever they want to do because nothing is stopping them . 
  there has been riots in my own country and they never last long due to the force that 's opposite of it ( the police ) . 
  they will use their batons , arrest people , use water cannons , tear gas if need be and perform charges with horses . 
  looking at sweden , it makes me sad that all these `` youths '' are getting away with it by the looks of it . 
  the swedes could always ask some dutch or british support on this matter , we have plenty of experience with soccer hooligan riots and solve it quite quickly . 
  you 'd be surprised how well a watergun works on human flesh , i 've seen people get blasted several meters away by it and they did n't get up for a while but did n't need medical attention . 
  that said , rumors go that bullets also work wonders in these types of situation , i believe they call that `` natural selection '' . 
  up until recently blasphemy was forbidden in the town i live in , even though nobody has gotten a ticket or penalty for it in the last 100 years the law was still in place . 
  which was funny considering roughly 80 % that lives here does n't believe in a god . 
  kuwait is deporting people for traffic violations . 
  why ca n't we deport people for performing criminal acts ? 
  i hate to break it to you , but a machete can kill as well . 
  i 'm a police officer , and if somebody has a knife that 'd be considered a deadly object thus deadly force is allowed . 
  what do you expect ? 
  some bruce lee action to take his/her weapon away ? 
  come in close and pepper spray and risk losing my life or limbs ? 
  sorry , but it 's a dog eat dog world and if you play with fire you might get burned . 
  the comments under that article shows how uninformed people are , it 's sad really . 
  i did ? 
  when did ** i ** do that ? 
  way to put every dutch citizen under one roof , well done sir . 
  no it 's not . 
  they use our roads , they live in this country and they paid for their benefits ?
