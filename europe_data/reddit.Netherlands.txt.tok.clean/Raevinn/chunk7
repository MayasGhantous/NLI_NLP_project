  houses here are 280.000 euro 's and up for a family home that is n't unattached and you 're lucky if you get a bedroom that 's 4 by 5 meters . 
  want a decent yard ? 
  prepare your anus , it 's roughly 3000 euro 's per square meter . 
  density . . yay !, 
  it might just be me . . but i feel very lucky to be born on this continent . 
  i do love canada but i would n't trade europe for any other continent if i had the chance . 
  a wildcat could be standing right in front of me and i 'd think it 'd be a normal house cat . 
  honestly though , i love animals and that includes pets . . but sometimes i think this small country could do well with a limit on cats that are allowed outside or in a household . 
  having heard the somewhat disturbing mesages coming from the `` bird protection '' group about cats killing too many birds at the moment it would only make it that much harder for a wildcat to be able to survive properly in this country . 
  that said , i live on the veluwe and would very much love for wolves ( and wildcats ) to come and live here . 
  protect them ( do n't allow hunters to shoot them ) while they are here and limit hunting ( on deer and boars ) to give them the space they need . 
  we have too many deer as it currently stand here on the veluwe if i might believe what 's being said so this would be a perfect solution . 
  wait until you see the children . 
  we had a few wolves in the netherlands as well a year or two ago . 
  not sure if they 're still here though . 
  who was n't racist during that time ? 
  the vast majority wanted nothing to do with anyone that were n't `` like them '' . 
  even though it 's wrong , especially this day in age , you ca n't really blame the people for thinking the way they did back then as arrogance was everywhere and people were n't as connected as they are today . 
  people are often misinformed about what the eu does and how economics work and when news articles say `` 1 in 5 want to leave the eu ! '', 
  rather than `` 4 in 5 want to stay in the eu '' it 's easy to select a scapegoat as it 's always easier to blame someone else rather than yourself . 
  you know the difference between immigrating to a country and getting a citizenship right ? 
  if wages go down too many people will be pretty `` fucked '' , at least in this country . 
  the prices on houses are ridiculous and the waiting time on a `` social '' rental house is 10 to 30 years . 
  owning a car is expensive ( based on weight ) , a bus card is really expensive ( more expensive than owning a car ) , they recently upped insurance tax by 12 % ~ , they increased taxes from 19 % to 21 % , there 's 66 % tax on regular gasoline and the list goes on and on . 
  and this is one of the countries that 's doing better than most , as far as i read and heard . 
  that 's a bit of a strange way to earn citizenship , and i 'm a person that 's all for the `` prove your worth '' approach when it comes to giving somebody a citizenship . 
  but not being able to leave the country for ten years ? 
  that 's just being a bully . 
  they should be able to leave the country for a little while so they can go on vacation just like the rest of us not to mention being able to travel through europe . 
  for one , but it 's not always `` family '' . 
  in the netherlands for example you 're allowed to bring somebody to the country without being married but you have to earn 125 % of minimum wage ( if i remember correctly ) . 
  this is often abused as one might imagine . 
  and you somehow believe that you 're only able to come to the eu based on a job ? 
  and last i checked immigration laws differ per country . 
  why would i do that ? 
  is it illegal for citizens of africa , asia and the middle east to immigrate to europe ? 
  last time i checked it was still perfectly legal and it was n't that hard to do either . 
  we often say we need them in order to fill the `` jobs people do n't want to do '' but when looking at spain 's unemployment it 's hard to imagine we ca n't fill those jobs with eu citizens . 
  you 're kidding right ? 
  it 's extremely attractive to people from all parts of the world . 
  minimum wages are higher , working conditions are far better , more freedom , better education system and the ability to become whatever you want to be . 
  or have you never been to parts of africa , the middle east and asia ? 
  if you apply , be sure to bring a m41a pulse rifle . 
  it sucks but you ca n't really blame them for wanting to do so . 
  we should have made a tight universal eu immigration law a long time ago where we 're able to give permits to high skilled workers . 
  it 's working like a charm for countries like canada and australia . 
  can they stay there please ? 
  thank you . 
  i never understood these hunters . 
  i too own a hunting license , i got out of the military and was looking for that `` thrill '' again but hunting animals was nothing like they made it out to be . 
  it was easy , they are often lured and taking a life for pleasure was n't my thing so i stopped hunting even though my hunting license is still active in sweden . 
  let 's say hunting is really your thing and you enjoy the shit out of it , how can you hunt something so badly it 'll lead to that animal 's extinction ? 
  there 'd be nothing to hunt anymore thus you 'd lose your hobby . 
  same thing is happening here in the netherlands . 
  first they want feral wolves and more wild boars ... then they get both of them and they decide to kill them because `` they 're ruining crops and eating our chickens '' ... really ? 
  nope , i 'm sticking to shooting clay pigeons . 
  oh i can posts so many videos and news articles about gay people being attacked by certain groups it 'll make your head spin , and you know it . 
  well the last thing i saw on the news was a dutch gay man living in france with his french boyfriend being attacked by a certain group which did n't look too good . 
  [ this is what i managed to find on it ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2307288/paris-gay-attack-victim-wilfred-bruijns-facebook-injuries-picture-goes-viral.html ), 
  not sure why they down voted you , it 's the truth after all . 
  the fact that every single eu state does n't have gay marriage legalized yet is beyond me . 
  guess i need to up my history lessons as world war 2 is the only one that springs to mind making it `` two time 's the charm '' which does n't make any sense . 
  the dutch prices piss me off due to 62 % tax on it some of which was `` temporary '' over ** 22 fucking years ago ** and it gets worse . 
  vehicles older than 30 years used to be `` oldtimers '' meaning they did n't have to pay road tax . 
  people that moved around a lot bought these ( they are expensive ) so they had more to spend on gas while others simply owned really old cars because they enjoyed it a few hours per month . 
  they are now cancelling this due to `` missing funds '' which is ridiculous . 
  i 'm currently paying 95 , - euro 's a month for road taxes alone for my car and 116 , - a year for my motorcycle ... just for owning them . 
  combined with 1,73 euro 's per liter of regular gas and 85 , - a month for car insurance ... absurd . 
  my mother , who lives in sweden , drives a heavy volvo station car and pays roughly 24 , - a month for road taxes and 30 , - for insurance . 
  fuck this country , really . 
  that 's such a load of bias . 
  you 'd have to be living under a rock to actually believe it . 
  if only , perhaps taxes would be done properly in some countries that require to be spoon fed . 
  true but it 's not so much about people that you 've known all your life . 
  even if it 's just a friend that you 've known for a little while that knows your personality that can vouch for you is enough . 
  i 've had job offers in both norway and sweden this way and apparently that is how it works . 
  sadly though , i have had to decline due to only knowing the very basics of the language . 
  once i speak swedish more fluently i shall make my way up north , 
  depending on what you plan on doing , know the laws from each country when it comes to camping . 
  here in the netherlands it 's illegal to camp , which is pretty ridiculous but sadly it 's true . 
  this is also most likely the best country to start in as it 's the most bicycle friendly country in the eu if not the entire world . 
  personally , i always take my motorcycle to sweden when i go . 
  i 'd start in the netherlands then germany , denmark , sweden followed by norway and then back here again . 
  or something like that . 
  there 's beautiful places to camp in all these places , even here in the netherlands but you 're only allowed to camp inside a park that 's designed for it . 
  just a tip , do n't take your motorcycle there as a 10 year old and start biking in the woods ... the big bad female officers will make you walk home with it . 
  from my own experience , it 's not so much the last name that does n't get you a job it 's not knowing people . 
  sweden is a very `` know who you are hiring '' kind-of country where it 's ** so ** much easier finding a job if you know just one guy that works where you are applying as opposed to not knowing anyone . 
  having several friends in sweden and having a german last name it 's actually quite easy getting a job but people are expecting you to learn the language and adapt which some groups are having trouble with . 
  not because they ca n't do it but because they refuse to . 
  it does n't matter what your last name is , your skin color or what country you are from ... knowing the language will get you extremely far . 
  i thought it was a good sub reddit until i noticed the amount of censorship . 
  i think it 's very well known there are certain groups of individuals that do n't belong in our european society but we 're too afraid to say it because we 're afraid to be labeled as racists which took a whole different turn since what happened in world war 2 . 
  i can find myself in that part about sweden . 
  my parents and i always went to a small cabin in malmo during the winter as a vacation because it was a great hunting area . 
  i saw that area change right before my very eyes . 
  once peaceful and beautiful , now one would swear you 've landed in baghdad itself ... such a shame . 
  personally , i 'm all for a three strike system depending on what crimes people commit . 
  once that third strike happens , they ought to be removed from our eu borders ( and those that become an eu member ) permanently without the chance of ever returning . 
  then again , maybe i 've spent a little bit too much time in afghanistan and it 's just me .
