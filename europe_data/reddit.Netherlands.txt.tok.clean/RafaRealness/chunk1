first off ile de france is already a region if france , there is no division like you claim there is do you know the difference between a region and a d\u00e9partement ? 
   france is disgustingly centralized , so cutting the center off will let the other parts live for once , without interference from paris so you 'd want to cut up france away from its central powers into smaller states then , cool . 
   third , it allows for better representation , the smaller the units the easier it is to govern and the closer the government has to be to the people how is putting for example austrians and and slovenes together better representation of them ? 
  they are just going to be polarized for christ 's sake . 
  if these nations were meaningfully mergeable as they share deep cultural ties then i would n't mind but just cutting up states for the sake of `` population homogeneity '' seems useless and inefficient to me . 
   fourth , the departments of france are already made without regard to culture , this would actually just bring the culture based division back . 
  tell that to normandie , br\u00e9tagne , corse , etc. . . most of which are now mixed along with `` west , east , north '' etc. . .  fifth , administrative divisions are not holy , they can and will be changed if it 's needed i agree with that , but i disagree with destroying france , germany , poland , spain , etc. . . for something that i have yet to hear a full explanation of : ** why do we want regions to have the same population and what happens in the long run when they no longer do ? 
  which brings up the question again : why are we dividing by population with no regards to cultural ties ? 
  and what happens if in the future one region becomes more populated than the others ? 
  do we just reshuffle everything around until we find balance again ? 
  and again , * what is the purpose of such a division * ? 
  these are not the d\u00e9partements though , these are just regions made up for the sake of naming some d\u00e9partements as north , south , central , etc. . . why should \u00cele-de-france become its own region , but none other can do so as well ? 
  and generate entirely artificial divides ? 
  what happens in the long run once a region has far more/less inhabitants ? 
  i do n't see the need for these new divides at all . 
  but why do you want to do away with nationalist elements and feelings ? 
  that for me sounds * anti * european if anything . 
  why not instead have a europe of cultures where we maintain the cultural regions themselves but make sense out of them , like for example portugal should be its own thing , basque country and catalonia as well , and germany can ( for the most part except bavaria and some other exceptions that may arise ) can remain the same . 
  post-nationalism here for me sounds like we 're just going through the blender and coming out as * just * european ... what the hell happened to `` in varietate concordia '' ? 
  that is * one * case though , it does not justify at all everything else . 
  why must the french be split up into teeny tiny states , but hungarians can retain their current one ? 
  beat me to it . 
  i do n't see why some states remain unitary by current borders ( hungary , portugal , bosnia & herzegovina , scotland ) and others are divided ... 
  so the directly elected parliament who voted in favor means nothing ? 
  what about the democratic national governments who ratified the treaty ? 
  for me , a multi-speed europe can screw over ascension of eastern member states towards other sectors of integration , for example this somewhat stops the eu 's pushes for romania and bulgaria to be admitted into schengen ( as they both have met requirements years ago ) but were vetoed by the netherlands and finland . 
  this is merely an example but a multi-speed europe could also mean that these countries will be a bit pushed behind * even if * they want to integrate more . 
  a multi-speed europe is a great idea in my opinion but it needs to be more carefully thought out and determined in its functioning to avoid precisely these types of cases where member states meet requirements for intra eu ascensions to more and more levels of integration , but are blocked . 
   but i 'd also be really , really sad to see romania just disappear . 
  romania would n't disappear , no member state would disappear at all . 
  most especially , consider that the european project and integration process has actually promoted safety nets for nations and that even though now it is easier to have blurred lines , we are still strong within our national identities . 
  romania is an idea , as well as a geopolitical entity , and should the eu ever federalize , romania would still exist and its people as well . 
  we are merging our political and economic interests , but we are still free to celebrate our own cultures and our diversity in the continent . 
   people have died for the right to self determination , for the concept of nation states . 
  people died for all sorts of causes , remember when romanian soldiers were willing to die for ceaucescu , and then one christmas that did n't materialize itself ? 
  self determination can also be unity , and not full division . 
  for example in 1990 , east germany seized to exist in favor of a united germany . 
  europe is a continent with * many * different states but we all have something in common : we 're all very small and not very powerful by ourselves , but together in our own common interests we are a strong beacon of innovation , production , political and economic influence . 
  we are n't going to destroy the romanian identity , or its culture , but instead celebrate it as part of the many cultures present in our continent , as well as celebrate romania as a part of our union , like for example france , or germany .

  i 'll be honest , that youtube channel is genuinely terrifying because that propaganda is very convincing , and its messages are genuinely quite evil and distorted ...  i build peace , i love peace ... by going to war and occupying foreign lands ? 
  this is some orwellian bullshit . . 
  does this work with baltic people ? 
  specially that part about going from radios and perfumes to toilets ? 
  of course !, 
  the more the merrier !, 
  you * really * underestimate how much it takes for a french person to * ever * say that the uk is `` quite alright '', 
  i feel quite hypocritical saying this after years in france but , sorry , dutch cheese wins in my books . 
  i used to only have 3g or edge/gprs wherever i was . 
  there were extremely awkward tiny spaces in the city with no coverage at all ( never know how/why , since they are just streets and everything around them has coverage ), 
  this seems like definitely a step forward , i remember living in \u00cele-de-france and my city ( not paris , but not really a tiny negligeable village ) had absolutely no 4g whatso ever ... 
  i 'll be honest that clip is * really * well made , like damn . 
  it 's bullshit in message since it definitely is just russian propaganda cranked to about 7/10 , but still the animation is very much on point . 
  * leerdammer cheese joined *, 
  marine lepen limited supplies !!!, 
  this is like a weird dolls collection at this point, 
  but i do n't think that the eu should grant * any * country outside the eu a special deal . 
  you 're inside the eu ( or the efta ) but otherwise you follow the same rules as any other country . 
  probably for the better too , from what i can remember , the real drama starts as soon as the elections are fully over and * then * it gets real shady real quick . 
  order up the popcorn . 
  but you know what 's even ... err * less better * than the afd ? 
  ** two afd , get your free afd today , quantities limited , black friday supersale **, 
  we still get to comment . 
  probably yeah , but in either case it 's not super bad , not their best one but still . 
  well do * you * want to have him then ? 
  it 's at 50 % discount !, 
  buy now , and recieve the whole pvv set !, 
  i can see it in both ways , and i like the idea itself , but in the grand scheme of things it 's granting uk citizens ( be it all or a few ) rights that eu citizens do not get from the uk . 
  for me it 's granting the uk access to privileges without any genuine reason , it 's bending to the uk 's will . 
  we should not grant special treatment for uk citizens in my opinion . 
  yes it is incredibly painful for the ones who voted to remain to now be told to get the boot , but if the eu concedes special benefits to the uk * outside * of the eu , well , then what 's the point on being inside the eu to begin with ? 
  * if * the uk allows eu citizens to have the same rights as previously , all uk citizens should also be granted the same exact rights as previously inside the eu , if not , it goes both ways . 
  for me it 's a two-way street though , why can uk citizens ( no matter now open-minded they are ) get to come to our countries , but we do n't get the same treatment ? 
  this undermines the eu significantly in my opinion , and although i truly wish this could be done , i believe that it would cause far more damage than it 's worth . 
  i 've visited the netherlands for the first time at 17 , and febo , two years later , still my favourite thing ever . 
  ** muh intensification **, 
  i do n't mind either but there 's a conflict for me : why do uk citizens get to come here , and we ca n't go into the uk in the same way ? 
  every time i hear that i just ask myself by reflex : * from who ? 
  is it just me or does this sound sorta ... 
  * sexy ? 
  from what i can say from this particular comment , i think we actually agree though ... 
  i think you misunderstand my intentions : when i joke about him , i do n't mean he 's * actually * that powerful , it 's just how ridiculous he is . 
  i do n't really care for him , although i still remain open to worry in the off-beat case he actually gets into power , in any other occasion , he 's just a character you make fun of with no real power , like kim kardashian for example . 
  i 'll still call him an extremist , because he is , but being an extremist does n't mean at all that he 's actually a danger , i could be an extremist against , let 's say , kfc , no matter how loud i shout at kfc to fuck off it 's not gon na happen , i 'm still an idiot * yelling at shit for it to go away * so let 's joke about how exactly wilders * is * ridiculous , and also focus on providing a better candidate . 
  yes , and you must also only do it in dutch , and also , if you 're hot , prostitution is mandatoy . 
  sole dutch foods shall exist !, 
  down with mcdonalds , long live febo !, 
  from what i 've heard a while back , they prepare these in advance , so maybe since they did n't know which way this was all gon na go , they decided to just do something that can go both ways . 
  in either case i thought it was funny . 
  hmm ... do you think maybe edrogan will take him in ? 
  to have a friend and stuff ... 
  dude , chill . 
  for me geert wilders is basically amputating your leg because you 've got a painful splinter . 
  yes there * are * problems that he addresses and proposes solutions but ... [ is this seriously what we want to fix our problems ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pfejai2is4 ) yes we need change , and yes we need to change * a lot * of political decisions , but wilders manages to take issues and purposefully aim them at islam and the eu , while purposefully lying about studies ... 
  i somewhat disagree with his trial on his speech on moroccans , because for me he did n't really say anything that is directly a hateful message like * kill all moroccans * but the context quite present there . 
  we need actual professionals , not just obsessive lunatics ; geert wilders is way too obsessed with how islam somehow is destroying europe to actually be a true , professional politician and address not the * islamisation of europe * but the * concerns of migration * which are two very different things . 
  well i 'm willing to give him to germany or austria ... 
  when do you guys want him delivered ?
