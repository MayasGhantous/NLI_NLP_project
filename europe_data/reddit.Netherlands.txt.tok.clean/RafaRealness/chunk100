  ... yes ? 
  that 's the same exact thing that happens in a * country * mind you . 
  in the netherlands a lot of resources and educated people move to noord and zuid holland , the east provinces are poorer , but we pay for them so that they can still live comfortably and have their jobs stay afloat . 
  i fail to see why this is a problem , it is basic economics . 
  hitler mussolini franco salazar leopold ii stalin thatcher vlad the impaler ivan the terrible p\u00e9tain i 'll add more if i think of any more . 
  ** no need to hide , little one , we 'll take great care of you **, 
  well , to be fair , foreign students * are * immigrants , however i do n't think all of them are migrant * workers * ( i imagine a lot do not hold a working permit ) . 
  i mean , yeah , they are immigrants but not * ta ` kin arr jaerbss *, 
  no * unless * there is a modification in eu policy : a refugee must * not * be allowed to reside and work outside of the country whom has processed their case and accepted them . 
  furthermore i believe that the eu should have no competence over migration law and refugee status should be accorded by * member state * and not be forced by the eu . 
  i would , however , agree to a distribution of * application quotas * , meaning that each country of the eu has to have an applications quota that must be processed according to their laws on asylum status . 
  only when this is achieved should we have better talks about quotas , otherwise you can take a good hard look at what 's happening in the baltics , portugal , slovenia , etc. . . and observe as the refugees that these countries have taken in actually * run off to wealthier states * . 
  this system can not work and thus needs to be resolved , otherwise by relocating refugees , you 'll only be creating needless havoc and paperwork to the receiving end . 
  so this system needs to be seriously thought over . 
  a tax to enter a market we created to * not * have taxes among us ? 
  seems legit . 
  eu funding is directed into developing the poorer parts of europe so they do not fall behind , this is done through a plethora of different programmes , such as the cohesion funds or the cap . 
  eastern europe is basically a huge chunk benefiting from these funds because merely it is not up to western standards . 
  eu funding for , say , poland , is * huge * as it is the biggest net receiver by far ; however there are also multiple violations of eu policy as well as constant scapegoating . 
  why should any funds be given to a country that is acting so volatile towards the eu ? 
  americans are fun to talk to in general , they are curious and happy , and i appreciate that . 
  they also produce a lot of things i love such as tv , music , android , etc. . . culturally i feel like american culture is so abundantly present that it comes off as grossly generic and uncreative . 
  it somewhat became so standard that it can not surprise nor awe me . 
  i can not stand ignorance that * some * americans have , as well as overly nationalistic tendencies that even creep me out . 
  i also dislike the rate of fat foods and guns all over the place , and the consumer-driven-ness of * everything * , it feels like it 's all about cash with little to no tact at times . 
  not to mention * no you are not a 14th german you were born and raised in michigan * i also * really * dislike america 's foreign policy in general , as i do its government and its functioning , but i do n't consider it directly the fault of americans as people ( i consider it their responsibility to take action though ) . 
  america is amazing , and it has at times a great history , amazing people , and can be genuinely awesome . 
  but it also has a lot of stains to its name ( perhaps more than most western countries ) and became so big that now just feels predictable ( culture-wise ), 
  your work visa allows you to work legitimately in * germany * , because you 've met * german * standards to obtain it . 
  you did not , however , meet * spanish * standards nor apply for any work authorization to work in spain . 
  you can , however , apply and i doubt it 'll be difficult to move to spain although be wary that in spain it is far more likely that employers will want to hire spanish/eu citizens rather than a 3rd country national . 
  that is true , though for me a combination of scapegoating the eu while also being the biggest net receiver * and * by far the biggest violator of eu regulations and directives has earned poland a special status . 
  in my opinion , yes . 
  poland is * by far * the country with the most convictions for not following eu regulations in far more fields than just refugees ( some dating back to even 2004 , mere months since they joined ) . 
  hungary also has quite a high number of convictions on similar basis . 
  these should not happen in any member state , however i think there should be a tolerance margin ( not as big as to support poland 's massive level but still ) . 
  this , plus the fact that both are controlled by politicians using eu funds ( being two * very * large net receivers of the eu , poland being the biggest ) while also scapegoating the eu with a lot of vague and inflammatory statements ( a practice done even * before * the refugee crisis ) , makes it clear for me : hungary and poland ( and any other member state fitting this criteria ) should have some rights revoked or have its membership frozen until there is a better government capable of criticizing the eu ( which i do n't mind when it 's factual ) but also admitting their own downfalls and cooperating to fix the problems , not just shout about them hipocritically . 
  i 'm not sure ( so correct me if i 'm wrong ) but was n't that dome stadium built for the olympics very expensive as well ? 
  i think it got demolished for being considered too ugly to stay . 
  if i remember correctly it was 2014 for my school . 
  i do n't want to kick anyone out , but i 'd love to withhold some eu benefits from some countries ( especially eu funding ) . 
  this mainly towards hungary and poland who keep blasting the eu for everything wrong in the world instead of taking initiative to solve it . 
  if we ca n't do that , then maybe * temporarily * suspend their eu membership until they come back to their senses and elect someone whose greatest fear is n't a nazi jew billionaire criminal mastermind ( soros ) . 
  i do n't really want anyone * permanently * out of the eu , i do n't think that 's really to anyone 's advantage here . 
   tape measure - how else would you define your side of the island ? 
  with a wall . 
  i 'd say a deep fryer , box of kroket/bitterballen ( from albert heijn specifically ) , and probably an orange hat . 
  very true , i was super happy back then . 
  to be honest if i found 15 $ today i 'd be just as happy too ... ahh the student life, 
  they did n't get rid of the computer rooms though , they instead put newer computers in it ( that sometimes were misconfigured and did n't work ) . 
  the teachers , who needed better computers to use the projectors with , did n't get diddly squat and had to work with the really old ones . 
  the admin was not fired , and was by far a moron on multiple accounts too . 
  it was a really bad implementation from start to finish , and an unwarranted one at that . 
  nobody really asked for laptops because we were n't really allowed to use them in class , and excuse me but why the fuck do * 11-12 year olds * need laptops and lockers for school , but other higher classes , who have far more books and need to a better computer do not ? 
  the idea was great , i must admit , provide students with the means to work more efficiently and more fluently with technology , prepare them for the future . 
  plus if the school had its own wifi , maybe we would n't need the computer rooms ( helas we barely had * any * internet ) . 
  the implementation was piss-poor and resulted in just needless costs . 
  i do n't really think we can , i 'm not really sure what meaningful cooperation can exist further than what currently already does between all these very different cities . 
  a history-focused programme for studies in the matter seems nice , but ultimately not very attractive nor very important . 
  ** vive paris ** ^ ( et ses colonies ), 
  in france they often went unused , and teachers who actively tried to use them tended to take quite a bit longer to get started , and also were disorganized and made pretty poorly made powerpoints . 
  part due to the * very * dated pcs my school had available ( having old versions of office on them that incorrectly displayed some newer files ) , part due to the unpreparedness of the teachers themselves ( seriously it was often painful and even by doing your very best to help you can not fix compatibility issues and odd setting choices you can not change without admin access ), 
  i looked up the costs , and you 're right , both were really damn expensive for what they were , especially jsf holy christ . 
  it 's also free for any eu/eez citizen . 
  the annual tuition fee ( the unavoidable one ) is a teeny tiny administration fee via apb that is always around just 200 $, 
  the definition of the assault can be anything from a smack to the back of the head to actual serious abuse though . 
  the article did not really show the definition at all , thus i do n't think that 6621 is a huge number for a population of over 45 million , who has thousands of arrests every single day , is severely alarming , especially considering that these are counting all of them since 2004 . 
  if it were 6621 in , say , estonia , who has a far lower population and also a lot lower incarcerated population and even lesser tourism , then yes it is a very high . 
  thus far we know that there are violations on the prison code , which generated 6621 cases that are not properly being investigated , correct ? 
  do we know how many of these would be considered serious offenses as the one in the article ? 
  or how many of these were fake accusations ? 
  it sounded like you were that girl from `` i 'm in me mum 's caaar '' when i read it in my head . 
  i wanted to call it out , because i honestly am still amazed as to how that happens . 
  i mean , the airport looks complete and modern , but * goddamn * a lot of corners were cut in safety . 
  do n't really think it 's silly . 
  if that 's what makes you happy and that 's what you want , go right ahead . 
  i do n't really see anything wrong with it . 
  just a little bit of banter . 
  i ca n't think of any big waste by the dutch government , but i remember that when i was in france , there was a decision to install projectors in every classroom , and * my god * it was the most useless thing ever . 
  they also decided to give laptops to students in 6\u00e9me ( 11-12 year olds ) . 
  those struck me as huge useless wastage that generated more problems than it solved . 
  probably belgium / s, 
  that is valid for any and all member states though , furthermore consider that a * lot * of these claims tend to be entirely ficticious . 
  some are definitely true , but 6621 is not really an alarming number considering that spain not only has 46\u00a0560\u00a0000 people residing in it , as well as a higher dosage of tourism in some parts of it . 
  these all are bound to generate entirely made up or unreasonable accusations against police forces out of spite or as an attempt to score some ( an unfortunate practice ) . 
  i * do * however agree that in the cases your article showed * had * a lot of evidence that were not properly investigated and trialed , which is unfortunate and alarming for any country and also reveals a deficiency on the part of the spanish government . 
  the real deficiency is not lack of investigation , the real deficiency is poorly managed and poorly designed resource allocation system to provide these cases that are abundant in evidence and urgency the proper investigation they deserve . 
  yes , sorry , i thought i included it but definitely bruges . 
  antwerp , zeeland ( if you like peaceful boring nature ) , amsterdam , rotterdam , li\u00e8ge , luxembourg city , maastricht , utrecht , ghent , ( edit ) bruges , etc. . . 
  the benelux is full of beautiful places , it entirely depends on what you 'd like to see . 
  rotterdam is amazing for its modern skyscrapers and colorful city lights , whereas zeeland is awesome for its calm , natural , and cozy characteristics . 
  have fun exploring it !, 
  well * sorta * . 
  the eu requires all member states to comply with the charter of human rights . 
  this includes the uk . 
  however , very easily , the uk can just revoke it , as well as the european convention on human rights . 
  but if you travel to , for example , lyon to frankfurt , the same documents are checked . 
  you must show your id and ticket . 
  that 's it . 
  between an entirely isolated uk/eu relationship and an efta membership agreement , what would you prefer ?
