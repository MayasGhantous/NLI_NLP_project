  a hard brexit is worse for everyone involved * including * the eu as it will lose contributions ( efta members are required to pay into the eu budget as well ) and also lose a lot of access to certain markets that can definitely affect its own member states . 
  france makes a tonne of money with airbus , a worldwide famous brand of aircrafts ; thing is they nearly always use rolls royce engines which are british . 
  this is just one small example in a sea of cases where both sides will be severely affected by going back to wto rules . 
  what makes you think that the eu will not agree with a norway-like arrangement ? 
  the efta is quite open still . 
   what does brexit have to do with human rights ? 
  ms may went full-retard and now wants to go against human rights , especially privacy . 
  however , i have * no * clue what schengen could change ... 
  you ca n't walk through that tunnel , it 's a train that passes through there so unless you want to kill yourself in a goresome way i highly recommend you do n't . 
  border checks are performed in france ( if you are going to the uk ) and the uk ( if you are going to france ) . 
  this is a pretty good and safe arrangement that does n't pester anyone , plus i do n't really get more checked crossing the channel than i do while crossing belgium . 
   but our money is so preeeeeeetty . 
  * eh , the queen 's a 6 to be honest * ** / s **, 
  ... why would the uk , who firmly is against schengen and is for the most part * islands * want to join schengen ? 
  they have * one * land border and that 's with the republic of ireland , plus they have no borders there as part of the cta . 
  there is no solution of any territorial problems by joining schengen , and what the hell does schengen have to do with human rights ? 
  joining schengen for the uk is useless , especially now that they are on their way out . 
  i know , but consider a risqu\u00e9 damage control strategy where you make brexit so horribly mismanaged that british voters start to want a * softer * brexit instead . 
  it may be easier to sell them that once a harder brexit goes tits up . 
  if it was soft brexit from the get-go , there would be tonnes of disappointed british voters who would still prefer a harder one . 
  i genuinely was very interested in both . 
  but the problem was not at all the work itself , it was the incredibly poor management . 
  my mom worked in two supermarkets too in france ( franprix and lidl ) and both had the same exact problems mine did ( monoprix ) including entirely untrained staff having to handle machinery for moving heavy product stacks , unpaid overtime * multiple * times ( we had to go to court even ) , constant changes in shifts last-minute , extremely unresponsive and incompetent superiors ( once expecting me to clean * all * windows from the frozen goods section in * less than 5 minutes * ) etc. . . 
  i firstly thought it genuinely was going to be a great experience , and in a way i learned a lot about how a supermarket works and such . 
  however , that was entirely overshadowed by the revoltingly bad staff that lingers in them . 
  d'aww thanks !, 
  plot twist though : i 'm actually half portuguese half french , i just moved to the netherlands ( permanently ) a while back . 
  my first one in a supermarket was mandatory in school , yes . 
  it 's the same as you just described . 
  i did two internships in france . 
  one in a driving school and one in a supermarket . 
  ** i hated them so much they became a huge drive for me to do well in school **, 
  i think he put it in a good way to illustrate it . 
  that 's of course , my personal opinion , and i respect yours too . 
  that 's all fine and good but i do n't think there 's any need to be necessarily * polite * . 
  i would have probably answered it in a similar fashion . 
  honesty and politeness do not always go hand in hand . 
  and the fact that no austrian/german complained about his statement perhaps indicates that what he says is accurate . 
  true , though i think it 's good to add that some municipalities offer dutch classes for immigrants , and it is * very * much worth your while in my opinion , if you count on permanently living in the netherlands . 
  it 's possible that you can get a job that does n't require you to speak dutch at first , and then at the same time learn the language to then look for a better employment . 
  in the netherlands it 's pretty straightforward : no holocaust denial , and no actual calls for discrimination/hatred based on race , ethnicity , religion , etc. . . 
  there was an interesting case recently with one of our politicians ( geert wilders ) who got trialed on such charges . 
  so you 're saying you did n't have anything to say then ? 
  what exactly was that about `` leaving it to the concerned parties '' , or about the original answer 's op wanting to send a message ? 
  i 'm here and i 'll probably stick around , you wo n't miss me i assure you . 
  as for wasting everyone 's time , i must be very damn interesting to read if i can force * everyone * to take time to acknowledge me . 
  the points you made did not stick in the least , you were called out on them by multiple users and even had some of your comments removed , probably for personal attacks . 
  consider your standing more closely and perhaps you 'll understand that * perhaps * you need to reconsider some of your previous analogies . 
  i initially said that you , an *** american *** in a *** european *** subreddit were telling a *** european *** not to answer a question in such fashion . 
  you also implied that he , a *** european *** in *** r/askeurope *** was not a concerned party . 
  it takes talent for anyone to make it even more obvious so you can understand , but i 'm willing to keep giving it a try . 
   wikipedia usually covers , you know , facts . 
  he 's asking about feelings . 
  it 's like you 're going out of your way to find something to charge him with . 
  i 'm not really going out of my way to do anything . 
  if you would have taken the time to even * google * this you 'd find tonnes of resources for understanding the difference between austrian and german identities , yet no such effort was made . 
  i can also recommend a damn good book that explains the intricate relations about it but obviously asking a dumb and badly formulated question was clearly the easy way out . 
   i can manage my time . 
  it 's just annoying to be peppered with questions you 've already answered . 
  is it not ? 
  do you not agree ? 
  surely you would had you not dug yourself in . 
  if you already answered then why is it that you do n't limit yourself to a mere copy-paste ? 
  or better yet , just ignoring me ? 
  i do n't mind annoying you , do n't worry , and as for digging myself in . 
  you on the other hand , have yet to provide an actual argument against the * most topvoted answer in this thread * and also got some of your comments removed . 
  i would n't call that a success . 
   an ill-informed question . 
  cogitate on that phrase for a minute . 
  wikipedia , google , deutsche welle ... * so many sources * to merely do a * hint * of research and be provided with fruitful resources to understand it all gone to waste . 
  dumb questions are dumb questions when you have access to the information yourself . 
  i do n't ask r/askeurope why the hell yugoslavia went to shit , i merely googled it and bam , full wikipedia page on it . 
  not to mention that it also was formulated in such a way that can even subjugate austrian culture and identity to merely being perpetually `` german but not '' . 
  i would not find it very respectful to be asked such a question about my nationality . 
   truthfully , i 'm more concerned with you wasting my time than your own . 
  luckily i do n't care for neither in the least . 
  i assume you 're grown enough to take care of your own time , and that may include logging off . 
  do what you will . 
  near perfect . 
  i love our current arrangement , just need to stop giving seats to incompetent parties like denk and the pvv ; maybe also make senior and student healthcare a little bit better but eh , it 's not a bad situation at all . 
  with everything else i 'm pretty happy and damn grateful i get to live here . 
   i think you missed the precise meaning of that phrase , or are trying too hard to throw it back at me . 
  if i were throwing anything , trust me that i 'd be far more clear . 
   i address that further down . 
  you could 've saved yourself some typing by simply reading more of the thread . 
  * oh no the 14 seconds of my free time it took to post this how ever shall i recover !? 
  * let me make my point painfully clear to you : this question was very badly formulated and ill-informed , and thus a bad question deserves an accurate but bad answer . 
  you have called him out on `` relevant parties '' not including him , but they include him as a european in r/askeurope far more than they include your opinion on how good his answer was on the matter . 
  so again , why are * you * out of all people to judge him ? 
  do you know his ancestry ? 
  his experience with either german or austrian culture ? 
  you do not . 
  you are an * american * who came to a * european subreddit * and bitched about a * european * not being a concerned party . 
  ** does this not strike you as odd in any way , shape , or form ? 
  ** if this question is only to german-speakers , then it should have been posted in r/de yet was n't . 
  thus any and all europeans in this subreddit are the main concerned party . 
  from what i can tell , he * did * answer the question . 
  and i 'd probably answer it the same way considering how condescending and ill-informed the question itself is . 
  if he wanted to send a message then it 's clear : * stop asking dumb questions and think two minutes before posting * . 
   wovon man nicht sprechen kann , dar\u00fcber muss man schweigen take your own advice next time then , this was a question posted in r/askeurope which is a subreddit for europeans to answer questions .
