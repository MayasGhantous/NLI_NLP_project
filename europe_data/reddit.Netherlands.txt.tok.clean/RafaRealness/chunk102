  this is exactly what he did . 
  on the other hand you are not a european and merely disagreed with his opinion and hipocritically called him out on `` not being a relevant party '' even though for all we know he can be german/austrian . 
   what are you doing ? 
  he 's answering the question . 
  if you can not take such answers perhaps you should not read a thread on a very dumb question . 
  not in my lyc\u00e9e , i had to switch to oib classes because the standard french history classes were biased as hell . 
  look at the way napoleon is taught , and the way the algerian war is often glossed over . 
  i 'm a ** [ macho macho man ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao43p2wqc08 ) **, 
  i do n't know about most of europe , but i certainly was taught quite a bit about ww2 in asia , including the japanese atrocities and whatnot . 
  ** in west yugoslavia born and raised ** ** zaghreb , in hrvatska was where i spent most of my days ** ** workin ' , maxin ' , relaxin ' all cool ** ** and all eating some sarma outside the school ** ** when a couple of guys who were up to no good ** please someone make this a thing, 
  i speak european portuguese often on the phone ( muh parents ) i 've been mistaken in france for a turk , an israeli , a czech , a slovak , a ukrainian , a slovene , and a croat . 
  in the netherlands , i 'm usually mistaken for a turk , an indonesian ( i have yet to understand why/how ) , a ukrainian , a spaniard , an italian , and a general south american . 
  portugal : - okay we were * huge * dicks to jews historically , let 's never do that shit ever again . 
  ( bonus : a bunch moved to the netherlands ) france : - well , we had vichy ... but was it * reeeaaallly * france ? 
  plus we totes did n't cooperate or anything ( just a little biiiit ) . 
  my view of jews today is basically just normal people who have a different religion , and also have pretty nice food . 
  they do n't really stand out to me , they just strike me as normal dutch/french/etc ... people whilst them being jewish does n't really mean much to me besides `` maybe i should ask them what they can and can not eat , just in case '', 
  all used to be part of the ussr . 
  armenia hates azerbaijan and turkey , has a nice language . 
  very christian i think ? 
  azerbaijan loves turkey and hates armenia , has an armenian region inside them that wants independence or to rejoin armenia . 
  also has its own exclave that is divided by armenia . 
  kind of a bitch to travel through . 
  muslim and speaks a language very close to turkish . 
  built a whole damn stadium for eurovision once . 
  georgia is having issues with south ossetia and abkhazia , also christian ? 
  has a really odd but cool alphabet . 
  i have no damn clue what the goddamn hell is going on up in there . 
  i remember finding like 3,000 $ ( portuguese escudo ) in 2001 as a kid . 
  it was worth just short of 15 $, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iihrsbamwu ) culturally they are not what i consider european , geographically we 'd have a goddamn border with syria , iraq , armenia , etc. . . 
  they still politically are not at all ready for such a thing ( northern cyprus comes to mind , so does the armenian genocide question ) . 
  and now : ** tayyip erdogan **, 
  [ basically a spooky kooky illuminati sorta thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freemasonry ) i remember hearing those christians saying that , and i kinda laughed about it . 
  canada was the second country worldwide to do that shit . 
  i 'm pretty sure what i said was a joke , but if you want to be offended , i do n't really mind . 
  the capital of the netherlands is amsterdam . 
  we have the consulates in amsterdam , and the embassies in the hague . 
  logic . 
  [ eh pourtant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vichy_france ), 
  my pleasure , enjoy !, 
  yeah , but at least they had their own tv show , and also a cookbook !, 
  there were near celebs in denmark . 
  oh god i forgot about them . 
  i remember that in 2013 , when gay marriage was made legal in france ( horray ! ), 
  i saw a tonne of ( seemingly uneducated ) muslims going fully rampant about it saying it was either the jews or the franc-ma\u00e7ons ( no joke ) . 
  *** it 's not called theory if it 's true , my little dear zuid brabant < 3 ***, 
  they are n't really a joke party and they have a programme that can be taken seriously . 
  i mean , i do n't like them in the least , but they are very much a party . 
  we also have denk that might as well be a sad joke , or the pvv , as both have a far less plausible programme and are usually the source of amazingly bad statements . 
  do n't bother they 're gone . 
  trump called them back ( aka rufus is not an ambassador any longer ) and his position is now taken by laura lochman . 
  i 'd like a fair deal between the eu and the uk . 
  for me this means that the uk * must * pay for the projects it has agreed to pay for already ( the `` exit bill '' as it 's called ) . 
  it 's been pretty obvious that the uk will * not * be okay with being a part of the internal market because that requires abiding by eu regulations and accepting freedom of movement of eu citizens . 
  thus an eea option does not seem plausible and i do not want the eu to give the uk any special treatment in regards to avoiding some of the freedoms of the internal market . 
  free trade seems the way to go , as well as very open visa policies and solutions to citizens on both sides . 
  i believe this will be possible , provided that both sides are mature enough to fully negotiate calmly and reasonably . 
  i believe that britain must stop having any say in any eu policy . 
  norway , who is in the efta , does not , so why should britain who is likely to be a 3rd country to the union ? 
  it makes no logical sense that a post-brexit britain would guard its say in the eu whilst being outside of it . 
  should there be cases where only one can truly benefit , i will stand by the eu as i believe that the eu , as the bigger and stronger of the two , should by default benefit the most . 
  the uk can have a fair deal but only to the point that the eu agrees with it and benefits sufficiently from it . 
  also , let me be very damn clear : ** please for all that is sacred let 's make sure that ireland is not fucked in the process and that also goes for northern ireland **, 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  * and * he 's gay * dreams do come true *, 
  stay strong yo !, 
  basically i think it 's gon na be very popcorn worthy . 
  i do n't like it but i kinda ca n't wait to see where it goes . 
  czechia sounds better to me , it 's more country-like and in essays about it there * is * a distinction between czechia and the czech republic itself ( government vs country distinction basically ) . 
  you know when you 're watching a really good goddamn roast section and someone really cuts deep and you are all like ** ooooooshiiiit it 's about to pop off odaaaamn ** that . 
  i have found quite a few near-nudes from him . 
  pubic area and up basically . 
   rufus gifford 's husband * [ oh my god i need a pregnancy test yeeeesss ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b0ncgwhciaa6p3a.jpg ) *, 
  * hey baby , i might be portuguese but i still cook a mad hot paella ~ *, 
   diversity lottery slots are allotted on a per country basis . 
  if you participate you will only compete against other people of your nationality . 
  do i have more or less chances based on the country 's population then ? 
  there 's a tonne of russians so am i less likely to get it * just because * my country 's population is bigger and thus there are likely more participants ? 
  or do bigger countries get a bigger share of the winning individuals ? 
   it 's not blind luck . 
  once you won you will be invited for an interview . 
  they 'll ask you why they should give you a green card . 
  they 'll ask you why they should believe that you wo n't be a burden on the public . 
  this does not mean that you are the best among those who participated though , and yes this filter is nice but * you need to win to get there * . 
  if you do not win the lottery you do n't get an interview and thus you will need an alternate visa scheme to go to the us . 
   and if they do n't like your answers you 'll be dropped like a hot potato . 
  good , at least that 's sorted out . 
   btw , we 're talking about 50,000 dv lottery slots per year . 
  for comparison : 846,000 eu citizens moved to germany in 2015 . 
  yes , i 'm aware , though i believe that if the us wants more diversity then a points-based system like australia 's would be more appropriate ( think about it , turn the lottery into a contest , the ones from a country the us wants to attract more participate and the most attractive potential immigrants get through into the interview process ) . 
  oh , ya know , i 'm doing just fine , * now that you 're here * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i definitely have a hard on for the far north guys . 
  finnish dudes makes me * happy * . 
  and also northeast asians ( korea , most of china , japan ... ) are also hella cute . 
  watch new kids turbo and nitro for reference . 
  that 's basically it / s, 
  anywhere with me in it . 
  i would rather live in country a , because i believe that there are very basic regulations that i 'd probably die without . 
  i would n't live a very happy life , but choosing country b is basically choosing what for me seems like a fallout game scenario and it would probably mean my premature death .
