  i encourage every country to either legalize it but highly regulate it , or take the dutch stance of just * tolerate * it . 
  surprisingly more often it 's 20 year old something german fratboys . 
  i do not know why nor how but 20 year old tourists by far are the ones who can handle their liquor/drugs the least , especially in public ( i 've seen unspeakable things ), 
  no , portuguese , i think it 's just the portuguese version of eva , and i find it to be an amazing name , i love it . 
  ... yes ? 
  if you want to pay me fares be my guest . 
  why of course !, 
  and let 's not forget the entirety of foreigners that just * love * cycling outside the lanes and onto the sidewalks and roads , or even ride * really slowly * just to enjoy the views !, 
  ** there is absolutely nothing fucking better than uninformed tourists **, 
  eeevo and eeeeeva . 
  depends on the language i am speaking to them i guess , my parents always pronounced my name differently depending on what language we were speaking . 
  ivo ( if it 's a boy ) or eva ( if it 's a girl ) . 
  i love both names , they are very simple and beautiful in my opinion . 
  oh man , is n't our weed tourism just the * best * ? 
  filling up the street with tourists who ca n't handle their drugs . 
  ** this is all assuming turkish gay and atheists are considered in such a danger that they genuinely need asylum : ** yes , under the strict condition they do not abandon the country they were granted asylum in to go to richer states like germany , and they fully assimilate with their host country 's social conduct and cultural values , * and * they do n't just live off from welfare . 
  i care very little for religion and sexuality , but i care a great deal about our country 's lifestyles being respected and followed . 
  maybe croatia is just ... croatia . 
  if you do n't fit , ~ ~ use more lube ~ ~ just be yourselves . 
  no , we need to ensure we have * legislative competences and responsabilities * attributed to entities that will complete the goals . 
  you , on the other hand , believe that we can just write rules and roll with it for years , yet you ignore that it is merely not the case since a thing called the * industrial revolution * . 
  we need the commission * or an alternative * that will perform the powers it has over the common market , otherwise the common market will very likely seize to exist . 
  take a look at the van gend en loos case , apply that to every member state , and then also apply the simmerthal case , and also the dassonville case , and the cassis de dijon case , etc. . . all legal cases of national legislation going against eu legislation and performing anti-common market practices . 
  if you allow this you will effectively make the common market collapse faster than a deck of cards in the middle of a tornado . 
  you * need * legislative control , right now that power lies with the commission which has been keeping the common market together , so if you want to dissolve the commission , you must propose an alternative for its legislative power . 
  so for the ** 5th time ** : who , if not the commission , will have legislative power ? 
  * we do n't even have enough regulatory methodology right now what makes you think we could run a common market with no legislative authority ? 
  * seriously , we need new legislation all the time just like a * country * would in that regard . 
  you might not notice it but both the polish government and the european commission are constantly pushing new legislation in order to ensure a fair market functioning , otherwise it 'll all go tits up * very * fast . 
  right now we do not even have enough regulations to make the services sector work fully seamlessly , so again what the hell ? 
  do we just give up and let our dated market regulations destroy the construction that took decades so far ? 
  also , you wanted , and i quote :  a federation of sovereign nations with free trade which is entirely stupid , because you can not be simultaneously fully sovereign and based on free-trade , a common market ** and also a federation ** the three are very different things . 
  and ** again ** you fail to answer ** who has legislative power in your case **, 
  ... which all do not function like a common market at all . 
  trade deals are often * very * much restricted and take a dualist approach to law implementation , so it is extremely easy to extort and even to end such a deal on a whim . 
  not to mention that it is also less beneficial since it revokes all cohesion funds and can be extremely restricting to the free movement of * anything * because free trade is * not * a common market at all . 
  an * actual * common market needs regulation , and regulation comes from legislative , executive , and juridical power . 
  you propose to dissolve the commission which is the legislative power of the eu ( thus we ca n't write any new legislation ) , and the parliament ( thus we can no longer voice our opinion and vote for/against propositions ) and all you have left is the european court of justice ... 
  the common market needs legislative power , otherwise it seizes to exist . 
  so ** again ** : who has legislative power in your case ? 
  but there can be * no * common market without legislative power , otherwise countries can ( and will ) start heavily abusing stuff like custom duties or quantitative restrictions again and before you know it there 's nothing left . 
  if you want * free trade * that 's another thing , but it severely undermines or also entirely ignores eu citizen rights , such as living in other countries with the same access as social services as nationals . 
  the eu * needs * legislation in order to work , and you are claiming that you want to entirely abolish the entity who literally does that without replacing it ... again , ** who ** would be in charge of eu-wide legislation ? 
  but if not the commission , who will be responsible for the legislative competences and responsabilities of the eu ? 
  there can be no federal nor confederal entity at all without a legislative power ... 
  remind yourself that the ecsc itself had the high authority which was * far * less democratic than the commission , and the eec was n't faring much better either . 
  i agree that there are definitely problems but firstly there are not that many of them ( there are literally more people working for the municipality of amsterdam than there are working for the eu ) and a lot of these buildings were already being built for other purposes . 
  that does not , however , mean that they are cost efficient ( they are not and abolishing the 1-member-per-state rule is a good first step ) . 
  i kinda look at croatia the same way i do to slovenia and czechia you 're not full-east but not really west , you 're somewhere in the middle : * central *, 
  portugal 's ( they are already the oldest ones in europe ` ayyy ), 
  so ... what do you propose instead ? 
  who would be responsible of upholding eu law and creating legislation at eu level ? 
  no more non-contributor new states ( meaning that only states that will be net contributors should be allowed in for now ) , no influence over language nor culture ( already a thing , let 's keep the eu 's place out of there mor the majority of this ) . 
  i have a huge list of things i do n't want the union to do nor have control over right now , but i do n't think there 's a lot ( that is n't extreme ) that would actually make me want to disband the union . 
  that depends on what you believe the commissioners should reflect : the people ( in which case they could be directly elected regardless of state and serve the union in general ) or the governments ( in which case each government would need to be treated equally under valid criteria ), 
  blessed be that movie . 
   berlin airport ** pahahahaahahahaahaha **, 
  i would under the condition that the new system does * not * at all give an advantage to the bigger nations . 
  all member states , from malta to germany , must have their say equally without exception . 
  yeah , i sorta get that when i talk to people that are around 14 or 15 and they do n't remember video cassettes at all . 
  like , * bitch how ? 
  well , i dunno , compared to portugal and france it 's true that dutch people tend to be way stingier in my opinion . 
  i personally like it , i pay what i owe and not a penny more if i do n't want to . 
  it makes me feel more normal , hehe . 
  french/english/portuguese-fluently ( native languages + * english * c'mon ) spanish/italian-high level but you can certainly tell it 's not my language dutch-eh , still getting there , can have basic conversations and understand basic tv shows and whatnot russian/german-studying , have no idea what the fuck is going on . 
  i agree with you but i do n't really remember 56k modems altogether . 
  technology for me has yet to give me a `` wow '' moment since i feel like smartphones and such have been there for my most meaningful memories . 
  politically , what i * do * remember is the euro crisis and so on . 
  i think that technology will be beyond me eventually , and i already am starting to see new trends appear like curved screens or ultra widescreen panorama monitors or smarttvs that genuinely are being more and more amazing to me since they are beyond what i can remember and what i 'm used to . 
  i think that as well , * but * i still keep an open mind about it . 
  i do n't think it 'll happen but i do n't deny the possibility . 
  i 'm only 20 , so most of it went straight past me , i feel like not a lot has happened yet . 
  i do n't remember at all 9/11 , so for me the real history that i feel like i genuinely knew and lived was starting from about 2007 onwards . 
  i 'm pretty happy with living right now . 
  things seem better than they were before , and slowly but surely progress is taking place . 
  i 'd obviously would love to have seen some historic events myself , or maybe know what the future holds , but i 'm pretty happy regardless . 
  i 'll try to find some , because i 'm curious to see how the polish courts apply the law . 
  ** shhhhh !!, 
  ** * none must know yet *, 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm studying law right now though i 'm really unsure of the echr ( and the charter too ) and its direct application . 
  i loved reading about this case because i found it * mega * interesting as to how exactly the law applies here . 
  i think that it all boils down severely to `` what did he mean by it ? '', 
  in order to have a trial but the opinion swings ( and even i 'm unsure considering how little sense the man makes to me ) . 
   if a class has min 3 roma children then the class size is max 21 . 
  ... what ? 
  why ? 
  and also the scary anything-related-to-it . 
  i remember this gag that happened near my house where he started talking about `` that mosque down the street '' ( it was an ugly building with odd windows i 'll grant him that ) and as it turns out that place is a * school * . 
  i swear this man ... plus , the fuck was he doing in zuidoost ? 
  it 's * known * for being full of foreign people but mainly from surinam or the caribbeans , not mena . 
  we 'll just take over that thing everyone likes to call `` belgium '' if need be, 
  is there * any * case of law for art . 
  not to him apparently , considering how he hates anything to do with arabic and pashto , yet defends their equivalents in hebrew ( tradition-wise ) . 
  i agree with you on that but in the case of the netherlands the situation is more delicate . 
  moroccan immigrants have their children within the netherlands which makes them dutch citizens , however some of them do * not * follow dutch customs nor society , and instead regress into these tiny isolated moroccan communities that do not integrate . 
  as a result , many of these people later become criminals ( hence a huge overrepresentation of moroccans in convictions in the netherlands ) . 
  this thus generates the debate : what do we do ? 
  it 's not as if we can strip them off their citizenship and send them anywhere ; but our integration mechanism is not working as they are not assimilating . 
  when geert wilders started this whole thing about `` less moroccans ! '',
