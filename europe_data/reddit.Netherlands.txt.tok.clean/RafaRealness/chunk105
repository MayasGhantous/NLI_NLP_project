  it was unclear if he was referring to the ones holding moroccan citizenship ( foreigners ) or the * ethnic * moroccans born in the netherlands ( * not * foreigners but not far from it ) . 
  what did he mean by `` less moroccans '' ? 
  was he really talking about immigration , or something more sinister that would more closely match his other promises ( like banning the qu ` ran ) ? 
  i checked the greek law , and you 're right , there does n't seem to be any law that actually could be fully applied to him in this instance as directly . 
  * although * it also depends if you consider this speech as a call for violence or not ( which some of his followers did and followed suit ), 
  was he trialed at all ? 
  but in 1999 portugal passed a law prohibiting discriminatory practices based on ( among others ) nationality and ethnic origin ( which depending on how you understand `` moroccan '' can mean one of both ) . 
  furthermore , there has been debate here in the netherlands if he genuinely was ( or not ) trying to incite violence since he did not specify at all that this was about migration , and he merely said `` we 'll do so then ! '', 
  which was followed by a noticeable rise on crime against moroccans and other ethnic minorities . 
  if he would have stated * what * he 'd do we would not at all have had a shitfest about it for weeks , but precisely he left it up for more interpretation to get a reaction , furthering his media coverage for political aspirations . 
  i 'm not * very * worried because i believe that the usa has no interest in entirely destroying us . 
  we are business partners and have ( despite trump ) still good relationships . 
  if nato truly is seeing its last few days , i believe that the eu could , and should form its own replacement with all ( willing ) member states . 
  right now the usa is going through a 4-year shitfest , but once it is over , we likely will get someone * far * better apt to have a diplomatic dialogue with than trump ( and pence ) . 
  i do n't think the answer for poland is that obvious . 
  the polish constitution by art . 
  13 opposes any type of speech that entices racial or national hatred . 
  technically there could be a debate on if geert wilders did this or not , plus under art . 
  35 , there are provisions to protect ethnic and religious minorities in poland . 
  obviously the context is * radically * different since poland and the netherlands are two very different countries with different ideas and different relationships with moroccan immigrants . 
  perhaps this debate can be just as divisive as it 's been in the netherlands ( very 50/50 opinions on it ), 
  yep , very true . 
  i think that this is his strategy , to make sure to be super controversial , so that there * is * a generated reaction to what he 's doing so he can victimize himself . 
  that 's , in my opinion , how he got so popular , constant `` oh look at us we 're the victims against the establishment ! '', 
  narratives . 
  i think french is beautiful to be honest , and french is not at all the sole one doing this . 
  spanish , portuguese , and italian all do so as well !, 
  geert wilders , the leader of the pvv ( partij voor de vrijheid ) in the netherlands . 
  a one-man party with extremely eurosceptic ideas and whose entire party pledge is very random and xenophobic stuff that is even anticonstitutional like `` ban the qu ` ran ! '', 
  in the last general elections this year , the pvv scored 13.1 % of the vote , being the 2nd biggest party . 
  however he ca n't really lead because he is so extremist and odd ( even questionably illegal as a party itself due to being a one-man party ) ; which in turn makes a coalition with him merely impossible ; and thus he 's always the opposition . 
  more choice in terms of goods and services . 
  do n't like your national choice ? 
  few minutes down the road you 'll get your neighbor 's selection . 
  lots of people living near the borders of the netherlands prefer shopping in germany and belgium because it 's cheaper ( although sometimes in belgium they are a bit the same prices in cases like baarle-nassau/hertog ), 
  nope , he 's israel 's bff , most likely because israel hates its neighbors and geert wilders just hates anyone who uses a scary alphabet . 
   not really . 
  the vvd youth wing is very popular , visible and vocal here in groningen at least . 
   it obviously differs from faculty to faculty . 
  we were talking about groningen , you suddenly said `` from faculty to faculty '' which thus makes no coherence if you are referring directly to the last previous sentence whose subject was * groningen * which is a province/city and * not * a university . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with your point , but you definitely missed the mark there . 
  * oh baby keep talking like that to me *, 
  goddamn , fritattensuppe looks really good . 
  basically he was all up `` do we want more or less moroccans ! '', 
  and obviously his brainwashed voters just shouted `` less !, 
  less !, 
  less ! '', 
  this * can * be viewed as an attempt to entice violence against moroccans themselves ( since you are talking to the masses with sensationalist bullshit to create a very convenient attackable enemy ) . 
  however this * also * can be a debate point for the elections just misformed in wording : should we start limiting migrants from mena more or not ? 
  ( moroccans being considered the most problematic minority here in nl ) soooo the whole trial caused tonnes of debate . 
  oh man , that was a * huge * shitfest here . 
  yes , make 3 times as much . 
  and eat 3 times as much . 
  not according to your previous comment where groningen = faculty . 
  chicken noodle soup y' all, 
  ... that does not make it a faculty . 
  a faculty is * part * of a university , like in the uva we have the faculty of humanities and the faculty of sciences . 
  groningen has the uvg ( assuming that 's the one you mean ) which has 9 faculties and a university college . 
  if you take a look at what these faculties are , and if you find statistics ( i did n't find any , sorry ) i think you * can * argue that different faculties within universities have different tendencies , but groningen is n't a faculty in the least . 
  disgusted . 
  he 's still `` deciding '' about it but it is extremely clear he 'd pollute the everlasting fuck out of the earth if he could make an extra 10 $ for it . 
  nothing 's changed to be fair . 
  * before * you get to your bachelor 's level you can have a few difficulties . 
  a bachelor 's , master 's and phd is valid by law in all of the eu fairly equally . 
  i had to prove i spoke english , even though i did the option internationale au baccalaur\u00e9at in uk english ( meaning i not only speak it perfectly well , i also can analyze literature ) . 
  i needed to spend an extra 200 $ to pass a craptastic test to have actual proof i speak it . 
  they also once asked me to prove i speak french because apparently * completing high school in france was not enough * but after some colorful conversations the point got across . 
  i 've heard that some others had to prove other oddities like that because of options that exist in some countries , but do not in others . 
  for the most part , i personally never saw any big difficulties . 
  ... the stingy part is pretty accurate in my experience . 
  though i like it since nobody calls me stingy anymore , i 'm just normal . 
  yes . 
  i was a portuguese citizen living in france , non-religious , spoke perfect french , no problems at all . 
  my mom was even * born * in france but lost citizenship and is just portuguese . 
  we called the police * multiple times * over our neighbor threatening to beat us up , and also leaving trash right on our doorstep , even heavy construction materials that left a lot of damages . 
  the police never came for 3 years saying it was n't `` reason enough '' ... they were a 5 minute walk away and still would not come . 
  it was not until the day that my neighbor actually tried to beat my mom , and that my uncle saw , and that i saw , and that it was on the street , that they actually cared . 
  ** did n't really matter before **, 
  * ca n't let you belgians beat us at anything !, 
  *** worth it ***, 
  well , how about that one time belgium did n't actually have a government for 500 + days ? 
  plural ( m + mixed ) is fran\u00e7ais , plural ( f ) is fran\u00e7aises . 
  latin languages fuck you like that and i love it < 3, 
  i would but very very passively . 
  i would do so mainly out of interest for irish itself and also to get to know irish culture and history even better , but i 'd probably never do it enough to actually understand it fully . 
  just a bit to know what 's what . 
  as an italian citizen no . 
  eu citizenship guarantees you the right to live , work , and study anywhere in the eu with the same access as a national . 
  first thing that came to my mind tbh . 
  i thought about `` oshit here comes yugoslavia '' but it seemed in poor taste and not really as accurate . 
  oh yeah , that 's a really nice building as well . 
  especially that garden it has just outside . 
  * oshit here come these romans with their alphabet and shit , * *** ruuuun *** / s, 
  can be summed up in one sound : * ugh *, 
  i dunno , just feels a bit odd in my opinion , but it really is a small detail . 
  i sometimes watch bbc and bbc 2 whenever a good documentary is on . 
  recently i watched this one about a trip to myanmar , pretty nice . 
  i ca n't really tell you how much it costs though , since the tv subscription i have actually comes with the house itself . 
  but the bbc is included in nearly every ( if not all ) subscription . 
   the soviet era linnahall *** what the actual fucking fuck is that oh god help .
