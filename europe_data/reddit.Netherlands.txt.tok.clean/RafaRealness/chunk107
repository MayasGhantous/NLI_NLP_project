  delicious , and cheap . 
  i 'm not really into roma or sinti culture at all , there is at often times an opposition between what `` normal '' european cultures all converge and agree on and suddenly they do n't really conform . 
  does n't help that they also have a massively bad reputation no matter where they go , and instead of trying to fix the issue and being exemplary , most of the visible ones seem to not care and keep on being living stereotypes . 
  i consider monday the start , but linguistically sunday . 
  in portuguese monday , tuesday , wednesday , thursday , and friday do n't really have proper names , they are called second market , third market , etc. . . segunda-feira = monday ter\u00e7a-feira = tuesday quarta-feira = wednesday quinta-feira = thursday sexta-feira = friday s\u00e1bado = saturday ( the sabbath ) domingo = sunday so ... we sorta counted sunday as the first day and then every other day we counted them as `` the day of this or that market '' . 
  usually we do n't even write them out anymore , we just write stuff like 2a or 4a , and instead of saying the `` feira '' at the end , we just say `` second '' or `` sixth '' ... 
  please note we do n't ever use adjective numerals ( second , third , fourth , etc. . . ) for days of the * month * ( those are regular numbers like one , two , three , etc. . . ) imagine my struggles as a kid 5 extra names for each day of the week when i 'm used to having mainly numbers . 
  so yeah , linguistically i look at sunday as the first day , but in everyday life it 's definitely monday . 
  well , hungary still is a democracy since there is opposition , there are elections , there is media , etc. . . 
  it is n't great ( no system is perfect ) , as proven by the current state of affairs , but it still very much is a democratic system, 
  ... yes let 's ignore the thousands upon thousands of legal provisions that make the eu pretty tame , as well as the fact that the democratic criteria the eu uses has been set by member states themselves , and also how pretty constant the eu is overruled because * it is n't really a dictatorship * it 's getting pretty old . 
  yaaasss . 
  i 'm sure that you 'll fit in here just fine , if you do . 
  whenever i read his name i just have a soundbite of him shouting his own name like a superhero . 
  i agree to it however i believe that there are limits that need to be determined by the peoples themselves : the government should only rule on areas of its own competence by consent of its own citizens . 
  not accurate , it ignores western russia , and the west of that strait in turkey , and those parts of georgia and kazakhstan . 
  it 's even very contradicting because you remove western russia , but you do not remove kaliningrad . 
  ... i am actually shocked holy shit . 
  kudos to your school fuck yeah . 
   0 % for basic needs like medicine ( i think ) , nah , those go in the 6 % category . 
  the 0 % tier is reserved for `` taxation of gold coins ; intra-community and international passenger transport by air and sea . '', 
  [ here 's a list of all the vats of the european union , including its variations depending on the type of product ] ( http://www.vatlive.com/vat-rates/european-vat-rates/ ) the netherlands ' standard tax is 21 % ( no , not a joke ) , though a * lot * goes into the reduced tax which is only 6 % ( food , clothes , cultural events , restaurants , hotels , domestic travel ... ), 
  the flag is from the council of europe , which includes * all * of europe with the exception of belarus ( currently a candidate ) ( and kosovo if you consider it a country , and kazakhstan if you consider it europe ) all countries portrayed in the banner of the desktop are in there . 
  i 'm studying russian academically in university , and studying dutch in my own time passively . 
   most importantly though , being proud to be british is n't really about the nation 's history and achievements . 
  most people are proud because being british is who they are . 
  you are not proud of your parents or family because they are objectively better than others , you are proud because they are yours , it 's the same with your nation or ethnic group . 
  ** underrated as all bloody hell **, 
  my favorite ever . 
  its simplicity is just so damn grand . 
  for me it does n't sound like other rap songs that i hear , specifically those sounds just ring a bell to me . 
  that is just an example though , some artists try out different ways to convey slightly different sounds . 
  anything with that god-awful lascard shit . 
  [ this comes to mind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioxzg3jjfky ) especially the very odd , kinda childish ? 
  pronounciation of `` d '' and `` j '' , and the stretching out of every word . 
  ... holy shit are you european ? 
  for portugal i have to say football . 
  i 'm not a sports fan but i appreciate a good competition in any healthy case , however every fucking time it 's benfica , porto , etc. . . shit gets crazy . 
  remember that one time a flight from lisbon to istanbul had to do an emergency landing in rome because two portuguese football ultras started fighting ? 
  yeah . 
  for france . 
  for the god of me i do not see the appeal of weird accents in music to make them seem more edgy/cultural . 
  it comes across as just this fake attempt at seeming new and different . 
  for the netherlands , i really do not like how complaining is a national hobby . 
  the metro can be like 2 minutes late and i guarantee you everybody will complain . 
  ** hello from the other siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide **, 
  the portuguese would like to have a word with you . 
  nor nato ... 
  i mean , that fake payment request ? 
  * fucking seriously ? 
  yes , i think so too , plus i think that perhaps someone in the white house briefed him on how the us/eu relations actually are , instead of the bile whispers from nigel and the like ... 
  yeah , though i think that trump is a bit of a yes-man , so i do n't really believe he 's pro/anti anything , he just says whatever gains him cheers depending on who he 's talking to ... 
  exactly , that system for me is just broken and outdated in so many ways , and it could easily be fixed if the votes from each state were at least proportional to the final polls of the population , not a winner-takes-all situation that just creates swing states ... 
  for me he sounds like a very odd leader as he actively tries to roll back the democratic process that hungary underwent . 
  i also greatly mind his fables and lies about `` eeeviiil bruuusseeeels '' . 
  i can appreciate opposition to eu decisions ( dialogue and debate is always welcome ) however this is not at all the type of opposition anyone needs , this is an aspiring dictator that focuses on ( surprise surprise ) sensationalism and distortion to fill out his own agenda . 
   i mean i 'd like to see you be tougher on trump ... * me ? 
  * i wish we could as well but the truth is the us has always been a very close ally of the eu , and why would we start shit over an idiot getting elected for 4 years ? 
  if this does not change after his turn or escalate during these 4 years then yes sure , but thus far there is not a lot of reason for it compared to the alternative . 
   but i also recognize the power imbalance between the us and any of the individual eu states as well as your respect for even vaguely democratic elections . 
  the eu is pretty strong , but it is very uncoordinated compared to an actual state , and as for respecting democratic processes , well i 'd argue that the us election system is not democratic ( candidate with the least amount of votes won , wow . ), 
  however if the eu took a stance in this matter then it would need to rewrite a lot of its standards concerning the rule of democracy , which to be fair it 's far too much of a hassle to ever really be done ( works fine in the eu , bit useless to change it for a country * outside * of it ) . 
  ** hell no ** . 
  i do not believe that a state should take an official ideology nor indisputable guiding principle . 
  everything must be properly discussed with healthy amounts of input and dialogue . 
  the eu ( and any type of institution with legal competences ) should remain ideally neutral and act when prompted to by the competent representative or direct democratic processes . 
   i guess i hang out with the right kind of people . 
  :( well damn i 'm hurt . 
  as best it can , but my god , how does * anyone * handle trump ? 
  he changes sides and opinions more often than his underwear . 
  as for putin , stuff 's cold and will likely stay that way . 
  xi seems to have warmer relationships with the eu which i think can be positive , though always stay alert ( do n't really trust a one-party state with high censorship ) . 
  erdogan , well , * anything that will make him shut up for twelve minutes is worth it right now * . 
  the eu is quite tied because of its refugee deal agreement , though i think that once the refugee crisis calms the hell down he 's gon na be * shuuuunned * . 
   i 'm actually wondering , is it possible to un-invoke article 50 , or is there no going back for the uk at this point ? 
  or is it possible for them to brexit , and rejoin the eu the next day ? 
  it is entirely possible to sorta `` un-invoke '' article 50 . 
  the negotiations basically must just result on `` okay , we wo n't leave the eu '' with the agreement of all 28 members . 
  ( doubt the uk will * eeeeveeeeer * go back on it during the 2 years though ) . 
  that 's it , that 's literally it . 
  if the uk terminates the negotiations ( with or without a deal ) then the uk will need to reapply altogether for eu membership . 
   i 'm saying europeans ( intentionally ? ), 
  misunderstand americans who do . 
  you know damn well they do n't believe they 're citizens . 
  be reasonable . 
  not intentional , and you can be irish/swedish/polish / et al without citizenship ( case and point , my mom does n't have french citizenship yet she is * very * french ) . 
  i have an austrian friend who does not have austrian citizenship because he was born in germany and his parents ( nor him ) ever gave a fuck to change it , yet he lived all his life in vienna . 
  again , am i angolan , chinese , portuguese , french , english * and * spanish ? 
  i am not , therefore i 'm not going to say `` oh i 'm x '', 
   there is , but are they claiming that ? 
  if so , in what sense ? 
  do you think they falsely believe they have an irish passport ? 
  there are many anecdotes all over europe about american immigrants coming over and saying `` oh i 'm swedish/spanish/french / etc. . . 
  too ! '', 
  even though for the average european that is not true . 
  you are an american with foreign ancestry , however if you do not share the cultural , social , and linguistic norms of whichever national group you claim to belong to , you merely are not . 
  it 's not that big of a deal , but it 's definitely something that happens , and often annoys a little amount of us at any given moment . 
   or is `` i 'm irish '' simply shorthand for `` i 'm of irish descent '' ? 
  they do n't mean the same thing though , otherwise i could say i 'm angolan and chinese . 
   global irish provides information for irish people and people of irish descent living outside of ireland , helping them maintain their connections to ireland .
