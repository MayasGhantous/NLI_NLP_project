  it says irish people and people of irish descent , one does not mean the other . 
  plus i think that it 's great that people with irish descent would like to get in touch with ireland itself , but there is a pretty big difference between doing that and being a self-proclaimed irishman . 
  * well , i for one would n't say no to ` straya *, 
  ... well i mean do you want to ? 
  i think that americans that claim to have a heritage here without speaking the language or any experience with its culture are kind of the worst , an `` irish-american '' is not irish ffs . 
  then there is also the guys who think europe is the end-all-be-all paradise where they can just kick back and relax but get pretty shocked when we do n't like lazy immigrants who come here and do n't integrate ( not even attempt to speak the local language ) . 
  those are the americans we * do n't * like . 
  that being said , there are lots of americans that come to europe with already a good knowledge on what to expect administration-wise , who definitely integrate nicely and learn the language ( may take time , but they do it regardless ) and become even great citizens eventually . 
  those are the americans we love , the happy hardworking sane immigrants . 
  same way any student does : apply for university and get an education . 
  there 's a 40 year old guy who comes to my lectures ( which are even open to visitors of the university ) and i 'm a bit certain he 's actually enrolled in my programme . 
  nice fella , he 's doing really damn well too . 
  no , and your question is wrong , that was not the case for the president of france . 
  this relationship ever really began when both were two consenting adults , which as you may guess is very standard in france . 
  the fact that you believed him and actually needed to ask proves something . 
  none of the above , the portuguese historical emigration was basically what it is here in the netherlands : * sneeeaky * ( seriously i 'm portuguese and i can not find other portuguese people unless they tell me they are portuguese ) basically they seem to have assimilated very well and entirely `` disappeared '' , plus i never met an american claiming to be portuguese due to ancestry . 
  for me it was just people who chose to be courageous and try a different life , and for most of them they found a new home . 
  social progression seems to be a pretty big topic , as well as having more connections and experiences to share . 
  connections with other eu unis is a very good place to start . 
  also , better investment in public infrastructure ( have you * seen * a romanian train ? 
  ** a ** ** fucking ** ** lot ** i basically get through around half a liter a day on average , and it feels like i 'm constantly buying milk . 
  okay , what about * finland * and its investments in green power in southwestern europe ? 
  or austrian investments in tech research as well ? 
  or also even the german investments in biomedical research in lisbon ? 
  point is , there 's been countless instances of investment and development all over the worse-off areas in south europe mainly paid by northern european contributions towards the cohesion funds as well as tonnes of non-eu investment initiatives . 
  to take the greek example as `` oh the north do n't care ! '', 
  is ignoring * tonnes upon tonnes * of evidence this is not true , as well as also ignoring very important articles of the relevant ecb treaties . 
  the north can not save greece , in fact , nobody other than greece can . 
  there is a clear policy of no bailouts in the eurozone , it was a fundamental concept granted everyone would follow the criteria set for it ( which included debt and deficit limits , which greece not only knowingly ignored but lied about ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 'd be impressed by how northern countries like france defend portugal to this day ... 
  yes , since the beginning even , belgium was a founding state . 
  ... says who ? 
  according to every single treaty all languages of the eu have an equal footing , from luxembourgish to german and from latvian to french . 
  rejoin by the rules that apply to anyone else . 
  no rebates at all , you must join the euro , you must join schengen , you must adopt * every . 
  single . 
  thing * we require for new member states . 
  rules exist for a reason and it is not fair that the uk , after the havoc brexit caused , could just go back to its previously highly privileged position . 
  the uk will be coming as an outsider and shall be treated as such . 
   croatian , serbian in my uni a serbian and a croat colleague of mine had a pretty heated ( but still civil ) argument over if croatian and serbian are actually languages or just dialects of serbocroat . 
  it felt like the croatian spring at times , like , seriously . 
  i think that in the media and on reddit there is beef going on with the eu vs the uk , however it constantly goes understated that * we do not hate british people * . 
  you 're just as welcome to visit us and spend some time relaxing in sunnier places , we should n't wish you any harm and i hope we stay as amicable . 
  1386 best year of my life haha, 
  no , i do n't believe at all this is a matter of skin color in my case . 
  compared to my algerian friend ( she was the same color of skin i was ) we both got different treatments and perceptions ( hers were more negative and of a different nature ) . 
  poles are as white ( if not even whiter ) as french people , and they also get some comparable treatments . 
  yes , i 've got a fair few odd difficulties based on the sole fact that i 'm portuguese when i lived in france . 
  stuff like `` i think you should do a bac pro '' even though i had very high grades , or the endless reminder jokes that stereotypes exist , and , in my opinion worst of all : when i wrote my name in portuguese and noted my professional experience in portugal , i was near-instantly refused , but when i did the same thing but spelled my name the french way and removed any mention of location , suddenly i was brought in for an interview . 
  french people themselves do not actively discriminate against portuguese people , they still remain very open and welcoming , but in some cases there still is clear cases of `` unspoken '' discrimination . 
  a good portrait of it can be seen in a movie called la cage dor\u00e9e . 
  i 'm pretty ashamed of portugal 's policies regarding budget and economy in general , i believe that we deserve/need better . 
  i 'm so so sorry . 
  education equivalence in all the eu !, 
  [ here 's a list of the chapters and their level of progress ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) there are some sectors that are undergoing change in order to better be prepared and compatible with the european union , though they seem to be going very slowly . 
  that 's true , though the process is not frozen in the least , and the opening and closing of chapters is still ongoing for serbia . 
  the sole thing is that there are still * a lot * of preperation prerequisites that serbia does not yet fulfill , and it 'll take certainly years to get through them all . 
  it takes 20 $ on your ov chipkaart to enter any ns train , at exit should the cost exceed the 20 $ you will have a 6 $ debt . 
  agreed . 
  i would also add that there would need to be better punishments and consequences for deceitful campaigning ( judged by a * neutral * entity with no interest on neither side winning ) ; this would ensure that campaigning would be driven by facts and truth , not by sensationalist garbage . 
  ... do n't have it * yet * . 
  serbia is still a candidate for eu membership , perhaps in the future !, 
  to me benefits to parents only should come to * actual * parents , and this should also not be only for biological parents as i believe that adoptive parents are just as good as biological ones . 
  the marriage union should be kept within the terms of legal representation and joint responsibility . 
  these need to be consistent across the board for any citizens . 
  i agree that the system in a lot of countries is not at all well thought out and even outdated . 
  in amsterdam sikhs are generally pretty rare . 
  the turban is not really something associated with islam but definitely foreign to dutch culture . 
  they are either seen as tourists or as residents but not really integrated , still , they are not really seen as muslims since they do n't fit the general perception of a `` typical '' muslim because of the turban itself . 
   i meant non romantic partners . 
  usually not the ones you marry . 
   i never said i support the christian side of marriage , i was just saying historical facts . 
  in fact im completely against legally recognizing church marriages as it happens in some countries . 
  and against legal recognition of organized religion , as something different that a non profit ngos . 
  so why not legalize state-recognition for gay marriage ? 
  if you recognize one why not the other ? 
  because of history ? 
   infertile people get married because of tradition . 
  in the past there was no way to check for infertility and obviously it was a custom to marry first , have sex later . 
  so there are marriages that are * not * about having children that are allowed then , with all the legal implications and representation that implies , even britney spears ' 72h marriage . 
   do n't forget that civil marriage in europe comes from the christian tradition . 
  and the numbering system came from arabia . 
  the christian tradition did n't exactly * invent * marriage either as it is present in nearly all cultures of the earth ( common concept ) . 
  furthermore , if you want to base yourself strictly on what the christian tradition is , then which one ? 
  should we go orthodox or catholic ? 
  and why are we not following other christian customs by law as well , such as not wearing mixed fabrics ? 
  for me , to use religion as essentially an excuse to deprive someone of their equal rights makes it quite hipocritical as there is no real following of * all * the commandments from the holy bible . 
  should women really never speak in churches for example ? 
   and you 're saying like it 's so obvious that indoor people should have the right to marry . 
  it 's not like that . 
  you 're cultural environment familiar to you is clouding your judgment . 
  ... i grew up in a pretty damn religious country where gay marriage was not a thing or even addressed ( same for abortion ) until i moved away . 
  i am pretty certain i am familiar with what it 's like to live in a society where religion takes a primordial place even at the cost of others ' rights . 
  my country , however , managed to separate bias and personal taste from juridical and legal representation , thus legalizing gay marriage and there are still strong pushes to legalize gay adoption . 
   i do n't believe romantic relationships deserve special benefits . 
  why should they ? 
  those that come with it should become easily available to other people , like friends , partners and relatives . 
  partners * are * romantic relationships though , and these are not `` special benefits '' in the least these are merely legal defense no matter what 's between someone 's legs . 
  i defend that civil marriage ( and its legal representation and benefits ) should be a right of any citizen as they deserve to be treated with the utmost respect . 
  unless of course you 'd prefer japan 's creepy solution .
