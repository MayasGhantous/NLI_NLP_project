   and the culture is undergoing a change . 
  the line between girl/boy friend and a spouse is blurring , also in the case of legal marriages , less people are getting married clearly showing that perhaps marriage is not all that it 's cranked out to be , though the legal value and standing of a civic marriage still stands at often times as a barrier between hundreds of thousands of couples just because they are gay . 
   religion does n't allow for gay marriages because of this , these rules came after human ( or rather animal ) nature has been a thing . 
  it 's not like religion made this stuff up for no reason . 
  why do infertile people get to be married then ? 
   after all love and marriage is based primarely around having children , even if some people may not realize it . 
  declare all other marriages without children void , fuck 'em right ? 
   so i say that state sanctioned marriages should n't be a thing . 
  let 's take this back - let 's make this about children , not the couples . 
  the state institution i mean . 
  marriage is not just a money sack you get , you know ? 
  you also earn certain legal representation at the eyes of the law and its institutions , like visitors ' rights in hospitals or jail for example . 
  plus , if marriage is all about just having kids , then why not make adoption a more attractive choice ? 
  why have even more kids instead of focusing the ones who have no parents ? 
  there are thousands of warm and loving families , both gay and straight , so perhaps we should get to it . 
   yes there 's one guy from my village that moved to eindhoven and he tried to explain what you just did but he is n't as articulated as you are , so thank you for explaining it in such a easy to understand the dutch system is really not that hard : you need a dutch residence , a dutch bank account , and a health insurance ( private , for employment ) , that basically is it . 
  you get access to * dutch * health insurance , dutch education for you or your kids , etc. . .  yes , we have one face that we show the world , one that we show our friends and family and another that is our real face and that only we know ... something in the lines of this i think that was it , though i 'm not sure . 
   yes , exactly !, 
  but when you start working for real , how will you deal with social security matters ? 
  in the netherlands the system is very simple , i am required to contribute as much as a dutch citizen , and also get to claim the same local benefits as a dutch citizen . 
  that is the joy of being an eu citizen when it comes to social and employment matters . 
   once again you are right !, 
  that also reminds me of that japanese theory ( ? ), 
  that we have 3 faces , do you know it ? 
  yeah , i 've heard about it a while back i think . 
   hm , take advantage of the benefits do n't be dumb , if they exist its for people to use them , i do n't mean abuse them its all with `` conta e medida '' i merely want to have a clear conscience as well as maximize my own benefits . 
  i am not taking away from anybody else while also reserving my own rights and abiding the law , so it 's merely a question of being well informed in reality . 
   this got dark all of the sudden , lol nah , it 's only as dark as people make it out to be , i mean , no person is exactly the same with friends at home as they are when they work . 
  it 's part of nature in my opinion , multiple sides of what makes us-us , humans are n't meant to be one-dimensional . 
   smart move on your part !, 
  i am not proud of it but i have touched upon certain ways that the singular citizenship law in the netherlands can be bent for flexibility , which would greatly benefit me in no cost of the dutch state . 
   shh no one needs to know that for real its always nice to have a good sense of humour and be playful that does n't mean you are childish or less mature everybody 's got multiple sides . 
  quantas l\u00ednguas falas ? 
   uau !, 
  very focused and goal driven !, 
  if it was now would you still go through all the bureaucracy ? 
  or not really ? 
  for me you would only be french the moment you spoke portuguese with a fake french accent or if you came back and spoke in french to everyone and then turned around and spoke in pt , that actually happened !, 
  a man asked me for directions in french , i almost `` died '' trying to explain it to him and then he turns around and speaks portuguese to his wife i believe that i would definitely go through with it if i had the opportunity , furthermore i count on doing so for the dutch citizenship ( though i 'm awaiting debates on dual citizenship as it is currently very sketchy ) . 
   hats off !, 
  after everything you wrote you must be like 20 and with tons of maturity to offer !, 
  i 'm actually 20 , though as for maturity ... well it depends on the occasion , haha . 
   ok , `` tudei waz a gude dei '' for you then !, 
  i 'm kidding , i assume you would vote for him , but i asked because i thought since you went to france at 14 that you had decided to get double nationality or something i did , and actually tried to do so , however french bureaucracy is the worst hellhole i have ever seen . 
  in theory you must reside constantly in france for 5 years as well as speak french ( i fulfilled all the requirements * by a damn mile * ) however the procedure itself takes months , in some cases a year or more , to actually get citizenship . 
  my priority between citizenship and education was clear : i needed to give up on being a full french citizen and instead pursue my studies here in amsterdam . 
   that 's right !, 
  you are very assertive and you clearly have strong opinions , its refreshing !, 
  i agree with you about the anonymity after getting constant shit both in portugal and in france by the schooling systems , as well as being faced with the lackluster aspects of national education , i somewhat started feeling very strongly about the topic of education . 
   its fairly recent if we look at the grand scheme of the rest of europe , but it seems well established , so that makes it even mote impressive that you got in !, 
  how far are you in your degree ? 
  i am one year in , only 2 more to go . 
   boa !, 
   this got me thinking , and this question can be stupid , so sorry in advance but could you vote in the french elections ? 
  i would vote for macron in both rounds , so i 'm happy with the result . 
   yes but that works when you have a big class , not in secondary school or whatever where they know every student and grade according to how much they like you uva sounds very interesting though !, 
  how old is the university ? 
  because i assume its a very well known university yet i hear more about twente that is why i believe in full student anonymity , because that entirely eliminates the probability of student/professor preference and makes it thus more focused on content presented than actual relationship . 
  the uva was established in 1632 and is the third oldest university of all of the netherlands . 
   true dat !, 
  but macron won so there 's that  ** car c'est notre projet **  yes i see , honestly being objective is better , it 's fairer ( ? ), 
  to everyone it , again , depends a lot , because objective and excessively strict answer-requirements can actually be detrimental and pejorative to the students as well as to the teachers and professors themselves . 
  for me , a balance between the two is the best , and it is how the uva works : half the grade is very objective , mainly you know or you do not , no ifs nor buts , and the second one is open for essay writing where you demonstrate your knowledge by application . 
  i just expect people to brush off their shoes at the door , but then again i 'm not actually dutch , i 'm portuguese/french . 
  i mainly let people do whatever they feel comfortable with , i do n't mind either way . 
  so for you all of those whom have only one parent do not have a family ? 
  that is also true , i think that it 's a decisions that * back then * served a true scientific purpose and now does n't , and i also think that for 90 % of people this law is very obscure . 
  i 'd like to have it formally banned , but it 's not really a pressing issue , i believe that the netherlands has already more than established its stance on equality for gay people . 
   what the hell ? 
  i kid you not but old people here that lived in france are actually sort of supporting her , because she is what france needs to still be france in the future they say ... 
  ignorance does n't know borders . 
   ahahah keep that up it will help you have awesome grades !, 
  i usually read wikipedia but i never know if i should believe entirely in what i am reading but it 's cool to know little random facts and amaze people the biggest shock for me was going into a more subjective process for exams , because the exercises leave a * lot * of place for personal taste by the corrector , but also more freedom for the student to express himself as he wishes . 
  it 's a trade-off situation . 
  i read up a * lot * on that , and it 's not really enforced ( it 's the same law in france , but it 's not applied in the least if you donate blood ) . 
  the reasoning is that gay people ( specifically men ) are more likely to contract hiv , which considering that gay males used to have sexual practices with higher chances of contamination . 
  this is actually true , however for nearly everyone is no longer applicable/applied . 
  there is this drug called prep that can extremely reduce your changes of ever contracting hiv , and it is particularly growing in popularity within the gay community . 
  this can , in the future and fused with * far * better sex ed resources and openness about the subject , can bring about drastic change that already is beginning to take root among the younger generations of gay people . 
  so there * was * a reason for it back then , but nowadays it is mostly ignored , and the issue is already being rectified . 
  you seem to care enough to comment . 
  i care , so ... we care ? 
  [ ** relevant ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxvcgdmbu94 ), 
  i agree , though i think that the decline of pride parades will come more as a social effect , because if truly it becomes pointless then it 'll go away by itself . 
  `` german should not be authorized in public , it has no place in a [ x ] society '' `` germans do not deserve to marry or adopt any children because this is a [ x ] society '' as a gay dude , i will kiss whoever i wish in public just like any straight person , be it in a dutch beach , or on top of the tv tower in berlin . 
  entirely equal as straight people , no ifs nor buts . 
  full marriage and adoption . 
  luckily for me , it 's already a thing so i 'm very happy with it . 
  i 'm biased as hell ( i 'm gay so ... ) . 
   yes , and if for some forsaken reason le pen wins ... lord . . 
  i watched the debate and she is out of touch with reality . . having francs for people and small companies but euros for the bigger ones ? 
  lol or mdr yep , she also * entirely ignored * that all schooling in france is done in french ... she wanted french to be half of the curriculum ... 
  i kid you not . 
   really ? 
  its fascinating !, 
  what else is different ? 
  the evaluation norms in general greatly vary from country to country , and maths is no exception . 
  it 's a bit complicated though . 
   cool !, 
  if you want we can talk about it !,
