  i think that you 're a voter and you can forge your own opinion , so you 're free to vote for whatever you feel is correct for the uk . 
  if there 's a party that meets your criteria , go ahead . 
  oh c'mon , england is not * inherently * bad at all . 
  sure you may have tonnes of problems now but hey , look at france and germany and how many times they fucked up . 
  you can take pride on being english and push for a better england based on fairer leadership , hell , you can even do it for the uk too . 
  do n't think that any country should sink , just think about * changing * your country to float better . 
   did you never have that toy as a kid where you had to put shapes in their corresponding hole ? 
  is it sad that i actually did n't ? 
  i mean , i recognize that toy as it 's hella common everywhere but i do n't think i ever had one . 
  it 's a nice idiom though !, 
  donald is n't dependent on poland though , poland is n't in full control of the european council , so i doubt he cares what pis thinks . 
  eurosceptic sentiment in poland * is * a thing and a big one at that but what exactly can poland realistically do ? 
  keep in mind that the polish government owns medias that still spread daily mail-quality `` journalism '' about the eu to keep it , and once pis is gone , poland will likely return to its former , more cooperative self . 
  as for reassuring his countrymen , no , there are n't * millions * of poles in the uk , there are barely 3 million eu citizens in total , plus , again , he is * president of the european council * so he needs to address eu * governments * in general , because his nomination depends on a qualified majority voting that poland alone does not have nor ever will . 
  this is still all assuming he is doing all this because he cares for his presidency , which poland ( or rather pis ) hate , but due to the fact that the european council makes choices based in a qualified majority voting system , poland does n't get to say what 's what . 
  oooooooh , yeah that makes sense . 
  i do n't really think there 's anything in it but `` it 's a shame to see a member state leave '' , i mean he did n't say anything really like `` britain , you made a wrong decision '' . 
  i think it really is up for interpretation though , it * can * go either way . 
  well , i do n't really get what you 're getting at . 
  also , if 5star are all they are cranked up to be , why do n't they win more votes ? 
  also , why exactly did the uk sign both maastricht and lisbon , even under these warnings ? 
  is the uk thus led by an elite and needs a populist party to shake things up , like ukip ? 
   populism is a political doctrine that proposes that the common people are exploited by a privileged elite , and which seeks to resolve this . 
  the underlying ideology of populists can be left , right , or center . 
  what you said was an extremely short and misleading definition of populism , so here 's a better one . 
  keep in mind that you can * call yourself * a populist and not be one , like for example , hitler killing his fellow political opponents can very easily fit into the populist narrative ; all you really need to do is point your finger and say `` elites !, 
  is n't this something we 've * already * seen ? 
  plus , i 'm french and even though the fn is the fastest rising political party it 's because they were * shit before * , and these elections are most likely going to be a rerun of the 2002 elections as shown by all of the national polls . 
  you 're talking about a party that wants half of all education to be french classes , while ignoring that * all * education in france is already in french , thus bringing the entire redundancy of it , and also you are talking about a party whose proposed frexit could not even pass by l'assembl\u00e9e ... we are n't like the uk where * one * party calls the shots , especially not a party that was created by * a vehement holocaust denier and known racist * . 
  it 's funny that you also chose italy that even though it has eurosceptic parties , it still is mainly a supporter of the eu , and as for poland , i 'm still waiting for poland to do * anything * against the eu itself . 
  this is n't the first nor the last rise of euroscepticism in the eu , but the fact is that wilders lost and ca n't form a decent coalition ( * again * ) the fn is just rerunning the same exact issues with the same exact polls that made them lose * again * and the afd even had the lowest results * ever * is an indicator that this is just a repetition of last time we had euroscepticism on the rise . 
  i 'm really not worried , and nor should you in my opinion , i mean , you 're already out , what 's it to you what * we * decide to do ? 
  well , considering most of us here in the continent are n't , sure . 
  and who the fuck is `` we '' ? 
  ... but are n't you in the efta * and * schengen ? 
   square peg in a round hole i have no idea what this means , no seriously i have no clue . 
  do n't walk , ** run ** . 
  it 's not * that * hard and you can keep your british citizenship in some countries just fine . 
  just come on over to the continent , integrate , live here for a while , and bam . 
  seriously ? 
  you 're celebrating a terror attack ? 
  what the everlasting fuck ... 
  username . 
  take your updoot and leave . 
  ** he 'll have to make an appointment with deez hands at the airport though **, 
   snuff films and potatoes . 
  i hate that i laughed . 
  i feel like this is the irl application of that expression that goes '' ** bitch i hope the fuck you do ** '', 
  can confirm , i basically became french while over there , plus french education is very effective on integrating most people to the maximum extent ( for example , you need a baccalaur\u00e9at to do anything , and that fully requires a very good level of the french language , and for the fili\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale you need to have very good historical knowledge of france as well as an adequate grasp of francophone literature and arts ) . 
  i * also * have to say though that there are some portuguese people that do n't really make efforts to integrate that well , generally those over 35 , who in portugal act like they are high rollers ( they are not , they are chavs to us ) because they live in france , whereas in france they believe they are hot shit because they are from portugal ... thankfully they usually are not a big nuisance , and i 'm pretty sure everyone knows we 're not all like them . 
  i never really did , and i appreciate that you like us back . 
  the thing is that neither of us can deny that brexit is going to have new borders implemented between us , the question is * what * borders we 'll see and just how far we 'll be divided in practical terms . 
  i know , however i have yet to see what exactly brexit means and just how divided we 're going to become . 
  so you 'd riot against the terrorists right ? 
  well , i 'd highly urge anone not to go to isis and just riot over there . 
  well , i mean ... 
  i heard russia is lovely at this time of the year . 
  you mean new lisbon ? 
  no but jokes aside , portuguese people tend to move to french-speaking parts of the continent a * lot * , hence why there are so many of us in france , luxembourg , and switzerland . 
  it helps that we are usually very welcome , and a lot of us speak french so it works out . 
  thanks dude !, 
  it 's been a pleasure having you , and do n't let brexit get to you that much . 
  should you choose to come back ( be it just northern ireland or scotland or whatever ) i hope we welcome you with open arms . 
  if you count that as a `` riot '' then sure ... but what exactly would the french be rioting against in the event of a terrorist attack ? 
  you wish , we 're * just too sexy *, 
   you are assuming that the same number of people will keep coming . 
  look at australia : the influx dried up almost completely . 
  this is all about incentives . 
  same reason people go to western europe and not poland . 
  even if we did nothing to protect the border but just cancelled all welfare and support you 'd already see a massive reduction ( i bet even 90 % ) . 
  i agree that we have excessive welfare plans for refugees , and i also believe that they should be granted the same exact welfare anywhere in the eu to prevent them from cherry picking western states over anyone else just because they get more money this way . 
  the issue with this is that this can possibly generate crime waves for the ones already here , since it has been shown for ages on end that individuals that are economically at great disadvantage are * far * more likely to commit crimes , which is something already happening and that does not need even more fuel . 
  firstly we need to make sure that the borders are more secure and make it a less attractive option and * also * deal with the ones whom are already here . 
   not just the vessels . 
  the people responsible should be put into prison for human trafficking . 
  otherwise they will just get new vessels : some of these ngos are extremely rich . 
  agreed , fully . 
   a few people coming through is not a problem . 
  a million people per year is a problem . 
  yes , i agree , and that is why i believe we need * both * a better organisation internally to deal with them , as well as a far better response to the border issues . 
   that is because it is accountable . 
  without open borders this issue would never have become so big . 
  the eu always does the easy part of a job ( removing internal borders , common currency ) but fails at the hard part of the problem ( enforcing outer borders , stabilising different economies ) which means that any minor advantages of those policies get completely outweighed by the disadvantages ( refugee crisis , euro crisis ) . 
  but the eu has * no * jurisdiction over any external borders , those policies are strictly controlled by the member states in question ( italy , poland , finland , the baltics , etc. . . ) . 
  the eu had `` the easy part '' because the eu only controls the eu , and even then a * lot * of the powers are still fully the domain of the national governments . 
  furthermore , keep in mind that portugal and spain 's economies were very shaky after our dictatorships but the introduction of the ec helped us out a great deal , and the euro made trade with the rest of the eu also flourish ( not to mention , the eu has no power over the ecb , they are separate ) . 
  the refugee crisis and the euro crisis need powers ( such as enforcement of security in external borders or budgetary reassessment ) that only the national governments has and although the eu can and has made tonnes of advisory actions to push these , they still go ignored more often than not . 
  the eu is not in charge of external borders , it barely is in charge of * internal * borders , so i fail to see how it 's accountable . 
  norway liechtenstein iceland and switzerland are in the schengen area and are not at all in the eu , so i 'm not sure how you can consider the eu in charge of borders . 
  how very gypsy of him to be moving around all the time like a nomad ^ ( / s ), 
  have you been paying attention to the french polls ? 
  this is just a rerun of 2002 again ... plus even * if * she is elected , the french system does not allow * one * crazy president to do whatever she wishes , and that includes leaving the eurozone . 
  that decision requires * far * bigger support than she has ever had or probably ever will . 
   yes , because they are free to do whatever they want . 
  living in a holding area is n't as much fun . 
  but how exactly would you design a holding area big enough to host so many people and their basic needs ? 
  that would take up * even more * space than the current arrangement . 
  not to mention , it can also be more expensive . 
   people who cross the border illegally should not be allowed to leave the holding areas under any circumstance , even if they are valid refugees . 
  this means that almost nobody will do that anymore , so you do n't need a big area at all .
