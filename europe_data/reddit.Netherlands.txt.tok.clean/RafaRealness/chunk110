  because here i bore everyone with my love for european matters xp i mean , i read articles from the tfeu for fun because i get bored in the metro , so * test my boredom levels *  me too !, 
  you are cool , i hope we can be friends !, 
   well , i see the point in it , why hide your ancestry ? 
  accents should be celebrated i know what you mean about the french government not taking the right measures when it comes to teaching languages in the best possible , but when they have such a big country and a big `` market '' , why do they need to learn more than the basics of other language ? 
  it feels like this is how they think that 's precisely the problem , this is not about hiding your ancestry it 's about being * understood * which a lot of french people unfortunately are not . 
  especially in a globalized world , foreign language skills are often expected expected by more competent multinationals . 
  it also is * fully * ignored in the french education system how learning a foreign language can open up so many doors to you , or how studies abroad are actually a thing . 
   hein ? 
  how are calculators different ?? 
  by writing conventions do you mean ponctuation or what do you mean ? 
  not the same conventional terms , y = in france is f ( x ) = and f ( x ) is something different as well . 
  plus the names for certain terms and prononciation are very french-ified . 
  also , i noticed that french people are taught to precise every single step of the calculation and justify it , whereas in portugal it was basically do it all to arrive to the last complete formula , calculate it , boom : answer . 
   so you are currently taking a bachelors ? 
  in european studies that 's very cool !!, 
  i am writing my dissertation ( masters ) about the community passport , its about banks being able to open branches in other member states with an authorization from their original state which valid for every country in the eu that sounds right in line with what we 're studying right now actually !, 
  we 're doing legal & economic integration of europe , so we 're likely going to touch up on that as well . 
  i have tonnes of questions about it , especially with brexit and all . 
   i can see you being very good with tourists , for one you seem to be amazed by different cultures and finding common ground , otherwise you would n't be a part of this forum  i work in a caf\u00e9 , i do more stuff but i dont know how to explain properly hell yeah i love finding out how other people go about stuff , especially more monotonous smaller things like what to eat , or tv tastes , transportation , etc. . . the civil average life . 
  you can explain it just fine , em qualquer lingua que prefiras :p, 
  hurts but you 're right , i shop at the bottom two . 
  ; _ ; edit : should we include stach ? 
  [ kapsalon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kapsalon ), 
   i always assumed that the whole `` the french only know french '' was a big joke because they had heavier accents when speaking english , after all its true to an extent ? 
  the heavier accent is more of a consequence than a pre-given fact in my opinion : * due to * substandard english ( and basically every other language ) being taught in france , nearly nobody really learns to pronounce much without an accent ...  you went woth your mother but you were 16 , not everyone has the guts to leave everything behind like you did and start over !, 
  you left your friends , your home , your family ( ? 
  ) , and who knows what else i admire you because that 's something i would like to do but at the same time i do n't want to leave the confort of the things i know and am familiar with i was 14 , and to be fair i never felt like i was leaving a lot behind ( not a lot of friends , school results were meh , etc. . . ) and leaving my confort area definitely gave me not only some perspective on what to be grateful for , but also on how to build a life towards a better future . 
   yes i see you really benefit from it !, 
   how can maths be affected by the language ? 
  with history and other social sciences i can see it happening but with maths ? 
  : s portugal and france have different writing conventions , i 'm not kidding . 
  even the calculators ' buttons are different because * fuck you if you ever thought that maths would be standardized * . 
   so you are pretty intelligent , maybe that 's why you can integrate and adapt so well in these 3 countries and in all the others you visit plus you seem to have actually learnt from your experiences like the `` denmark fail '' i really liked that last sentence you wrote , it was a great wrap up d'awww thanks !, 
  i consider myself just an average person who got lucky and got taught well to be honest . 
   if you do n't mind me asking ( you dont have to answer if you feel like this is too personal to ask ) but in what field do you work on ? 
  that 's a complicated one , so i 'll leave you this [ link ] ( http://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2015-2016-en/search-programme/programme/1791 ) that essentially explains what i do in university , it 's pretty hard to define i think . 
  as for part-time work , i always try to find something to do in the tourism field , usually just an assistant for something or a retailer , nothing too fancy ( some tourists are horrid though ) . 
  that might be true , i mean , it definitely seems plausible in my opinion . 
  poutine = putin putin is probably salty as hell that macron is very likely to win , thus incomes this . 
   i feel that for some reason you got unlucky with the teachers you got in portugal although i admit its pretty impressive the english part . . 
  i think its still falling short on us because i had english since 1st grade ( like 4 hours a week , maybe less in primary school ) and i always went to public schools . 
  i think it all depends on the students themselves and their willingness to study or to learn i 'm not try to take away the value of what you did , quite the contrary !, 
  i find it very impressive that you had the ability to see that you needed a better educational system and i wish i had the guts to go to another country to pursue my goals english in france ( as are nearly all languages ) is absolute shite . 
  i hate to say it but i was pretty miffed at how low the french standards for foreign languages were ; they were * much * higher in portugal . 
  hence why i did this option , as well as 3 foreign languages at once ( the club ca n't even handle me right noooow ) . 
  i will admit that i went with my mom , so it 's not like i was going fully alone , furthermore france * does * provide this thing called the cla which is a class where you are taught how to speak french and social norms and such ( lost a year doing that basically but it was very worth it as you can imagine . 
   but after france why did you chose the netherlands ? 
  with belgium right there ? 
  specially considering you could use french instead of having to learn dutch and you are already slightly belgian with your 90 :p as i looked around nearing the end of high school in france , i was pretty pissed because everything was far too francocentric for what i wanted to do , plus i really hated the french way of handling foreign languages ( counterproductive as all hell ) nor its france-only to virtually everything you can think of ( * even maths get somewhat affected * ) . 
  so i applied for universities in denmark which is a country i really like and would love to get to know better , yet i fucked up massively with the optalgense system ( the system you use for college applications for denmark ) and basically none went through . 
  then i decided to quickly apply for the netherlands because that too is a country i love and would like to have more experience with , and jokingly applied to the uva ... 
  joke was soon over when i got accepted ( i was * not * expecting it jesus christ ) . 
  as for belgium ... eh , it 's there , and i 'll visit it some day ( probably soon actually ) . 
   about walking on sidewalks i think you need to come visit my village where sidewalks are for the flies and the road is for everything , cars , bikes , people , electric wheelchairs i have yet to go to france and to the netherlands , so i dont understand one thing ... 
  should n't they be way more organized than we ? 
  and why are malls designed in incomprehensive ways ? 
  is it like a way to force people to pass by more stores and buy more stuff ? 
  depends on what your perception of `` organized '' is , because for the french this is fully natural and normal , so it is organized . 
  also if you are french and ask for a passport/id card , you will see the amazing french bureaucracy at work that for my fragile portuguese mind was too overly complex and needlessly inconsistent ( i spent 5 years in france with no access to french healthcare because of a fucking bureaucratic loop , vive la r\u00e9publique ... ) . 
   where do you feel at home ? 
  where do you feel like you belong ? 
  mainly in the netherlands now , i feel the happiest living here . 
  i still feel at home whenever i go to portugal and france , but i feel like * right now * my house is here , my friends are here , my work is here ... 
  so my home is where my life is , regardless of geographic position . 
  not just any huge ass-boat , it was the * chosen * ass-boat . 
  the mighty saviour from the cheeto fuhrer . 
  and his name is ... * boaty mcboatface *, 
  ... nah , all copies were taken to area 51 . 
   so like liquid yoghurt but superior  ** shhhhhh ** do n't let the ghost of greece 's past hear you . 
  ura for kefir !, 
  i have n't found a polish shop in amsterdam but i am 90 % sure there 's one , there is definitely a russian one that is quite close to where i work though . 
  after an unfortunate accident involving ns , a monkey , two swedish meatballs , twelve krokets , and a huge ass boat , yes . 
  * occupied ireland , 
  ... boats ? 
  well maybe not , considering the quantities of stock ... :(, 
  oooooooh , okay that sounds more reasonable , so it 's basically cheese before it 's cheese ? 
  a cheese fetus thing ? 
  i really wan na try some now , i 'll try to find some at a russian delicacy store or something . 
  that soup looks actually really tasty , i want some , especially with eggs . 
  that sounds ... unhealthy , it 's basically spoiled milk ? 
  why would you drink that , moreover ... ** why would you have spoiled milk with pork sausages and baked potatoes ** god fucking damnit now i need to go to the baltics to learn all this crap ... 
  what 's kefir though ? 
  in nearly all languages it 's something that sounds similar to czechia , and for me it seems weird to call it * the czech republic * because i nearly never call france * the french republic * and i sure as hell do n't call britain * the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland * furthermore , in some academic essays in my university , we need a distinction between the conventional country ( the land where the czechs live basically ) and the state of that country . 
  this makes czechia and the czech republic two terms that , under special occasions , refer to two different things . 
  why not , republic of slovenia ? 
  how did school compare ? 
  were there noticeable differences in the way schools work ? 
  what was the reaction of people towards western products after the fall ? 
   and algeria of course ... ** merde pas encore **, 
  that would probably be the biggest culture shock if i ever went to eesti i think . 
  i 've never seen that , though i 've seen soap in bags ( you put the soap in the regular hard plastic case it comes in , to avoid wastage ) how do you open it though ? 
  wo n't they just mess up if kept near something sharp enough ? 
  i have so many questions about this . 
  ... * the fuck ? 
  * why would milk be in a bag ? 
  it 's a liquid, 
  our rednecks sorta just gathered up in their region and gave it a new name for some reason , they call that weird backwards place with shite roads `` belgium '' . 
  that sounds horrible , i 'm sorry he had to go through that . 
  where was this ? 
  what types of restrictions did your grandfather face due to his branding ?
