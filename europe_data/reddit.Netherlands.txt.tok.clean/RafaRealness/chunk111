  i wan na visit a bunch of them , mainly north korea , kazakhstan , australia , japan , singapore , the us , and brazil . 
  it is n't a country but it 's not in europe , so i guess that greenland counts ? 
  * fake dutch, 
  what was money like ? 
  i imagine that between communism and free-market , money had a different role . 
   interesting !, 
  and what was your conclusion when you changed ? 
  is france better than us in terms of education ? 
  my conclusion that although the basic public education is not necessarily * waaay better * , there are certain options that i was pretty shocked were not a thing in portugal ( i did [ this ] ( http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid20999/l-option-internationale-du-baccalaureat-o.i.b.html ) in uk english ) . 
   why would you want kebabs when you can get bifanas or p\u00e3o com chouri\u00e7a ? 
   i 'm all about that bacalhau com natas thoooo  my mother grew up when france like almost everyone else from leiria but the way she tells it its like portugal is way better because there is more freedom to walk around in the streets this is something i notice everywhere i go and i think it has to do with density as well the most subtle difference i still rage over about : walking speed and sidewalk culture . 
  you see , in france , everything seems much more dense as those places have a fuck tonne more tourists and certain places ( especially malls ) are not designed the same as in portugal ( malls in portugal are usually more of a circular system with hallways reaching out , whereas the french one is a huge corridor with branches ) , making already by design a bit harder to move around with more people . 
  furthermore , in portugal there is a very very very repeating tendency to walk on the left of the sidewalk always , yet in france ( and amsterdam ) that have way smaller sidewalks this is n't a thing at all , plus they tend to walk ever so slightly slowly . 
  it is ** the ** smallest teeny tiniest thing yet i for some reason am still not 100 % used to it . 
   currently she claims to not remember french anymore but its weird since she only spoke french until she was 10 and sometimes you 'll catch her pronouncing `` talento '' as `` talant '' my mom grew up in france until her teen years and never really stopped speaking french , however she noticed that when i speak french ( because i learned it much later ) i speak perfectly like a french person would * except * with some numbers or some expressions ( i sometimes call the 70 , 80 , and 90 , in the swiss/belgian versions because they make more sense to me ) . 
  i went to school in both countries , i was born n raised in portugal , and moved to france in 2011 ( left in 2016 ) . 
  i actually moved to france * specifically * for school ( i was really demotivated and disappointed in public education in portugal and wanted better ) . 
  yep !, 
  there are tonnes of small but noticeable differences here and there . 
  i also think that the kebab oddly enough is * far * more popular in france and the netherlands than it is in portugal ( i know exactly * one * place that sells them there ... ), 
  i think that in terms of everyday living and the expectations of social norms they tend to be very similar everywhere you go in europe . 
  the thing that * did * definitely surprise me and i noticed a gap between cultures is how some parts of history are seen . 
  in france , napoleon is praised as this great man who made france great again , and in portugal he 's a dick who invaded everything and made our king run away to brazil ( oh god why ) what is sometimes acceptable to eat changes a bit as well , like how the dutch eat just a dainty little sandwich for lunch yet in portugal it 's usually an actual meal with desert and whatnot . 
  i would say that the degree of difference is identical actually . 
  french and dutch culture are more related and close to each other than they are to portuguese culture , but still remain quite close . 
  the sole big difference that might make a difference is that dutch is a germanic language so it is less intelligible to the average portuguese speaker than french is . 
  i 'm portuguese , dated a french guy , it went really well , culture was not at all a barrier , and we just lightly joked about it on occasion . 
  also dated a dutch dude , again , went really well , culture never was a problem , or even * a thing * . 
  both my experiences were basically the exact same as dating someone within my own culture , no real barrier at all or even a change . 
  [ * bonjour * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1et8zrzyyq ), 
  depends on where in western europe , and who you are . 
  if you are an eu citizen ( or norwegian , or swiss , or icelandic ; with some exceptions for croatians until maximum 30 of june 2020 , and with limited quotas for liechtenstein ) you can work and go anywhere in western europe you wish without requiring any additional documentation ( just the local regular documentation * everybody * must follow in the member state ) . 
  if you are * not * an eu citizen ( nor norwegian , nor swiss , nor icelandic ) you will require a working permit . 
  to do so you must address yourself to the embassy of your the member state you are trying to work in ( for example the netherlands ) and file your documentation there as a freelancing expat . 
  if you happen to be an american , australian , new zealander , or canadian citizen , you can * reside * freely in the eu for up to 90 days in the schengen area , and also file your application in europe itself instead of an embassy . 
  for the uk and ireland , terms and conditions for visas may vary as they are not part of schengen , furthermore for the uk , due to their departure of the eu , this all can easily change . 
  unless the mightiest and finest quality newspapers : the sun and the daily mail , they will know everything about it !, 
  this , plus made in germany for electric domestic stuff like vacuum cleaners . 
  ... no because the same can be said about any religion , and banning a religion is against human rights itself . 
  you ban the break of human rights , of women 's rights , of state-church separation , and discrimination against other religions . 
  punish criminals for being criminals and let the muslims/christians/jews who do n't bother anyone practice their own religion . 
  christiania seems like fun neighbors to be fair , hehe . 
  ... speaking of high ... how 's christiania doing ? 
   like if you want to hike in mountains i 'd probably not recommend the netherlands . 
  malta has lots of stuff in english , france has france 24 in english , dw also is in english from germany , russia has rt , and ... yeah i think that pretty much covers it . 
   penaut butter * offended in dutch *, 
   worse opinion of america than it ever had under bush . 
  grim but true , i mean , * bush * was something else ... 
  nah , you 'll likely just have to present your cart\u00e3o do cidad\u00e3o or your passport , and they will just let you through on your merry way . 
  well it 's not like norway was forced to join the eea . 
  if you dislike it , feel free to leave , that 's your own government 's issue . 
  ... we did n't tho , weed is still technically illegal . 
  they are * decriminalized * but does not mean they are by any means of the word legal , they are basically as legal as they are in portugal . 
  about portugal : yes we * are * hairier on average than most french/dutch people . 
  that one is surprisingly true in my experience . 
  * exactly . 
  i 'm genuinely confused ? 
  just gon na relax at home , do some assignments , and perhaps go buy a trimmer . 
   we say it like `` quarante-cinq euros vingt '' and `` deux euros quarante '' . 
  same thing : shameless reality tv idiotic cheeto-person with a loudmouth who * looooves * to tell lies and flip sides more than a pancake and italy in a world war combined . 
  same exact thing . 
   what do you do for a living ? 
  i 'm working on my bachelor 's in european studies ( and russian ! ), 
   do you like it ? 
  ** love it **  how long have you been at that job ? 
  i think around 9 or 10 months now , i 'm not sure . 
  depends on what language , but * in general * i just watch my favorite shows in that language . 
  i start off by kids ' shows to get the basis and speak correctly ( the nearly always speak a very correct version of the language ) then i start reading simple news articles ( also i switch the language options on everything i have to my target language , small things help ! ), 
  and cruise around subreddits in that language . 
  when i feel confident enough , i try to watch less-correct stuff to get acquainted with coloquial expressions ( big brother helps in my experience ) . 
  try talking with yourself in that language too !, 
  always helpful . 
  that 's actually really interesting !, 
  i had no idea how it all came about . 
  thanks !, 
  i need to start making a whole research about terminology for this , seriously how do all languages overcomplicate this one dude in the bible ? 
  ooooh , makes sense , so fan is more like the grand high lucifer bitch himself , and dj\u00e4vel is more of a lower demon devil thingy ? 
  i myself am quite fond of the d ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) edit : how is devil fan but devils ( plural ) dj\u00e4vlar ? 
  allow me to be the overly direct dutch to your canadian kindness and for those confused : * gypsie * rhymes with poughkeepsie . 
  not trying to be a cunt , i genuinely was confused for like two minutes until i realized . 
  so this is just to clear it up . 
   ( d ) j\u00e4vlar is the d optional ? 
  not to mention we like to mix kut with everything , even nonsensical shit like kutwout , kutwijf , etc. . . 
   and all we 're supposed to be getting in return is more dudes . 
  :d ... i mean , considering the quality gay porn that prague alone produces , i 'd say it 's a pretty sweet damn deal ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  [ well , i guess ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k7n92a1dum ), 
  funny fact : the escudo was also informally called the pau ( among youngsters mainly ) and 1000 $ was called a conto . 
  when the euro came about , a common joke is that portugal lost 3 currencies : the escudo , the pau , and the conto . 
   that alright i guess but i think it becomes silly when children also gets two last names . 
  me and everybody from my country has two last names , i do n't really find it silly in the least . 
  names using \u00e5 \u00e4 \u00f6 are just as silly if you look at it that way . 
  in portugal , having two last names ( or more ) is super common ... because your name looks like this : [ given name ] + [ mother 's middle & family names ] + [ father 's middle & family names ] usually the last one is your common family name , and everything else is just use whenever you really need your full name ; plus they never get that long because if they do we just take one name per parent ( which is what happened to me ) . 
  when you get married , you take the * last * name of your beloved one ( if you * choose * to do so , my parents did n't see the point of it in the least ) in the last spot , that 's it . 
  when i moved to france my middle name became part of my last names , like , i just had a long last name that happened to be two names . 
  i think you are right and there is a distinction between what you are called , however you still can not legally demand your name to be treated differently should all other legal documentation you have not declare it 's your called name . 
  there are lots of distinctions and adaptations depending on country ( for example patronymics from russia , ukraine , bulgaria , etc. . . are considered last names or middle names depending on where you go to ), 
  an eu passport does not exist , what * does * exist are some design guidelines that are followed . 
  you can not really ask for your name to be different than it actually is so if your middle names are not your first name then they can not be treated as such * legally * and a passport is a legal document so ... you 'd need a name change first . 
  keep in mind that the eu has 28 ( soon to be 27 ) countries within it and [ with the exception of portugal , spain , hungary , bulgaria , cyprus , and greece , all countries have no real `` middle name '' system ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rwbkara.png ),
