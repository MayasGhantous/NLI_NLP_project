  in fact i 'm pretty sure that is one of the smaller reasons . 
  it 's the sacred gay bible . 
  i 'd think so but 99 % of the tourists are just visiting and being rude to the workers ( both the sex workers and the coffeeshop staff ) . 
  everywhere we stress the rules for these places yet these go unfollowed ... 
  this is not r/europe , this is r/askeurope . 
  furthermore i still have no understanding why you care for the euro to be used between a british replier and an american questioner . 
  the euro may be useful to reply to a european that uses it , but not to someone who does not . 
  if this thread was asked by a russian , we 'd probably just use the rub and the gbp . 
  what qualifies as blond and brown though ? 
  but i 'd say that seems pretty accurate based on what i see . 
  ... are you a secret switzerland ? 
  goddamnit now i like ireland even more . 
   either abolishing our monarchy well , yeah , do n't talk shit about willem , he 's cool . 
   saying anything negative about zwarte piet . 
  *** reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ***, 
  that makes sense , though they could also make it mandatory for either gender but work on a quota-based system . 
  the most willing and fittest to participate would be requested to do so , whereas the less fit would be given another meaningful `` coming of age '' element . 
  what is the austrian military service like ? 
  so basically this is all based in a nonsensical old convention then . 
  it is not a conventional ball , so to call it foot * ball * makes no conventional sense . 
  it may have had history and origins , however that is true for a multitude of words that were dropped , replaced , or even changed . 
  i think he means the original france , germany , benelux , and italy states . 
  those are the ones whom have funded the basic blocks of the european institutions . 
  they are pretty common , though i have no official statistics . 
  it 's pretty normal and standard , though other people who do n't have those features are also very numerous and do n't particularly stand out . 
  i 'd say maybe a third of the dutch population has it ? 
  i really am not sure . 
  ** since when is a prolate spheroid considered a ball ** [ ceci n'est pas un ballon ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_x3ybofvuadm/ttxefkpxvpi/aaaaaaaaczg/ozf1ja-9uak/s1600/800px-cfl_football.jpg ), 
  * ball * . 
  in the netherlands * i think * it would require an overwhelming support in the tweede kamer , and the sole one dude seriously proposing it ( well , as serious as this muppit can be ) is geert wilders whom does n't have support of anything . 
  geert wilders calls for a nexit referendum , so i 'd imagine so . 
  however i do n't know if there is any * legal * mandate stating that an exit is only valid if there is referenda of any kind . 
   like `` it 's cool that the guys have to do it , but why should i do it , you know i 'm a girl , right ? '', 
  and then 5 mins later they talk about how women are always discriminated against and how there need to be equal rights and equal obligations for everyone . 
  what is mandatory military service like ? 
  i 've never done it and i 'm pretty curious about it . 
  which begs the question : ** why are all these sports that are not that similar and do n't even use balls called football ? 
  and rugby is n't called football . 
  [ here 's the most recent relevant polls !, 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c-h3icgw0ae-ext.jpg ) as you can see , there is 62 % of m\u00e9lenchon voters that prefer macron , 9 % that prefer lepen , and 29 % that did not express themselves . 
  ball though ? 
  it uses a pointy egg leather thing . 
  perhaps in the future i guess . 
   i 'd say lgbt rights . 
  why is this a `` third rail '' issue for austria ? 
   what 's the rules on coverage in france there with different parties ? 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't really know what you mean , i remember seeing a poll demonstrating airtime that the candidates got , fillon by far got the most ( by the reason you probably can guess ) and i think lepen was second , and finally macron third . 
   after the basics the coverage i 've seen has then either been fillon ( for all the wrong reasons ) ** rends l'argent **  i think it was the beeb who even sent a french speaking reporter to interview her , which i think is a first for uk news . 
  i do n't think it 's the first time a reporter talked to a french politician for a uk source , but with lepen it probably is the case . 
  after all , she relatively recently became leader of the fn and as the nationalist politicians seem to be on rise on she 'd be a person of interest . 
  i remember her being referred as `` may 's embarassing fan '' because lepen is remarkably disliked ( often with good reason in my opinion ) yet as soon as may came to power in the uk she tried to milk the situation . 
  how come this is an issue in austria ? 
  like , what 's the debate about it like ? 
  i 'm not dutch actually , i 've only lived over here for about a year . 
  even from the outside i never understood why it 's so immensely hyped , especially when just in amsterdam alone there 's so much better stuff that often goes unnoticed . 
  it 's not , i fail to see why everyone 's so hyped about it . 
  i still wonder how the two are called `` football '' to begin with , they are nearly entirely different sports . 
   madame tussauds i walk by it every day , and every day it 's packed and does n't let nor me nor * bikes * peacefully walk past it . 
  ** who the hell decided to build it on a street with a tiny sidewalk right on damsquare !? 
  fillon is n't that far-right , and as polls come through , he wo n't make it into the 2nd round . 
  as for lepen , thus far she has roughly 20 % of the vote , which is roughly the same abstention amount estimate . 
  she is getting through the 2nd round along with macron . 
  interestingly , the last time the fn ( lepen 's party ) ever got into the 2nd round they lost with a mere 8 % of the vote . 
  it 's very much likely that macron will win , plus remember that the american system allowed trump to be president * without * the popular vote , whereas in france that 's impossible . 
  in my opinion , i do n't think that even lepen is as bad as * trump * , and considering my utter distaste for her politics , trust me when i say that it takes quite a bit to admit there 's someone worse . 
  99 % of the tourists just go there to look at the girls , some are disgusting and disrespectful and try to take pictures ( * huge * no-no ), 
  weed and the red light district . 
  ** seriously for fuck 's sake what 's so damn great about that ??? 
  i can answer you with a 3rd option that is * the * most annoying american i 've ever met : `` europe is a perfect soviet socialist country , proof that communism works ! '', 
  i. shit you . 
  not . 
  but to answer your question i think it 's more annoying to be called a soviet shithole wasteland ( though i think that 's a problem more attributed to the former eastern bloc , western europe tends to get the `` perfect socialist wonderland '' treatment ) . 
  never said the contrary . 
  but if you 're going to source any linguistic facts then at least use better sources than * huffington post and business insider * . 
  as i see it : the english may have originated the term , but they no longer use it , and it still remains a bastardization which americans keep using , so when it comes to the word it 's as if america is stuck in the 19th century :') to answer the question you wrote as the title : seems to be an unknown fact , does n't really change anyone 's minds about its usage . 
  a business news website trying to talk about linguistics ? 
  try again . 
  [ here 's a better source ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/whats-the-origin-of-the-word-soccer ) for the origin of english vocabulary . 
  turns out it 's just a bastardization of association football into assoc + er ( soccer ), 
  * mind if i join the mix ? 
   proof  huffpo i would n't trust them with a single piece of cereal . 
  does your username check out ? 
  if so i 'm actually impressed . 
  [ here 's what i consider ideal , though i want to tweak it in order to have a surplus , or at least no deficit in the least ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yljfw ), 
  * i cringed then and i still cringe now * worst part is i used to live in this really bad neighborhood in idf full of people like those , ugh . 
  and in comparison to stalin , you could argue that mao was n't all that bad . 
  comparisons of the lesser of two evils are quite useless because you are comparing people whom have constantly repressed their populations and put thousands through hell and back . 
  he was a vile man , so were the henneicke column . 
  my grandparents suffered quite a fair bit under salazar and so did everyone who had the misfortune to ever live under nazism . 
  but i guess that we can always look up to hitler because of his vegetarianism . 
  salazar was n't even that great with refugees , considering how he sent most of them away and openly did n't want shit to do with them , it was no secret they were unwelcome in portugal during the war . 
  i had that same reaction , i just looked at my mom like `` mais de quoi il parle celui la. . . '' ... i guess about the r\u00e9publique being delicious . 
  une double portion de frites ! '', 
  edit : i saw a poster of marine with `` va deja chez le juge '' written on it , by god i hope it becomes a thing . 
   especially for his work ethic  especially how he helped refugees during the war .
