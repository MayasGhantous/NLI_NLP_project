   while in portugal : `` would you say portugal is a lot like spain ? '', 
  ** how . 
  dare . 
  you . 
  ... okay , ladies and gentlemen i think we can all agree to pass the triggernometry prize of 2017 to u/outrageous _ chausette, 
  no ... but now that you mention it i should totes as fuck design one . 
  * i 'd feel so fancy and noble and shit *, 
  / thread . 
  ... the uk ( which is the flair the poster of the comment you 're referring to ) poland , denmark , sweden , czechia , romania , bulgaria , hungary and croatia do not use the euro . 
  so already within the eu we see that only 19 of the 28 ( soon to be 27 ) countries use it . 
  furthermore r/askeurope is for * all * europe , not only the eu , so we 'd also count serbia , russia , switzerland , iceland , bosnia & herzegovina , macedonia , albania , ( kosovo depending on your opinion on the matter ) , belarus , ukraine , moldova , montenegro ... 
  although the euro is a very big chunk of currency use in europe , it is not at all the end-all-be-all for europe , and i fail to see why you 'd want to apply eur conversions for a british answer ( gbp ) to an american question ( usd ) . 
  aaah , alright . 
  thanks for clarifying !, 
  an american asked the question , so it makes sense to include an usd conversion to avoid confusion . 
  ooooh , alright thanks !, 
   left iraq because spaniards didnt suport whst its governament did ... i actually do n't understand what you are saying . 
  whst ? 
  rtp is a public tv channel whose shows are mainly watched by older people . 
  trust me when i say that the tv quality in rtp is poorer than tanzania ... 
  so the poll conducted is extremely focused on a low-end or easily influentiable group of older citizens . 
  salazar did quite a bit of good for our country , however we still remember the roughness of times under him , especially when it comes to freedom of expression and such . 
   outfit you wear ? 
  casual grey/black stuff in different tone . 
  the simpler the better . 
   meal you eat for lunch or in general ( including beverages ) ? 
  a sandwich or a wrap , usually with salad , cherry tomatoes , goat cheese , etc. . .  thing you get annoyed about ? 
  tourists or poor administration  mood you find yourself to be in ? 
  happy !, 
   thing you say irl or online without meaning it ( i.e. 
  `` fuck/shit '' in whatever language i happent to say it in  small mistake you make in general be too loud , sometimes unknowingly rude . 
  happened to me in berlin as well . 
   chauvinism unfortunately for me , i met some people in my life that believed that anybody who did n't act french was a vile creature to be eradicated , something unnatural and unwelcome ; and of course , they protected all their ideas in tainted french nationalism . 
  they tarnished the love many have for the french national elements and instead deterred it for aspirations of deportations and `` purification '' . 
  chauvinism is just one example in my opinion , but it is what most stroke me . 
  not really considering that the vote is directly taken into the european parliament and whatever your own national parliament arrangement is ( just compare the dutch and the british systems ) the european parliament has its own attribution system . 
  if you think that the european parliament is undemocratic , then so is your own national parliament , as they both work in the same exact basis . 
  nationalism is a nice warming idea that can bring many benefits in terms of social and national identity . 
  however i think that too often in history and in our current days it gets hijacked to support other ideas that i disagree with , chauvinism comes to mind . 
  nationalism is not inherently bad , but by god it 's very used for other purposes that deteriorate and tarnish its reputation . 
  ... do you know how laws are passed in the eu ? 
  they need approval of the council of ministers , aka ** your own ministers ** and also the european parliament ** which you directly elect ** not to mention that all legislation is proposed by the commission ( built up by members that are nominated by their own national government ) and have to follow the agenda set by the european council which is made up of ** your own national leaders ** . 
  there are no mystical bureaucrats , it 's our own governments and votes at work . 
  i am very passionate about the eu for a lot of reasons . 
  at first there was nothing but ruins in europe , and tensions were still lingering after decades upon decades of conflict , but through orderly cooperation to get back on our feet we 've established peace and had a speedy recover . 
  then we decided we wanted to go as far as we can , not by having constant state vs state competition , but instead opening up our economies to each other , create a single market , and truly become a productive and empowered continent . 
  we then faced problems on maintaining it , because of constant problems for european consumers like different standards for higher education or currency fluctuations , and for the sake of our efficiency and our progress towards efficiency , we 've resolved those . 
  being an eu citizen , i 've seen countries ' standards for products and practices go up , borders welcoming me to travel freely , and a secure feeling about my future for i am not bound to one small portion of the continent , but i am free to go wherever i am wanted . 
  the eu gave me and my family a chance at a far better life , and keeps on striving to do so for its citizens . 
  it still has problems , that is absolutely undeniable , but i believe that we can solve them and again we will see our continent grow into beauty as it 's been doing since we 've ended ww2 . 
  ** you have been warned **, 
  very easy : on the pin machine you just put your card on the screen . 
  the screen on the top right corner has 4 tiny icons , once all are lit ( like , a second ) you can take it off ( it also lets out a beep for the duration you need to leave it there , it 's all super quick ) then you may take it back and bam . 
  done , you paid . 
  ( you can also pay with nfc on your phone via your bank 's app ) this obviously arose some big questions regarding safety , but on your account online ( or the bank 's app ) you can set limits on contactless pin ( daily amount , maximum one-time amount , etc. . . ) or even fully disable it . 
  we have it all over , but not on stuff that takes coins ( it 's more of a problem than it seems i swear ! ), 
  so it would be awesome to pay ** only ** by contactless pin . 
  i used to be super sceptical about the whole card-only lifestyle , and contactless pin ( when i got here i used cash money for everything like a barbarian ) and now i can not stress how much better it is .

  plus the former portuguese colonies , culturally and socially i feel like they are bros of portugal so . 
  i thought it was a reference to daesh as in the word that means basically an idiot that forces its beliefs on others or crushing something depending on how it 's derived, 
   media globalization means that european cops and criminals are more aggressive than before as they 're under american influence no idea what type of brain came up with this , but i can assure you that this is not at all a thing . 
   daesh uses very similar `` tactics '' to american street thugs ( attempting to disarm law enforcement , driving cars at cops or crowds ) daesh ( no need for full caps , it 's not an acronym ) usually is far far more concerned with killing a maximum number of people . 
  the endgoal they have is not just to kill and disarm cops , their endgoal is to kill us and spread a grip of terror to support a political and ideological agenda , they are coordinated ; american thugs on the other hand are far less coordinated than an international terror organization . 
   more americans have access to real and realistic guns as well as to automobiles that is true for guns , it is less complicated to gain access to them in the us than it is in a very big part of europe ; though i believe that the problem is not access but discipline and education , because switzerland has a higher access to activated guns yet does not have a big problem yet honduras does . 
  as for cars , we have them as well , they are just not as massive . 
   the lack of a welfare state and public healthcare means that americans are more likely to behave erratically / `` crazily '' compared to western and central europeans i believe you mean the lack of access of psychological care and reintegration into society can cause certain individuals to feel pushed off the edge and desperate ; this mixed with an easier access to firearms can cause significant damages . 
  i think that this may be part of the reason , but there are far more underlying causes besides lack of mental support  in other words , if your country 's cops were assigned to police american streets or if american criminals began arriving in europe , do you think that the use of force would normalize towards american levels ? 
  i believe that our police forces are extremely different , and i can not predict how the european general police force behavior would be received by american societies , especially since i do not fully understand some current tensions like racial issues in the us . 
  my italian friend said that they say `` fare il portoghese '' ( to `` do the portuguese '' ) which means leaving without paying . 
  how about a l33t haxxor ? 
  i know multiple ones , i did quite a lot of research about my options before i made a decision , and i 'm doing an undergraduate programme in english right now . 
  the uk elections apply to the uk , which means that scotland will vote as well . 
  scotland is a devolved power of the uk so it also has its own competent entities such as the scottish parliament which england ( for the most part ) does not compared to wales , northern ireland ... 
  let me know if you have any questions regarding education in the netherlands , i 'm always happy to help !, 
  tha ... hold up , so basically the french one is * both * the father and the mother ... 
  i am blown away . 
  they ? 
  ( a ) p\u00e1tria is the portuguese word for it , and considering it 's a feminine noun , i 'd say for portugal it 's * likely * motherland . 
  m\u00e8re patrie is the french version of it , so it is really damn obvious it would be motherland . 
  the netherlands usually says vaderland so it 's fatherland . 
  maybe it 's a latin/germanic split ? 
  and english ( as usual ) is the odd one out since it even uses * french * words so whatever goes . 
  i personally prefer mentioning homeland as it all makes far more sense to me . 
  a country does not really have a gender to me , but it can be something special to you : * home * . 
   unfortunately , it 's true that most of the ` english courses ' are master 's programs . 
  that can also be due to the fact that most of the * courses * are master 's programmes , besides , some countries do n't have bachelor 's courses in english ( ie sweden ) . 
   how do you mean `` housing assistance '' ? 
  real estate can be * very * tricky here in the netherlands , so if you are a student , you can very easily subscribe to studentwoning.nl and , should your university provide it , take housing from duwo or de key ( companies that provide student housing , either 1-year deals or full residence ) . 
  i highly suggest studentwoning.nl as it allows you to access far better rooms the more you wait , with very attractive prices and locations . 
  but it 's a waiting game , so make sure that you contact your university to know the options available and carefully find adequate housing . 
  i have not idea for polish to be honest ( though i seriously believe it is very similar ) , however in russian ( the slavic language i study ) it mainly depends on the ending . 
  patronymics are standard in russian names for example , so if your name is , let 's say , ivan ( \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d ) and your father 's name is alexander ( \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 ) then your patronymic would be \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 . 
  for last names , that come after the patronymic , it very common for names to change accordingly ( sometimes the same exact way as patronymics if they happen to have the same - \u0438\u0447 or - \u0432\u043d\u0430 endings ) , for example , the name averyanov ( \u0410\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044c\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0432 ) is averyanova ( \u0410\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044c\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 ) for feminine entities . 
  anna is feminine and jan is masculine , and * some * names in slavic languages are sensitive to their subject . 
  yep , yep , yep on all marks . 
  there are a few americans in my university ( mainly exchanges and master 's degrees ) and they pretty much love it here . 
  it is an extremely international atmosphere no matter what course you choose really ( unless you go for the dutch course , which my guess would be that it includes more dutch students ) .
