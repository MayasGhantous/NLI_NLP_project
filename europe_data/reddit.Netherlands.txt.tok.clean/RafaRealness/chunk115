  it is an idea that has inspired hundreds , if not thousands , of americans to study over here ; and to get a good place in the netherlands as a student : ** get every single housing assistance you can because believe me you will need it ** i 'm not joking , especially for amterdam . 
  congratulations on getting hitched !, 
  hope you enjoy your honeymoon . 
  portugal : i love them , they are basically our cousins , sure they are n't perfect but they are still family regardless . 
  france : ehh ... * new phone who dis ? 
  * sure we are still very much in touch but i think that the relationship has definitely not been * that * great , but still , a good cooperative relationship . 
  the netherlands : they are n't really brothers but more like very very close friends , i like them and i think that it 's awesome that we get to have closer cooperation with them . 
  for me it always comes to this : cooperation  domination, 
  ... i have been sitting here for 5 minutes , i am pretty sure i can evoke * anything * where i am ... 
  i mean , maybe not caviar or some very specific thing like that , but i got ribs , pizza , burgers , kroketten , chinese , sushi , etc. . . all available here , even some very good surinamese food . 
  ** guess it 's necessary when we get the munchies **, 
  huh , til . 
  that 's actually something very interesting . 
  mainly what i know about portuguese migration history is the 70s migrations towards france . 
  ... in the name of the portuguese republic i claim all of new england as the second portuguese empire . 
  we emigrated there then , we still do it now , and we like it so unless the cheeto f\u00fchrer bans us we 'll likely continue . 
  i think that due to portugal 's political and economic woes ( disproportionate wealth distribution , unstable toppling , then salazar also came along , etc. . . ) many portuguese people seeked refuge in the us in hopes of wealth and a better life . 
  in my opinion , portugal has been through some tough shit during its dictatorship which spanned for quite a damn long time , and its previous form was n't at all something to brag about either ; mainly talking about freedoms and economy mainly . 
  i have no idea what the general makeup of who left for the us was but my best guess would be wealthier classes that did n't agree with the status quo . 
  i cook every single day , nearly all of my meals too . 
  every dinner pretty much and about a third of my lunches . 
  the two countries are low key a little bit connected , and i have no clue for the life of me as to * why * but yeah . 
  ukraine is even an interested state of the cplp ( along with a few others , i do n't know why ) . 
  i 've been to taiwan and australia , both lovely places !, 
  i 'm really hoping i manage to visit kazakhstan one day , as well as south korea and the usa . 
  i think there is also some certain reactions to some events that are expected . 
  my dutch friends think i 'm very weird for loving the amsterdam metro system , and never really complain when it 's delayed ( it 's just a few minutes , does n't matter to me ) but for them it is ** inadmissible and entirely unacceptable ** and such . 
  so i think that there are some parts that even though very subjective , still are an element on what makes you stand out or not . 
  edit : and do n't be visibly religious ( no matter what religion ) , dutch people keep religion to themselves, 
  / thread ? 
  still dutch ? 
  [ relevant . 
  ] ( https://satwcomic.com/buckle-up ), 
  yep , that too . 
  in my limited experience , i think parisian ( not all french , * parisians in particular * ) are the most chaotic drivers . 
  traffic lights are a mere suggestion and so are speed limits . 
  some people from the north call it something else that i ca n't remember . 
  [ and there 's always the alfacinhas vs tripeiros thing ] ( http://www.vortexmag.net/alfacinhas-vs-tripeiros-as-diferencas-na-linguagem/ ), 
  i 've never really talked about memes with anyone up north , so i would n't know . 
  i * did * notice that the north has some different words for some stuff , like ** cabide ** . 
  i hear people say it like `` m\u00edme '' all the time in lisbon though . 
  nearly nobody i know around my age group ( i 'm 20 and feeling so damn old ) that lives alone actually bothered to get a tv , or has one but never uses it by themselves . 
  mine is just used as a glorified monitor with speakers to be honest , it 's rare that i actually want to watch tv on it rather than just netflix my way into procrastination . 
  *** i am writing this as an immigrant myself so for all that is orange take what i say with a pinch of salt ***  have people assimilated ? 
  nearly everyone from the former dutch colonies seems to have assimilated very well , and as for eu citizens , the same story goes ( except for amsterdam where you notice a lot of expats , mainly from the eu and north america , that live in the expat bubble ) . 
  the north african and turkish immigrants seem to pose more of a problem related to integration . 
  there are statistics that show that moroccans , tunisians , turks , etc. . . are by far over represented in incarceration percentages and a lot of them do not accept basic dutch values . 
   do you want more/less immigration ? 
  keep migration just the same ** but ** focus on intra-eu migration first and then open the door primarily to more developed countries , with more restrict and controlled access from poorer parts of the world . 
   from which country do you get most immigrants from ? 
  i think that the netherlands gets a lot of immigration from ~ ~ zuid brabant ~ ~ belgium , and also quite a bit from morocco , turkey , italy , ghana , and the former dutch colonies . 
  those seem to be * the * main groups . 
   who are the best/worst ? 
  never heard much about anyone from ghana , and when i asked about immigrants from the former colonies , some of my dutch friends told me that they basically just integrate seamlessly without much hassle . 
  eu citizens and north american citizens seem to be divided : the ones who * fully * integrate to the point you no longer really see them as a foreigner , and the ones who live in an expat bubble and just float around but do n't really disturb anyone . 
  then there are the turks and moroccans who seem to create the most agitation and tension among dutch society ( especially recently ) due to the turkish referendum problems , and also the big social questions of moroccans being a primary crime group statistically and forming small pocket communities that do not fit in with dutch society ; though for me it is a little bit unclear what are scare stories and what is factual truth , so i focus on data ( which only gets you so far unfortunately ) . 
   or are you an immigrant yourself ? 
  yep , hell , by now i might count as a travelling gypsy . 
  i moved from portugal to france , for high school ( portuguese public education took a huge nosedive and i wanted better opportunities ) then i came to the netherlands because i loved the place so much during a holiday and am currently in university . 
  the thing i think should be improved in the netherlands is the push to learn dutch and integrate ; because i see tonnes of people who merely do not feel motivated to do so ( not even learn dutch , which is free if you live here ) . 
   we : the english have the worst food . 
  i read this as some sort of declaration of independence act for some reason , it was pretty funny . 
  but as for your question ... ... crap . 
  i like everyone 's food ... 
  i think that the country that has the worst food might be malta in my opinion . 
  * really * not into traditional maltese cooking . 
  never really thought about it like that , but accurate . 
  food tastes amazing when you care less and eat more . 
  i 'm more of a hagelslag man myself . 
  well , not anymore , and it 's still a bit cold in my house . 
  the sun * liiieees *, 
  i 'd 100 % go for democracy without the shadow of a doubt . 
  take care of your teeth more carefully , study your potential medical expenditures if you do not , and ** keep democratic rule alive ** . 
  besides , what is stopping a democratic system from installing a dutch-style system ( that is a hybrid between public and private ) for its people considering we are free to elect whoever we want ? 
  i have met this girl who had a huge stutter , but honestly after like 5 minutes of conversation you just did n't care . 
  just let her speak and listen like anyone else . 
  ... just gon na put it out there : i see no mention of any irish people talking about ryanair . 
  * i think this speaks volumes . 
  carcavelos represeeeeeeent . 
  but mainly i go to lisboa or barreiro . 
  i 'm personally very passionate about both world wars and the communist age , so let 's say 1910-1995 ( some stuff i love reading about sorta happened a few years after the ussr but was directly linked to the communist age so i 'm counting it ), 
  i had to fact check this and yep , apparently it 's legal . 
  i think that is the term , but i 'm not sure . 
  drugs are decriminalized in portugal ( including far more than just weed ) but the * way * this decriminalization works in practice is very different , and i do n't have the more intricate details and limitations of the practical aspects of the netherlands yet . 
  i stand corrected , yes . 
  weed is n't legal in the netherlands , it 's basically just `` tolerated '' . 
  this weird myth i 've so heard in my homeland , apparently this odd unsavory iced cream material that supposedly just * falls * from the sky . 
  probably just some northern folks tale . 
  my pleasure !, 
  jesus , that dude got ** game ** . 
  smoke weed in front of the police . 
  been to berlin , was an awesome city , bit it was back in my primitive days when i paid by cash ... 
  evacuation time , i get off from here , not dealing with all this northern european problems some call `` snow '' . 
  * well hello there gorgeous ~ you know what would look good on you ? 
  nieuwehuis is what he meant , which is casa nova ( new house ) . 
  i 'm a gay male , and based on my personal experiences with my ( female ) friend 's complaining and such ... women . 
  probably my phone , i 'm always using it for random shit . 
  chatting , music , news , sometimes emergency research , games ... 
  as a flip flop wearer , i 'm good , i do n't mind . 
   that refers to third-country nationals man .
