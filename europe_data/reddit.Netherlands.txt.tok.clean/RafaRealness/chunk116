  and there was an annoucement regarding it saying that all of these checks now apply for * any citizen * made on the 7th of april 2017 that you keep forgetting about yet was linked in this thread * at least * 4 times already . 
   i really struggle to understand your motif here . 
  boredom . 
   i posted at least 2 different references corroborating my argument . 
  and i directed you * directly * to the policy file you keep forgetting to read which are the procedures to be taken themselves for passengers inbound for the schengen area as well as an announcement stating that these checks now apply for * any passenger regardless of citizenship * so i can not comprehend how you can not see this , at all . 
   anyway i edited my submission , thanks for your help . 
  you still have not addressed any of the legal paperwork provided and are still taking freedom of movement as a complete other entity . 
  security of the schengen external borders and freedom of movement are * two very different things * . 
   ** contactless  cash ** [ relevant comic strip ] ( https://satwcomic.com/new-world ) only in my experience , the netherlands is denmark and england is france . 
  edit : in france and portugal i never used nfc stuff to pay for anything , so it was a bit of a change when i arrived in the netherlands but easily i adapted . 
  when i went to this * one * restaurant that did n't take cards ... 
  i was personally offended . 
  ** how dare they ask me for cash money ? 
  what century is this ??? 
   well , i 'm sad you think of me that way because ( even though i might have my own opinion ) i 'm actually trying to figure out how the regulations work . 
  if you were , you 'd check the eu source websites yourself . 
   i 've been looking for a reputable source about all of this for some time and i 've only come across directive 2004/38/ec about freedom of movement of people . 
  yes , but that is about * freedom of movement * and not about schengen , because the two are two entirely different things . 
   the problem is there is no mention of schengen so it 's hard to understand whether the same rights apply to eu member states that are not part of schengen . 
  oh for the last possible time . 
  ** they do but schengen security also applies for any citizen of any citizenship ** , freedom of movement is * not * schengen otherwise romanians , bulgarians , brits , and the irish would not be able to live elsewhere in the eu ... freedom of movement is the fact that you can enter any country and live/work/study / etc. . . over there without the need for any visas or special documentation , it ** does not ** mean you are special and get to skip security once inbound into schengen space . 
  edit : after just ** 10 minutes ** of searching i found [ the procedures for third country nationals ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?qid=1492296730582&amp;uri=celex:32016r0399 ) which includes clausule 3 . a.iv under chapter ii :  verification regarding the point of departure and the destination of the third-country national concerned and the purpose of the intended stay , checking , if necessary , the corresponding supporting documents ; this , combined with the announcement that now these procedures apply to * any * passenger ( including eu citizens ) that are inbound to enter the schengen area from outside of it ( like you ) make asking for your boarding pass not only legal , but * required by law * . 
   first of all that post got rightfully removed and it should n't be even considered since i posted it before reaching the desk , because i was worried there were problems and they might not just be in malta . 
  an airport line worried you ? 
   second i 'm mad at people who abuse their power ( either because they 're incompetent or on purpose ) who more specifically ? 
   i believe ( but i might be wrong ) that a eu border office has no right to ask a eu citizen for a boarding pass or anything similar . 
  the new policy has entered effect and you were not aware of it and this is literally just one small question that is even asked when you travel inside the eu itself , for example my parents got the same question when they travelled to the uk and did n't even flinch . 
  you have yet to explain why this poses a problem to you , and why you believe that this is illegal . 
   i see lots of people saying i 'm wrong and yet no source on why , just citing schengen which is n't sufficient . 
  so quoting the schengen announcements and legal structure documents is not a source then ? 
  in that case nothing is a source , because if you refuse to accept that * the announcements and documents of the policies and treaties of schengen * are the source of the rule of law , then what do you believe in ? 
   i surely do n't see this happening in other subreddits ( i have other usernames ) . 
  then you are fully free to go to other subreddits , nobody forces you to stay on this one . 
  you asked r/askeurope a question and pretty much everyone has answered your question the same way , so europeans in this subreddit have a very strong consensus on the correct answer . 
  a subreddit full of europeans having a strong consensus about anything of this matter is pretty rare , so if you are having troubles with the answer , feel free to browse other subreddits . 
  i 've got plenty of time to waste to be fair . 
  you asked a question , i answered it . 
  welcome to r/askeurope, 
   please answer this question : can my entry be denied depending on which country i 'm coming from and whether i still have my boarding pass with me ? 
  ** the reason why you are asked to provide proof of your boarding details is to ensure you are not evading customs inspections and also to cross check you against relevant databases ( someone travelling to syria all the time while also being suspicious in an eu national database is going to ring some bells ) . 
   no for the love of god , the requirement is to undergo the same passport control as everyone else ( hence the scanning ) , not to ask for a boarding pass and where you are coming from . 
  i have several friends from outside schengen and none of them had ever to show a fucking boarding pass . 
  did they travel into a schengen area country that has implemented the new clauses of the schengen borders code of 7th of april 2017 ? 
  if not , then i do not see how they are at all a viable case . 
   do you genuinely think i 'm just an entitled prick who 's trying to get attention here ?? 
  what the hell . 
  yes . 
   as of today , member states are obliged to carry out systematic checks against relevant databases on eu citizens who are crossing the eu 's external borders , in addition to the systematic checks already being carried out on all third-country nationals entering the schengen zone . 
  it is a requirement as per the determined authorities of the schengen borders code which happens to have the backing of the schengen area member states . 
  what did you think the systematic checks were ? 
  flying from an eu country that is n't in the schengen area into it will not be a problem at all , just show them your boarding pass and off you 'll be on your merry way . 
  you have yet to explain how this is of any hindrance at all to you , and checking by your post history , especially your [ post ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/65ivss/from_bulgaria_to_malta_and_passport_control_is/ ) in r/europe that got removed about long lines in an airport , i 'm starting to think that you 're just mad at security and are trying to grab at something to have a * reason * to be mad at it . 
  i was asked to present my boarding passport in schiphol when i landed in 4 different occasions just like every single passenger around me and this was not an issue for anybody , so i extremely doubt that you presenting it * once * is a hindrance at all . 
  i 'm portuguese , i just moved , but i still go back quite often to visit people close to me . 
  i mainly go to lisbon , and everyone i know says it the english way . 
  christ almighty ... well , i 'm glad to see that they are still outnumbered , because the defense leagues ( from what i 've heard ) tend to create mass havoc and generate the exact opposite of defense . 
   so my entry can not be denied on the basis of where i 'm coming from so what 's the point of asking ? 
  it 's clearly implying that i might be prevented/restricted access depending on where i 'm coming from which is illegal for eu citizens . 
   ** you are not going to be denied entry this is a standard security check to see if you actually are presenting the correct travel document in the correct security checks ** . 
  you have [ a link by the migration & home affairs section of the commission ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/news/schengen-borders-code-systematic-checks-eu-citizens-crossing-external-schengen-borders_en ) that states the regular procedure is to be applied to ** everyone ** so no , it is n't ** illegal ** it is a ** requirement ** . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  bulgaria is in the eu . 
  as stated elsewhere in this thread . 
  eu borders = schengen , you were not travelling from schengen into schengen but from bulgaria into schengen . 
   you are confusing security checks and passport control , one is operated when boarding the flight ( and occasionally by customs at arrival ) , the other when landing at the destination . 
  asking for my boarding pass is irrelevant in the latter case . 
  no authority would have the right to check my luggage and deny me entry before customs ( after passport control ) so what you are saying does n't make much sense . 
  no it is not because you can ** land ** in an airport , then try to do away with the international line and go straight for the intra-eu one without declaring anything as a way of smuggling contraband . 
  ** this one check prevents such a thing ** . 
  at any airport you can be demanded to show your airports to security personnel at any given moment should the country you are in require it , because additional security measures are still highly nationalized , for example i was asked to show my passport in 4 occasions , 2 of which were technically not needed by the schengen border code but are a requirement in schiphol itself when a passenger ( no matter who ) is changing terminals . 
  you are not being asked to check your luggage , you are being asked to * show basic travel documentation * upon arrival . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
   i 'm glad you study eu law and regulations but i think you are either misunderstanding me or deliberately trying to win an argument that is n't really one ... 
  i have yet to understand why this affects you so deeply and why you think that you are above the law , especially when you start saying that this goes `` against our fundamental rights '' when in practice it does not ... you asked if this was a legal procedure by the border security at your airport of destination , the answer is : yes , this is a requirement for entering the schengen area regardless of citizenship . 
   it does n't matter how long it takes or the reason why they do it , it 's clearly not a requirement for entering a eu member state ** as said tonnes of times in this thread alone , this is now a requirement according to the schengen border code **  unless the recent regulations override the fundamental treaties that are at the very base of the eu ( which i seriously doubt ) . 
  freedom of movement is part of the sea , whereas the fundamental treaties of the eu predate it ... 
  the common market safeguards freedom of movement , but that was only completed in 1992 ... you seriously need to study european law , jesus christ . 
   how can you not understand that it 's stuff like this that triggers much bigger changes ? 
  the classic frog slowly boiling to death . 
  because that would be paranoia , this is * one simple question * that is often asked even within countries and nothing short of a standard . 
  do you seriously think that the eu itself would shoot itself on the foot and somehow start reinstating visas or something ? 
   how is asking for my boarding pass within the security checks for entering a country ? 
  well , this is a step necessary to know exactly where you are coming from and if you are good to go . 
  if you went through a domestic flight line unchecked with as much scrutiny because you are travelling within the eu ( so nothing to declare ) * but * you actually came from a non-intra-eu flight , then we 'd have quite a bit of a security breach possibility . 
  this ** one small question ** prevents it . 
   and by law they must guarantee entry in a eu state to a eu citizen . 
  if you are n't doing anything illegal then yes you can enter , but you still go through security just like * everybody * . 
  if i take a flight from brussels to madrid then i will still need to go through security even though my entry is guaranteed . 
  if i am taking that flight * and * i am also taking illegal materials with me ( say , drugs ) that i managed to sneak into zaventem airport , then again , we 'd have a problem . 
  you are guaranteed ** entry ** you are * not * entitled to security skips . 
   so even if i refused to show it nobody could have prevented me from entering anyway , so what 's the point ? 
  i mean , if you wan na have a nice chat with security next time , try doing that , tell us how it went . 
   i think you are overestimating the rights the border authorities have within the eu with respect to eu citizens . 
  luckily for me , i study eu law and regulations , so i do n't really need to care what you think . 
  he meant asking for your boarding pass/where you took off from initially . 
  they did n't used to do that to eu citizens but the law changed and now they do , no biggie though , takes like 10 seconds if anything . 
   why is everything in spain so complicated and is it one of the reasons for independence movements popping up left and right ? 
  spain is n't really that complicated , it 's just a quasi-federal state . 
  you have the spanish crown that basically unites all of spain , then the spanish government . 
  the spanish communities ( andalucia , galicia etc. . . ) all also have some powers at their disposal .
