  the reason why there are `` independence movements popping up left and right '' as you eloquently put it is mainly due to a dispute in identity , culture and economy ( for catalonia ) whereas the other independence movements in spain are basically dead nowadays . 
   also the spanish language is from castile so it 's castilian but it 's called spanish ? 
  that 's like calling the english language the `` british language '' because england is the most powerful country in the union . 
  [ take one deep look at this map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castilian_spanish#/media/file:castillian_dialects_in_spain.png ) and you will see that the castilian language has spread to nearly all of spain as the * one * language spoken , sure there are ** bilingual ** areas but spanish is the main language of spain . 
  by your logic we should start calling portuguese `` lusitanian '' and dutch `` batavian '' ... 
  whilst we are talking about klm , allow me to say the best goddamn joke any one of you has ever heard about the airline : why does the alphabet only have 23 letters nowadays ? 
  because klm flew away . 
  ^ ( please do n't kill me ), 
  does the english defense league count as one of them ? 
  i have n't heard much from them but the little i have is ehm ... yeah ... 
   afaik you are simply supposed to make sure the person on the document is the same handing it . 
  no , it really is not , security checks not only are extremely common but necessary . 
   and what if i only had my national id ? 
  how would they scan that ? 
  there are * several * ways to spot a fake id no matter what eu member state you are from . 
  they likely would follow protocol and make sure that your travel document is real and matches the passenger ( you ) . 
   he then proceeds to ask me where i 'm coming from ( another big no-no ) . 
  i politely tell him that he has no right to ask that and i 'm not obligated to answer . 
  he gets pissed and asks me to show my boarding pass and tells me that ( i quote ) `` we are now vetting all eu citizens coming from outside schengen '' ( what the boarding pass has to do with `` vetting '' i do n't know ) . 
  at my request of giving me more details about this he says `` the law changed last week '' . 
  he 's fully in his right to ask that though , and they are basically applying some standard security measures for * any * incoming passenger regardless of eu citizenship . 
  the law * did * change as well so i have yet to figure out how this is somehow a big deal to begin with , * it 's a simple question of showing the appropriate documents * . 
   is n't the whole point of having `` freedom of movement '' letting eu citizens enter the country freely unless there 's a threat to national security ? 
  the whole point of freedom of movement is that you can legally reside , work , study , etc. . . wherever you wish within the eu without needing a visa or further documentation . 
  should you be coming from a country outside of schengen ( which you were ) then you just need to get through security , that 's all . 
   downvoted ... wow . 
  someone reports a possible violation of one of the fundamental rights we have as eu citizens and he gets shit . 
  unbelievable . 
  asking you a mere security question that is required ** by the law itself ** is not a violation of your `` fundamental rights '' , your rights to freely roam around the eu without visas are still the same but do n't act surprised that if you are crossing the borders of the schengen area , you 're gon na face security checks . 
  this got done to me already when i traveled from dublin to amsterdam , and seriously this is * not * a big deal . 
  how are you making such an entire big meal out of this ? 
  * it literally is standard procedure *, 
  in portuguese i just say the same way as english , `` meeem '' in french i say the word m\u00eame in the context ( m\u00eame in french means `` same '' but yeah it gets the point across and everyone says it like that as well ), 
   i ca n't even tell what it 's used for . 
  * oh i think i can help out * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  so you 're just going to ignore everything i just said , and the fact that * you * were the one who said :  you already do because if so i 'm pretty sure it 's visible you ran out of arguments and are just trying to make up a reply . 
  ** whats that you swedish/russian sauna whore ??? 
  i sure as fuck can not hear you over my gdp and everybody knows that philips kicks nokia 's ass any day of the week . 
  bitch i will dominate you like you 're the sea and put you on a stake for the glory of het wilhelmus **, 
   you already do no , we do n't live in fully automated luxury gay space communism . 
   said so you did n't because this undermines what you previously said about showy consumption with regards to honor . 
   like today ; if this is your personal aim : yes . 
  what if it is n't ? 
  so far you provided me * one * sad personal goal . 
   like a friend of mine once said : after the revolution there wo n't be no lovesickness any more ... 
  does not answer at all my concerns . 
  ** oh fucking hell to the no you fucking uralic sniper nokia-building moomin-man , i will drown you in the canals and build a goddamn polder over you **, 
   to be honest : many things people nowadays do are about honor , to most its even more important than money , beside the fact that having money gives honor , but earning it gives even more honor ; the people wear shity watches because its good for their status , and drive around in expensive but uncomfortable cars ; there are millionaires working almost sleepless driven by the need to show their capability to reach something they do n't need in monetary sense but as a tool to keep up their self-esteem and to show they are worthy , honorable , and yes there are others who like to side with people who show the status asked in their social peer group , they might as well be of the desired sex so it 's all about wearing masks and acting like i 'm something i 'm not then ? 
  just for `` honor '' ? 
  again , why would i want to live in this world ? 
  also , the definition of communism is :  a theory or system of social organization in which all property is owned by the community and each person contributes and receives according to their ability and needs . 
  so all those expensive cars , watches , etc. . . would be * everyone 's * and not mine . 
  and do i need them ? 
  of course not , so how would i get them under communism by its definition ? 
   you might get your name into history books ; people in the past made others build huge piles of stone which where of no practical use except to help people remember their name . 
  my whole entire life will be that then , trying to convince people i 'm important enough to be worth a mention in a book . 
  what about the average life ? 
  do they not matter ? 
   what made you think that economical equality due to the lack of penury level in the difference in personality and esteem ? 
  the only thing that vanished is poverty . 
  communism is not just about economic equality at all , check its definition , hell , even the way it 's written : communism , it 's basically stateless collectivism of * every * part of society . 
  i once was working at this pretty big supermarket in france , i was in the kid 's toy section ( restocking barbie stuff , sells very well ) . 
  incomes what i call the red menace , this russian trophy wife who without * any * other words will come at you with a random toy , cover up the back of the box with her hand , and ask `` what batteries does this take ??? '', 
  and then reacted badly when i asked her to show me the back of the box ( where it 's usually written ) . 
  fast forward a few years and i 'm just casually waiting outside a bar for a few friends to arrive . 
  incomes tourist rolling his bags with his passport on his hand ( seriously , he had his passport out for some reason ) and asks me ( or rather demands ) for money for a hotel . 
  i tell him i do n't have any money to give him ( all i had was my card and the student life is damn rough ) and he just shouts that i 'm lying and some other colorful stuff in russian . 
  and then there is this dickhead that wanted to go to the coffeeshop where i was in , and you got ta present your id before you enter ( it 's the law and * nobody * is above this one ) yet this one russian guy starts off by nearly fighting the security at the door because they wo n't let ** his 6 year old daughter ** into the coffeeshop . 
  these are just examples of what i 've seen , and nearly all tourists ( regardless of nationality ) are awful if noticed . 
  the good tourists are the ones you do n't see and the sole thing about them is that they speak english instead of dutch , that 's all . 
  ** do you mean poffertjes ??? 
  i will fight you and give your corpse back to sweden goddamnit **, 
  agreed . 
  i think it should be better funded , and not just for volunteering adverts on spotify that seem to do fuckall . 
  did you just call that pancake a \u0431\u043b\u0438\u043d with \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430 ? 
  ** soviet spy confirmed **, 
  rude damn tourists , and i mean really rude . 
  no `` hello '' no `` thank you '' no `` bye '' and extremely grumpy all the time , not to mention their tendency to ask you weird questions like it 's a pop quiz about the store you work in for * absolutely * no reason and always treating you like you 're not worthy of their business . 
  other than that , one of my teachers is russian and she 's pretty cool , she sometimes says things about `` westerns '' that make me feel a bit uncomfortable and her soviet volunteering is stressful as all hell ( she 's pretty damn severe ) but she also jokes quite a bit about russia itself ( sometimes even the geopolitical stuff ) and she 's generally nice and a very good teacher . 
   first thing is knowledge needs teaching , technology needs improvement , this will be honored things , when there is honor there are people who go for it and are willing to do anything to gain it , for example implement an ladder that leads all the honor , produced by others , to them , steal others works , teach wrong things to keep knowledge for themselves . . 
  but then what happened to communism ? 
  a society were we are all the same and equal ? 
  will the new class divide now be about honor instead ? 
  then we 're not equal , some are more honorable than others , and in that case , * why * would i want to be honorable ? 
  are there any advantages ? 
   and than there is love ... no human being is able to share his love equals to everybody and be satisfied with his share if his partner , or mother , does so ... so there is motivation that will keep the people at there toes ... and a need for security matters ; human ca n't turn into ants . 
  so it all comes down to * that * then ? 
  find love and ... then what ? 
  just live ? 
  i do n't see this at all as a utopia , but rather as a society where we 're useless , because everything 's done and there 's no real goal to reach , nothing that you * want * to do for a gain , just desire and no real incentive to work on absolutely anything . 
  makes sense , thanks for explaining !, 
  oooooooh , does a domestic passport get stamped too ? 
  if you go to different parts of russia like autonomous regions and such . 
  ... i am jealous that looks gorgeous . 
  i never knew this was actually a thing ... 
  in what occasions would a russian citizen use one ? 
  i 'm not sure what you mean , nations are people who believe they belong together on usually the basis of culture , so i do n't really know what you mean here . 
  i said that culture institutional facilities * should * be area-bound to current states and administered at state-level but also at an ever lower cascading regional level ** if need be ** so for catalonia , they would have a higher degree of autonomy in regards to cultural policy ( but not other state domains , at least not for this reason ) . 
  remember : states should * not * only be cultural administration and policy , for me they also should have some powers , such as deciding by themselves their permanent resident requirements for non-eu/non-efta immigrants . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean exactly , so i 'm not sure this answers what you said , if it does n't i 'm sorry .
