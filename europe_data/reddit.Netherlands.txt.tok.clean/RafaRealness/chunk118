  i think it explains about half of the groups , the other half tend to be older people than high school finalists ( 40 to 50 ) though by their accent in spanish * i think * they are mainly south american rather than spanish . 
  because let 's face it , hungary is ** mainly ** hungarian right ? 
  so why not have a * general * control over cultural policies and decisions at a national level , and for smaller minority communities , exceptions in the respective fields that they should require . 
  as i said , you need to integrate with the local scene , so in the case of belgium , you adopt the language and other elements of wherever you live . 
  if you speak hungarian in a city where 90 % + speaks hungarian then that 's that , not more to it . 
  if you speak spanish in catalonia , well , it may depend on the city itself , for example in barcelona it goes 50/50 so in this case it means you can do that in my opinion , but not in your example of odorheiu where you should primarily learn hungarian rather than romanian ( though i also believe that romanian should lightly be studied in at least an introductory level ), 
  i do n't think we should have nation-states as fully closed off states where nobody can be something else . 
  instead , we should remain with our current borders ( unless there really is a huge need for a change but i do n't see much happening in the continent right now ) and within , let 's say , poland , the polish national and cultural elements should be the dominant ones based on their population ; and cultural minority regions should address themselves to the polish state to negotiate a preservation of their cultural identity . 
  exploring polish culture should be embraced abroad as well , by giving the choice to travel to poland and really getting to know the roots of this culture and identity , and the same can be applied to minority cultures . 
  should you want to move to poland , then you 'd make a social contract to integrate by polish standards ( speak polish , accept their social norms , etc. . . ) or to the minority culture of the region you 're moving to . 
  this is an example , that i believe should be a blueprint/guideline on what culture can be like when it comes to national elements . 
  cultural particularities are embraced and maintained , and locally respected . 
  politics and culture for me should be more divided in a federal level , meaning that the supranational entities should remain mainly subsidiary in their role in culture . 
  culture should mainly remain an element to be controlled and administered more extensively state-level . 
  a european identity can exist , but we should * never ever * try to replace or underplay current national identities . 
  this is obviously what ** i ** think is ideal , and a lot of people may disagree in different degrees , so do n't take this as `` this is what will definitely happen '', 
  wait that 's jesus ? 
  oh ... ooooh nevermind now i see it . 
  out of curiosity , why is it called danmarks d\u00e5bsattest ? 
  i do , to collect stamps at checkpoint charlie !, 
  i 've only got a portuguese passport right now for myself , so it 'll have to do , sorry !, 
  the portuguese passport has a famous poet 's ( cam\u00f5es ) drawing ( not a picture , literally a drawing of him ) in the left first page , alongside with `` portuguese republic '' `` european union '' and `` passport '' written in a ton of different languages . 
  in the last page to the left we have some blabber in portuguese , english and french about what the passport includes and under what articles it is protected ( including art. 20 of the european community treaty and a website for consultation ) and to the right we see 3 drawings of another writer ( fernando pessoa ) as well as basic instructions that read ( translated by me ) :  1 . 
  this passport is property of the portuguese state with no loss of its titular 's rights . 
   2 . the titular of this passport must ensure its correct safekeeping and usage . 
   3 . in case of loss , destruction , theft or loss ( different type of loss ) , the titular must communicate such to the issuing entity . 
   4 . minors , when not accompanied by who exercises parental power , can only leave national territory showing authorization for the purpose . 
  i do n't believe all stereotypes have a basis of truth , past truths well sure , but not current . 
  amstelveen may , in the past , have been more of a ghetto-y area , just like de bijlmer or other parts that still get a shit reputation , but with time these will fade away . 
  in the mean time , i still hear `` oh amstelveen is a ghetto city eww lol '' comments about it , just like i hear that leiden is for daddy-rich frat boys , or that brabant is full of people like that new kids movie . 
   do you do stuff only because the judgment of others ? 
  no , i use my own judgement , and i do n't really see me being useful at all by just having everything handed to me and having nothing to build up on , there 's no career ladder , there probably wo n't be a social ladder ( communism will take care of that ) , nothing . 
  i 'd be bored , i want something to actually do and have an actual goal . 
  my goal right now is to study and work as best i can with my skill and energy to later be qualified for a better job , so that i can afford the things i want and need in life . 
  with automation , what is the point of doing any of this ? 
  if i can just have what i want when i want it ? 
  the more i think about it the more i do n't like this future , i do n't see a point on continuing doing anything in it , seems like just a luxury prison if anything . 
  my actions do n't matter , the outcome is the same , that is not the way i want to live . 
  what for ? 
  what 's the point of it all if no matter what you do , no matter what you do n't do , there is no penalty nor success ? 
  i think it 's a really shitty way of putting it , but for the most part yes . 
  i mean ...  the gay part is supposedly that there 's no intolerance or gender issues anymore . 
  * seriously ? 
  * the sole reservation i have is ... what the fuck do we do then ? 
  just live meaninglessly with everything already done for us ? 
  yes , in fact you actually * should * maintain it . 
  a european federalization does n't mean a loss of identity , because each state would still be celebrating its own culture ( s ) and language ( s ) freely , and the eu right now even has severe pushes for cultural development all over the continent . 
  the member states would have continuous control over their own cultural and educational practices and this diversity and plurality of cultures is already used for social and economic development with quite a bit of success , so why would we not motivate people to be proud of their state , and why would we stop motivating others to share and experience different european cultures ? 
  in ~ ~ diversitate ~ ~ varietate concordia , remember ? 
  not a lot of info at all , so my opinion for now is just `` well shit here it goes again '', 
  dude , chill , it 's something i 've * heard * about it . 
  not all stereotypes are accurate ( or do you seriously think the hague is full of hooligans and muslims ? ), 
  i 've heard the place i live is supposed to be a huge ghetto to ( de bijlmer ) yet it 's far from the truth . 
  stereotypes are stereotypes . 
  zeeland is dead , friesland is weird ( except for leeuwarden which is just sad ) , limburg is racist farmers , amstelveen is ghetto city , amsterdam is ego-centric maximus , rotterdam and the hague are full of hooligans and muslims . 
  i have heard a looot of stereotypes of different parts of the netherlands . 
  yes , i remember that , plus i remember that in berlin the bike paths are sometimes on the sidewalks , and tonnes of people would just walk on them ... * fuck sake *, 
  if you die , does this mean we get to annex whatever 's left ? 
  i can speak english , portuguese , french , spanish , and italian . 
  i know a bit of dutch and russian ( learning both ) and also a bit of german and danish . 
  americans : not that bad at all !, 
  just louder , but * usually * nice and curious . 
  french : snooty , believe nobody speaks french besides them , do n't care at all about culture or learning , go straight to beer weed and sex , but still they do n't really cause a disturbance 80 % of the time . 
  german : french without speaking french spanish/latin american : come in * laaarge * tour groups and visit random stuff around the city , usually not a problem but consider how tiny our streets are and how we all have places to go . 
  does n't help they sometimes stand in front of my university buildings by the entrance , and i am late for lectures/seminars because of them . 
  chinese : spanish/latin american but to a lesser extent , bit loud , leave trash everywhere for some reason . 
  general non-nationality problems : `` biking rules are for others lol '' , the use and abuse of airbnb , do n't let anyone pass on the streets as they walk painfully slow to look at everything and take selfies/pictures , trash everywhere , etc. . . / rant, 
  i love the way norwegian and swedish sound , and also a liiiittle bit czech when it 's sung . 
  non-european , i really like the way japanese sounds , and mandarin chinese . 
  now , now , they are n't the africa of europe , they are the mongolia of europe . 
  suicidal , quiet , nice people , very green ... 
  for portugal , it 's pretty bad . 
  seriously we just have a weird guy that is a bit full of himself that sings in a high pitch like his testicles are squeezed ever so often during the performance . 
  but it 's * way * better than some of the singers we 've had i guess , it could be far far worse . 
   the wealthiest ethnic group in the world ermm ... 
  so it 's * not * high because the * wealthiest * ethnic group averages it ? 
  we 're talking about a dutch citizen , chances are this person does not fit that description , so if you want to go based on ethnicity then i would advise you to compare it to the info we have on him , which does n't include any ethnicity . 
  furthermore , i fail to see how ethnicity out of all things matter here , but whatever suits you . 
  well i 'm busy making the sea my bitch in my clogs , but if he passes by i 'd gladly find some time to smoke up by the canals . 
   what makes me the least ashamed lithuanian flag checks out , do n't kill yourself please . 
  what makes me the proudest of portugal is how we were from a very repressive and conservative society to a more open one ready to deal with its own issues ( mostly ) like legalizing gay marriage , or also decriminalizing drugs . 
  what makes me the proudest of france is the political development and projects it historically has architectured . 
  sure it has made mistakes in the past ( paris commune , invading the suez , etc. . . ) but i am still proud of the beacon for new ideas that france historically was . 
  what makes me the proudest of the netherlands is far more simple : the simplicity . 
  i live with no hassles , the banks are very straight forward , and the public transports are easy to understand , so are housing contracts . 
  i feel like everything is designed so well compared to other places i 've been , that information is always available , and that help is as well but there is barely any need . 
  what makes me the proudest of europe is how we went from a decimated destroyed continent from ww2 into a reborn new place where we thrived . 
  we had communism and we had wars afterwards too but i am still proud that life here seems to slowly get better and better . 
  maybe it 's just history in its natural progress , but i am still so proud to see this place bloom , even with our problems . 
  yes , and in this case , it is easy to imagine that such a good paying job can not be performed just by * anybody * . 
  i have no idea how much this job would go for in the netherlands nor its requirements since i do not know what job it is . 
  it is hard to say what this all will matter in a context of this question , which was : staying in the us vs moving back to the netherlands, 
  all i learned about it was how the baltics were eaten up by stalin 's ussr , and then in 1990 lithuania ** checked the fuck out not having that soviet shit bye ** no but mainly that , we learned a tiny little bit about the singing revolutions in the baltic states . 
  i learned this when i was 16 in france . 
  around 38 119 $ +500 $ * 12 ( health coverage is monthly for that price i 'm guessing ) , so a total cost of 44 119 $ per year . 
  100 000 $ -44 119 $ = 55 881 $ 55 881 $ per year would mean an average of 4 656.75 $ per month . 
  4 656.75 $ is 4 392.12 $ per month * net gain * which considering that the dutch average salary for 2015 was 2 158 $ , it is very safe to assume that he holds a very good job that is in demand in the us . 
  how much is it after taxes & healthcare in america then ? 
  yeah , probably true . 
  i 'm at least glad we have the euro ( the football thing , i 'm glad for the currency too but that 's another story ) to begin with .
