  if we want to take in refugees we should set up a system to take them directly from countries like lebanon . 
  otherwise we are still encouraging people to drown at sea . 
  this system can work since none of the countries bordering the eu are at war , so the refugees are passing through safe countries , in which we can set up this system without anybody dying . 
  the system * could * work but keep in mind that these countries are not like ours , and religious tensions nest in that place like flies on honey . 
  in the case of lebanon it could be possible , but they also have problems with certain groups that could possibly attack them , so defense would be very expensive and risky as well . 
  conditions could possibly also be less attractive than the eu thus making refugees want to come here instead of the safe havens . 
  for me we need * far * more space and * far * more resources than before due to the fact that we * would * need a far bigger space , because consider that in a holding cell you need to coordinate every . 
  single . 
  part . 
  of their lives and needs and address them as per our human rights conventions , which is not only complex and extensive but also * lightly * against restriction of movement . 
   many of the vessels are already destroyed . 
  the traffickers put the migrants on very crappy vessels because they only have to make it 20km . 
  they do n't even bother to put fuel for more than 20km even though to italy it 's 400km . 
  when they see a ngo boat they jump off their vessel . 
  and that is why for me these ngos who help illegal migrants get into italy need to be prosecuted far more severely than they are now under the law . 
  especially , the * ngos * vessels should start being seized and destroyed since they are involved in what is blatantly a crime of human trafficking . 
   we got back into the seat belt issue . 
  do you also apply this logic to the fence around ceuta ? 
  again , you are twisting my words , what i 'm saying is that yes we * do * need better security , but we also need to address the fact that even * with * better security some will come through , ceuta already has refugees yet it has pretty strong security itself , so we need to be ready to deal with them , be it 1 or 1 000 . 
   it will only ever happen when they are in danger of losing their pet project ( and thus the nice jobs ) . 
  europe will be in major trouble by then . 
  i 'll make a prediction : as the weather becomes nicer the migrant stream will increase again , and the borders will stay as open as they are now and the stream will continue until it becomes winter again . 
  well , they constantly * are * at risk , especially the commissioners , because if they piss of the national governments * or * the european parliament they can be kicked out or blocked on everything . 
  they are pretty shook about the refugee crisis because it is already straining the eu 's reputation because of the belief that somehow the eu is accountable ( which it is n't it has no power over border patrol , that is still member state business ) . 
  plus if you take a look at the parliament , the assemblies , the statements , etc. . . you see that the eu is already working to try and find a solution to it within its own powers ( which are mainly market-focused and not designed to interfered with sociopolitical problems of this kind ) . 
  amen . 
  the backbone of western civilization as we know it .

  ** eeeeiiinigkeit und recht und freiheit f\u00dcr das deutsche vaaateeerlaaand ** sounds far too long , but still , could be ? 
   low-key impressed at that tbh, 
   you do n't need to let anyone die . 
  first of all frontex boats should patrol the italian border not the middle of the sea or even near the libyan border . 
  second , if it saves migrants who jump off a boat you do n't let them drown but you save them and put them in holding areas until they are willing to return . 
  the russian roulette we have set up where people have a chance at lifelong welfare checks in return for risking their lives at sea is crazy . 
  i agree , but the thing is that none of them are willing to return and there are even countries * paying money * for them to return to their home countries but to no avail . 
  furthermore if we do that we 'd have to have holding areas bigger and bigger than the ones we already do . 
  the process for a refugee to fully be granted asylum can take * years * alone for example . 
   exactly , these ngos should be prosecuted for human trafficking immediately . 
  agreed , there was a resolution passed to destroy the vessels of any human trafficker once everyone 's safe on land ( to prevent it from being a recurrent trend ) but it was a bit recent so i 'm still waiting to see how it was implemented . 
   not fully , but partially . 
  the swedish government has basically admitted that more people died due to its policy of diverting its aid budget to migrants . 
  i have n't really heard about this , like at all . 
  are you sure it was n't just dk ( their anti-europe party basically ) speaking ? 
   that would be much more effective especially in the long term . 
  the zero ` th priority should be to not create these messes in the first place . 
  the situation in libya was ok-ish before gadhaffi got killed . 
  trump said that he was going to do something like this . 
  there is a big chance that it will be viewed as evil infidels occupying muslim land though . 
  not if we have a cooperative regime on hand that was n't forced , for example morocco and france have good relationships and tunisian relationships are starting to warm up , lebanese relationships are also quite good . 
  so let 's focus on warming up relations and manage to strike a deal so that they do not see as infidels occupying muslim land , but rather a trade-off of `` you let me use this temporarily and i 'll invest in your infrastructure '' for example . 
   right , but just imagine how fast they would protect their borders if the surrounding countries closed their borders so that all migrants would stay in italy and greece . 
  if those borders had never been opened in the first place then this migrant crisis would never have happened like this . 
  the borders used to be close between portugal , spain , and france , and yet tonnes of portuguese people escaped both portugal and spain towards france , same for spanish people . 
  borders are n't full proof , austria even reinstituted border control but to no avail . 
  people * will * cross borders and we ca n't really help it even if we try , so we need an eu-wide response to this and not just let italy and greece get even more fucked over which would just aggravate the problem . 
   this would be ideal but it is very unlikely that this is ever going to happen . 
  there have been * some * motions that are slowly but steadily gaining popularity within discussions of the commission and was even mentioned in some past european councils , but it is true that it is still a goal very far away due to the implications of such a feat . 
   ideally , none . 
  in practice , there 'd be some minimum level of support ( e.g. 
  get 1000 people to sign a petition or something ) . 
   yup . 
  allow votes on everything and anything is the only way to get the `` bad ideas '' shown to be bad . 
  i agree to this to an extent , but as we 've seen a year or so ago in the netherlands , petitions that request referendums with lower thresholds makes referenda about issues with uninformed voters * not * voting for what is actually written but for whatever their leader says . 
  this constant exercise can also generate an exponential `` democratic fatigue '' which can generate lower and lower turnouts . 
   see to me ( and most of britain i believe ) the eu was only meant to be a trade organization , there to facilitate a common market - nothing more . 
  yes , these were the past goals of the eec back when the uk has joined , but if you apply a neo-functionalist theory towards the common market itself , you see the spillover effect on further fields would be inevitable and can bring about federalism , but the uk ( due to their radically different political culture as well as their institutional design ) merely never saw itself within this project , hence why i think that the uk should have done it like norway and been an efta member instead . 
  i support a progression of this project onto a more federal tone ( but i prioritize solving other issues first ) and less of a loose confederal one , but the uk tends to disagree a * lot * with this , hence why i believe it 's best for both if the uk leaves . 
   only if you mandate fully filling-out the vote . 
  the way i 'd do it would be that you can rank as far as you like : i.e. 
  first , second , and third out of 5 options if you like or just first , etc. 
  how many options should there be ? 
  and what should be the limitations of this system ? 
  i mean , imagine that i propose an option that states that all women should be revoked from voting , should such an option be allowed ? 
   i would support a fully federalized europe if the system of governance were n't so undemocratic and removed from the demos . 
  i fully agree with this , however i think that the * current * system is not democratic because it is not really a government , and a more democratic and direct system would take the eu from an inter * governmental * system towards a more federal one , which is something a lot of member states heavily oppose . 
  the eu is under the constant influence with the european council ( our national leaders ) , the council of ministers ( again , our governments ) , and the commission ( appointed by our governments ) ; for me this makes the eu less democratic not by its own choice ( it is pretty brainless to be honest ) but rather by our own governments who want the eu to stay in this shape of more of a confederal entity rather than a more federal one, 
  * okay that one i 'll let pass , that one was a good goddamn burn *, 
   ideally in my opinion ? 
  direct democracy . 
  in practice ? 
  `` the alternative vote '' is probably the best i 've seen proposed thus far . 
  but would n't the alternative vote system also cause the * least disliked * option to win vs the one who 's got the most approval ? 
   irrelevant . 
  if it 's not a devolved power , we are voting as the uk . 
  would you support a more federal system for the uk ? 
  okay so the people decide , but how , in practice ? 
  via constant referendums , via a representative democracy ? 
  if so , should n't the first-past-the-post be retired ? 
  and what about if two parts of the uk disagree heavily ? 
  it is n't as simple , and i 'd like to know what your idea of the best design and course of action is . 
  and what if these demos fall into deaf ears , as they have done in the past not only in the uk but also all over the world ? 
   indeed , but the eu is even further removed from the demos - and revolution against the eu is not possible from another country ( i.e. 
  the ultimate power of the demos ) . 
  the eu is not a government , and there have been demos in the past , even today there have been brexit demos remember ? 
  because it is a * national * decision to leave ( the eu ca n't really kick you out ) . 
  keep in mind that the eu has less staff working for it that the municipality of amsterdam ( no joke , this is actually a thing ) so it is by far not a government to begin with , and if you analyse the way it functions , you see that it is still very much an intergovernmental entity with * some * supranational features . 
   yes ... because you asked `` where you put your food down , where the limits should be for you '' . 
  let me rephrase : where should the limits be in the uk , as a country ? 
   greece , spain , italy , portugal , ireland , and eastern europe all say `` riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight '' . 
  a `` real '' common market can not exist without : common economic policy , common political policy , etc.
