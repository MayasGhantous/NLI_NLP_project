  yup . 
  agreed , although my mom watched it with me when i was a kid so we sometimes repeat a joke from it to remember the good ol' times, 
  i watched that movie in ` straya , and to be honest i liked it . 
  then again i was younger , so it might be a bit like jackass , where you like the overly stupid humor but you 're young and you 'll grow out of it . 
   two people having a disagreement of some kind is n't racism , just because they are n't the same race ( or ethnicity , religion , whatever ) . 
  it 's like that episode in south park when the black kid got angry at a white kid and cartman started screaming `` ooooh race waaaar '' . 
  nah it 's fine , i think a lot of us agree with you , fellow american . 
  i do n't think you 're being racist , a boner is pretty innocent . 
  if you say `` i 'm more attracted to white dudes '' it 's perfectly fine . 
  do n't date someone you do n't like , but do n't be a dick about it either . 
   see . 
  i can je a dick for no reason too . 
  you got that from our side of the family , i 'm so proud of you < 3, 
  ya , and guess what i think about christian advocacy groups against abortion who praise shootings of planned parenthood clinics in america agree with ? 
  that type of confrontational crap of raising awareness , `` spreading the word '' and stopping the `` cruelness '' people will not listen to you unless they want to actually inform themselves , and if they actually gave two fucks they will ask you , otherwise your words are falling in deaf ears and you are making a fool out of yourself . 
  i 'm an immigrant in the netherlands and i think that whoever voted pvv or denk can kindly french kiss my beautiful sweet ass , yet i do n't go around preaching because that would just entice them to keep on feeling like there is a boogie man out to get them and it would n't even matter . 
  what makes you think that a random person in , let 's say , manchester , can just approach a brexiter and tell them their story to change their mind ? 
  brexit fucking sucks and half of the ones who voted did not agree with it , but hey , i think that the vvd is n't the best for the netherlands but i 'm not going to get on up and preach about it , democracy does n't always turn out for the best , but to keep a democratic rule we need to be prepared with the potential fallout . 
  no , they made their choice and will have to live with it . 
  i do n't confront people who voted for pvv unless they ask me . 
  their decision so yeah . 
  i still find that debate extremely stupid to be fair , i 'd be glad to have more people to chill about * a stupid tiny tradition that lost its meaning ages ago *, 
  i never heard about it until now . 
  it seems like a cool show if you 're into horse racing , not my thing though . 
  petition to rename china to hanstan and india to hindustan or something . 
  it would be quite funny . 
  i miss being a kid learning french with this , it was the best show eveeer . 
  that english intro is so depressing holy crap . 
  the singers are so bored with it jesus . 
  the portuguese version of heidi [ it was already super old when i watched it , but my parents bought me some vhs tapes of a few episodes and i loved it so ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okck3mde6ac ) edit : i also really loved [ vickie the viking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djqc1e6g0na ) fun fact : i thought that vickie was a girl for the longest time , and was surprised there were lesbians at that age . 
  then i checked on the box and they used the * male * article for viking so it was actually a dude . 
  ... or the future of the second grand duchy of lithuania once you get everything back . 
  ** make lithuania great again ** / s, 
  aaaaaand / thread . 
  just when i thought that dude could n't be more ridiculous ... 
  is n't flanders even more europhile than us ? 
  and do n't they * seriously * want to steer clear from being a part of our kingdom ? 
   would i encounter any racism ? 
  if you stay away from the really crappy areas of france , germany , and the nordics ( small villages and such ) and focus on the better cities , you have absolutely nothing to worry about . 
   i know german and i 'm trying to learn french if the french judge you for not speaking perfect french do * not * take it to heart , it 's just what they do sometimes . 
  thanks for sharing an interest in our cultures !, 
  * sounds like a dane speaking while getting electroshocked * / s for me swedish sounds like a german/english hybrid that sounds like they are gagging without coughing . 
  it sounds like a very bad description , but i genuinely find it a quite beautiful language . 
  i could n't remember * what * they cut but i was 99 % sure it was something very important , just like that tribute . 
  only makes it even worse . 
  why not use compound words ? 
  english is a germanic language after all . 
  there is no real full logical reason for it other than that is just how english works . 
  same exact concept applies to german , it uses compound words because it 's just how german works . 
  you can ask yourself this :  what 's the deal with english and all the separate words ? 
  i refuse to let anyone watch that crap . 
  during the olympics the american version cut out a part of the 2012 olympics for an `` all exclusive interview with michael phelps '' and also asked the brazilians in 2016 to speak english instead of portuguese because `` viewers were getting bored '' . 
  ** i never trust american livestreams for a damn reason **, 
  ... but english has the * exact * same thing for some of its words like sunscreen or windshield . 
  i do n't get what your question means , in the least . 
  do they really need to ? 
  yes ? 
  i mean , does english really need to be written with separate nouns ? 
  my native languages have nearly no compound words but the germanic system of putting everything together seems pretty natural to me since it is a reference to * one * concept so it should be * one * word . 
  seriously ? 
  they did ? 
  * fucking extreme capitalism i swear holy shit * well , there 's always vpns , op can use a british one and slide right in . 
  yeah i still watch it , and lots of people around me do too . 
  sole thing is that nearly nobody actually takes the show seriously , it 's mainly just something fun to watch with friends . 
  singers are n't great but it 's fun to just chill and judge countries ' singers even with the universal agreement that since the 2000s they sucked ( few exceptions here n there like the 2009 winner ) . 
  this year i 'm getting together with friends for the final , we 're just gon na get smashed . 
  yes , and when it airs you can watch it live on youtube as well . 
  everything is also available on its website . 
  it 's very much a thing in the west , just look at france and portugal . 
  i agree that if you are deliberately harassing a nationality then it should be penalized as such . 
  what country ? 
  and why do you think it should be illegal ? 
  in portugal , any desecration of the republic 's symbols is punishable by law , but i do n't think it 's an actual issue since * nobody * really does that , and the few things we do ( mainly parodies of our anthem ) go unpunished since it 's not really an attack but rather just comedy . 
  in france you can not `` outrage '' the anthem nor the flag in an organized event . 
  this was mainly a response to rude damn cunts that would whistle and whatnot during the performance of la marseillaise . 
  since 2010 the law has been extended to also include * private * settings . 
  for the netherlands i have no idea what the current state of affairs regarding state symbols is , but culturally the dutch seem * way * less attached to their flags than france and portugal , to the point you see it far more rarely around the place and you ca n't even find it in the tweede kamer ( dutch parliament ) . 
  [ for what it 's worth , i found a poll that shows a 46/54 divide for the netherlands concerning their opinion ] ( https://nederland.isidewith.com/en-gb/poll/2924496367 ) my opinion is that it should not be illegal to burn your flag at all ( unless you 're a moron who stole a flag , but by then you already are a criminal ) , but if you do it as a method of hate enticement towards , say , gays or israelis or whatever , then you should be penalized not for desecrating a symbol but for calling for potential violence and hate . 
  totes , it 's a fake country , entirely made up by the obama administration . 
  there are tonnes of bad mensen there , we need to build a wall , and make zuid brabant pay for that wall ( wallonia sure as shit ca n't afford it ) . 
  yeah you 're right , pure entire fiction , france and germany hate each other !, 
  they are designed to be enemies , strasbourg is a battlefield and we benelux countries are just a northern border between the two !, 
  or we could have an even bigger and mightier lot for europe itself . 
  imagine it , a sexy sexy superstate , capable of immense power . 
  where all europeans are free to choose which part they identify with the most , and freely move there . 
  ** imagine the european federation **, 
  sorry , i should have been more clear about that !, 
  i can at least , because even though noord-brabant speaks a dialect closer to flemish , the vocabulary is still different between the two , and the accent of noord-brabant for me sounds * close * to flemish but not * fully * flemish , like it 's still 1/3 fully standardized dutch ( even with their weird gs ), 
   how easy is to tell someone 's from noord-brabant/flanders ? 
  ** extremely ** to me at least . 
  i do n't speak dutch very well , i must admit , but whenever i hear a belgian speak it or hear it on tv , i already can hear a very distinct different accent , and also the usage of different words . 
  or a lot of posh germans that need to be re-france 'd and celtified . 
  ** un - ** ** - even ** ** eu ** ** borders ** *** reeeeeeeee ***, 
  no , no , my german friend , we have a far bigger priority : ** switzerland . 
  / thread . 
  gibraltar for me is ( right now ) british , and not even spain has a problem with gibraltar being british , but due to brexit there is need for renegotiations , plus obviously spain is going to be less warm to a region known for being a bit of a gateway for smuggling and also a tax haven . 
  it 's really not like the falklands , and personally i think it 's extremely stupid to go to anything even remotely close to physical action over ** a place that is essentially a damn rock and is even called so ** . 
  nobody probably should care about * who * it belongs to , but mainly focus on * how * it will work . 
  spain , as part of the eu , gets a say on whatever deal is made over brexit , and obviously it 's not going to be too keen on keeping this status quo especially with the uk * outside * of the eu . 
  tl ; dr : there is basically no damn crisis , just a bunch of idiotic media about gibraltar for some reason .
